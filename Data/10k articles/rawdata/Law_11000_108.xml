The '''1926 Slavery Convention''' or the '''Convention to Suppress the Slave Trade and Slavery''' was an [[international treaty]] created under the auspices of the [[League of Nations]] and first signed on 25 September 1926. It was registered in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'' on 9 March 1927, the same day it went into effect.&lt;ref&gt;[https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/LON/Volume%2060/v60.pdf ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 60], pp. 254–270.&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of the Convention was to confirm and advance the suppression of [[slavery]] and the [[slave trade]].

==Background==
In the [[Brussels Conference Act of 1890]] the signatories "declared that they were equally animated by the firm intention of putting an end to the [[human trafficking|traffic]] in African [[slaves]]." The Brussels Act was supplemented and revised by the Convention of Saint-Germain-en-Laye signed by the Allied Powers of the [[First World War]] on 10 September 1919,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/LNTSer/1922/19.html United States of America - Convention revising the General Act of Berlin, 26 February 1885, and of the General Act and the Declaration of Brussels, 2 July 1890, signed at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, 10 September 1919 (1922) LNTSer 19; 8 LNTS 27]&lt;/ref&gt; in which the signatories undertook to "endeavour to secure the complete suppression of slavery in all its forms and of the slave trade by land and sea." (Art.11)

A Temporary Slavery Commission was appointed by the Council of the [[League of Nations]] in June 1924. The commission was mixed in composition including former colonial governors, as well as a [[Haitian people|Haitian]] and a representative from the [[International Labour Organization]]  [[Frederick Lugard]] was the British representative on the commission.

==Significance==
The '''1926 Slavery Convention''' established concrete rules and articles to advance the suppression of slavery and the slave trade.

Slavery was defined (Art.1) as: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;the status or condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers attaching to the right of [[ownership]] are exercised&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
and the slave trade was defined as including:
&lt;blockquote&gt;all acts involved in the capture, acquisition or disposal of a person with intent to reduce him to slavery; all acts involved in the acquisition of a slave with a view to selling or exchanging him; all acts of disposal by sale or [[Trade|exchange]] of a slave acquired with a view to being sold or exchanged, and, in general, every act of trade or transport in slaves.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Contents (summarised) ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Article 2'''&lt;br /&gt;
The parties agreed to prevent and suppress the slave trade and to progressively bring about the complete elimination of slavery in all its forms.

'''Article 6'''&lt;br /&gt;
The parties undertook to promulgate severe penalties for slave trading, slaveholding, and enslavement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Participants==
As of 2013, 99 countries have signed, [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties|acceded to]], [[ratification|ratified]], [[Succession of states|succeeded to]] or otherwise committed to participation in the Convention (as amended) and its subsequent Protocol. The countries and the year of their first commitment to participation (bracketed) are:

The '''1965 [[Constitution of Romania]]''' was drafted by a committee of the [[Great National Assembly]] (MAN) and approved by a plenary session of the Central Committee of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] on June 28, 1965. It was then debated at the party’s 9th Congress in July and adopted by the MAN, sitting as a Constituent Assembly, on August 21, being published in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'' that day.&lt;ref name="s93"&gt;Stoica, pp.93-4&lt;/ref&gt;  It was Romania's sixth constitution, and the third of the Communist era.

The document that formed the legal basis for the dictatorship of [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] (who had come to power that March), this constitution brought changes to the organisation and name of the state, and to the expression of its foreign policy.  It changed the state's official name from the Romanian People's Republic to the [[Socialist Republic of Romania]].  The “brotherly” alliance with the [[Soviet Union]] was replaced with the principle of “respect for national sovereignty and independence, equality of rights and reciprocal advantage, non-interference in internal matters”. The state enhanced its involvement in the [[Economy of the Socialist Republic of Romania|economy]] (“it organises, plans and leads the national economy”) and had a monopoly on foreign trade.  Like its [[1948 Constitution of Romania|1948]] and [[1952 Constitution of Romania|1952]] predecessors, it granted a series of freedoms, including speech, press, assembly, meetings and demonstrations.  These rights were effectively rendered theoretical in practice by a proviso that they could not be used "for purposes against the socialist structure and the interests of those who work."  As for the state organisation, alongside the MAN, which in theory remained the supreme leadership organ, the office of [[President of Romania|president of the republic]] appeared for the first time in Romanian history (via a 1974 amendment), with attributes that gave it, in the framework of the existing system, dictatorial powers.&lt;ref name="s93"/&gt;

The 1965 Constitution was modified 10 times between 1968 and 1986, after which it contained 121 articles in 9 titles. It was partly abrogated in December 1989, following the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Revolution]]; some clauses continued in operation until December 8, 1991, when [[Constitution of Romania|the current constitution]] was adopted.&lt;ref name="s93"/&gt;

The '''Agreement on the Conservation of Populations of European Bats''' is an international [[treaty]] that binds the Parties on the conservation of [[bat]]s in their territories. It was set up in 1991 under the auspices of the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), also known as "[[Bonn Convention]]". In July 2018, the Agreement covers 36 of 63 [[range state]]s.

== History ==
The Agreement was concluded as "Agreement on the Conservation of Bats in Europe" in September 1991 during the Third Meeting of the Parties of the Convention on Migratory Species. It entered into force on 16 January 1994, after the required number of five states (Germany, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and UK) had ratified it.

In 2000, the Parties decided to change the Agreement's name into its current form "Agreement on the Conservation of Populations of European Bats". In 2001, the Agreement became part of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP).

== Aim of the agreement ==
The overall goal of the Agreement is to provide a framework for [[bat conservation]] for the member states and those that have not yet joined. According to the agreement text, member states prohibit the deliberate capture, keeping or killing of bats except for research purposes for which a special permit is required. Furthermore, the member states identify important sites for bat conservation, survey the status and trends of bat populations and study their migratory patterns. Based on the result of these monitoring activities the Agreement develops and reviews recommendations and guidelines that shall be implemented by the Parties on national levels.

== Bodies of the agreement ==
=== Meeting of the parties ===
The Meeting of the parties is the highest decision-making body of the Agreement and adopts Resolutions. Every Party has one vote. Non-Party range states as well as bat conservation organisations may be represented as observers at the meetings.

The Meeting of the Parties takes place at changing locations every three to four years, most recently in Prague, Czech Republic, 20 – 22 September 2010. (Status: October 2012)

=== Advisory committee ===
The advisory committee is the working body of the agreement. It evaluates data and discusses scientific issues concerning bat research and conservation to set priorities for the Agreement’ future work. The committee deals with topics like bat migration, [[light pollution]] or the impact of wind turbines on bat populations. Furthermore, it drafts the Resolutions to be adopted at the Meetings of the Parties.

The Committee meets once a year, most recently in Dublin, Ireland, 15–17 May 2012. (Status: October 2012)

=== Standing committee ===
The standing committee is the administrative body of the Agreement. It monitors the execution of the Secretariat’s budget, oversees the implementation of policies by the Secretariat and discusses further administrative matters like staff issues. The Committee was established by the 5th Meeting of the Parties in autumn 2006 to redesign the Advisory Committee to scientific issues. 

The Committee shall meet once a year, if a meeting is needed, at the UN Campus in Bonn/Germany. The first Meeting took place in March 2007, the most recent one in Paris, France, on 28 March 2012. (Status: October 2012)

=== Secretariat ===
The Secretariat is the executive body of the Agreement. It coordinates and organises the activities of the Meeting of the Parties, the Advisory Committee and the Standing Committee and undertakes initiatives for implementing the aspired aims, attracting more member states and exchanging information. Furthermore, it coordinates international research and monitoring activities. 

Another main task of the Secretariat is to raise public awareness. The “[[European Bat Night]]” goes back to an initiative of the EUROBATS Secretariat and is today an event in more than 30 European states.

The Secretariat was established by the 1st Meeting of the Parties in 1995 and started its work in Bonn/Germany in 1996. Since June 2006 it is accommodated at the UN Campus in the former parliamentary building of the Federal Republic of Germany.

== Agreement area ==
The Agreement area covers continental Europe from the Caucasus and Turkey in the East to the Mediterranean coast in the South. In includes the British Isles, Cyprus and Malta and most of the islands belonging to European states (except the Canary Islands, Madeira and the Azores).

The '''Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents''', the '''Apostille Convention''', or the '''Apostille Treaty''', is an international treaty drafted by the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]]. It specifies the modalities through which a document issued in one of the signatory countries can be certified for legal purposes in all the other signatory states. A certification under the terms of the convention is called an '''apostille''' (from [[Latin]] ''post illa'' and then {{lang-fr|a marginal note}}) or '''Hague Apostille'''&lt;ref name=hcch_conclusions/&gt;. It is an international certification comparable to a [[Notary public|notarisation]] in domestic law, and normally supplements a local notarisation of the document. If the convention applies between two countries, such an apostille is sufficient to certify a document's validity, and removes the need for double-certification, by the originating country and then by the receiving country.

== Procedure ==
Apostilles are affixed by ''Competent Authorities'' designated by the government of a state which is party to the convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hcch.e-vision.nl/upload/abc12e.pdf|title=ABCs of Apostilles p.&amp;nbsp;13|publisher=[[Hague Conference on Private International Law]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A list of these authorities is maintained by the Hague Conference on Private International Law. Examples of designated authorities are embassies, ministries, courts or (local) governments. For example, in the United States, the Secretary of State of each state and his or her deputies are usually competent authorities. In the United Kingdom all apostilles are issued by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] in [[Milton Keynes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=authorities.details&amp;aid=352|publisher=[[Hague Conference on Private International Law]]|accessdate=9 March 2011|title=United Kingdom, Competent Authorities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be eligible for an apostille, a document must first be issued or certified by an officer recognised by the authority that will issue the apostille. For example, in the US state of [[Vermont]], the Secretary of State maintains specimen signatures of all notaries public, so documents that have been notarised are eligible for apostilles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vermont-archives.org/notary/guide/Notary5.htm Authentication] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730153503/http://vermont-archives.org/notary/guide/Notary5.htm |date=30 July 2010 }} 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, courts in the Netherlands are eligible to place an apostille on all municipal [[civil status]] documents directly. In some cases, intermediate certifications may be required in the country in which the document originates before it is eligible for an apostille. For example, in [[New York City]], the Office of Vital Records (which issues, among other things, [[birth certificate]]s) is not directly recognised by the [[New York Secretary of State]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://home2.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/vr/birth1.pdf Birth certificate application] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604161123/http://home2.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/vr/birth1.pdf |date=4 June 2010 }} 2010&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the signature of the City Clerk must be certified by the [[County Clerk]] of [[New York County]] to make the birth certificate eligible for an apostille.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomascrampton.com/2007/05/17/getting-a-ny-birth-certificate-with-apostille/ Crampton] 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dos.state.ny.us/corps/apostille.html ''Apostiles''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724143701/http://www.dos.state.ny.us/corps/apostille.html |date=24 July 2010 }} n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan all official documents are issued in Japanese; the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] (MOFA, JAPAN) can then provide an apostille for these documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/toko/todoke/shomei/index.html#1-1-2 Apostille, MOFA Japan] (''website in Japanese'')&lt;/ref&gt; In India the apostille certification can be obtained from the [[Ministry of External Affairs (India)|Ministry of External Affairs]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mea.gov.in/mystart.php?id=8801 MEA, India] Legalisation of Documents.&lt;/ref&gt; in New Delhi, after authentication by the administration of the Indian state where the document was issued (for educational documents).

==Information==
[[File:Apostille Norway.png|thumb|An apostille issued by Norwegian authorities.]]

The apostille itself is a stamp or printed form consisting of 10 numbered standard fields. On the top is the text ''APOSTILLE'', under which the text ''Convention de La Haye du 5 octobre 1961'' (French for “Hague Convention of 5 October 1961“) is placed. This title must be written in French for the Apostille to be valid (article 4 of the Convention). In the numbered fields, the following information is added (may be in official language of the authority which issues it or in a second language):

1. Country … [e.g. Korea, Spain] &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This public document &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
2. has been signed by [e.g. Henry Cho] &lt;br /&gt;
3. acting in the capacity of [e.g. Notary Public] &lt;br /&gt;
4. bears the seal/stamp of [e.g. High Court of Hong Kong]&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Certified &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
5. at [e.g. Hong Kong]  &lt;br /&gt;
6. the … [e.g. 16 April 2014] &lt;br /&gt;
7. by … [e.g. the Chief Executive of the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong] &lt;br /&gt;
8. No … [e.g. 2536218517] &lt;br /&gt;
9. Seal/stamp … [of the authority giving the apostille] &lt;br /&gt; 
10. Signature

The information can be placed on the document itself, on the back of the document, or attached to the document as an [[allonge]].

==Eligible documents==
Four types of documents are mentioned in the convention:&lt;ref name=convention/&gt;
*court documents
*administrative documents (e.g. civil status documents)
*notarial acts
*official certificates which are placed on documents signed by persons in their private capacity, such as official certificates recording the registration of a document or the fact that it was in existence on a certain date and official and notarial authentications of signatures.

== Legalization ==
{{main|legalization (international law)}}
A state that has not signed the Convention must specify how foreign legal documents can be certified for its use. Two countries may have a special convention on the recognition of each other's public documents, but in practice this is infrequent. Otherwise, the document must be certified by the foreign ministry of the country in which the document originated, and then by the foreign ministry of the government of the state in which the document will be used; one of the certifications will often be performed at an embassy or consulate. In practice this means the document must be certified twice before it can have legal effect in the receiving country. For example, as Canada is not a signatory, Canadian documents for use abroad must be certified by the Deputy Minister of [http://www.international.gc.ca/department-ministere/authentication-authentification_documents.aspx?lang=eng&amp;view=d Foreign Affairs] in [[Ottawa]] or by a Canadian consular official abroad, and subsequently by the relevant government office or consulate of the receiving state.

[[Saudi Arabia]] is not a party to the convention.&lt;ref&gt;Strong and Herd Import/Export Services, [http://www.strongandherd.co.uk/faqs/export/export-question-5/ A customer in Saudi has asked for our contract to be legalised, what does this mean?], accessed 23 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abuse==
The Apostille does not give information regarding the quality of the content in the underlying document, but certifies the signature (and the capacity of who placed it) and correctness of the seal/stamp on the document which must be certified. In 2005 The Hague Conference surveyed its members and produced a report in December 2008 which expressed serious concerns about Diplomas and Degree certificates issued by [[diploma mill]]s. The possible abuse of the system was highlighted "Particularly troubling is the possible use of diploma mill qualifications to circumvent migration controls, possibly by potential terrorists." (page 5) The risk comes from the fact that the various government stamps give the document an air of authenticity without anyone having checked the underlying document. "An official looking certificate may be issued to a copy of a diploma mill qualification, and then subsequently issued with an Apostille, without anyone having ever verified the signature on, let alone the contents of, the diploma." (page 7) Further member states indicated "they would be obliged to issue an Apostille for certification of a certified copy of a diploma issued by a diploma mill". (page 15) The evaluation commission of the Hague Conference expressed concern as to whether this issue could affect the entire convention.
"... the Apostille does not 'look through the certification' and does not relate to the diploma itself ... There is a clear risk that such practices may eventually undermine the effectiveness and therefore the successful operation of the Apostille Convention". (page 5)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hcch.e-vision.nl/upload/wop/2008pd05e.pdf | title = The application of the Apostille Convention to diplomas including those issued by diploma mills | date = December 2008 | publisher = Hague Conference on Private International Law | author = Permanent Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009 the Hague Conference recommended to amend the wording on the Apostille to make it clear that only the seal and the signature were authenticated. The wording to be added is:
"This Apostille only certifies the signature, the capacity of the signer and the seal or stamp it bears. It does not certify the content of the document for which it was issued."&lt;ref name=hcch_conclusions&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hcch.net/upload/wop/jac_concl_e.pdf | page=13 | title =  Conclusions and Recommendations of the Special Commission on the Practical Operation of the Hague Apostille, Service, Taking of Evidence, and Access to Justice Conventions | date = February 2009 | publisher = Hague Conference on Private International Law | author = Permanent Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''{{lang|la|Bona vacantia}}''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "ownerless goods") is a legal concept associated with property that has no owner. It exists in various jurisdictions, with consequently varying application, but with origins mostly in English law.

==Canada==
''Bona vacantia'' is applied according to the laws of the relevant province, and the roots of the laws may be traced to Roman law.

==New Zealand==
Similarly to England, unclaimed money will mostly revert to [[the Crown]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasury.govt.nz/services/unclaimedmoney The Treasurer (New Zealand) – Unclaimed Money]&lt;/ref&gt; who may then make further distribution. Unclaimed property other than money might also be claimed on behalf of the Crown but (as with the UK jurisdictions) this is not inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasury.govt.nz/services/bonavacantia treasury.govt.nz] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129010448/http://www.treasury.govt.nz/services/bonavacantia |date=November 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Kingdom ==

=== England and Wales ===
''Bona vacantia'' is partly a [[common law]] [[doctrine]] and partly found in statute. It deals with:

* Assets of dissolved companies that have failed to be distributed&lt;ref name=wmn&gt;{{cite news|title=Laws surrounding Duchy of Cornwall seen as 'mysterious, complex and arcane'|url=http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Laws-surrounding-Duchy-Cornwall-seen-mysterious/story-13893783-detail/story.html|accessdate=August 25, 2015|work=Western Morning News|publisher=Local World|date=November 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assets of dissolved [[Voluntary association|unincorporated associations]] that have failed to be distributed
* Assets of the estates of deceased persons that have failed to be distributed due to intestacy and a lack of known persons entitled to inherit&lt;ref name=wmn/&gt;
* Some failed trust property

For most of [[England and Wales]], the Bona Vacantia Division of the [[Treasury Solicitor's Department | Government Legal Department]] is responsible for dealing with ''bona vacantia'' assets on behalf of the Crown.&lt;ref name="BVD"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/bona-vacantia | publisher=gov.uk | work=Bona Vacantia Division | accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=doc&gt;{{cite web|title=Bona Vacantia and the Duke of Cornwall's Benevolent Fund|url=http://duchyofcornwall.org/bona-vacantia.html|website=Duchy of Cornwall.org|publisher=Duchy of Cornwall|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; If no heirs to an estate can be found then the assets are realised and the balance is transferred to HM Treasury. The division deals only with solvent estates whose net value exceeds £500.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/refer-a-deceased-persons-estate-to-the-treasury-solicitor&lt;/ref&gt; The assets of dissolved companies automatically pass to the Crown by law. They are realised by the division and the revenue passed to the Exchequer, although the division has a power to disclaim onerous assets.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bona-vacantia-dissolved-companies-bvc1/bona-vacantia-dissolved-companies-bvc1#disclaimers&lt;/ref&gt; Liabilities associated with assets do not automatically follow those assets into ''bona vacantia''. Care should be taken to distinguish between assets remaining when dissolution commences (which, e.g., might be distributed to shareholders or others in that process) and those that for various valid reasons remain undistributed at the end of dissolution. Some assets might only come to notice after dissolution has taken place.

==== Cornwall and Lancashire ====

For assets based in [[Cornwall]] and within the traditional boundaries of the [[county palatine]] of [[Lancashire]], [[Farrer &amp; Co]] solicitors deal with ''bona vacantia'' on behalf of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] and the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] respectively.&lt;ref name=doc&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bona Vacantia|url=http://www.duchyoflancaster.co.uk/duties-of-the-duchy/bona-vacantia/|website=duchyoflancaster.co.uk|publisher=Duchy of Lancaster|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, if no rightful owner is found for the assets, the assets legally pass to the respective duchies. Current practice for both is to donate these assets to charity. In Lancaster the beneficiaries are the [[Duchy of Lancaster Benevolent Fund]] and the [[Duchy of Lancaster Jubilee Trust]], while in Cornwall [[The Duke of Cornwall's Benevolent Fund]] receives the assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Inside the Duchy of Cornwall - part four| url=http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Inside-Duchy-Cornwall/story-26913549-detail/story.html#ixzz3jq6QnhYf |accessdate=August 25, 2015|work=Western Morning News|publisher=Local World|date=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the English King established in 1230 the Office of the Royal Escheator to centralize bona vacantia, Earl Edmund of Cornwall pressed his claim to bona vacantia by having his viscounts continue to handle them. Until the 1337 and 1338 Duchy Charters, the issue was contentious between the king and earl. In the Duchy Charters, the King formalized the bona vacantia right with the duchy.&lt;ref name=wmn/&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2015}}

=== Northern Ireland ===
In [[Northern Ireland]], ''bona vacantia'' is dealt with by the Crown Solicitor as the Treasury Solicitor's agent. The value of the assets collected in Northern Ireland are separately identified in the annual report of HM Procurator General and Treasury Solicitor Accounts for the Crown's Nominee.

=== Scotland ===
In [[Scotland]], ''bona vacantia'' deals with assets of dissolved companies, the assets of missing persons and lost or abandoned property; lost or abandoned property involves a statutory saving for the Crown in ss.67–79 of the [[Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crownoffice.gov.uk/About/roles/qltr/Bona-Vacantia Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service – Bona Vacantia]&lt;/ref&gt; It is mostly controlled by Common Law with some statutes dealing with specific matters such as lost property; the concept also extends to such matters as [[Treasure trove]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2003/11/18319/27604 – Review of Treasure Trove Arrangements in Scotland&lt;/ref&gt; The separate doctrine of ''[[ultimus haeres]]'' states that the assets of those who die intestate leaving no other person entitled to inherit pass to the Crown. Both of these rights, together with treasure trove, are administered by the [[Queen's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer]], an office held by the Crown Agent, the senior official in the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copfs.gov.uk/About/roles/qltr/Bona-vacantia  Official Website of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service of Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bona vacantia'' assets in Scotland are not aggregated with those from elsewhere in the United Kingdom, being paid directly into the [[Scottish Consolidated Fund]].

=== Crown dependencies ===

==== Guernsey ====
In Guernsey, assets of dissolved companies may become ''bona vacantia'' under s.369 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law, as amended, and are administered by the Receiver-General ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110521165259/http://www.gov.gg/ccm/navigation/government/law-officers/ ''HM Procureur'']).

==United States of America==
''Bona vacantia'' was inherited from English Common Law and continues in the form of [[lost, mislaid, and abandoned property]], applied only to personal property that has left the owner's possession, as opposed to an estate left in [[intestacy]] after death. Intangible personal assets such as checks, account balances, and securities are under unclaimed property law, varying by state. The states do not take permanent possession, but act as the custodian of the property in perpetuity on behalf of the rightful owner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llbc.leg.bc.ca/public/pubdocs/bcdocs2010_2/274670/unclaimed_intangible_property_administration.pdf British Columbia, Ministry of Finance and Corporate Relations – Unclaimed Intangible Property Administration in British Columbia]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bottom of the harbour tax avoidance''' was a form of [[tax avoidance]] used in [[Australia]] in the 1970s.  Legislation ([[#Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980|below]]) made it a [[Crime|criminal offence]] in 1980.  The practice came to symbolise the worst of variously contrived tax strategies from those times.

&lt;!-- cited in the AIC paper --&gt;
In its 1986/87 annual report, the [[Australian Taxation Office]] (ATO) stated a total 6,688 companies had been involved, involving revenue of between $500 million and $1 billion.

==Operation==

The operation at the heart of bottom of the harbour schemes was simple.  A [[company (law)|company]] would be stripped of [[asset]]s and accumulated [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] before its [[tax]] fell due, leaving it then unable to pay.

&lt;!-- Cities other than Sydney have harbours, but as far as the figurative "bottom of the harbour" went it usually referred to Sydney harbour.  See James Popple's article cited in the references for instance. --&gt;
Once assets were stripped, the company would be sent, metaphorically, to the "bottom of the harbour" by being transferred to someone of limited means and with little interest in its past activities.  The company's records were often lost too.  The ATO, being in the same position as other unsecured [[creditor]]s in the case of an [[insolvent]] company, ended up with nothing.

Promoters such as [[lawyer]]s or [[accountant]]s generally facilitated the transactions.  The promoter would help the owners of a company first transfer the assets to a new company which was to continue the business, then the owners sold the old company to the promoter for the value of the untaxed accumulated profits, less an amount representing a fee or commission.  For the owners this was the sale of a capital asset and hence untaxed (being prior to [[Capital gains tax in Australia|Capital Gains Tax]]).

The promoter would have the company pay (to the promoter) a dividend of the money it had left, then the promoter on-sold the now empty shell to someone else.  The way the promoter paid the owners for undistributed profits was similar to a [[dividend strip]] operation.  In any case the amount the promoter paid was a [[tax deduction]] (since the promoter would be in the business of buying and selling shares) and the dividend would be [[taxable income]], leaving just the promoter's commission taxable, not the whole original company profit.

The "harbour" in the expression was usually taken as referring to [[Sydney Harbour]]&lt;!-- see James Popple's article cited below--&gt; (which is adjacent to the financial district), though obviously the sense is also quite general.  The actual origin of the name and the practice is not clear.

==Deputy Crown Solicitor debacle==
The first time the [[Australian Taxation Office]] (ATO) detected a bottom of the harbour scheme was in 1973. Rod Todman, a senior investigations officer in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], found a scheme involving about 50 companies and selected one for investigation. By 1974, he had assembled evidence which was referred to the [[Australian Government Solicitor|Deputy Crown Solicitor]] (DCS) in Perth for possible prosecution as a [[Test case (law)|test case]].

The DCS was uncertain of the prospects for the case, but in late 1974 had a [[Queen's Counsel]] opinion strongly recommending charges of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to [[Fraud|defraud]] the Commonwealth be brought against the promoter and two other individuals. There then followed delay upon delay, duplicated investigations, ill-prepared reports by inexperienced officers, and even a DCS officer deliberately avoiding contact with the ATO.

After five full years, in April 1979, and based on miscommunication, the Crown Solicitor in [[Canberra]] advised the ATO that the evidence was insufficient and the case was dropped. It might well have been that it was not strong enough, but that decision was not arrived at in a well-considered way.  The performance of the various DCS officers was later the subject of scathing criticism, with problems arising primarily from overworked and underskilled staff, and bad management.

The abandoned case only came to light in 1982 in the [[Costigan Royal Commission]] investigating activities of the [[Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union]]. The Commission came upon bank account transactions for millions of dollars, and the "paper trail", as it was called, led eventually, and among other things, to the bottom drawers of the DCS Perth.

One of those other things the commission found was that the wife of one of the senior case officers at the DCS Perth was running an [[Prostitution#Escort/Out-call Prostitution|escort service]], and that she was a [[company secretary]] at several companies which were involved in bottom of the harbour schemes. There was no suggestion her husband improperly used his position, but the connection was close enough to be extremely embarrassing for all concerned, and the officer was dismissed.

==Legislation==

===''Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980''===
In 1980, the ''Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980'' put an end to bottom of the harbour schemes.  Under the act it became a [[Crime|criminal offence]] for any person to make a [[company]] or [[Trust (Law) non-USA|trust]] unable to pay tax debts ([[Income tax in Australia|income tax]], [[sales tax]], etc.), or to aid or abet any person or company doing so.  The act thus caught both those in the schemes and the promoters of such schemes.  It made it unnecessary to go through the crime of [[Fraud|defrauding]] the Commonwealth that had been so poorly handled at the Deputy Crown Solicitor above.

This act was controversial at the time, since [[tax avoidance]] was (and perhaps still is) regarded as something less than an outright [[crime]].  Tax matters might normally be addressed by closing a revenue loophole, the act instead treated bottom of the harbour schemes like [[fraud]]s.

===''Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Act 1982''===
The ''Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Act 1982'' went further, allowing for the recovery of tax avoided under bottom of the harbour tax schemes between 1 January 1972 and 4 December 1980.  The retrospectivity in this act was even more controversial than making the avoidance a crime.

[[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] [[John Howard]] said the normal reluctance against retrospectivity was "tempered by the competing consideration of overall perceptions as to the equity and fairness of our taxation system and the distribution of the tax burden." ([[Australian House of Representatives|House]], 23 September 1982).  [[Australian Senate|Senator]] [[Don Chipp]] thought the purpose noble but was strongly against retrospectivity, saying "I do not trust politicians to legislate retrospectively.  One of the few protections that the ordinary citizen has is that he knows the law." ([[Australian Senate|Senate]], 19 November 1982).

The [[Brazilian Penal Code]] defines an official or civil servant as follows: "Article 327 - ... those who, although temporarily or without pay, hold a position, employment or public usefulness. § 1 - Equivalent to a public official who holds a position, job or function in parastatal entity, and who works for the company providing the service or the private contractor for the execution of activity typical of public administration. "

==Legal Regime of Civil Servants==
Originally, the [[Constitution of Brazil]] had established a single legal regime that would apply to Federal entities for all hires. Subsequently, Constitutional Amendment number 19 relaxed this requirement by establishing the possibility of adopting the statutory regime or Hired Under Employment Laws, but was reinstated after the foregoing assessment of ADIn 2135.
The regulation of the legal regime of civil servants federal government, local and federal public foundations is carried out in Brazil under Federal Law no. 8.112/1990. Are not included in the legal regime established by this Act that federal employees are governed by the dictates of the [[Consolidation of Labor Laws]] and Federal Law no. 9.962/2000.
It should be understood that under the Federal Constitution of 1988, both regimes must respect constitutionally established rules, for example, all accepted by the public employer shall be subject to a tender or selection process.

Thus, in Brazil so-called statutory servants (connected to the system of Federal Law no. 8112) and servants called ''celetistas'', which obey the Consolidation of Labor Laws.
However, in order to grant interim with ''[[ex nunc]]'' effect on the date of August 2, 2007 ADIn in 2135, which suspended the effectiveness of EC 19 in that it modifies the chapeau of Article 39 for violation of the CF/1988 Article 60, II, of CF/1988 (vice-initiative), the Legal One has been restored.

==Tenure==
The term ''civil servant'' and ''tenured servant'' appear in the [[Constitution of Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil |quote=Constitutional text of October 5, 1988, with the alterations introduced by Constitutional Amendments No. 1/1992 through 64/2010 and by Revision Constitutional Amendments No. 1/1994 through 6/1994; translation: year 2010, 3rd edition. |publisher=[[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]], Documentation and Information Center, Publishing Coordination |year=1988 |url=http://english.tse.jus.br/arquivos/federal-constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 41 of the Federal Constitution states that "Servants who, by virtue of public entrance examinations, are appointed to effective posts, acquire tenure after three years of actual service."

Civil servants are listed as a category of public servants: they are permanent staff, professionals in the service of public administration. The [[Penal Code of Brazil|Brazilian Penal Code]], however, refers to a public official, which has a broader scope than the public servant. A board member, for example, who exercises a public function (help in the electoral process), is a civilian employee (in respect of acts performed as a board member), despite a transient and unpaid public role.

==Entrance==
Filling is the administrative act of filling public office in Brazil regulated by Law No. 8112 of November 11, 1990 [1].
Under the legislation, the provision may be given by appointment, promotion, rehabilitation, recovery, recovery, reintegration and renewal.Each of these forms of provision has a special significance in public administration and specify the legal form of access to public office in Brazil.

==Compensation==
The fee payment for services rendered to the state civil servant is given as follows:
*I Maturity: the cash consideration for the exercise of public office, with the rate fixed by law;
*II Remuneration: Salary is the effective position, plus the permanent pecuniary advantages determined by law;
*III Grant: is the exclusive and fixed fee payment in a lump sum, sealed the addition of any bonus, extra, bonus, award, grant or other type of representation remuneration. This type of pay is not the general rule and applies to cases that the law specify;
Earning. 
*IV: the return of money paid to exercente of public office when going from activity to inactivity, or when he retires;
*V board: cash is retribution paid to the persons to whom the law attributes the condition of receiving the public servant who died.
CF/88 Article 39 § 4: The State of Power, the holder of an elective office, Ministers of State and Municipal and State Secretaries shall be paid exclusively by fixed allowance in a lump sum, sealed the addition of any bonus, additional allowance, award, grant or other type of representation remuneration, obeyed in any case the provisions of art. 37, X and X
Any salary within the public service may exceed the value of allowances paid to Justices of the Supreme Court (STF) and the salaries of the offices of the Legislative and the Judiciary can not be higher than those paid by the executive. Despite these rules exist, many people are wondering if they are indeed obeyed.

'''Canadian Aboriginal law''' is the body of [[Canadian law]] that concerns a variety of issues related to [[Indigenous peoples in Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W., Constitutional Law of Canada. 2003 Student Ed. Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003, page 631.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Canadian Aboriginal Law is different than Indigenous Law. In Canada, Indigenous Law refers to the legal traditions, customs, and practices of Indigenous peoples and groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Sources of law ==

Aboriginal law is based on a variety of sources. The [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] is the foundation document creating special land rights for Indigenous peoples within Canada (which was called "Quebec" in 1763).  Section 91(24) of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' gives the federal parliament exclusive power to legislate in matters related to "Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Smith| first=David E.| title=The Republican Option in Canada| publisher=University of Toronto Press| year=1999| location=Toronto, Buffalo, London| page=16| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=76xNy6aexcgC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=monarchy+canada&amp;q=monarchy%20canada| isbn=0-8020-4469-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this power, that legislative body has enacted the [[Indian Act]], First Nations Land Management Act, Indian Oil and Gas Act, and the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Elkins |first=David J. |title=Any Lessons for Us in Australia's Debate? |url=http://www.irpp.org/po/archive/may99/elkins.pdf |periodical=Policy Options |date=May 1999 |page=23 |accessdate=10 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027064712/http://www.irpp.org/po/archive/may99/elkins.pdf |archive-date=2007-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part II of the [[Constitution Act, 1982]], recognizes Aboriginal treaty and land rights, with [[Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982|section 35]] being particularly important.

'''Charter of Duke Trpimir''' ({{lang-hr|Povelja kneza Trpimira}}), also known as '''Trpimir's deed of donation''' ({{lang-hr|Trpimirova darovnica}}) is the oldest preserved document of the [[Law of Croatia|Croatian law]], the oldest from the court of one of the [[List of rulers of Croatia|Croatian rulers]] and the first national document which mentions the Croatian name. Charter, dated to 4 March 852, is not preserved in its original form but in five subsequent transcripts out of which the oldest is from year 1568.

==Dating==
Dating of the Charter is contained in the following sentence in Latin: ''Regnante in Italia piissimo Lothario Francorum rege per indictionem XV sub die IIII Nonis Martii'' ({{lang-en|During the reign of a very pious Frankish king [[Lothair I]] in Italy, indiction 15, March 4}}).&lt;ref&gt;Klarić, Nada: Izvori za hrvatsku povijest, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians [[Daniele Farlati]] and [[Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski]] considered that the indiction XV refers to the year 837, while [[Johannes Lucius| Ivan Lučić Lucius]] considered that indiction refers to the year 838, which cannot be because of indiction.&lt;ref&gt;Stipišić, J.; Šamšalović M., ur. Codex Diplomaticus Regni Croatiae, Dalmatiae et Slavoniae, sv. 1. Zagreb: Izdavački zavod Jugoslavenske akademije znanosti i umjetnosti, 1967., p. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Franjo Rački]] corrected the opinion of Farlati and Kukuljević Sakcinski because Lothair I reigned as "Francorum rex", King of Franks, only since year 840, and also because, according to chronicler [[John the Deacon (Venetian chronicler)|John the Deacon]], Duke [[Mislav of Croatia|Mislav]] reigned over [[Duchy of Croatia]] in year 837. Accordingly, indiction XV can only refer to year 852.&lt;ref&gt;[[Franjo Rački|Rački, Franjo]]: ''Kad i kako se preobrazi hrvatska kneževina u kraljevinu'', [[Rad JAZU]] XVII, p. 201-204&lt;/ref&gt;

Miho Barada gave the first extensive palaeographic-diplomatic analysis to attempt to reconstruct the original text.&lt;ref&gt;Barada, Miho: Dvije naše vladarske isprave, Croatia sacra 7, p. 1-96.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, valuable contributions were also given by Lovre Katić&lt;ref&gt;Katić, Lovre: Prijepisi dviju najstarijih povelja iz hrvatske povijesti, Vjesnik za arh. i hist. Dalm. LI, p. 101-124&lt;/ref&gt; and Marko Kostrenčić.&lt;ref&gt;Kostrenčić, Marko: Nacrt historija hrv. države i hrv. prava, Zagreb 1956., p. 115-117.&lt;/ref&gt; Držislav Švob considered this Charter to be forgery from 14th century because of its "unconvincing arguments and arbitrary assumptions".&lt;ref&gt;Švob, Držislav: Krivotvorine o svetom Jurju Putaljskom, Vjesnik hrv. arh. društva, NS XVII, š. 195-207. &lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the debate on the issue was renewed by [[Lujo Margetić]] who thought that, because Lothari had already left Italy in year 840 and succeeded his father to the imperial throne, it is very unlikely that Trpimir was unaware of that change on the imperial throne even twelve years later. According to Margetić, the real date when the document was written would be March 4, 840.&lt;ref&gt;Margetić, Lujo: Bilješke uz Trpimirovu ispravu, Zbornik radova Pravnog fakulteta, p. 508.-509.&lt;/ref&gt; This Margetić's claim is supported by writings of John the Deacon according to which Justin was Archbishop of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in year 840 after Archbishop Petar which is mentioned in the Charter.&lt;ref&gt;Toma arhiđakon, Kronika. Uredio i preveo: Vladimir Rismondo. Čakavski sabor, Split, 1977, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Although the Charter is preserved in fragments it can be seen that the ruler ''(Dux Chroatorum)'' had almost unlimited power in the country, because Trpimir called himself "the ruler of the Croats by the grace of God". Charter proves the existence of Croats before Trpimir, because it confirms deed of donation given to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Split-Makarska|Archdiocese of Split]] by Trpimir's predecessor [[Mislav of Croatia|Mislav]]. In addition, Trpimir gave Church of St. George in Putalj and some other estates with associated [[Serfdom|serfs]] to the Archdiocese of Split. Charther shows that Croatia was a feudal state in formation and that the Croatian ruler had his state government which was made out of his courtiers and military and administrative officials, such as prefects and court chaplains. Trpimir also established the right of the [[Catholic Church]] to collect [[tithe]]. Feudal nature of the ruler's authority is confirmed by the fact that Trpimir had national territory and his own feudal domains. Although Trpimir acted as a real ruler, he was not formally independent, but was rather a [[vassal]] of the Successor of Frankish ruler in Italy, Lombardy king [[Lothair of France|Lothair]]. On the basis of this Charter, it can be concluded that the Croatian state finally emerged in the third decade of the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;Barada, Miho: Diplomatička analiza Trpimirove i Muncimirove isprave: U počast Mihe Barade*, Zavod za povijesne znanosti HAZU u Zadru, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authenticity==
The question of authenticity of the Charter has emerged from the beginning of its historiographical research. Doubts about the authenticity stemmed from problems with the dating, misunderstanding of certain language terms, and also from the fact that the copies of the Charter passed through many hands and that the Charter itself is vague and contradictory in many parts because of that. Some of the evidences that the Charter is authentic are for example terms ''mancipatio'' and ''mancipare''. According to Lujo Margetić, these terms indicate the ancient Roman forms of acquiring property and were at the time slowly disappearing as knowledge of [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] was growing by the activity of [[Glossator|glossators]], but they also linger at least in Italy even in the 9th century AD. Trpimir's and Muncimir's documents are evidence that those terms were known in Croatia. Olga Perić also came to the similar results noting that at least two old and different language layers can be found in the text of the Charter. Some interesting observations in support of Charter authenticity were presented by Neven Budak. First observation refers to the name of people from the Trpimir's escort that are mentioned in the [[eschatocol]] of the Charter, which points out that all the names are national, Croatian names, and not Christian, unless of course those from the priests. This is understandable because it was a time when only traditional names were prevailing among newly baptized nations. Budak disputes the contention that the institution of chaplain as a court scribe did not exist in the 9th century, stating that it is known in [[Bavaria]] in the 8th century and that it was accepted by [[Carolingian dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Matijević Sokol, Mirjana: 1150. obljetnica darovnice kneza Trpimira, Izdanja Hrvatskog arheološkog društva 25 (2010), p. 14. &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1088">A '''chiefage''', or '''chevage''', according to [[Henry de Bracton]], was a [[tribute]] by the head; or a kind of [[Tax per head|poll]]-money paid by those who held lands in [[villein]]age, or otherwise, to their lords, in acknowledgement.

The word seems also to have been used for a sum of money annually given to a man of power, for his patronage and protection, as to their chief.

In the first sense, [[Edward Coke]] observed, there was still a kind of ''chevage'' subsisting in [[Wales]] during his time, called ''[[amabyr]]''; paid to the [[Prince of Wales]] for the marriage of his daughters; anciently by all, and in Coke's time, only by some. 

[[William Lambarde]] wrote it ''chivage''. [[Jewish people]], when allowed to live in [[England]], paid chevage, or poll-money; ''viz.'' three pence per person, paid at [[Easter]].

The word is formed from the French ''chef'', head.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16333">A '''civil list''' is a list of individuals to whom [[money]] is paid by the [[government]]. It is a term especially associated with the [[United Kingdom]] and its former colonies of [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]]. It was originally defined as expenses supporting the monarch. Morocco has a civil list defined in its constitution of 1996.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the Civil List was, until 2011, the annual grant that covered some expenses associated with the Sovereign performing their official duties, including those for staff salaries, State Visits, public engagements, ceremonial functions and the upkeep of the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Households]]. The cost of transport and security for the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]], together with property maintenance and other sundry expenses, were covered by separate grants from individual Government Departments. The Civil List was abolished under the [[Sovereign Grant Act 2011]].

===History===
Following the "[[Glorious Revolution]]" of 1688, the expenses relating to the support of the monarch were largely separated from the ordinary expenses of the State managed by the [[Exchequer]]. This was a reaction to the reigns of [[Charles II of England]] and [[James II of England]] (also known as [[James VII of Scotland]]), whose large revenues had made them independent of [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In [[Civil List Act 1697|1697]], Parliament under [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] fixed [[The Crown]]'s peacetime revenue at £1,200,000 per year; of this about £700,000 was appropriated towards the Civil List.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol7/pp382-385|title=William III, 1697-8: An Act for granting to His Majesty a further Subsidy of Tunnage and Poundage towards raiseing the Yearly Su[m]m of Seven hundred thousand Pounds... [Chapter XXIII. Rot. Parl. 9 Gul. III. p. 4. n. 5.] {{!}} British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk|access-date=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Convention and Bill of Rights|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentaryauthority/revolution/overview/billofrights/|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sovereigns were expected to use this to defray some of the costs of running the civil government (such as the Civil Service, judges' and ambassadors' salaries) and the payment of pensions, as well as the expenses of the Royal Household and the Sovereign's personal expenses. It was from this that the term "Civil List" arose, to distinguish it from the statement of military and naval expenses which were funded through special taxation.

The accession of [[George III]] in 1760 marked a significant change in royal finances. As his predecessor, George II, had failed to meet all of the specific costs of the civil government in accordance with the previous arrangement, it was decided by the [[Civil List Act 1760]] that George III would surrender the hereditary revenues from the [[Crown Estate]] to Parliament for the duration of his reign, and in return Parliament would assume responsibility for most of the costs of the civil government. Parliament would continue to pay the Civil List, which would defray the expenses of the [[Royal Household]] and some of the costs of the civil government. George III, however, retained the income from the [[Duchy of Lancaster]].

On the accession of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] in 1830, the sum voted for the Civil List was restricted to the expenses of the Royal Household, removing any residual responsibilities associated with the cost of the civil government.  This finally removed any links between the Sovereign and the cost of the civil government. On the accession of [[Queen Victoria]], the [[Civil List Act 1837]]—which reiterated the principles of the civil list system and specified all prior Acts as in force—was passed. Upon the accession of subsequent monarchs down to [[Queen Elizabeth II]], this constitutional arrangement was confirmed, but the historical term "Civil List" remained even though the grant had nothing to do with the expenses of the civil government.

In 1931 [[George V]] decided to eschew the £50,000 due to him from the Civil List as a result of the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]]. As [[Keeper of the Privy Purse]], [[Frederick Ponsonby, 1st Baron Sysonby|Sir Frederick Ponsonby]] wrote to Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] to say that George had felt it was possible to reject the grant by "exercise of the most rigid economy" and that [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] and other royal family members were "desirous that reductions in these grants should be made during this time of national crisis".&lt;ref&gt;"Silence of the readers", ''[[The Times]]'', 22 August 1992; pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elizabeth II===
The last British monarch to receive Civil List payments was Elizabeth II. The Civil List for her reign lasted from her accession in 1952 until its abolition in 2012. During this period the Queen, as head of state, used the Civil List to defray some of the official expenditure of the monarchy.

Only the Queen, the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] and the [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Mother]] ever received direct funding from the Civil List.&lt;ref name=Indy_Royal&gt;{{cite news |last=Verkaik |first=Robert |title=Royal aides want to see abolition of Civil List |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/royal-aides-want-to-see-abolition--of-civil-list-606157.html |newspaper=The Independent|date=30 May 2002 |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prince of Wales]] and his immediate family (the [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Duchess of Cornwall]], the [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Duke]] and [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Duchess of Cambridge]], and [[Prince Harry]]) received their income from the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]. The state duties and staff of other members of the Royal Family were funded from a parliamentary annuity, the amount of which was fully refunded by the Queen to the treasury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sovereign Grant Act: main provisions |url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/leg_sovereign_grant_main_provisions.htm |publisher=HM Treasury |accessdate=8 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103012814/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/leg_sovereign_grant_main_provisions.htm |archivedate=3 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen's consort ([[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]) received £359,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is The True Cost Of The Monarchy?|url=http://www.royalcentral.co.uk/blogs/what-is-the-true-cost-of-the-monarchy-3032|publisher=Royal Central|date=17 February 2013|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen was permitted to claim these amounts as a deduction against her gross income from personal investments and other sources—the net amount, after deductions, was subject to normal income tax.

The last two decades of the Civil List were marked by surpluses and deficits. Surpluses in the 1991–2000 Civil List caused by low inflation and the efforts of the Queen and her staff to make the Royal Household more efficient led to the accrual of a £35.3 million reserve by late 2000. Consequently, the Civil List was fixed at £7.9 million annually in 2001, the same amount as in 1991, and remained at that level until its abolition. The reserve was then used to make up the shortfall in the Civil List during the subsequent decade.&lt;ref name=BBC_How&gt;{{cite news |author=Elena Egawhary |title=How the Civil List is spent |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10391693 |publisher=BBC News |date=23 June 2010 |accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Civil List Act 1972]] forbade parliament from reducing any of these payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alan Travis, home affairs editor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/may/30/politics.jubilee |title=Secret deals that obscure the royal finances &amp;#124; UK news |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The abolition of the Civil List was announced in the spending review statement to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 20 October 2010 by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[George Osborne]]. In its place, he said, "the Royal Household will receive a new Sovereign Support Grant linked to a portion of the revenue of the Crown Estate". The [[Crown Estate]] is a [[statutory corporation]], run on commercial lines by the Crown Estate Commissioners and generates revenue for [[HM Treasury]] every year (an income surplus of £210.7 million for the year ended 31 March 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = News Page - 2010 Annual Results | publisher = The Crown Estate | date = 15 July 2010 | url = http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/newscontent/92-2010-annual-results.htm | accessdate =  | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100822160837/http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/newscontent/92-2010-annual-results.htm | archivedate = 22 August 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This income is received by the Crown and given to the state as a result of the agreement reached in 1760 that has been renewed at the beginning of each subsequent reign. The [[Sovereign Grant Act 2011]] received [[Royal Assent]] on 18 October 2011. Under this Act, the Sovereign Grant now funds all of the official expenditure of the monarchy, not just the expenditure previously borne by the Civil List.

===Civil List pensions===
{{see also|Pensions in the United Kingdom#Civil List pensions}}
These are pensions traditionally granted by the Sovereign from the Civil List upon the recommendation of the [[First Lord of the Treasury]]. The [[Civil List Act 1837]] applied the condition that any new pensions should be "granted to such persons only as have just claims on the royal beneficence or who by their personal services to the Crown, or by the performance of duties to the public, or by their useful discoveries in science and attainments in literature and the arts, have merited the gracious consideration of their sovereign and the gratitude of their country."&lt;ref&gt;Civil List Act 1837 (c.2)&lt;/ref&gt; Famous recipients include [[William Wordsworth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32394070|title=The economy of literary form: English literature and the industrialization of publishing, 1800-1850|last=Erickson|first=Lee|date=1996|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=|isbn=0801851459|location=Baltimore|pages=76|oclc=32394070}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Barnes]],&lt;ref&gt;Chris Wrigley, 'Barnes, William (1801–1886)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1475 accessed 7 Sept 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geraldine Jewsbury]],&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Wilkes, 'Jewsbury, Geraldine Endsor (1812–1880)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14815 accessed 7 Sept 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Oliphant]],&lt;ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
In episode 3 of ''[[To Play the King]]'', Prime Minister [[Francis Urquhart]] (played by [[Ian Richardson]]) tells his political foe, the king (played by [[Michael Kitchen]]), that the government will take another look at the Civil List before holding a general election. The king observes that a full audit had been conducted the previous year, and Urquhart's proposed review appears vindictive.

==Canada==

In [[Canada]] the civil list was a common term during the [[Canada under British Imperial Control (1764-1867)|pre-confederation period]]; it referred to the payment for all officials on the government payroll.  There was much controversy as to whether the list would be controlled by the [[Governor]] or by the Legislative Assembly.  The Assembly demanded control of all money matters, while the Governors worried that if the Assembly was given this power, then certain positions would be delisted.  Eventually under the [[Robert Baldwin|Baldwin]]-[[Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine|Lafontaine]] government, a compromise was reached with [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]].

The term ''civil list'' is no longer commonly used to describe the payment of civil servants in Canada, who are covered in the budgets of executive agencies.

==New Zealand==

The [[Civil List Act 1979]] describes the funds provided for the [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]], [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]], [[New Zealand Cabinet|Cabinet Ministers]] and [[Parliament of New Zealand|Members of Parliament]].

==Morocco==
Article 45 of the 2011 Amended [[Moroccan Constitution]] states that the King shall have a civil list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maroc.ma/en/content/constitution |title=Constitution |publisher=Maroc.ma |date= |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar provision was contained in Article 22 of the 1996 Amended Moroccan Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un-dpadm/unpan041912.pdf|title=Morocco Constitution Adopted 13 September 1996|publisher=United Nations Public Administration Network |accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laws of Hywel Dda (f.4.r) Judge cropped.jpg|thumb|An [[illuminated manuscript|illumination]] of a Welsh judge (MS. Peniarth 28)]]
{{Culture of Wales}}
'''''Cyfraith Hywel''''' ({{IPA-cy|ˈkəvraiθ ˈhəwɛl|lang}}; ''Laws of [[Hywel]]''), also known as '''Welsh law''' ({{lang-la|Leges Walliæ}}&lt;ref&gt;Other names used by some manuscripts include ''Leges Howeli Boni'', ''Leges  Howeli Dha'', ''Leges Howelda'', ''Leges Wallicæ'', &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;), was the system of [[law]] practised in [[medieval Wales]] before its [[conquest of Wales by Edward I|final conquest by England]]. Subsequently, the Welsh law's criminal codes were superseded by the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] in AD 1284 and its civil codes by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s series of [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|Laws in Wales Acts]] between 1535 and 1542.

Welsh law was a form of [[Celtic law]] with many similarities to the [[Early Irish law|Brehon law]] of [[Ireland]] and particularly the customs and terminology of the Britons of [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Edward Lloyd|Lloyd, J.E.]] ''[https://archive.org/stream/historyofwalesfr01lloyuoft#page/286/mode/2up A History of Wales from the Earliest Times to the Edwardian Conquest], Vol. I, p. 287. Longmans, 1912. Accessed 5 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was passed down orally by jurists and bards and, according to tradition, only first codified during the reign of [[Hywel Dda]] in the mid-10th century. The earliest surviving manuscripts, however, are in [[Latin]], date from the early 13th century, and show marked regional differences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Wade-Evans, Arthur. ''[[s:Page:Welsh Medieval Law.djvu/13|Welsh Medieval Law]]''. Oxford Univ., 1909. Accessed 1 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The law is only known to have been revised by a few rulers (particularly [[Bleddyn ap Cynfyn]], who was credited with revisions retained in the [[kingdom of Powys]]) but was obviously updated by [[jurist]]s in response to changing jurisdictions and circumstances, so that the surviving manuscripts cannot be considered an accurate portrayal of Hywel's first code.

Notable features of Welsh law include the collective responsibility of kindreds (Welsh: [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cenedl cenedl]) for their members; the [[Gavelkind#Gavelkind in Wales|gavelkind]] inheritance of land among all and only male descendants; a status-based system of blood money (''[[galanas]]''); slavery and serfdom; the inability of foreigners to [[naturalization|naturalize]] earlier than the fourth generation; and very lax treatment of divorce and legitimacy that scandalized the non-native [[Christian views on divorce#Roman Catholic Church|clergy]].

==Overview==
The laws include the "laws of the court", the laws laying down the obligations and entitlements of the king and the officers of his court and the "laws of the country" dealing with every other topic. In some versions of the laws some of the material in the laws of the country are split off into the "justices' test book" dealing with homicide, theft and the values of wild and tame animals and other items. Within each of these sections there are tracts of varying length dealing with different subjects, for example the law of women and the law of contracts. Civil law differed from most other codes of law in the rule that on a landowner's death his land was to be shared equally between his sons, legitimate and illegitimate. This caused conflict with the church, as under [[canon law]] illegitimate children could not inherit.

Once a case came to court, the method used to come to a decision was usually by [[compurgation]]. Under this system the person accused or the parties to a dispute would give their version under oath, following which they had to find a number of others who would take an oath that the principal's oath could be trusted. The number of compurgators required depended on the nature of the case. The judge or judges would then come to a decision. [[Capital punishment]] was only prescribed for a small number of crimes. Homicide was usually dealt with by the payment of compensation to the victim's family, while theft could be punished by death only if it was theft by stealth and the thief was caught with the goods in hand; the value of the goods stolen also had to exceed four pence. Most other offences were punished by a fine.

==Origins==
Most of the surviving manuscripts of Welsh law start with a preamble explaining how the laws were codified by Hywel. The introduction to the Book of Blegywryd is a typical example:

{{quote|Hywel the Good, son of Cadell, by the grace of God, king of all Wales... summoned to him from every commote of his kingdom six men who were practised in authority and jurisprudence... to the place called the White House on the Taf in Dyfed. ... And at the end of [[Lent]] the king selected from that assembly the twelve most skilled laymen of his men and the one most skilled scholar who was called Master Blegywryd, to form and interpret for him and for his kingdom, laws and usages...''&lt;ref&gt;Richards ''The laws of Hywel Dda'' p.23&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Medieval Wales.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Medieval Kingdoms of Wales]]
As each of the manuscripts dates from centuries later than Hywel’s time, this statement cannot be used to date the event described above. Professor Huw Pryce has demonstrated that some of the prologues were developed in response to attacks on Welsh law by Church men and Nobles who wished to gain rights more akin to those enjoyed by Ecclesiastics and the aristocracy in England.&lt;ref&gt;Pryce, ‘The Prologues to the Welsh Lawbooks’, Bulletin of the Board of Celtic Studies 33 (1986), 151-182&lt;/ref&gt; In discussing Hywel’s association with the law, K. L. Maund suggests:

{{quote|it is not impossible that the association of Hywel with the law reflects more on twelfth- and thirteenth century south Welsh attempts to re-establish the importance and influence of their line in an age dominated by the princes of Gwynedd.''&lt;ref&gt;Maund ''The Welsh kings'' p.67&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the other hand, the Iorwerth versions, produced in Gwynedd, have exactly the same attribution of the law to Hywel and the council at Whitland as do the southern versions. It is more likely that Hywel’s name was used to lend some form of “ancestral authority" to the laws.

The best that may be said of Hywel’s association with the law is that a folk memory recalled a revision and rejuvenation of the law during his reign. Other kings are said to have introduced later modifications to the laws, for example [[Bleddyn ap Cynfyn]], king of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]] and [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]] in the mid 11th century.

Some of the legal material, such as the tract on the Seven Bishop Houses of Dyfed, may be dated to a very early period of law. Other material bears comparison with [[Early Irish Law]].

==Manuscripts==
[[File:ChirkCodex.png|200px|thumb|left|A page from the Black Book of Chirk (Peniarth 29)]]
[[File:Laws of Hywel Dda (f.5.r) Kissing couple.jpg|thumb|A page from a 13th Century Latin version of the laws of Hywel Dda. NLW, Pen.28]]
Although there are a substantial number of [[A list of Welsh Law manuscripts|manuscripts containing the law texts]], there are no existing manuscripts of law texts dating back to the time of Hywel and Welsh law was continually being revised and updated. There has been some debate among scholars as to whether the laws were originally written in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] or [[Latin]]. The ''Surexit'' memorandum in the [[Lichfield Gospels]] is a record of the outcome of legal proceedings dating from the 9th century and written in Welsh,&lt;ref&gt;For a translation of the Surexit memorandum see Charles-Edwards ''The Welsh laws'' p.75&lt;/ref&gt; and though it is not a law manual it does indicate the use of Welsh legal terms at that time. The earliest manuscripts known are [[Peniarth 28]], written in Latin but now generally thought to be a translation of a Welsh original, and Peniarth 29, known as the ''[[Black Book of Chirk]]'', written in Welsh.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} These are thought to date from the early or mid 13th century. There are a large number of law manuscripts, written mainly in Welsh but some in Latin, written between this period and the 16th century. Later manuscripts have been shown to reflect legal developments particularly in the Southern Welsh lordships.&lt;ref&gt;See S. E. Roberts, ‘Plaints in Welsh Mediaeval Law’, Journal of Celtic Studies 4 (2004), 219–61; G. A. Elias and M. E. Owen, 2013 `Lawmen and Lawbooks', in  Welsh Legal History Society XI, 106-51 and sources cited there.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the full compilations there are shorter versions thought to have been working copies used by judges. However they are all usually considered to fall into three Redactions, known as the Cyfnerth Redaction, the Blegywryd Redaction and the Iorwerth Redaction.

*The '''Cyfnerth''' Redaction, thought to be linked to the area between the [[River Wye]] and the [[River Severn]], possibly [[Maeliennydd]],&lt;ref&gt;Charles-Edwards ''The Welsh laws'' p.20&lt;/ref&gt; includes some of the least developed law. It is thought to have been compiled in the late 12th century when this area came under the rule of the [[Rhys ap Gruffydd|Lord Rhys]] of Deheubarth.
*The '''Blegywryd''' Redaction is associated with [[Deheubarth]] and shows signs of the influence of the church.
*The '''Iorwerth''' Redaction is thought to represent the law as modified in Gwynedd during the reign of [[Llywelyn the Great]] in the first part of the 13th century by the jurist Iorwerth ap Madog. This is considered to be the most developed version of the law, though it does contain some archaic passages. The version in ''Llyfr Colan'' is thought to be a revision of Iorwerth, though also from the 13th century, and there is also the ''Llyfr y Damweiniau'' (possibly best translated as "The book of happenings"), a collection of case-law linked to Colan. No manuscript has survived from [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]], though the Iorwerth Redaction does indicate where usage in Powys differs from usage in Gwynedd.

==Laws of the court==
[[File:Laws of Hywel Dda (f.4.r) Hawker cropped.jpg|thumb|Drawing of a falconer from Peniarth 28]]
The first part of the laws deal with the rights and duties of the king and the officers of the king's court. The order of precedence is set down: first the king, then the queen, then the {{lang|cy|etifedd}} or [[edling]], the heir. Next come the officers of the court; the Iorwerth Redaction identifies twenty-four, of whom sixteen are the king's officers and eight the queen's officers. First in rank was the captain of the household troops, then the priest of the household, then the steward followed by the chief falconer, the court justice, the chief groom and the chamberlain. A list of additional officers follows, including such officers as the groom of the rein, the porter, the bakeress and the laundress. Each officer's entitlements and obligations are listed.&lt;ref name="Laws of Hywel Dda: Jenkins, Dafydd"&gt;Laws of Hywel Dda: Jenkins, Dafydd&lt;/ref&gt;

It introduces a number of legal terms. ''Sarhad'' could mean an insult or injury or the payment that was due to a person in the event of an insult or injury, and this varied according to the status of the person concerned, for example the queen or the edling's ''sarhad'' was one third that of the king. ''[[Galanas]]'' was a form of [[weregild]] and represented the value of a person's life in the event of a homicide and was set at three times the ''sarhad'', though the ''sarhad'' was also payable by the killer. ''Dirwy'' was a fine payable for crimes and ''camlwrw'' a smaller fine for less serious offences, while ''ebediw'' was a death duty payable to the deceased's lord.&lt;ref name="Laws of Hywel Dda: Jenkins, Dafydd"/&gt; ''Sarhad'' and ''dirwy'' are still Welsh words meaning ‘insult’ and ‘fine’ respectively,

The origins of the various redactions are reflected in the relative position of the rulers of the Welsh kingdoms. The Iorwerth Redaction manuscripts proclaim the superiority of the king of [[Aberffraw]], chief seat of the kingdom of Gwynedd, over the others, while the manuscripts from Deheubarth claim at least equality for the king of [[Dinefwr Castle|Dinefwr]], chief seat of the southern kingdom.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

While Welsh law lays more emphasis on the powers of the king than the Brehon Law of Ireland, this is still restricted compared to many other codes. As Moore comments:

{{quote|Welsh law fell into the juristic category of Volksrecht (“people's law”), which did not lay great stress on royal power, as opposed to the Kaisersrecht or Königsrecht (“king's law”) of both England and Scotland, where it was emphasised that both civil and common law were imposed by the state.&lt;ref&gt;Moore ''The Welsh wars of independence'' p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Laws of the country==

===Classes===
{{see also|list of rulers of Wales|maenor|slavery in Britain}}
For the purposes of the laws, Welsh society was divided into five classes: the rulers, including the king (''rhi'' or ''brenin'') over his kingdom and the lords over their fiefs; the free Welsh, including both the pedigreed aristocracy (''boneddigion'' or ''uchelwr'') and the yeomen together; the Welsh serfs (''taeogion'', ''ailltion'', or ''bileiniaid''); foreigners resident in Wales (''alltudion''); and the slaves (''caethion'').&lt;ref&gt;Wade-Evans, p. [[s:Page:Welsh Medieval Law.djvu/448|448]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note that [[Aneurin Owen]], however, considered ''caethion'' as synonymous with ''ailltion'' by the time of Hywel. (''Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales'', Glossary).&lt;/ref&gt; The privileges, penalties, and obligations due by law varied with the social status of the person concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Dafydd. ''Law of Hywel Dda''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naturalization===
At the time of Hywel's laws, ''Cymry'' {{ndash}} the modern Welsh for all of the Welsh people {{ndash}} apparently only applied to the free classes and not to serfs or slaves. However, none of them counted as a "foreigner" and, even if they moved from one Welsh "kingdom" (''[[gwlad]]'') to another, they did not suffer that status but were considered fully native.&lt;ref name=WE433&gt;Wade-Evans, p. [[s:Page:Welsh Medieval Law.djvu/433|331]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Those from outside Wales were considered between serfs and slaves, forbidden to offer testimony, and obliged to pledge themselves to a native Welshman (even a serf&lt;ref&gt;Wade-Evans, p. [[s:Page:Welsh Medieval Law.djvu/427|325]].&lt;/ref&gt;) who would be responsible for them. This status could only be removed after three generations in the north and possibly as many as nine elsewhere, after which the foreigner's descendants were considered to be native serfs.

===Laws of women===
The position of women under Welsh law differed significantly to that of their Norman-English contemporaries. A marriage could be established in two basic ways. The normal way was that the woman would be given to a man by her kindred; the abnormal way was that the woman could elope with a man without the consent of her kindred. In this case her kindred could compel her to return if she was still a virgin, but if she was not she could not be compelled to return. If the relationship lasted for seven years she had the same entitlements as if she had been given by her kin.&lt;ref&gt;D. B. Walters ''The European context of the Welsh law of matrimonial property'' in Jenkins and Owen (ed.) ''The Welsh law of women'' p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of payments are connected with marriage. ''Amobr'', or commutation-fee, was a fee payable to the woman's lord on the loss of her virginity, whether on marriage or otherwise. ''Cowyll'', or maiden-fee, was a payment due to the woman from her husband on the morning after the marriage, marking her transition from virgin to married woman. Dowry (''agweddi'') was the amount of the common pool of property owned by the couple which was due to the woman if the couple separated before the end of seven years. The total of the agweddi depended on the woman's status by birth, regardless of the actual size of the common pool of property. If the marriage broke up after the end of 7 years, the woman was entitled to half the common pool.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins ''Hywel Dda: the law'' pp. 310–311, 329&lt;/ref&gt; The portion that was immediately accessible during the marriage, consisting usually of linens, dishes, and other domestic items, was known as ''argyvrau''.

If a woman found her husband with another woman, she was entitled to a payment of six score pence (i.e. half a pound) the first time and a pound the second time; on the third occasion she was entitled to divorce him. If the husband had a concubine, the wife was allowed to strike her without having to pay any compensation, even if it resulted in the concubine's death.&lt;ref&gt;Morfydd E. Owen ''Shame and reparation: woman's place in the kin'' in Jenkins and Owen (ed.) ''The Welsh law of women'' p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; A woman could only be beaten by her husband for three things: for giving away something which she was not entitled to give away, for being found with another man, or for wishing a blemish on her husband's beard. If he beat her for any other cause, she was entitled to the payment of ''sarhad''. If the husband found her with another man and beat her, he was not entitled to any further compensation. According to the law, women were not allowed to inherit land. However, there were exceptions, even at an early date. A poem dated to the first half of the 11th century is an elegy for Aeddon, a landowner on Anglesey. The poet says that after his death his estate was inherited by four women who had originally been brought to Aeddon's court as captives after a raid and had found favour with him.&lt;ref&gt;Jarman p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The rule for the division of moveable property when one of a married couple died was the same for both sexes. The property was divided into two equal halves, with the surviving partner keeping one half and the dying partner being free to give bequests from the other half.

===Criminal law===
{{anchor|murder|galanas|rape|theft|trial by combat}}
[[File:Boston Welsh Law Ms (f.6.v).jpg|thumb|The 'Boston Manuscript'. An annotated 14th century Welsh version of the laws (f.6.v)]]
[[Homicide|Murder]] was regarded as an offence against the family rather than against society or the state. It was normally dealt with by the payment of blood money (''[[galanas]]'') by the killer ''and'' his extended family to the family of the deceased. The base sum was computed by the social status and position of the victim. The ''galanas'' of the king of Deheubarth was set at an impossibly long line of impossibly perfect cattle to ensure it could never be met; the family of a murdered slave, meanwhile, received no ''galanas'', although the slave's owner was to be compensated for the loss. This sum might then be modified in certain situations (for example, an attack from ambush doubled the base fine). Upon the payment of the blood money, the victim's family was then legally bound to forgo its vengeance (''dial''). Murder by poison, however, carried the death penalty.

[[Assault]] or offenses against [[honor]] were dealt with in a similar fashion, through a fine called ''sarhaed''. However, it only applied to the upper classes: any serf who struck a free man was to liable to have the offending limb removed.&lt;ref name="Annie"/&gt;

The crime of [[rape]] was treated as a theft and remedied by the payment of another fine (''dirwy''), payment of which restored the woman's virginity for legal purposes. A man who could not pay the fine was to have his testicles removed.&lt;ref name="Annie"/&gt;

Similarly, a convicted thief was imprisoned in the first instance, but a serf convicted for the third time was to have his hand removed.&lt;ref name="Annie"/&gt; (Assuming he was not caught in the act: thieves caught with goods in hand more valuable than four ''[[ceiniogau]]'' were liable for hanging.&lt;ref name="ll306"&gt;Lloyd, p. [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwalesfr01lloyuoft#page/306/mode/2up 306].&lt;/ref&gt;) Such strong penalties led the Welsh to narrowly define "theft", however: forcible [[robbery]] was considered much less serious. Further, a hungry man who had passed at least three towns without receiving a meal could not be punished for stealing food.&lt;ref&gt;Richards. ''The law of Hywel Dda'', p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Aiding and abetting {{ndash}} including witnessing a killing and failing to protect the victim or receiving stolen property {{ndash}} was also punished with ''dirwy'' fines.

Although Hywel's commission generally recorded the traditions of the country, one modification they made was to end the right of nobles to trial by combat, finding it unjust.&lt;ref name="Annie"&gt;Owen, Aneurin. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=T9MLAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA622 Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales: comprising laws supposed to be enacted by Howel the Good and anomalous laws, consisting principally of institutions which by the statute of Ruddlan &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''sic''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; were admitted to continue in force]'', Vol. II. Public Record Office of Great Britain, 1841. Accessed 5 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compensation===
Medieval Welsh law placed a high value on compensation for any breach of the law. In particular, high and detailed compensation values
were given for each limb of the body. There are nine limbs of equal value (that is the hands, the eyes, the lips, the feet, and the nose) each of which is valued at 480 pennies, every other limb is carefully
valued and can be altered depending on various influencing factors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The values given to eyes, ears, nose, lips, hands, and feet are identical; termed as the ‘Limbs of equal value’ they represent 12.7% of the standard ''[[galanas]]'' for a ''boneheddig'' (A ''boneheddig'' is a standard free-man, whose ''galanas'' is valued at 3780 pennies/ 63 cows).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Compensation for injury: a point of contact between early Welsh and Germanic law?|last = Harris|first = M.E.|date = 2002|journal = The Trial of Dic Penderyn and Other Essays|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no additional complexities to any of these costs, except when it comes to ears. The Iorwerth manuscripts and LATIN A do not value the ear itself at 480 pennies, instead they differentiate between the loss of an ear and the loss of hearing. If the ear is lost but the victim can still hear, then the price lies at 160 pennies, whilst deafness (even without the loss of ear) retains the 480 penny value. This is a rare example of a ‘functional value
being given where the loss of the function of the ear... is appreciated and not the organ itself’.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Harris notes that although these members are all given equal value, it seems there is some underlying notion that some are perhaps more essential than others (at least in the Iorwerth and LATIN A texts) with hearing being more
important than any of the other senses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Fingers are valued at 80 pence each, whilst a thumb has a value of 180 pence which corresponds to its use in ‘gripping agricultural equipment or arms’.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Iorwerth and Cyfnerth 5 recensions value a finger nail at 30 pence, whilst the top of the finger to the first knuckle is valued (in the same texts) at 26 2/3 of a penny.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The price of a fingernail as it is valued in Iorwerth and Cyfnerth is 0.8% of
the ''galanas'', and intriguingly the thumbnail in the Wessex tariff also stands at 0.8% of the ''wergild'' value for the man.[7] Harris argues that these similar percentages reflect the co-existence of two legal systems in Wales; the Welsh and the English.

The triad known as the ''Tri Arberygl Dyn'' (Three Dangerous wounds of man) specifies three injuries for which&lt;blockquote&gt;‘teyr punt a geyf y nep a archoller y gan y nep ay harchollo’ &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;‘He who is wounded shall have 3 pounds from him who wounds him’.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;These are; when a man is cut so that the brains can be seen, when a man is pierced so his entrails can be seen, and when one of the four posts of the body (the limbs) are broken.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Medics and medicine|last = Owen|first = M. E.|date = 2000|journal = The Welsh King and his Court|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body parts appear to be classed for compensation based on how much use they have in society. The higher the use; the higher the compensation cost. Loss of hearing, for example, as well as loss of testes and/or penis incur very high redress rates, because their loss will cause either danger or an inability to continue lineage, which was highly important in such a kin-based society. The tongue is also particularly high because, as with the ear, it would have formed the primary means of communication for the victim.

Also notable are the different grades of compensation given to wounds depending on the degree of disfigurement produced by the wounding, with a differentiation between ''craith ogyfarch''; a conspicuous scar which attracts remarks, and ''craith guiddiedig''; a hidden scar which will therefore attract less remarks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The ''craith ogyfarch'' afforded the most compensation, but the value of the ''ogyfarch'' compensation varied according to its noticability. The three most conspicuous scars are given as those on a face (six score pence), on a hand (sixty pence), and on a foot (thirty pence), whilst a hidden scar is given only four pence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Latin texts A and E ‘make provision for a cloak to cover facial disfigurement’ and front teeth were also accorded a higher value than other teeth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Surety and contracts===
The section on surety lays down the rules if a person acts as ''mach'' or [[surety]], for example for a debt, and gives the provisions for various cases, such as where the debtor refuses to pay or denies the debt and where the surety denies the suretyship or contests the sum involved. Rules are also given for the giving and forfeiting of gages. Another aspect is ''amod'' or [[contract]], usually made by the two parties calling ''amodwyr'' who are witnesses to prove the terms agreed by the parties. It is laid down that:

{{quote|An amod breaks a rule of law. Though an amod be made contrary to law, it is necessary to keep it.''&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins ''Hywel Dda'' p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In what is thought to be an archaic survival in some versions of Iorwerth it is stated that women are not entitled to act as sureties or to give sureties. Later versions of this rule in Iorwerth state that women were entitled to give sureties, and could therefore enter into contracts, though they were still not allowed to act as sureties. In Colan, Cyfnerth and some of the Latin texts women could give sureties and could under certain circumstances act as sureties. This appears to indicate a gradual improvement in the legal position of women in this respect.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Chapman Stacey]], ''The archaic core of Llyfr Iorwerth'' in Jenkins and Owen  ''Welsh law of women'' pp. 22–27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land law===
This is followed by land law, setting out the procedure in the event of rival ownership claims over land. Court was convened on the land itself, with both claimants calling witnesses to support their claims. In the Iorwerth Redaction, it is stated that the claimants were entitled to the representation by both types of lawyer - ''cyngaws'' and ''canllaw''. If both claims were deemed to have equal merit, the law allowed for the land to be shared equally between the two claimants.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

On the death of a landowner (''priodawr'') his immovable estate (land) passed in [[joint tenancy]] (''cytir'') to his sons, similar to the [[gavelkind]] system of [[Kent]]. Then the youngest son partitioned (''cyfran'') the land equally, and each brother took his share. Illegitimate sons were entitled to shares equal to those of legitimate sons, provided they had been acknowledged by the father. This provision differed the most from [[canon law]]; as the Iorwerth text puts it:

{{quote|The law of the church says that no-one is entitled to patrimony (''treftadaeth'') save the father's eldest son by his wedded wife. The law of Hywel adjudges it to the youngest son as to the eldest, and judges that the father's sin and his illegality should not be set against the son for his patrimony.''&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Dafydd Jenkins ''Property interests in the classical Welsh law of women'' in Jenkins and Owen (ed.) ''The Welsh law of women'' p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Dadannudd'' is a son's claim to land which previously belonged to his father. A landowner's right to convey land was restricted; it was only allowed under certain circumstances with the consent of his kindred and coheirs (''laudatio parentum''). With the consent of the lord and the kindred, the landowner could use the [[gage (finance)|living gage]] (''prid''). The land would be made over to a gagee (''pridwr'') for a period of four years, and if the land had not been redeemed by the gagor (owner) or his heirs at the end of the four years, the gage could then be renewed for additional four-year periods. After three renewals (or 16 years total), the land passed permanently to the gagee.&lt;ref&gt;T. Jones Pierce ''Medieval Welsh society'' p. 384&lt;/ref&gt;

===Succession===
From the [[sub-Roman Britain|time of the fall of Rome]], Wales was divided into numerous petty "kingdoms" (''[[gwlad|gwledydd]]'', &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "peoples"&lt;ref&gt;Wade-Evans, p. [[s:Page:Welsh Medieval Law.djvu/444|342]].&lt;/ref&gt;) which were repeatedly unified and then redivided. It is frequently stated that Welsh law demanded the division of a kingdom between all the ruler's sons, but that is a misunderstanding of the inheritance law {{ndash}} the crown itself was unitary but the king's ''[[desmesne|lands]]'' (''maertref'') were required to be divided among all of his acknowledged sons by whatever mother. This naturally weakened the position of the new king and that weakness, along with the long free and separate traditions of the various Welsh ''gwledydd'', then permitted disputes and civil wars among the family [[appanage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Stephenson's ''Governance of Gwynedd'', pp. 138–141.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, by the time of Hywel, the kingdoms normally taken as independent {{ndash}} [[kingdom of Deheubarth|Deheubarth]], [[kingdom of Powys|Powys]], &amp;c. {{ndash}} were nominally subordinate to the elder line of the family in [[kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]] and bound to display that with annual gifts.

The confusion of the 11th century and the use of the Saxon loanword ''edling'' for the heir also seem to have clouded the issue. By law, the principal homestead (and presumably the realm) were to go to the king's eldest son, but this was subject to several important provisos:

:(''a'') First, the son could not be damaged in any limb, blind, deaf, or mentally retarded.&lt;ref name="Owe687"&gt;Owen, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=T9MLAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA687 687].&lt;/ref&gt;
:(''b'') Second, although this was not explicitly codified,&lt;ref&gt;Unless implicit in the requirements for mental maturity above.&lt;/ref&gt; it seems to have been the case that the heir must be of age (around 27&lt;ref&gt;Wolcott's treatment ignores that the Welsh often counted inclusively (that is, their rule would state "14" or be "28" but the year intended would be our "13" or "27").&lt;/ref&gt; or 28 years old) to qualify as an ''edling''.&lt;ref name="MinAge"&gt;Wolcott, Darrell. "[http://www.ancientwalesstudies.org/id45.html Minimum Age for Welsh Kingship in the 11th Century]". Accessed 5 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The eldest son of a king who died before that was barred from direct inheritance but possessed the right to retake the throne himself on the attainment of majority. The number of princes rebelling just prior to their 30th year may even indicate that they were ''required'' to assert their rights at that point or lose them.&lt;ref name="MinAge"/&gt; If the eldest son were ineligible for whatever reason, his brothers, uncles, and first and second cousins were all considered legitimate substitutes.&lt;ref name="Owe687"/&gt; Likewise, even when the eldest son did inherit, other descendants of his great-grandfather were considered legitimate rulers and not usurpers if they were able to wrest control away from him.

Finally, although our surviving editions of Hywel's law explicitly forbid inheritance by or through female members of the royal family,&lt;ref name="Owe687"/&gt; Hywel's line itself derived from lords of [[Isle of Man|Man]] who had (allegedly) married into the dynasties of Gwynedd and Powys and there are numerous examples through the 11th century of kings asserting their legitimacy on account of royal mothers, despite surviving underage representatives of the male line of succession.

==The justices' test book==
This is only a separate section in the Iorwerth Redaction; in the other versions the material is incorporated in the "Laws of the country" section. It is a compilation of the rules for dealing with the "Three Columns of Law", namely cases of homicide, theft and fire, and "The Value of Wild and Tame". There are also appendices dealing with joint ploughing and corn damage by stock.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

===The value of wild and tame===
"The value of wild and tame" gives the values of various animals, for example:

{{quote|the value of a cat, fourpence. The value of a kitten from the night it is born until it opens its eyes, a penny, and from then until it kills mice, two pence, and after it kills mice, four pence...

A guard dog, if it is killed more than nine paces from the door is not paid for. If it is killed within the nine paces, it is worth twenty-four pence&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins ''Hywel Dda'' pp. 180, 182&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Values are also given for trees, equipment and parts of the human body. The value of a part of the body was fixed, thus a person causing the king to lose an eye would pay the same as if he had caused a villein to lose an eye. However he would also have to pay ''sarhad'', and this would be far greater for the king than for the villein.

==Administration of the law==
The main administrative divisions of mediaeval Wales were the [[cantref]]s, each of which was divided into several [[commote]]s. These were of particular importance in the administration of the law. Each cantref had its own court, which was an assembly of the "''uchelwyr''", the main landowners of the cantref. This would be presided over by the king if he happened to be present in the cantref, or if he was not present by his representative. Apart from the [[judge]]s there would be a clerk, an usher and sometimes two professional pleaders. The cantref court dealt with crimes, the determination of boundaries and matters concerning inheritance. The commote court later took over most of the functions of the cantref court. The judges (Welsh ''ynad'') in Gwynedd were professionals, while in south Wales the professional judges worked together with the free landowners of the district, all of whom were entitled to act as judges.&lt;ref&gt;Charles-Edwards ''The Welsh laws'' p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

A person accused of a crime could deny the charge by denying it on oath and finding a certain number of persons prepared to go on oath that they believed his or her own oath, a system known as [[compurgation]]. The number of persons required to swear depended on the gravity of the alleged crime; for example denying a homicide could require 300 compurgators, while if a woman accused a man of rape, the man would have to find 50 men prepared to swear to his innocence. For lesser crimes a smaller number would be sufficient. Witnesses could also be called, including eyewitnesses of the crime (''gwybyddiaid''). A witness who has once been proved to have given false testimony on oath was barred from ever appearing as a witness again.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

The task of the judge, having considered the case, was to determine what sort of proof was appropriate and which of the parties was to be required to produce proof, whether by the calling of witnesses, by compurgation or by pledges, then in the light of the proof to adjudicate on the case and impose the appropriate penalty in accordance with the law if a penalty was called for.&lt;ref&gt;R.R. Davies ''The administration of law in medieval Wales: the role of the Ynad Cwmwd (Judex Patriae)'' in Charles-Edwards, Owen and Walters ''Lawyers and laymen'' p.267&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Iorwerth Redaction, a prospective judge had to be at least twenty-five years of age and his legal knowledge has to be approved by the Court Justice:

:''... when his teacher sees that he is worthy, let him send him to the Court Justice, and it is for the Court Justice to test him, and if he finds him worthy, it is for him to send him to the Lord and it is for the Lord to grant him justiceship ... And it is for him to give twenty-four pence to the Court Justice as his fee.''&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins ''Hywel Dda'' p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

It was possible to appeal against a judge's decision, and the apellant could demand that the judge show the authority of a book for his judgment. The consequences for a judge could be serious if his judgement was reversed, involving a financial penalty equivalent to the value of his tongue as laid down in the values of the parts of the body. He would also be banned from acting as a judge in future.&lt;ref&gt;Charles-Edwards, Owen and Walters ''Lawyers and laymen'' p.339&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of the Norman and Edwardian conquests==

===Marcher lordships===
{{See also|Marcher lords|Norman invasion of Wales}}
Welsh law usually applied in the [[Welsh Marches]] as well as the areas ruled by Welsh princes. In the event of a dispute, the first argument in the border regions might be about which law should apply. For example, when [[Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn]] was in dispute with [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Wigmore|Roger Mortimer]] about some lands, it was Gruffydd who wanted the case heard under English law and Mortimer who wanted Welsh law to apply. The matter went to the royal justices, who decided in 1281 that since the lands concerned lay in Wales, Welsh law should be used.&lt;ref&gt;Moore ''The Welsh wars of independence'' p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edwardian conquest===
{{See also|Conquest of Wales by Edward I}}
Welsh law came to be a particularly important badge of nationhood in the 12th and 13th centuries, particularly during the struggle between Llywelyn the Last and King [[Edward I of England]] in the second half of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;See the account of the dispute over land in [[Arwystli]] between Llywelyn the Last and Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn supported by Edward I and its implications in Davies ''Conquest, coexistence and change: Wales 1063–1415'' pp. 346–7&lt;/ref&gt; Llywelyn stated:

{{quote|Each province under the empire of the lord king has its own laws and customs according to the peculiarities and uses of those parts where it is situated, as do the Gascons in Gascony, the Scots in Scotland, the Irish in Ireland and the English in England; and this conduces rather to the glory of the Crown of the lord king than to its degradation. And so the Prince seeks that he may be able to have his own Welsh law...&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Charles-Edwards ''The Welsh laws'' p.12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[John Peckham]] when involved in negotiations with Llywelyn on behalf of King Edward in 1282 sent Llywelyn a letter in which he denounced Welsh law, stating that King Hywel must have been inspired by the devil. Peckham had presumably consulted the Peniarth 28 manuscript which was apparently held in the library at [[St. Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury]] at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Huws, ''Leges Howelda at Canterbury'' in The National Library of Wales Journal, XIX (1976), pp. 340–4
&lt;/ref&gt; One of the features to which the English church objected was the equal share of land given to illegitimate sons. Following Llywelyn's death the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] in 1284 introduced English criminal law into Wales: "in thefts, larcenies, burnings, murders, manslaughters and manifest and notorious robberies&amp;nbsp;— we will that they shall use the laws of England".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Williams ''Recovery, reorientation and reformation'' pp. 35–6&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly two hundred years after Welsh law ceased to be used for criminal cases, the poet Dafydd ab Edmwnd ([[floruit|fl.]] 1450–80) wrote an elegy for his friend, the harpist Siôn Eos, who had accidentally killed a man in a tavern brawl in [[Chirk]]. Siôn Eos was hanged, and Dafydd ab Edmwnd laments that he could not have been tried under the more humane Law of Hywel rather than "the law of London".&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Thomas. ed. ''The Oxford book of Welsh verse''. Oxford University Press, 1962. pp. 138–141&lt;/ref&gt;

Welsh law was still used for civil cases such as land inheritance, contracts, sureties and similar matters, though with changes, for example illegitimate sons could no longer claim part of the inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Davies ''Conquest, coexistence and change'' p.368&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542]] brought Wales entirely under English law; when the 1535 Act declares the intention ''utterly to extirpe alle and singular sinister usages and customs'' belonging to Wales, Welsh law was probably the main target.

==Welsh law after the Laws in Wales Acts==
The last recorded case to be heard under Welsh law was a case concerning land in [[Carmarthenshire]] in 1540, four years after the 1536 Act had stipulated that only English law was to be used in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Charles-Edwards ''The Welsh laws'' p.93&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the 17th century in some parts of Wales there were unofficial meetings where points of dispute were decided in the presence of arbiters using principles laid down in Welsh law.&lt;ref&gt;T. Jones Pierce ''Medieval Welsh society'' pp. 386–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Antiquarian interest in the laws continued, and in 1730 a translation by [[William Wotton]] was published. In 1841 Aneurin Owen edited an edition of the laws entitled ''Ancient laws and institutions of Wales'', and was the first to identify the various Redactions, which he named the "Gwentian Code" (Cyfnerth), the "Demetian Code" (Blegywryd) and the "Venedotian Code" (Iorwerth). His edition was followed by a number of other studies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Carmarthenshire County Council has set up the Hywel Dda Centre in Whitland, with an interpretative centre and garden to commemorate the original council.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hywel-dda.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Contemporary Welsh Law]] is a term applied to the body of primary and secondary legislation generated by the [[National Assembly for Wales]], according to devolved authority granted in the [[Government of Wales Act 2006]]. Each piece of Welsh legislation is known as an [[Act of the National Assembly for Wales]]. The first Assembly legislation to be officially proposed was called the [[NHS Redress (Wales) Measure 2008]]. These powers have been effective since May, 2007. It is the first time in almost 500 years that Wales has had its own laws, since Cyfraith Hywel was abolished and replaced by English law through the Laws in Wales Acts, passed between 1535 and 1542 by King Henry VIII of England.

==In later fiction==
Ellis Peters in her [[Cadfael]] cycle often uses the ancient Welsh laws. The novel called ''[[Monk's Hood]]'' mentions the  ''Cyfraith Hywel'' (called Hywel Dda). A recognised son, born out of wedlock has an over-riding claim to his father's property. The manor is in Wales. His demand could be accepted because the manor, lying in Wales, is under Welsh law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4190">'''Daniel R. Fischel''' (born December 10, 1950) is the emeritus Lee and Brena Freeman Professor of Law and Business and former [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of [[University of Chicago Law School]]. He co-founded [[Compass Lexecon|Lexecon]], and is now chairman and president of [[Compass lexecon|Compass Lexecon]].

==Early life and education==
Fischel was born in [[New York City]]. He graduated from [[Cornell University]] in 1972, and received a M.A. in American history from [[Brown University]] in 1974.  Fischel received his J.D. ''cum laude'' from [[University of Chicago]]'s Law school in 1977, where he was comment editor of the [[University of Chicago Law Review|law review]] and elected to the [[Order of the Coif]].

==Career==
After graduation, Fischel clerked for Judge [[Thomas E. Fairchild]] of the [[Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]] and Justice [[Potter Stewart]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. He taught at [[Northwestern University Law School]] from 1980 to 1983, the last year of which he was a visiting professor at his alma mater.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/fischel&lt;/ref&gt; Fischel joined the [[University of Chicago]] Law faculty in 1984, and served as Dean from 1998 to 2001, when he resigned due his marriage to another University employee and the University's anti-nepotism policy.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-02-06/news/0102060046_1_law-school-anti-nepotism-private-lives&lt;/ref&gt; During his time as Dean, he famously tried to convince [[Barack Obama]] that his political career was finished following his resounding defeat to [[Bobby Rush]] for U.S. Congress.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/30/us/politics/30law.html&lt;/ref&gt; He also drew controversy in 2009 for his purchase of a condominium in New York for over $8 million,&lt;ref&gt;http://abovethelaw.com/2009/10/lawyerly-lairs-daniel-fischels-fabulous-new-pad/&lt;/ref&gt; which he sold for nearly $12 million in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/daniel-fischel-apartment-for-sale-photos-2012-2&lt;/ref&gt;

As an expert witness, Fischel testified on behalf of [[Charles Keating]],&lt;ref&gt;http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/09/04/286801/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Lay]], and [[Jeffrey Skilling]].&lt;ref&gt;http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/11/news/companies/enron_fortune/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; His work concerning the collapse of [[Lincoln Savings and Loan]] upset plaintiffs' law firm [[Milberg Weiss]], leading Fischel and Lexecon to file a [[defamation]] and abuse of process suit, which led to a Supreme Court decision about [[multi-district litigation]] (''[[Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &amp; Lerach]]'', 523 U.S. 26 (1998)) and a $50 million settlement paid to him and/or his firm.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/14/business/law-firm-to-pay-longtime-foe-50-million.html&lt;/ref&gt; A panel of the [[Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals]] reversed the conviction of [[Joseph Nacchio]] over alleged [[insider trading]] of [[Qwest]] because Judge [[Edward Nottingham]] would not let Fischel testify on Nacchio's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. v. Nacchio,519 F.3d 1140 (10th Cir. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; but the entire Circuit en banc reversed the reversal&lt;ref&gt;http://m.startribune.com/business/40311757.html&lt;/ref&gt; and Nacchio ultimately served jail time (being released in ≤2013).

Fischel co-authored with [[Frank Easterbrook]] The Economic Structure of Corporate Law (Harvard University Press, 1991). His book, "Payback", argued that the prosecution of [[Michael Milken]] was unjust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Passion of Professor Fischel: Defending Milken's Financial Revolution |doi=10.1111/j.1747-4469.1997.tb01097.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patent]]-related uncertainty around [[elliptic curve cryptography]] (ECC), or '''ECC patents''', is one of the main factors limiting its wide acceptance. For example, the [[OpenSSL]] team accepted an ECC patch only in 2005 (in OpenSSL version 0.9.8), despite the fact that it was submitted in 2002.

According to [[Bruce Schneier]] as of May 31, 2007, "Certicom certainly can claim ownership of ECC. The algorithm was developed and patented by the company's founders, and the patents are well written and strong. I don't like it, but they can claim ownership."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| last=Fulton, III

| publisher=betanews.com
| accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, [[NSA]] has licensed [[MQV]] and other ECC patents from [[Certicom]] in a US$25 million deal for [[NSA Suite B]] algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| publisher=[[Certicom]]
| accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (ECMQV is no longer part of Suite B.)

However, according to [[RSA Laboratories]], "''in all of these cases, it is the implementation technique that is patented, not the prime or representation, and there are alternative, compatible implementation techniques that are not covered by the patents.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| deadurl=yes
| accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, [[Daniel J. Bernstein]] has stated that he is "not aware of" patents that cover the [[Curve25519]] [[elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman]] algorithm or its implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Known patents==
* [[Certicom]] holds a patent on efficient ''GF(2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;)'' multiplication in normal basis representation.
* Certicom holds multiple patents which cover the MQV ([[Alfred Menezes|Menezes]], Qu, and [[Scott Vanstone|Vanstone]]) key agreement technique.
* Certicom holds {{US patent|6563928}} on technique of validating the key exchange messages using ECC to prevent a man-in-the middle attack. It expires in 2019.
* Certicom holds {{US patent|6782100}} on calculating the x-coordinate of the double of a point in binary curves via a Montgomery ladder in projective coordinates. The priority date is Jan 29, 1997 and the filing date Oct 2, 2000. Claims disclosed in the original patent application have expired but some claims may still be enforceable until 2020.
* US [[National Security Agency]] holds {{US patent|4567600}}, {{US patent|4587627}}, {{US patent|6212279}}, {{US patent|6243467}} on efficient ''GF(2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;)'' calculations in [[normal basis]] (all of these patents expired or lapsed (as Google shows) due to failure to pay fees)
* [[RSA Security|RSA Data Security]] holds {{US patent|5854759}} on efficient [[Numeral system|basis conversion]]. It expires in 2017.
* [[Hewlett-Packard]] holds {{US patent|6252960}} on compression and decompression of data points on elliptic curves. It expires in 2018.

According to the NSA, Certicom holds over 130 patents relating to elliptic curves and public key cryptography in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It is difficult to create a complete list of patents which are related to ECC, but a good starting point is [[SECG|Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group (SECG)]] – a group devoted exclusively to developing standards based on ECC.  There is controversy over the validity of some of the patent claims.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Certicom's lawsuit against Sony==
On May 30, 2007, Certicom filed a lawsuit against [[Sony]] in [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas]] [[Marshall, Texas|Marshall]] office, claiming that Sony's use of ECC in [[Advanced Access Content System]] and [[Digital Transmission Content Protection]] violates Certicom's patents for that cryptographic method. In particular, Certicom alleged violation of {{US patent|6563928}} and {{US patent|6704870}}. The lawsuit was dismissed on May 27, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| date=2009-05-27
| publisher=justia.com
| accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stipulation states, "Whereas Certicom and Sony have entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which they have agreed to a dismissal without prejudice, these parties therefore jointly move to dismiss all claims and counterclaims asserted in this suit, without prejudice to the right to pursue any such claims and counterclaims in the future." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Flynn was raised a [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Roman Catholic]], and graduated from [[University College, Galway]].&lt;ref name="iehc2"&gt;[1985] IEHC 1, sec.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheehan" /&gt; She began teaching Irish and history in 1978 at the Holy Faith Convent in [[New Ross]], a girls' [[Catholic school]] run by the [[Sisters of the Holy Faith]].&lt;ref name="iehc2"/&gt; In 1980–81, she began a relationship with Richie Roche, a separated father of three who ran a pub in the town.&lt;ref name=irish-times-death-report/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheehan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iehc2_3"&gt;[1985] IEHC 1, secs.2,3&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Law and divorce around the world#Ireland|Divorce was illegal in Ireland]] at the time. The school principal warned her that parents had complained of the [[scandal (theology)#Catholicism|scandal]] and that she would be sacked if she continued;&lt;ref name="iehc2_3"/&gt; Flynn maintained that her [[private life]] was not the school's business.&lt;ref&gt;[1985] IEHC 1, secs.2,16,18&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1981 Flynn moved into Roche's house and in April 1982 announced her pregnancy to the new principal, Sister Mary Anna Power, who offered to arrange for her to give birth in London and put the child up for [[adoption]].&lt;ref name="Sheehan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iehc4"&gt;[1985] IEHC 1, sec.4&lt;/ref&gt; The same month the school manager said that she would be dismissed unless she changed her "lifestyle".&lt;ref name="iehc4"/&gt; Flynn gave birth in Ireland on 6 June 1982 and determined to raise the child with Roche.&lt;ref name="Sheehan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iehc6"&gt;[1985] IEHC 1, sec.6&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 August, the manager said that because of her "open rejection of the [[Norm (social)|norm]]s and behaviour and the ideals which [the] school exists to promote" she must resign or be dismissed.&lt;ref name="iehc7"&gt;[1985] IEHC 1, sec.7&lt;/ref&gt; She refused to resign and was dismissed on 22 August with effect from 20 November.&lt;ref name="iehc1"&gt;[1985] IEHC 1, sec.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court cases==
On 29 August 1982, Flynn told the principal she had contacted a solicitor and would contest the dismissal.&lt;ref name="iehc8"&gt;[1985] IEHC 1, sec.8&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1983, she took her case to the  [[Employment Appeal Tribunal]], alleging [[unfair dismissal]] under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, which prohibits [[pregnancy discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;[1985] IEHC 1, secs.1,10; {{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1977/act/10/section/6/enacted/en/html#sec6|title=Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, Section 6|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1984, the tribunal rejected her appeal.&lt;ref name="iehc1"/&gt; She appealed to the [[Circuit Court (Ireland)|Circuit Court]],&lt;ref name="iehc1"/&gt; where two parents of students testified at having made written complaints about Flynn to the school.&lt;ref name="Sheehan" /&gt; Judge Noel Ryan upheld the tribunal verdict, commenting that the nuns had been too lenient with Flynn.&lt;ref name="Sheehan" /&gt; On 8 March 1985 in the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]], [[Declan Costello]] upheld Ryan's verdict, on the basis that her dismissal was not due to her pregnancy ''per se'' but rather to her non-marital relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[1985] IEHC 1, secs.10,19&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn could not afford an appeal to the [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]].

The '''Essential National Industries (Employment) Decree 2011''' is a controversial [[decree]] issued by the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|military]]-led 'interim government' of the [[Fiji|Republic of Fiji]] in September 2011. It was followed a few days later by the '''Essential National Industries and Designated Corporations Regulations 2011'''.

==Background: the 2006 coup==
On 5 December 2006, Commodore [[Frank Bainimarama|Voreqe Bainimarama]], head of the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces]], overthrew democratically elected indigenous nationalist conservative [[Prime Minister of Fiji|Prime Minister]] [[Laisenia Qarase]], and took his place at the head of an "interim government," composed of both civilian and military ministers. Bainimarama stated that his main reasons for overthrowing the Qarase government were that it was corrupt, and that it was conducting racially discriminatory policies against the country's [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijian]] minority - namely its policy of "[[affirmative action]]" in favour of the [[Fijians|indigenous majority]]. In a speech publicly announcing the coup, he stated that Qarase's policies had "divided the nation now and will have very serious consequences to our future generations." He promised to amend the [[Elections in Fiji|race-based electoral rolls]], so as to "lead us into peace and prosperity and mend the ever widening racial divide that currently besets our [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] nation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiji.gov.fj/publish/page_8092.shtml "Commander RFMF - Public Declaration of Military Takeover"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915235544/http://www.fiji.gov.fj/publish/page_8092.shtml |date=15 September 2009 }}, Fiji government, 5 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, his government abolished the [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|Constitution]] and imposed strict censorship of the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/2341423/Bainimarama-says-he-is-the-future "Bainimarama says he is the future"], Michael Field, Stuff.co.nz, 17 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==The government and trade unions prior to the decree==
For several months, there had been considerable concern, expressed particularly by foreign trades union organisations, about restrictions on the rights of unions in Fiji, including acts of violence against unionists.

In February 2011, [[Amnesty International]] expressed concern about "the reported detention and beating of several trade unionists" in Fiji.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa18/001/2011/en/ "Fiji: Arbitrary detentions and beatings must stop"], Amnesty International, 24 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, the [[Trades Union Congress]] in the [[United Kingdom]] sent a protest to the Fiji High Commission in London, and issued the following statement:
:''"On 12 February, [[Felix Anthony]] was taken from his home by 3 uniformed military officers and subjected to threats whilst being driven around the back roads of [[Lautoka]] for some 2 hours. His family, including his children, were also threatened. On 18 February, Anthony and other union officials from the sugar industry were called to meet the Fijian Prime Minister at a sugar mill in [[Ba (town)|Ba]], on the western side of Fiji. The union representatives were subsequently assaulted by military officers while still at the mill, then taken to Namaka military barracks and subjected to further beatings. As they were released from the barracks, they were again threatened with further violence."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuc.org.uk/international/tuc-19339-f0.cfm "Fiji: End military intimidation and beatings of union officials"], Trades Union Congress, March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, [[Australia]]'s Transport Workers Union threatened to disrupt flights to Fiji unless [[Qantas]] took steps to protect its Fiji-based workers "from state-sanctioned violence." This followed claims by Fijian union members, particularly [[baggage handler]]s, that they had been punched, kicked and "hit with rubber belts" by soldiers questioning their loyalty to the government. The [[New Zealand Council of Trade Unions]] said it shared the Australian union's concerns, and issued the following statement: "We are very concerned about the physical intimidation and beatings of union officials in Fiji and also the decrees that remove work rights".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioaustralianews.net.au/stories/201107/3272421.htm "NZ unions consider Fiji bans"], ABC Radio Australia, 19 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]] condemned the police break-up of a meeting of the Fiji Trades Union Congress in [[Nadi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qld.asu.net.au/acturelease110813_fiji.pdf "More trouble in paradise: harassment of Fijian trade unions by military Government worsens"], ACTU media release, 13 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The same month, [[Brendan Barber]], General Secretary of the British TUC, wrote again to the Fiji High Commissioner in London, to express
:''"outrage over the arrest of Mr [[Daniel Urai Manufolau|Daniel Urai]], President, [[Fiji Trades Union Congress]], on 3 August 2011 in [[Suva]]. We note that the arrest of the FTUC President comes in the wake of the introduction of a new decree which further restricts the exercise of trade union and human rights in Fiji under the military regime. The arrests of trade unionists are a gross violation of the ILO [[International Labour Organization#1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work|Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work]]. Moreover, Fiji, which ratified Convention 98(1974) and Convention 87 (2002), is obliged to observe the workers' rights enshrined in them. Furthermore, these incidents constitute a serious impediment to Fiji's long overdue return to democracy, tarnish the image of your country and further aggravate the current difficulties, making social dialogue and reconciliation even more difficult."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuc.org.uk/international/tuc-19897-f0.cfm "Arrest of Mr Daniel Urai, President of Fiji Trades Union Congress"], Trades Union Congress, 4 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Zealand Council of Trade Unions]] and [[Amnesty International Aotearoa New Zealand]] held a protest following Urai's arrest for [[unlawful assembly]]. [[Helen Kelly (trade unionist)|Helen Kelly]], President of the CTU, stated that "earlier in the year, Felix Anthony of the FTUC was physically assaulted. The regime is perpetrating a deliberate attack on trade union rights by issuing decrees making it almost impossible for unions to function and removing internationally recognized civil rights of freedom of assembly and collective bargaining."&lt;ref&gt;[http://union.org.nz/news/2011/human-and-trade-union-rights-trial-fiji-today "Human and trade union rights on trial in Fiji today"], New Zealand Council of Trade Unions&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms of the decree==
The decree was officially issued by the [[President of Fiji]], [[Epeli Nailatikau]], whose role as head of State is an essentially ceremonial one. Its main stated objective is to "ensure the present and continued viability and sustainability of essential national industries for the benefit of Fiji".

Its terms are as follows:
* All existing [[trade union]]s must re-register in order to continue their activities (art.6);
* "All existing collective agreements" between employees and their employers are voided 60 days after the commencement of the decree (art.8);
* Elections of trade union representatives are subject to government approval (art.10);
* An employer may appeal to the government to cancel a representative's election if he or she at any time has "reliable objective information and evidence" that "at least 35% of workers" no longer support that representative (art.15); this enables the employer to cancel any "existing or current collective agreement" (art.17);
* "If an employer has suffered operating losses for two consecutive fiscal years, or two years of actual or expected operating losses in a three year period, it shall have the immediate right to renegotiate all its existing collective agreements". If no agreement can be reached with employees, the employer then sends a proposal to the government, which may approve it as binding upon employees, replacing any necessity for an agreement (art.23);
* Within "designated corporations", employees have no entitlement to [[overtime pay]] on Saturdays, Sundays or public holidays, unless granted by the employer (art.24);
* Art.24 also abolishes the Wages Council's jurisdiction over "any 'designated corporation' or essential national industry";
* "Disputes over discipline and discharge" are to be settled within the company, or by the government if ultimately unresolved, with no recourse to any court of law or any judicial institution (art.26);
* "No job actions, strikes, [[sickout|sick out]]s, slowdowns or other financially or operationally harmful activities shall be permitted at any time for any reason". Strikes are permitted only if employees have been negotiating unsuccessfully for at least three years for a collective agreement with their employer, and if they thereupon provide twenty-eight days' advance notice of the strike to their employer and to the government, and if the government approves the requested strike. The employer may then [[lock out]] any striking workers and "unilaterally impose terms and conditions of employment". Any worker taking part in an unauthorised strike may face a sentence of up to five years' imprisonment, combined with a fine of up to [[Fijian dollar|$]]50,000. The government may order the end of any strike (or lockout) in "any essential national industry" at any time (art.27);
* The decree prevails over any inconsistency with any existing law (art.28);
* No court of law, tribunal or commission has any jurisdiction to examine the legality or validity of the decree or of any decision made by the government or by any employer in application thereof (art.30).

==Terms of the regulations==
The Essential National Industries and Designated Corporations Regulations 2011 were issued by Commodore Bainimarama on 8 September "in exercise of the powers vested in me by section 31" of the Decree, to come into force the following day. They provided a list of the country's "essential national industries", as determined by Bainimarama. They are: the [[Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group]], the [[Bank of Baroda]], the [[Bank South Pacific]], the [[Westpac Banking Corporation]], the [[Fiji Revenue &amp; Customs Authority]], [[Fiji International Telecommunications]], [[Telecom Fiji]], the [[Fiji Broadcasting Corporation]], [[Air Pacific]], the [[Fiji Electricity Authority]], and the [[Water Authority of Fiji]].

==Rationale and reactions==

===Government and Fiji press===
Attorney General [[Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum]] played down the idea that there was anything exceptional about the Decree, during a press conference prior to its finalisation. He argued that "some countries restrict any strikes in essential services", and that "the principle of essential services is not anything new". In response to union reactions, he argued that the decree would actually preserve jobs: "We have found in companies that are financially unstable that if certain steps aren’t taken, they could close down therefore there’ll be job losses. Unionists that are not employees don’t have a particular self interest in preserving or maintaining the life of the company. You have to maintain the life of the company to make sure jobs are secure".&lt;ref name="face/off"&gt;[http://www.islandsbusiness.com/fiji_business/index_dynamic/containerNameToReplace=MiddleMiddle/focusModuleID=19861/overideSkinName=issueArticle-full.tpl "Union/govt face off: Decree deepens division"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115161807/http://www.islandsbusiness.com/fiji_business/index_dynamic/containerNameToReplace%3DMiddleMiddle/focusModuleID%3D19861/overideSkinName%3DissueArticle-full.tpl |date=15 November 2011 }}, ''[[Islands Business]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Fiji Times]]'', subject to government censorship, reported simply that "[t]he terms of the Essential National Industries (Employment) Decree 2011 [...] will govern the labour laws of the declared enterprises, ensuring the viability and sustainability of the industries while protecting fundamental workers' rights". It quoted Sayed-Khaiyum's statement that "[t]he Government takes providing for and protecting workers' rights very seriously".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=180268 "Essential industries"], ''Fiji Times'', 11 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Fiji Sun]]'' published an explanatory article by the Ministry of Information, including a list of "frequently asked questions" to reassure readers. To the question "Does the decree remove workers’ right to strike, as some have claimed?", the answer provided is: "No. The decree upholds the fundamental principle that workers may strike. Just as many other countries do, it makes it subject to certain conditions, including providing employees with a vote in favour or against it." And to the question "Are employers allowed to impose terms and conditions on workers?", the answer given is: "A due process must be followed as set out in the decree, involving good faith negotiations for at least 60 days in the case of a replacement agreement. Only after that would an employer have the right to implement new terms and conditions. Employees would have the right to appeal to the Minister for a review of the new terms."&lt;br&gt;
The final question is "What is your response to the claim that the Government has wiped out decades of advances for its workers?", with the government responding:
:''"In support of the great strides Fijian workers have made in recent time, the Fijian Government’s labour and employment protection benefits are responsible, comprehensive and genuine. The Fijian Government takes seriously the need to balance the well-being of Fiji’s economy and its ability to provide jobs with the intent to improve the quality of life for all Fijians and, importantly, to uphold justice and promote fundamental workers’ rights.''
:''We do not believe these are mutually exclusive goals. We continue to strive to ensure our body of employment and labour laws uphold our duty and commitment to the Fijian people. Meanwhile, trade unions cannot be allowed to hold essential industries ransom by blocking changes to terms and conditions and taking damaging strike action with impunity."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijisun.com.fj/main_page/view.asp?id=61880 "What work laws mean"], article by the Ministry of Information in the ''Fiji Sun'', 14 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
No public protests or demonstrations are allowed in Fiji, but the [[Fiji Trades Union Congress]] issued a statement saying the Decree "offers major weapons to the employers to utilise against unions [...] It outlaws professional trade unionists, eliminates existing collective agreements, promotes a biased system of non-professional bargaining agents to represent workers, severely restricts industrial action, strengthens sanctions against legally striking workers and bans overtime payments and other allowances for workers in 24-hour operations". [[Attar Singh]], General Secretary for the [[Fiji Islands Council of Trade Unions]], said: "We have never seen anything worse than this decree. It is without doubt designed to decimate unions [...] by giving [employers] an unfair advantage over workers and unions".&lt;ref name="face/off" /&gt;

[[Amnesty International]] condemned the Decree as "a breathtaking abuse of fundamental rights [which] takes away nearly all collective bargaining rights in essential companies [and] virtually abolishes the right to strike".&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/pacbeat/stories/201109/s3316421.htm "11 companies declared essential by Fiji military regime"], ABC Radio Australia, 13 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It added: "Fundamental [[Human rights in Fiji|human rights]] are at stake, including the right to [[freedom of association]] and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], and the right to organise. Amnesty International stands steadfast in solidarity with workers in Fiji and the Fiji labour movement in their struggle to defend their rights."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa18/003/2011/en/ "Warning on Fiji government plan to severely restrict workers' rights"] , Amnesty International, 8 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Juan Somavia]], Director-General of the [[International Labour Organization]], stated:
:''"By going ahead with this Decree the Government has demonstrated the same lack of concern for the views of the international community as it has for the rights and aspirations of its own people. What is really essential for Fiji is that it change course now. That means reversing this and other restrictive labour decrees, a return to dialogue with trade unions and employers, an end to assaults on and harassment of trade unionists, and the immediate restoration of basic civil liberties."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilocarib.org.tt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1613:statement-on-fiji-by-ilo-director-general-juan-somavia&amp;catid=117:news-room&amp;Itemid=1035 "Statement on Fiji, by ILO Director-General Juan Somavia"], International Labour Organization, 13 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahendra Chaudhry]], leader of the [[Fiji Labour Party]], published a statement in July which did not specifically mention the Decree but addressed the government's broader policies in relation to trade unions:
:''"Fiji has ratified [...] [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] Conventions and must act in conformity with them. It cannot promulgate laws that contravene these Conventions or go around physically bashing union leaders. [...] Both the local unions and the international trade union movement have written to the government protesting against its anti-union policies and decrees. There has been no response. How does one take up issues with a government that does not respond to concerns raised with it, does not consult and thinks it can govern through arbitrary decisions, suppression of rights, intimidation and physical violence [...]?"''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flp.org.fj/n110723.htm "On trade unions and their rights"], Mahendra Chaudhry, Fiji Labour Party, 23 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shaista Shameem]], former director of the [[Fiji Human Rights Commission]], who had at first supported the 2006 military coup, stated that "many rights have been completely diminished or even removed" by the Decree. She added that it showed the Bainimarama government was no longer interested in consensual policy-making.&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt;

In October, during the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] in Australia, [[Ged Kearney]], President of the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]], said that, within the Commonwealth, the worst abuses of workers' rights were currently occurring in Fiji and in [[Swaziland]]. The Commonwealth Trade Union Group called for condemnation of the Decree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/actu-slams-lack-of-workers-rights/story-e6frf7jx-1226177402380 "ACTU slams lack of workers' rights"], AAP, 26 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Sayed-Khaiyum dismissed the criticism, saying much of it was based on "misinformation", and on people trying to misrepresent the situation in Fiji.&lt;ref&gt;[http://australianetworknews.com/stories/201109/3317844.htm "Fiji employment decree comes under fire"], Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 13 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath: Arrest of trade union leaders==
In late October and early November, Fijian Trades Union Congress leaders Daniel Urai and Felix Anthony were both separately arrested, and reportedly held without charge. The Australian government said the Fiji authorities were "targeting and intimidating trade unionists".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-05/union-mulls-fiji-travel-boycott-after-arrests/3637344 "Union mulls Fiji travel boycott after arrests"], Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 5 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Farm Debt Mediation Act''''' (S.C. 1997, c. 21) ("FDMA") is an act of the [[Parliament of Canada]] that enables a debt advisory service to insolvent farmers by [[Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada]], as well as certain protective provisions available to help facilitate [[mediation]] with creditors while allowing such farmers to continue their operations.

==Background==
While the ''[[Farm Debt Review Act]]'' already allowed protection for farmers in financial difficulty, it was seen as being too broad in scope, where even [[hobby farmer]]s could receive protection from creditors.&lt;ref name="Howard2016"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.coxandpalmerlaw.com/en/home/publications/tread-carefully-enforcement-of-farming-assets.aspx|title= Tread Carefully – Enforcement of Farming Assets|last= Howard|first= Ben|date= 23 May 2016|website= coxandpalmerlaw.com|publisher= Cox &amp; Palmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act's structure of exercising authority through a network of appointed boards was also viewed as being too decentralized. In April 1997, the FDMA received  [[Royal Assent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Farm Debt Mediation Act|abbr =S.C.|year =1997|chapter = 21|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1997v02cana#page/n127/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was brought into force in April 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 15 April 1998|title= SI 98/52: Order Fixing April 1, 1998 as the Date of the Coming into Force of the Farm Debt Mediation Act|url= http://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/1998/1998-04-15/pdf/g2-13208.pdf|journal= [[Canada Gazette]], Part II|volume= 132|issue= 8|page= 1379 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Framework==
===Scope===
In contrast to the FDRA, a farmer is defined as being any individual or entity "that is engaged in farming for commercial purposes and that meets any prescribed criteria,"&lt;ref name="FDMA2"&gt;FDMA, s. 2&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|no prescribed criteria are currently in effect}} and only insolvent farmers may apply for a financial review and mediation with all of the farmer's creditors (either with or without a [[stay of proceedings]]).&lt;ref&gt;FDMA, s. 5&lt;/ref&gt; As in the FDRA, "farming" included the production or raising of any animal or thing on a farm,&lt;ref name="FDMA2"/&gt; and it was declared that:

{{cquote|
'''6''' Only farmers

:(a) who are for any reason unable to meet their obligations as they generally become due,
:(b) who have ceased paying their current obligations in the ordinary course of business as they generally become due, or
:(c) the aggregate of whose property is not, at a fair valuation, sufficient, or if disposed of at a fairly conducted sale under legal process would not be sufficient, to enable payment of all their obligations, due and accruing due

are eligible to apply under section 5.&lt;ref&gt;FDMA, s. 6&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A stay of proceedings under the FDMA operates "notwithstanding any law",&lt;ref&gt;FDMA, s. 12&lt;/ref&gt; which has been interpreted to mean that it also suspends of petition of bankruptcy under the ''[[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]''.&lt;ref name="Howard2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Re North 40 Farms|link=|year=1999|court=mbqb|num=14089|format=canlii|parallelcite= |date=1999-03-04|courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administration===
In place of the former Farm Debt Review Boards, administrators are either appointed or engaged by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada to administer the Act,{{efn|there are currently no administrators that are engaged at this time, who are not part of the [[Public Service of Canada]]}} and they can enter into agreements to engage [[mediation|mediator]]s and [[expert]]s. Where an administrator receives an application from an insolvent farmer, they must inform all the farmer's secured and unsecured creditors and (where the Minister is [[guarantor]] of any debt) the Minister, issue a stay of proceedings for 30 days where it has been requested, and (after a preliminary review of the farmer’s financial affairs) make a determination as to whether the farmer is actually eligible to make such an application.&lt;ref&gt;FDMA, s. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In connection with the application:

:* the administrator or appropriate expert will undertake "a detailed review of the farmer's financial affairs", which must include an inventory and financial statements of the farming operation, and may recommend that specified parties participate in a mediation, as well as the "preparation of recovery plans{{efn|unless the administrator agrees to accept the farmer's choice of person for the role}} for the purpose of reaching financial arrangements with creditors and the Minister."&lt;ref&gt;FDMA, s. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
:* when the results of a review has been finalized in a report, the administrator must appoint a mediator and inform the farmer and creditors of the appointment&lt;ref&gt;FDMA, s. 10&lt;/ref&gt;
::* in the case of a mediation arising under s. 5(1)(a) (which includes a stay of proceedings), the mediation and stay terminate when the administrator determines that either the farmer or the majority of the creditors refuse to participate in the mediation or refused to continue to participate in good faith, the mediation will not result in reaching an arrangement between the farmer and a majority of creditors, the farmer has contravened any directive issued concerning the guardianship of the assets, or where the farmer has jeopardized the assets or obstructed the guardian in the performance of his duties.&lt;ref&gt;FDMA, ss. 11(1), 14(2), 14(4)&lt;/ref&gt;
::* in the case of a mediation arising under s. 5(1)(b) (which concerns only financial review and mediation), the mediation terminates when the administrator determines that either the farmer or the majority of the creditors refuse to participate in the mediation or refused to continue to participate in good faith, or the mediation will not result in reaching an arrangement between the farmer and a majority of creditors&lt;ref&gt;FDMA, s. 11(2)&lt;/ref&gt;
:* a stay of proceedings can be extended for a further three 30-day periods, and must be extended to the date of an appeal board's decision concerning an administrator's decision not to extend the stay (when the stay is scheduled to expire in the interim)&lt;ref&gt;FDMA, ss. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;
::* when a stay has been issued, the administrator must appoint a guardian over the farmer's assets (who may be the farmer), and the administrator may issue directives to such guardian&lt;ref&gt;FDMA, s. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
:* the Minister may appoint one or more appeal boards to hear appeals from an administor's decisions concerning a farmer's eligibility to make an application, or relating to an extension or termination of a stay of proceedings&lt;ref&gt;FDMA, s. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
:* a farmer shall not make a new application under the Act during the two years following the previous one&lt;ref&gt;FDMA, s. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enforcement===
Before enforcing any remedy against a farmer's property, or commencing any proceedings "for the recovery of a debt, the realization of any security or the taking of any property of a farmer," a secured creditor must give written notice of intention to do so, together with advising the farmer of his right to apply for a stay of proceedings, and copies must be given to the farmer and administrator at least 15 [[business days]] before doing so.&lt;ref&gt;FDMA, s. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The holder of a [[guarantee]] is not considered a secured creditor nor obliged to give a FDMA notice, unless that guarantor is a farmer and has provided collateral security in support of the guarantee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= CIBC v. Verbrugshe|vol= (2006)|reporter= Carswell|opinion= 3502, 4461|pinpoint= |court= Ont.S.C.J.|date= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enforcement involves a complex interplay between the FDMA and other relevant statutes. In Manitoba, the process is characterized thus:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tmlawyers.com/farm-protection-in-manitoba-saf-harbour-or-a-trap-for-the-unwary/|title= Farm Protection In Manitoba – Safe Harbour Or A Trap For The Unwary?|last= Jackson|first= David R.M.|date= 18 April 2013|location= Winnipeg|publisher= Taylor McCaffrey LLP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Initial notices of intention to realize on security must be given under the ''[[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act|abbr =R.S.C.|year =1985|chapter =B-3|section = 244|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/section-244.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; FDMA and the ''Personal Property Security Act''{{efn|with respect to the seizure of growing crops&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =The Personal Property Security Act|abbr =C.C.S.M.|year =|chapter =P.35|section = 37|subsection= 7|link= http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/ccsm/p035e.php#37(7)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} There is debate as to whether these notices should be given concurrently or consecutively.
#After the stay of proceedings under the FDMA has ceased to have effect, the farmer's real property may not be seized unless a separate mediation process has been completed and leave granted by the [[Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba|Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench]] under the ''Family Farm Protection Act''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =The Family Farm Protection Act|abbr =C.C.S.M.|year =|chapter =F15|link= http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/ccsm/f015e.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FFPA process cannot commence until the FDMA stay of proceedings has terminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=M &amp; D Farm Ltd v Manitoba Agricultural Credit Corp|link=|year=1999|court=scc|num=648|format=canlii|pinpoint= par. 29-31|parallelcite=[1999] 2 SCR 961|date=1999-09-02|courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Where farm machinery and farm equipment have been purchased from a dealer in the province, the ''Farm Machinery and Equipment Act'' provides that it cannot be repossessed by a lienholder without the approval of the [[Manitoba Farm Industry Board]]. Following [[repossession]], the lienholder must give notice to the farmer of his action, and must hold the assets for 10 [[business day|working days]], in order for the purchaser to be able to settle the amount of the payments in default, together with accrued interest and other related costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =The Farm Machinery and Equipment Act|abbr =C.C.S.M.|year =|chapter =F40+section=38-39|link= http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/ccsm/f040e.php#38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#A farmer cannot be petitioned into bankruptcy or have an [[receivership|interim receiver]] appointed with respect to his assets,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act|abbr =R.S.C.|year =1985|chapter =B-3|section = 48|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/section-48.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; but may opt to make an assignment in bankruptcy.

==Impact==
The Act's mandatory requirements have been strictly interpreted by the courts. For example, it has been held that a farmer cannot waive the secured creditor's obligation to given notice of intention to enforce security, even where it has been included in a mediation agreement.&lt;ref name="Howard2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Intec Holdings Ltd v Grisnich|link=|year=2003|court=abqb|num=993|pinpoint=par. 68|parallelcite=[2004] 10 WWR 452|date=2003-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a stay cannot affect the appointment already in effect of an interim receiver for the purposes of preserving the estate of a bankrupt for the benefit of creditors, as it is not a proceeding for the recovery of a debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Jacob's Hold Inc v Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce|link=|year=2000|court=onsc|num=22730|format=canlii|parallelcite=52 OR (3d) 776|date=2000-09-14|courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Act covers only farming operations that are operated "with a commercial purpose", the courts have devised a list of factors to consider whether such is the case:&lt;ref name="Howard2016"/&gt;

:* the debtor has dedicated most his/her land to a farming activity;
:* the farming activity is entirely the result of the debtor’s efforts;
:* the debtor has claimed farming losses;
:* the debtor has engaged in farming activities both before and since obtaining the debt; and
:* the debtor intends to make an eventual profit from the farming activity.

The '''Ley Federal de Protección de Datos Personales en Posesión de los Particulares''' ('''Federal Law on Protection of Personal Data Held by Individuals'''; '''LFPDPPP'''), is a [[law of Mexico]], approved by the [[Congress of the Union|Mexican Congress]] on April 27, 2010. The law aims to regulate the right to informational self-determination. The law was published on July 5, 2010 in the Official Gazette and entered into force on July 6, 2010. Its provisions apply to all natural or legal persons who carry out the processing of personal data in the applicable exercise of their activities. Companies such as banks, insurance companies, hospitals, schools, telecommunications companies, religious organizations, and professionals such as lawyers, doctors, and others, are required to comply with the provisions of this law.

Personal data, according to Article 3 Section V of the Act, is any information that could identify a person.

==Regulatory background in Mexico==
Before issuing the LFPDPPP in Mexico this right was expressly recognized only by the Federal Law of Transparency and Access to Public Government Information (applying to the public sector) and in the Law on Protection of Personal Data in the State of [[Colima]] (public and private).

Due to the regulatory landscape needed to meet international commitments, it was considered necessary to issue a law on the matter, so there would be a backup in the information.

==Constitutional reforms of personal data==

===Chapter III, of the rights of the holders of personal data===
Law takes the contents of the second paragraph of Article 16 of the Constitution and grant holders called "ARCO rights" whose acronym corresponds to:

Access : holders can know if their data is being processed.
Correction : the right to request that their data be modified.
Cancellation : holders may request that their data be canceled from the database for good cause.
Opposition : the right of individuals to prevent treat your information.
Chapter IV Exercise of the rights of access, rectification, cancellation and opposition

Those responsible are obliged to process the requests for access, rectification, cancellation and opposition that made the headlines, for which purpose shall appoint a person or creating a department of personal data, which is responsible for responding to requests within the time prescribed by law. In this chapter the ways in which it can be fulfilled with these rights are also noted, and the reasons why some of them may be denied.

===Chapter V, the transfer of data===
When the responsible party intends to transfer the data holder shall inform this fact in its privacy notice, requiring the consent of the holder, unless you apply any of the exceptions contemplated by this chapter.

===The amendment of Article 6 of the Constitution===
The first record is in the reform in 2007 to Article 6 of the Constitution, in which a second paragraph is adicionaba this paragraph, laying the groundwork regarding the right to information (transparency), including the protection of personal data from public institutions, recognizing the rights of access and rectification. 3

===The amendment to article 16 of the Constitution===
In this reform 4 a second paragraph to Article 16 is added, and states that everyone has the right to protection of personal data and to exercise the rights called "ARC" (access, rectification, cancellation and opposition).

The Constitution also states that right may only be limited for reasons of national security provisions of public policy, public security or public health or to protect the rights of others. The LFPDPPP meanwhile, collects these assumptions within Article 4.

===The amendment to article 73 of the Constitution===
In this reform in May it empowered the Congress to legislate on the protection of personal data held by individuals, through the addition of the XXIX-O moiety. The justification for granting that power to the Federal Legislature was that personal data are used in various commercial transactions and trade is regulated at the federal level.

==Contents of the Federal Data Protection Act==

===Chapter I, General Provisions===
Articles 1 and 2 of the LFPDPPP point out that the objectives of it are ensuring the privacy of persons (natural) and their right to informational self-determination, and that its provisions apply to non-automated or automated processing of personal information perform (the "Responsible") individuals or companies, with certain exceptions (personal purposes and carrying on the credit information). In this chapter the central terms of this regulation, among which are fundamental concepts of sensitive personal data, head, head, manager, third and treatment are defined.

===Model legislation on the protection of personal data===
Globally it recognized the existence of two models in terms of protection of personal data : general and sector.

The general model is adopted by most countries, especially the European Union and among its features are:

There is only one regulatory body in the field and an authority responsible for compliance.
Provided the consent of the holders for the processing of data is required.
Transfers to countries without an adequate level of protection is prohibited.
For its part, the industry model is applied by the United States and has the following characteristics:

There is no single legal instrument governing the matter, the various agencies can issue regulations as they deem appropriate for their industry.
Various authorities, within the scope of their competence. They are responsible for ensuring the protection of this right.
The consent of the holders for the treatment of the data is presumed unless they express their refusal.
This scheme operates under self-regulation.

===Chapter II, of the principles of personal data protection===
The law takes the general model the principles of legality, consent, information, quality, purpose, loyalty, proportionality and accountability.

Are important principles of consent, information and purpose, under which managers can only make the processing of personal data if owning them give their consent for the purposes outlined in the privacy notice .

===Chapter VI of the authorities===
The Act states that the IFAI (called Federal Institute of Access to Information and Data Protection from the reform of July 5, 2010 6 ) will be the authority to monitor and verify compliance with the Personal Data Act and as procedures to process rights protection, verification and sanction (Chapters VII, VIII and IX). In addition, the law states that the Ministries may issue provisions in this field, giving special powers to the Ministry of Economy .

===Chapter VII, the procedure of protection of rights===
This procedure begins with an application by the owner of the data before the IFAI, if it considers that the charge unreasonably denied access, rectification, cancellation and opposition of their data. The section in question states the procedure and time limits in which this procedure will be the grounds for inadmissibility and dismissal as well as the appeal proceeding against the resolution issued by the Institute.

===Chapter X, Violations and Sanctions===
Within this chapter catalog of violations of the law and their correlative sanctions lists. The law provides for such sanctions, fines ranging from 100 to 320.000 days of minimum wage in the Federal District, which may be increased for repeated infringement, and will double when violations are related to the processing of sensitive personal data. In accordance with the minimum wage in Mexico City in 2013, the fines range from $6476.00 (minimum) and $20'723,200.00 (maximum). 7

===Chapter VIII, the verification procedure===
This procedure will begin when those responsible fail to comply with the resolutions issued by the IFAI, or when the authority presumed the existence of some sort of default. The form and deadlines to substantiate this procedure is regulated by the rules of procedure.

===Chapter IX, the procedure for imposing sanctions===
IFAI is empowered to initiate disciplinary proceedings in case, derived from processing of rights protection procedures and verification has detected a breach of the principles and provisions of the Act. The form and deadlines to substantiate This procedure is governed by the rules of procedure.

===Chapter XI Offences in Respect of Personal Data Processing Drug===
The law provides for prison sentences ranging from three months to five years in prison, same may also be doubled when behaviors are related to sensitive personal data.

==Privacy notice==
Privacy notice is a text that will explain to the data owner how the data will be used, and is generated in print or electronic (appears as a link on a Web page). The law and its regulations mentioned in several articles that will shape this privacy notice. Additionally, on January 17, 2013 the Ministry of Economy published in the Official Journal in August Federation guidelines for generating the Privacy Notice, in order to minimize the need for them to have recourse to private companies for advice in its creation. The publication of three forms differ Privacy Notice: Integral, Simplified and Short, depending on your application.

==Conclusions==
The Personal Data Act passed by the Mexican Congress includes elements of general and sectoral models, and stands as a necessary policy instrument to protect the privacy of individuals with regard to treatment that they may give other individuals regarding their personal information. Of its provisions it shows that the data of individuals are protected from all angles, under which the information provided by individuals in their capacity as clients in hiring all kinds of services or as workers in their places of work, among many other aspects, are protected by the LFPDPPP.

The '''Harare Commonwealth Declaration''' was a declaration of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], setting out the Commonwealth's core principles and values, detailing the Commonwealth's [[Commonwealth of Nations membership criteria|membership criteria]], and redefining and reinforcing its purpose. The Declaration was issued in [[Harare]], [[Zimbabwe]], on 20 October 1991, during the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1991|twelfth]] [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]].&lt;ref name="Harare Declaration text"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Templates/Internal.asp?NodeID=34457 |date=20 October 1991 |title=Harare Commonwealth Declaration |accessdate=25 July 2007 |publisher=[[Commonwealth Secretariat]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040207030954/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Templates/Internal.asp?NodeID=34457 |archivedate=7 February 2004 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It reaffirmed the political principles laid out in the [[Singapore Declaration]] of twenty years before, and (along with the Singapore Declaration) is considered one of the two most important documents to the Commonwealth's [[uncodified constitution|uncodified]] constitution.&lt;ref name="Key Declarations"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/20723/key_declarations/ |title=Key Declarations |accessdate=25 July 2007 |publisher=[[Commonwealth Secretariat]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819010922/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/20723/key_declarations/ |archivedate=19 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Singapore Declaration had committed the Commonwealth to several principles in 1971: [[world peace]] and support for the United Nations; [[individual liberty]] and [[egalitarianism]]; opposition to racism; opposition to [[colonialism]]; the eradication of poverty, ignorance, disease, and [[economic inequality]]; [[free trade]]; institutional co-operation; multilateralism; and the rejection of international [[coercion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/20723/32987/singapore_declaration_of_commonwealth_principles/ |date=22 January 1971 |title=Singapore Declaration of Commonwealth Principles 1971 |accessdate=25 July 2007 |publisher=[[Commonwealth Secretariat]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511174313/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/20723/32987/singapore_declaration_of_commonwealth_principles/ |archivedate=11 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Harare Declaration reaffirmed all these except the last. It also emphasised in particular a few of the principles and values mentioned in Singapore as integral to the Commonwealth project:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* We believe that international peace and order, global economic development and the rule of international law are essential to the security and prosperity of mankind;
* We believe in the liberty of the individual under the law, in equal rights for all citizens regardless of gender, race, colour, creed or political belief, and in the individual's inalienable right to participate by means of free and democratic political processes in framing the society in which he or she lives;
* We recognise racial prejudice and intolerance as a dangerous sickness and a threat to healthy development, and racial discrimination as an unmitigated evil;
* We oppose all forms of racial oppression, and we are committed to the principles of human dignity and equality;
* We recognise the importance and urgency of economic and social development to satisfy the basic needs and aspirations of the vast majority of the peoples of the world, and seek the progressive removal of the wide disparities in living standards amongst our members.&lt;ref name="Harare Declaration text" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At Harare, the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] dedicated themselves to applying these principles to then-current issues, such as the end of the [[Cold War]], the near-completion of [[decolonization|decolonisation]], and the impending end of the [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid government in South Africa]].&lt;ref name="Harare Declaration text" /&gt; In this sense, it is considered to have set the Commonwealth on a new course, distinct from that followed before.&lt;ref name="Key Declarations" /&gt;

The next part of the declaration details the purpose of the Commonwealth, and the activities in which it ought to engage to further the values expounded.&lt;ref name="Harare Declaration text" /&gt;

Critical to the document is the removal of a reference to the opposition to international [[coercion]], which had been included in the Singapore Declaration.&lt;ref name="Blair's Britain"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Williams |first=Paul D. |date=July 2005 |title=Blair's Britain and the Commonwealth |journal=[[The Round Table Journal|The Round Table]] |volume=94 |issue=380 |pages=381–391 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1080/00358530500174960 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The implication at Singapore was that not even the Commonwealth itself had any right to enforce its other core values, as they could only be enforced by using coercive powers.&lt;ref name="Blair's Britain" /&gt; This apparent conflict was resolved at Harare, and further clarified by the [[Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme]], which clearly mandated the Commonwealth to concern itself with its members' internal situations.&lt;ref name="Blair's Britain" /&gt;

The system is made up of a central controller and up to 8 input modules and 16 output modules. Each input module can have 16 digital (on/off) inputs and each output module 8 digital (on/off) outputs, resulting in a total of 128 input and 128 outputs per controller.

== Module control protocol ==

[[File:IHC input module protocol, input 2 on.png|thumbnail|IHC input module protocol, input 2 on]]

The central controller has one point-to-point data communication wire connected to each module. The protocol between the central controller and the modules uses a 5V pulse width encoding as follows:
* A header that is 4100µs high and 300µs low
* One pulse per I/O port, i.e. 16 pulses for input modules and 8 pulses for output modules
* One addition parity pulse; an even number of pulses is 0 parity and odd number pulses is 1 parity
* The pulse width is 600µs
* A 0 (input or output off, or even parity) is encoded as 300µs high and 300µs low
* A 1 (input or output on, or odd parity) is encoded as 150µs high and 450µs low

The above signal constantly repeats.

The '''International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1992''', often referred to as '''FUND92''' or '''FUND''', is an international maritime treaty, administered by the [[International Maritime Organization]]. The original FUND convention in 1969 was drawn up as an enhancement to CLC meant on one hand to relieve shipowners from unfair liabilities due to unforeseeable circumstances and on the other hand remove liability caps that some member states thought were too low.&lt;ref name="fund"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imo.org/Conventions/contents.asp?doc_id=661&amp;topic_id=256 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090707130551/http://www.imo.org/Conventions/contents.asp?topic_id=256&amp;doc_id=661 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-07-07 |title=International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage (FUND), 1971 |publisher=International Maritime Organization |date= |accessdate=2010-07-02}} &lt;/ref&gt; The fund is obliged to pay victims of pollution when damages exceed the shipowner's liability, when there is no liable shipowner, or when the shipowner is unable to pay its liability.&lt;ref name="fund"/&gt; The fund is also required to "indemnify the shipowner or his insurer" in spills where a ship is in full compliance with international conventions, and no wilful misconduct caused the spill.&lt;ref name="fund"/&gt;

The '''International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance'''(also called the "Necessary and Proportionate Principles" or just "the Principles") is a document which attempts to "clarify how international human rights law applies in the current [[digital environment]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance], at Preface, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
Communications Surveillance([[Mass Surveillance]] of [[Communication]]) conflicts with a number of [[International Human Rights]], mainly that of [[Right to Privacy|Privacy]]. As a result,Communications Surveillance may only occur when prescribed by [[law]] necessary to achieve legitimate aim, and proportionate to the aim used.&lt;ref&gt;Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 29; General Comment No. 27, Adopted by The Human Rights Committee Under Article 40, Paragraph 4, Of The International Covenant On Civil And Political Rights, CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.9, November 2, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism," 2009, A/HRC/17/34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank La Rue, "Report of the Special Rapporteur to the Human Rights Council on the implications of States' surveillance of communications on the exercise of the human rights to privacy and to freedom of opinion and expression", 2013, A.HRC.23.40 EN&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The document consists of 13 principles developed to provide society groups, [[industry]], [[governments]], and others with a framework to assess whether current and proposed surveillance laws or statutes conflict with International Human Rights law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengovguide.com/standards-and-guidance/international-principles-application-human-rights-communications-surveillance|Open Government Guide on the International Principles on the application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The inception of the principles occurred as a result of a meeting between over 40 experts in [[privacy]] and [[security]] in [[Brussels]], October 2012. After the initial consultation, a second meeting in [[Rio de Janeiro]] took place in December 2012 with the participation of the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]].&lt;ref&gt;UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression, Frank La Rue, A/HRC/23/40, at para 10&lt;/ref&gt; Global consultation followed via conference calls every month between January and May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.accessnow.org/blog/2013/09/22/surveillance-and-human-rights-principles-are-launched-at-the-24th-hrc&lt;/ref&gt;
The drafting process, led by [[Accessnow.org|Access Now]], [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] and [[Privacy International]], along with several [[Non-Governmental Organisations|NGO's]], Criminal [[Lawyers]], Human rights advocates and privacy advocates were finalized and published for the first time on 10 July 2013 online at www.necessaryandproportionate.org.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Privacy/ElectronicFrontierFoundation.pdf EFF, Necessary and Proportionate], article 19, May 2014 at 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013 at the 24th session of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]] in [[Geneva]], they were launched officially.

The principles have now been adopted globally by more than 400 [[organizations]]. The [[globe|global]] adoption necessitated a number of primarily superficial textual changes in the [[language]] of the document for the purposes of [[translation]]. This occurred between March and May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance], at Insert, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect and intention of the principles remained the same, and the final and authoritative version of the document was then launched in May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance] at Insert, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political Support Prior to the Publication of the Principles==

The initial release followed a report from the United Nations Special Rapporteur on [[Freedom of Expression]] and [[Opinion]] in April 2013, which highlights the widespread practice of states surveying communications, stating that such surveillance severely undermines citizens' ability to enjoy a private life, freely express themselves and enjoy their other fundamental human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session23/A.HRC.23.40_EN.pdf Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression] 10 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013 the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]], emphasized the importance of applying human right standards and democratic safeguards to surveillance and law enforcement activities:"While concerns about national security and criminal activity may justify the exceptional and narrowly-tailored use of surveillance programmes, surveillance without adequate safeguards to protect the right to privacy actually risk impacting negatively on the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13534&amp;  Mass surveillance:Pillay urges respect for right to privacy and protection of individuals revealing human rights violations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

The purpose of the principles was to provide civil society groups, [[Sovereign state|states]], the [[courts]], legislative and regulatory bodies, industry and others with a framework to evaluate whether current or proposed surveillance laws comply with International Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Privacy/ElectronicFrontierFoundation.pdf EFF, Necessary and Proportionate], article 19, May 2014 at 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The concern was that key protections to [[privacy]] had been eroded away with technological advancements, therefore needed robust support in some areas to raise international human rights to the standards which had developed in the pre-digital age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Privacy/ElectronicFrontierFoundation.pdf EFF, Necessary and Proportionate], article 19, May 2014 at 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Principles==

The following is a summary of the document containing the principles. All below is source from the actual document itself, except where noted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance], May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preamble===

The preamble of the document recognizes that Communications Surveillance interferes with the [[Right to privacy]], therefore can only be used when it is prescribed by law, necessary to achieve a legitimate aim, and proportionate to the aim pursued.&lt;ref&gt;Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 29; General Comment No. 27, Adopted by The Human Rights Committee Under Article 40, Paragraph 4, Of The International Covenant On Civil And Political Rights, CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.9, November 2, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism," 2009, A/HRC/17/34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank La Rue, "Report of the Special Rapporteur to the Human Rights Council on the implications of States' surveillance of communications on the exercise of the human rights to privacy and to freedom of opinion and expression", 2013, A.HRC.23.40 EN&lt;/ref&gt; The view of the document is that existing human rights law has not kept up with the progression of [[technology]]. The preamble states that the threat to these rights combined with the increase in popularity of using communications content and [[metadata]] that states are not placing "sufficient restrictions on how they can be subsequently used by States".&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles#preamble International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance], Preamble, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/12/2013-year-review-principled-fight-against-global-mass-surveillance |title=2013 Year in Review: A Principled Fight Against Global Mass Surveillance &amp;#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date=2013-12-30 |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scope of Application===

To get the correct scope and purpose of application for the document, it is required to be read and interpreted as part of a larger framework rather than as individual principles.
Application of this document is to apply both within states and extra territorially, regardless of purpose.

It is to apply for protection of the individual from the state, and also states there is an obligation of states to protect individuals from [[non-state actor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles#scope-of-application International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance], at Scope of Application, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The document states that unless the principles are applied this way, a State conducting Communications Surveillance may not meet International Human Rights obligations. The principles are stated to "articulate the duties and obligations of States when engaging in Communications Surveillance".&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles#scope-of-application International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance], at Scope of Application, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing Definitions and Technology===

This section of the document is dedicated to the interpretation of certain terms found throughout the document, and highlighting that some of the legal definitions used may not have effectively kept pace with technological change, and require reiteration. 
The principles state that the because of the increased ability of communications surveillance, the existing legal framework which currently distinguishes between 'content' and 'non-content' is no longer appropriate, and protection from all types of surveillance should be given a higher legal priority.

===The Principles===

====Legality====
Any limitation imposed on an International Human Rights must be prescribed by law. Sufficient notice should be given if a proposed law is going to limit one of these rights. The law should be clear, and given periodic review to ensure it remains effective given the speed of technological development.

====Legitimate Aim====
Communications surveillance should only be used by permitted [[State (polity)|state]] [[Authority|authorities]] where necessary in a [[democratic society]]. Any situation where discrimination arises should not be used.

====Necessity====
Surveillance laws should be limited to those which are necessary to achieve a legitimate aim, or where there are multiple means but Communications Surveillance is the least intrusive method on International Human Rights. The onus of establishing necessity should remain with the state&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles#the-principles International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance], at Principle of Necessity, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adequacy====
Any communications surveillance authorized by law must be appropriate for the legitimate aim it is fulfilling.

====Proportionality====
Communications Surveillance is regarded as a highly intrusive act, and therefore must consider the sensitivity and severity of the situation. The state should establish the following prior to conducting communications surveillance:
*There is a high chance of serious crime or specific threat
*There is a high degree of probability that relevant evidence will be obtained. 
*Other less invasive techniques have been exhausted, such that communications surveillance is the least intrusive method
*[[Information]] collected will be confined to only which is relevant
*Excess information obtained will be returned or destroyed
*The information accesses will be used by the specific authority for the purpose the authority was given
*The requested authority to use communications surveillance does not undermine the purpose of the right to privacy or other fundamental freedoms.

====Competent Judicial Authority====
The authority determining the validity of the communications surveillance must be independent of those conducting the surveillance, and be competent when making these decisions.

====Due Process====
That everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by a competent judicial authority. Due process can be used interchangeably with "[[procedural fairness]]" and "[[natural justice]]"&lt;ref&gt;European Convention for Human Rights, Article 6(1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The American Convention on Human Rights,Article 8&lt;/ref&gt;

====User Notification====
Those subjects of Communication Surveillance should be given the opportunity to challenge the decision when a decision authorizing Surveillance has been issued. The materials presented in support of the application should be available for those subjects. Delay in notification is acceptable where notification would frustrate the purpose of communication surveillance and authorization is granted by a competent judicial authority.

====Transparency====
Information about use and amount of Communication Surveillance should be available to those who request it. States should provide the requestor with information sufficient to ascertain the nature of the request and determine the size of both the request and those who will be affected by it. Records of requests for communications surveyed should also be published.

====Public Oversight====
States should establish an independent position to oversee the use of Communications Surveillance and to ensure transparency and accountability. The person(s) in this position would have sufficient authority to access all potentially relevant information, to assess whether the State is making legitimate use of its lawful capabilities, to evaluate whether the State has met its transparency obligations, and to make public determinations as to the lawfulness of those actions. The document in this instance makes reference to the United Kingdom's [[Interception of Communications Commissioner]] as an example of such an independent oversight mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iocco-uk.info/sections.asp?sectionID=2&amp;type=top Interception of Communications Commissioner's Office]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Integrity of communication and systems====
States should not require those service providers or software/hardware vendors to build surveillance/monitoring capability into their systems. People have a right to express themselves anonymously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session23/A.HRC.23.40_EN.pdf Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression] 10 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====Safeguards for International Cooperation====
Where a state has entered into a [[mutual legal assistance treaty]](MLAT) or other multi-jurisdictional agreement where more than one legal jurisdiction overlaps, the laws that apply are those which have the higher level of protection for the individual. MLAT's should also be transparent, publicly available and subject to guarantees of procedural fairness

====Safeguards against illegitimate access and right to effective remedy====
Communications surveillance by third parties should be prohibited with sufficient penalties. Protection for [[whistle-blowers]] should be enacted. Any information obtained by means not consistent with these principles should be inadmissible as evidence. Once information collected by communications surveillance has been used for the purpose for which it was collected it should be promptly destroyed or returned.

==Response==

In October 2013, The Principles were promoted in a brief filed before the President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies. They claim that "In a world of ever more complex technology, it is increasingly unclear whether the distinction between "meta-data" and other information carries much weight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.accessnow.org/blog/2014/01/24/verizon-report-bolsters-calls-to-reform-metadata-protections |title=Blog &amp;#124; Access |publisher=Accessnow.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/pdf/ReviewGroupReport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Center for Democracy and Technology]] released a report noting overlap between the Principles and a December 9, 2013 proposal by tech groups such as [[AOL]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Facebook]], [[Google]], [[Linkedin]], [[Microsoft]], [[Twitter]], and [[Yahoo!]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cdt.org/paper/common-ground-between-company-and-civil-society-surveillance-reform-principles |title=Common Ground Between Company and Civil Society Surveillance Reform Principles &amp;#124; Center for Democracy &amp; Technology |publisher=Cdt.org |date=2014-01-15 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, the principles have over 400 organizations from across the world supporting the principles along with over 40 [[Experts]], [[Academics]] and prominent individuals from over 17 countries, and 6 [[elected officials]] or [[political parties]] from 5 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/sign List of Signatories]&lt;/ref&gt;

The principles are now being used as model for reform of surveillance law and policy around the world and to provide a benchmark for measuring whether a State's surveillance practices comply with International Human Rights Law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/document/13-international-principles-application-human-rights-communication-surveillance 13 International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communication Surveillance]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3796">The '''Italy–Korea Treaty of 1884''' was negotiated between representatives of Italy and Korea.

==Background==
In 1876, Korea established a trade treaty with Japan after Japanese ships approached [[Ganghwado]] and threatened to fire on the Korean capital city. Treaty negotiations with several Western countries were made possible by the completion of this initial Japanese overture.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Chun-gil. (2005). {{Google books|hauDIGtLbnsC|''The History of Korea,'' pp. 107-108.|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, the Americans concluded a treaty and established diplomatic relations,&lt;ref&gt;Yŏng-ho Ch'oe ''et al.'' (2000). {{Google books|A9LoA9L1ABcC|''Sources of Korean Tradition,'' p. 235|page=235}}; excerpt, "''Korea signed a similar accord with the United States (the ''Treaty of Chelump'o'', 1882) that was followed by similar agreements with other Western nations'';" Korean Mission to the Conference on the Limitation of Armament, Washington, D.C., 1921-1922. (1922). {{Google books|9OdAAAAAYAAJ|''Korea's Appeal to the Conference on Limitation of Armament,'' p. 29.|page=29}}; excerpt, "Treaty and Diplomatic Relations Between the United States and Korea. Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation dated May 22, 1882."&lt;/ref&gt; which served as a template for subsequent negotiations with other Western powers.

==Treaty provisions==
The Italians and Koreans negotiated and approved a multi-article treaty with provisions similar to other Western nations.&lt;ref name="mission32"&gt;Korean Mission {{Google books|9OdAAAAAYAAJ|p. 32.|page=32}}; excerpt, "Treaty and Diplomatic Relations Between Korea and Italy. Treaty of Friendship and Commerce dated June 26, 1884"; Kim, {{Google books|hauDIGtLbnsC|p. 107.|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ministers from Italy to Korea could have been appointed in accordance with this treaty; but these duties were performed by consul generals at Shanghai, China.&lt;ref name="mission32"/&gt;

The treaty remained in effect even after [[Korea under Japanese rule|the protectorate was established]] in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Korean Mission {{Google books|9OdAAAAAYAAJ|p. 36.|page=36}}; excerpt, "''Official rescript issued by Japan, November 22, 1905, declares: 'In bringing this agreement to the notice of the powers having treaties with Korea, the Imperial Government declares that * * * they will see that these treaties are maintained and respected, and they also engage not to prejudice In any way the legitimate commercial and industrial interests of those powers in Korea'.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Legal Profession Uniform Law''' Act (LPUL) took effect in [[New South Wales]] on 1 July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Profession Uniform Law Act|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/lpul333/|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Uniform Law creates a common [[Legal services in Australia|legal services market]] across NSW and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], encompassing almost three-quarters of [[Australia]]’s lawyers. The scheme aims to harmonize regulatory obligations while retaining local performance of regulatory functions.

The Uniform Law regulates the [[Legal profession in Australia|legal profession]] across the two jurisdictions, governing matters such as practicing certificate types and conditions, maintaining and auditing of [[trust account]]s, [[continuing professional development]] requirements, complaints-handling processes, billing arrangements, and [[Professional misconduct|professional discipline]] issues.

The Uniform Law creates two bodies: The Legal Services Council, and the Commissioner for Uniform Legal Services Regulation, who also acts as CEO of the Legal Services Council. Together, these bodies set policy framework for the new scheme, and refine the way it operates by issuing guidelines and directives for the sake of consistency; making regulations; and advising [[attorney general|Attorneys General]] on any potential amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A new framework for practicing law in NSW |url=http://www.lawsociety.com.au/ForSolictors/professionalstandards/Ruleslegislation/nationalreform/|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Office of the United States Trade Representative''' ('''USTR''') is the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] agency responsible for developing and recommending [[Trade policy of the United States|United States trade policy]] to the [[President of the United States]], conducting trade negotiations at bilateral and multilateral levels, and coordinating trade policy within the government through the interagency Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) and Trade Policy Review Group (TPRG).

Established as the Office of the Special Trade Representative (STR) under the [[Trade Expansion Act]] of 1962, the USTR is part of the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|Executive Office of the President]]. With over 200 employees, the USTR has offices in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. The current '''U.S. Trade Representative''' is Ambassador [[Robert E. Lighthizer]], who was announced by President-Elect Donald J. Trump on January 3, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://greatagain.gov/ustr-dcf9bf87f3bd|title=The White House|website=whitehouse.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lighthizer was confirmed by the Senate on May 11, 2017, by a vote of 82–14.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00127|title=U.S. Senate: U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 115th Congress – 1st Session|website=www.senate.gov|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

===Leadership===
The head of the office holds the title of '''United States Trade Representative''' (USTR), which is a [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]]-level position, though not technically within the Cabinet, as is the case with office heads not of US Departments but rather of offices contained within the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|Executive Office of the President]]. To fill the post, the [[President of the United States|President]] nominates someone for the position, and the appointment is then approved or rejected by a simple majority of the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. The United States Trade Representative and Deputy United States Trade Representatives (DUSTR) carry the title of [[Ambassador]].

[[Michael Froman]] served as the US Trade Representative until 2017, with [[Michael Punke]] and [[Robert Holleyman]] serving as Deputy US Trade Representatives. Ambassador Punke also concurrently serves as the U.S. Ambassador to the [[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organization (WTO)]]. 

On May 2, 2013, President Obama nominated [[Michael Froman]] to succeed Ambassador [[Ron Kirk]] as the U.S. Trade Representative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57582530/obama-taps-penny-pritzker-mike-froman-for-top-economic-jobs/ Obama taps Penny Pritzker, Mike Froman for top economic jobs]. CBS News (2013-05-02). Retrieved on 2013-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Senate confirmed Froman on June 19, 2013, and he was sworn into office on June 21, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/morningtax/0613/morningtax10971.html Senate confirms Michael Froman as trade chief – Politics standard used in IRS cases – Lawmakers urge changes to IRS accounting rule – POLITICO Morning Tax].

Ustr.gov. Retrieved on 2013-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Office of WTO and Multilateral Affairs===
The USTR participates in the [[World Trade Organization]], which is currently in the [[Doha Development Round]]. This is partially managed by the USTR Office of WTO and Multilateral Affairs (WAMA). Relevant WTO agreements include the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS) and the [[Generalized System of Preferences]].

==Issue Areas==

===Agriculture===

There are two key advisory committees when it comes to agriculture. These two are the Agricultural Policy Advisory Committee (APAC) and the Agricultural Technical Advisory Committees (ATAC). APAC is made up of 34 organizations. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fas.usda.gov/agricultural-policy-advisory-committee-apac|title=Agricultural Policy Advisory Committee (APAC) {{!}} USDA Foreign Agricultural Service|website=www.fas.usda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ATAC is made up of 6 groups. These groups being Animal and Animal Products, Fruits and Vegetables, Grains, Feed, Oilseeds, and Planting Seeds, Sweeteners and Sweetener Products, Tobacco, Cotton, and Peanuts, and Processed Foods. APAC and ATAC allow the private sector to play a role in the U.S. government when it comes to trade.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ustr.gov/issue-areas|title=Issue Areas {{!}} United States Trade Representative|website=ustr.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Agriculture, Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) play a big role. As stated, “For 16 of the 20 countries that the U.S. has FTAs with, U.S. exporters will face zero [[Tariff|tariffs]] on 98% or more of agricultural goods once the agreements are fully implemented.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Economy and Trade===

[[International trade|Global trade]] is one area America excels. They also have the world’s largest economy. Being competitive allows an increase in productivity and the growth of the economy. Expanding and shifting production has increased productivity and the county’s economic growth rate as well. “Exports have contributed nearly a third of economic growth since mid-2009, and account for approximately 13.5 percent of our economy”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Enforcement===

USTR uses enforcement to secure U.S. trading. This is especially keen to American workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses. It is interpreted to be fair and open, making sure that everyone follows it. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Environment===

Some trade includes overlap with [[Environmental policy|environmental policies]]. Wildlife trafficking, [[illegal logging]], and [[marine conservation]] and protection are a few examples of this overlap.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Government Procurement===

The purchasing done under the government makes up 10 to 15 percent of the country’s [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. In 1979, the first major Government Procurement Agreement appeared. Relations with Canada and Europe are especially noticeable in government procurement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

===Industry and Manufacturing===

The Office of Small Business, Market Access, and Industrial Competitiveness (SBMAIC) manages manufactured goods that the United States exports. Two of the biggest goals are to expand export opportunities and strengthen enforcement of trade rules. Industrial tariffs are a huge commodity, for approximately 96 percent of U.S. merchandise imports are nonagricultural goods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

===Intellectual Property===

The Office of Intellectual Property and Innovation (IPN) focuses heavily on [[intellectual property]] laws and enforcing them worldwide. Trade agreements, the annual [[Special 301 Report|Special 301]] review and report, [[World Trade Organization]], and pharmaceutical and medical technology industries are all key areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Labor===

The Labor office holds the United States responsible in making sure they follow all labor laws. Worker’s participation and rights is looked at thoroughly through this office. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Preference Programs===

Preference programs are used as aiding other countries. It provides greater access to the U.S. market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Services and Investment===

The Office of Services and Investment partakes in anything involving services, investment, and digital trade relevant to U.S. trade policy. International Investment provides both economic growth and protection for American workers. Services allows the world to connect. Through businesses, technology, retail, and all other forms of services, people interact globally. In the United States, service industries make up two thirds of the GDP and four out of five private-sector jobs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Small Business===

Small businesses are significant in U.S. trade because they account for 98 percent of the country’s exports. The top exports going to Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

===Textiles and Apparel===

The Office of Textiles is in charge of both textiles and apparel. It works closely with Congress, domestic partners, and international ones. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Trade and Development===

Worldwide aid and domestic funding related to trade are coordinated through the USTR.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

===Trade organizations===

The [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC), [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), and the [[OECD|Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) all have an impact in trade. The WTO deals heavily with FTAs.  Licensing and trade barriers are addressed here. APEC facilitates trade with Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, China, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, The United States of America, and Vietnam. The U.S. also has a relationship with the ASEAN. ASEAN comprises of Brunei Darussalam, Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Lastly, OECD accounts for 78 percent of the entire world’s GDP and has 34 democracies in Europe, North America, the Pacific Rim, and Latin America in the organization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Reports==

===National Trade Estimate===
The ''National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers'' (National Trade Estimate or NTE) is an annual series that surveys prepared by the USTR, which reports significant foreign barriers to U.S. exports. Since 1986, the NTE provides, where feasible, quantitative estimates of the impact of these foreign practices on the value of U.S. exports. Information is also included on actions taken to eliminate barriers.&lt;ref name=ReportsAndPublications&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/reports-and-publications |title=Reports and Publications |author=Office of the United States Trade Representative |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on information provided by USTR, the [[U.S. Department of Commerce|U.S. Departments of Commerce]] and [[U.S. Department of Agriculture|Agriculture]], and other agencies and sources.&lt;ref name=ReportsAndPublications /&gt;

===The Special 301 Report===
{{main article|Special 301 Report}}
The Special 301 Report is prepared annually by the USTR under Section 182 as amended of the [[Trade Act of 1974]]. The Act states that the USTR must on an annual basis, by April of each year:
&lt;blockquote&gt;identify those foreign countries that deny adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights, or deny fair and equitable markets access to United States persons that rely upon intellectual property protection, and those foreign countries identified under" this "paragraph that are determined by the Trade Representative to be priority foreign countries". The Act defines "priority foreign countries" as "those foreign countries that have the most onerous or egregious acts, policies, or practices that deny adequate and effective intellectual property rights, or deny fair and equitable market access to United States persons that rely upon intellectual property protection, whose acts, policies, or practices described in" this "paragraph have the greatest adverse impact (actual or potential) on the relevant United States products, and that are not entering into good faith negotiations, or making significant progress in bilateral or multilateral negotiations to provide adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Masterson|first = John T.|title = International trademarks and copyright: enforcement and management|publisher = American Bar Association|year = 2004|pages = |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BIA9w-89SYcC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn = 978-1-59031-359-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[Uruguay Round Agreement Act]] furthermore states that countries may be identified under Special 301 "taking into account the history of intellectual property laws and practices of the foreign country, including any previous identifications" and "the history of efforts of the United States, and the response of the foreign country, to achieve adequate and effective protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights". It also states that compliance with the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] does not include a country from being identified as denying "adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Masterson|first = John T.|title = International trademarks and copyright: enforcement and management|publisher = American Bar Association|year = 2004|pages = 18–19 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BIA9w-89SYcC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn = 978-1-59031-359-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notorious markets===
{{Main article|Notorious markets}}
In 2006, along with the [[International Intellectual Property Alliance]], the USTR published a list of places where large-scale [[copyright infringement]] takes place in the Special 301 Report. Since 2010, the notorious markets report has been published as a separate report.

{{original synthesis|article|date=March 2016}}

The '''open-source model''' is a decentralized [[software development]] model that encourages [[open collaboration]].&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Levine, Sheen S., &amp; Prietula, M. J. (2013). [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1096442 Open Collaboration for Innovation: Principles and Performance]. ''Organization Science'', {{doi|10.1287/orsc.2013.0872}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jo4hAQAAIAAJ|title=The cathedral and the bazaar: musings on Linux and Open Source by an accidental revolutionary|last=Raymond|first=Eric S.|publisher=OReilly|year=2001|isbn=978-0-596-00108-7|authorlink=Eric S. Raymond}}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A main principle of [[open-source software development]] is [[peer production]], with products such as source code, [[blueprint]]s, and documentation freely available to the public. The open-source movement in software began as a response to the limitations of proprietary code. The model is used for projects such as in [[open-source appropriate technology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Case for Open Source Appropriate Technology |journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability |volume=14 |issue= 3|pages=425–431 |year=2012 |doi=10.1007/s10668-012-9337-9 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1517361|last1=Pearce |first1=Joshua M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and open-source drug discovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/sreelatha-menon-researchers-sans-borders/00/19/350429/ "Science 2.0 is here as CSIR resorts to open-source drug research for TB" Business Standard, 1 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://openwetware.org/wiki/OSDDMalaria:GSK_Arylpyrrole_Series:Story_so_far "Open Source Drug Discovery for Malaria Consortium]&lt;/ref&gt;

Open source promotes universal access via an [[open-source license|open-source]] or [[free license]] to a product's design or blueprint, and universal redistribution of that design or blueprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lakhani|first=K.R.|last2=von Hippel|first2=E.|year=June 2003|title=How Open Source Software Works: Free User to User Assistance|url=

''Open source'' gained hold with the rise of the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2004}}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[open-source software movement]] arose to clarify [[copyright]], [[License|licensing]], [[Domain name|domain]], and consumer issues.

Generally, open source refers to a [[computer program]] in which the [[source code]] is available to the general public for use or modification from its original design. Open-source code is meant to be a collaborative effort, where programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within the community. Code is released under the terms of a [[software license]]. Depending on the license terms, others may then download, modify, and publish their version (fork) back to the community.

Many large formal institutions have sprung up to support the development of the open-source movement, including the [[Apache Software Foundation]], which supports community projects such as the open-source framework [[Apache Hadoop]] and the open-source [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] server [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache HTTP]].

==History==
{{main|History of free and open-source software}}The sharing of technical information predates the [[Internet]] and the personal computer considerably. For instance, in the early years of automobile development a group of capital [[monopoly|monopolists]] owned the rights to a [[2 cycle|2-cycle]] gasoline-engine patent originally filed by [[George B. Selden]].&lt;ref name="carculture"&gt;{{cite book |author=James J. Flink |title=The Car Culture |publisher=MIT Press |year=1977 |isbn=978-0-262-56015-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By controlling this patent, they were able to monopolize the industry and force car manufacturers to adhere to their demands, or risk a lawsuit.

In 1911, independent automaker [[Henry Ford]] won a challenge to the Selden patent. The result was that the Selden patent became virtually worthless and a new association (which would eventually become the [[Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association]]) was formed.&lt;ref name="carculture" /&gt; The new association instituted a cross-licensing agreement among all US automotive manufacturers: although each company would develop technology and file patents, these patents were shared openly and without the exchange of money among all the manufacturers.&lt;ref name="carculture" /&gt; By the time the US entered [[World War II]], 92 Ford patents and 515 patents from other companies were being shared among these manufacturers, without any exchange of money (or lawsuits).&lt;ref name="carculture" /&gt;

Early instances of the free sharing of source code include [[IBM]]'s source releases of its [[operating system]]s and other programs in the 1950s and 1960s, and the [[SHARE (computing)|SHARE]] user group that formed to facilitate the exchange of software.&lt;ref name="autogenerated172"&gt;{{cite book|title=IBM and the U.S. Data Processing Industry: An Economic History|last=Fisher|first=Franklin M.|publisher=Praeger|year=1983|isbn=978-0-03-063059-0|pages=172–9|author2=James W. McKie|author3=Richard B. Mancke}} IBM unbundled (began charging for) software 23 June 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.cozx.com/~dpitts/ibm7090.html Dave Pitts' IBM 7090 support] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827134534/http://www.cozx.com/~dpitts/ibm7090.html |date=2015-08-27 }}{{spaced ndash}}An example of distributed source: Page contains a link to [[IBM 7090/94 IBSYS]] source, including [[COBOL]] and [[FORTRAN]] compilers.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1960s, [[ARPANET]] researchers used an open "[[Request for Comments]]" (RFC) process to encourage feedback in early telecommunication network protocols. This led to the birth of the early Internet in 1969.

The sharing of source code on the Internet began when the Internet was relatively primitive, with software distributed via [[UUCP]], [[Usenet]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], and [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]]. [[BSD]], for example, was first widely distributed by posts to comp.os.linux on the Usenet, which is also where its development was discussed. [[Linux]] followed in this model.

=== Open source as a term ===
The term "open source" was first proposed by a group of people in the [[free software movement]] who were critical of the political agenda and moral philosophy implied in the term "free software" and sought to reframe the discourse to reflect a more commercially minded position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| publisher = Stanford University| last = O'Mahony| first = Siobhan Clare| title = The emergence of a new commercial actor: Community managed software projects| location = Stanford, CA| date = 2002|pages=34–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ambiguity of the term "free software" was seen as discouraging business adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html |title=Goodbye, "free software"; hello, "open source" |quote=The problem with it is twofold. First, ... the term "free" is very ambiguous ... Second, the term makes a lot of corporate types nervous.|author=[[Eric S. Raymond]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="infoworld1983"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yy8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=us%20government%20public%20domain%20software&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q=us%20government%20public%20domain%20software&amp;f=false |website=[[InfoWorld]] |date=1983-06-23|title=Free software - Free software is a junkyard of software spare parts |quote=''"In contrast to commercial software is a large and growing body of free software that exists in the public domain. Public-domain software is written by microcomputer hobbyists (also known as "hackers") many of whom are professional programmers in their work life. [...] Since everybody has access to source code, many routines have not only been used but dramatically improved by other programmers."'' |first=Tom |last=Shea |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The group included [[Christine Peterson]], [[Todd Anderson]], [[Larry Augustin]], [[Jon Hall (programmer)|Jon Hall]], [[Sam Ockman]], [[Michael Tiemann]] and [[Eric S. Raymond]]. Peterson suggested "open source" at a meeting&lt;ref name=osihistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensource.org/history |title=History of the OSI |date=19 September 2006 |first=Michael |last=Tiemann |authorlink=Michael Tiemann |publisher=[[Open Source Initiative]] |accessdate=23 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021001164015/http://www.opensource.org/docs/history.php |archivedate=1 October 2002 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; held at [[Palo Alto, California]], in reaction to [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]]'s announcement in January 1998 of a source code release for [[Netscape Navigator|Navigator]]. [[Linus Torvalds]] gave his support the following day, and Phil Hughes backed the term in ''[[Linux Journal]]''. [[Richard Stallman]], the founder of the free software movement, initially seemed to adopt the term, but later changed his mind.&lt;ref name=osihistory/&gt;&lt;ref name="rmsdissent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html |title=Why Open Source misses the point of Free Software |publisher=fsf.org |date=2012-05-18 |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netscape released its source code under the [[Netscape Public License]] and later under the [[Mozilla Public License]].&lt;ref name="Muffatto000"&gt;{{cite book  | title = Open Source: A Multidisciplinary Approach  | first = Moreno  | last = Muffatto  | publisher = Imperial College Press  | year = 2006  | isbn = 978-1-86094-665-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raymond was especially active in the effort to popularize the new term. He made the first public call to the free software community to adopt it in February 1998.&lt;ref name="raymondCall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html |title=Goodbye, "free software"; hello, "open source" |publisher=Catb.org |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, he founded The [[Open Source Initiative]] in collaboration with [[Bruce Perens]].&lt;ref name=osihistory/&gt;

The term gained further visibility through an event organized in April 1998 by technology publisher [[Tim O'Reilly]]. Originally titled the "Freeware Summit" and later known as the "Open Source Summit",&lt;ref name=opensourcesummit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linuxgazette.net/issue28/rossum.html |title=Open Source Summit |website=Linux Gazette |date=1998-04-10 |accessdate=2015-02-07 |first=Guido |last=van Rossum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229053622/http://linuxgazette.net/issue28/rossum.html |archivedate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the event was attended by the leaders of many of the most important free and open-source projects, including Linus Torvalds, [[Larry Wall]], [[Brian Behlendorf]], [[Eric Allman]], [[Guido van Rossum]], [[Michael Tiemann]], [[Paul Vixie]], [[Jamie Zawinski]], and Eric Raymond. At that meeting, alternatives to the term "free software" were discussed. Tiemann argued for "sourceware" as a new term, while Raymond argued for "open source". The assembled developers took a vote, and the winner was announced at a press conference the same evening.&lt;ref name=opensourcesummit /&gt;

"Open source" has never managed to entirely supersede the older term "free software", giving rise to the combined term [[free and open-source software]] (FOSS).

==Economics==
{{main|Open-source economics}}
Some economists agree that open-source is an [[information good]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The economics and management of intellectual property : towards intellectual capitalism|last=Granstrand|first=Ove|publisher=E. Elgar|year=1999|isbn=978-1-85898-967-9|location=Cheltenham, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "knowledge good" with original work involving a significant amount of time, money, and effort. The cost of reproducing the work is low enough that additional users may be added at zero or near zero cost{{spaced ndash}}this is referred to as the [[marginal cost]] of a product. [[Copyright]] creates a monopoly so the price charged to consumers can be significantly higher than the marginal cost of production. This allows the author to recoup the cost of making the original work. Copyright thus creates access costs for consumers who value the work more than the marginal cost but less than the initial production cost. Access costs also pose problems for authors who wish to create a [[derivative work]]—such as a copy of a software program modified to fix a bug or add a feature, or a [[remix]] of a song—but are unable or unwilling to pay the copyright holder for the right to do so.

Being organized as effectively a "[[consumers' cooperative]]", open source eliminates some of the access costs of consumers and creators of derivative works by reducing the restrictions of copyright. Basic economic theory predicts that lower costs would lead to higher consumption and also more frequent creation of derivative works.  Organizations such as [[Creative Commons]] host websites where individuals can file for alternative "licenses", or levels of restriction, for their works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/ |title=About The Licenses |publisher=Creative Commons |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These self-made protections free the general society of the costs of policing copyright infringement.

Others argue that since consumers do not pay for their copies, creators are unable to recoup the initial cost of production and thus have little economic incentive to create in the first place. By this argument, consumers would lose out because some of the goods they would otherwise purchase would not be available. In practice, content producers can choose whether to adopt a proprietary license and charge for copies, or an open license. Some goods which require large amounts of professional research and development, such as the [[pharmaceutical industry]] (which depends largely on [[patent]]s, not copyright for intellectual property protection) are almost exclusively proprietary, although increasingly sophisticated technologies are being developed on open-source principles.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Pearce, ''[[Open-Source Lab (book)|Open-Source Lab]]: How to Build Your Own Hardware and Reduce Research Costs'', Elsevier, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that open-source development creates enormous value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://3dprintingindustry.com/2015/02/02/3d-printed-open-hardware-syringe-pump-value-800m/ 3D Printed Open Hardware Syringe Yields $800M Value, Study Finds]- ''3D Printing Industry'' 2-2-2015&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the context of [[open-source hardware]] design, digital designs are shared for free and anyone with access to digital manufacturing technologies (e.g. [[RepRap]] 3D printers) can replicate the product for the cost of materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wittbrodt | first1 = B.T. | last2 = Glover | first2 = A.G. | last3 = Laureto | first3 = J. | last4 = Anzalone | first4 = G.C. | last5 = Oppliger | first5 = D. | last6 = Irwin | first6 = J.L. | last7 = Pearce | first7 = J.M. | year = 2013 | title = Life-cycle economic analysis of distributed manufacturing with open-source 3-D printers | url = | journal = Mechatronics | volume = 23 | issue = 6| pages = 713–726 | doi = 10.1016/j.mechatronics.2013.06.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original sharer may receive feedback and potentially improvements on the original design from the [[peer production]] community.

Alternative arrangements have also been shown to result in good creation outside of the proprietary license model. Examples include:{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

*[[File:Wikipedia-logo-en-big.png|thumb|125px|Wikipedia is an example of a global application of the open source model.]]Creation for its own sake – For example, [[Wikipedia]] editors add content for recreation. Artists have a drive to create. Both communities benefit from free starting material.
* Voluntary after-the-fact donations – used by [[shareware]], [[street performer]]s, and [[public broadcasting]] in the United States.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* Patron – For example, [[open access]] publishing relies on institutional and government funding of research faculty, who also have a professional incentive to publish for reputation and career advancement. Works of the U.S. federal government are automatically released into the [[public domain]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* [[Freemium]] – Give away a limited version for free and charge for a premium version (potentially using a [[dual license]]).
* Give away the product and charge something related – Charge for support of open-source [[enterprise software]], give away music but charge for concert admission.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* Give away work in order to gain market share – Used by artists, in corporate software to spoil a dominant competitor (for example in the [[browser wars]] and the [[Android operating system]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* For own use – Businesses or individual software developers often create software to solve a problem, bearing the full cost of initial creation. They will then open source the solution, and benefit from the improvements others make for their own needs. Communalizing the maintenance burden distributes the cost across more users; [[free rider problem|free riders]] can also benefit without undermining the creation process.

==Open-source applications==
[[File:121212 2 OpenSwissKnife.png|thumb|Open-source model application domains]]
Social and political views have been affected by the growth of the concept of open source. Advocates in one field often support the expansion of open source in other fields. But [[Eric Raymond]] and other founders of the [[open-source movement]] have sometimes publicly argued against speculation about applications outside software, saying that strong arguments for software openness should not be weakened by overreaching into areas where the story may be less compelling. The broader impact of the open-source movement, and the extent of its role in the development of new information sharing procedures, remain to be seen.

The [[open-source movement]] has inspired increased [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]] and liberty in [[biotechnology]] research, for example by [http://Therapoid.net/ open therapeutics] and [[CAMBIA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambia.org/daisy/cambia/470.html |title='Open-Source Practices for Biotechnology' — Cambia — Enabling Innovation |publisher=Cambia |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the research methodologies themselves can benefit from the application of open-source principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearce|first=Joshua M.|title=Open Source Research in Sustainability|journal=Sustainability: The Journal of Record|date=1 August 2012|volume=5|issue=4|pages=238–243|doi=10.1089/sus.2012.9944}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also given rise to the rapidly-expanding [[open-source hardware]] movement.

[[Open-source hardware]] is hardware which initial specification, usually in a software format, is published and made available to the public, enabling anyone to copy, modify and redistribute the hardware and source code without paying royalties or fees. Open-source hardware evolves through community cooperation. These communities are composed of individual hardware/software developers, hobbyists, as well as very large companies. Examples of open-source hardware initiatives are:
* [[Openmoko]]: a family of open-source [[mobile phone]]s, including the hardware specification and the [[operating system]].
* [[OpenRISC]]: an open-source microprocessor family, with architecture specification licensed under [[GNU GPL]] and implementation under [[LGPL]].

Some publishers of [[open-access]] journals have argued that [[Open data|data]] from [[food science]] and [[gastronomy]] studies should be freely available to aid [[reproducibility]].&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2013/12/02/mega-bites-how-open-data-and-gastronomy-are-proving-a-recipe-for-success/&lt;/ref&gt; A number of people have published creative commons licensed recipe books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TEXTURE - A hydrocolloid recipe collection|author=Martin Lersch|url=http://blog.khymos.org/wp-content/2009/02/hydrocolloid-recipe-collection-v3.0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Open-source cola]]s – cola soft drinks, similar to [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi]], whose recipe is open source and developed by volunteers. The taste is said to be comparable to that of the standard beverages.

* In 2002, the beer company [[Brewtopia]] in Australia started an open-source brewery and invited the general population to be involved in the development and ownership of the brewery, and to vote on the development of every aspect of its beer, Blowfly, and its road to market. In return for their feedback and input, individuals received shares in the company, which is now publicly traded on a stock exchange in Australia. The company has always adhered to its open-source roots and is the only beer company in the world that allows the public to design, customise and develop its own beers online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://brewtopia.com.au/about|title=About Brewtopia|last=|first=|date=|website=Brewtopia|publisher=Brewtopia.com|accessdate=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital content===
[[File:OK LOGO COLOUR RGB.svg|thumb|125px|[[Open Knowledge Foundation]] logo]]
* Open-content projects organized by the Wikimedia Foundation – Sites such as Wikipedia and Wiktionary have embraced the open-content [[Creative Commons]] content licenses. These licenses were designed to adhere to principles similar to various open-source software development licenses. Many of these licenses ensure that content remains free for re-use, that source documents are made readily available to interested parties, and that changes to content are accepted easily back into the system. Important sites embracing open-source-like ideals are [[Project Gutenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ |title=Project Gutenberg — free ebooks |publisher=Gutenberg.org |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wikisource]], both of which post many books on which the copyright has expired and are thus in the [[public domain]], ensuring that anyone has free, unlimited access to that content.
* [[Open ICEcat]] is an open catalog for the IT, CE and Lighting sectors with product data-sheets based on [[Open Content License]] agreement. The digital content are distributed in XML and URL formats.
*[[Google Sketchup]]'s [[3D Warehouse]] is an open-source design community centered around the use of proprietary software that's free.

==Society and culture==
{{disputed section|date=December 2016}}
The rise of open-source culture in the 20th century resulted from a growing tension between creative practices that involve require access to content that is often [[copyright]]ed, and restrictive intellectual property laws and policies governing access to copyrighted content. The two main ways in which intellectual property laws became more restrictive in the 20th century were extensions to the term of copyright (particularly in the [[United States]]) and penalties, such as those articulated in the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), placed on attempts to circumvent anti-piracy technologies.&lt;ref name="copyright1998"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf |title=The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 |format=PDF |date = December 1998|author = US Copyright Office |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although artistic appropriation is often permitted under [[fair use|fair-use]] doctrines, the complexity and ambiguity of these doctrines creates an atmosphere of uncertainty among cultural practitioners. Also, the protective actions of copyright owners create what some call a "[[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]]" among cultural practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chillingeffects.org/ |title=Chilling Effects Clearinghouse |publisher=Chillingeffects.org |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of an "open-source" culture runs parallel to "[[Free Culture movement|Free Culture]]," but is substantively different. ''Free culture'' is a term derived from the [[free software movement]], and in contrast to that vision of culture, proponents of open-source culture (OSC) maintain that some intellectual property law needs to exist to protect cultural producers. Yet they propose a more nuanced position than corporations have traditionally sought. Instead of seeing intellectual property law as an expression of instrumental rules intended to uphold either natural rights or desirable outcomes, an argument for OSC takes into account diverse goods (as in "the Good life") and ends.

Sites such as [[ccMixter]] offer up free web space for anyone willing to license their work under a [[Creative Commons]] license. The resulting cultural product is then available to download free (generally accessible) to anyone with an Internet connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Open source software development – Just another case of collective invention?|url=http://ccmixter.org/about|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fccmixter.org%2Fabout&amp;date=2011-12-22|archivedate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older analog technologies such as the [[telephone]] or [[television]] have limitations on the kind of interaction users can have.

Through various technologies such as [[peer-to-peer]] networks and [[blogs]], cultural producers can take advantage of vast [[social networks]] to distribute their products. As opposed to traditional media distribution, redistributing digital media on the Internet can be virtually costless. Technologies such as [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] and [[Gnutella]] take advantage of various characteristics of the Internet protocol ([[TCP/IP]]) in an attempt to totally decentralize file distribution.

{{further|Open-source software movement}}

===Government===
* [[Open politics]] (sometimes known as ''Open-source politics'') is a political process that uses Internet technologies such as blogs, email and polling to provide for a rapid feedback mechanism between political organizations and their supporters. There is also an alternative conception of the term ''Open-source politics'' which relates to the development of public policy under a set of rules and processes similar to the open-source software movement.
* [[Open-source governance]] is similar to open-source politics, but it applies more to the democratic process and promotes the freedom of information.
* The [[South Korean government]] wants to increase its use of free and open-source software, in order to decrease its dependence on proprietary software solutions. It plans to make open standards a requirement, to allow the government to choose between multiple operating systems and web browsers. Korea's Ministry of Science, ICT &amp; Future Planning is also preparing ten pilots on using open-source software distributions.&lt;ref&gt;https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/osor/news/south-korean-government-switch-open-source&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
Open-source ethics is split into two strands:
* Open-source ethics as an ethical school – Charles Ess and David Berry are researching whether ethics can learn anything from an open-source approach. Ess famously even defined the [[Association of Internet Researchers|AoIR]] Research Guidelines as an example of open-source ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flosshub.org/sites/flosshub.org/files/berry2.pdf Berry (2004) Internet Ethics: Privacy, Ethics and Alienation{{spaced ndash}}An Open Source Approach.] (PDF file)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Open-source ethics as a professional body of rules – This is based principally on the computer ethics school, studying the questions of ethics and professionalism in the computer industry in general and software development in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=El-Emam, K |title=Ethics and Open Source |journal=Empirical Software Engineering |volume=6 |issue=4 |year=2001 |url=http://springerlink.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?wasp=hf0bld3qlk0unn8f8x2m&amp;referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,2,12;journal,14,33;linkingpublicationresults,1:100262,1#ContactOfAuthor1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Irish philosopher Richard Kearney has used the term "open-source Hinduism" to refer to the way historical figures such as Mohandas Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda worked upon this ancient tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Kearney |title=Anatheism: Returning to God After God |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BRiTJ_6JFYYC&amp;pg=PR13 |year=2011 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-14789-7 |page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
[[Open-source journalism]] formerly referred to the standard journalistic techniques of news gathering and fact checking, reflecting ''[[open-source intelligence]]'', a similar term used in military intelligence circles. Now, ''open-source journalism'' commonly refers to forms of innovative publishing of [[online journalism]], rather than the sourcing of news stories by a professional journalist. In the 25 December 2006 issue of TIME magazine this is referred to as [[user generated content|user created content]] and listed alongside more traditional open-source projects such as [[OpenSolaris]] and [[Linux]].

[[Blog|Weblogs]], or blogs, are another significant platform for open-source culture. Blogs consist of periodic, reverse chronologically ordered posts, using a technology that makes webpages easily updatable with no understanding of design, code, or [[file transfer]] required. While corporations, political campaigns and other formal institutions have begun using these tools to distribute information, many blogs are used by individuals for personal expression, political organizing, and socializing. Some, such as [[LiveJournal]] or [[WordPress]], utilize open-source software that is open to the public and can be modified by users to fit their own tastes. Whether the code is open or not, this format represents a nimble tool for people to borrow and re-present culture; whereas traditional websites made the illegal reproduction of culture difficult to regulate, the mutability of blogs makes "open sourcing" even more uncontrollable since it allows a larger portion of the population to replicate material more quickly in the public sphere.

[[Messageboards]] are another platform for open-source culture. Messageboards (also known as discussion boards or forums), are places online where people with similar interests can congregate and post messages for the community to read and respond to. Messageboards sometimes have moderators who enforce community standards of etiquette such as banning users who are [[spamming|spammers]]. Other common board features are private messages (where users can send messages to one another) as well as chat (a way to have a real time conversation online) and image uploading. Some messageboards use [[phpBB]], which is a free open-source package. Where blogs are more about individual expression and tend to revolve around their authors, messageboards are about creating a conversation amongst its users where information can be shared freely and quickly. Messageboards are a way to remove intermediaries from everyday life—for instance, instead of relying on commercials and other forms of advertising, one can ask other users for frank reviews of a product, movie or CD. By removing the cultural middlemen, messageboards help speed the flow of information and exchange of ideas.

[[OpenDocument]] is an [[open format|open]] [[document file format]] for saving and exchanging editable office documents such as text documents (including memos, reports, and books), [[spreadsheet]]s, charts, and presentations. Organizations and individuals that store their data in an open format such as OpenDocument avoid being [[Vendor lock-in|locked into]] a single software vendor, leaving them free to switch software if their current vendor goes out of business, raises their prices, changes their software, or changes their [[software license|licensing]] terms to something less favorable.

[[Open-source film|Open-source movie production]] is either an open call system in which a changing crew and cast collaborate in movie production, a system in which the end result is made available for re-use by others or in which exclusively open-source products are used in the production. The 2006 movie [[Elephants Dream]] is said to be the "world's first open movie",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elephantsdream.org/ |title=Elephants Dream |publisher=Elephants Dream |date=2006-08-13 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; created entirely using [[open-source technology]].

An open-source documentary film has a production process allowing the open contributions of archival material [[footage]], and other filmic elements, both in unedited and edited form, similar to crowdsourcing. By doing so, on-line contributors become part of the process of creating the film, helping to influence the editorial and visual material to be used in the documentary, as well as its thematic development. The first open-source documentary film is the non-profit "[[The American Revolution]]", which went into development in 2006, and will examine the role media played in the cultural, social and political changes from 1968 to 1974 through the story of radio station WBCN-FM in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;"Web Power to the People," The Boston Herald, 29 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Glory Days of the Rock of Boston," Boston Globe, Op-Ed, 18 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'BCN Documentary Looks for Archival Contributors," Boston Herald, 11 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"WBCN and The American Revolution," The Huffington Post, 11 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The film is being produced by Lichtenstein Creative Media and the non-profit Filmmakers Collaborative. Open Source Cinema is a website to create Basement Tapes, a feature documentary about copyright in the digital age, co-produced by the National Film Board of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca |title=Watch Documentaries and Animated Films Online |publisher=NFB.ca |date=2012-08-27 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Open-source film|Open-source film-making]] refers to a form of film-making that takes a method of idea formation from open-source software, but in this case the 'source' for a filmmaker is raw unedited footage rather than programming code. It can also refer to a method of film-making where the process of creation is 'open' i.e. a disparate group of contributors, at different times contribute to the final piece.

[[Open-IPTV]] is [[IPTV]] that is not limited to one recording studio, production studio, or cast. Open-IPTV uses the Internet or other means to pool efforts and resources together to create an online community that all contributes to a show.

===Education===
[[File:Global Open Educational Resources Logo.svg|thumb|125px|[[Open Educational Resources]] logo]]
Within the academic community, there is discussion about expanding what could be called the "intellectual commons" (analogous to the [[Creative Commons]]). Proponents of this view have hailed the [[OpenStax CNX|Connexions]] Project at [[Rice University]], [[MIT OpenCourseWare|OpenCourseWare]] project at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Eugene Thacker]]'s article on "open-source DNA", the "Open Source Cultural Database", [[Salman Khan (educator)|Salman Khan]]'s [[Khan Academy]] and [[Wikipedia]] as examples of applying open source outside the realm of computer software.

[[Open-source curriculum|Open-source curricula]] are instructional resources whose digital source can be freely used, distributed and modified.

Another strand to the academic community is in the area of research. Many funded research projects produce software as part of their work. There is an increasing interest in making the outputs of such projects available under an open-source license. In the UK the [[Jisc|Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)]] has developed a policy on open-source software. JISC also funds a development service called [[OSS Watch]] which acts as an advisory service for higher and further education institutions wishing to use, contribute to and develop open-source software.

On 30 March 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which included $2 billion over four years to fund the [[TAACCCT|TAACCCT program]], which is described as "the largest OER (open education resources) initiative in the world and uniquely focused on creating curricula in partnership with industry for credentials in vocational industry sectors like manufacturing, health, energy, transportation, and IT".&lt;ref&gt;http://openeducation2013.sched.org/event/23553161b01967fd7ff58eea22ce24b2#.U_qxw2Mpft8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innovation communities===
The principle of sharing pre-dates the open-source movement; for example, the free sharing of information has been institutionalized in the scientific enterprise since at least the 19th century. Open-source principles have always been part of the scientific community. The sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] described the four basic elements of the community—universal ism (an international perspective), communal ism (sharing information), disinterestedness (removing one's personal views from the scientific inquiry) and organized skepticism (requirements of proof and review) that accurately describe the scientific community today.

These principles are, in part, complemented by US law's focus on protecting expression and method but not the ideas themselves. There is also a tradition of publishing research results to the scientific community instead of keeping all such knowledge proprietary. One of the recent initiatives in scientific publishing has been [[Open access (publishing)|open access]]—the idea that research should be published in such a way that it is free and available to the public. There are currently many open access journals where the information is available free online, however most journals do charge a fee (either to users or libraries for access). The [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]] is an international effort with the goal of making all research articles available free on the Internet.

The [[National Institutes of Health]] has recently proposed a policy on "Enhanced Public Access to NIH Research Information". This policy would provide a free, searchable resource of NIH-funded results to the public and with other international repositories six months after its initial publication. The NIH's move is an important one because there is significant amount of public funding in scientific research. Many of the questions have yet to be answered—the balancing of profit vs. public access, and ensuring that desirable standards and incentives do not diminish with a shift to open access.

Farmavita.Net is a community of pharmaceuticals executives that has recently proposed a new business model of open-source pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farmavita.net/content/view/336/84/ |title=Pharmaceutical Licensing Network — Open Source Pharmaceuticals — New Business Model |publisher=Farmavita.Net |date=2007-01-12 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is targeted to development and sharing of know-how for manufacture of essential and life-saving medicines. It is mainly dedicated to the countries with less developed economies where local pharmaceutical research and development resources are insufficient for national needs. It will be limited to generic (off-patent) medicines with established use. By definition, a medicinal product has a "well-established use" if is used for at least 15 years, with recognized efficacy and an acceptable level of safety. In that event, the expensive clinical test and trial results could be replaced by appropriate scientific literature.

[[Benjamin Franklin]] was an early contributor eventually donating all his inventions including the [[Franklin stove]], [[bifocals]], and the [[lightning rod]] to the public domain.

New NGO communities are starting to use the open-source technology as a tool. One example is the Open Source Youth Network started in 2007 in Lisboa by ISCA members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isca-web.org/english/youth/yource/thenetwork] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319051530/http://www.isca-web.org/english/youth/yource/thenetwork|date=19 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Open innovation]] is also a new emerging concept which advocate putting R&amp;D in a common pool. The [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] platform is openly presenting itself as an Open innovation network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/membersminutes/20070920MembersMeeting/07.09.12-Eclipse-Open-Innovation.pdf |title=Eclipse|publisher=Eclipse.org|accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts and recreation===
Copyright protection is used in the performing arts and even in athletic activities. Some groups have attempted to remove copyright from such practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogaunity.org |title=Open Source Yoga Unity — Home |publisher=Yogaunity.org |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Russian music composer, scientist and [[Russian Pirate Party]] member Victor Argonov presented detailed raw files of his electronic opera "2032"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://argonov.ru/2032.html |title=Техно-опера "2032: Легенда о несбывшемся грядущем" |publisher=Argonov.ru |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; under free license [[Creative Commons license|CC-BY-NC 3.0]]. This opera was originally composed and published in 2007 by Russian label [[MC Entertainment]] as a commercial product, but then the author changed its status to free. In his blog [http://argonov.livejournal.com] he said that he decided to open raw files (including wav, midi and other used formats) to the public in order to support worldwide pirate actions against [[SOPA]] and [[Personal Information Protection Act|PIPA]]. Several Internet resources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muznews.rockzvuk.com/news/pervaja_v_mire_muzykalnaja_opera_s_otkrytymi_iskhodnikami/2012-01-25-202 |title=Первая в мире музыкальная опера с открытыми исходниками — 25 Января 2012 — Новости музыки и шоубизнеса |publisher=Muznews.rockzvuk.com |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linux.org.ru/forum/talks/7294092 |title=Музыкальная опера "2032" становится opensource — Talks — Форум|publisher=Linux.org.ru |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://netskop.ru/kulmztura/news_2012-01-19-16-40-02-974.html |title=Первая в мире музыкальная опера с открытыми исходниками |publisher=Netskop.ru |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; called "2032" the first open-source musical opera in history.

=== Ideologically-related movements ===
The [[open access|open-access movement]] is a movement that is similar in ideology to the open source movement. Members of this movement maintain that academic material should be readily available to provide help with “future research, assist in teaching and aid in academic purposes.” The Open access movement aims to eliminate subscription fees and licensing restrictions of academic materials&lt;ref name="ref_a4"&gt;Harnad, S.

[[Creative Commons]] is an organization that “develops, supports, and stewards legal and technical infrastructure that maximizes digital creativity, sharing, and innovation.” It encourages the use of protected properties online for research, education, and creative purposes in pursuit of a universal access.  Creative Commons provides an infrastructure through a set of copyright licenses and tools that creates a better balance within the realm of “all rights reserved” properties.&lt;ref name="Creative Commons"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/|title=Creative Commons Organization|publisher=Creative Commons|accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Creative Commons license offers a slightly more lenient alternative to “all rights reserved” copyrights for those who do not wish to exclude the use of their material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to find Creative Commons images on Flickr|url=http://www.newmediarights.org/open_source/licensing/creative_commons/how_find_creative_commons_images_flickr|website=New Media Rights|accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Zeitgeist Movement]] is an international social movement that advocates a transition into a [[sustainability|sustainable]] "resource-based economy" based on [[collaboration]] in which monetary incentives are replaced by commons-based ones with everyone [[sharing economy|having access]] to everything (from code to products) as in "open source everything".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dostaler|first1=Kim|title=The Zeitgeist Movement: Getting to the Root of the Problem|url=http://truththeory.com/2012/07/19/the-zeitgeist-movement-getting-to-the-root-of-the-problem/|accessdate=10 June 2015|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dobson|first1=Stuart|title=Forget the Class War, How to Win the Fight Against the Elite|url=http://blog.thezeitgeistmovement.com/blog/stuart-dobson/forget-class-war-how-win-fight-against-elite|accessdate=10 June 2015|date=27 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611154722/http://blog.thezeitgeistmovement.com/blog/stuart-dobson/forget-class-war-how-win-fight-against-elite|archivedate=11 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While its activism and events are typically focused on media and education, TZM is a major supporter of open source projects worldwide since they allow for uninhibited advancement of science and technology, independent of constraints posed by institutions of patenting and capitalist investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Source Ecology - Zeitgeist movement|url=http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Zeitgeist_movement|publisher=[[Open Source Ecology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Procurator General of Macau''' ('''PG''') is the senior law officer of [[Macau]]. The PG replaced the [[Secretary for Justice (Macau)|Attorney General of Macau]] in December 1999 in the new Government of Macau. The PG reports to the [[Secretariat for Administration and Justice (Macau)|Secretariat for Administration and Justice]].

==Organization==
With the exception of the title change from Attorney General to Prosecutor-General, the other office holders are the same as before the handover in 1999. The office is similar to most legal structures in Europe and North America.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4931">The '''Provisions of Oxford''' were constitutional reforms developed in 1258 to resolve a dispute between the English barons and King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]]. They asserted the right of the barons to representation in the king's government and, like the earlier [[Magna Carta]], demonstrated the ability of the barons to press their concerns in opposition to the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;R. Wickson, ''The Community of the Realm in Thirteenth Century England'' (London 1970) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==
When in the spring of 1258 [[Henry III of England|King Henry III of England]] sought financial aid from a new Parliament, he was confronted by a group of barons who insisted on a new commission of reform, in the shape of a council of twenty-four members, twelve selected by the crown, twelve by the barons.&lt;ref name="Tanner 277"&gt;J. R. Tanner, ed., ''The Cambridge Medieval History'' (Cambridge 1929)  p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; The Provisions of Oxford were the reform programme the twenty-four, including [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester]], set out.

==Provisions==
The Provisions set up a new form of government, with a 15-member Privy Council (nine baronial) to advise the king and oversee the entire administration as a standing body.&lt;ref name="Tanner 277"/&gt; They also confirmed that "there be three parliaments a year...to treat of the common wants of the kingdom, and of the king."&lt;ref&gt;Provisions, quoted in R. Wickson, ''The Community of the Realm in Thirteenth Century England'' (London 1970) p. 107-9&lt;/ref&gt; At the parliaments, the Fifteen would be checked and monitored by another body of twelve representative barons.&lt;ref name="Tanner 277"/&gt; Meanwhile the men selected (by four electors appointed by the Twenty-four) were to supervise ministerial appointments, local administration and the custody of royal castles; while recommendations for an inquest into local (mis-)government, and further measures of reform were also set out.

===Linguistic innovation===

A written confirmation of the agreement was sent to the [[sheriff]]s of all the counties of England trilingually,&lt;ref&gt;R. Berkhofer, ''The Experience of Power in Medieval Europe'' (2017)&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Latin]], [[French language|French]] and, significantly, in [[Middle English]]. The use of the English language was symbolic of the ''[[Anglicisation]]'' of the government of England and an [[antidote]] to the [[Francization]] which had taken place in the decades immediately before. The Provisions were the first government documents to be published in English since the [[Norman Conquest]] two hundred years before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordinfo.info/words/index/info/view_unit/4208/?letter=E&amp;spage=5 English and its Historical Development, Part 20 (English was re-established in Britain)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later developments==

The Provisions of Oxford were confirmed and extended in 1259 by the [[Provisions of Westminster]].&lt;ref name="Steinberg280"&gt;S. H. Steinberg, ''A New Dictionary of British History'' (London 1963) p.280&lt;/ref&gt; The administrative controls of the Provisions of Oxford were overthrown by Henry, helped by a [[papal bull]], in 1261, seeding the start of the [[Second Barons' War]] (1263–1267), which was won by the King and his royalist supporters; and they were annulled for the last time in 1266 by the [[Dictum of Kenilworth]]. However the administrative and legislative reforms the barons had initiated were taken up and confirmed in the [[Statute of Marlborough]].&lt;ref name="Steinberg280"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 1258 Provisions had a significant effect upon the development of the English [[Common Law]], limiting in part the expansion of royal jurisdiction by way of  the number of available [[writ]]s,{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} but in the main confirming the importance of the common law of the land for all, from king to commoner.&lt;ref&gt; R. Wickson, ''The Community of the Realm in Thirteenth Century England'' (London 1970) p. 53 and p. 81-2&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3498">'''Re:Sound''' is the non-profit [[performance rights]] organization  in [[Canada]] that collects and administers [[Related rights|Neighbouring Rights]] royalties on behalf of recording artists, including featured artists and session musicians and record labels in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://copyright.ubc.ca/requirements/general-information-about-socan-and-resound-fees/ "Information about SOCAN and Re:Sound Fees"]. University of British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt; Re:Sound was founded in 1997 and in French is referred to as Ré:Sonne.

Re:Sound licenses recorded music to businesses across many industries, including radio stations, satellite radio, digital music services, nightclubs, bars, restaurants, retail establishments and others. The royalties that are collected from licence fees are distributed to the recording artists and record labels that create the music that is used by these businesses.

==Collecting tariffs==
Following Canada's ''Copyright Act'', Re:Sound files tariffs before the Copyright Board of Canada on behalf or recording artists and record labels, contacts and grants licences to all Canadian commercial radio broadcasters, businesses using recorded music and background music suppliers. Re:Sound also works with similar organisations around the world to collect royalties for Canadian music creators when their intellectual property is used in other jurisdictions.

Once a tariff is certified by the Copyright Board and the tariff rates and regulations have been established by the Board. Re:Sound can begin to make contact with businesses across Canada to notify them of their possible obligations under a new tariff.

Re:Sound licences are "blanket" licences, which mean that businesses can use as much music as they wish. This eliminates the need for a business to clear large numbers of recordings with individual rights holders.

Re:Sound currently licenses businesses under tariffs for Commercial Radio, CBC Radio, Pay Audio, Background Music (restaurants, bars, retail establishments, etc.), Satellite Radio, Live Events (conference centres, hotels, karaoke bars, etc.), Dance (nightclubs, adult entertainment establishments, etc.), Fitness Activities (gyms, fitness clubs, classes, etc.)

==Distributing royalties==
Re:Sound keeps track of millions of pieces of data from Canadian commercial radio stations, satellite radio, pay audio, CBC and others. After processing and summarizing, the data is used in the distribution of royalties to the artists. Royalties collected are distributed equally between artists and record companies less only actual costs (under 15%).

'''Member Organizations'''

Re:Sound has 3 performer and 2 maker member organizations:

*[[Musicians Rights Organization of Canada MROC]] 
*[[Artisti]]

'''Proposition H''' was a local ordinance on the November 8, 2005 ballot in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], which gained national attention for its banning of most [[firearms]] within the city. The measure passed with a yes vote of 123,033 to a no vote of 89,856. The proposition was later struck down in court.

==Proposition summary==
Proposition H sought to restrict [[handgun]] possession among San Francisco residents within city limits to police and certain security professionals, and to ban the manufacture, distribution, sale and transfer of [[firearms]] and [[ammunition]] within the city. Limited exceptions to the proposition would have allowed residents to possess handguns only if required for specific professional purposes. For example, San Francisco residents who are [[security guards]], [[peace officers]], or active members of the [[U.S. armed forces]] would be permitted to possess handguns while on duty. The [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] enacted penalties for violation of this ordinance, including mandatory jail time. Until April 1, 2006, residents would have been able to [[Amnesty|surrender their handguns]] to any district station of the [[San Francisco Police Department]] or the [[San Francisco Sheriff's Department]] without penalty (no refund of buying cost was planned).

==The main sponsors==
The measure was placed on the ballot with supporting signatures from Supervisors [[Tom Ammiano]], [[Chris Daly]], [[Bevan Dufty]] and [[Matt Gonzalez]].&lt;ref name="sfgov.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgov.org/site/cityattorney_page.asp?id=41352 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081115004726/http://www.sfgov.org/site/cityattorney_page.asp?id=41352 |archivedate=2008-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supervisor [[Michela Alioto-Pier]] initially supported the ordinance but formally withdrew her sponsorship on February 23, 2005.

==Results at the polls==

The City population of San Francisco is at least 805,235, without counting people not registered, or travelling/working in the metro area.&lt;ref name="en.wikipedia.org"&gt;[[San Francisco]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demise in the courts==
Proposition H would have taken effect January 1, 2006, but enforcement was suspended by litigation.

On June 13, 2006, in the case of Fiscal v. City and County of San Francisco (Case No. CPF-05-505960), San Francisco Superior Court Judge James Warren struck down the ban, saying local governments have no such authority under California law. Judge Warren sided with the [[National Rifle Association]], [[Second Amendment Foundation]], and other petitioners represented by Chuck Michel of [http://trutanichmichel.com Trutanich-Michel, LLP], in [[Long Beach, California]], who sued on behalf of gun owners, advocates and dealers the day after the measure passed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/06/13/SFGUN.TMP&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Warren wrote in his 30-page ruling that "Proposition H is adjudged invalid as preempted by state law."&lt;ref name="sfgov.org" /&gt;

The judge's decision was not without precedent considering a California appeals court nullified an almost identical San Francisco gun ban on exactly the same grounds in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxreno.com/news/9358918/detail.html?rss=reno&amp;psp=news&lt;/ref&gt;

The City appealed Judge Warren's ruling, but lost by a unanimous decision from the three judge panel in the [[Court of Appeals]] issued on January 9, 2008. On February 19, 2008, San Francisco asked the [[California Supreme Court]] to review Court of Appeal's decision. The state Supreme Court reached a unanimous decision on April 9, 2008 that rejected the city's appeal and upheld the lower courts' decision.

In October 2008, San Francisco was forced to pay a $380,000 settlement to the National Rifle Association and other plaintiffs to cover the costs of litigating Proposition H.&lt;ref&gt;Matier, Phillip; Andrew Ross (October 27, 2008) [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/10/27/BADT13NUQI.DTL&amp;hw "Newsom's city car makes trip to his wedding."] ''San Francisco Chronicle.''

[http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/gender/sexual_health.html Gender and reproductive rights], [[World Health Organization]] website, retrieved 17 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and that this was admitted by Ulla Sandbæk in a radio interview.&lt;ref&gt;"Ulla Sandbaek, a pro-abortion MEP, told Ireland's Radio Kerry on 19th November that abortion would be funded by the EU and that this was legally possible because it was in tune with the language of the UN's 1994 Cairo conference on population."

A nearly 150% increase from funding levels under the current Regulation set at €8.1 millions for 2002. As the overall EU development budget is currently at a virtual standstill (only a 2.3% increase proposed for 2003) this can only be achieved by diverting funding from other areas of overseas aid.''

The policy was intended, in part, to replace some of the U.S. funding lost due to the [[Mexico City Policy]], the U.S. policy under the George W. Bush administration which prohibited funding of abortion through foreign aid, particularly reversing the de-funding of the [[United Nations Population Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;''The EU press office prematurely announced that UNFPA funding would be increased by "32 million euros in aid" to replace, at least part, of the US funding.''

Some locations on free, publicly viewable satellite map services have '''missing, incomplete, or unclear map data'''. In some cases, these regions have been intentionally digitally obscured or blurred.&lt;ref name="Deshpande"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Deshpande, Rajeev|title=Google Earth agrees to blur pix of key Indian sites|newspaper=The Times of India|date=4 February 2007|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-02-04/india/27872874_1_google-earth-images-concern-that-unrestricted-pictures}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Westchester County, New York]], for example, has asked [[Google]] to blur potential terrorism targets (such as an amusement park, a beach, and parking lots) from its [[satellite imagery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Westchester 'Blurs' Out Terror Targets On Google|url=http://wcbstv.com/technology/google.maps.westchester.2.719388.html|accessdate=15 July 2015|agency=[[WCBS-TV]]|date=8 May 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510223350/http://wcbstv.com/technology/google.maps.westchester.2.719388.html|archivedate=10 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, censorship of certain sites has been removed. When [[Google Maps]] was launched, images of the [[White House]] and [[United States Capitol]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] were blurred out; current versions of Google Maps and [[Google Earth]] show these sites uncensored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/21/AR2007072101296.html|title= Google's View of D.C.

==Countries in official contact with Google Maps==
During talks with the [[India]]n government, Google issued a statement saying "Google has been talking and will continue to talk to the Indian government about any security concerns it may have regarding Google Earth."&lt;ref name="BBC-2007-02-05"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Google Earth prompts Indian fears|date=5 February 2007|newspaper=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6331033.stm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308184315/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6331033.stm|archivedate=8 March 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google agreed to blur images on request of the Indian government.&lt;ref name="Deshpande" /&gt;

The Australian government has decided that images of sensitive areas are not a risk, due to poor level of detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Judy|last=Skatssoon |url=http://abc.net.au/science/articles/2005/08/08/1432823.htm |title=Lucas Heights image stays on Google |location=34.0516520;150.9804300 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] |date=8 August 2005 |accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that in the lead-up to the [[APEC]] forum in [[Sydney]] held in September 2007 certain key locations in images of the city's central business district, where APEC leaders were meeting, might have been intentionally reduced in resolution; however, Google has indicated that the change was unrelated to APEC, while the [[New South Wales|NSW]] police said that they knew nothing about the change in Google's images. It is known that images of Her Majesty's Australian Prisons are intentionally blurred out. Images of the prime minister's official residence, [[The Lodge (Australia)|The Lodge]] have not been blurred. However, images of its roof have been and the entrance to The Lodge is blurred in [[Google Street View]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Moses| first = Asher| title = Google's photos of Sydney go all fuzzy| newspaper = [[Sydney Morning Herald]]| date = 13 August 2007| url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/web/aerial-images-of-cbd-fuzzed-out-before-apec/2007/08/13/1186857396182.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1| accessdate = 13 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of [[Malaysia]] has stated that it will not ask Google to censor sensitive areas because [[Streisand effect|that would identify the locations]] it deemed to be sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/nst/Wednesday/National/20070328080627/Article/local1_html Parliament In Brief: ‘No need to blur images’] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509182328/http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/nst/Wednesday/National/20070328080627/Article/local1_html |date=May 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of map locations with missing or unclear data==
&lt;!-- PLEASE do not list every little censored location in every map service. If we did that, the list would be impossible to fully read. Limit this to notable and exceptional cases ONLY; Private homes in particular number in the thousands, so any addition of blurred private homes will be reverted. --&gt;

Most military and defense facilities, along with many private homes, appear blurred in mapping services. The vast majority of [[Antarctica]] is also in low resolution due to the bright, often featureless, ice and snow making high-resolution imaging both difficult and largely unnecessary.

{{Main|Feudal land tenure}}
'''Scutage''' is a [[Taxation in medieval England|medieval English tax]] levied on holders of a [[knight's fee]] under the [[feudal land tenure]] of [[knight-service]]. Under [[feudalism]] the king, through his vassals, provided land to knights for their support. The knights owed the king military service in return. The knights were allowed to "buy out" of the military service by paying scutage. As time passed the king began to impose a scutage on holders knight's fees, even in time of peace.

== General information ==
The institution existed under [[Henry I of England | Henry I]] (reigned 1100–1135) and [[Stephen of England | Stephen]] (reigned 1135–1154), when it occurs as ''scutagium'', ''scuagium'' or ''escuagium''.  The creation of fractions of knights' fee probably hastened its introduction: the holders of such fractions could only discharge their obligation ''via'' scutage.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Scutage |volume=24 |pages=517–518 |first=John Horace |last=Round}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The increasing use of [[mercenary|mercenaries]] in the 12th century would also make a money payment of greater use to the crown.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Separate levies of scutage received the names of the campaigns for which they were raised, as "the scutage of Toulouse" (or "great scutage"), "the scutage of Ireland", and so forth.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The levy demanded from each fee one [[Mark (money)| mark]] (13s. 4d., two thirds of a pound), one [[Pound sterling|pound]] or two marks, but anything above a pound seemed abnormal till [[John of England|John]] (reigned 1199–1216) imposed levies of two marks in most years without even the excuse of a war.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;  The irritation caused by these exactions reached a climax in 1214, when John demanded three marks.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Taxation through scutage became a prominent cause among the many that led to the rebellion of 1215, which culminated in the proclamation of [[Magna Carta]] of 1215. Its provisions prohibited the crown from levying any scutage save by "the common counsel of our realm".&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; 

The reissued Charter of 1217 provided, instead of this, that scutage levies should remain at the rate as of the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]].  In practice, however, under [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (reigned 1216–1272), scutage rates usually amounted to three marks, but required the assent of the barons, and levies occurred only on adequate occasions.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Meanwhile, a practice had arisen, possibly as early as [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]'s reign (1189–1199), of accepting from great barons special "fines" for permission not to serve in a campaign.  This practice appears to have rested on the crown's right to decide whether to exact personal service or to accept scutage ''in lieu'' of service.  A system of special composition thus arose which largely replaced the old one of scutage.  As between the [[tenants-in-chief]], however, and their [[under-tenant]]s, the payment of scutage continued.  The terms of charters of [[subinfeudation]], which specified the quota of scutage due rather than the proportion of a knight's fee granted, often stereotyped scutage.  For the purpose of recouping themselves by levying from their under-tenants, the tenants-in-chief received from the crown writs ''de scutagio habendo''.  Under [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] (reigned 1272–1307) the new system developed so completely that the six levies of the reign, each as high as two pounds on the fee, applied in practice only to the under-tenants, their lords compounding with the crown by the payment of large sums, though their nominal assessment, somewhat mysteriously, became much lower (see [[Knight service]]).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Scutage rapidly became obsolescent as a source of revenue, [[Edward II of England |Edward II]] (reigned 1307–1327) and [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] (reigned 1327–1377) imposing only one levy each and relying on other  more uniform and direct modes of taxation.  The lengths to which subinfeudation had gone also hastened its rapid decay; increasing subinfeudation led to constant dispute and litigation as to which of the holders in the descending chain of tenure remained liable for the payment.  Apart from its financial aspect it had possessed a legal importance as the test, according to [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton]], of tenure by knight-service, its payment, on however small a scale, proving the tenure to be "military" with all the consequences involved.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Scholarship==
[[J. F. Baldwin]]'s ''The Scutage and Knight Service in England'' (1897), a dissertation printed at the University of Chicago Press, offers a major monograph on the subject (though not wholly free from error).  [[Thomas Madox|Madox]]'s ''History of the Exchequer'' formerly formed the standard authority.  [[J. H. Round]] in ''Feudal England'' (1895) first set forth a more modern view. In 1896 appeared the ''[[Red Book of the Exchequer]]'' ([[Rolls series]]), which, with the ''[[Book of Fees]]'' (Public Record Office) and the [[Pipe Rolls]] (published by the Record Commission and the Pipe Roll Society), provides the chief record authority on the subject; but the editor misdated many of the scutages, and JH Round in his ''Studies on the Red Book of the Exchequer'' (privately issued) and his ''Commune of London and other Studies'' (1899) severely criticized his conclusions.  See also Pollock and Maitland's ''History of English Law'' (1895)  and  McKechnie's ''Magna Carta'' (1905). Scargill Bird's "Scutage and Marshal’s Rolls" in ''Genealogist'' (1884), vol. i., has important coverage of later records.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The '''Seychelles–Tanzania Maritime Boundary Agreement''' is a 2002 [[treaty]] between [[Seychelles]] and [[Tanzania]] which [[Boundary delimitation|delimits]] the [[maritime boundary]] between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;Charney, Jonathan ''et al.'' (2005). ''International Maritime Boundaries,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;3795–3804.&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement was signed in [[Victoria, Seychelles]] on 23 January 2002.  The [[border|boundary]] set out by the text of the treaty is a relatively short 17 [[nautical miles]] long.  It consists of nine straight-line [[ocean|maritime]] segments defined by ten individual coordinate points. The precision of the treaty is unusual, with the boundary being defined to the nearest three millimetres of the Earth's surface (to the fourth decimal place of one [[Minute of arc|second]] of the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] coordinates). Only one other maritime boundary is defined as precisely—the [[Iraq]]–[[Kuwait]] maritime boundary, which was defined in 1993 by the [[United Nations]] Boundary Demarcation Committee. The agreed-to boundary is an approximate equidistant line between the two countries. The two countries had been negotiating their maritime boundary since 1989.

The treaty came into force on the day of signature. The full name of the treaty is ''Agreement between the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania and the Government of the Republic of Seychelles on the Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary of the Exclusive Economic Zone and Continental Shelf''.

{{homicide}}
'''Siblicide''' (attributed by behavioural ecologist Doug Mock to Barbara M. Braun) is the killing of an infant individual by its close relatives (full or half siblings). It may occur directly between [[sibling]]s or be mediated by the parents. The evolutionary drivers may be either indirect benefits for the [[Genetics|genetic]] viability of a [[population]] or direct benefits for the perpetrators. Siblicide has mainly, but not only, been observed in [[bird]]s.

The word is also used as a unifying term for [[fratricide]] and [[sororicide]] in the [[human species]]; unlike these more specific terms, it leaves the sex of the victim unspecified.

Siblicidal behavior can be either obligate or facultative. '''Obligate siblicide''' is when a sibling almost always ends up being killed. '''Facultative siblicide''' means that siblicide may or may not occur, based on environmental conditions. In birds, obligate siblicidal behavior results in the older chick killing the other chick(s).&lt;ref name="avian"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mock, D. W.|author2=Drummond, H.|author3=Stinson, C. H.|last-author-amp=yes |year=1990 |url=http://www.ecfs.org/projects/prepole/ANIMAL%20Behavior%2009/Parenting%20Articles/Siblicide.pdf |title=Avian Siblicide |journal=American Scientist |volume=78 |pages=438–449 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In facultative siblicidal animals, fighting is frequent, but does not always lead to death of a sibling; this type of behavior often exists in patterns for different species.  For instance, in the blue-footed booby, a sibling may be hit by a nest mate only once a day for a couple of weeks and then attacked at random, leading to its death. More birds are facultatively siblicidal than obligatory siblicidal.&lt;ref name="evolution"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anderson, David J.|url=http://www.wfu.edu/~djanders/labweb/reprints/Anderson%201900%20Am%20Nat.pdf|title=Evolution of obligate siblicide in boobies: A test of the insurance egg hypothesis|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=135|number=3|date=March 1990|pages=334–350|doi=10.1086/285049|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601180637/http://www.wfu.edu/~djanders/labweb/reprints/Anderson%201900%20Am%20Nat.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is perhaps because siblicide takes a great amount of energy and is not always advantageous.

Siblicide generally only occurs when resources, specifically food sources, are scarce.&lt;ref name="avian"/&gt; Siblicide is advantageous for the surviving offspring because they have now eliminated most or all of their competition. It is also somewhat advantageous for the parents because the surviving offspring most likely have the strongest genes, and so, will pass these genes onto their offspring later in life, creating a strong line of genetics.

Some parents encourage siblicide, while others prevent it.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} If resources are scarce, the parents may encourage siblicide because only some offspring will survive anyway, so they want the strongest offspring to survive. By letting the offspring kill each other, it saves the parents time and energy that would be wasted on feeding offspring that most likely would not survive anyway.

[[Parent–offspring conflict]] is a theory which states that offspring can take actions to advance their own fitness while decreasing the fitness of their parents and that parents can increase their own fitness while simultaneously decreasing the fitness of their offspring. This is one of the driving forces of siblicide because it increases the fitness of the offspring by decreasing the amount of competition they have.&lt;ref name="siblicide"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1996|author=Rodríguez-Gironés, M. A.|url=http://www.eeza.csic.es/eeza/documentos/RdzGirones1996AmNat.pdf |title=Siblicide: The Evolutionary Blackmail|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=148|issue=1|pages=101–122|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928234421/http://www.eeza.csic.es/eeza/documentos/RdzGirones1996AmNat.pdf|archivedate=September 28, 2010|deadurl=yes|doi=10.1086/285913}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents may either discourage or accept siblicide depending on whether it increases the probability of their offspring surviving to reproduce.&lt;ref name="siblicide"/&gt;

Inclusive fitness is defined as an animal's individual reproductive success, plus the positive and/or negative effects that animal has on its sibling's reproductive success, multiplied by the animal's degree of kinship.  In instances of siblicide, the victim is usually the youngest sibling.  This sibling's reproductive value can be measured by how much it enhances or detracts from the success of other siblings, therefore this individual is considered to be marginal.  The marginal sibling can act as an additional element of parental success if it, as well as its siblings, survive.  If an older sibling happens to die unexpectedly, the marginal sibling is there to take its place; this acts as insurance against the death of another sibling, which depends on the likelihood of the older sibling dying.

==Mathematical representation==
The cost and effect siblicide has on a brood's reproductive success can be broken down into an algebraic equation.  &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the level of parental investment in the entire brood, with an absolute maximum value MH(0 ≤M ≤M"H)."   A parent investing &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; units of parental investment (PI) in its current brood can expect a future reproductive success &lt;math&gt;f(M)&lt;/math&gt; given by

&lt;math&gt;fH&lt;/math&gt; if M ≤ 0

f(M)= { fH[1-(M/MH)^θ ] if &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; M &lt; MH&lt;/math&gt;

if MH≤M,

&lt;math&gt;fH&lt;/math&gt; is the parents' future reproductive success, if it makes no reproductive attempt.  The parameter ᶿ determines the relationship between parental investment and the cost of reproduction.  The equation indicates that as &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; increases, the future reproductive success of the parent decreases.

The probability p(m) that a chick joins the breeding population after receiving M units of PI is

'''&lt;math&gt;P(m) = 1-Mv/m&lt;/math&gt;   if &lt;math&gt;m &gt; mv&lt;/math&gt;

if m ≤  mv

==Examples==

===In birds===
[[Cattle egret]]s, ''Bubulcus ibis'', exhibit asynchronous hatching and [[androgen]] loading in the first two eggs of their normal three-egg clutch. This results in older chicks being more aggressive and having a developmental head start. If food is scarce the third chick often dies or is killed by the larger siblings and so parental effort is distributed between the remaining chicks, which are hence more likely to survive to reproduce. The extra "excess" egg is possibly laid either due to exploit the possibility of elevated food abundance (as seen in the [[blue-footed booby]], ''Sula nebouxii'') or due to the chance of [[infertility|sterility]] in one egg. This is suggested by studies into the [[common grackle]], ''Quiscalus quiscula''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Henry F. Howe|title=Egg Size, Hatching Asynchrony, Sex, and Brood Reduction in the Common Grackle|journal=Ecology|volume= 57|number= 6|year=1976|pages=1195–1207|doi=10.2307/1935044}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[masked booby]], ''Sula dactylatra''.&lt;ref name="evolution"/&gt;

The theory of [[kin selection]] may be seen as a genetically mediated altruistic response within closely related individuals whereby the fitness conferred by the altruist to the recipient outweighs the cost to itself or the sibling/parent group. The fact that such a sacrifice occurs indicates an evolutionary tendency in some taxa toward improved vertical gene transmission in families or a higher percentage of the unit in reaching a reproductive age in a resource-limited environment.

The closely related masked and [[Nazca boobies]] are both obligately siblicidal species, while the blue-footed booby is a facultatively siblicidal species.&lt;ref name="reduction"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anderson, D. J.|year=1995|title=The role of parents in siblicidal brood reduction of two booby species|journal=The Auk|volume=112|issue=4|pages=860–869|url=http://users.wfu.edu/djanders/labweb/reprints/Anderson%201995%20Auk.pdf|doi=10.1007/BF00302994|access-date=2016-02-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418152020/http://users.wfu.edu/djanders/labweb/reprints/Anderson%201995%20Auk.pdf|archive-date=2016-04-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a facultatively siblicidal species, aggression occurs between siblings but is not always lethal, whereas in an obligately siblicidal species, aggression between siblings always leads to the death of one of the offspring.&lt;ref name="avian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="evolution"/&gt; All three species have an average brood size of two eggs,&lt;ref name="reduction"/&gt;&lt;ref name="loss"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Drummond, H.|author2=C.

Therefore, when the junior chick (B-chick) hatches, there is a significant disparity in size and strength between it and its older sibling.&lt;ref name="siblings"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gonzalez-Voyer, A.|author2=T.

In these three booby species, hatching order indicates chick hierarchy in the nest.&lt;ref name="avian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="siblings"/&gt; The A-chick is dominant to the B-chick, which in turn is dominant to the C chick, etc. (when there are more than two chicks per brood)&lt;ref name="kin"/&gt; Masked booby and Nazca booby dominant A-chicks always begin pecking their younger sibling(s) as soon as they hatch;&lt;ref name="kin"/&gt; moreover, assuming it is healthy, the A-chick usually pecks its younger sibling to death or pushes it out of the nest scrape within the first two days that the junior chick is alive.&lt;ref name="experimental"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Clifford, L. D.|author2=D. J. Anderson|last-author-amp=yes|year=2001|title=Experimental demonstration of the insurance value of extra eggs in an obligately siblicidal seabird|journal=Behavioral Ecology|volume=12|issue=3|pages=340–347|doi=10.1093/beheco/12.3.340|url=http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/12/3/340.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue-footed booby A-chicks also express their dominance by pecking their younger sibling. However, unlike the obligately siblicidal masked and Nazca booby chicks, their behavior is not always lethal.&lt;ref name="parent"/&gt; A study by Lougheed and Anderson (1999) reveals that blue-footed booby senior chicks only kill their siblings in times of food shortage. Furthermore, even when junior chicks are killed, it does not happen immediately. According to Anderson, the average age of death of the junior chick in a masked booby brood is 1.8 days, while the average age of death of the junior chick in a blue-footed booby brood may be as high as 18 days.&lt;ref name="reduction"/&gt; The difference in age of death in the junior chick in each booby species is indicative of the type of siblicide that the species practices. Facultatively siblicidal blue-footed booby A-chicks only kill their nest mate(s) when necessary. Obligately siblicidal masked and Nazca booby A-chicks kill their sibling no matter if resources are plentiful or not; in other words, siblicidal behavior occurs independently of environmental factors.

Blue-footed boobies are less likely to commit siblicide and if they do, they commit it later after hatching than masked boobies. In a study, the chicks of blue-footed and masked boobies were switched to see if the rates of siblicide would be affected by the foster parents. It turns out that the masked boobies that were placed under the care of blue-footed booby parents committed siblicide less often than they would normally. Similarly, the blue-footed booby chicks placed with the masked booby parents committed siblicide more often than they normally did, indicating that parental intervention also affects the offspring's behavior.

In another experiment which tested the effect of a synchronous brood on siblicide, three groups were created: one in which all the eggs were synchronous, one in which the eggs hatched asynchronously, and one in which asynchronous hatching was exaggerated. It was found that the synchronous brood fought more, was less likely to survive than the control group, and resulted in lower parental efficiency. The exaggerated asynchronous brood also had a lower survivorship rate than the control brood and forced parents to bring more food to the nest each day, even though not as many offspring survived.

Originally proposed by Dorward (1962), the insurance egg hypothesis (IEH) has quickly become the most widely supported explanation for avian siblicide as well as the overproduction of eggs in siblicidal birds.&lt;ref name="evolution"/&gt; The IEH states that the extra egg(s) produced by the parent serves as an "insurance policy" in the case of the failure of the first egg (either it did not hatch or the chick died soon after hatching). When both eggs hatch successfully, the second chick, or B-chick, is known as the marginal offspring; otherwise stated, it is marginal in the sense that it can add to or subtract from the evolutionary success of its family members.&lt;ref name="avian"/&gt; It can increase reproductive and evolutionary success in two primary ways. Firstly, it represents an extra unit of parental success if it survives along with its siblings. In the context of Hamilton's [[inclusive fitness]] theory, the marginal chick increases the total number of offspring successfully produced by the parent and therefore adds to the gene pool that the parent bird passes to the next generation. Secondly, it can serve as a replacement for any of its siblings that do not hatch or die prematurely.

===In other animals===
Siblicide (brood reduction) in [[spotted hyena]]s (''Crocuta crocuta'') resulted in the champions achieving a long-term growth rate similar to that of singletons and thus significantly increased their expected survival. The incidence of siblicide increased as the average cohort growth rate declined.  When both cubs were alive, total maternal input in siblicidal litters was significantly lower than in non-siblicidal litters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hofer, H.|author2=East, M. L.|last-author-amp=yes |title=Siblicide in Serengeti spotted hyenas: a long-term study of maternal input and cub survival |journal=Behav Ecol Sociobiol |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=341–351 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2007 |url=http://resources.metapress.com/pdf-preview.axd?code=h26431715736rkw8&amp;size=largest |doi=10.1007/s00265-007-0421-3 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once siblicide has occurred, the growth rates of siblicide survivors substantially increased, indicating that mothers don't reduce their maternal input after siblicide has occurred. Also, facultative siblicide can evolve when the fitness benefits gained after the removal of a sibling by the dominant offspring, exceeds the costs acquired in terms of decreasing that sibling's inclusive fitness from the death of its sibling.

Some mammals sometimes commit siblicide for the purpose of gaining a larger portion of the parent's care. In spotted hyenas, pups of the same sex exhibit siblicide more often than male-female twins. [[Sex ratio]]s may be manipulated in this way and the dominant status of a female and transmission of [[genes]] may be ensured through a son or daughter which inherits this solely, receiving much more parental nursing and decreased sexual competition.

Siblicidal "[[survival of the fittest]]" is also exhibited in parasitic [[wasps]], which lay multiple eggs in a host, after which the strongest [[larva]] kills its rival sibling. Another example is when [[Nymphalis antiopa|mourning cloak]] larvae will eat non-hatched eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Virtual Nature Trail at Penn State New Kensington|publisher= Pennsylvania State University|accessdate= October 4, 2013|url=http://www.psu.edu/dept/nkbiology/naturetrail/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In humans===
Siblicide can also be seen in humans in the form of twins in the mother's womb. One twin may grow to be an average weight, while the other is underweight. This is a result of one twin taking more nutrients from the mother than the other twin. In cases of [[identical twins]], they may even have Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sebire, N.|author2=Souka, A.|author3=Skentou, H.|author4=Geerts, L.|author5=Nicolaides, K.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2000|title=Early prediction of severe twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome|journal=Human Reproduction|volume=15|issue=9|doi=10.1093/humrep/15.9.2008|pmid=10967005|pages=2008–2010|url=http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/9/2008.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the twins share the same placenta and blood and nutrients can then move between twins.  The twins may also be suffering from Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR), meaning that there is not enough room for both of the twins to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Resnik, R.|title=Intrauterine Growth Restriction|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=99|issue=3|pages=490–496|url=http://utilis.net/Morning%20Topics/Obstetrics/IUGR.PDF|pmid=11864679|doi=10.1097/00006250-200203000-00020|year=2002|access-date=2016-02-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418160046/http://utilis.net/Morning%20Topics/Obstetrics/IUGR.PDF|archive-date=2016-04-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All of these factors can limit the growth of one of the twins while promoting the growth of the other.  While one of the twins may not die because of these factors, it is entirely possible that their health will be compromised and lead to complications after their birth.

Siblicide in humans can also manifest itself in the form of murder.  There was a significantly greater proportion of accidental deaths in half-siblings, stepsiblings, and sibling in-laws than in full siblings.  This type of killing (siblicide) is rarer than other types of killings.  Genetic relatedness may be an important moderator of conflict and homicide among family members, including siblings.  Siblings may be less likely to kill a full sibling because that would be a decrease in their own fitness.  The cost of killing a sibling is much higher than the fitness costs associated with the death of a sibling-in-law because the killer wouldn't be losing 50% of their genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Michalski, R. L.|author2=Russell, D. P.|author3=Shackelford, T. K.|author4=Weekes-Shackelford, V. A.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2007|url=http://www.toddkshackelford.com/downloads/Michalski-Russell-HS.pdf |title=Siblicide and genetic relatedness in Chicago, 1870-1930|journal=Homicide Studies|doi=10.1177/1088767907304098|volume=11|number=3|pages=231–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Siblicide was found to be more common in early to middle adulthood as opposed to adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Daly, M.|author2=Wilson, M.|author3=Salmon, C. A.|author4=Hiraiwa-Hasegawa, M.|author5=Hasegawa, T.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2001|title=Siblicide and seniority|journal= Homicide Studies|volume=5|number=1|pages=30–45|url=http://hsx.sagepub.com/content/5/1/30.abstract|doi=10.1177/108876790100500100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, there is still a tendency for the killer to be the younger party when the victim and killer were of the same sex.  The older individual was most likely to be the killer if the incident were to occur at a younger age.

In [[criminology]], '''state crime''' is activity or [[Omission (criminal law)|failures]] to act that break the [[State (polity)|state]]'s own [[criminal law]] or [[public international law]]. For these purposes, Ross (2000b) defines a "state" as the elected and appointed officials, the bureaucracy, and the institutions, bodies and organisations comprising the apparatus of the [[government]]. Initially, the state was the agency of [[Deterrence (legal)|deterrence]], using the threat of [[punishment]] as a [[utilitarian]] tool to shape the behaviour of its citizens. Then, it became the mediator, interpreting society's wishes for conflict resolution. Theorists then identified the state as the "victim" in [[Public order crime|victimless crime]]s. Now, theorists are examining the role of the state as one of the possible perpetrators of crime (Ross, 2000b) whether directly or in the context of [[state-corporate crime]].

Green &amp; Ward (2004) adopt [[Max Weber]]'s thesis of a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] “state” as claiming a [[monopoly on the legitimate use of force]]. Thus, the criteria for determining whether a state is "deviant" will draw on international norms and standards of behaviour for achieving the state’s usual operating goals. One of those standards will be whether the state respects [[human rights]] in the exercise of its powers. But, one of the definitional difficulties is that the states themselves define what is criminal within their own territories, and as sovereign powers, they are not accountable to the international community unless they submit to international [[jurisdiction]] generally, or [[criminal jurisdiction]] in particular.

==Discussion==
As [[crime against international law|international crimes]], a state may engage in state terror and [[terrorism]], [[torture]], [[war crimes]], and [[genocide]]. Both internationally and nationally, there may be [[Political corruption|corruption]], [[state-corporate crime]], and [[organized crime]]. Within its territorial borders, some crimes are either the result of situations where the state is not the direct criminal actor, e.g. arising from natural disasters or through the agency of bodies such as the [[police]]. More usually, the state is directly involved in excessive secrecy and cover-ups, disinformation, and unaccountability (including tax evasion by officials) which often reflect upper-class and nonpluralistic interests, and infringe human rights (Ross, 2000a). One of the key issues is the extent to which, if at all, state crime can be controlled. Often state crimes are revealed by an investigative news agency resulting in scandals but, even among first world democratic states, it is difficult to maintain genuinely independent control over the criminal enforcement mechanisms and few senior officers of the state are held personally accountable. When the [[citizen]]s of second and third world countries which may be of a more authoritarian nature, seek to hold their leaders accountable, the problems become more acute. Public opinion, media attention, and public protests, whether violent or nonviolent, may all be criminalised as [[political crime]]s and suppressed, while critical international comments are of little real value. 

Barak (1991) examines recent history through Reaganism and [[Thatcherism]] which led to a decline in the provision of social services and an increase in public security functions. In turn, this created the opportunity for injustices and state crimes involving the suppression of democratic functions within the state. As Johns and Johnson (1994) note, "The concern of the U.S. policy elites is not, therefore, with the establishment or protection of democracy; it is with the establishment of capitalism world-wide and with the unimpeded control of resources and markets" (p7) "Panama is an especially good example of how the rollback strategy involves subverting or overthrowing not only governments that are socialist or left-wing but the governments of countries that seek full independence from the economic, political, or military influence of the United States" (pp9/10) But, in terms of accountability, they argue that the coverage of the invasion demonstrated "just how subservient the corporate media had become to the political elite in the United States" (p63) Hence, even in democratic countries, it can be difficult to hold political leaders accountable, whether politically or legally, because access to reliable factual information can be limited.

Within the context of state-corporate crime, Green and Ward (2004) examine how the debt repayment schemes in developing countries place such a financial burden on states that they often collude with corporations offering prospects of capital growth. Such collusion frequently entails the softening of environmental and other regulations. The debt service obligation can also exacerbate political instability in countries where the legitimacy of state power is questioned. Such political volatility leads states to adopt clientelistic or patrimonialist patterns of governance, fostering organized crime, corruption, and authoritarianism. In some third world countries, this political atmosphere has encouraged repression and the use of torture. Exceptionally, genocide has occurred.

'''The Supreme Court of the German Democratic Republic''' ({{lang-de|Oberstes Gericht der DDR}}) was the highest judicial organ of the GDR. It was set up in 1949 and was housed on Scharnhorststraße 6 in [[Berlin]]. The building now houses the district court in Berlin, Germany 2 Instance and the District Court Berlin-Mitte. In the early days, 14 judges made up the court. 

==Responsibilities==
Among the responsibilities of the court included 
* The conduct of criminal proceedings in the first body, in which the Supreme Public Prosecutor of the Republic because of the paramount importance of prosecuting cases before the Supreme Court raised
* [[Kassatorische Decision|Cassation]] in civil and criminal matters
* [[vocation]] against decisions of acquittal for annulment actions of Office for invention and patent system in patent invalidity matters.

Later other tasks were added, mainly due to the process of simplification which is attributable to the pace of [[DDR-Justiz]].

A constitutional court and special administrative, social and financial judicial branches did not exist in the GDR.

==Notable figures==
* President: [[Kurt Schumann]] (1949–60, [[NDPD]]), [[Heinrich Toeplitz]] (1960–86, [[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|CDU]]), [[Guenter Sarge]] (1986–1989, [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]])
* Vice President: [[Hilde Benjamin]] (1949–1953, [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]]); Vice President and Chairman of the College of Criminal Law: [[Walter Ziegler]], (new 1st Vice President) Guenter Sarge (1977–1986)
* Chairman of the College in civil, family and employment law: Werner Strasberg Mountain
* General Prosecutors: [[Ernst Melsheimer]] (1949–1960, SED), [[Josef Streit]] (1962–1986), [[Guenter Wendland]] (1986–1989), [[Harri Harland]] (1989 / 1990), [[Hans-Juergen Joseph]] (1-6/1990);

[[File:Tethering.jpg|thumb|A phone tethered to a laptop]]

'''Tethering''', or '''phone-as-modem''' ('''PAM'''), is the sharing of a [[mobile device]]'s Internet connection with other connected computers. Connection of a mobile device with other devices can be done over [[wireless LAN]] ([[Wi-Fi]]), over [[Bluetooth]] or by physical connection using a cable, for example through [[USB]].

If tethering is done over WLAN, the feature may be branded as a '''personal''' or '''mobile hotspot''', which allows the device to serve as a portable router. Mobile [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)#Software hotspots|hotspot]]s may be protected by a PIN or password.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goingtechy.com/what-is-wifi-hotspot-in-android-smartphones/|title=Goingtechy.com|author=|date=|website=www.goingtechy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet-connected mobile device can act as a portable [[wireless access point]] and [[router (computing)|router]] for devices connected to it.

==Mobile device's OS support==
Many mobile devices are equipped with software to offer tethered Internet access. [[Windows Mobile 6.5]], [[Windows Phone 7]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] (starting from version 2.2), and [[iOS]] 3.0 (or later) offer tethering over a Bluetooth PAN or a USB connection. Tethering over Wi-Fi, also known as Personal Hotspot, is available on iOS starting with iOS 4.2.5 (or later) on [[iPhone 4]], [[iPhone 4S|4S]] (2010), [[iPhone 5|5]], [[iPad (3rd generation)]], certain Windows Mobile 6.5 devices like the [[HTC HD2]], Windows Phone 7, 8 and 8.1 devices (varies by manufacturer and model), and certain Android phones (varies widely depending on carrier, manufacturer, and software version).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/articles/mobile/android-2-2-to-support-tethering-and-turn-your-phone-into-a-mobile-wifi-hotspot-20100514/|title=Android 2.2 to support tethering and turn your phone into a mobile WiFi hotspot - Geek.com|author=|date=14 May 2010|website=geek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For IPv4 networks, the tethering normally works via [[Network Address Translation|NAT]] on the handset's existing data connection, so from the network point of view, there is just one device with a single [[IPv4 network address]], though it is technically possible to attempt to identify multiple machines.

On some [[mobile network operator]]s, this feature is contractually unavailable by default, and may only be activated by paying to add a tethering package to a data plan or choosing a data plan that includes tethering, such as [[Lycamobile]] [[MVNO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lycamobile.us/en/termsandconditions|title=Terms and Conditions - Lycamobile|author=|date=|website=www.lycamobile.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done primarily because with a computer sharing the network connection, there may well be a substantial increase in the customer's mobile data use, for which the network may not have budgeted in their network design and pricing structures.

Some network-provided devices have carrier-specific software that may deny the inbuilt tethering ability normally available on the device, or only enable it if the subscriber pays an additional fee. Some operators have asked [[Google]] or any mobile device producer using Android to completely remove tethering support from the operating system on certain devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/blog/wireless/articles/20110711/17464515050/you-dont-own-what-you-thought-you-bought-verizon-breaks-phones-turns-off-feature.shtml|title=You Don't Own What You Thought You Bought: Verizon Breaks Phones; Turns Off Feature|author=|date=|website=techdirt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Handsets purchased [[SIM-free]], without a network provider subsidy, are often unhindered with regards to tethering.

There are, however, several ways to enable tethering on restricted devices without paying the carrier for it, including 3rd party USB Tethering apps such as PDAnet, [[rooting (Android OS)|rooting Android devices]] or [[iOS Jailbreaking|jailbreaking iOS devices]] and installing a tethering application on the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.androidcentral.com/android-internet-tether |website=www.androidcentral.com |title=Android 101: Tethering |author=Jerry Hildenbrand |date=May 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tethering is also available as a downloadable third-party application on most [[Symbian]] mobile phones&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joiku.com|title=JoikuSpot WiFi|first=|last=Joiku|date=|website=www.joiku.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as on the [[MeeGo]] platform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joikusoft.com/|title=JoikuSpot WiFi|first=|last=Joiku|date=|website=www.joikusoft.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[WebOS]] mobiles phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webos-internals.org/wiki/Application:FreeTether|title=Application:FreeTether - WebOS Internals|author=|date=|website=www.webos-internals.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In carriers' contracts==
{{globalise/US|date=December 2012}}

Depending on the wireless carrier, a user's [[cellular network|cellular]] device may have restricted functionality. While tethering may be allowed at no extra cost, some carriers impose a one-time charge to enable tethering and others forbid tethering or impose added data charges. Contracts that advertise "unlimited" data usage often have limits detailed in a [[Fair usage policy]].

=== United Kingdom ===
In the UK, two tethering-permitted mobile plans offered unlimited data: ''The Full Monty''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davies|first=Chris|title=T-Mobile UK "Full Monty" plan offers true unlimited voice, calls, data, tethering|url=http://www.slashgear.com/t-mobile-uk-full-monty-plan-offers-true-unlimited-voice-calls-data-tethering-30211189/|work=Slash Gear|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  on [[T-Mobile (UK)|T-Mobile]], and ''The One Plan'' on [[Hutchison 3G|Three]]. Three offered tethering as a standard feature until early 2012, retaining it on selected plans. T-Mobile dropped tethering on its unlimited data plans in late 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woods|first=Ben|title=T-Mobile quietly removes tethering for its unlimited data plans|url=http://www.zdnet.com/t-mobile-quietly-removes-tethering-for-its-unlimited-data-plans-7000003081/|work=Slash Gear|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{update|section|date=June 2015}}
As cited in [[Sprint Nextel]]'s "Terms of Service":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Except with Phone-as-Modem plans, you may not use a mobile device (including a Bluetooth device) as a modem in connection with any computer. We reserve the right to deny or terminate service without notice for any misuse or any use that adversely affects network performance.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=Sprint Terms &amp; Conditions - US|url= http://shop.sprint.com/en/legal/legal_terms_privacy_popup.shtml?ECID=vanity:termsandconditions#3 |publisher=sprint.com |accessdate=2010-10-13
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[T-Mobile USA]] has a similar clause in its "Terms &amp; Conditions": 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Unless explicitly permitted by your Data Plan, other uses, including for example, using your Device as a modem or tethering your Device to a personal computer or other hardware, are not permitted.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=T-Mobile Terms &amp; Conditions - US|url=http://www.t-mobile.com/Templates/Popup.aspx?PAsset=Ftr_Ftr_TermsAndConditions&amp;print=true|publisher=t-mobile.com|accessdate=2011-03-14
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

T-Mobile's Simple Family or Simple Business plans offer "Hotspot" from devices that offer that function (such as Apple iPhone) to up to 5 devices. Since 2014-03-27, 1000 MB/month is free in the USA with cellular service. The host device has unlimited slow internet for the rest of the month, and all month while roaming in 100 countries, but with no tethering. For $10 or $20/month more per host device, the amount of data available for tethering can be increased markedly. The host device cellular services can be canceled, added, or changed at any time, pro-rated, data tethering levels can be changed month-to-month, and T-Mobile no longer requires any long-term service contracts, allowing users to bring their own devices or buy devices from them, independent of whether they continue service with them.

{{As of | 2013}} [[Verizon Wireless]] and [[AT&amp;T Mobility]] offer wired tethering to their plans for a fee, while Sprint Nextel offers a Wi-Fi connected "mobile hotspot" tethering feature at an added charge. However, actions by the FCC and a small claims court in California may make it easier for consumers to tether. On July 31, 2012, the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] released an unofficial announcement of Commission action, decreeing Verizon Wireless must pay US$1.25 million to resolve the investigation regarding compliance of the C Block Spectrum (see [[United States 2008 wireless spectrum auction|US Wireless Spectrum Auction of 2008]]).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=Verizon Pays $1.25MM for Blocking Mobile Broadband Applications|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2012/db0731/DOC-315501A1.pdf|accessdate= 22 August 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
The announcement also stated that "(Verizon) recently revised its service offerings such that consumers on usage-based pricing plans may tether, using any application, without paying an additional fee."  After that judgement Verizon release "Share Everything" plans that enable tethering, however users must drop old plans they were grandfathered under (such as the Unlimited Data plans) and switch, or pay a tethering fee.

In another instance, Judge Russell Nadel awarded AT&amp;T customer Matt Spaccarelli US$850 via the Ventura Superior Court, despite the fact that Spaccarelli had violated his terms of service by [[IOS jailbreaking|jailbreaking]] his iPhone in order to fully utilize his iPhone's hardware. Spaccarelli demonstrated that AT&amp;T had unfairly throttled his data connection. His data shows that AT&amp;T had been throttling his connection after approximately 2GB of data was used.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web|last=Spaccarella|first=Matt|title=Matt Spaccarelli's Personal Web Page|url=http://www.taporc.com|accessdate=22 August 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Spaccarelli responded by creating a personal web page in order to provide information that allows others to file a similar lawsuit, commenting :

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hopefully with all this concrete data and the courts on our side, AT&amp;T will be forced to change something. Let’s just hope it chooses to go the way of Sprint, not T-Mobile.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web|last=Hugo|first=Brendan|title=AT&amp;T’s throttling is nothing more than a ploy according to study, California judge Page|url=http://anythingbutiphone.com/15179|accessdate=22 August 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While T-Mobile did eventually allow tethering, on August 31, 2015 the company announced it will punish users who abuse its unlimited data by violating T-Mobile's rules on tethering (which unlike standard data does carry a 7 [[Gigabyte|GB]] cap before [[Throttling process (computing)|throttling]] takes effect) by permanently kicking them off the unlimited plans and making users sign up for tiered data plans. T-Mobile mentioned that it was only a small handful of users who abused the tethering rules by using an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app that masks T-Mobile's tethering monitoring and uses as much as 2 [[Terabyte|TB]]'s per month, causing speed issues for most customers who don't abuse the rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/31/9230595/t-mobile-unlimited-data-tethering-warning|title=T-Mobile will now punish customers who abuse unlimited data|author=|date=|website=theverge.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''trust''' is a three-party [[fiduciary]] relationship in which the first party, the [[settlor|trustor or settlor]], transfers ("settles") a property (often but not necessarily a sum of money) upon the second party (the [[trustee]]) for the benefit of the third party, the [[beneficiary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trust|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/trust.html|website=BusinessDictionary|publisher=WebFinance, Inc.|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A ''testamentary trust'' is created by a will and arises after the death of the settlor.  An '''''inter vivos'' trust''' is created during the settlor's lifetime by a trust instrument. A trust may be '''revocable''' or '''irrevocable'''; in the United States, a trust is presumed to be irrevocable unless the instrument or will creating it states it is revocable, except in California, Oklahoma and Texas, in which trusts are presumed to be revocable until the instrument or will creating them states they are irrevocable. An irrevocable trust can be "broken" (revoked) only by a judicial proceeding.

Trusts and similar relationships have existed since [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times.&lt;ref name="39 U. Colo. L. Rev. 177 (1966-1967)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Scott|first=Austin|title=Importance of the Trust|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/ucollr39&amp;div=16&amp;id=&amp;page=|publisher=U. Colo. L. Rev.|accessdate=6 April 2014|quote=The greatest and most distinctive achievement performed by Englishmen in the field of jurisprudence is the development from century to century of the trust idea.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trustee is the legal owner of the property in trust, as fiduciary for the beneficiary or beneficiaries who is/are the equitable owner(s) of the trust property.  Trustees thus have a fiduciary duty to manage the trust to the benefit of the equitable owners.  They must provide a regular accounting of trust income and expenditures. Trustees may be compensated and be reimbursed their expenses.  A [[court]] of competent jurisdiction can remove a trustee who breaches his/her fiduciary duty.  Some breaches of fiduciary duty can be charged and tried as criminal offences in a court of law.

A trustee can be a [[natural person]], a [[company|business entity]] or a [[public body]]. A trust in the United States may be subject to federal and state taxation.

A trust is created by a [[settlor]], who transfers title to some or all of his or her property to a [[trustee]], who then holds title to that property in trust for the benefit of the [[beneficiary (trust)|beneficiaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Restatment of Trusts |edition=Third |location=St. Paul, Minn. |publisher=American Law Institute |year=1992 |chapter=Section 2 |page=17 |isbn=9780314842466 |oclc=25422858 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trust is governed by the [[Contractual term|terms]] under which it was created. In most [[jurisdiction]]s, this requires a [[contract]]ual trust agreement or [[deed]]. It is possible for a single individual to assume the role of more than one of these parties, and for multiple individuals to share a single role.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}   For example, in a '''living trust''' it is common for the grantor to be both a trustee and a lifetime beneficiary while naming other contingent beneficiaries.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Trusts have existed since [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times and have become one of the most important innovations in [[property law]].&lt;ref name="39 U. Colo. L. Rev. 177 (1966-1967)"/&gt;   Trust law has evolved through court rulings differently in different states, so statements in this article are generalizations; understanding the jurisdiction-specific case law involved is tricky. Some U.S. states are adapting the [[Uniform Trust Code]] to codify and harmonize their trust laws, but state-specific variations still remain.
 
An owner placing property into trust turns over part of his or her [[bundle of rights]] to the trustee, separating the property's legal [[ownership]] and control from its equitable ownership and benefits. This may be done for [[Tax avoidance|tax reasons]] or to control the property and its benefits if the settlor is absent, [[Capacity (law)|incapacitated]], or deceased. [[Testamentary trust]]s may be created in [[Will and testament|wills]], defining how money and property will be handled for children or other beneficiaries.

While the trustee is given legal title to the trust property, in accepting the property title, the trustee owes a number of [[fiduciary duties]] to the beneficiaries.  The primary duties owed include the [[duty of loyalty]], the [[Duty of Prudence|duty of prudence]], the [[duty of impartiality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Restatment of Trusts |edition=Third |location=St. Paul, Minn. |publisher=American Law Institute |year=1992 |chapter=Chapter 15 |page=67 |isbn=9780314842466 |oclc=25422858}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trustee may be held to a very high standard of care in their dealings, in order to enforce their behavior. To ensure beneficiaries receive their due, trustees are subject to a number of ancillary duties in support of the primary duties, including a duties of [[openness]] and [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]]; duties of [[recordkeeping]], [[accounting]], and [[Convention of disclosure|disclosure]].  In addition, a trustee has a duty to know, understand, and abide by the terms of the trust and relevant law. The trustee may be compensated and have expenses reimbursed, but otherwise must turn over all [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] from the trust properties.

There are strong restrictions regarding a trustee with [[conflict of interests]]. [[Court]]s can reverse a trustee's actions, order profits returned, and impose other sanctions if they finds a trustee has failed in any of their duties. Such a failure is termed a [[breach of trust (civil wrong)|breach of trust]] and can leave a neglectful or dishonest trustee with severe liabilities for their failures. It is highly advisable for both settlors and trustees to seek qualified legal counsel prior to entering into a trust agreement.

==History==
{{main|History of trusts}}

===Ancient examples===
A possible early concept which later developed into what today is understood as a trust related to land. An ancient king (settlor) grants property back to its previous owner (beneficiary) during his absence, supported by witness testimony (trustee). In essence and in this case, the king, in place of the later state (trustor and holder of assets at highest position) issues ownership along with past proceeds to the original beneficiary:
{{quote | ''On the testimony of Gehazi the servant of Elisha that the woman was the owner of these lands, the king returns all her property to her. From the fact that the king orders his eunuch to return to the woman all her property and the produce of her land from the time that she left...''&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Barak, Zafrira. "Meribaal and the System of Land Grants in Ancient Israel." Biblica (1981): 73-91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===English common law===
[[Roman law]] had a well-developed concept of the trust (''[[fideicommissum]]'') in terms of "testamentary trusts" created by [[will (law)|wills]] but never developed the concept of the ''inter vivos'' (living) trusts which apply while the creator lives. This was created by later common law jurisdictions. Personal trust law [[History of equity and trusts#Middle Ages|developed in England]] at the time of the [[Crusades]], during the 12th and 13th centuries. In medieval English trust law, the settlor was known as the ''feoffor'' to uses while the trustee was known as the ''[[feoffee]]'' to uses and the beneficiary was known as the ''[[cestui que]]'' use, or ''cestui que'' trust.

At the time, land ownership in England was based on the [[feudal system]]. When a landowner left England to fight in the Crusades, he conveyed ownership of his lands in his absence to manage the estate and pay and receive feudal dues, on the understanding that the ownership would be conveyed back on his return. However, Crusaders often encountered refusal to hand over the property upon their return. Unfortunately for the Crusader, English common law did not recognize his claim. As far as the King's courts were concerned, the land belonged to the trustee, who was under no obligation to return it. The Crusader had no legal claim. The disgruntled Crusader would then petition the king, who would refer the matter to his [[Lord Chancellor]]. The Lord Chancellor could decide a case according to his conscience. At this time, the principle of [[Equity (law)|equity]] was born.

The Lord Chancellor would consider it "unconscionable" that the legal owner could go back on his word and deny the claims of the Crusader (the "true" owner). Therefore, he would find in favour of the returning Crusader. Over time, it became known that the Lord Chancellor's court (the Court of Chancery) would continually recognize the claim of a returning Crusader. The legal owner would hold the land for the benefit of the original owner and would be compelled to convey it back to him when requested. The Crusader was the "beneficiary" and the acquaintance the "trustee". The term "use of land" was coined, and in time developed into what we now know as a ''trust''.

==Significance==
The trust is widely considered to be the most innovative contribution of the [[English law|English legal system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goode|first1=Roy M.|title=Commercial Law|date=2 January 1996|publisher=Penguin UK|location=London, U.K.|isbn=0140125345|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify-inline|concern=Can someone verify if this source says i) it is the most innovative contribution, ii) or that it is widely considered the most innovative contribution, or iii) none of the above?|date=September 2015}} Today, trusts play a significant role in most [[common law]] systems, and their success has led some [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions to incorporate trusts into their [[civil code]]s. In [[Curaçao]], for example, the trust was enacted into law on 1 January 2012; however, the Curaçao Civil Code only allows express trusts constituted by [[Act (document)|notarial instrument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cifa-curacao.com/pdfdocuments/WPNR%202012-6926%20De%20Boer.pdf|title=De Curaçaose trust in de partijk|language=Dutch|author=M. Bergervoet and D.S. Mansur|date=14 April 2012|journal=Weekblad voor Privaatrecht, Notariaat en Registratie}}&lt;/ref&gt; France has recently added a similar, Roman-law-based device to its own law with the ''fiducie'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Loi n°2007-211 du 19 février 2007 instituant la fiducie | url = http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000821047&amp;dateTexte= | date = 1 February 2009 | publisher = Legifrance.gouv.fr, le service public de la diffusion du droit}}&lt;/ref&gt; amended in 2009;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ordonnance n°2009-79 du 22 janvier 2009 (consolidated version) | url = http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000821047&amp;dateTexte= |date = 1 February 2009 | publisher = Legifrance.gouv.fr, le service public de la diffusion du droit}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''fiducie'', unlike a trust, is a contractual relationship. Trusts are widely used internationally, especially in countries within the [[English law]] sphere of influence, and whilst most civil law jurisdictions do not generally contain the concept of a trust within their legal systems, they do recognise the concept under the [[Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition]] (partly only the extent that they are parties thereto). The Hague Convention also regulates [[trusts (conflict)|conflict of trusts]].

Although trusts are often associated with intrafamily wealth transfers, they have become very important in American capital markets, particularly through pension funds (in certain countries essentially always trusts) and mutual funds (often trusts).&lt;ref name=Hansmann1998&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hansmann |first=Henry | last2= Mattei |first2= Ugo | date = May 1998 | format = PDF | url = http://www.nyulawreview.org/sites/default/files/pdf/NYULawReview-73-2-Hansmann-Mattei.pdf |title = The Functions of Trust Law: A Comparative Legal and Economic Analysis | journal = New York University Law Review | accessdate = 17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic principles==
Property of any sort may be held in a trust. The uses of trusts are many and varied, for both personal and commercial reasons, and trusts may provide benefits in [[estate planning]], [[asset protection]], and [[tax]]es. Living trusts may be created during a person's life (through the drafting of a [[trust instrument]]) or after death in a [[will (law)|will]].

In a relevant sense, a trust can be viewed as a generic form of a corporation where the settlors (investors) are also the beneficiaries. This is particularly evident in the Delaware business trust, which could theoretically, with the language in the "[[Articles of Incorporation|governing instrument]]", be organized as a [[cooperative]] corporation or a limited liability corporation,&lt;ref name=Hansmann1998/&gt;{{rp|475–6}} although traditionally the [[Massachusetts business trust]] has been commonly used in the US. One of the most significant aspects of trusts is the ability to partition and shield assets from the trustee, multiple beneficiaries, and their respective creditors (particularly the trustee's creditors), making it "[[bankruptcy remote]]", and leading to its use in pensions, mutual funds, and asset [[securitization]]&lt;ref name=Hansmann1998/&gt; as well protection of individual [[spendthrift]]s through the [[spendthrift trust]].

===Terminology===
[[File:Chart of a trust.jpg|thumb|Chart of a trust]]
* Appointer: This is the person who can appoint a new trustee or remove an existing one. This person is usually mentioned in the trust deed.
* Appointment: In trust law, "appointment" often has its everyday meaning. It is common to talk of "the appointment of a trustee", for example. However, "appointment" also has a technical trust law meaning, either:
** the act of 'appointing' (i.e. giving) an asset from the trust to a beneficiary (usually where there is some choice in the matter—such as in a discretionary trust); or
** the name of the document which gives effect to the appointment.
:The trustee's right to do this, where it exists, is called a [[power of appointment]]. Sometimes, a power of appointment is given to someone other than the trustee, such as the settlor, the protector, or a beneficiary.

* 'As Trustee For' ('''ATF'''): This is the legal term used to imply that an entity is acting as a trustee.
* [[Beneficiary (trust)|Beneficiary]]: A beneficiary is anyone who receives benefits from any assets the trust owns.
* 'In Its Own Capacity' (IIOC): This term refers to the fact that the trustee is acting on its own behalf.
* [[Protector (trust)|Protector]]: A protector may be appointed in an express, ''inter vivos'' trust, as a person who has some control over the trustee—usually including a power to dismiss the trustee and appoint another. The legal status of a protector is the subject of some debate. No-one doubts that a ''trustee'' has [[fiduciary]] responsibilities. If a ''protector'' also has fiduciary responsibilities, then the courts—if asked by beneficiaries—could order him or her to act in the way the court decrees. However, a protector is unnecessary to the nature of a trust—many trusts can and do operate without one. Also, protectors are comparatively new, while the nature of trusts has been established over hundreds of years. It is therefore thought by some that protectors have fiduciary duties, and by others that they do not. The [[case law]] has not yet established this point.
* [[Settlor]](s): This is the person (or persons) who creates the trust. Grantor(s) is a common synonym.
* Terms of the Trust means the settlor's wishes expressed in the Trust Instrument.
* [[Trust instrument|Trust deed]]: A trust deed is a legal document that defines the trust such as the trustee, beneficiaries, settlor and appointer, and the terms and conditions of the agreement.
* Trust distributions: A trust distribution is any income or asset that is given out to the beneficiaries of the trust.
* Trustee: A person (either an individual, a corporation or more than one of either) who administers a trust. A trustee is considered a [[fiduciary]] and owes the highest duty under the law to protect trust assets from unreasonable loss for the trust's beneficiaries.

===Creation===
Trusts may be created by the expressed intentions of the settlor ([[express trust]]s)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westlaw.com.au.wwwproxy0.library.unsw.edu.au/maf/wlau/app/document?docguid=I896d6d3213d411e18eefa443f89988a0&amp;tocDs=AUNZ_CASES_TOC&amp;isTocNav=true&amp;startChunk=1&amp;endChunk=1 |title=Database Access - UNSW Library |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or they may be created by operation of law known as implied trusts. An [[implied trust]] is one created by a court of equity because of acts or situations of the parties. Implied trusts are divided into two categories: resulting and constructive. A [[resulting trust]] is implied by the law to work out the presumed intentions of the parties, but it does not take into consideration their expressed intent. A [[constructive trust]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1988/16.html|title=Bahr v Nicolay (No 2) [1988] HCA 16; (1988) 164 CLR 604 (15 June 1988) |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a trust implied by law to work out justice between the parties, regardless of their intentions.

Typically a trust can be created in the following four ways:
# a written [[trust instrument]] created by the settlor and signed by both the settlor and the trustees (often referred to as an ''inter vivos'' or living trust);
# an oral declaration;&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''[[T Choithram International SA v Pagarani|T Choithram International SA and others v Pagarani and others]]'' [2001] 2 All ER 492&lt;/ref&gt;
# the [[Will (law)|will]] of a decedent, usually called a [[testamentary trust]]; or
# a court order (for example in family proceedings).

In some jurisdictions certain types of assets may not be the subject of a trust without a written document.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in England, trusts over land must be evidenced in writing under s.56 of the Law of Property Act 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formalities===
{{main article|Three certainties}}
The formalities required of a trust depends on the type of trust in question.

Generally, a private express trust requires three elements to be certain, which together are known as the "three certainties". These elements were determined in ''[[Knight v Knight]]'' to be intention, subject matter and objects.&lt;ref name="GlisterLee2015ch4"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Glister |first1=James |last2=Lee |first2=James |title=Hanbury and Martin: Modern Equity |date=2015 |publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]] |isbn=9780414032408 |edition=20 |chapter=Certainty and Capacity}}&lt;/ref&gt; The certainty of intention allows the court to ascertain a settlor's true reason for creating the trust. The certainties of subject matter and objects allow the court to administer trust when the trustees fail to do so.&lt;ref name="Doulton"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=[[McPhail v Doulton]] |vol= [1970]|reporter=UKHL 1|opinion= |pinpoint=|court=|date=|url=|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court determines whether there is sufficient certainty by construing the words used in the trust instrument. These words are construed objectively in their "reasonable meaning",&lt;ref name="Re Gulbenkian"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=[[Re Gulbenkian's Settlements Trusts]] |vol= [1968]|reporter=UKHL 5|opinion= |pinpoint=|court=|date=|url=|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; within the context of the entire instrument.&lt;ref name="GlisterLee2015ch4"/&gt; Despite intention being integral to express trusts, the court will try not to let trusts fail for the lack of certainty.&lt;ref name="Re Hays"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Re Hay's Settlement Trusts |vol= [1981] 3|reporter=All ER 786|opinion= |pinpoint=|court=|date=|url=|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Intention. A mere expression of hope that a trust be created does not constitute an intention to create a trust. Conversely, the existence of terms of art or the word "trust" does not indicate whether an instrument is an express trust.&lt;ref name="GlisterLee2015ch4"/&gt; Disputes in this area mainly concerns differentiating gifts from trusts. 
# Subject Matter. The property subject to the trust must be clearly identified (''Palmer v Simmonds''). One may not, for example state, settle "the majority of my estate", as the precise extent cannot be ascertained. Trust property may be any form of specific property, be it [[real property|real]] or [[personal property|personal]], [[tangible property|tangible]] or [[intangible property|intangible]]. It is often, for example, real estate, shares or cash.
# Objects. The beneficiaries of the trust must be clearly identified,&lt;ref name="Doulton"/&gt; or at least be ascertainable (''Re Hain's Settlement''). In the case of discretionary trusts, where the trustees have power to decide who the beneficiaries will be, the settlor must have described a clear class of beneficiaries (''[[McPhail v Doulton]]''). Beneficiaries may include people not born at the date of the trust (for example, "my future grandchildren"). Alternatively, the object of a trust could be a charitable purpose rather than specific beneficiaries.

===Trustees===
A trust may have multiple trustees, and these trustees are the legal owners of the trust's property, but have a [[fiduciary]] duty to beneficiaries and various duties, such as a duty of care and a duty to inform.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Jones Trust Company. [http://www.edwardjones.com/groups/ejw_content/documents/document/web043726.pdf Fundamental Duties of a Trustee: A Guide for Trustees in a post-Uniform Trust Code World].&lt;/ref&gt; If trustees do not adhere to these duties, they may be removed through a legal action. The trustee may be either a [[natural person|person]] or a [[Juristic person|legal entity]] such as a [[company]], but typically the trust itself is not an entity and any lawsuit must be against the trustees. A trustee has many rights and responsibilities which vary based on the jurisdiction and trust instrument. If a trust lacks a trustee, a court may appoint a trustee.

The trustees administer the affairs attendant to the trust. The trust's affairs may include prudently investing the assets of the trust, accounting for and reporting periodically to the beneficiaries, filing required tax returns and other duties. In some cases dependent upon the trust instrument, the trustees must make discretionary decisions as to whether beneficiaries should receive trust assets for their benefit. A trustee may be held personally liable for problems, although fiduciary liability insurance similar to [[directors and officers liability insurance]] can be purchased. For example, a trustee could be liable if assets are not properly invested. In addition, a trustee may be liable to its beneficiaries even where the trust has made a profit but consent has not been given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trusts.it/admincp/UploadedPDF/200801171738350.jEnghouseBoardmanPhipps19661103.pdf|title=Boardman v Phipps [1966&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; UKHL 2|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the United States, similar to directors and officers, an [[waiver|exculpatory clause]] may minimize liability; although this was previously held to be against public policy, this position has changed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/rpte_ereport/2009/june/te_robert_sacks.authcheckdam.pdf Last Beneficiary Standing: Identifying the Proper Parties in Breach of Fiduciary Cases]. American Bar Association, Section of Real Property, Trust, &amp; Estate Law. 20th Annual Real Property &amp; Estate Planning Symposia.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[Uniform Trust Code]] provides for reasonable compensation and reimbursement for trustees subject to review by courts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://uniformlaws.org/ActSummary.aspx?title=Trust%20Code Trust Code Summary]. Uniform Law Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; although trustees may be unpaid. Commercial banks acting as trustees typically charge about 1% of assets under management.&lt;ref&gt;Schanzenbach MM, Sitkoff RF. (2007). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=868761 Did Reform of Prudent Trust Investment Laws Change Trust Portfolio Allocation?]. Harvard Law School John M. Olin Center for Law, Economics and Business Discussion Paper Series. Paper 580.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beneficiaries===
The beneficiaries are beneficial (or 'equitable') owners of the trust property. Either immediately or eventually, the beneficiaries will receive income from the trust property, or they will receive the property itself. The extent of a beneficiary's interest depends on the wording of the trust document. One beneficiary may be entitled to income (for example, interest from a bank account), whereas another may be entitled to the entirety of the trust property when he attains the age of twenty-five years. The settlor has much discretion when creating the trust, subject to some limitations imposed by law.

The use of trusts as a means to inherit substantial wealth may be associated with some negative connotations; some beneficiaries who are able to live comfortably from trust proceeds without having to work a job may be jokingly referred to as "trust fund babies" (regardless of age) or "trustafarians".&lt;ref name="martinez18"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martinez |first1=Michael J. |title=Vault Career Guide to Private Wealth Management |date=2007 |publisher=Vault, Inc. |location=New York, New York |isbn=9781581314489 |oclc=86069641 |page=18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cuseaZWNAvUC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22trust+fund+baby%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwus6ntqfSAhUMLcAKHaLeDtYQ6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22trust%20fund%20baby%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purposes==
Common purposes for trusts include:
* Privacy: Trusts may be created purely for privacy. The terms of a will are public in certain jurisdictions, while the terms of a trust are not. 
* [[Spendthrift trust|Spendthrift clauses]]: Trusts may be used to protect beneficiaries (for example, one's children) against their own inability to handle money. These are especially attractive for [[spendthrift]]s. Courts may generally recognize spendthrift clauses against trust beneficiaries and their creditors, but not against creditors of a settlor.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}
* Wills and estate planning: Trusts frequently appear in [[Will (law)|wills]] (indeed, technically, the administration of every deceased's estate is a form of trust). Conventional wills typically leave assets to the deceased's spouse (if any), and then to the children equally. If the children are under 18, or under some other age mentioned in the will (21 and 25 are common), a trust must come into existence until the 'contingency age' is reached. The executor of the will is (usually) the trustee, and the children are the beneficiaries. The trustee will have powers to assist the beneficiaries during their minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Frequently Asked Questions |url = http://scottrosenberglaw.com/faq.html#Trusts | first = Scott D. | last = Rosenberg | date = 2009–2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Charities: In some common law jurisdictions all charities must take the form of trusts. In others, [[corporation]]s may be charities also. In most jurisdictions, charities are tightly regulated for the public benefit (in England, for example, by the [[Charity Commission]]).
* Unit trusts: The trust has proved to be such a flexible concept that it has proved capable of working as an investment vehicle: the [[unit trust]].
* [[Pension]] plans: typically set up as a trust, with the employer as settlor, and the employees and their dependents as beneficiaries.
* Remuneration trusts: for the benefit of directors and employees or companies or their families or dependents. This form of trust was developed by Paul Baxendale-Walker and has since gained widespread use.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul BW Chaplin#Biography]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Corporate structures: Complex business arrangements, most often in the finance and insurance sectors, sometimes use trusts among various other entities (e.g., corporations) in their structure.
* [[Asset protection]]: Trusts may allow beneficiaries to protect assets from creditors as the trust may be [[bankruptcy remote]]. For example, a discretionary trust, of which the settlor may be the protector and a beneficiary, but not the trustee and not the sole beneficiary. In such an arrangement the settlor may be in a position to benefit from the trust assets, without owning them, and therefore in theory protected from creditors. In addition, the trust may attempt to preserve anonymity with a completely unconnected name (e.g., "The Teddy Bear Trust"). These strategies are ethically and legally controversial.
* Tax planning: The tax consequences of doing anything using a trust are usually different from the tax consequences of achieving the same effect by another route (if, indeed, it would be possible to do so). In many cases, the tax consequences of using the trust are better than the alternative, and trusts are therefore frequently used for legal [[Tax avoidance/evasion|tax avoidance]]. For an example see the "nil-band discretionary trust", explained at [[Inheritance Tax (United Kingdom)]].
* [[Concurrent estate|Co-ownership]]: Ownership of property by more than one person is facilitated by a trust. In particular, ownership of a matrimonial home is commonly effected by a trust with both partners as beneficiaries and one, or both, owning the legal title as trustee.
* [[Construction law]]: In Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Construction law: Breach of trust in the construction industry |url = http://www.iflr.com/Article/1984910/Channel/193438/Construction-law-Breach-of-trust-in-the-construction-industry.html |first = Harvey J |last = Kirsh |first2 = Lori A |last2 = Roth |publisher = International Finance Law Review (IFLR) |date = 1 September 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Minnesota monies owed by employers to contractors or by contractors to subcontractors on construction projects must by law be held in trust. In the event of contractor insolvency, this makes it much more likely that subcontractors will be paid for work completed.
* [[Legal retainer]]- Lawyers in certain countries often require that a legal retainer be paid upfront and held in trust until such time as the legal work is performed and billed to the client, this serves as a minimum guarantee of remuneration should the client become insolvent.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} However, strict legal ethical codes apply to the use of legal retainer trusts.

==Types==
===Alphabetic list of trust types===
Trusts go by many different names, depending on the characteristics or the purpose of the trust. Because trusts often have multiple characteristics or purposes, a single trust might accurately be described in several ways. For example, a living trust is often an express trust, which is also a revocable trust, and might include an incentive trust, and so forth.
* [[Asset-protection trust]]: The concept of an asset-protection trust encompasses any form of trust that provides for funds to be held on a [[discretionary trust|discretionary basis]]. Such trusts are set up in an attempt to avoid or mitigate the effects of [[taxation]], [[divorce]] and [[bankruptcy]] on the beneficiary. Such trusts may be proscribed or limited in their effect by governments and the courts.
* [[Community land trust]]: A community land trust is a nonprofit corporation that develops and stewards affordable housing, community gardens, civic buildings, commercial spaces and other community assets on behalf of a community. “CLTs” balance the needs of individuals to access land and maintain security of tenure with a community’s need to maintain affordability, economic diversity and local access to essential services.
* [[Constructive trust]]: Unlike an express trust, a constructive trust is not created by an agreement between a settlor and the trustee. A constructive trust is imposed by the law as an "equitable remedy". This generally occurs due to some wrongdoing, where the wrongdoer has acquired legal title to some property and cannot in good conscience be allowed to benefit from it. A constructive trust is, essentially, a [[legal fiction]]. For example, a court of equity recognizing a plaintiff's request for the equitable remedy of a constructive trust may decide that a constructive trust has been created and simply order the person holding the assets to deliver them to the person who rightfully should have them. The constructive trustee is not necessarily the person who is guilty of the wrongdoing, and in practice it is often a bank or similar organization. The distinction may be finer than the preceding exposition in that there are also said to be two forms of constructive trust, the institutional constructive trust and the remedial constructive trust. The latter is an "equitable remedy" imposed by law being truly remedial; the former arising due to some defect in the transfer of property.
* [[Discretionary trust]]: In a discretionary trust, certainty of object is satisfied if it can be said that there is a criterion which a person must satisfy in order to be a beneficiary (i.e., whether there is a 'class' of beneficiaries, which a person can be said to belong to). In that way, persons who satisfy that criterion (who are members of that class) can enforce the trust. ''[[Re Baden’s Deed Trusts (no 2)|Re Baden’s Deed Trusts]]''; ''[[McPhail v Doulton]]''
* Directed trust: In these types, a ''directed trustee'' is directed by a number of other trust participants in implementing the trust's execution; these participants may include a distribution committee, trust protector, or investment advisor. The directed trustee's role is administrative which involves following investment instructions, holding legal title to the trust assets, providing fiduciary and tax accounting, coordinating trust participants and offering dispute resolution among the participants
* Dynasty trust (also known as a 'generation-skipping trust'): A type of trust in which assets are passed down to the grantor's grandchildren, not the grantor's children. The children of the grantor never take title to the assets. This allows the grantor to avoid the estate taxes that would apply if the assets were transferred to his or her children first. Generation-skipping trusts can still be used to provide financial benefits to a grantor's children, however, because any income generated by the trust's assets can be made accessible to the grantor's children while still leaving the assets in trust for the grandchildren.
* [[Express trust]]: An express trust arises where a settlor deliberately and consciously decides to create a trust, over their assets, either now, or upon his or her later death. In these cases this will be achieved by signing a trust instrument, which will either be a [[Will (law)|will]] or a trust deed. Almost all trusts dealt with in the trust industry are of this type. They contrast with resulting and constructive trusts. The intention of the parties to create the trust must be shown clearly by their language or conduct. For an express trust to exist, there must be certainty to the objects of the trust and the trust property. In the USA [[Statute of frauds|Statute of Frauds]] provisions require express trusts to be evidenced in writing if the trust property is above a certain value, or is real estate.
* '''Fixed trust''': The entitlement of the beneficiaries is fixed by the settlor. The trustee has little or no discretion. Common examples are:
** a trust for a minor ("to x if she attains 21");
** a 'life interest' ("to pay the [[income]] to x for her lifetime"); and
** a 'remainder' ("to pay the [[Capital (economics)|capital]] to y after the death of x")
* [[Grantor retained annuity trust]] ('GRAT'): an irrevocable trust whereby a grantor transfers asset(s), as a gift, into a trust and receives an annual payment from the trust for a period of time specified in the trust instrument. At the end of the term, the financial property is transferred (tax-free) to the named beneficiaries. This trust is commonly used in the U.S. to facilitate large financial gifts that are not subject to a '[[gift tax]]'.
* Hybrid trust: Combines elements of both fixed and discretionary trusts. In a hybrid trust, the trustee must pay a certain amount of the trust property to each beneficiary fixed by the settlor. But the trustee has discretion as to how any remaining trust property, once these fixed amounts have been paid out, is to be paid to the beneficiaries.
* Implied trust: as distinct from an express trust, is created where some of the legal requirements for an express trust are not met, but an intention on behalf of the parties to create a trust can be presumed to exist. A resulting trust may be deemed to be present where a trust instrument is not properly drafted and a portion of the equitable title has not been provided for. In such a case, the law may raise a resulting trust for the benefit of the grantor (the creator of the trust). In other words, the grantor may be deemed to be a beneficiary of the portion of the equitable title that was not properly provided for in the trust document.
* '''Improvement trust''': can be set up by urban or local government to hold funds for the development or improvement of an area. The trust is often run by a committee, and can act similarly to a [[Urban planning|development agency]], depending on the provisions of its charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Public Administration: Institutions and Issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nvzcy7o4sgAC&amp;pg=PA271|accessdate=2 January 2017|year=1995|publisher=New Age International|isbn=978-81-7328-068-9|pages=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Incentive trust]]: A trust that uses distributions from income or principal as an incentive to encourage or discourage certain behaviors on the part of the beneficiary. The term "incentive trust" is sometimes used to distinguish trusts that provide fixed conditions for access to '''trust funds''' from discretionary trusts that leave such decisions up to the trustee.
* ''Inter vivos'' trust (or 'living trust'): A settlor who is living at the time the trust is established creates an ''inter vivos'' trust.
{{Anchor|Irrevocable trust}}
* '''Irrevocable trust''': In contrast to a '''revocable trust''', an irrevocable trust is one in which the terms of the trust cannot be amended or revised until the terms or purposes of the trust have been completed. Although in rare cases, a court may change the terms of the trust due to unexpected changes in circumstances that make the trust uneconomical or unwieldy to administer, under normal circumstances an irrevocable trust may not be changed by the trustee or the beneficiaries of the trust.
* [[Land trust]]: A private, nonprofit organization that, as all or part of its mission, actively works to conserve land by undertaking or assisting in land or conservation easement acquisition, or by its stewardship of such land or easements; or an agreement whereby one party (the trustee) agrees to hold ownership of a piece of real property for the benefit of another party (the beneficiary).
* [[Offshore trust]]: Strictly speaking, an offshore trust is a trust which is [[Residency (domicile)|resident]] in any jurisdiction other than that in which the settlor is resident. However, the term is more commonly used to describe a trust in one of the jurisdictions known as [[Offshore Financial Centre|offshore financial centers]] or, colloquially, as [[tax haven]]s. Offshore trusts are usually conceptually similar to onshore trusts in common law countries, but usually with legislative modifications to make them more commercially attractive by abolishing or modifying certain common law restrictions. By extension, "onshore trust" has come to mean any trust resident in a high-tax jurisdiction.
* [[Personal injury trust]]: A personal injury trust is any form of trust where funds are held by trustees for the benefit of a person who has suffered an injury and funded exclusively by funds derived from payments made in consequence of that injury.
* Private and [[Charitable trust|public trusts]]: A '''private trust''' has one or more particular individuals as its beneficiary. By contrast, a ''public trust'' (also called a ''charitable trust'') has some charitable end as its beneficiary. In order to qualify as a charitable trust, the trust must have as its object certain purposes such as alleviating poverty, providing education, carrying out some religious purpose, etc. The permissible objects are generally set out in legislation, but objects not explicitly set out may also be an object of a charitable trust, by analogy. Charitable trusts are entitled to special treatment under the law of trusts and also the law of taxation.
* Protective trust: Here the terminology is different between the UK and the USA:
** In the UK, a protective trust is a life interest that terminates upon the happening of a specified event; such as the bankruptcy of the beneficiary, or any attempt by an individual to dispose of his or her interest. They have become comparatively rare.
** In the USA, a 'protective trust' is a type of trust that was devised for use in estate planning. (In another jurisdiction this might be thought of as one type of [[asset protection]] trust.) Often a person, ''A'', wishes to leave property to another person ''B''. ''A'', however,  fears that the property might be claimed by creditors before ''A'' dies, and that therefore ''B'' would receive none of it. ''A'' could establish a trust with ''B'' as the beneficiary, but then ''A'' would not be entitled to use of the property before they died. Protective trusts were developed as a solution to this situation. ''A'' would establish a trust with both ''A'' and ''B'' as beneficiaries, with the trustee instructed to allow ''A'' use of the property until they died, and thereafter to allow its use to ''B''. The property is then safe from being claimed by ''A''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; creditors, at least so long as the debt was entered into after the trust's establishment. This use of trusts is similar to [[life estate]]s and [[Remainder (law)|remainders]], and is frequently used as an alternative to them.
* [[Purpose trust]]: Or, more accurately, non-charitable purpose trust (all charitable trusts are purpose trusts). Generally, the law does not permit non-charitable purpose trusts outside of certain anomalous exceptions which arose under the eighteenth century common law (and, arguable, [[Quistclose trust|''Quistclose'' trusts]]). Certain jurisdictions (principally, [[offshore jurisdictions]]) have enacted legislation validating non-charitable purpose trusts generally.
*'''[[QTIP Trust]]''': Short for "qualified terminal interest property."  A trust recognized under the [[Internal Revenue Code|tax laws of the United States]] which qualifies for the marital gift exclusion from the [[Estate tax in the United States|estate tax]].
* [[Resulting trust]]: A resulting trust is a form of implied trust which occurs where (1) a trust fails, wholly or in part, as a result of which the settlor becomes entitled to the assets; or (2) a voluntary payment is made by A to B in circumstances which do not suggest gifting. B becomes the resulting trustee of A's payment.
* Revocable trust: A trust of this kind may be amended, altered or revoked by its settlor at any time, provided the settlor is not mentally incapacitated. Revocable trusts are becoming increasingly common in the US as a substitute for a [[Will (law)|will]] to minimize administrative costs associated with probate and to provide centralized administration of a person's final affairs after death.
* [[Secret trust]]: A ''post mortem'' trust constituted externally from a will but imposing obligations as a trustee on one, or more, legatees of a will.
* [[Semi-secret trust]]: A trust in which a will demonstrates the intention to create a trust, names a trustee, but does not identify the intended beneficiary.&lt;ref&gt;Julius B. Levine &amp; Randall L. Holton, Enforcement of Secret and Semi-Secret Trusts, 5 Prob. L.J. 7, 16 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Simple trust]]:
** In the US jurisdiction this has two distinct meanings:
*** In a simple trust the trustee has no active duty beyond conveying the property to the beneficiary at some future time determined by the trust. This is also called a 'bare trust'. All other trusts are ''special trusts'' where the trustee has active duties beyond this.
*** A simple trust in Federal income tax law is one in which, under the terms of the trust document, all net income must be distributed on an annual basis.
** In the UK a bare or simple trust is one where the beneficiary has an immediate and absolute right to both the capital and income held in the trust. Bare trusts are commonly used to transfer assets to minors. Trustees hold the assets on trust until the beneficiary is 18 in England and Wales, or 16 in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/trusts/types/bare.htm | title = Bare trusts | publisher = HM Revenue &amp; Customs | accessdate = 1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Special trust: In the US, a special trust, also called complex trust, contrasts with a simple trust (see above). It does not require the income be paid out within the subject tax year. The funds from a complex trust can also be used to donate to a charity or for charitable purposes.
* [[SPA Trust|Special Power of Appointment trust]] (SPA Trust): A trust implementing a [[Power of appointment#Special power of appointment|special power of appointment]] to provide [[asset protection]] features.
* [[Spendthrift trust]]: It is a trust put into place for the benefit of a person who is unable to control their spending. It gives the trustee the power to decide how the trust funds may be spent for the benefit of the beneficiary.
* Standby Trust (or 'Pourover Trust)': The trust is empty at creation during life and the will transfers the property into the trust at death. This is a statutory trust.
* Statutory Business Trust: A trust created pursuant to a state's business trust statute used primarily for commercial purposes. Two prominent variants of Statutory Business Trusts are [[Delaware statutory trust]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and [[Massachusetts business trust]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. The [[Uniform Law Commission]] promulgated a final amended draft of the Uniform Statutory Entity Act (2009) in 2013. As of 24 January 2017, no states have adopted the Uniform Statutory Entity Act of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uniformlaws.org/Act.aspx?title=Statutory%20Trust%20Entity%20Act%20(2009)%20(Last%20Amended%202013)|title=Statutory Trust Entity Act (2009) (Last Amended 2013)|website=www.uniformlaws.org|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Testamentary trust]] (or 'Will Trust'): A trust created in an individual's [[will (law)|will]] is called a testamentary trust. Because a will can become effective only upon death, a testamentary trust is generally created at or following the date of the settlor's death.
* [[Unit trust]]: A trust where the beneficiaries (called ''unitholders'') each possess a certain share (called ''units'') and can direct the trustee to pay money to them out of the trust property according to the number of units they possess. A unit trust is a vehicle for [[Investment fund|collective investment]], rather than disposition, as the person who gives the property to the trustee is also the beneficiary.&lt;ref&gt;Kam Fan Sin, The Legal Nature of the Unit Trust, Clarendon Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regional variations ==
Trusts originated in England, and therefore [[English trusts law]] has had a significant influence, particularly among [[common law]] legal systems such as the [[United States]] and the countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].

[[Trust law in civil law jurisdictions]], generally including [[Continental Europe]] only exists in a limited number of jurisdictions (e.g. Curaçao, Liechtenstein and Sint Maarten). The trust may however be recognized as an instrument of foreign law in [[conflict of laws]] cases, for example within the [[Brussels regime]] (Europe) and the parties to the [[Hague Trust Convention]]. Tax avoidance concerns have historically been one of the reasons that European countries with a civil law system have been reluctant to adopt trusts.&lt;ref name=Hansmann1998/&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Main|United States trust law}}
[[State law]] applies to trusts, and the [[Uniform Trust Code]] has been enacted by the legislatures in many states. In addition, federal law considerations such as federal taxes administered by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] may affect the structure and creation of trusts. The common law of trusts is summarized in the [[Restatements of the Law]], such as the Restatement of Trusts, Third (2003−08).

In the United States the tax law allows trusts to be taxed as corporations, partnerships, or not at all depending on the circumstances, although trusts may be used for [[tax avoidance]] in certain situations.&lt;ref name=Hansmann1998/&gt;{{rp|478}} For example, the [[trust-preferred security]] is a hybrid (debt and equity) security with favorable tax treatment which is treated as [[regulatory capital]] on banks' balance sheets. The [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] changed this somewhat by not allowing these assets to be a part of (large) banks' regulatory capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP &amp; Affiliates |url=http://www.skadden.com/Cimages/siteFile/Skadden_Insights_Special_Edition_Dodd-Frank_Act1.pdf |title=The Dodd-Frank Act: Commentary and Insights |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414222136/http://www.skadden.com/Cimages/siteFile/Skadden_Insights_Special_Edition_Dodd-Frank_Act1.pdf |archivedate=14 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}}

==== Estate planning ====
{{Main|Estate planning}}
Living trusts, as opposed to testamentary (will) trusts, may help a trustor avoid [[probate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caraway|first1=David|title=Testamentary Trusts|url=http://www.nycbar.org/get-legal-help/article/wills-trusts-and-elder-law/trusts/testamentary-trusts/|website=New York City Bar|accessdate=14 December 2017|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avoiding probate may save costs and maintain privacy&lt;ref name=expertlaw1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is a Trust and Why You May Need One|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/estate_planning/trusts.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|publisher=ExpertLaw|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and living trusts have become very popular.&lt;ref&gt;American Bar Association. Ch.5 ''[http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/publiced/practical/books/wills/chapter_5.authcheckdam.pdf Living Trusts]''. Appears to be online copy of: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DdDdCfxSxAwC&amp;q The American Bar Association guide to wills and estates]'' (1995). See also [http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/publiced/practical/books/wills/chapter_4.authcheckdam.pdf Ch. 4, Trusts].&lt;/ref&gt; Probate is potentially costly, and probate records are available to the public while distribution through a trust is private. Both living trusts and wills can also be used to plan for unforeseen circumstances such as incapacity or disability, by giving discretionary powers to the trustee or executor of the will.&lt;ref name=expertlaw1/&gt;

Negative aspects of using a living trust as opposed to a will and probate include upfront legal expenses, the expense of trust administration, and a lack of certain safeguards. The cost of the trust may be 1% of the estate per year versus the one-time probate cost of 1 to 4% for probate, which applies whether or not there is a [[Intestate|drafted will]]. Unlike trusts, wills must be signed by two to three witnesses, the number depending on the law of the jurisdiction in which the will is executed. Legal protections that apply to probate but do not automatically apply to trusts include provisions that protect the decedent's assets from mismanagement or embezzlement, such as requirements of [[surety bond|bonding]], [[insurance]], and itemized accountings of probate assets.

==== Estate tax effect ====
Living trusts generally do not shelter assets from the [[Estate tax (United States)|U.S. federal estate tax]]. Married couples may, however, effectively double the estate tax exemption amount by setting up the trust with a formula clause.&lt;ref&gt;The formula clause may be: "I leave to my child the maximum allowable amount that is not subject to federal estate tax, with the remainder going to my wife." As of 2013, transfers to spouses are exempt from estate tax. See: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahljacobs/2013/01/02/after-the-fiscal-cliff-deal-estate-and-gift-tax-explained/ After The Fiscal Cliff Deal: Estate And Gift Tax Explained]. ''Forbes''.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a living trust, the grantor may retain some level of control to the trust, such by appointment as [[protector (trust)|protector]] under the [[trust instrument]]. Living trusts also, in practical terms, tend to be driven to large extent by [[tax]] considerations. If a living trust fails, the property will usually be held for the grantor/settlor on [[resulting trust]]s, which in some notable cases, has had catastrophic tax consequences.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===South Africa===
In many ways trusts in South Africa operate similarly to other [[common law]] countries, although the [[law of South Africa]] is actually a hybrid of the British common law system and [[Roman-Dutch law]].

In [[South Africa]], in addition to the traditional living trusts and will trusts there is a ‘bewind trust’ (inherited from the Roman-Dutch ''bewind'' administered by a ''bewindhebber'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moorestephens.co.za/images/uploads/trust-overview-gmp-msw.pdf Trust Overview]. Moore Stephens Chartered Accountants.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the beneficiaries own the trust assets while the trustee administers the trust, although this is regarded by modern Dutch law as not actually a trust.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley JA. (1996). ''Trends in Contemporary Trust Law'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=VvM-CsSb1EYC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 108].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bewind'' trusts are created as trading vehicles providing trustees with limited liability and certain tax advantages.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In South Africa, minor children cannot inherit assets and in the absence of a trust and assets held in a state institution, the Guardian's Fund, and released to the children in adulthood. Therefore, testamentary (will) trusts often leave assets in a trust for the benefit of these minor children.

There are two types of living trusts in South Africa, namely vested trusts and discretionary trusts. In vested trusts, the benefits of the beneficiaries are set out in the trust deed, whereas in discretionary trusts the trustees have full discretion at all times as to how much and when each beneficiary is to benefit.

====Asset protection====
Until recently, there were tax advantages to living trusts in South Africa, although most of these advantages have been removed. Protection of assets from creditors is a modern advantage. With notable exceptions, assets held by the trust are not owned by the trustees or the beneficiaries, the creditors of trustees or beneficiaries can have no claim against the trust. Under the Insolvency Act (Act 24 of 1936), assets transferred into a living trust remain at risk from external creditors for 6 months if the previous owner of the assets is solvent at the time of transfer, or 24 months if he/she is insolvent at the time of transfer. After 24 months, creditors have no claim against assets in the trust, although they can attempt to attach the loan account, thereby forcing the trust to sell its assets. Assets can be transferred into the living trust by selling it to the trust (through a loan granted to the trust) or donating cash to it (any natural person can donate R100 000 per year without attracting donations tax; 20% donations tax applies to further donations within the same tax year).

====Tax considerations====
Under South African law living trusts are considered tax payers. Two types of tax apply to living trusts, namely income tax and capital gains tax (CGT). A trust pays income tax at a flat rate of 40% (individuals pay according to income scales, usually less than 20%). The trust's income can, however, be taxed in the hands of either the trust or the beneficiary. A trust pays CGT at the rate of 20% (individuals pay 10%). Trusts do not pay deceased estate tax (although trusts may be required to pay back outstanding loans to a deceased estate, in which the loan amounts are taxable with deceased estate tax).&lt;ref&gt;E-book: Trusts for Business Owners, by Peter Carruthers and Robert Velosa.&lt;/ref&gt;

The taxpayer whose residence has been ‘locked’ into a trust has now been given another opportunity to take advantage of these CGT exemptions. The Taxation Law Amendment Act of 30 September 2009 commenced on 1 January 2010 and granted a 2-year window period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011, affording a natural person the opportunity to take transfer of the residence with advantage of no transfer duty being payable or CGT consequences. Whilst taxpayers can take advantage of this opening of a window of opportunity, it is not likely that it will ever become available thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Winston E. | last = Miller | title = Dump That Trust Through The Window: Family Trust Tax Window | url = http://www.lawchambers.co.za/article_family_trust_tax_window.htm | date = 18 December 2009 | publisher = Winston Miller Attorneys}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Intellectual Property Day''' is observed annually on 26 April.&lt;ref name="WIPO"&gt; WIPO web site, [http://www.wipo.int/ip-outreach/en/ipday/ ''World Intellectual Property Day – 26 April'']. Consulted on 20 April 2011. &lt;/ref&gt; The event was established by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) in 2000 to "raise awareness of how [[patent]]s, [[copyright]], [[trademark]]s and [[Industrial design right|design]]s impact on daily life" and "to celebrate creativity, and the contribution made by creators and [[innovator]]s to the development of societies across the globe".&lt;ref name="WIPO"/&gt; 26 April was chosen as the date for World Intellectual Property Day because it coincides with the date on which the [[Convention Establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization]] entered into force in 1970. [[File:WIPO Celebrates Visionary Innovators.jpg|thumb|An exhibition showing the [[intellectual property]] (IP) behind [[Steve Jobs]]’ innovations opened to the public at [[WIPO]] on 30 March 2012 and ran through to ''World Intellectual Property Day'' on 26 April 2012.

== History ==
Following a statement made at the Assembly of the Member States of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in September 1998, the Director General of the National [[Algeria]]n Institute for Industrial Property (INAPI) proposed on 7 April 1999 the [[institutionalisation]] of an [[international observance|international day]] for intellectual property, with the aim of 
:"[setting up] a framework for broader mobilization and awareness, [opening up] access to the promotional aspect of innovation and [recognizing] the achievements of promoters of [[intellectual property]] throughout the world."&lt;ref&gt; Letter of 7 April 1999 from Amor Bouhnik, Director General of the National Algerian Institute for Industrial Property, to the Director General of WIPO (Ref: 027 DG/MS/99) in World Intellectual Property Organization web site, ''{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/documents/en/document/govbody/wo_gb_ga/ga24_7.htm |title=WIPO General Assembly, Twenty-Fourth (14th Ordinary) Session, Geneva, 20 to 29 September 1999, Institutionalization of an International Day for Intellectual Property. Proposal by the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria |accessdate=28 April 2007 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031222105430/http://www.wipo.int/documents/en/document/govbody/wo_gb_ga/ga24_7.htm |archivedate=22 December 2003 |df=dmy-all }}'', WO/GA/24/7, 10 August 1999. &lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 August 1999, the Chinese delegation to the WIPO proposed the adoption of the "World Intellectual Property Day"
:"in order to further promote the awareness of intellectual property protection, expand the influence of intellectual property protection across the world, urge countries to publicize and popularize intellectual property protection laws and regulations, enhance the public [[legal awareness]] of intellectual property rights, encourage invention-innovation activities in various countries and strengthen international exchange in the intellectual property field".&lt;ref&gt; Letter dated 9 August 1999 from Jiang Ying, Commissioner of the [[State Intellectual Property Office|State Intellectual Property Office of the People's Republic of China]], to Dr. [[Kamil Idris]], Director General of World Intellectual Property Organization, Geneva, Switzerland, in World Intellectual Property Organization web site, ''{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/documents/en/document/govbody/wo_gb_ga/ga24_8.htm |title=WIPO General Assembly, Twenty-Fourth (14th Ordinary) Session, Geneva, 20 to 29 September 1999, Institutionalization of a World Intellectual Property Day.

In October 1999, the General Assembly of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) approved the idea of declaring a particular day as a World Intellectual Property Day.&lt;ref&gt; World Intellectual Property Organization, [http://www.wipo.int/documents/en/document/govbody/wo_gb_ga/doc/ga26_2.doc ''WIPO General Assembly, Twenty-Sixth (12th Extraordinary) Session, Geneva, 25 September to 3 October 2000, Memorandum of the Director General''], WO/GA/26/2, 26 July 2000. &lt;/ref&gt;
