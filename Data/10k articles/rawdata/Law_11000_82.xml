      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1579">The '''36.9 ultimatum''' refers to the 1997 ultimatum by then-[[Prime Minister of Norway]], [[Thorbjørn Jagland]], that his government would resign if the [[Norwegian Labour Party]] gained less than 36.9% of the votes (the percentage gained by the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1993|Labour Party in 1993]] under [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]]) in the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1997|parliamentary election]], no matter what the parliamentary situation would be. 

As the Labour Party gained only 35%, Jagland's government resigned, even though the Labour party won the election in the sense that it remained the biggest party and could have continued in government. Jagland's 36.9 ultimatum was subject to much public ridicule in 1997 and subsequent years, as well as strong criticism within his own party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.proinno-europe.eu/extranet/upload/countryreports/Norway_CR_June2000.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-10-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720173437/http://www.proinno-europe.eu/extranet/upload/countryreports/Norway_CR_June2000.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Labour Party formed a government again in 2000, [[Jens Stoltenberg]] became Prime Minister with Jagland as Foreign Minister;  Jens Stoltenberg also succeeded Jagland as leader of the Labour Party in 2002.

'''Alexander Mordecai Bickel''' (December 17, 1924 – November 8, 1974) was an [[United States|American]] law professor and expert on the [[United States Constitution]]. One of the most influential constitutional commentators of the twentieth century, his writings emphasize [[judicial restraint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shapiro |first=Fred R. |year=2000 |title=The Most-Cited Legal Scholars |journal=Journal of Legal Studies |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=409–426 |doi=10.1086/468080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Bickel was born in [[Bucharest]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], to Jewish parents, Solomon and Yetta Bickel. The family emigrated to [[New York City]] in 1939. He graduated ''[[Phi Beta Kappa]]'' from [[City College of New York]] in 1947 and ''[[summa cum laude]]'' from  [[Harvard Law School]] in 1949.&lt;ref name="FreeDict"&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Bickel,+Alexander+Mordecai Bickel, Alexander Mordecai] in the Legal Dictionary of the Free Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

Following law school, Bickel was a [[law clerk]] for federal judge [[Calvert Magruder]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]]. In 1950, he went to Europe as a law officer of the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], serving in [[Frankfurt, Germany]], and with the [[European Defense Community]] Observer Delegation in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="FreeDict"/&gt;

In 1952, he returned to the U.S., and clerked for [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court Justice]] [[Felix Frankfurter]] in the Court's 1952–53 term. He prepared a historic memorandum for Frankfurter,  urging that ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' be reargued.&lt;ref name="FreeDict"/&gt;

In 1956, he became an instructor at [[Yale Law School]], where he taught until his death. He was named Chancellor Kent Professor of Law and Legal History in 1966, and Sterling Professor of Law in 1974.&lt;ref name="FreeDict"/&gt;

With colleague [[Charles Black (professor)|Charles Black]], Bickel established Yale Law as a respected center for the study of constitutional law.

A frequent contributor to ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'', Bickel argued against "[[prior restraint]]" of the press by the government as part of the successful representation of ''The New York Times'' in the [[Pentagon Papers]] case (1971).  He also defended President [[Richard Nixon]]’s order to dismiss special [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] prosecutor [[Archibald Cox]].

Bickel died of [[cancer]] at his home in [[Connecticut]], at 49 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Van Gelder |first=Lawrence |date=November 8, 1974 |title=Alexander M. Bickel Dies: Constitutional Law Expert |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/08/archives/alexander-m-bickel-dies-constitutional-law-expert-a-legal.html |work=The New York Times |location=New York |access-date=October 18, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
Bickel's most distinctive contribution to constitutional law was to stress what he called "the passive virtues" of judicial decision-making – the refusal to decide cases on substantive grounds if narrower grounds exist to decide the case. Bickel viewed "private ordering" and [[Alternative dispute resolution|the voluntary working-out of problems]] as generally preferable to legalistic solutions.

In his books ''The Supreme Court and the Idea of Progress'' and ''The Morality of Consent'', Bickel attacked the [[Earl Warren|Warren Court]] for what he saw as its misuse of history, shoddy reasoning, and sometimes arbitrary results. Bickel thought that the Warren Court's two most important lines of decision, ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' and ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'', did not produce the results the Court had intended.  In his book ''The Least Dangerous Branch'', Bickel coined the term ''[[countermajoritarian difficulty]]'' to describe his view that judicial review stands in tension with democratic theory.

Bickel envisioned the Supreme Court as playing a statesman-like role in national controversies, engaging in dialogue with the other branches of government. Thus he did not see the Court as a purely passive body, but as one which should lead public opinion, albeit carefully.

Bickel's writings addressed such varied topics as [[constitutionalism]] and [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] thought, [[citizenship]], [[civil disobedience]], [[freedom of speech]], [[moral authority]] and intellectual thought. Bickel has been cited by Chief Justice [[John Roberts]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c-span.org/special/roberts.asp&lt;/ref&gt; and by Justice [[Samuel Alito]]&lt;ref name=WS01/&gt; as a major influence and is widely considered one of the most influential constitutional [[Conservatism|conservative]]s of the 20th century.

Relative to Alito's legal thinking and philosophy, one writer in 2011 looked particularly at Alito dissents in ''[[Snyder v. Phelps]]'', ''[[Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association]]'', and ''[[United States v. Stevens]]'', three [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] cases. The writer traced the influence of ''The Supreme Court and the Idea of Progress'', ''The Morality of Consent'' and other Bickel writings both as they bore on Alito's developing thinking in college and as he chose to go to Yale (Bickel would die during Alito's third year there); and as the Bickel writings bore on the solitary or minority opinions Alito wrote in the three cases, here departing in cases even from other usually allied conservative members of the Court.&lt;ref name=WS01&gt;White, Adam J., [http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/burkean-justice_576470.html?page=3 "The Burkean Justice: Samuel Alito’s understanding of community and tradition distinguishes him from his Supreme Court colleagues"], ''The Weekly Standard'', Jul 18, 2011 (16: 41). Retrieved 2011-08-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bickel was a gifted and easily accessible instructor. In 1971, he was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=June 25, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725002054/http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf| archivedate= 25 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He inaugurated the DeVane Lecture series at Yale in 1972 where he taught a large class mostly of Yale undergraduates.

'''Ali Charaf Damache''' is a citizen of [[Algeria]] and [[Ireland]] who was the first suspected terrorist to be [[extradite]]d to the USA during the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Donald Trump presidency]].&lt;ref name=Independent2015-12-11/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cbs2017-07-21/&gt;  He is alleged to have been the ringleader of a cell tasked with killing [[Lars Vilks]], a Swedish artist, some Muslims accused of blasphemy for having drawn the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] in a cartoon.&lt;ref name=Reuters2012-12-08/&gt;

Although he was born in Algeria, he grew up in [[France]].&lt;ref name=SelfRad/&gt;

In 2009, Damache married [[Jamie Paulin Ramirez]], an American convert to Islam he met online, through a dating site for American Muslims.&lt;ref name=Reuters2012-12-08/&gt;  Ramirez would go by the nickname ''"Jihad Jamie"'', and would eventually receive an 8-year sentence for playing a role in the plot to kill Vilks.&lt;ref name=Reuters2014-01-08/&gt;

Ramirez and [[Colleen LaRose]], another American convert to Islam, traveled to Ireland to participate in the murder plot.&lt;ref name=Cbs2017-07-21/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters2012-12-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters2014-01-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=SelfRad/&gt;  Ramirez and Damache wed the day she arrived in Ireland.  Both Ramirez and Damache were blonde, with blue eyes.  Commentators would assert that Damache and his colleagues sought out blonde-haired, blue-eyed converts because, once radicalized, they would find it easy to cross borders without suspicion.

Law enforcement officials in [[Ireland]] arrested Damache and six other individuals, in Ireland, in 2010, after learning of the plot against Vilks.&lt;ref name=SelfRad/&gt;&lt;ref name=Experiences/&gt;  LaRose, who went by the nickname ''"Jihad Jane"'', is reported to have tipped off authorities herself, after she grew disenchanted with Damache.  While he had impressed her, online, she was disappointed after meeting him in person, and seeing he had trouble paying his bills.

LaRose returned to the USA, where she pled guilty and received a ten-year sentence.&lt;ref name=SelfRad/&gt;&lt;ref name=Experiences/&gt;  Damache was only charged with sending a threatening text message.  Ireland considered, and rejected, an extradition request from the USA.&lt;ref name=TheLocalSpain2017-07-22/&gt;

Spain arrested Damache, in December 2015, at the request of the USA.&lt;ref name=Independent2015-12-11/&gt;  The USA had charged Damache with trying to recruit others to terrorism, and leading the cell that included LaRose.&lt;ref name=TheLocalSpain2017-07-22/&gt;  The USA announced they had received Damache on July 21, 2017.&lt;ref name=Cbs2017-07-21/&gt;

They cited a video she recorded of the boy in Ireland wearing a robe and a scarf, and carrying toy gun. On the video, prosecutors said, she commands her son to "attack the kuffar," or non-believers, and he fires the toy gun.

== Occurrence ==
Allendeite was found as nano-crystals in an ultra[[refractory]] inclusion in the [[Allende meteorite]].&lt;ref name="original" /&gt; The Allende meteorite has shown to be full of new minerals, after nearly forty years it has produced one in ten of the now known minerals in meteorites.&lt;ref name="original" /&gt; This CV3 [[carbonaceous chondrite]] was the largest ever recovered on earth and is referred to as the best-studied meteorite in history.&lt;ref name="original" /&gt; The inclusion has only been viewed via [[electron microscopy]].&lt;ref name="original" /&gt; The sample is one centimeter in diameter and has been entrusted to the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of Natural History]] with the catalog number USNM7554.&lt;ref name="original" /&gt; One crystal studied is a single 15 x 25 [[micron]] size with included [[perovskite]], various [[osmium]]-[[iridium]]-[[molybdenum]]-[[tungsten]] [[alloy]]s, and scandium-stabilized [[tazheranite]].&lt;ref name="original" /&gt; In fact, all allendeite was in contact with perovskite.&lt;ref name="original"/&gt; The grains are [[Anhedral (petrology)|anhedral]], with no observable crystal forms or [[Crystal twinning|twinning]].&lt;ref name="original" /&gt;

==Significance==
Various [[scandium]] rich minerals have been found in meteorites, including; [[davisite]], [[panguite]], [[kangite]], [[tazheranite]], [[thortveitite]], and [[eringaite]].&lt;ref name="original"/&gt; Of these, allendeite is the most Sc rich, with only [[pretulite]] containing substantially more scandium.&lt;ref name="original"/&gt;

==Appearance==
[[Color]], [[Streak (mineralogy)|streak]], [[Luster (mineralogy)|luster]], [[Mohs hardness|hardness]], [[Tenacity (mineralogy)|tenacity]], [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]], [[Fracture (mineralogy)|fracture]], [[density]], and [[refractive index]] could not be observed because the grain size was too small and the section bearing the mineral was [[Optical mineralogy|optically]] thick.&lt;ref name="original" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="62827">The '''[[Asia-Pacific Telecommunity|Asia-Pacific Telecommunity (APT)]] [[Bandplan|band plan]]''' is a type of segmentation of the 698–806&amp;nbsp;MHz band (usually referred to as the '''700&amp;nbsp;MHz''' band) formalized by the APT in 2008–2010&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aptsec.org/sites/default/files/APT-AWF-REP-14_APT_Report_Harmonized_Freq_Arrangement.doc&lt;/ref&gt; and specially configured for the deployment of [[mobile broadband]] technologies (e.g. most notably [[LTE (telecommunication)|Long Term Evolution, LTE]]&lt;nowiki /&gt;). This segmentation exists in two variants, [[Frequency division duplexing|FDD]] and [[Time-division duplex|TDD]], that have been standardized by the [[3GPP|3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/36101.htm |title=3GPP specification: 36.101 |publisher=3gpp.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recommended by the [[ITU|International Telecommunications Union (ITU)]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;http://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/m/R-REC-M.1036-4-201203-I!!PDF-E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; as segmentations A5 and A6,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=brweb |url=http://www.itu.int/rec/recommendation.asp?lang=en&amp;parent=R-REC-M.1036-4-201203-I |title=M.1036 : Frequency arrangements for implementation of the terrestrial component of International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) in the bands identified for IMT in the Radio Regulations (RR) |publisher=Itu.int |date=2012-06-12 |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. The APT band plan has been designed to enable the most efficient use of available [[Radio spectrum|spectrum]]. Therefore, this plan divides the band into contiguous blocks of frequencies that are as large as possible taking account of the need to avoid interference with services in other frequency bands. As the result, the TDD option (segmentation A6) includes 100&amp;nbsp;MHz of continuous spectrum, while the FDD option (segmentation A5) comprises two large blocks, one of 45&amp;nbsp;MHz for uplink transmission (mobile to network) in the lower part of the band and the other also of 45&amp;nbsp;MHz for downlink transmission in the upper part. As defined in the standard, both FDD and TDD schemes for the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band include [[guard band]]s of 5&amp;nbsp;MHz and 3&amp;nbsp;MHz at their lower and upper edges, respectively. The FDD version also includes a center gap of 10&amp;nbsp;MHz. The guardbands serve the purpose of mitigating interference with adjacent bands while the FDD center gap is required to avoid interference between uplink and downlink transmissions. The two arrangements are shown graphically in figures 1 and 2.

The rest of the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band is set to be attributed to International Mobile Telecommunications [[IMT Advanced|International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT)]]. With this, FCC demonstrates its leadership and vision in spectrum management as early as a decade before the APT band plan is created and long before the appearance of mobile data growth phenomenon. However, as a result, the US band plan is shaped in a highly complex and fragmented way.|| 1997 – The international public telecommunications numbering plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=tsbmail |url=http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/en |title=E.164 : The international public telecommunication numbering plan |publisher=Itu.int |date=2013-03-06 |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; is published in Recommendation E.164 by the ITU

== Advantages ==

=== General ===

The APT band plan has been developed over a 2.5 year period and was based on considerable technical studies by industry and governments. For the overall success of the creation of the harmonized band plan, high degree of cooperation among industry stakeholders (governments, vendors, operators, associations, and other) was key. As a result, the APT band plan is very well-thought from the technical point of view and is able to meet modern and future requirements by networks, user equipment and growing demand of connectivity.

=== Economic ===

==== Potential for economies of scale ====
Because many countries across the globe have adopted the APT band plan, substantial economies of scale are bound to be created. That will lead to personal devices' and network elements' price erosion and thus, also to increasingly higher penetration of mobile devices and mobile internet.

==== Room for more competition ====

The APT band plan allows that up to 4 operators could receive wide spectrum blocks (2x 10&amp;nbsp;MHz in this case), or 3 operators getting 2x 15&amp;nbsp;MHz each, or other mixed configurations. On the other hand, in the US, there are only two commercial operators using the band (AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless), each of them having 2x 10&amp;nbsp;MHz of spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/document/promoting-interoperability-700-mhz-commercial-spectrum |title=Promoting Interoperability in the 700 MHz Commercial Spectrum |publisher=FCC.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Potentially, the most harmonized band in the world ====

The APT band plan has already become a multi-regionally harmonized spectrum band that will provide a coherent ecosystem for LTE devices. Most Asian countries have already opted for the APT band; there is a strong evidence of a rising regional consensus among the vast majority of Latin American countries. Europe’s "second" digital dividend matches the second [[duplexer]] of the APT band plan which implies that the user equipment, as well as network elements will be compatible with those of the APT band plan. Additionally, some Middle East and African countries have already shown their preference of the APT band plan.

==== Spectrum planning flexibility ====

The APT band plan allows greater national spectrum planning flexibility for governments all over the world, giving the possibility to adjust channel sizes to necessities of particular market and country by allocating blocks ranging from 2x 5&amp;nbsp;MHz up to 2x 20&amp;nbsp;MHz.

=== Technical ===

==== Full interoperability ====

With the inclusion of two-duplexer system in the devices and network equipment, full interoperability is guaranteed across the entire band of the APT band plan. In a nutshell, it means that any user will be able to use his/her mobile device in any network in the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band where the APT band plan is used, regardless of the mobile operator and the country. On the contrary, in the US band plan, there are two or three different device ecosystems which translate to non-interoperability within the country, and severe limitations (most probably, practically unavailability) of international [[roaming]].&lt;ref&gt;https://competitivecarriers.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/RCA-700MHz-Interoperability-FNL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wide channel size ====

The APT band plan represents two blocks of 45&amp;nbsp;MHz of contiguous spectrum. This enables operators to enjoy much wider channels comparing to the blocks available within the US band plan. That translates to much greater efficiency of networks, higher data throughput levels, lower latency and lesser investments needed for network deployment, all other factors being equal. Wider channel sizes are crucially important for the networks of the nearest future because of the growth of mobile data and projected capacity demand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/_assets/main/lib311973/ericsson_ifc34-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Strong protective measures against interference ====

The APT band plan assures appropriate protective measures for other services in adjacent bands which allow avoiding harmful interference from TV services in lower bands as well as from cellular networks in upper bands. In the same manner, the center gap of 10&amp;nbsp;MHz protects the band from self-interference.

==== Adaptiveness to future technological demands ====

In the near future, the phenomenon of asymmetric traffic (when downlink experiences more traffic than uplink) can be mitigated by applying signal processing techniques that are currently under consideration in the standards development process for the APT band plan. Examples of such techniques are: skewing the number of [[MIMO]] antennas to the side where higher traffic is needed, [[Multi-user MIMO]], and other methods.

== Challenges ==

=== “Competition” with the US band plan ===

US band plan was developed significantly earlier than the APT band plan. As of today, there are successful deployments of LTE networks in the USA. Due to this fact, the ecosystem of this band plan is relatively well-developed with two large networks already operating commercially and with a number of user devices existing on the market. The APT band plan does not yet enjoy a ready ecosystem and, therefore, has to “compete” with the US band plan in order to become the preferred way for countries to segment the band.

=== The ecosystem of devices and network elements is yet to be developed ===

Another existing challenge is the advancement of its own ecosystem, which in turn depends on equipment vendors: terminal devices manufacturers ([[HTC]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Samsung]], [[Nokia]], etc.), producers of parts of terminals (such as [[Qualcomm]]) and vendors that manufacture network elements ([[Ericsson]], [[Nokia Siemens Networks]], [[Alcatel-Lucent]], [[Huawei]], etc.). The development of the ecosystem depends heavily on the demand that exists on the market and is a function of the created economies of scale.

=== China’s intention to use the TDD configuration of the APT band plan ===

Most likely, China will follow the TDD configuration of the APT band plan, thus most probably becoming one of a handful of markets in the world that support such configuration, but still an important and large one. Even Taiwan, one of China’s closest neighbors, adopted the FDD version of the APT band plan. Furthermore, TDD configuration is technologically in many ways inferior to the FDD one. (It should be said, however, that in a number cases the TDD configuration proves to have certain advantages, such as larger capacity to bear with downlink disproportionately exceeding the uplink data transmission). In the same time, the TDD configuration of the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz, as it is seen today, is not expected to form part of the same ecosystem as the FDD mode either of the APT band plan, or of the US band plan. Therefore, it will not add up to economies of scale of neither of the two and a completely separate ecosystem might likely be developed.

=== Two duplexers issue ===

In the APT 700 FDD configuration, two overlapping duplexers are required to cover the entire band due to the limitations by current [[Filter (signal processing)|filter technologies]]. The existence of two duplexers in the APT band plan and the fact that European, Japanese (and perhaps some other future networks) will only work with one duplexer set, raise a question of whether user and network equipment manufacturers will incorporate both duplexers in their equipment or will create two parallel configurations – one with only one duplexer and another one with both of them. Presence of both configurations would lead to less significant economies of scale for each type of the equipment and to distortions in the economic valuation of different parts of the spectrum in the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band. Although the dynamics of the market such as the ever-increasing complexity of [[chipset]]s, [[Multi-band device|multi-band]] support by chip manufacturers demonstrate that the most likely outcome is the inclusion of both duplexers in all devices.
Additionally, whereas channel [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidths]] up to 15&amp;nbsp;MHz can be supported anywhere within the band, channel bandwidths of 20&amp;nbsp;MHz are limited to the upper and lower parts of the band and may not be employed in the mid-portion of the band where the filters overlap.

As of 2014, most equipment vendors have released two versions of their radio units: one dedicated to the lower band and another one dedicated to the upper band. A notable alternative is provided by [[Alcatel-Lucent]] - their RRH2x40-07APT-4R radio unit covers the entire band 28 (45&amp;nbsp;MHz) within a single radio unit thus negating the need of sourcing two different radio unit variants.

== Ecosystem ==

=== Incompatibility with the US band plan ===

Frequency arrangements of the US band plan and the APT band plan substantially overlap thus making them largely incompatible. The 3GPP has designated five operating bands for the US band plan (Bands 12, 13, 14, 17, 29) and two bands for the APT band plan (Band 28 for FDD version and Band 44 for TDD version). There are distinct differences among the operating bands such as different channel bandwidths and channel locations within the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band. More specifically, duplex spacing and guardband peculiarities of the APT band plan is what differentiates it most. US band plan, in its turn, is characterized by a number of inconsistencies: i) non-existence of in-band interoperability (i.e. devices working in band 13 are not compatible with devices working with in either of the bands 12, 14, 17); ii) harmful interference from TV channels; iii) absence of user equipment in Band 12 (it is also not likely to appear in the future)[EDIT 12/1/2014: Band 12 equipment is already available]; iv) no current use of the D and E blocks in the lower part of the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band (there is a 12&amp;nbsp;MHz TDD frequency block); and some other issues. As a result of these peculiarities of segmentation, block A of the lower 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band is practically not used due to interference from TV Channel 51.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Information/WORK_PLAN/Description_Releases/ |title=Index of /ftp/Information/WORK_PLAN/Description_Releases |publisher=3gpp.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the total of 23x2 MHz of spectrum owned and used by AT&amp;T and Verizon,&lt;ref&gt;http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-10-278A1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 3x2 MHz cannot be used due to limitations by LTE technology standards - only blocks of 5, 10, 15, 20&amp;nbsp;MHz can be used according to 3GPP industry standards.

[[File:Incompatibility of the US band plan and the APT band plan in the 700 MHz band.png|thumb|Figure 3. Incompatibility of the US band plan and the APT band plan in the 700 MHz band]]

=== Compatibility of the APT band plan with the foreseen usage of the 700 MHz band in different regions of the world ===

European countries, which still continue have a high occupancy of [[broadcasting]] services in the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band that have been granted a period until 2015 to convert to [[Digital television transition|digital]]. It appears that since the APT segmentation is based on two overlapping duplexers of 30+30&amp;nbsp;MHz, it fits perfectly in the European scheme, as shown on the graph below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.analysysmason.com/About-Us/News/Insight/Implementing-the-second-digital-dividend--harmonisation-is-key/#.UWMw35aebd9 |title=Analysys Mason |publisher=Analysys Mason |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This compatibility opens the way for the harmonization of the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band with the European region. Japan, one of largest and most advanced Asian markets and the global technology leader is using the upper duplexer part of the APT band plan and thus will enjoy being the part of the ecosystem of the APT band plan too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telecomasia.net/content/japan-allocates-700-mhz-spectrum |title=Japan allocates 700-MHz spectrum |publisher=Telecom Asia |date= |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This basically means that the terminals designed to work in the APT band plan will perfectly function in Europe and Japan, thus adding up to the size of the market that is being created by the APT band plan.
All facts mentioned above and the recent announcements from various governments indicate that the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band in the FDD mode of the APT band plan is becoming one of the most harmonized band that exists in the world. This extent of harmonization will lead to economies of scale which will in turn drag down the prices of terminals, speed up adoption of smart devices and finally convert to socio-economic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/the-benefits-of-digital-dividend-in-the-americas-1706611.htm |title=The Benefits of Digital Dividend in the Americas |publisher=Marketwire.com |date=2012-09-27 |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Comparison of 700, 800 and 900 MHz bands across regions.png|thumb|Figure 4. Scheme of possible harmonization of sub 1 GHz bands]]

=== User equipment ===

At the given moment, the user equipment (UE) for this segmentation scheme has not yet been released commercially. In the same time, the development of 3GPP and ITU standards (bands 28 and 44) and evident signals that has been sent to the market by many countries in Asia, Latin America and elsewhere, indicate that technological developments of the required ecosystem (first of all, in terms of user equipment and network equipment) are currently underway. Some of the strongest signals for the future demand have been sent by large markets, such as Japan, India, Indonesia, and above all, Mexico. This country was the first large market in Americas to adopt the APT band plan despite historical path dependency and despite having a 3,000&amp;nbsp;km border with the USA which uses a different segmentation of the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band. Another point that is worth to mention is that the standardization work that has been carried out by the 3GPP was strongly supported by many key companies from the industry. That also proves that the equipment manufacturers are in the process of the commercialization of UE and network elements driven by the creation of significant market by the APT band plan.
All that seems to indicate that first prototypes of APT devices will appear in the Q2 of 2013 and market releases are to be expected in the second half of 2013. In Latin America, for example, the National Spectrum Agency (ANE) of Colombia has announced that Huawei, ZTE and Ericsson will conduct tests in the band under the standard APT pipeline in the first quarter of 2013, using equipment developed by the leading manufacturers with the goal to auction off the spectrum in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcrwireless.com/americas/20121017/spectrum/colombia-moves-toward-lte-700-mhz-huawei-zte-ericsson-conduct-tests/ |title=Colombia moves toward LTE in 700 MHz; Huawei, ZTE and Ericsson to conduct testsRCR Wireless News Americas |publisher=Rcrwireless.com |date=2012-10-17 |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to economies of scale that are being created by the APT band plan, the price of smart devices could then lower down significantly.

=== Current state and recent developments ===

A significant number of countries have already adopted the APT segmentation scheme: Australia, India, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan, and Tonga in Asia; and Brazil, Costa-Rica, Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Ecuador, Panama and Argentina in Latin America. In countries such as Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Uruguay, Paraguay, Peru and a few others it is scheduled to be adopted in the nearest future.
In Europe, allocation of the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band to mobile services implies challenges, acknowledged by the ITU-R in its decision that new allocations should not come into force until 2015 due to many countries in Europe having [[Digital terrestrial television|digital terrestrial television (DTT)]] services in 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band. That decision also takes into account the need for European countries to better study issues regarding the channel plan and to carry out compatibility studies regarding other services in the Region and on other topics, before taking final position on the best suitable allocation and associated regulation. However, once these issues are resolved, the APT band plan will become compatible with the usage of the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band in Europe, whereas the US band plan will not.

=== Spectrum harmonization and potential economies of scale ===

Generally speaking, it is very important that the spectrum is used in the same way across as many markets as possible to create economies of scale. That, in turn, leads to lower prices for the equipment thus increasing the adoption of the technology and having a direct and indirect impact on the economic growth. This growth consists of enhancement of productivity, job creation, entrepreneurship, infrastructure investment, taxation; all leading to GDP growth. According to the joint study of the [[GSM Association|GSMA]] and the [[Boston Consulting Group]], the biggest socio-economic benefits are likely to arise by allocating the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band to mobile services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsma.com/newsroom/asiapacific-could-generate-us1-trillion-in-gdp-through-spectrum-harmonisation/ |title=GSMA Announces Asia Pacific Could Generate US$1 Trillion in GDP Though Spectrum Harmonisation for Mobile Broadband &amp;#124; Newsroom |publisher=Gsma.com |date=2012-07-09 |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, by 2020, the allocation of 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band in Asia to mobile could generate a GDP increase of more than US$1 trillion (NPV of $960 billion) and tax revenue growth of US$215 billion, along with the creation of an additional 1.4 million new businesses (including new departments or business units within existing firms) and 2.7 million new jobs. Comparing allocation to mobile services and broadcasting services, which is another possible option of utilization of the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band, the first option would lead to significant incremental economic benefits over the broadcasting services – in particular, an extra US$959 billion in GDP, by 2020, as well as additional tax revenues of US$171 billion, 1.4 million more business activities, and 2.6 million additional jobs, according to the study.

Creation of economies of scale is vital for mass production of equipment and its further adoption in target markets. Overall, the greater economies of scale are, the lesser end user prices will be established and the vaster will be the adoption of the technology that translates to socio-economic benefits. Speaking about the ecosystem availability timeframes, many stakeholders expect the APT band plan ecosystem to develop rapidly as countries identify and auction spectrum with this frequency arrangement.

Although there exists a rather small spectral overlap that theoretically provides some opportunities for manufacturing equipment that would be operable across both plans, there are important technical considerations that are certain to constrain practical radio-frequency (RF) designs to separate markets for two band plans of the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band.

With the ongoing adoption of the LTE technology, future numerous deployments in the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band and the advancements in the microelectronics, the user devices of the future might support multiple LTE bands and potentially could even include RF designs (antennas, band chips, duplexers, filters, [[Oscillation|oscillators]] and other [[Electronic circuit|circuitry]]) supporting both the US band plan and the APT band plan. However, at least in the short- and medium-term, there will be separate markets for UE in these two existing band plan configurations.

As is it forecasted as of today, the US band plan will solely be used in the USA, Canada, Nicaragua and a handful of Caribbean islands. That, by itself, represents a significant market of an order of 410 million people.

However, the recent developments around the propagation of the APT band plan across Asia-Pacific region, Latin America, and thanks to the compatibility of the European frequency arrangements, as well as the situation in Africa and Middle East, project confidence that a far bigger market is being created worldwide. Summed up, the prospective overall market for the APT band plan translates to a figure of at the very least 3 billion people across the globe. With ongoing studies of the digital dividend in the world, that number is might increase and include nearly all the rest of the world.
First and foremost, vast number of Asian-Pacific countries have already adopted the APT band plan. For the moment, combined markets of Australia, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore and South Korea add up to around 2 billion 100 million people.
In the Middle East and Africa region, Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and United Arab Emirates are likely to follow Europe in using partially the frequency arrangement of the APT band plan which makes them fall into the same category of ecosystems. The number of such countries of the region is bound to rise. These countries alone represent a market equal to the one of the US band plan – around 330 million people.
In Latin America, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Costa-Rica, Panama, Peru, Venezuela have all officially adopted the APT band plan. The logical outcome of the ongoing regional harmonization process in Americas will be the resulting market of an order of 400 million consumers.
Given the size of the potential market that is on the verge of being created, the socio-economic benefits caused by booming access and adoption of the mobile internet by all social layers of population and driven by rocketing penetration of smart devices will be overwhelming and transformational.

== Technical characteristics and considerations ==

=== Existing standards for the APT band plan ===

The FDD mode of the APT band plan has been standardized by the 3GPP as the Band 28 (FDD 703-748 / 758 - 803&amp;nbsp;MHz) and the TDD mode - as the Band 44 (TDD 703 – 803&amp;nbsp;MHz). The work was completed at RAN4 #63 meeting in Czech Republic on May 21–25, 2012.

The segmentation scheme called "A5" for the band 698-806&amp;nbsp;MHz, corresponding to the FDD mode of the APT band plan, is defined by the Recommendation of ITU-R M.1036-4 (3/2012) "Frequency Arrangements for Implementation of the terrestrial component of International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) in the bands Identifies for IMT in the Radio Regulations (RR) "(ITU-R M.1036). The TDD version of the APT band plan is standardized as the “A6” segmentation scheme in accordance with the same Recommendation of ITU-R M.1036-4 (3/2012).
Current specifications can be found in 3GPP TS 36.101 v11.1.0 for the UE and 3GPP TS 36.104 v11.1.0 for the Base Stations. They correspond to the frequency arrangement of the Rec.

=== Technology ===

The most favored, popular mobile broadband technology internationally for the digital dividend
spectrum appears to be the FDD-LTE technology. LTE is known to offer operators and end users high [[Throughput|data throughput]] and low [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] which are the two main characteristics of a technology that is aimed to be used for data transmission. Peak speeds utilizing multiple antennas (MIMO) in optimal conditions are in excess of 300 Mbit/s. While actual speeds experienced by users will be dependent on equipment and the number of users connected to any cell, it is clear that LTE offers speeds which could result in a step-change in mobile broadband connectivity. The move to LTE is seen as the key next step for mobile network operators aiming to respond to the increasing demand for mobile data access. LTE offers greater spectral efficiency, allowing the provision of higher data speeds and greater data allowance, at lower cost. This will be particularly important for MNOs as average revenue per user from voice and text services falls. FDD-LTE offers a natural upgrade path from GSM and WCDMA technologies which are already widely implemented in New Zealand. It will be able to provide both mobile and fixed wireless broadband services. There is also growing interest from some manufacturers in using TDD-LTE in the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band. This move is led mainly by equipment manufacturers and mobile network operators in China. At the current moment in time, though, the technology is largely untested.

=== Comparison of FDD and TDD modes of the APT band plan ===

According to the estimates of Qualcomm, “in a coverage-limited system comparison using the same frequency band, the TDD system required 31% more base stations than FDD when using a 1:1 TDD system and 65% more base stations when using a 2:1 TDD system. Higher frequency bands required even more base stations.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qualcomm.com/media/documents/files/fdd-tdd-comparison.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that the major part of both capital and operational expenditures of operators have to do with base stations of the network, making their incurred costs directly proportional to the number of base stations, FDD deployments imply lower deployment and operating costs.

=== Duplexers ===

The duplexer is a filter that provides isolation of the transmitter leakage to its own receiver. In a mobile connected device, the transmitter and receiver are linked to the same antenna by means of a duplexer. Duplexer isolation of &gt; 45&amp;nbsp;dB is considered feasible by the industry. If the duplexer isolation is not sufficient then the handset may experience self-[[Desensitization (telecommunications)|desensitization]]. Multi-mode, multi-band handsets often have mode- and band-specific duplexers. Duplexer technology affects choice of duplex separation and centre band gap which have been designed for the APT band plan with these considerations in mind.

=== Duplex Spacing ===

[[File:Duplexer spacing in the APT band plan.png|thumb|Figure 5. Duplexers in the FDD mode of the APT band plan]]

Duplex spacing is the separation between the uplink channel and the corresponding downlink channel. A larger separation implies less likelihood of self-interference between a handset transmitter and its own receiver. Because a [[power amplifier]] out of band response is related to the bandwidth, the duplex separation requirement is also dependent on the carrier bandwidth in order to protect the receiver from self-interference. A duplex spacing of 30&amp;nbsp;MHz is sufficient to support carrier bandwidths of up to 10&amp;nbsp;MHz. This result is derived using 3GPP specification 3GPP 36.101.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

=== Center Gap ===

Centre gap is a key characteristic of FDD-based frequency arrangement represented by the gap between frequency blocks assigned for downlink and uplink respectively in the FDD-based arrangement as illustrated in Figure 5. It is common understanding that the duplex spacing and centre gap influence the duplexer performance so that larger separation brings the better isolation performance between downlink and uplink. Technically, this size of spacing affects the duplexer performance in the following two technical aspects:
* Self-desensitization for FDD Mobile Stations ([[Mobile station|MS]]) and FDD Base Stations ([[Base station|BS]])
* MS to MS interference and BS to BS interference

[[File:In-band interference mitigation in the APT band plan.png|thumb|Figure 6. Interference from other MS transmitter in adjacent channel]]

To prevent self-desensitization, a duplexer must attenuate Tx emissions at the own Rx frequency band below the Rx [[noise floor]]. This leads typically to at least a 45&amp;nbsp;dB attenuation requirement at the own Rx frequency band. Implementing this attenuation requirement is a simple matter with the suggested 2x50 MHz arrangement by the use of a dual duplexer because the own UL and DL bands are separated by much wider separation distance the 8&amp;nbsp;MHz that would have been the case if a single duplexer is applied. The center gap will also determine whether competitive networks can share base station sites with minimum interference and protective site filtering complexity.

[[File:Interference from other network in adjacent channel in the APT band plan.png|thumb|Figure 7. Interference from other network in adjacent channel]]

=== Guard bands ===

* a lower guard-band of 5&amp;nbsp;MHz is allocated between 698-703&amp;nbsp;MHz to ensure protection from the interference from TV channels that are situated in the lower bands in certain countries;
* an upper guard-band of 3&amp;nbsp;MHz is allocated between 803-806&amp;nbsp;MHz to ensure protection from the interference from existing upper cellular bands.

=== Dual Duplexer ===

The maximum bandwidth of an RF filter or duplexer for a terminal at this frequency range is today around 30-35&amp;nbsp;MHz. Any arrangement that efficiently uses the 108&amp;nbsp;MHz bandwidth in the frequency range 698-806&amp;nbsp;MHz must thus have more than one duplexer. “Dual duplexer” means that the handset has 2 duplexers, one per sub band as illustrated in figure 8.

[[File:Illustration of the use of dual duplexers in the APT band plan.jpg|thumb|Figure 8. Illustration of the use of dual duplexers]]

With the use of a dual duplexer arrangement the individual duplex spacing will be increased, providing at the same time more usable spectrum for FDD. With current technology it would not be possible to implement a [[passband]] of 50&amp;nbsp;MHz with a single duplex solution. The dual duplexer arrangement may lead to a 2x50 MHz FDD band plan. Dual duplexers are being specified today and would add to the number of band specific duplexers to be accommodated in handsets where physical space is at a premium.

As of 2014, most equipment vendors have released two versions of their radio units: one dedicated to the lower band and another one dedicated to the upper band. A notable alternative is provided by [[Alcatel-Lucent]] - their RRH2x40-07APT-4R radio unit covers the entire band 28 (45&amp;nbsp;MHz) within a single radio unit thus negating the need of sourcing two different radio unit variants.

=== Coexistence of different band plans ===

[[Radio waves]], due to its nature and physics, can cause harmful interference to networks and equipment operating in a different band plan, (i.e. in neighboring countries). That is why coherent policies and technical frameworks are routinely developed by countries to mitigate such interference. The 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band is no exception and is currently regulated by mutual agreements between countries.

As a common practice to approach such issues, there are two possible scenarios to consider:

*Both countries implement the same band plan. Adoption of similar band plans by neighboring countries will ensure alignment of uplink and downlink spectrum blocks and co channel or adjacent channel interference scenarios can be managed by existing 3GPP specifications and existing bilateral treaties between the countries.
*Both countries implement different band plans. The US and APT FDD band plans are incompatible in terms of the uplink and downlink patterns so there exists a need for coordination of spectrum along border areas. In some of such cases, the existing treaties and specification will still serve their purpose and can remain. Then, some additional engineering adjustments will be required for network deployments. The solution to this issue includes adjustments in transmitting antennas’ [[Beam tilt|tilt]], [[Antenna height considerations|height]], [[directivity]], [[Transmitter power output|output power]], or combination of those. With these protective measures, the harmful interference can be eradicated so that the radio electronic emissions at the border are kept within their mutually agreed norms.

'''''Attorney General of Botswana v. Unity Dow''''' (sometimes abbreviated '''''Attorney General v. Dow''''') was a High Court case in the Republic of [[Botswana]].  The [[plaintiff]], [[Unity Dow]], was a citizen of Botswana, married to a non-citizen, whose children had been denied [[citizenship]] under a provision of the [[Citizenship Act of 1984]].  This Act conferred citizenship on a child born in Botswana only if "a) his father was a citizen of Botswana; or b) in the case of a person born [[out of wedlock|out-of-wedlock]], his mother was a citizen of Botswana." The plaintiff claimed that this provision violated guarantees of the [[Constitution of Botswana]]. The High Court agreed, holding that the provision infringed:
*the [[right to liberty]];
*the right not to be [[deportation|expelled]] from Botswana;
*the right not to be subjected to degrading treatment; and
*the right not to be [[gender discrimination|discriminated against on the basis of sex]].

The Court concluded that the right to liberty had been infringed because the provision hampered a woman's free choice to marry a non-citizen and, in fact, undermined marriage.  The Court also decided that the right not to be expelled from Botswana was infringed because, if the plaintiff's resident permit was not renewed, she would be forced to leave Botswana if she desired to stay with her family.  Finally, the Court stated that the right not to be subjected to degrading treatment was infringed because any law discriminating against women constitutes an offense against human dignity.

This decision was subsequently upheld by the Botswana [[appellate court|Court of Appeal]].&lt;ref name="Unity Dow v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1220">The '''Betäubungsmittelgesetz''' ('''BtMG'''), generally meaning Narcotics Law, is the controlled-substances [[law of Germany]].  In common with the [[Misuse of Drugs Act of 1971]] of the United Kingdom and [[Controlled Substances Act]]s of the US and Canada, it is a consolidation of prior regulation and an implementation of treaty obligations under the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]], [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] and other treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Betäubungsmittelgesetz: deutsches und internationales Betäubungsmittelrecht |last=Körner |first=Harald Hans |year=1982 |publisher=Beck |isbn=978-3-406-07342-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The BtMG updated the German Opium Law 1929 and mirrors the Swiss BtMG and Austrian [[Suchtmittelgesetz]].

The wearing of [[bicycle helmet]]s, and attitudes towards their use vary around the world. Compulsory use of helmets has often been proposed and is the subject of much dispute (see [[Bicycle helmet laws]]), based largely on considerations of overall public health. Only two countries (Australia and New Zealand) currently require and enforce universal use of helmets by cyclists.  In some other jurisdictions, partial rules apply - for children, in certain states or sub-national areas, or under other limited conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helmets.org/mandator.htm#international Helmet Laws for Bicycle Riders], (pro-compulsion) Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''black triangle''' was a badge used in [[Nazi concentration camps]] to mark prisoners regarded "'''asocial'''" and "arbeitsscheu" ([[work-shy]]). Those considered asocial included thieves, murderers, [[nomad]]s, and [[Aryan#Nazism and white_supremacy|Aryans]] who engaged in sexual relations with Jews. Women deemed to be asocial included prostitutes, nonconformists, and [[lesbian|lesbians]].

==Usage==
[[Image:Kennzeichen für Schutzhäftlinge in den Konzentrationslagern.jpg|thumb|210px|The black triangle in the context of the marking system for prisoners in Nazi concentration camps.]]

===Nazi===
The symbol originates from [[Nazi Germany]], where every prisoner had to wear a concentration camp badge on their jacket, of which the design and color categorized them according to the reason for their internment. The [[homeless]] were included, as were alcoholics, those who habitually avoided work and employment, draft dodgers, pacifists, [[Romani people|Roma]] and  [[Sinti]] people, and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chgs.umn.edu/histories/documentary/hadamar/asocials.html The unsettled, "asocials", alcoholics and prostitutes]. Center for Holocaust &amp; Genocide Studies. [[University of Minnesota]]. Retrieved September 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Many black triangle prisoners were [[mentally disabled]] or [[mentally ill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Reddebrek|title=Remembering the Black Triangles|url=https://libcom.org/blog/remembering-black-triangles-16012018|website=libcom.org|date=January 16, 2018|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lesbians===
{{LGBT symbols}}

Nazis considered [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] women asocial and a threat to German society, and the badge was used to identify them.&lt;ref name="Elman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elman PhD|first1=R. Amy|title=Triangles and Tribulations: The Politics of Nazi Symbols|journal=[[Journal of Homosexuality]]|date=1996|volume=30|issue=3|pages=1–11|issn=0091-8369}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1970s, the black triangle was first used as a symbol of [[Gay pride|pride]] and [[wikt:solidarity|solidarity]] by lesbians in the United Kingdom; and its symbolic use was introduced in North America through the "women's [[peace camp]] movement".&lt;ref name="Zoe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zoe|first1=Lucinda|title=The Black Triangle|journal=[[Lesbian Herstory Archives|Lesbian Herstory Archives Newsletter]]|date=June 1991|issue=12|page=7|url=http://www.lesbianherstoryarchives.org/pdf/Newsletters/LHA%20Newsletter%2012%201991.pdf|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been adopted in remembrance of lesbians who suffered and died at the hands of Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Myers|first1=JoAnne|title=The A to Z of the Lesbian Liberation Movement: Still the Rage (The A to Z Guide Series, No. 73)|date=2003|publisher=[[The Scarecrow Press]]|location=Lanham, Maryland|edition=1st|page=69|isbn=978-0-8108-6811-3}} (2003 is original U.S. copyright.)&lt;/ref&gt; Some lesbians wear it for "historical precision".&lt;ref name="Elman" /&gt; 

===Disabled people===
Some UK groups concerned with the rights of disabled people have adopted the symbol in their campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blacktrianglecampaign.org/|title=Black Triangle Campaign|website=Black Triangle Campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpac.uk.net/|title=DPAC – Disabled People Against Cuts|website=www.dpac.uk.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such groups cite press coverage and government policies, including changes to [[disabled benefit|incapacity benefits]] and disability living allowance, as the reasons for their campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blacktrianglecampaign.org/2011/12/20/no-disability-living-allowance-for-me-nowhere-to-turn-for-many-more/|title=Black Triangle Campaign|date=20 December 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blacktrianglecampaign.org/2011/12/13/britains-press-are-fighting-a-class-war-defending-the-elite-they-belong-to/|title=Black Triangle Campaign|date=13 December 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Black Triangle List" was created to keep track of welfare-related deaths due to cuts by the [[Department for Work and Pensions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Laws|first1=Vince|title=UK Welfare-Related Deaths: The Black Triangle List|url=http://www.disabilityarts.online/uk-welfare-related-deaths-black-triangle-list-30-april-2015/|website=Disability Arts Online|date=April 30, 2015|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmacovigilance===
{{main|Black triangle (pharmacovigilance)}}
The inverted black triangle was first used in the UK to indicate that a [[Black triangle (pharmacovigilance)|drug or vaccine is new]] and to monitor its usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Black Triangle Scheme (▼ or ▼*)|url=https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/the-black-triangle-scheme-or|website=[[gov.uk]]|publisher=[[Government of the United Kingdom]]|date=11 December 2014|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was adopted by the [[European Union]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=News team|title=Black triangle system rolled out across Europe|url=https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/black-triangle-system-rolled-out-across-europe/11127323.article?firstPass=false|publisher=[[The Pharmaceutical Journal]]|date=1 October 2013|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medicines under additional monitoring|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/special_topics/document_listing/document_listing_000365.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac058067bfff|website=[[European Medicines Agency]]|date=2013|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Lund Black, Jr.''' (September 22, 1915 – May 5, 2001) was an American scholar of [[constitutional law]], which he taught as professor of law from 1947 to 1999.  He is best known for his role in the historic ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case, as well as for his ''Impeachment: A Handbook'', which served for many Americans as a trustworthy analysis of the law of impeachment during the [[Watergate scandal]].&lt;ref name="The New York Times Obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/08/nyregion/charles-l-black-jr-85-constitutional-law-expert-who-wrote-on-impeachment-dies.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=Charles L. Black Jr., 85, Constitutional Law Expert Who Wrote on Impeachment, Dies|date=10 May 2001|accessdate=19 December 2012|work=The New York Times|first=Robert D.|last=McFadden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Austin, Texas]], Black graduated from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1935 and later obtained a [[master's degree]] in English.  He received his [[LL.B.]] from [[Yale Law School]] in 1943, then served in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] as a teacher and as an associate at [[Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell|Davis, Polk, Wardwell, Sunderland &amp; Kiendl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.yale.edu/news/3330.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908012838/http://www.law.yale.edu/news/3330.htm |archivedate=2015-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, he became a professor of law at the [[Columbia University Law School]], where he wrote legal briefs for the successful 1954 ''Brown v. Board of Education'' suit.  He also was involved in civil rights cases in the south.

In 1956, he joined Yale Law School as its first [[Henry R. Luce]] Professor of Jurisprudence. He was appointed Sterling Professor of Law in 1975. During his thirty-one-year career at Yale, he wrote numerous books, including ''The People and the Court'', ''Structure and Relationship in Constitutional Law'', ''Impeachment: A Handbook.''

An outspoken critic of the death penalty, Professor Black also authored ''Capital Punishment: The Inevitability of Caprice and Mistake''. With [[Alexander Bickel]], Black made Yale Law School one of the world's leading centers for the study of constitutional law.

Black also co-authored ''The Law of Admiralty'' with [[Grant Gilmore]].  He often told students that when he and Gilmore were young professors, he decided that he needed to write a "black letter law" book as an alternative to relying solely on constitutional law to make his reputation.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} Although he was mainly known as a constitutional legal scholar, his work with Gilmore on Admiralty became canonical, and "The Law of Admiralty" is one of the most influential law books ever written in a practical area of law.  Admiralty is the law of the sea, of shipping and shipping contracts, and is a functional, practical area of international law, in which uniformity of the application of law in ports throughout the world is important, and as a result it has evolved somewhat differently from other areas of federal law.  "Gilmore and Black," as it was often called, became so influential that it is one of the few treatises that federal admiralty and international courts cite almost as though it were a primary source of law.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}  It is the most cited work of maritime law in history. {{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Black was an idiosyncratic and brilliant teacher who was fond of telling stories in a strong Texas drawl that sometimes puzzled students who were inattentive, eager to become hum-drum practitioners, or otherwise not cut out for high-level intellectual discourse.

Black was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to [[Columbia Law School]] in 1986, when his wife [[Barbara Aronstein Black]] became dean there. He served as adjunct professor of law until 1999. He died in [[New York City]] aged 85.

A lifelong fan of jazz, he was featured in the [[Ken Burns]] documentary [[Jazz (documentary)|Jazz: A History of American Music]], where he related hearing [[Louis Armstrong]] perform at an Austin hotel in 1931.  This experience, he said, fomented his interest in race and civil rights.

In 1959, Black published a poem, "Tracker home", in volume 3 of the [[avant garde]] [[small magazine]] [[Nomad (magazine)|''Nomad'']]. The short biography the back of the magazine describes him thus, &lt;blockquote&gt;Charles Black teaches in New Haven, Connecticut. His work has appeared in THE SOUTHWEST REVIEW, EPOCH, and THE CAROLINA QUARTERLY.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Black's obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'', former student [[Akhil Amar]] commented, "He was my hero. So many of the great moral issues of the 20th century seem clear in retrospect, but were quite controversial at the time. He had the moral courage to go against his race, his class, his social circle."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22032">[[Image:Angelstad-header4.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Angel Stadium of Anaheim]]. ''City of Anaheim v. Angels Baseball LP'' was a legal case over the terms of the team's lease of the city-owned stadium.]]
{{italic title}}
'''''City of Anaheim v. Angels Baseball LP''''' is a lawsuit filed in [[Orange County, California]] [[Superior Courts of California|Superior Court]] by the city of [[Anaheim, California]] against the owners of the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] [[Major League Baseball]] franchise, concerning the team's official name. The lawsuit and a related political and public relations battle sought to reverse the team's official name change from ''Anaheim Angels'' to ''Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim'', which the city characterized as a breach of the team's lease on the city-owned [[Angel Stadium of Anaheim]]. The city was unsuccessful, as both a trial jury and an appellate court ruled in the team's favor.

The Angels franchise was founded as the ''Los Angeles Angels'' in 1961 and played under that name until 1965, when it changed its name to ''California Angels'' upon its move from Los Angeles' [[Dodger Stadium]] to the new Anaheim Stadium (now Angel Stadium of Anaheim). In 1996, the Angels and the city of Anaheim agreed on a new lease that called for the city to fund renovations to Anaheim Stadium, and called for the team's name to contain the name "Anaheim". The following year, the team's official name changed again to ''Anaheim Angels''.

In 2005, the team was sold to [[Arte Moreno|Arturo "Arte" Moreno]]. Less than two years later, the team announced it was changing its name to ''Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim'', an attempt to market the team as being from [[Southern California]]—Major League Baseball's second-largest media market—rather than just [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]. The "of Anaheim" phrase was included to comply with the terms of the 1996 lease. Anaheim city officials immediately denounced the change, characterizing it as a breach of the lease, even though it was in technical compliance. Likewise, many fans denounced the change, as many Orange County residents consider Orange County to have its own identity separate from Los Angeles.

A [[preliminary injunction]] filed by the city seeking to immediately reverse the name change was unsuccessful, and the Angels began playing under the new name for the [[2007 Major League Baseball season|2007 season]].

One clause of the new lease required that the team name ''contain'' the name "Anaheim". There was precedent for the name "Anaheim" in a [[Major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada|major professional sports]] team name, as the [[National Hockey League|NHL's]] [[Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] (now known as the Anaheim Ducks), also owned by Disney, were enfranchised in 1993. Disney would acquire the remaining share of the team in {{mlby|1999}},&lt;ref name="DisneyMoreno" /&gt; less than a year after Gene Autry's death.

===Moreno ownership===
[[Image:Arte-Moreno.gif|thumb|200px|right|[[Arte Moreno]] (right) poses for a picture with an Angels fan.]]
Early in the {{baseball year|2003}} season, Disney sold the team to [[Arte Moreno|Arturo "Arte" Moreno]],&lt;ref name="DisneyMoreno" /&gt; a fourth-generation [[Mexican American]] [[billboard]] magnate from [[Arizona]]. Though he vowed to keep the team in Anaheim, starting in the 2004 season, all references to Anaheim began disappearing from the Angels players' uniforms, officially licensed merchandise, web site, ticket media, and promotional materials, and were replaced with "Angels", "Angels Baseball", or the Angels' [[wordmark]] or halo insignia.

On January 3, 2005 the Angels announced that the club's official name was being changed to ''Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim''.&lt;ref name="LAA_Announce"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://losangeles.angels.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20050103&amp;content_id=926747&amp;vkey=pr_ana&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=ana |title=Angels Baseball announces official name change |author=Los Angeles Angels |accessdate=13 February 2009 |publisher=MLB.com |date=3 January 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its official announcement, team spokesmen pointed out the Angels had been originally created as the American League's representative of the [[Greater Los Angeles area]], which comprises the counties of [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]], [[Ventura County, California|Ventura]], [[Riverside County, California|Riverside]], and [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino]], in addition to [[Orange County, California|Orange County]].&lt;ref name="LAA_Announce" /&gt;

New owner Moreno believed the new name would help him market the team to the entire [[Southern California]] region rather than just Orange County, thereby tapping into Major League Baseball's second largest media market.&lt;ref name="USAToday" /&gt; The ''of Anaheim'' phrase was included in the official name to comply with a provision of the team's lease at [[Angel Stadium of Anaheim|Angel Stadium]] which requires that the team's name "include the name Anaheim therein", although it was correctly anticipated that the team would be referred to as simply the "Los Angeles Angels" by the media and the majority of the public.

At the same time they announced the name change, the Angels aggressively marketed themselves to Los Angeles, buying space on nearly 500 billboards in the area that read simply "City of ANGELS" in the team's [[wordmark]].&lt;ref name="USAToday"&gt;{{cite news |last=Moore |first=David Leon |title=City of Angels ... and Dodgers |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2005-02-23-dodger-angels-cover_x.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129110332/http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2005-02-23-dodger-angels-cover_x.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 November 2005 |work=[[USA Today]] |date=23 February 2005 |accessdate=13 February 2009 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; The Dodgers, not wanting to give up any of its market share to the Angels, countered with their own billboard campaign, featuring the slogan "LA Baseball" (with "LA" depicted in the team's insignia),&lt;ref name="USAToday"/&gt; and putting ''Los Angeles Dodgers of Los Angeles'' on special giveaway merchandise for Opening Day 2005.

====Fan response====
The name change upset some fans from Orange County who did not wish to be associated with Los Angeles. It has been claimed that a cultural divide (the "[[Orange Curtain]]") exists between Orange County and Los Angeles; some fans suggested that Moreno, an Arizona native, did not take into account the alleged animosity between residents of the two counties when he attempted to restore the team's original name. Some fans wished for either the name to stay the same, or even for an alternate rename to the "Orange County Angels." Some fans made and sold unlicensed merchandise with messages such as "We are not LA" and "Anaheim Angels of Anaheim" {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}.

==Lawsuit==
[[Mayor of Anaheim, California|Anaheim Mayor]] [[Curt Pringle]] and other city officials asserted that the name change violated the spirit of the lease clause, even if it was in technical compliance. They argued that a name change was a major bargaining chip in negotiations between the city and Disney, and that the wording of the clause was merely to allow Disney some "wiggle room" in selecting the team name (Disney chairman [[Michael Eisner]] reportedly considered naming the team the ''[[The Mighty Ducks|Mighty]] Angels of Anaheim'').  They further argued that the city would never have agreed to the new lease without the name change, because the new lease required that the city partially fund the stadium's renovation while reducing annual revenue for the city. Anaheim sued Angels Baseball L.P. in Orange County Superior Court, seeking monetary damages and a restoration of the ''Anaheim Angels'' name. Concurrently, city politicians [[boycott]]ed the city's [[luxury suite]] at Angel Stadium, including during the Angels' [[2005 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|2005 playoff run]], opting instead to donate game tickets in the suite to various charities. A trial, initially set for November 7, 2005 was postponed until January 9, 2006.

In addition to the lawsuit brought by the city of Anaheim, the mayors of every [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] city, as well as the mayor of Los Angeles, signed a petition opposing the name change, while the [[city council]]s of Anaheim, [[Irvine, California|Irvine]], and Los Angeles adopted formal resolutions opposing the name change. The Los Angeles resolution specifically stated that the city only recognizes professional sports teams bearing the name "Los Angeles" as those whose home facilities are within the Los Angeles city limits, including the [[National League]]'s [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]], the [[National Basketball Association|NBA's]] [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] and [[Los Angeles Clippers|Clippers]], the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA's]] [[Los Angeles Sparks|Sparks]], the [[National Hockey League|NHL's]] [[Los Angeles Kings|Kings]], and the [[Arena Football League|Arena Football League's]] [[Los Angeles Avengers|Avengers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cityclerk.lacity.org/lacityclerkconnect/index.cfm?fa=vcfi.dsp_CFMS_Report&amp;rptid=99&amp;cfnumber=05-0002-S100|title=Resolution by the City Council: Truth in Sports Advertising Act / AB 1041 (Umberg)|last=Resolution by the City Council|first=|date=5 August 2005|website=Office of the City Clerk, City of Los Angeles|access-date=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] and the city of Los Angeles filed ''[[amicus curiae]]'' papers in Orange County Superior Court supporting Anaheim's position in its lawsuit against the team.

The city also sought a [[preliminary injunction]] to immediately reverse the name change in advance of the trial, which was rejected by the superior court judge. The city appealed the judge's ruling to the [http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search.cfm?dist=43|California Court of Appeal, Fourth District], which granted an unusual writ moving the city's case to the top of the docket and held a hearing on March 28, 2005. Though a ruling had been anticipated by April 7, 2005 the three judges of the appellate court merely urged the city and the team to work towards a settlement prior to trial.  The appellate court ruled against Anaheim's request for an injunction on June 27, 2005.

The case proceeded to jury trial on January 9, 2006, and on February 9, 2006, the jury found in favor of the team, determining that the ''Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim'' name was in compliance with the lease, and thus denying the city any monetary compensation.  Both citing the jury verdict finding the team in compliance and noting that his own conclusion agreed with that judgment, on March 2, 2006, the judge in the case formally denied the city's request to force the team to restore the ''Anaheim Angels'' name.

===Appeal===
On February 26, 2007, the city of Anaheim [[appeal]]ed the jury's decision, citing some testimony that it wanted to present but was not heard in the jury trial, and sought to recoup an estimated US$7 million in court costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizofbaseball.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=796&amp;Itemid=42 |work=The Biz of Baseball |title=City of Anaheim Files Appeal in Angels Lawsuit |date=27 February 2007 |accessdate=16 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406214303/http://www.bizofbaseball.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=796&amp;Itemid=42 |archivedate=6 April 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, 2008, a state [[appellate court]] issued a split decision denying the city's appeal and refusing to either set aside the jury's verdict or order the team to pay for the city's court costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shaikin |first=Bill |date=20 December 2008 |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/baseball/mlb/angels/la-spw-angels20-2008dec20,0,5859268.story |title=Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim win case to keep name |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=16 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116041513/http://www.latimes.com/sports/baseball/mlb/angels/la-spw-angels20-2008dec20%2C0%2C5859268.story |archivedate=January 16, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 13, 2009, Anaheim's city council voted not to further appeal the court's decisions, bringing a conclusion to the legal battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shaikin |first=Bill |date=14 January 2009 |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/baseball/mlb/angels/la-spw-angels14-2009jan14,0,3560927.story |title=Anaheim votes to end challenge to Angels' name change |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=16 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206101716/http://www.latimes.com/sports/baseball/mlb/angels/la-spw-angels14-2009jan14%2C0%2C3560927.story |archivedate=February 6, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Despite the legal victory, the team only uses its full name on official press releases and its website, and continues to market itself without direct reference to location wherever possible. Neither "Los Angeles" nor "Anaheim" appears on the team's uniforms or officially licensed merchandise or promotional materials; "Angels" or "Angels Baseball" are used instead. Major League Baseball and the national media have recognized the name change from the beginning, and team ownership correctly predicted that the national media and the general public would drop "of Anaheim" out of convenience and refer to the team as simply the "Los Angeles Angels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ballparksofbaseball.com/nl/wrig910.JPG |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406045936/http://ballparksofbaseball.com/nl/wrig910.JPG |archivedate=2007-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the prolonged legal battle, organized fan resistance to the new name subsided long before the appellate court ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tully |first=Sarah |author2=Courtney Bacalso |url=http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/news/atoz/article_1162182.php |work=[[Orange County Register]] |title=Extra innings for Angels suit |date=31 May 2006 |accessdate=16 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211212457/http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/news/atoz/article_1162182.php |archivedate=11 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://campusapps.fullerton.edu/news/2005/boyd.html |title=Q&amp;A: Angels Baseball Needs to Both Covet and Trust Fans |publisher=Cal State Fullerton Office of Public Affairs |date=7 April 2005 |accessdate=16 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011164304/http://campusapps.fullerton.edu/news/2005/boyd.html |archivedate=11 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name controversy and the city's suit and boycott did little to quell fan enthusiasm for the team, as Angel Stadium consistently drew over 3.3 million fans through its gates each season from 2004 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/attendance?sort=home_avg&amp;year=2004&amp;seasonType=2 |title=MLB Attendance Report - 2004 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also had little to no impact on the team's on-field performance—they won four [[American League West]] division titles over the same timespan, marking the most successful era in franchise history. The controversy also did little to negatively impact the perception of team ownership around the league, as evidenced by the Angels being selected to host the [[2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2010 All-Star Game]], with [[Commissioner of Baseball|MLB Commissioner]] [[Bud Selig]] calling the Angels a "model franchise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bloom |first=Barry |author2=Mike Scarr |title=Angels awarded 2010 All-Star Game |url=http://losangeles.angels.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080527&amp;content_id=2781201&amp;vkey=news_ana&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=ana |publisher=[[MLB.com]] |date=28 May 2008 |accessdate=13 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Angels' name change was the inspiration for the independent minor league [[Long Beach Armada]] baseball team's [[tongue-in-cheek]] name change to the ''Long Beach Armada of Los Angeles of California of the United States of North America Including [[Barrow, Alaska]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Long Beach Armada |url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=3482138 |title=Long Beach Armada Changes Official Name |work=OurSportsCentral.com |date=5 June 2007|accessdate=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Truth in Sports Advertising Act"===
On February 22, 2005, [[California State Assembly|California state assemblyman]] [[Tom Umberg]] introduced a truth in advertising bill ([http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/caasm/postquery?bill_number=ab_1041&amp;sess=CUR&amp;house=A&amp;author=umberg AB 1041]) in the State Assembly. If signed into law, the "Truth in Sports Advertising Act" would have required the Angels to disclose on all tickets and promotional materials that the team's home is Anaheim, not Los Angeles, unless Anaheim or Orange County exempted the franchise from the requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=ftp://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/05-06/bill/asm/ab_1001-1050/ab_1041_cfa_20050502_132004_asm_comm.html|title=Bill Analysis of AB 1041|last=California Assembly Committee on Arts, Entertainment, Sports, Tourism, and Internet Media|first=|date=3 May 2005|website=California Legislative Information|access-date=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 16, 2005, the bill passed the California Assembly by a margin of 52–17 and was sent to the [[California State Senate]] where, on May 26, 2005, it was referred to the Business, Professions and Economic Development Committee.

State Senate hearings scheduled on June 7 and June 27, 2005 were cancelled at the request of Assemblyman Umberg. On July 11, 2005, the hearing was postponed indefinitely by the Senate committee, effectively killing the bill.

The '''class A television service''' is a system for regulating some low-power [[television station|television]] ([[Low-power broadcasting|LPTV]]) stations in the United States. Class A stations are denoted by the [[broadcast callsign]] suffix "-CA" (analog) or "-CD" (digital), although very many analog -CA stations have a digital companion channel that was assigned the -LD suffix used by regular (non-class-A) digital LPTV stations.

The [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] created this category of service as a result of the '''Community Broadcasters Protection Act''' of 1999. Support for this ruling came largely from the [[Community Broadcasters Association]], an industry group representing low-power TV station operators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/mb/policy/lptv.html FCC, April 21, 1998, Petition for rulemaking for "CLASS A" TV service]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike traditional LPTV stations, class-A stations were given primary status during the [[digital television in the United States|transition to digital television]] (DTV), meaning that a full-service television station could not displace a class A LPTV station from its broadcast frequency ([[TV channel]]), except in rare cases. In contrast, traditional LPTV stations often found their frequencies assigned to full-service DTV operations, forcing them to relocate to another frequency. This was especially true in large cities, where available broadcast spectrum was scarce, and LPTV stations found themselves forced to cease operations due to no suitable spectrum.  This was especially so with the taking of the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band (channels 52 to 69) from the upper [[UHF]] TV band.

== Requirements ==
In exchange for the added broadcast protections, class-A stations are required to be more responsible in covering the community they serve. Class-A stations must:

* Broadcast a minimum of 18 hours per day
* Broadcast an average of at least three hours per week of programming produced within the [[media market]] area served by the station
* Be in compliance with the Commission's requirements for both LPTV stations and full-power television stations
* Broadcast on a core frequency (channels 2 - 51)
* Broadcast the minimum required amount of Children's "[[E/I]]" core programming
* Be capable of airing [[Emergency Alert System]] broadcasts when/if the need arises

An LPTV station could also qualify for class-A status if it follows the FCC's "[[public interest]], convenience, and necessity" standards.

== Limitations ==
A class-A television station may obtain a license to broadcast digitally at not more than 15 [[kilowatt|kW]] UHF or 3,000 [[watt]]s VHF, but is not required to do so. These are the same maximum power levels as for unprotected (secondary) [[low-power broadcasting|low-power television]] stations.

Unlike full-service stations, class-A television stations are not subject to limits on [[concentration of media ownership|common ownership]] which restrict full-power [[twinstick]] or [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] operations; they were required to [[analog shutdown|cease analog]] broadcasting [[DTV transition in the United States|in 2015]], as opposed to 2009 for full-power stations. They also were not required to [[simulcast]] their programming in analog and digital format during the US digital transition, unlike most full-service stations.

Despite the name of the [[Statute|act of law]] which created it, there is no requirement that a class-A station be an independent or community broadcaster, and some class-A stations are simply used as [[broadcast translator]]s for other stations.  In some communities, existing full-service broadcasters have operated an analog class A station together with a simulcast as a [[digital subchannel]] of a main full-service station, as a means to affiliate with two national [[TV network]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5427">'''Collective agreement coverage''' or '''union representation''' refers to the proportion of people in a country population whose terms and conditions at work are made by [[collective bargaining]], between an employer and a [[trade union]], rather than by individual [[contract]]s. This is invariably higher than the [[union membership rate]], because collective agreements almost always protect non-members in a unionised workplace. This means that, rather than individuals who have [[weaker bargaining power]] representing themselves in negotiations, people organise to represent each other together when negotiating for better pay and conditions in their workplace. The number of people who are covered by collective agreements is higher than the number of [[Union membership rate|union members]] (or the "[[union density]]" rate), and in many cases substantially higher, because when trade unions make collective agreements they aim to cover everyone at work, even those who have not necessarily joined for membership.

==Causes==
The causes of higher or lower collective bargaining coverage are widely debated. Common causes are often identified as including the following:

*whether a jurisdiction encourages [[sectoral collective bargaining]] (higher coverage) or [[enterprise bargaining]] (lower coverage)
*whether collective agreements to create a [[closed shop]] or allow [[automatic enrollment]] in union membership are lawful
*whether laws on collective bargaining and strikes are more or less favourable
*whether the government, for instance through a [[Ministry of Labour|Ministry]] or [[Department of Labour]], actively promotes collective agreement coverage with a power to impose terms if employers refuse to bargain with the workforce
*whether a country enables collective agreements to be extended by government regulations to all workers when the coverage rate reaches a majority in a sector, or similar level

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23554">'''Official texts''', as defined in Article 2(4) of the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]], are texts of a legislative, administrative and legal nature (e.g. statute laws, administrative regulations and court decisions) and the official translations of such texts.

The Convention indicates that it shall be left to the discretion of each member country of the Berne Convention to determine the protection to be granted to such official texts in that country.

Generally, member countries of the Convention include official texts in the [[public domain]]. However, the governments of the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth countries claim a [[Crown copyright]] in their works. Many republics of the Commonwealth also copyright their official works, though they have no crown copyright.

{{sociology}}
'''Critical theory''' is a [[school of thought]] that stresses the reflective assessment and [[critique]] of [[society]] and [[culture]] by applying knowledge from the [[social sciences]] and the [[humanities]]. As a term, ''critical theory'' has two meanings with different origins and histories: the first originated in [[sociology]] and the second originated in [[literary criticism]], whereby it is used and applied as an [[umbrella term]] that can describe a theory founded upon [[critique]]; thus, the theorist [[Max Horkheimer]] described a theory as critical insofar as it seeks "to liberate human beings from the circumstances that enslave them".&lt;ref&gt;(Horkheimer 1982, 244)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sociology]] and [[political philosophy]], the term "Critical Theory"&lt;!--capitalized--&gt; describes the [[Western Marxism|neo-Marxist philosophy]] of the [[Frankfurt School]], which was developed in Germany in the 1930s. This use of the term requires proper noun capitalization, whereas "a critical theory" or "a critical social theory" may have similar elements of thought, but not stress its intellectual lineage specifically to the Frankfurt School.  Frankfurt School critical theorists drew on the critical methods of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. Critical theory maintains that [[ideology]] is the principal obstacle to human liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Geuss, R. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=oS47wcTHj2EC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Idea of a Critical Theory]'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical theory was established as a school of thought primarily by the Frankfurt School theoreticians [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], [[Walter Benjamin]], and [[Erich Fromm]]. Modern critical theory has additionally been influenced by [[György Lukács]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]], as well as the second generation Frankfurt School scholars, notably [[Jürgen Habermas]]. In Habermas's work, critical theory transcended its theoretical roots in [[German idealism]] and progressed closer to [[Pragmatism|American pragmatism]]. Concern for social "[[base and superstructure]]" is one of the remaining [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist]] philosophical concepts in much of contemporary critical theory.&lt;ref name="Outhwaite, William 1988. pp. 5-8"&gt;Outhwaite, William. 1988. ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'' 2nd Edition (2009), pp. 5-8 ({{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}})&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Postmodern]] critical theory politicizes social problems "by situating them in historical and cultural contexts, to implicate themselves in the process of collecting and analyzing data, and to relativize their findings".&lt;ref name="LINDTAYLOR"/&gt;

==Overview&lt;!--'Critical social theory' and 'Critical sociology' redirect here--&gt;==
Critical theory ({{lang-de|Kritische Theorie}}) was first defined by [[Max Horkheimer]] of the [[Frankfurt School]] of sociology in his 1937 essay ''Traditional and Critical Theory'': Critical Theory is a social theory oriented toward critiquing and changing [[society]] as a whole, in contrast to traditional theory oriented only to understanding or explaining it. Horkheimer wanted to distinguish critical theory as a radical, emancipatory form of [[Marxist philosophy|Marxian]] theory, critiquing both the model of science put forward by [[logical positivism]] and what he and his colleagues saw as the covert positivism and authoritarianism of orthodox [[Marxism]] and [[Communism]]. He described a theory as critical insofar as it seeks "to liberate human beings from the circumstances that enslave them".&lt;ref&gt;Horkheimer 1982, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical theory involves a [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] dimension, either through criticizing society from some general theory of [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], norms, or "oughts", or through criticizing it in terms of its own espoused values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2016/entries/critical-theory/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Bohman|first=James|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core concepts of critical theory are as follows:
# That critical social theory should be directed at the totality of society in its historical specificity (i.e. how it came to be configured at a specific point in time), and
# That critical theory should improve understanding of society by integrating all the major social sciences, including [[geography]], [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[history]], [[political science]], [[anthropology]], and [[psychology]].

This version of "critical" theory derives from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s (18th-century) and Marx's (19th-century) use of the term "[[critique]]", as in Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and Marx's concept that his work ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (''Capital'') forms a "critique of political economy". For Kant's [[transcendental idealism]], "critique" means examining and establishing the limits of the validity of a faculty, type, or body of knowledge, especially through accounting for the limitations imposed by the fundamental, irreducible concepts in use in that knowledge system.

Kant's notion of critique has been associated with the overturning of false, unprovable, or dogmatic philosophical, social, and political beliefs, because Kant's critique of reason involved the critique of dogmatic [[theological]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] ideas and was intertwined with the enhancement of ethical autonomy and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] critique of superstition and irrational authority. Ignored by many in "critical realist" circles, however, is that Kant's immediate impetus for writing his "Critique of Pure Reason" was to address problems raised by [[David Hume]]'s skeptical empiricism which, in attacking metaphysics, employed reason and logic to argue against the knowability of the world and common notions of causation. Kant, by contrast, pushed the employment of a priori metaphysical claims as requisite, for if anything is to be said to be knowable, it would have to be established upon abstractions distinct from perceivable phenomena.

Marx explicitly developed the notion of critique into the [[critique of ideology]] and linked it with the practice of social revolution, as stated in the famous 11th of his ''[[Theses on Feuerbach]]'': "The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/theses.htm |title=Theses on Feuerbach |others=§XI |publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]] |accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the distinguishing characteristics of critical theory, as Adorno and Horkheimer elaborated in their ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' (1947), is a certain ambivalence concerning the ultimate source or foundation of social domination, an ambivalence which gave rise to the "[[pessimism]]" of the new critical theory over the possibility of human emancipation and [[Political freedom|freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, T. W., with Max Horkheimer. ''Dialectic of Enlightenment''. Trans. Edmund Jephcott. Stanford: Stanford UP, 2002. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; This ambivalence was rooted, of course, in the historical circumstances in which the work was originally produced, in particular, the rise of [[Nazism|National Socialism]], [[state capitalism]], and [[mass culture]] as entirely new forms of social domination that could not be adequately explained within the terms of traditional Marxist sociology.&lt;ref&gt;"Critical Theory was initially developed in Horkheimer's circle to think through political disappointments at the absence of revolution in the West, the development of Stalinism in Soviet Russia, and the victory of fascism in Germany. It was supposed to explain mistaken Marxist prognoses, but without breaking Marxist intentions." "The Entwinement of Myth and Enlightenment: Horkheimer and Adorno." in Habermas, Jürgen. ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Twelve Lectures''. trans. Frederick Lawrence. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1987. 116. Also, see Helmut Dubiel, ''Theory and Politics: Studies in the Development of Critical Theory'', trans. Benjamin Gregg (Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

For Adorno and Horkheimer, [[state intervention]] in economy had effectively abolished the tension between the "[[relations of production]]" and "material [[productive forces]] of society", a tension which, according to traditional critical theory, constituted the primary [[contradiction]] within capitalism. The market (as an "unconscious" mechanism for the distribution of goods) and [[private property]] had been replaced by [[centralized planning]] and socialized ownership of the [[means of production]].&lt;ref&gt;"[G]one are the objective laws of the market which ruled in the actions of the entrepreneurs and tended toward catastrophe. Instead the conscious decision of the managing directors executes as results (which are more obligatory than the blindest price-mechanisms) the old law of value and hence the destiny of capitalism." ''Dialectic of Enlightenment''. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, contrary to Marx's famous prediction in the ''Preface to a Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'', this shift did not lead to "an era of [[social revolution]]", but rather to [[fascism]] and [[totalitarianism]]. As such, critical theory was left, in [[Jürgen Habermas]]' words, without "anything in reserve to which it might appeal; and when the forces of production enter into a baneful symbiosis with the relations of production that they were supposed to blow wide open, there is no longer any dynamism upon which critique could base its hope".&lt;ref&gt;"The Entwinement of Myth and Enlightenment," p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; For Adorno and Horkheimer, this posed the problem of how to account for the apparent persistence of domination in the absence of the very contradiction that, according to traditional critical theory, was the source of domination itself.

In the 1960s, [[Jürgen Habermas]], a proponent of '''critical social theory'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;George N. Katsiaficas, Robert George Kirkpatrick, Mary Lou Emery, ''Introduction to Critical Sociology'', Irvington Publishers, 1987, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; raised the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] discussion to a new level in his ''Knowledge and Human Interests'', by identifying critical [[knowledge]] as based on principles that differentiated it either from the [[natural sciences]] or the [[humanities]], through its orientation to self-reflection and emancipation. Although unsatisfied with Adorno and Horkeimer's thought presented in ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'', Habermas shares the view that, in the form of [[instrumental rationality]], the era of [[modernity]] marks a move away from the liberation of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] and toward a new form of enslavement.&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William. 1988. ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'' 2nd Edition
(2009). p6. {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Habermas's work, critical theory transcended its theoretical roots in [[German idealism]], and progressed closer to [[Pragmatism|American pragmatism]].

Habermas is now influencing the [[philosophy of law]] in many countries—for example the creation of the social philosophy of law in Brazil, and his theory also has the potential to make the discourse of law one important institution of the modern world as a heritage of the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Bittar, Eduardo C. B., ''Democracia, Justiça e Emancipação Social'', São Paulo, Quartier Latin, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

His ideas regarding the relationship between modernity and [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] are in this sense strongly influenced by [[Max Weber]]. Habermas dissolved further the elements of critical theory derived from [[Hegelian]] [[German Idealism]], although his thought remains broadly Marxist in its epistemological approach. Perhaps his two most influential ideas are the concepts of the [[public sphere]] and [[communicative action]]; the latter arriving partly as a reaction to new [[post-structural]] or so-called "[[Postmodernism|postmodern]]" challenges to the discourse of modernity. Habermas engaged in regular correspondence with [[Richard Rorty]] and a strong sense of philosophical [[pragmatism]] may be felt in his theory; thought which frequently traverses the boundaries between sociology and philosophy.

==Critical theory and academic fields==
===Postmodern critical social theory===
While [[modernist]] critical theory (as described above) concerns itself with "forms of authority and injustice that accompanied the evolution of industrial and [[corporate capitalism]] as a political-economic system", [[postmodern]] critical theory politicizes social problems "by situating them in historical and cultural contexts, to implicate themselves in the process of collecting and analyzing data, and to relativize their findings".&lt;ref name="LINDTAYLOR"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindlof|first1=Thomas R.|last2=Taylor|first2=Bryan C.|title=Qualitative Communication Research Methods|date=2002|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9780761924944|page=49|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Op-GRnkSCGgC&amp;q=forms+of+authority+and+injustice+that+accompanied+the+evolution+of+industrial+and+corporate+capitalism+as+a+political-economic+system#v=snippet&amp;q=forms%20of%20authority%20and%20injustice%20that%20accompanied%20the%20evolution%20of%20industrial%20and%20corporate%20capitalism%20as%20a%20political-economic%20system&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meaning itself is seen as unstable due to the rapid transformation in social structures. As a result, the focus of research is centered on local manifestations, rather than broad generalizations.

Postmodern critical research is also characterized by the ''crisis of representation'', which rejects the idea that a researcher's work is an "objective depiction of a stable other". Instead, many postmodern scholars have adopted "alternatives that encourage reflection about the 'politics and poetics' of their work. In these accounts, the embodied, collaborative, dialogic, and improvisational aspects of qualitative research are clarified".&lt;ref&gt;Lindlof &amp; Taylor, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;53&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "critical theory" is often appropriated when an author works within sociological terms, yet attacks the social or human sciences (thus attempting to remain "outside" those frames of inquiry). [[Michel Foucault]] is one of these authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rivera Vicencio|first1=E.|title=Foucault: His influence over accounting and management research. Building of a map of Foucault's approach|journal=Int. J. Critical Accounting|date=2012|volume=4|issue=5/6|pages=728–756|url=http://www.inderscience.com/info/inarticle.php?artid=51466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Baudrillard]] has also been described as a critical theorist to the extent that he was an unconventional and critical sociologist;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/postmodernism/modules/baudrillardpostmodernity.html|title=Introduction to Jean Baudrillard, Module on Postmodernity|website=www.cla.purdue.edu|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; this appropriation is similarly casual, holding little or no relation to the Frankfurt School.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/baudrillard/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Kellner|first=Douglas|date=2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jürgen Habermas]] of [[The Frankfurt School]] is one of the key critics of postmodernism.&lt;ref name="STAN"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aylesworth|first1=Gary|title=Postmodernism|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/postmodernism/#9|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=24 June 2017|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical theory is focused on language, symbolism, communication, and [[social construction]].

===Communication studies===
From the 1960s and 1970s onward, language, symbolism, text, and meaning came to be seen as the theoretical foundation for the [[humanities]], through the influence of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Jacques Derrida]] and other thinkers in linguistic and analytic philosophy, [[structural linguistics]], [[symbolic interactionism]], [[hermeneutics]], [[semiology]], linguistically oriented psychoanalysis ([[Jacques Lacan]], [[Alfred Lorenzer]]), and [[deconstruction]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

When, in the 1970s and 1980s, [[Jürgen Habermas]] redefined critical social theory as a [[Communication studies|study of communication]], i.e. communicative competence and communicative rationality on the one hand, distorted communication on the other, the two versions of critical theory began to overlap to a much greater degree than before.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

===Pedagogy===
Critical theorists have widely credited [[Paulo Freire]] for the first applications of critical theory towards education/[[pedagogy]]. They consider his best-known work, ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]'', a seminal text in what is now known as the philosophy and social movement of [[critical pedagogy]]. For a history of the emergence of critical theory in the field of education, see Isaac Gottesman (2016), ''The Critical Turn in Education: From Marxist Critique to Postructuralist Feminism to Critical Theories of Race'' (New York: Routledge).

==Criticism==
While critical theorists have been frequently defined as Marxist intellectuals,&lt;ref name="Kołakowski"&gt;See, e.g., [[Leszek Kołakowski]]'s ''[[Main Currents of Marxism]]'' (1979), vol. 3 chapter X; W. W. Norton &amp; Company, {{ISBN|0393329437}}&lt;/ref&gt; their tendency to denounce some Marxist concepts and to combine Marxian analysis with other sociological and philosophical traditions has resulted in accusations of [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]] by [[Classical Marxism|classical]], [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox]], and [[Analytical Marxism|analytical]] Marxists, and by [[Marxist–Leninist]] philosophers. [[Martin Jay]] has stated that the first generation of critical theory is best understood as not promoting a specific philosophical agenda or a specific [[ideology]], but as "a [[Social gadfly|gadfly]] of other systems".&lt;ref name="Martin Jay"&gt;Jay, Martin (1996) ''The Dialectical Imagination: A History of the Frankfurt School and the Institute of Social Research, 1923–1950''. University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0-520-20423-2}}, [https://books.google.com/?id=nwkzVdaaB2sC&amp;dq=%22gadfly+of+other+systems%22&amp;pg=PA41 p. 41]&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical theory has been criticized for not offering any clear road map to political action following critique, often explicitly repudiating any solutions (such as with Herbert Marcuse's concept of "the Great Refusal", which promoted abstaining from engaging in active political change).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/frankfur/#SH2a "The Frankfurt School and Critical Theory"], Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department of Justice''' ({{lang-fr|Ministère de la Justice}}) is the [[Ministry (government department)|department]] of the [[Government of Canada]] that represents the Canadian government in legal matters. The purpose of the department is to ensure that the [[Canadian justice system]] is fair, accessible and efficient. Almost all lawyers in the federal government are employed by the Department of Justice, and they are dispatched to manage the legal affairs of the other departments and agencies.

While the role of the [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]] has existed since 1867, the department was not created until 1868. The headquarters of the Department of Justice is located in [[Ottawa]] at St. Andrew's Tower (275 [[Sparks Street]]), a modern low rise office tower built in 1987.

The current Minister of Justice (and [[Attorney General of Canada]]) is [[Jody Wilson-Raybould]].

==History ==
[[File:Canadian Dept of Justice entrance Dec 2005.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Sparks Street]] headquarters in [[Ottawa]]]]
At the time of [[Canadian confederation|Confederation]] in 1867, the [[Province of Canada]] had two Crown Law Departments, one for Canada West (now Ontario) and one for Canada East (now Quebec). At Confederation, the Crown Law Department, Canada West began to act as the new Department of Justice, reporting to [[Sir John A. Macdonald]], who was Minister of Justice, Attorney General, and the new Prime Minister. The Crown Law Department, Canada East became the new Department of the Militia, following its former Attorney General, [[George-Étienne Cartier]].

The Department of Justice [[coming into force|came into being]] in May 1868, when the [[Department of Justice Act]] was passed by Parliament. The Act formally recognized the informal structure that was already in place. The Act also laid out the distinct roles of the Minister of Justice and the Attorney General: the Minister was a partisan political adviser to the Crown, while the Attorney General provided legal services.

The new Department of Justice had only seven staff: two barristers-at-law (including the Deputy Minister, [[Hewitt Bernard]]), a clerk and shorthand writer (Macdonald's personal secretary), a copy clerk, a clerk articling under Macdonald, and two messengers.

The legal branch of the department remained relatively small for many years. As late as 1939, the Department employed only seven lawyers. The department's first woman lawyer, Henrietta Bourque, was hired in 1939, but the department remained heavily male-dominated. In the 25 years between 1939 and 1964, only five female lawyers were hired by the department.

Although the Department of Justice Act had given the department responsibility for all litigation for or against the government, many government departments hired their own lawyers to provide them with legal advice. In 1962, however, these departmental lawyers were brought together in a common legal service. Although many lawyers still work closely with other government departments in departmental legal services units, they are now considered to be employees of the Department of Justice.

Regional offices were opened in Montreal (1965), Toronto (1966), Vancouver (1967), Winnipeg (1969), Halifax, Edmonton, Saskatoon, the Northwest Territories, and Iqaluit (Nunavut). The Department of Justice co-chaired the [[Interdepartmental Working Group on Trafficking in Persons]] with the [[Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development]] from 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|page=99|title=Combatting Trafficking in Persons: A Handbook for Parliamentarians|publisher=[[United Nations]]|year=2009|edition=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography|page=2|publisher=[[Canadian Coalition for the Rights of Children]]|date=October 5, 2012|url=http://rightsofchildren.ca/wp-content/uploads/CCRC-Response-to-List-of-Issues-on-OPSC.pdf|accessdate=October 21, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022054200/http://rightsofchildren.ca/wp-content/uploads/CCRC-Response-to-List-of-Issues-on-OPSC.pdf|archivedate=October 22, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The department employs 5,000 people, nearly half of whom are lawyers, in offices across the country mostly under the [[Public Prosecution Service of Canada]].

The '''Electrohippies Collective (Ehippies)''' is an international group of internet activists based in Oxfordshire, England, whose purpose is to express disapproval of governmental policies of mass media censorship and control of the Internet "in order to provide a 'safe environment' for corporations to do their deals." &lt;ref name=cyberlaw&gt;''[http://www.iwar.org.uk/hackers/resources/electrohippies-collective/comm-2000-12.pdf Cyberlaw UK: Civil rights and protest on the Internet]''(PDF) December 2000 communiqué of Electrohippies Collective&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significant actions==

===Against the WTO, 1999===
The protest against the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in [[Seattle]] in 1999 was a signal event in the anti-globalisation movement. Thousands of people gathered to disrupt the World Trade Organisation conference by preventing delegates from entering the conference venue.&lt;ref name=jordan&gt;Jordan T &amp; Taylor P ''Hactivism and Cyber War, Rebel with a Cause?'' Routledge, New York 2004&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.41}} Simultaneously, an online direct protest was run by The Electrohippies Collective with what is now a familiar aspect of cyber space: a [[denial-of-service]] (DOS) action. This tactic blocked the [[computer network]] servicing the WTO meeting by flooding it with requests. The Ehippies claimed success for the action, saying 450,000 people participated over 5 days, resulting in the WTO conference network being constantly slowed and periodically brought to a halt.

Their claim was disputed by staff of Conxion, the ISP hosting the conference website, who deployed a [[URL rewriting]] rule to redirect attack traffic to the attack page itself. It was claimed that this [[counter-attack]] "[[Crash (computing)|crashed]]" the Ehippies' server within seconds, forcing them to move to another ISP. The majority of hits to the Ehippies' site were thus their own attack page attacking itself. Conxion claimed to have logged fewer than 10,000 unique-source IP addresses. The attack page consisted of nine frames, three attacking the San Jose conference server, three against the Virginia server and three against the main WTO server. The Chicago conference server was not attacked and remained entirely unaffected. However, the WTO main website server, hosted by another provider, did not benefit from the rewrite-engine fix and did suffer significantly from the DOS attack.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliff D ''[http://www.networkworld.com/research/2000/0529feat2.html Hack Back]'' 29 May 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ehippies justified their campaign tactic as enabling tens of thousands of remote [[computer]] users to join the Seattle protest action. They pointed out that the action could not have worked without the support of sufficient people—purporting to demonstrate that there was significant support for their action.&lt;ref name=jordan/&gt;{{rp|p.77}}

===Against the IMF/WB, 2000===
As a follow-up to their WTO action, the Ehippies and volunteers tried to shut down the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and [[World Bank]] websites by a "virtual sit-in" in conjunction with 'real world' protests in [[Washington, D.C.]] in April 2000. Some 5000 online participants were able to cause only intermittent slowdowns on those sites.&lt;ref name=jordan/&gt;{{rp|p.25}}

===Response to 'anti-terror' laws===
The collective was forced to subside temporarily into inaction by the [[United Kingdom|British]] government's [[Terrorism Act 2000|The Terrorism Act 2000]] and The Regulation of Investigatory Power Act 2000, perceived as significantly changing the right of British citizens to freely use the internet for political and protest action.&lt;ref name=cyberlaw/&gt; Now it "focusses on the use of technology by activists, mainly through organising workshops and quietly assisting 'behind the scenes' of other campaigns. Current campaigns are the "[http://www.fraw.org.uk/fraw/simple/index.shtml Simple]" energy-focused campaign and the "[http://www.fraw.org.uk/fraw/browser_alert/index.shtml Browser Alert]" campaign against proprietary software abuses and [[Digital rights management]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7764">An '''exempt charity''' is an institution established in [[England and Wales]] for [[Charitable organization|charitable purposes]] which is exempt from registration with, and oversight by, the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales]].

Exempt charities are largely institutions of further and higher education, universities, [[industrial and provident society|industrial and provident societies]], [[friendly society|friendly societies]], or national museums, that were established by Act of Parliament or by Royal Charter. These organisations are specified in Schedule 3 to the [[Charities Act 2011]].

Historically, they were treated as exempt from supervision because they were considered to be adequately supervised by, or accountable to, some other body or authority, such as Parliament. However this supervision was not always formalised, and the [[Charities Act 2006]] (which was consolidated into the 2011 Act) introduced the idea of "principal regulator" for exempt charities.   Where a previously exempt charity had no principal regulator it would become subject to registration with, and regulation by, the Charity Commission.

Although outside the jurisdiction of the Charity Commission, exempt charities are still subject to the usual legal rules applicable to charities in [[English law]] and to the general provisions of the Charities Acts, and may seek advice from the Charity Commission

==Named charities==

A '''facial composite''' is a graphical representation of one or more [[Witness|eyewitness]]es' memory of a face, as recorded by a composite artist. Facial composites are used mainly by police in their investigation of (usually serious) crimes. These images are also used to reconstruct the suspect's face in hope of identifying them.

==Methods==

===PhotoFIT generation===
Construction of the composite was originally performed by a trained artist, through drawing, sketching, or painting, in consultation with a witness or crime victim. Subsequently, techniques were devised for use by those less artistically skilled, employing interchangeable templates of separate facial features. The first such mechanical system, called "Identikit", was introduced in the U.S. in 1959; it used drawings of facial features on transparent acetate sheets that could be superimposed on one another to produce the composite image.&lt;ref name="Davies-Valentine"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=Graham M. |last2=Valentine |first2=Tim |chapter=Facial Composites: Forensic Utility and Psychological Research |title=Handbook of Eyewitness Psychology |editor=Rod C. L. Lindsay, et al. (Eds.)|date=2006 |place=Mahwah, NJ |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |isbn=9780805851526 |doi=10.4324/9781315805535 |volume=Vol. 2 ''Memory for People'' |at=Section, "Mechanical Systems" |via=''Routledge Handbooks Online'' (2014) |chapter-url=https://www.routledgehandbooks.com/doi/10.4324/9781315805535}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A later version of Identikit is made by [[Smith &amp; Wesson]].) In 1970, a system called "Photofit", which aimed for greater realism by using actual photographs of facial features, was introduced in the U.K.&lt;ref name="Davies-Valentine"/&gt;

In the last two decades, a number of computer based facial composite systems have been introduced; amongst the most widely used systems are SketchCop FACETTE Face Design System Software, "Identi-Kit 2000", FACES, [[E-FIT]] and PortraitPad. In the U.S. the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] maintains that hand-drawing is its preferred method for constructing a facial composite. Many other police agencies, however, use software, since suitable artistic talent is often not available.

===Evolutionary systems===
Until quite recently, the facial composite systems used by international police forces were exclusively based on a construction methodology in which individual facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, eyebrows, etc.) are selected one at a time from a large database and then electronically 'overlaid' to make the composite image. Such systems are often referred to as feature-based since they essentially rely on the selection of individual features in isolation. However, after a long period of research and development work conducted largely within British universities, systems based on a rather different principle are finding increasing use by police forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frowd |first=C.

==Research==
A general review of research into the evaluation of mechanical template techniques may be found in Davies and Valentine (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davies |first=G.

(2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frowd |first=C. D. |last2=Bruce |first2=V. |last3=Hancock |first3=P. J. B. |year=2008 |title=Changing the face of criminal identification |journal=The Psychologist |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=670–672 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frowd |first=C.

The systems used in the UK have been subjected to a number of academic studies. These have typically shown that E-FIT and PRO-fit produce composites that are correctly named, either immediately or a few hours after construction, about 20% of the time (see Brace et al. (2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brace |first=N. |last2=Pike |first2=G. |last3=Kemp |first3=R. |year=2000 |chapter=Investigating E-FIT using famous faces |title=Forensic Psychology and Law |editor1-first=A. |editor1-last=Czerederecka |editor2-first=T. |editor2-last=Jaskiewicz-Obydzinska |editor3-first=J. |editor3-last=Wojcikiewicz |pages=272–276 |publisher=Krakow Institute of Forensic Research Publishers |location= |isbn=978-0-470-09623-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bruce et al.

When witnesses in these studies are required to wait two days before constructing a composite, which matches real use more closely, naming falls to a few percent at best (e.g. Frowd et al. [2005]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frowd |first=C. D. |last2=Carson |first2=D. |last3=Ness |first3=H. |last4=McQuiston |first4=D. |last5=Richardson |first5=J. |last6=Baldwin |first6=H. |last7=Hancock |first7=P. J.

The reason for the low level of naming from these systems appears to be that witnesses are unable to accurately construct the internal features of the face after long delays, the region that is important for recognition by another person later (Frowd et al. [2007]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frowd |first=C. D. |last2=Bruce |first2=V. |last3=McIntyre |first3=A. |last4=Hancock |first4=P. J.

Evolutionary systems show a marked improvement in accuracy. In academic trials, research on a fairly-recent version of the EvoFIT system has shown correct naming levels of about 30% after a 2-day delay (see Frowd et al., 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frowd |first=C.

This latest police field trial has also indicated that an EvoFIT directly leads to the arrest of a suspect and then a conviction in 29% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frowd |first=C.

==Usage==
[[File:Aafia Siddiqui 2.png|thumb|right|Facial composite of [[Aafia Siddiqui]], created by the FBI for a wanted poster&lt;ref name="emma"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Scroggins|first= Deborah|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6507794_ITM|title=The Most Wanted Woman in the World|publisher=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], reprinted by 'Access My Library'|format=Limited access, subscription required|date=March 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While the classic use of the facial composite is the citizen recognizing the face as an acquaintance, there are other ways where a facial composite can prove useful. The facial composite can contribute in law enforcement in a number of ways:

# Identifying the suspect in a [[wanted poster]].
# Additional evidence against a suspect.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
# Assisting investigation in checking leads.
# Warning vulnerable population against serial offenders.

Facial composites of various types have been used extensively in those television programs which aim to reconstruct major unsolved crimes with a view to gaining information from the members of the public, such as "[[America's Most Wanted]]" in the US and "[[Crimewatch]]" in the UK.

==Notable cases==
These notable cases had facial composites assist in identifying the perpetrator:
* [[Oklahoma City]] bomber [[Timothy McVeigh]].
* [[Niklas Lindgren]], also known as "Hagamannen", a serial sexual assaulter in [[Umeå]].
* [[Baton Rouge]] serial killer [[Derrick Todd Lee]].
* [[Manchester]] serial rapist Asim Javed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2019031/Evo-fit-New-facial-identification-technology-helps-catch-rapist-Asim-Javed.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Jaya | last=Narain | title=The changing face of crime: Powerful new Evo-fit technology helps catch rapist | date=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fisheries law''' is an emerging and specialized area of law. Fisheries law is the study and analysis of different [[fisheries management]] approaches such as catch shares e.g. [[Individual Transferable Quotas]]; TURFs; and others. The study of fisheries law is important in order to craft [[Environmental policy|policy]] guidelines that maximize [[Sustainability of fisheries|sustainability]] and legal enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Fisheries Service, available at http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/aboutus.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This specific legal area is rarely taught at law schools around the world, which leaves a vacuum of advocacy and research. Fisheries law also takes into account [[international treaties]] and [[Fishing industry|industry]] norms in order to analyze fisheries management regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Kevern L. Cochrane, A Fishery Manager’s Guidebook: Management Measures and their Application, Fisheries Technical Paper 424, available at ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/004/y3427e/y3427e00.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, fisheries law includes access to justice for small-scale fisheries and coastal and [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] communities and labor issues such as child labor laws, employment law, and family law.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Stewart, Oceanography in the 21st Century – An Online Textbook, Fisheries Issues, available at http://oceanworld.tamu.edu/resources/oceanography-book/fisheriesissues.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Another important area of research covered in fisheries law is seafood safety. Each country, or region, around the world has a varying degree of seafood safety standards and regulations. These regulations can contain a large diversity of fisheries management schemes including quota or catch share systems.  It is important to study seafood safety regulations around the world in order to craft policy guidelines from countries who have implemented effective schemes. Also, this body of research can identify areas of improvement for countries who have not yet been able to master efficient and effective seafood safety regulations.

Fisheries law also includes the study of [[aquaculture]] laws and regulations.  Aquaculture, also known as aquafarming, is the farming of aquatic organisms, such as fish and aquatic plants. This body of research also encompasses animal feed regulations and requirements. It is important to regulate what feed is consumed by fish in order to prevent risks to human health and safety.

=== U.S. Labeling of Genetically Engineered Salmon ===

On November 19, 2015, the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved AquaBounty Technologies’ application to sell the [[AquAdvantage salmon]] to U.S. consumers.&lt;ref&gt;FDA, ''AquAdvantage Salmon Approval Letter and Appendix'' (November 19, 2015), online: U.S. Food and Drug Administration &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.fda.gov&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The possible introduction of genetically engineered salmon into the marketplace furthers discussion involving ethics, protection of the natural environment, international and domestic trade law, labeling practices, nutrition, and constitutional issues. As the FDA points out, nutrition labeling for raw produce (fruits and vegetables), fish, and genetically modified products, is voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;FDA, ''Labeling &amp; Nutrition'', online: U.S. Food and Drug Administration &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.fda.gov&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Under section 403(a)(1) of the ''[[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act|Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]]'' ("FD&amp;C Act"), a food is misbranded if its labeling is “false or misleading in any particular”.&lt;ref&gt;21 U.S.C. § 343(a)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; Section 201(n) of the FD&amp;C Act provides that labeling is misleading if it fails to reveal facts that are material in light of representations made or suggested in the labeling.&lt;ref&gt;21 U.S.C. § 321(n).&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to the AquAdvantage salmon, the FDA has stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Based on our assessments of food derived from the AquAdvantage Salmon, we have determined that the term “Atlantic salmon” is the appropriate common or usual name for such food within the meaning of section 403(i) of the FD&amp;C Act because AquAdvantage Salmon meets FDA’s regulatory standard for Atlantic salmon (Ref. 10) and the composition and basic nature of food from AquAdvantage Salmon does not significantly differ from its non-GE counterpart—non-GE farm-raised Atlantic salmon. In addition, we have determined that food derived from AquAdvantage Salmon is as safe and nutritious as food from other farm-raised Atlantic salmon. For these reasons, we have concluded that there is no material difference between food derived from AquAdvantage Salmon and food derived from other non-GE, farm-raised Atlantic salmon that is required to be disclosed in the labeling of food derived from AquAdvantage Salmon under the relevant provisions of the FD&amp;C Act, as explained above."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation/ucm059098.htm|title=Draft Guidance for Industry: Voluntary Labeling Indicating Whether Food Has or Has Not Been Derived From Genetically Engineered Atlantic Salmon|last=|first=|date=November 19, 2015|website=Food|publisher=US FDA|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Canadian Labeling of Genetically Engineered Salmon ====
In 2014, Canada was a top-five producer of GM crops in the world, and is one of the largest players on the global market.&lt;ref&gt;ISAAA, ''Beyond Promises: Top 10 Facts about Biotech/GM Crops in 2014'', online: ISAA &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.isaaa.org&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Health Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency ("CFIA") carry joint responsibility for federally food labeling policies in Canada under the ''Food and Drugs Act'' ("F&amp;D Act").&lt;ref&gt;RSC 1985, c. F-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the F&amp;D Act, GMOs are defined as “novel foods”. A novel food is allowed to enter the Canadian marketplace only after it has passed an assessment undertaken by various stakeholders. Health Canada is responsible for deciding all health and safety labeling policies for food products, such as special dietary needs or GM products, and ensuring that the products are safe for consumption.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Government of Canada, ''Labelling of Genetically Engineered Foods in Canada'', online: Canadian Food Inspection Agency &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.inspection.gc.ca&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040403234714/http://www.inspection.gc.ca/ |date=April 3, 2004 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The CFIA is responsible for the development of all non-health and safety food labeling regulations and policies and the enforcement of labeling legislation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Standards are set by the CFIA so that Canadian food labels are truthful and not misleading.

Subsection 5(1) of the F&amp;D Act states that “no person shall label, package, treat, process, sell or advertise any food in a manner that is false, misleading or deceptive or is likely to create an erroneous impression regarding its character, value, quantity, composition, merit or safety”. Food must be labelled only if there are changes in the food such as problematic allergens or a significant nutrient or compositional change. Health Canada has not released an official statement concerning the AquAdvantage salmon, but does state on its website: “after twelve years of reviewing the safety of novel foods, Health Canada is not aware of any published scientific evidence demonstrating that novel foods are any less safe than traditional foods. The regulatory framework put in place by the federal government ensures that new and modified foods can be safely introduced in to the Canadian diet”.&lt;ref&gt;Health Canada, ''Frequently Asked Questions – Biotechnology and Genetically Modified Foods'', online: Food and Nutrition &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''election''' was held in [[the Gambia]] on 8 August 1996. The new constitution was passed, with voter turnout of 86.9%.

==Background==
[[Gambian general election, 1992|Elected]] president [[Dawda Jawara]] was overthrown in a military coup led by [[Yahya Jammeh]] on 22 July 1994. Following the coup, Jammeh ruled Gambia by decree as head of the [[Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council]], with all political activity banned.&lt;ref name=FCO&gt;[http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1007029394365&amp;a=KCountryProfile&amp;aid=1019672596778 Country Profile: The Gambia] Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office&lt;/ref&gt; He promised a return to civilian rule within four years, and a constitution was drawn up following a controversial consultation process.&lt;ref name=FCO /&gt;

The new constitution allowed for multiparty elections, an unlimited number of five year presidential terms and lowered the voting age from 21 to 18.

The referendum was organised by the Provisional Independent Electoral Commission, with 441,732 voters registered.

In January 1997 [[Gambian parliamentary election, 1997|parliamentary elections]] were held and won by Jammeh's [[Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction]].

'''Harbottle &amp; Lewis''' is a [[law firm]] based in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]] which advises clients across the media, communications and entertainment industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=1868347|title=Harbottle &amp; Lewis LLP: Private Company Information - Businessweek|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harbottle &amp; Lewis has 42 partners and 68 lawyers and in 2016/17 recorded turnover of £28.1m.&lt;ref name=Byrne&gt;Matt Byrne, ''[[The Lawyer]]'', 16 August 2010, [http://www.thelawyer.com/harbottle-and-lewis/1005305.article Harbottle &amp; Lewis]&lt;/ref&gt; It is recommended by the independent legal directories The Legal 500 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legal500.com/firms/1467/offices/224 |title=Legal 500 |publisher=Legal 500 |date= |accessdate=2013-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chambers and Partners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chambersandpartners.com/UK/Firms/178-34245 |title=Chambers and Partners |publisher=Chambers and Partners |date= |accessdate=2013-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; in all its core practice areas.

== History ==
Laurence Harbottle and Brian Lewis met at Law School in [[Guildford]] in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chambersstudent.co.uk/Law/FirmFeature/178 |title='&amp;#39;Chambers Student Guide'&amp;#39; |publisher=Chambersstudent.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both lawyers had a special interest in the legal aspects of film production and theatre and in December 1955 established Harbottle &amp; Lewis with its office in South Molton Street, [[Mayfair]]. While Brian Lewis concentrated on film guarantees and film productions, Laurence Harbottle mainly acted for film producers as well as writers, actors and technicians.

With advances in technology, their firm grew and developed its television and music industry expertise. More recently Harbottle &amp; Lewis has also built specialist practice areas in [[electronic commerce]] and interactive entertainment.

The firm moved from South Molton Street to its current location on [[Hanover Square, London|Hanover Square]] in May 1988.

Laurence Harbottle served as solicitor to friends [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Dirk Bogarde]]. The firm's clients presently include [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]], and subsequently his sons [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|The Duke of Cambridge]] and [[Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex|The Duke of Sussex]].

==Relations with News International==
{{Main|News International phone hacking scandal#Harbottle and Lewis}}
In 2006 Harbottle &amp; Lewis acted on behalf of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] in engaging  with the Metropolitan Police's investigations with regards to the hacking of the phones of his sons, Princes William and Harry, in the [[News of the World royal phone hacking scandal]].&lt;ref name=DMail2015461&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2015461/Why-did-Princes-lawyers-hide-hacking-evidence-Firm-advises-Royals-entangled-row-cover-up.html#ixzz1SLlwJKun|title=Why did Prince William's lawyers hide hacking evidence? Firm that advises Royals entangled in row over 'cover up'|author=Glen Owen|work=Daily Mail|date=17 July 2011|accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That scandal subsequently led to the dismissal of ''[[News of the World]]'' reporter [[Clive Goodman]]. When Goodman [[News of the World royal phone hacking scandal#Unfair dismissal claim|sued for unfair dismissal]], Harbottle &amp; Lewis were hired by the ''News of the World's'' parent company, [[News International]].&lt;ref name=DMail2015461/&gt;

On 10 July 2011, Harbottle &amp; Lewis acting for their client [[News International]] were cited by ''[[BBC News]]'' Business editor [[Robert Peston]] as being involved in the 'smoking gun' emails in the ''[[News of the World]]'' [[News of the World phone hacking scandal|phone hacking scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Peston]], ''[[BBC]]'', 10 July 2011, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14099102 News International found "smoking gun" emails in 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawyerwatch.wordpress.com/2011/07/10/hackgate-where-were-the-lawyers/ |title=Hackgate: where were the lawyers? |publisher=Lawyerwatch.wordpress.com |date=2011-07-10 |accessdate=2013-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 July 2011, the firm issued an open letter outlining its position,&lt;ref name=LegalWeek2094792&gt;''[[Legal Week]]'', 18 July 2011, [http://www.legalweek.com/legal-week/news/2094792/harbottle-defends-hackgate-position-grabiner-tipped-lead-newscorp-clean Harbottle defends Hackgate position; Grabiner to lead News Corp clean-up]&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed Luther Pendragon to handle PR issues relating to the affair.&lt;ref name=LegalWeek2094792/&gt; On 19 July, Lord MacDonald the former Director of Public Prosecutions engaged by News Corporation to review the emails handed to Harbottle &amp; Lewis in 2007, said in evidence to the [[Home Affairs Select Committee]]:&lt;ref&gt;BBC, 20 July 2011, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14197962 Ex-Met Police chief denies 'swipe' at prime minister]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|I have to tell you that the material I saw was so blindingly obvious that anyone trying to argue that it shouldn't be given to the police would have had a very tough task}}

On 20 July, Harbottle &amp; Lewis issued a statement saying that it had asked News International to release it from its professional duty of confidentiality, which had been declined by News International. Harbottle &amp; Lewis subsequently wrote to [[John Whittingdale]] MP, chairman of the [[Culture, Media and Sport Committee]], asking to provide evidence to the committee.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Byrne, ''[[The Lawyer]]'', 20 July 2011, [http://www.thelawyer.com/harbottle-forbidden-from-responding-to-news-internationals-put-down/1008692.article Harbottle forbidden from responding to News International's put-down]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July it was reported that News International had authorised Harbottle &amp; Lewis to answer questions from the Metropolitan Police Service and parliamentary select committees in respect of what they were asked to do.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Independent]]'', 21 July 2011, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/law-firm-given-right-of-reply-over-failure-to-expose-bribery-2317840.html Law firm given right of reply over 'failure' to expose bribery]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Culture, Media and Sports Committee is reported to be planning to write to Harbottle &amp; Lewis asking its representatives to appear when it resumes in October.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', 21 July 2011, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/21/phone-hacking-harbottle-lewis-rupert-murdoch-select-committee Phone hacking: legal firm accused by Murdochs called before committee]&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Farrelly, one of the MPs on the committee, said:
{{cquote|Harbottle &amp; Lewis stand right up there with all the other people who have come to us and maintained there was only one rogue reporter.....

That letter has been allowed to lie on the record for four years when Harbottle &amp; Lewis had other evidence from emails of wrongdoing that have now been finally provided to the police, so Harbottle &amp; Lewis have a lot of questions to answer and we will be pursuing them. We don't know what Harbottle &amp; Lewis were asked to review, we don't know what their brief was.}}

He said that a letter written by the London law firm in 2007 to News International concerning a review of internal News of the World emails was now "clearly misleading".

On 22 July, Tom Watson, another MP on the Committee, published a letter &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tom-watson.co.uk/2011/07/response-from-solicitors-regulation-authority-harbottle-lewis |title=Response from Solicitors Regulation Authority – Harbottle &amp; Lewis &amp;#124; Tom Watson MP |publisher=Tom-watson.co.uk |date=2011-07-22 |accessdate=2013-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808150051/http://www.tom-watson.co.uk/2011/07/response-from-solicitors-regulation-authority-harbottle-lewis/ |archivedate=8 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Solicitors Regulation Authority]] in response to his letter expressing concerns about Harbottle and Lewis's part in the phone-hacking affair.  In the letter, Anthony Townsend, Chief Executive of the SRA said:

{{cquote|On the basis of our preliminary review of the public domain material, we have decided to instigate a formal investigation.

We will pursue our investigation vigorously and thoroughly, but emphasise that our inquiries are at an early stage, and that no conclusions have been reached about whether there may have been any impropriety by any solicitor}}

'''Hires Root Beer''' is a [[root beer]] marketed by [[Keurig Dr Pepper]].  Introduced in 1876, it is considered the second longest continuously made [[soft drink]] in the United States.  Only [[Vernors]]  [[ginger ale]], dating to 1866, is older.

== History ==
[[File:All gone Could I have another glass of that Hires' Rootbeer.jpg|thumbnail|right|19th Century American Trade Card for Hires Root Beer, 1894.]]
Hires Root Beer was created by [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] [[pharmacist]] [[Charles Elmer Hires]]. The official story  is that Hires first tasted [[root beer]], a traditional American beverage dating back to the colonial era, while on his honeymoon in 1875.&lt;ref name=brands&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.drpeppersnapplegroup.com/brands/hires/| title=Our Brands| publisher=Keurig Dr Pepper| accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, historical accounts vary and the actual time and place of the discovery may never be known.&lt;ref name=bennett&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gourmetrootbeer.com/history.html#hires| title=Local Historians Argue Over the Root of Hires| first=Eileen| last=Bennett| date=June 28, 1998| work=[[The Press of Atlantic City]]| accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1876, Hires had developed his own recipe and was marketing 25-cent packets of powder which each yielded five gallons of root beer. At Philadelphia's [[Centennial Exposition]] in 1876, he cultivated new customers by giving away free glasses of root beer. Hires marketed it as a solid concentrate of sixteen wild roots and berries. It claimed to purify the blood and make rosy cheeks.&lt;ref name=pendergrast&gt;{{cite book| authorlink=Mark Pendergrast| first=Mark| last=Pendergrast| year=2000| title=For God, Country and Coca-Cola| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bSAChoqpnHUC&amp;q=hires#v=onepage&amp;q=hires&amp;f=false| page=14| publisher=Basic Books| isbn=978-0-46505-468-8| accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, he began producing a liquid extract and a syrup for use in [[soda fountain]]s, and was soon shipping root beer in kegs and producing a special fountain dispenser called the "Hires Automatic Munimaker." In 1890, the Charles E. Hires Company incorporated and began supplying Hires root beer in small bottles&lt;ref name=funderburg&gt;{{cite book |title=Sundae best: a history of soda fountains |first=Anne Cooper | last=Funderburg |publisher=Bowling Green University Popular Press |location=[[Bowling Green, Ohio]] |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-87972-854-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wr_yPYvkNWwC&amp;pg=PA92| pages=92–94| accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hoolihan&gt;{{cite book |title=Social Medicine in the United States, 1717-1917| first=Christopher |last=Hoolihan |publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer |year=2001 |isbn=978-1-58046-098-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFKvimYMHloC&amp;pg=PA454 |page=454 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming over a million bottles sold by 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hires Root Beer|url=http://lcdl.library.cofc.edu/lcdl/catalog/lcdl:60538|website=Lowcountry Digital Library|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Hires's choice of name for his product caused a problem: the word "beer" drew the wrath of the [[temperance movement]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. He had his root beer tested by a laboratory, and trumpeted their conclusion that a glass of his root beer contained less alcohol than a loaf of bread.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
Hires Root Beer was promoted as "The Temperance Drink" and "the Greatest Health-Giving Beverage in the World."  Hires advertised aggressively, believing "doing business without advertising is like winking at a girl in the dark. '''''You''''' know what you are doing, but nobody '''''ELSE''''' does."&lt;ref name=brands/&gt;

[[File:SitH - Hires Root Beer mug.jpg|thumb|left|Hires Root Beer mug, 1930s or earlier]]
One of the major ingredients of root beer was [[sassafras]] oil, a plant root extract used in beverages for its flavor and presumed medicinal properties. The medicinal properties of root beer are emphasized in the advertising slogan, "Join Health and Cheer; Drink Hires Rootbeer." The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] banned sassafras oil in 1960 because it contains the carcinogen and liver-damaging chemical [[safrol]]. However, a process was later discovered by which the harmful chemical could be removed from sassafras oil while preserving the flavor.&lt;ref name=nickell&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nickell |first=Joe |date=January–February 2011 |title='Pop' Culture: Patent Medicines Become Soft Drinks |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=14–17 |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/pop_culture_patent_medicines_become_soda_drinks |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the move to "natural and artificial flavors", Hires  ingredients included carbonated water, sugar, dextrose, caramel, plant extractives of birch, sassafras, licorice, vanilla, spikenard, sarsaparilla, hops, wintergreen, pipsissewa, ginger and flavor.

Hires Root Beer kits, available in the [[United States]] and Canada from the early 1900s through the 1980s allowed consumers to mix an extract with water, sugar and yeast to brew their own root beer. However, most consumption was of pre-bottled root beer.

A mid-1960s' advertising campaign featured jingles by jazz singer [[Blossom Dearie]], wherein she sang in a Betty-Boop voice: "Hires Root Beer!  Hires Rootin' Tootin' Root Beer!  Hires Rootin'-Tootin' Rabble-Rousin', lion-roarin', Roman-candle-lightin' Root Beer!"

[[Sara Lee Corporation|Consolidated Foods]] bought the company from the Hires family in 1960, only to sell Hires two years later to [[Crush (beverage)|Crush International]]. [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] bought Crush in 1980, and sold it to [[Cadbury|Cadbury Schweppes]] in 1989. Cadbury divested its soft drinks arm in 2008, and the beverage company renamed itself Keurig Dr Pepper that year.

In Canada, the Hires brand is no longer sold by Keurig Dr Pepper; retailers and vending machines have replaced it with [[Pepsi]]-owned [[Mug Root Beer]] since the 1990s and DPSG markets Stewarts Root Beer in Canada. The Hires brand is now offered by [[Canada Dry Motts]] as an alcoholic drink, Hires Root Beer and Vodka.&lt;ref name=rv&gt;{{cite web| title=Hires Root Beer and Vodka| url=http://www.canadadrymotts.ca/brands/Hires| publisher=Canada Dry Motts| date=27 November 2018| accessdate=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hires availability in the U.S. is limited as other Dr. Pepper owned brands like [[A&amp;W Root Beer]] are competing for the same bottlers on behalf of the same company.&lt;ref name=bp&gt;{{cite web| title=Killing A Product – The Demise of Hires Root Beer| url=http://stuffnobodycaresabout.com/2011/08/22/killing-a-product-why-you-cant-find-hires-root-beer/| publisher=Stuff Nobody Cares About| date=22 August 2011| accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The uniform worn by Queensland police officers after separation in 1859 was a dark blue jacket and top with a forage cap, supplied by the [[New South Wales Police Force|New South Wales police]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Transport in the settled areas was mainly by foot and in the unsettled areas by horse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''The Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal ) (IMDT) Act''' was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of India]] enacted in 1983 by the [[Indira Gandhi]] government. It was struck down by the [[Supreme Court of India]] in 2005 in ''Sarbananda Sonowal v. Union of India''.

Known as the IMDT Act (1983) it described the procedures to detect illegal immigrants (from [[Bangladesh]]) and expel them from [[Assam]]. The Act was pushed through mainly on the grounds that it provided special protections against undue harassment to the “minorities” affected by the [[Assam Agitation]]. It was applicable to the state of Assam only whereas in other states, detection of foreigners is done under [[The Foreigners Act, 1946]].

The act made it difficult to deport illegal immigrants from Assam. It has been alleged to be one of the main reasons for the rapid rise of the Muslim population and demographic change in Assam.

==Salient features==
The Foreigners Act, 1946 defines a foreigner as a person who is not a citizen of India. Section 9 of the Act states that, where the nationality of a person is not evident as per preceding section 8, the onus of proving whether a person is a foreigner or not, shall lie upon such person.

However, under the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal ) (IMDT) Act, the burden of proving the citizenship or otherwise rested on the accuser and the police, not the accused. This was a major departure from the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946.

The accuser must reside within a 3&amp;nbsp;km radius of the accused, fill out a complaint form (a maximum of ten per accuser is allowed) and pay a fee of ten Rupees.

If a suspected illegal migrant is thus successfully accused, he is required by the Act to simply produce a ration card to prove his Indian citizenship.

And if a case made it past these requirements, a system of tribunals made up of retired judges would finally decide on deportation based on the facts.

The act also provided that 'if the application is found frivolous or vexatious' the Central Government may not accept it.

It excluded the migrants who entered India before March 25, 1971 from the illegal-migration accusation. And for post-1971 migrants too, the procedure for deporting were tough.

==Supreme Court's views==
The Act was challenged by [[Sarbananda Sonowal]] in courts. In 2005 a three-judge Bench of the [[Supreme Court of India]] held that the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act, 1983 and rules "has created the biggest hurdle and is the main impediment or barrier in the identification and deportation of illegal migrants" and struck down the Act.&lt;ref&gt;http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1436100/&lt;/ref&gt;

The court also observed "(the conviction rate under the IMDT act) comes to less than half per cent of the cases initiated...(the IMDT Act) is coming to the advantage of such illegal migrants as any proceedings initiated against them almost entirely ends in their favour, enables them to have a document having official sanctity to the effect that they are not illegal migrants."

On 9 August 2012, the Supreme Court hearing a [[Public interest litigation in India|public interest litigation]] petition  seeking a direction for deportation of illegal migrants, was told that the Government of India, as a matter of policy, "does not support any kind of illegal migration either into its territory or illegal immigration of its citizens. "It was also stated that the Government is committed to deporting illegal Bangladeshi migrants, but only lawfully. It asserted that the demand for deleting the names of alleged 41 lakh doubtful voters from the list of 2006 on the basis of religious and linguistic profiling would prima facie be illegal, arbitrary and violative of the secular and democratic credentials of India. The court  posted the matter for final hearing on 6 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3747019.ece |title= Committed to deporting illegal migrants, but only lawfully: Centre|date=10-08-2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2660">'''The Japan–Korea Treaty of 1882''', also known as the '''Treaty of Chemulpo''' or the ''Chemulpo Convention,''   was negotiated between [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] and [[Joseon|Korea]] following the [[Imo Incident]] in July 1882.&lt;ref name="takenobu131"&gt;Takenobu, Yoshitaro. (1887). {{Google books|CJFKAAAAMAAJ|''The Japan Yearbook,'' p. 131.|page=131}}; excerpt, "''Korea agreed in the ''so-called Chemulpo Convention'' to pay [Japan] an indemnity and to build at her own cost barracks for the [Japanese] Legation guards''."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On July 23, 1882, factional strife between Koreans in Korea's capital expanded beyond the initial causes of the disturbance.&lt;ref name="takenobu131"/&gt;

[[File:ImoIncident ToyoharaChikanobu (2).jpg|thumb|right|"The Korean Uprising of 1882" &amp;mdash; woodblock print by Toyohara Chikanobu, 1882]]
As the violence unfolded, the Japanese legation was destroyed by rioters.  The Japanese diplomats were forced to flee the country.  When order was restored, the Japanese government demanded damages and other concessions form the Korean government.&lt;ref name="takenobu131"/&gt;

The negotiations were concluded in August 1882.

Article V of the "convention" permitted the Japanese to protect the Japanese legation and the Japanese community in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Duus, Peter. (1995). {{Google books|DZaizVa8oAAC|''The Abacus and the Sword: The Japanese Penetration of Korea, 1895–1910''|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, the Japanese forgave the ¥400,000 indemnity which had been mandated by the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Duus, {{Google books|DZaizVa8oAAC| p. 57.|page=57}}; Takenobu, p. 131; excerpt, "''Japan remitted the major portion of the indemnity on the understanding that it should be used for the purpose of internal reforms''."&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Karachi Agreement''' of 1949 was signed by the military representatives of India and Pakistan, supervised by the [[United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan]], establishing a cease-fire line in [[Kashmir]] following the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]].{{sfn|Wirsing, War or Peace on the Line of Control?|1998|p=9}} It established a cease-fire line which has been monitored by United Nations observers from the United Nations since then.{{sfn|Hilaire, United Nations Law and the Security Council|2005|pp=29-30}}

==Background==
{{Main|United Nations Security Council Resolution 47}}

The Security Council Resolution 47 of April 1948 established a UN Commission ([[United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan]] — UNCIP) to mediate between India and Pakistan in order to bring about a cessation of [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|fighting]] in Kashmir and to make arrangements for a popular plebiscite. After negotiations with the two sides, the Commission passed a three-part resolution in August 1948 and subsequently added a 'supplement'. The three parts dealt with ceasefire, terms for truce, and procedures for negotiation regarding the plebiscite. Both the countries accepted the resolution and a ceasefire was achieved on 31 December 1948.

==Agreement==
[[File:Kashmir Jammu Map.png|thumb|right|The princely state of Jammu and Kashmir with the current [[Line of Control]] defined in 1972 (similar to that of 1949)]]
The Karachi Agreement, formally called the ''Agreement Between Military Representatives of India and Pakistan Regarding the Establishment of a Cease-Fire Line in the State of Jammu and Kashmir,'' was signed on 27 July 1949, supervised by the Truce Subcommittee of the UNCIP.{{sfn|Wirsing, War or Peace on the Line of Control?|1998|p=9}}

The signatories were:
# Lt. Gen. [[S. M. Shrinagesh]], on behalf of India
# Maj. Gen. [[W. J. Cawthorn]], on behalf of Pakistan
# Hernando Samper and M. Delvoie, on behalf of the UNCIP.

The other members of the Indian delegation were Maj. Gen. [[K. S. Thimayya]], Brig. [[Sam Maneckshaw]], Maj. [[Srinivas Kumar Sinha|S. K. Sinha]] (who acted as the ''aide-de-camp'' for Gen. Srinagesh), and the secretaries of the Defence Ministry and the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs. The Pakistani delegation included Maj. Gen. Nazir Ahmed and Brig. Sher Khan and civil servants M. Ayub and A. A. Khan. The military representatives of the two sides negotiated for a week starting 18 July to demarcate the positions under their control.{{sfn|Bhattacharya, What Price Freedom|2013|pp=151–152}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Ganguly |first=Sumit |title=Deadly Impasse |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_-lCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134 |date=31 March 2016 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-76361-5 |pages=134–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S. K. Sinha stated that the Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] briefed the Indian delegation before the Karachi meeting, wherein he informed them that the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 47|UN Resolution]] conceded the legality of Kashmir's accession to India and, so, any "no man's land" would belong to India. The Pakistani delegation would need to produce proof to the UN Commission of factual positions of their control for all the territory they claim. Sinha stated that, based on this principle, the agreement demarcated several hundred square miles of territory on the Indian side even though there were no Indian troops in that territory.&lt;ref name=Arpi&gt;Claude Arpi, [http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-the-myths-of-wild-roses-and-pakistani-presence-in-siachen-1694621 The myths of wild roses and Pakistani presence in Siachen], Daily News and Analysis, 28 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Page 2 - CFL as shown on UN Map to Karachi Agreement 1949.JPG|thumb|right|The ceasefire line of 1949]]

The 830 kilometre long ceasefire line established in the agreement started from a southernmost point just west of the [[Chenab river]] in [[Jammu Division|Jammu]]. It ran in a rough arc northwards and then northeastwards to the map coordinate [[NJ9842]], about 19&amp;nbsp;km north of the [[Shyok river]].{{sfn|Wirsing, War or Peace on the Line of Control?|1998|pp=9-10}}

From the map point NJ9842 it was said to run due north to the international boundary with China, at a distance of about 60–65&amp;nbsp;km. Since there were no troops in that area of inaccessible glacial terrain, no effort was made to extend the ceasefire line between NJ9842 and the China border. This area, of the [[Siachen Glacier]], eventually became a bone of contention between India and Pakistan.{{sfn|Wirsing, War or Peace on the Line of Control?|1998|p=10}}

Another anomaly arose at the southern end of the ceasefire line in [[Jammu Division|Jammu]]. From the terminus of the ceasefire line to the international boundary between Indian and Pakistani [[Punjab]], there was a gap of over 200&amp;nbsp;km, which was covered by a recognised "provincial boundary" between Pakistani Punjab and the [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|princely state of Jammu and Kashmir]]. India generally referred to this boundary as the "international border", whereas Pakistan referred to it as the "border" or the "working border".{{sfn|Wirsing, War or Peace on the Line of Control?|1998|p=10}}

The Karachi Agreement between India and Pakistan established a cease-fire line to be supervised by the military observers. These observers, under the command of the [[Military Advisor]], formed the nucleus of the [[United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan]] (UNMOGIP). On 30 March 1951, following the termination of the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP), the Security Council, by Resolution 91 (1951) decided that UNMOGIP should continue to supervise the cease-fire line in Kashmir. UNMOGIP's functions were to observe and report, investigate complaints of cease-fire violations and submit its findings to each party and to the Secretary General.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/time-un-observers-left-kashmir-india/article4330381.ece Time U.N. observers left Kashmir: India]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19006">'''[[Land value tax]]ation (i.e. property tax applied only to the unimproved value of land) has a long history in the [[United States]]''' dating back from [[Physiocrat]] influence on [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]].  It is most famously associated with [[Henry George]] and his book ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'' (1879), which argued that because the supply of land is fixed and its location value is created by communities and public works, the [[economic rent]] of land is the most logical source of public revenue.&lt;ref name="George 1879"&gt;{{cite book |title=Progress and Poverty |last=George |first=Henry |coauthors=  |year=1879 |publisher = |location=  |isbn= |pages= | url= http://www.henrygeorge.org/pchp19.htm}} The often cited passage is titled "The unbound Savannah."&lt;/ref&gt; and which had considerable impact on turn-of-the-century reform movements in America and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Charles Albro ''Henry George''. Oxford University Press 1955 and Greenwood Press 1974. {{ISBN|0-8371-7775-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Every single state in the United States has some form of property tax on real estate and hence, in part, a tax on land value. However, [[Pennsylvania]] in particular has seen local attempts to rely more heavily on the taxation of land value.

== History ==
[[Image:Henry George.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Henry George]] in 1865.]]

[[Physiocrat]] influence in the [[United States]] came by [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]] as  Ambassadors to France,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/gaffney-mason_notes-on-the-physiocrats-1998.html |title=Notes on the Physiocrats|first=Mason|last=Gaffney|year=1998|publisher=School of Cooperative Individualism|author-link=Mason Gaffney|accessdate=2008-11-07|postscript=.}}&lt;!--|oldurl=http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/gaffney_physiocrats.html--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Jefferson brought his friend [[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours|Pierre du Pont]] to the [[United States]] to promote the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jefferson |first=Thomas |url=http://worldcat.org/wcpa/ow/4d6e2d7af981afc5.html |title=Jefferson correspondence with Du Pont de Nemours |accessdate=2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statement in the [[Federalist No. 36|36th Federalist Paper]] reflects that  influence, "A small land tax will answer the purpose of the States, and will be their most simple and most fit resource."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/home/histdox/fed_36.html |title=Federalist Paper #36 |accessdate=2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Henry George ===

[[Henry George]] (September 2, 1839 &amp;ndash; October 29, 1897) was perhaps the most famous advocate of land rents. An [[United States|American]] [[political economist]], he advocated a "[[Single Tax]]" on [[land (economics)|land]] that would eliminate the need for all other taxes. In 1879 he authored ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'', which significantly influenced land taxation in the United States.

== Legality ==

There are two potential legal obstacles unique to land value taxation in the United States: uniformity clauses and [[Dillon's Rule]].  At the federal level, land value taxation is legal so long as it is apportioned among the states.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Const., art. I, § 2, cl. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hylton&gt;[[Hylton v. United States]], [[Case citation|3 U.S. 171]](1796)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uniformity clauses===
The United States legal system includes "uniformity clauses" found in individual State Constitutions as well as the federal Constitution.  Broadly speaking, these clauses require taxation to be applied evenly or uniformly within a jurisdiction. However, the exact wording and meaning of these clauses differs from constitution to constitution. Although the federal [[Uniformity Clause]] has never been an issue, the wording and interpretation of many [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] has created issues peculiar to each state. For example in 1898, the [[Maryland Court of Appeals]] (the highest state appellate court) ruled that the use of land value taxation in Hyattsville was unconstitutional. Shortly thereafter, an amendment to the [[Maryland]] Declaration of Rights specifically allowed for land value taxation where authorized by the State Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/43const/html/00dec.html |title= Maryland Declaration of Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="80attygen"&gt;80 Atty Gen Op 316 (1995) http://www.oag.state.md.us/Opinions/1995/80OAG316.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the uniformity clause in [[Pennsylvania]] has been broadly construed, and land value taxation has been used since 1913.

Each state will have its own legal stance or lack of any stance on LVT; some uniformity clauses explicitly allow some types of classifications of property, some have no uniformity clause, and some do not specifically discuss land ''qua'' land at all. Except for the pre-1900 Maryland case of Hyattsville (later overturned by state constitutional amendment and statutory provisions), no [[State court (United States)|state courts]] have actually struck down an attempt to implement land value taxation on the basis of a state uniformity clause.  Nor have any courts even squarely ruled that land and improvements are actually "classes" of property such that uniformity clauses are applicable. Consequently, as a general rule, as long as each type of property (land, improvements, personal) is taxed uniformly there is no constitutional obstacle.

Even in rather strict uniformity clause states, it is unclear whether the uniformity clause actually prohibits separate land value taxation. Some states have other constitutional provisions - for example in New Jersey, which gives localities maximum [[home rule]] authority,&lt;ref&gt;''The provisions of this Constitution and of any law concerning municipal corporations formed for local government, or concerning counties, shall be liberally construed in their favor. The powers of counties and such municipal corporations shall include not only those granted in express terms but also those of necessary or fair implication, or incident to the powers expressly conferred, or essential thereto, and not inconsistent with or prohibited by this Constitution or by law.'' [http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/lawsconstitution/constitution.asp Constitution of the State of New Jersey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630013226/http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/lawsconstitution/constitution.asp |date=2009-06-30 }}, Article IV, Section VII (11).&lt;/ref&gt; and have not adopted Dillon's Rule. While the uniformity clauses might be interpreted to prohibit state-wide action, local action may be legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Jersey Constitution, Article IV, Section VII (11) |url=http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/lawsconstitution/constitution.asp |accessdate=2009-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630013226/http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/lawsconstitution/constitution.asp |archivedate=2009-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local authorization: Dillon's Rule v. Cooley Doctrine===
Although uniformity clauses do not seem to be a major obstacle in most jurisdictions to land value taxation, control of local authority by the state [[legislature]] remains a real obstacle, requiring the need for local enabling authority or the abrogation of [[Dillon's Rule]]. The theory of state preeminence over local governments was expressed as Dillon's Rule in an 1868 case, where it was stated that "[m]unicipal corporations owe their origin to, and derive their powers and rights wholly from, the legislature. It breathes into them the breath of life, without which they cannot exist. As it creates, so may it destroy. If it may destroy, it may abridge and control."&lt;ref&gt;''Clinton v Cedar Rapids and the Missouri River Railroad'',(24 Iowa 455; 1868).&lt;/ref&gt;

As opposed to Dillon's Rule, the [[Cooley Doctrine]] expressed the theory of an inherent right to local self determination. In a concurring opinion, Michigan Supreme Court Judge [[Thomas M. Cooley|Thomas Cooley]] in 1871 stated: "[L]ocal government is a matter of absolute right; and the state cannot take it away."&lt;ref&gt;''People v Hurlbut'', (24 Mich 44, 95; 1871).&lt;/ref&gt; In Maryland, for example, [[municipal corporations]] have the right to implement land value taxation, but the counties, including Baltimore City which is treated as a county in Maryland for certain purposes, do not.&lt;ref name="80attygen"/&gt;  However, [[Dillon's Rule]] has been abandoned in some states, whether in whole by state constitution or state legislation or piecemeal by home rule legislation passed by the State Legislature.  For example, the Virginia Legislature has granted land value tax authority to Fairfax and Roanoke.

== Usage ==

Every single state in the [[United States]] has some form of property tax on real estate and hence, in part, a tax on land value. There are several cities that use LVT to varying degrees, but LVT in its purest form is not used on state or national levels. Land value taxation was tried in the [[Southern United States|South]] during [[Reconstruction era of the United States#Taxation during Reconstruction|Reconstruction]] as a way to promote [[land reform]]. There have also been several attempts throughout history to introduce land value taxation on a national level. In ''[[Hylton v. United States]]'', the Supreme Court directly acknowledged that a Land Tax was constitutional, so long as it was apportioned equally among the states. Two of the [[associate justice]]s explained in their summaries, stating:

{{quote|[T]he Constitution declares, ... both in theory and practice, a tax on land is deemed to be a direct tax. ... I never entertained a doubt, that the principal, I will not say, the only, objects, that the framers of the Constitution contemplated as falling within the rule of apportionment, were a [[capitation tax]] and a tax on land.&lt;ref name=hylton/&gt;|[[William Paterson (judge)|Justice William Paterson]]}}

{{quote|I am inclined to think, but of this I do not give a judicial opinion, that the direct taxes contemplated by the Constitution, are only two, to wit, a capitation, or poll tax, simply, without regard to property, profession, or any other circumstance; and a tax on land.&lt;ref name=hylton/&gt;|[[Samuel Chase|Justice Samuel Chase]]}}

There have also been attempts since then to introduce land value tax legislation, such as the Federal Property Tax Act of 1798,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drbilllong.com/LegalHistoryII/TaxII.html |title=The Federal Property Tax Act of 1798 |accessdate=2009-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402041220/http://www.drbilllong.com/LegalHistoryII/TaxII.html |archivedate=2009-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and HR 6026, a bill introduced to the [[United States House of Representatives]] on February 20, 1935 by [[Theodore L. Moritz]] of Pennsylvania. HR 6026 would have imposed a national 1% tax on the value of land in excess of $3,000.

===Single tax===

The first city in the United States to enact land value taxation was [[Hyattsville, Maryland]] in 1898, through the efforts of Judge Jackson H. Ralston.  The Maryland Courts subsequently found it to be barred by the [[Maryland Constitution]]. Judge Ralston and his supporters commenced a campaign to amend the state Constitution which culminated in the Art. 15 of the [[Maryland Constitution#Declaration of Rights|Declaration of Rights]] (which remains today part of the Maryland State Constitution). In addition, he helped see that enabling legislation for towns be passed in 1916, which also remains in effect today.&lt;ref name="80attygen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/georgists_ralston_jackson.html |title=School of Cooperative Individualism / Jackson H. Ralston |publisher=Cooperativeindividualism.org |accessdate=2009-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705030919/http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/georgists_ralston_jackson.html |archivedate=July 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The towns of [[Fairhope, Alabama]] and [[Arden, Delaware]] were later founded as model Georgist communities or "single tax colonies".

In 2011, [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]] fully shifted its property tax so that it fell only on land&lt;ref name="Altoona"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbantoolsconsult.org/blog/2011/12/15/Altoona-PA-City-tax-wholly-on-land-values-normality.aspx |title=Altoona, PA: City tax wholly on land values {{=}} normality}}&lt;/ref&gt; but reverted to a tax on land and improvements in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/the-short-life-of-pennsylvanias-radical-tax-reform/article/2614398|title=The short life of Pennsylvania's radical tax reform|newspaper=Washington Examiner|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Split-rate taxation===

[[Image:Market Square in Harrisburg.jpg|thumb|250px|Market Square in [[Downtown Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]].]]
Nearly 20 Pennsylvania cities employ a ''two-rate'' or ''split-rate'' property tax: taxing the value of land at a higher rate and the value of the buildings and improvements at a lower one.  This can be seen as a compromise between pure LVT and an ordinary property tax falling on real estate (land value plus improvement value).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lincolninst.edu/pubs/dl/1275_Hughes%20Final.pdf |author=Mark Alan Hughes |title=Why So Little Georgism in America: Using the Pennsylvania Case Files to Understand the Slow, Uneven Progress of Land Value Taxation |publisher=[[Lincoln Institute of Land Policy]] |date=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823024415/https://www.lincolninst.edu/pubs/dl/1275_Hughes%20Final.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, two-rate taxation may be seen as a form that allows gradual transformation of the traditional real estate property tax into a pure land value tax.

Nearly two dozen local Pennsylvania jurisdictions (such as [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcommonwealth.org/news/lvt-jurisdiction-rates |title=PA two-rate cities and rates as of Nov. 2009 |publisher=The Henry George Foundation of America |accessdate=2010-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419232223/http://www.ourcommonwealth.org/news/lvt-jurisdiction-rates |archivedate=April 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; use two-rate property taxation in which the tax on land value is higher and the tax on improvement value is lower. [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] used the two-rate system from 1913 to 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progress.org/cg/feet3.htm |title=Some States Already Have Two-Rate Site Value Tax Enabling Laws |publisher=The Progress Report |accessdate=2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; when a countywide property reassessment led to a drastic increase in assessed land values during 2001 after years of underassessment, and the system was abandoned in favor of the traditional single-rate property tax. The tax on land in Pittsburgh was about 5.77 times the tax on improvements.

Notwithstanding the change in 2001, the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership [[Business improvement district|Business Improvement District]] employed a pure land value taxation as a surcharge on the regular property tax from 1997 to 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://downtownpittsburgh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2016-BID-Summary-for-Website.pdf|title=Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership BID Assessment and Calculation|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, [[Florenz Plassmann]] and [[Nicolaus Tideman]] wrote&lt;ref name="markovchain"&gt;"A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Analysis of the Effect of Two-Rate Property Taxes on Construction", Journal of Urban Economics, 2000, vol. 47, issue 2, p. 216-247&lt;/ref&gt; that when comparing [[Pennsylvania]] cities using a higher tax rate on land value and a lower rate on improvements with similar sized Pennsylvania cities using the same rate on land and improvements, the higher land value taxation leads to increased construction within the jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, W. &amp;  Schwab, R.

There are different claims of '''wars extended by diplomatic irregularity''' which involve long peaceful periods after the end of hostilities where, for various reasons, the belligerents could be considered to be in a technical state of war.

Some have occurred when small countries were named in a [[declaration of war]] being accidentally omitted from a [[peace treaty]] concerning the wider conflict. These "extended wars" have only been discovered after the fact, and have no impact during the long period (often hundreds of years) after the actual fighting ended. The discovery of an "extended war" is sometimes an opportunity for a friendly ceremonial peace to be contracted by the belligerent parties. Such ceremonial peace ceremonies are even conducted after ancient wars where no peace treaty was expected in the first place, and in cases where the countries weren't even at war at all, such as the case of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed#Relations_with_Russia|Berwick v Russia]]. These "treaties" often involve non-sovereign sub-national entities, such as cities, who do not in reality have the power to declare or end wars.

Such a situation is to be distinguished from that of parties deliberately avoiding a peace treaty when political disputes outlive military conflict, as in the [[Kuril Islands dispute]] between [[Japan]] and [[Russia]], and also from situations where a peace treaty is not signed because the original declaration of war was deemed to be illegal, such as the declaration of war by [[Thailand]] against the [[United States]] was mutually recognized to be after [[World War II]].

Not all such cases are without consequence. For example the lack of a formal peace treaty with a government representing all of Germany (due to its [[History_of_Germany_(1945–90)|partition]]) was the legal justification for the continued presence of U.S. troops in Western Germany.

'''LonWorks''' (local operating network) is a networking platform specifically created to address the needs of control applications. The platform is built on a protocol created by [[Echelon Corporation]] for networking devices over media such as [[twisted pair]], [[Power line communication|powerlines]], [[fiber optics]], and [[radio frequency|RF]]. It is used for the automation of various functions within buildings such as [[lighting]] and [[HVAC]]; see [[building automation]].

== Origins and uptake ==

The technology has its origins with chip designs, power line and twisted pair, signaling technology, routers, network management software, and other products from [[Echelon Corporation]].  In 1999 the communications protocol (then known as [[LonTalk]]) was submitted to [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] and accepted as a standard for control networking ('''ANSI/CEA-709.1-B''').  Echelon's power line and twisted pair signaling technology was also submitted to ANSI for standardization and accepted. Since then, ANSI/CEA-709.1 has been accepted as the basis for [[IEEE 1473-L]] (in-train controls), [[Association of American Railroads|AAR]] electro-pneumatic braking systems for freight trains, [[International Forecourt Standards Forum|IFSF]] (European petrol station control), [[Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International|SEMI]] (semiconductor equipment manufacturing), and in 2005 as [[EN 14908]] (European building automation standard).  The protocol is also one of several data link/physical layers of the [[BACnet]] [[American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers|ASHRAE]]/ANSI standard for [[building automation]].

China ratified the technology as a national controls standard, GB/Z 20177.1-2006 and as a building and intelligent community standard, GB/T 20299.4-2006; and in 2007 CECED, the [[European Committee of Domestic Equipment Manufacturers]], adopted the protocol as part of its Household Appliances Control and Monitoring – Application Interworking Specification (AIS) standards.

During 2008 [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] and [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] have granted the communications protocol, twisted pair signaling technology, power line signaling technology, and Internet Protocol (IP) compatibility standard numbers ISO/IEC 14908-1, -2, -3, and -4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=2008-12-03 |title=LonWorks Technology Achieves ISO/IEC Standardization |url=http://www.lonmark.org/news_events/press/2008/1208_iso_standard |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==

By 2010 approximately 90 million devices were installed with LonWorks technology.  Manufacturers in a variety of industries including building, home, street lighting, transportation, utility, and industrial automation have adopted the platform as the basis for their product and service offerings.  Statistics as to the number of locations using the LonWorks technology are scarce, but products and applications built on top of the platform include such diverse functions as embedded machine control, municipal and highway/tunnel/street lighting, heating and air conditioning systems, intelligent electricity metering, subway train control, building lighting, stadium lighting and speaker control, security systems, fire detection and suppression, and newborn location monitoring and alarming, as well as remote power generation load control.

== Technical details ==
Two physical-layer signaling technologies, [[twisted pair]] "free topology" and power line carrier, are typically included in each of the standards created around the LonWorks technology.  The two-wire layer operates at 78 kbit/s using [[differential Manchester encoding]], while the power line achieves either 5.4 or 3.6 kbit/s, depending on frequency.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.echelon.com/support/documentation/manuals/transceivers/005-0154-01D.pdf PL3120/3150 transceiver data book, p5&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the LonWorks platform uses an affiliated [[Internet protocol]] (IP) tunneling standard—ISO/IEC 14908-4&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50360 IP Tunneling Protocol (International)&lt;/ref&gt; (ANSI/CEA-852)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.ihs.com/doc_detail.cfm?document_name=CTA-852.1 |title=CTA-852.1 : Enhanced Protocol for Tunneling Component Network Protocols over Internet Protocol Channels}}&lt;/ref&gt; -- in use by a number of manufacturers&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lonmark.org/membership/directory/ Directory of LonMark International Member Companies&lt;/ref&gt; to connect the devices on previously deployed and new LonWorks platform-based networks to IP-aware applications or remote network-management tools.  Many LonWorks platform-based control applications are being implemented with some sort of IP integration, either at the UI/application level or in the controls infrastructure.  This is accomplished with Web services or IP-routing products available in the market.

An Echelon Corporation-designed [[integrated circuit|IC]] consisting of several 8-bit processors, the "Neuron chip" was initially the only way to implement a LonTalk protocol node and is used in the large majority of LonWorks platform-based hardware. Since 1999, the protocol has been available for general-purpose processors: A port of the ANSI/CEA-709.1 standard to IP-based or 32-bit chips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.ihs.com/doc_detail.cfm?document_name=CTA-709.1 |title=CTA-709.1 : Control Network Protocol Specification}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications using LonWorks==
* [[Semiconductor device|Semiconductor]] [[manufacturing]]
* [[Lighting control system]]s
* [[Energy management system]]s
* [[HVAC|Heating/ventilation/air-conditioning systems]]
* [[Security systems]]
* [[Home automation]]
* [[Home appliance|Consumer appliance controls]]
* [[Street light|Public street lighting, monitoring, and control]]
* [[IFSF|Petrol station control]]
* [[Electronically controlled pneumatic braking|Rail Electronically Controlled Pneumatic Braking]]

==SNVTs (Standard Network Variable Types)==
One of the keys to the interoperability of the system is the standardisation of the variables used to describe physical things to LonWorks. This standards list is maintained by LonMark International and each standard is known as Standard Network Variable Types (SNVTs, pronounced "sniv-its"), so, for example, a thermostat using the temperature SNVT is expected to produce a number between zero and 65535 that corresponds to a temperature between [[Absolute zero|-274]] and 6279.5 degrees Celsius.

[[Image:Vasilchikov Diaries.jpg|right|Cover of "Berlin Diaries"]]
'''Marie Illarionovna Vassiltchikov''' ({{lang-ru|Мария Илларионовна Васильчикова}}; 11 January 1917 – 12 August 1978) was a [[Russians|Russian]] [[princess]] who wrote "Berlin Diaries, 1940-1945", which described the effects of the bombing of Berlin and events leading to the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler in the [[20 July Plot]].

==Early life==

Princess Marie ("Missie") Vassiltchikov was born in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]], in the waning days of the [[Russian Empire]], on 11 January 1917. She was the fourth child of a member of the [[Fourth Duma]], [[knyaz|Prince]] {{Interlanguage link multi|Hilarion Vassiltchikov|fr}} and his wife, the former Princess Lidiya Leonidovna [[Lidiya Vyazemskaya|Vyazemskaya]]. As members of the aristocracy, her parents fled Russia in 1919, following the [[Bolshevik]] [[October Revolution]] by joining a group of people who had been evacuated by the British fleet as described in the book ''Purgatory of fools: A memoir of the aristocrats' war in Nazi Germany'' by [[Tatiana von Metternich-Winneburg]]. [[King George V]] of the United Kingdom was the cousin of the last Tzar and maternal nephew of Empress [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Marie Feodorovna]]. King George V persuaded Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] to send a ship to the Crimea to save his aunt but the Empress refused to leave unless those who wished to leave with her were taken as well. The British sent additional ships to take the entire group including the Vassiltchikov family. Princess Marie lived as a refugee initially in the [[French Third Republic]], then [[Weimar Republic]] [[Germany]], and then [[Lithuania]] until just before the start of [[World War II]].

==Plot to kill Hitler==

In 1940, Princess Marie and her sister, Princess Tatiana Vassiltchikova (Tatiana von Metternich-Winneburg) (1915–2006), traveled to [[Berlin]] where, as stateless persons, they were able to obtain work permits.  After a brief period of employment with the Broadcasting Service, Vassiltchikov transferred to the [[Auswärtiges Amt]] (AA), or [[Foreign Office (Germany)|German Foreign Ministry]]'s Information Office, where she worked as the assistant to Dr. [[Adam von Trott zu Solz]], a key member of the [[German resistance to Nazism|anti-Nazi resistance]] and a former [[Rhodes scholar]].

Due to the tendency of Nazi party members to bypass the Foreign Ministry staff when formulating policy as described in Princess Marie's diaries, the A.A. effectively became a gathering place for civilian members of the anti-[[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi]] resisters including Adam von Trott zu Solz. In 1944, he was among the leaders of the 20 July Plot to kill [[Adolf Hitler]]. Princess Marie kept diaries of her life in the plotters' circle. She wrote in shorthand and kept the pages hidden in her A.A. office and in other locations but was not actively involved in the plot, although aware of its existence in general terms. In addition, her diaries detail the [[bombing of Berlin]], the daily life of what remained of Berlin's cosmopolitan pre-war [[nobility]] and [[intelligentsia]], and her own journey from privilege to near-death at the end of the war.

Following the failed attempt to kill Hitler, many of her friends and colleagues were imprisoned and a number were killed. Princess Marie and her friend Princess Elenore (Loremarie) von Schönburg went several times to [[Gestapo]] headquarters to plead for the life of Dr. von Trott zu Solz (among others) and to bring food and packages. Eventually, they were warned by a friendly guard not to return.

After Dr. von Trott zu Solz was executed in late August 1944, Princess Marie left Berlin and traveled to [[Vienna]], where she worked as a nurse until the end of the war.

==Post-war==

Princess Marie was found by the [[United States Third Army]] under the command of US Army General [[George S. Patton]] outside [[Gmunden]], Austria, on 4 May 1945. She worked as an interpreter for the army, but contracted [[scarlet fever]] and was transported to a hospital unit.

On 28 January 1946 Princess Marie Vassiltchikov married U.S. Army Captain Peter Graham Harnden of [[Military Intelligence]] (born in London on 9 April 1913). They settled in [[Paris]], where Harnden opened an architectural firm.  After Harnden died in [[Cadaqués]] on 15 October 1971, she moved to [[London]]. After her husband's death, she bowed to the wishes of friends and relatives who had been encouraging her to publish her wartime diaries. She died in London of [[leukemia]] on 12 August 1978. At the time, the task of editing and polishing her diaries was still incomplete; this task was completed by her brother George Vassiltchikov, who wrote an introduction.

Princess Marie Illarionovna Harnden was survived by her four children (Marina Harnden, born 15 September 1948; Anthony Peter Harnden, born in Paris on 13 February 1951, died in Cadaqués on 4 January 1999; Michael Christopher Harnden, born 10 October 1954; Alexandra Harnden, born 18 March 1956); her brother, Prince Yuri "Georgie" Vassiltchikov; and her sister, Princess [[Tatiana von Metternich-Winneburg]], who was married to [[Paul Alfons von Metternich-Winneburg]], a descendant of Prince [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich]], the prominent Austrian state chancellor and diplomat of the Napoleonic era.

==Berlin Diaries==

Vassiltchikov's diaries' description of the repeated bombing of [[Berlin]] during the war is considered one of the best testimonies of that experience.{{by whom|date=January 2013}}

The diaries are also important in that they chronicle a little-known aspect of Hitler's war crimes: the destruction of the aristocracy of Europe.  Hitler and the aristocracy had an uneasy relationship during the war.  After it became clear that many of the 20 July Plot participants were members of the aristocracy, Hitler used the assassination attempt as an excuse to wipe out many members of the prominent ruling families of Europe.

A poignant feature of Vassiltchikov's diary is its arc from the first pages in 1940 to its conclusion in 1945.  She begins by recounting a night spent dancing at a ball at the [[Chile]]an embassy and ends with her flight from Vienna, which found her stumbling, filthy and half-starved, across a bombed railroad depot at the end of the war.  Her account of wartime Berlin at times takes on an air of surreality as she writes about days that combined lunches at the [[Hotel Adlon]] and nights spent in half-ruined flats and conversations that ranged from gossip about her noble and royal friends to the intended killing of Hitler.

The cover (inside back) of the Chatto and Windus Ltd edition published in 1985 has reviews by various people, who praise the book and A.J.P.Taylor (historian)  describes it as "a remarkable historical document of the first importance." which answers the question of "by whom?" which is in the first line above. Also praised by Bernard Levin, and Auberon Waugh and a Daily Mail reviewer.

In [[accounting]], '''minority interest''' (or '''non-controlling interest''') is the portion of a subsidiary corporation's stock that is not owned by the parent corporation. The magnitude of the minority interest in the subsidiary company is generally less than 50% of [[shares outstanding|outstanding shares]], or the corporation would generally cease to be a subsidiary of the parent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.groco.com/readingroom/bus_dloc_mid.aspx. The Minority Interest Discount&lt;/ref&gt;

It is, however, possible (such as through special voting rights) for a controlling interest requiring consolidation to be achieved without exceeding 50% ownership, depending on the accounting standards being employed. Minority interest belongs to other investors and is reported on the consolidated [[balance sheet]] of the owning company to reflect the claim on [[assets]] belonging to other, non-controlling shareholders. Also, minority interest is reported on the consolidated [[income statement]] as a share of profit belonging to minority shareholders.

The reporting of 'minority interest' is a consequence of the requirement by [[accounting standards]] to 'fully' consolidate partly owned subsidiaries. Full consolidation, as opposed to partial consolidation, results in financial statements that are constructed as if the parent corporation fully owns these partly owned subsidiaries; except for two line items that reflect partial ownership of subsidiaries: net income to common shareholders and common equity. The two minority interest line items are the net difference between what would have been the common equity and net income to common, if all subsidiaries were fully owned, and the actual ownership of the group. All the other line items in the financial statements assume a fictitious 100% ownership.

Some investors have expressed concern that the minority interest line items cause significant uncertainty for the assessment of value, leverage and liquidity.&lt;ref&gt;http://eumedion.nl/en/public/knowledgenetwork/position-papers/position_paper_full_consolidation_of_partly_owned_subsidiaries_requires_additional_disclosure.pdf.  Position paper by corporate governance forum 'Eumedion'&lt;/ref&gt; A key concern of investors is that they cannot be sure what part of the reported cash position is owned by a 100% subsidiary and what part is owned by a 51% subsidiary.

Minority interest is an integral part of the [[enterprise value]] of a company. The converse concept is an [[associate company]].

==Accounting treatment==
Under the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]], the non-controlling interest is reported in accordance with [[IFRS 5]] and is shown at the very bottom of the Equity section on the consolidated [[balance sheet]] and subsequently on the [[statement of changes in equity]]. Under [[US GAAP]] minority interest can be reported either in the liabilities section, the equity section, or the mezzanine section of the balance sheet. The Mezzanine section is located between liabilities and equity. FASB FAS 160 and FAS 141r significantly alter the way a parent company accounts for non-controlling interest (NCI) in a subsidiary. It is no longer acceptable to report minority interest in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet.

The '''Newtown Act'''{{#tag:ref|The act was passed in the parliamentary session 1747–8, and is sometimes cited as the '''Newtown Act 1747'''&lt;ref name="Johnston-Liik2006"&gt;Johnston-Liik 2006, p.247&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Newtown Act 1748'''.&lt;ref&gt;Malcomson 1973&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}} (21 George II c.10) was an [[Act of Parliament|act]] of the [[Parliament of Ireland]] regulating [[municipal corporation]]s, in particular the manner in which [[parliamentary borough]]s elected members to the [[Irish House of Commons]].

==Provisions==
Clauses 1 to 7 aimed to curtail [[faggot voter]]s by requiring a [[rentcharge]] property qualification for the franchise to be either over ten [[Irish pound|pound]]s or else held for over one year prior to the election. This restricted temporary [[conveyancing]] of parts of a [[freehold (law)|freehold]] from its true owner to multiple fictitious owners. These provisions were an uncontentious technical amendment of an act passed in 1745 (19 George II c.11).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.law.umn.edu/irishlaw/19Geo2%20Ch11.htm|title=An Act for the better regulating Elections of Members to serve in Parliament.|work=Laws passed in Ireland for the Suppression of Popery|publisher=[[University of Minnesota]]|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oath required of electors under the 1745 act was amended by clause 5 of the Newtown Act to reflect the changed property restrictions. The revised oath restated unchanged the portion which prohibited [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Irish Roman Catholics]] from voting:
:I am not a [[Papist]], or married to a Papist, nor do I educate, or suffer to be educated, any of my children under the age of fourteen years in the popish religion.

Clause 8 was controversially appended to the bill at a late stage. It explicitly permitted non-residents to become burgesses (members of the corporation). Burgesses were the sole parliamentary electors in [[corporation borough]]s, and in [[freeman borough]]s they were also crucial since they had the power to grant or refuse [[freedom of the city|freeman status]]. The patrons of [[pocket borough]]s  ensured the burgesses were loyal [[Wikt:placeman|placemen]]. Permitting non-resident burgesses was necessary as only members of the [[established church|established]] [[Church of Ireland]] could be burgesses, and many boroughs were [[rotten borough]]s or otherwise underdeveloped places where few Protestants were willing to settle. This provision was stated to apply to boroughs other than [[City status in Ireland|those with city status]].  The 1835 Report of the Commissioners on Municipal Corporations in Ireland questioned whether it was applicable in the case of [[Armagh]] and [[Tuam]], both being episcopal sees and hence "cities" in [[William Blackstone]]'s definition in ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]''. In fact, non-residents had served on both corporations.&lt;ref name="Armagh-burgesses"&gt;Rep Comm Mun Corp Irl [https://books.google.com/books?id=lksSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA671 p.671–2 "City of Armagh" §10]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuam-burgesses"&gt;Rep Comm Mun Corp Irl [http://eppi.dippam.ac.uk/documents/10925/eppi_pages/245104 p.432 "Borough of Tuam" §13]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enactment==
The act's common name comes from [[Newtownards]] in [[County Down]], where the [[Newtownards (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Newtownards constituency]] was the subject of litigation between [[Brabazon Ponsonby, 1st Earl of Bessborough]] and [[Alexander Stewart (1699–1781)|Alexander Stewart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ancestryireland.com/history-of-the-irish-parliament/constituencies/newtownards/ |work=History of the Irish Parliament |title=Constituencies: Newtown(ards) }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1744 Stewart bought from Bessborough's unstable stepson Robert Colvill the [[manor]] of Newtown (later renaming its seat [[Mount Stewart]]).  Bessborough had been managing the borough within the manor for Colvill, and Stewart set about replacing Bessborough's appointees on its corporation, giving him control of its two MPs. Bessborough launched a court case in 1747, arguing that Stewart's burgesses were ineligible as they were not resident in the borough. This action prompted the addition of clause 8 to the bill.

The heads of the bill were reported by the [[Committee of the Whole House]] of Commons on 17 December 1747. The heads were then sent for pre-approval, as required by [[Poynings' Law]], to the [[Privy Council of Ireland]] in January 1748 and then the [[Privy Council of Great Britain]] in March 1748, both of which debated it strongly and made amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=https://books.google.ie/books?id=eAKiAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT59 |first=James |last=Kelly |chapter=The Privy Council of Ireland and the Making of Irish Laws 1692–1800  |editor-last1=Brown |editor-first1=Michael |editor-last2=Donlan |editor-first2=Seán Patrick |date=2013-07-28 |title=The Laws and Other Legalities of Ireland, 1689-1850 |publisher=Ashgate |page=64 |isbn=9781409482574 |accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petitions were considered from Stewart and from [[The Honourable The Irish Society|The Irish Society]]. The amended bill was returned to the Commons on 28 March and sent to the [[Irish House of Lords]] on 31 March.

==Historical opinion==
The act's negative reputation is ascribed by A. P. W.  Malcomson to [[James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont]], who called it "the most outrageous and unconstitutional that ever was enacted" in his 1783 memoirs, which present clause 8 as instigated by Stewart solely to win his court case. William Lynch in 1831 was also critical, stating that all [[ancient borough]]s in Ireland were ''de jure'' [[potwalloper]]s, under the [[common law]] as "enforced by the statutes of 10th Hen. VII. ch. 7,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HXhaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA46 "An Act that none be admitted Alderman, Juror, or Freeman in no Town, but if he have been Prentice or Inhabitant in the same."] Statutes at Large v.1 pp.46–47&lt;/ref&gt; and 33rd Hen. VIII";&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HXhaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA205 33 Hen. 8. Sess. 2. c. 1  "An Act for the Adjournment of the Parliament and the Place to hold the same, and what Persons shall be chosen Knights and Burgesses."] Statutes at Large v.1 pp.205–207&lt;/ref&gt; in this view the 1748 act was one of a series of encroachments on an ancient right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lynch|first=William |title=The law of election in the ancient cities and towns of Ireland traced from original records: With an appendix of documents |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SC8NAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=24 May 2017|year=1831|publisher=Effingham Wilson|location=London|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcomson argues that Charlemont's account is coloured by political bias and that clause 8 was "only simplifying and making more intelligible the legal position as it already stood". Malcomson accepts the court case as the motivation for clause 8, but suggests that MPs were not acting in Stewart's particular interest but from "dread and uncertainty" of a decision's effect on their own constituency. Stewart's case was decided in his favour in 1758, without reference to the Newtown Act. Malcomson suggests the act did not apply to the case as clause 8 was not retroactive, and that the clause's only effect was between 1748 and 1758, during which time it forestalled any copycat cases being started.

The allowance of non-resident burgesses has been presented as a worsening of the Irish House of Commons' unrepresentativeness, and as intended solely to increase the hold of patrons over their boroughs.  Malcomson disputes this, suggesting the patron's hold was tight in any case: "what was wrong with the burgesses ... was not that they were non-resident but that there were too few of them".  Malcomson posits disadvantages of restricting the franchise to residents, including the exclusion of progressive gentry living near but outside the borough, and the difficulty of determining a prospective voter's residency in cases where a borough's boundaries were irregular or uncertain.

The act's guarantee of the franchise to non-residents resulted in a transfer of power from the local gentry and bourgeois to the larger regional landholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnard|first=Toby|date=September 2003|title=Review: History of the Irish Parliament, 1692-1800 by E.

Johnston-Liik|journal=The English Historical Review|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=118|issue=478|pages=1008–1013: 1013 |jstor=3491145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter were interested mainly in controlling the borough's MPs, and not in its municipal affairs, causing an "ossification" in town government that lasted until the [[Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnston-Liik 2006, p.202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amendment and repeal==
The [[Catholic Relief Act 1793]] [[implied repeal|implicitly amended]] the Newtown Act, permitting Catholics to vote and specifying a different electoral oath.  Clauses (sections) 1–7 of the Newtown Act were repealed by an act of 1795 (35 George III c.29).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Statutes passed in the Parliaments held in Ireland.|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433035261639;view=1up;seq=148|volume=Vol.10|year=1799|publisher=George Grierson|location=Dublin|page=118|chapter=An act for regulating the election of members to serve in parliament, and for repealing the several acts therein mentioned.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Acts of Union 1800]] disenfranchised most Irish boroughs, and the corporations of many of these became defunct; clause 8 of the Newtown Act continued to apply to the remainder. In 1826, Sir [[Sir John Newport, 1st Baronet|John Newport]] tried unsuccessfully to introduced a bill to repeal clause 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1826/mar/09/non-resident-burgesses-in-ireland |title=NON-RESIDENT BURGESSES IN IRELAND |date=9 March 1826|work=Hansard|pages=vol 14 cc1247–53|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840]] abolished most corporations and reformed the remainder. This rendered the Newtown Act obsolete. Section 8 was repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision (Ireland) Act 1878]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1878/act/57/section/2/enacted/en/index.html|title=Statute Law Revision (Ireland) Act, 1878, Schedule|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire act (only the title and preamble remained) was not formally repealed in the [[Republic of Ireland]] until the [[Statute Law Revision Act 2007]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/isbc/pui1747.html|title=Pre-Union Irish Statutes Affected: 1747|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|publisher=Attorney General's office|accessdate=21 March 2014|location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Objectivist movement}}
The '''Objectivist movement''' is a [[Social movement|movement]] of individuals who seek to study and advance [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], the philosophy expounded by novelist-philosopher [[Ayn Rand]]. The movement began informally in the 1950s and consisted of students who were brought together by their mutual interest in Rand's novel, ''[[The Fountainhead]]''. The group, ironically named "the Collective" due to their actual advocacy of [[individualism]], in part consisted of [[Leonard Peikoff]], [[Nathaniel Branden]], [[Barbara Branden]], [[Alan Greenspan]], and [[Murray Rothbard]]. Nathaniel Branden, a young Canadian student who had been greatly inspired by Rand's work, became a close confidant and encouraged Rand to expand her philosophy into a formal movement. From this informal beginning in Rand's living room, the movement expanded into a collection of [[think tank]]s, academic organizations, and [[Objectivist periodicals|periodicals]].

==History==
===The Collective===
"The Collective" was Rand's private name&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=254}}. In public she referred to them as "the class of '43", after the year ''The Fountainhead'' was published. ''cf''. {{harvnb|Baker|1987|p=18}} and {{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for a group of close confidants, students, and proponents of Rand and Objectivism during the 1950s and 1960s. The founding members of the group were [[Nathaniel Branden]], [[Barbara Branden]], [[Leonard Peikoff]], [[Alan Greenspan]], [[Joan Kennedy Taylor]], Allan Blumenthal, Harry Kalberman, Elayne Kalberman, Joan Mitchell, and Mary Ann Sures (formerly Rukavina).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=88}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=254}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This group became the nucleus of a growing movement of Rand admirers whose name was chosen by Rand as a joke based on Objectivism's staunch commitment to [[individualism]].

The Collective originally started out as an informal gathering of friends (many of them related to one another) who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment on East 36th Street in [[New York City]] to discuss philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paxton|1998|p=156}}; {{harvnb|Greenspan|2007|p= 40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Branden said the group met "because of a common interest in ideas".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p= 254}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Greenspan recalled being drawn to Rand because of a shared belief in "the importance of mathematics and intellectual rigor".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenspan|2007|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group met at Rand's apartment at least once a week, and would often discuss and debate into the early morning hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenspan|2007|p= 40}}; {{harvnb|Paxton|1998|p= 156}}.&lt;/ref&gt; About these discussions, Greenspan said, "Talking to Ayn Rand was like starting a game of chess thinking I was good, and suddenly finding myself in checkmate."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenspan|2007|pp=40–41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Rand also allowed them to begin reading the manuscript of ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' (1957) as she completed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp= 254–255}}; {{harvnb|Paxton|1998|p= 156}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As the years went on, the Collective would proceed to play a larger, more formal role, promoting Rand's philosophy through the [[Nathaniel Branden Institute]] (NBI). Some Collective members gave lectures at the NBI in cities across the United States and wrote articles for its newsletters, ''[[Objectivist periodicals#The Objectivist Newsletter|The Objectivist Newsletter]]'' (1962–1965) and ''[[Objectivist periodicals#The Objectivist|The Objectivist]]'' (1966–1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=95}}; {{harvnb|Baker|1987|p= 18}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1999|p= 255}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp= 307, 312–313}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, after a complex series of events, Rand expelled Nathaniel and Barbara Branden from the Collective.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paxton|1998|p=142}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=101}}; {{harvnb|Rand|1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the subsequent years, the Collective slowly broke apart for numerous reasons. (Peikoff, Greenspan and Sures remained associated with Rand until her death. Rand expelled [[Kay Nolte Smith]], while Allan and Joan Mitchell Blumenthal and [[Robert Hessen]] left on their own.)&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp= 363–422}}, esp. "Denouement" and "Epilogue," and {{harvnb|Doherty|2007|pp= 537–538}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Peikoff eventually became Rand's legal heir and the person she described as the best teacher of her ideas, and has been called{{by whom?|date=October 2017}} Rand's "intellectual heir".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=387}}; {{harvnb|Doherty|2007|p=661n16}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Rand's death in 1982, Peikoff founded (1985) the [[Ayn Rand Institute]] to promote Objectivist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p= 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nathaniel Branden Institute===
{{Main article|Nathaniel Branden Institute}}
The first formal presentation of Objectivism began with the Nathaniel Branden Lectures (NBL), shortly after the publication of Rand's final novel, ''Atlas Shrugged''. Nathaniel Branden was the first member of The Collective, and later, Rand's "intellectual heir."&lt;ref name="passion"&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; In time, Branden and Rand became romantically involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the publication of ''Atlas Shrugged'', Rand was inundated with requests for more information about her philosophy. Not wanting to be a teacher or leader of an organized movement, she allowed Branden to lecture on her behalf.&lt;ref name="passion"/&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

The success of NBL prompted Branden to expand his lecture organization into the [[Nathaniel Branden Institute]] (NBI). Rand and Branden also co-founded the first publication devoted to the study and application of Objectivism. ''The Objectivist Newsletter'' began publication in 1962 and was later expanded into ''The Objectivist''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hessen|1999|pp=351–352}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s saw a rapid expansion of the Objectivist movement. Rand was a frequent lecturer at universities across the country. Rand hosted a radio program on Objectivism on the Columbia University station, [[WKCR-FM]]. The [[Nathaniel Branden Institute]] (NBI) hosted lectures on Objectivism, the history of philosophy, art, and psychology in cities across the country. Campus clubs devoted to studying Rand's philosophy formed throughout the country, though operated independently of NBI. Rand was a frequent guest on radio and television, as well as an annual lecturer at the Ford Hall Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the peak of its popularity, NBI was delivering taped lectures in over 80 cities.&lt;ref&gt;''The Objectivist Newsletter'' vol. 4 no. 12&lt;/ref&gt; By 1967 NBI had leased an entire floor in the [[Empire State Building]] (with ''The Objectivist'' as a sub-tenant).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=350, 373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Rand publicly broke with Nathaniel and Barbara Branden.&lt;ref name="Rand1968a"&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1968|p=449}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She accused Nathaniel Branden of a "gradual departure from the principles of Objectivism,"&lt;ref name="Rand1968a"/&gt; financial exploitation of her related to business loans, and "deliberate deception of several persons."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1968|pp=452–453}}; ''cf''. {{harvnb|Doherty|2007|p=334}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a response sent to the mailing list of ''The Objectivist'' in 1968, the Brandens denied many of Rand's charges against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=354–355}}; {{harvnb|Doherty|2007|pp=334–335}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The result of their conflicting claims was a "schism", as some participants in the Objectivist movement supported the Brandens, while others supported Rand's repudiation of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2007|pp=334–336}}; {{harvnb|Baker|1987|pp=24–25}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=355–356}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Walker|1999|pp=43–46}}. Baker and Walker both use the term "schism," as does {{harvnb|Peikoff|1989|pp=1, 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert L. Bradley, Jr.]] has called the dissolution of NBI an "organizational failure" in the Objectivist movement "as stunning as the collapse of Enron in a different context"; he charges Rand with "resorting to half-truths" and concludes that she "would never own up to the circumstances leading to the split, personally or publicly."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bradley Jr.|2009|pp=320, 327}} Bradley devotes Appendix A in his book (pp. 320–331) to "The Ayn Rand Problem."&lt;/ref&gt;

NBI was closed and its offices vacated, in an environment that Barbara Branden described as "total hysteria" as its former students learned about the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=351–352}}; ''cf''. {{harvnb|Rand|1968|p=455}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Brandens continued for a time to sell some of NBI's recorded lectures through a new company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Legal Notice |last=Holzer |first=Henry Mark |journal=The Objectivist |date=May 1969 |volume=8 |issue=5 |page=656 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; but otherwise had little involvement with the Objectivist movement until their biographical books about Rand were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986}} and {{harvnb|Branden|1999}}, which was originally released in 1989 under the title ''Judgment Day: My Years with Ayn Rand''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Objectivist'' continued publishing with Rand as editor and Leonard Peikoff as associate editor. Peikoff also took over Nathaniel Branden's role as the primary lecturer on Objectivism.&lt;ref name="Hessen 1999 p=353"&gt;{{harvnb|Hessen|1999|p=353}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Peikoff later described the Brandens' expulsion as the first "of the many schisms that have plagued the Objectivist movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1989|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
[[File:Leonard Peikoff.tiff|thumb|upright|alt=|Leonard Peikoff delivered lectures on Objectivism throughout the 1970s.]]
In the 1970s, Rand gave fewer public speeches. She concentrated instead on nonfiction writing and on helping the work of her students and associates, through efforts such as a series of private workshops on [[epistemology]] that she conducted from 1969 through 1971 for about a dozen students and professionals in philosophy, math and physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Objectivist'' was replaced by ''[[Objectivist periodicals#The Ayn Rand Letter|The Ayn Rand Letter]]'' in 1971. While ''The Objectivist'' had published articles by many authors, ''The Ayn Rand Letter,'' marketed as a personal newsletter from Rand, published only her work (plus occasionally Leonard Peikoff's).&lt;ref name="Hessen 1999 p=353"/&gt;

Throughout the decade, Peikoff continued to offer a number of lecture series on various topics related to Objectivism to large audiences, often incorporating new philosophic material.&lt;ref&gt;"Founders of Western Philosophy" (1972) and "The Philosophy of Objectivism" (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; Rand worked closely with Peikoff,&lt;ref name="own words"&gt;{{Cite AV media |people=Peikoff, Leonard |title=Leonard Peikoff in His Own Words |medium=DVD |publisher=Northern River Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt; helping edit his book, ''[[The Ominous Parallels]]'', for which she wrote the introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peikoff |first=Leonard |year=1982 |title=The Ominous Parallels |publisher=Plume |isbn=0-452-01117-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1979, Rand's associate [[Peter Schwartz (writer)|Peter Schwartz]] began editing and publishing ''[[Objectivist periodicals#The Intellectual Activist|The Intellectual Activist]]'', a publication which Rand recommended to her audience. Another associate of hers during this period was [[Harry Binswanger]], whom she advised on his mini-encyclopedia of Objectivism, ''The Ayn Rand Lexicon: Objectivism from A to Z'' (1986).&lt;ref&gt;New American Library, 1986; online at www.aynrandlexicon.com&lt;/ref&gt; After the close of ''The Objectivist Calendar,'' a short publication listing upcoming events within the Objectivist movement, Binswanger began editing and publishing ''The Objectivist Forum'', a bimonthly journal on Objectivism which had Rand's support and for which she served as "philosophic consultant."&lt;ref&gt;"To the Readers of the Objectivist Forum," ''The Objectivist Forum,'' vol. 1, no. 1 (Feb. 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
Upon Rand's death on March 6, 1982, Peikoff inherited her estate, including the control of the copyrights to her books and writing (barring ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'', in the public domain). Shortly after Rand's death, Peikoff's first book, ''The Ominous Parallels'', was published. In 1983, Peikoff gave a series of lectures titled ''Understanding Objectivism'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Announcements |journal=The Objectivist Forum |date=June 1983 |volume=3 |issue=3 |page=16 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the purpose of improving the ''methodology'' used in studying Objectivism, as a corrective to what he describes as the "Rationalist" and the "Empiricist" methods of thought.

A high-quality bimonthly philosophical journal, [[The Objectivist Forum]], was published from 1980 to 1987. 

In 1985, Leonard Peikoff and [[Ed Snider]] founded the [[Ayn Rand Institute]] (ARI), the first organization devoted to the study and advocacy of Objectivism since the closure of NBI in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Announcements |journal=[[Objectivist periodicals#The Objectivist Forum|The Objectivist Forum]] |date= December 1984 |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute began by sponsoring essay contests on Rand's novels and distributing op-eds analyzing world events from an Objectivist perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Report from the Ayn Rand Institute |journal=[[Objectivist periodicals#The Objectivist Forum|The Objectivist Forum]] |last=Berliner |first=Michael S. |date=October 1985 |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, the institute began teaching aspiring Objectivist academics.&lt;ref&gt;''Impact'' (newsletter of the Ayn Rand Institute), June 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peikoff–Kelley split===
In 1989, another major split occurred within the Objectivist movement. As [[Brian Doherty (journalist)|Brian Doherty]] describes it, [[David Kelley]], a philosopher and lecturer then affiliated with ARI, was "booted from the official Objectivist world" for disagreeing "about the inherent evils of Barbara Branden's Rand biography [''[[The Passion of Ayn Rand]]'']" and "''publicly defend[ing] on principle'' the notion of Objectivists talking to libertarians."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2007|pp=538–539}}; the italics are Doherty's.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelley was criticized by [[Peter Schwartz (writer)|Peter Schwartz]] for giving a speech under the auspices of [[Laissez Faire Books]] (LFB), a libertarian [[bookseller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelley|2000|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz argued that this activity violated the Objectivist moral principle of sanction. In other words, Kelley was implicitly conferring moral approval on the organization by appearing at an event that it sponsored. LFB, in turn, was morally objectionable because it promoted books, such as ''The Passion of Ayn Rand'' (1986), that Schwartz maintained were hostile and defamatory towards Rand and Objectivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On Sanctioning the Sanctioners |journal=The Intellectual Activist |date=February 27, 1989 |volume=4 |issue=20 |first=Peter |last=Schwartz |page=1 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Although Schwartz made no mention of it, Leonard Peikoff had signed copies of his book ''The Ominous Parallels'' at three LFB events in 1982. According to Peikoff, he later broke off relations with LFB after being told that LFB offered [[Anarchism|anarchist]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ramsey |first=Bruce |date=January–February 2008 |title=''Laissez-Faire'': R.I.P.? |journal=Liberty |volume=22 |issue=1 |url=http://www.libertyunbound.com/archive/2008_01/ramsey-lf.html |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Kelley responded, in a paper titled "A Question of Sanction", by disputing Schwartz's interpretation of the sanction principle in particular and his interpretation of moral principles in general.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley's paper was at first circulated privately, but is reproduced as an appendix in {{harvnb|Kelley|2000|pp=113–117}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in an essay appearing in ''The Intellectual Activist'', Peikoff endorsed Schwartz's view and claimed that Kelley's arguments contradicted the fundamental principles of Objectivism. Peikoff maintained that many non-Objectivist systems of thought, such as Marxism, are based on "inherently dishonest ideas" whose advocacy must never be sanctioned.&lt;ref name="Peikoff"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fact and Value |journal=The Intellectual Activist |date=May 18, 1989 |volume=5 |issue=1 |first=Leonard |last=Peikoff |url=http://ari.aynrand.org/issues/culture-and-society/religion-and-morality/Fact-and-Value}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attributed the fall of NBI and subsequent schisms not to "differences in regard to love affairs or political strategy or proselytizing techniques or anybody's personality," but to a "fundamental and philosophical" cause: "if you grasp and accept the concept of 'objectivity,' in all its implications, then you accept Objectivism, you live by it and you revere Ayn Rand for defining it. If you fail fully to grasp and accept the concept, whether your failure is deliberate or otherwise, you eventually drift away from Ayn Rand's orbit, or rewrite her viewpoint or turn openly into her enemy." Those who criticized his position were to make their exit: "if you agree with the Branden or Kelley viewpoint or anything resembling it—please drop out of our movement: drop Ayn Rand, leave Objectivism alone. We do not want you and Ayn Rand would not have wanted you [...]"&lt;ref name="Peikoff"/&gt;

Kelley responded to the Peikoff–Schwartz critique in his monograph, "Truth and Toleration", later updated as ''The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Truth and Toleration |last=Kelley |first=David |location=Verbank, New York |publisher=Institute for Objectivist Studies |year=1990}} Revised as {{harvnb|Kelley|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He responded to his ostracism by founding the Institute for Objectivist Studies (IOS), later renamed The Objectivist Center (TOC) and then [[The Atlas Society]] (TAS), with the help of Ed Snider, one of the founders of the Ayn Rand Institute. Kelley was joined by Objectivist scholars George Walsh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Statement |journal=The Intellectual Activist |date=November 17, 1989 |volume=5 |issue=3 |first=George |last=Walsh |page=5 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jim Lennox, as well as former Collective members Joan and Allan Blumenthal.&lt;ref name="iossem95"&gt;IOS Summer Seminar (1995). Faculty Biographies. http://www.objectivistcenter.org/events/oldsems/seminars-sem95.asp#fac Accessed July 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
Kelley's Institute for Objectivist Studies began to publish material on Objectivism and host conferences for Rand scholars in 1990. IOS held a symposium on [[Chris Matthew Sciabarra]]'s book, ''[[Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical]]'' (1995).&lt;ref name="harvnb|Sciabarra|1995"&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; IOS invited Nathaniel&lt;ref name="iossem96"&gt;IOS Summer Seminar (1996). http://www.objectivistcenter.org/events/oldsems/seminars-sem96.asp#pers Accessed July 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and Barbara Branden&lt;ref name="iossem99"&gt;IOS Summer Seminar (1999). http://www.objectivistcenter.org/events/sem99/seminars-sem99.asp Accessed July 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; to participate in the institute's activities, effectively bringing them back into the Objectivist movement, and they continued to appear at events for the organization until their deaths in 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 1999, IOS renamed itself to The Objectivist Center.

In 1991, Peikoff's book ''[[Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand]]'' was published. It was the first comprehensive presentation of Rand's philosophy to appear in print. In 1994, the Ayn Rand Institute expanded its educational programs into the Objectivist Graduate Center (OGC), which held classes led by Leonard Peikoff and Harry Binswanger. 1996 saw a series of lectures on Objectivism by ARI intellectuals at [[Harvard University|Harvard]].&lt;ref name="Impact December 2006"&gt;''Impact'' December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; ARI increased its notoriety by staging a protest against President Clinton's volunteerism initiative in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aynrand2.org/no_servitude/update.html ARI website]&lt;/ref&gt; ARI gathered more attention for its activism on behalf of the family of Elian Gonzalez. 1996 saw the release of the Academy Award-nominated documentary ''[[Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life]]'', directed by [[Michael Paxton]]. In 1999, the United States Postal Service released an Ayn Rand stamp.&lt;ref&gt;''Impact'' April 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
[[File:Yaron Brook at Tea Party Patriots.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=|Yaron Brook was executive director of ARI from 2000 to 2017.]]
In 2000, [[Yaron Brook]] succeeded Michael Berliner as head of ARI,&lt;ref&gt;''Impact'' March 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and ARI expanded its OGC into the Objectivist Academic Center (OAC), offering undergraduate and graduate courses on Objectivism, writing, history, the history of philosophy, and the history of science.&lt;ref&gt;''Impact'' September 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Several OAC classes are now accredited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=education_academic_index OAC website]&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 2000s, ARI increased its media presence, publishing op-eds and providing intellectuals for live interviews. In 2005, ARI helped establish the Ayn Rand Institute Canada, which distributes free books to Canadian schools. In 2006, ARI sponsored a conference on the [[War on Terror]]. In addition to Objectivist speakers, mid-east scholars [[Daniel Pipes]], [[Robert Spencer (author)|Robert Spencer]], and Danish newspaper editor [[Flemming Rose]] gave lectures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.objectivistconferences.com/fordhall06/ The Jihad Against the West]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, ARI had donated 700,000 copies of Rand's novels to high schools around the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Impact'' February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Objectivist Center also went through a number of changes in the 2000s. In 2005, founder David Kelley stepped aside as executive director in favor of former [[Cato Institute]] scholar Ed Hudgins, while Kelley stayed on as Chief Intellectual Officer, and the institute relocated to Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.objectivistcenter.org/center/news/news_dc-announcement.asp |title=The Objectivist Center to Move to DC |date=December 15, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051119034917/http://www.objectivistcenter.org/center/news/news_dc-announcement.asp |archivedate=November 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the organization rebranded itself again, changing its name to The Atlas Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.objectivistcenter.org/cth-13-1712-The_Atlas_Society_and_TheObjectivist_Center_names.aspx |title=The Atlas Society and The Objectivist Center Names |publisher=The Atlas Society |date=June 5, 2006 |accessdate=June 16, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312070701/http://www.objectivistcenter.org/cth-13-1712-The_Atlas_Society_and_TheObjectivist_Center_names.aspx |archivedate=March 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Domingo García founded Objetivismo Internacional (OI) in [[Spain]] to help spread Objectivism in the [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlasnetwork.org/partners/global-directory/objetivismo-internacional |title=Objetivismo Internacional |website=AtlasNetwork.com |accessdate=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; OI is not officially affiliated with any other Objectivist organization; however, they closely collaborate with the Ayn Rand Institute. OI is based in [[Murcia|Murcia, Spain]], and García is its [[Chief executive officer|CEO]].&lt;ref name="objetivismo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://objetivismo.org/about-us/ |title=About Us |website=Objetivismo.org |accessdate=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
A central goal for ARI throughout the 2010s has been to spread Objectivism internationally. ARI helped establish the Ayn Rand Center Israel in October 2012, the Ayn Rand Institute Europe in April 2015, and the Ayn Rand Center Japan in February 2017. Each of these institutions are affiliated with ARI but are separate legal entities. In 2017, Jim Brown replaced Yaron Brook as the operational executive of ARI, while Brook continues as its chairman of the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/entertainment/tn-wknd-et-0219-ayn-rand-institute-20170218-story.html |title=Jim Brown, new Ayn Rand Institute CEO: 'Culture and society out there can look pretty irrational.

In 2014, Carl Barney launched the Objectivist Venture Fund, originally the Anthem Venture Fund, which has helped fund a number of Objectivist initiatives, including ''[[Objectivist periodicals#The Undercurrent|The Undercurrent]]'' and the Ayn Rand Center Israel.&lt;ref name="OCON 2015"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbWgESQV9Eo&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Ayn Rand Center Israel launched the Atlas Award for the Best Israeli Start-up, presented annually at the [[Tel Aviv Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name="JPost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Business-and-Innovation/Tech-Talk-Israels-Fortune-500-companies-496935 |title=Tech Talk: Israel's Fortune 500 companies |author=Shapira, Ariel |website=JPost.com |access-date=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judges for the award include Yaron Brook and [[Shlomo Kalish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-spirit-of-ayn-rand-israeli-entrepreneurship-to-get-a-boost/ |title=In spirit of Ayn Rand, Israeli entrepreneurship to get a boost |website=TimesofIsrael.com |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moovit]] was the first recipient of the award in 2016.

In 2016, Objetivismo USA was established as a [[501(c)3]] [[nonprofit organization]] in [[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|New York]] as a sister organization of Objetivismo Internacional.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nycompanygo.com/Objetivismo-Usa-Inc-4904832/&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] is Edwin Thompson.&lt;ref name="objetivismo"/&gt;

The Atlas Society has also undergone a change in leadership in the 2010s. In 2011, Aaron Day replaced Ed Hudgins as the operational executive of The Atlas Society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/10/prweb9884847.htm |title=The Atlas Society Announces Aaron Day as New CEO and Appoints New Board of Advisors |publisher=PRWeb |date=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on March 1, 2016, The Atlas Society announced Jennifer Grossman as its new CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://atlassociety.org/about-us/about-us-archive/5947-jennifer-anju-grossman-ceo|title=The Atlas Society welcomes Jennifer Anju Grossman as its new CEO|work=The Atlas Society|access-date=August 10, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectivism in academia==
Despite the fact that several members of the Collective were philosophy graduate students at [[New York University|NYU]],&lt;ref name="own words"/&gt; Objectivism did not begin to make serious inroads into academic philosophy until the 1980s. Rand herself had much disdain for modern academia, citing the poor state of American universities, particularly the [[humanities]], as the source of much of the country's problems,&lt;ref name="new intellectual"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |title=For the New Intellectual |publisher=Signet |isbn=0-451-16308-7 |year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Peikoff expressed similar sentiments in the early 1990s, declaring that his book on Objectivism was "written not for academics, but for human beings (including any academics who qualify)."&lt;ref name="opar"&gt;{{cite book |last=Peikoff |first=Leonard |year=1993 |title=[[Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand]] |location=New York |publisher=Meridian |page=xiv |isbn=978-0-452-01101-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ayn Rand Institute initially concentrated on promoting Objectivism independently of academia, supplying free books to high schools and universities, sponsoring essay contests for students and support programs for teachers and professors interested in studying and teaching Rand's ideas.&lt;ref name="About ARI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_ari |title=About ARI |accessdate=July 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some limited academic attention was given to Objectivism in the 1970s. In 1971, William F. O'Neill published ''With Charity toward None: An Analysis of Ayn Rand's Philosophy'', in which he provides an academic discussion of Objectivism. Although he alleges flaws in Rand's thinking, he expresses admiration for her efforts, and particularly her ability to motivate readers to think about philosophical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=With Charity Toward None: An Analysis of Ayn Rand's Philosophy |last=O'Neill |first=William F. |location=New York |publisher=Philosophical Library |year=1971 |isbn=0-8022-2034-7}}; cf. discussion of O'Neill's book in {{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There was occasional discussion of Rand in scholarly journals throughout the rest of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite journal |title=On the Randian Argument |last=Nozick |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Nozick |journal=The Personalist |date=Spring 1971 |volume=52 |pages=282–304}}; {{cite journal |title=The Extroflective Hero: A Look at Ayn Rand |last=Gordon |first=Philip |journal=[[The Journal of Popular Culture]] |date=Autumn 1977 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=701–710 |doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1977.1004_701.x}}; {{cite journal |title=Ayn Rand and Feminism: An Unlikely Alliance |last=Gladstein |first=Mimi R. |journal=[[College English]] |date=February 1978 |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=25–30 |doi=10.2307/375869}}; and {{cite journal |title=Nozick On the Randian Argument |last1=Den Uyl |first1= Douglas |last2=Rasmussen |first2=Douglas |journal=[[Pacific Philosophical Quarterly|The Personalist]] |date=April 1978 |volume=59 |pages=184–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirteen years later, the second book-length academic study of Objectivism appeared. It was a collection of essays called ''[[The Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand]]'' (1984), edited by Douglas Den Uyl and Douglas Rasmussen. It was also the first book about Rand's thought to be published after her death. Den Uyl and Rasmussen made a specific effort to bring more serious scholarly attention to Objectivism by maintaining high scholarly standards for the essays in their book.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|pp=101–102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, noted [[Aristotle]] scholar and Rand student [[Allan Gotthelf]] co-founded the Ayn Rand Society with George Walsh and David Kelley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=William |last=Thomas |title=Ayn Rand Through Two Lenses |journal=Navigator |date=April 2000 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=15–19 |url=http://www.atlassociety.org/on-ayn-rand-gotthelf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is affiliated with the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Non-Objectivist participants have included [[Jaegwon Kim]] and [[Susan Haack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrandsociety.org |title=Ayn Rand Society |accessdate=May 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Chris Matthew Sciabarra published ''Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical'', an academic study of Rand's ideas and intellectual history.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Sciabarra|1995"/&gt; Rand bibliographer [[Mimi Reisel Gladstein]] called Sciabarra's work "a significant milestone in Rand studies."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=106}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, Sciabarra declared a "renaissance" in the scholarship about Rand, noting that his book was only "one of fifteen book titles dealing with Rand that have been published since 1995, along with countless articles and other references to her work."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1998|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also noted that not all of the material carried "deep scholarly interest."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1998|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[John P. McCaskey]] founded the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship, which sponsors the work of professors affiliated with the Ayn Rand Institute.&lt;ref&gt;''Impact'' July 2003&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007 there were 13 such fellowships for the study of Objectivism in universities in the U.S., including at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and the [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;ref name="About ARI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Erika |last=Fricke |url=http://www.umc.pitt.edu/pittmag/summer2004/cornerstones.html |title=Follow Reason: An Objectivist Viewpoint |journal=Pitt Magazine |date=Summer 2004 |accessdate=July 25, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611011903/http://www.umc.pitt.edu/pittmag/summer2004/cornerstones.html |archivedate=June 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Anthem Foundation in conjunction with the [[University of Pittsburgh]] hosted a conference on the philosophy of science called "Concepts and Objectivity: Knowledge, Science, and Values." Participants included Objectivists [[Onkar Ghate]], [[Allan Gotthelf]], James G. Lennox, [[Harry Binswanger]], and [[Tara Smith (philosopher)|Tara Smith]], as well as noted analytic philosophers [[David Sosa]], [[Aloysius Martinich|A. P. Martinich]], and [[Peter Railton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~hpsdept/news/news/ConceptsObjConf2006.pdf |format=PDF |title=Concepts and Objectivity |year=2006 |accessdate=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Objectivists, not all of whom are affiliated with ARI, have received support from the BB&amp;T Charitable Foundation's program to support the study of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BB&amp;T Programs |url=http://business.clemson.edu/BBTCENTER/cci/capres/bbtp/bbtp.html |accessdate=July 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010 McCaskey was forced to resign from the [[Ayn Rand Institute]] and subsequently resigned from the Anthem Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Ayn Rand Institute vs. John McCaskey |url=http://ariwatch.com/WhosWho/ARIvsJohnMcCaskey.htm |accessdate=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Cambridge University Press]] published [[Tara Smith (philosopher)|Tara Smith]]'s book, ''Ayn Rand’s Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Tara |year=2006 |title=Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-86050-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1999, ''[[The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies]]'', edited by [[Stephen D. Cox]], Chris Matthew Sciabarra, and [[R. W. Bradford]] (until his death in 2005), has been published semi-annually as a "nonpartisan," scholarly forum for the discussion of Rand's work and its application to many fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrandstudies.com/jars/index.asp |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020915022014/http://www.aynrandstudies.com/jars/index.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 15, 2002 |title=The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies |accessdate=July 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Journal'' is published by the ''Pennsylvania University Press'' and archived at Stanford University's CLOCKSS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/notablog/archives/001776.html|title=Notablog of Christopher Matthew Sciabarra|last=Sciabarra|first=Christopher Matthew|date=September 10, 2012|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of its editors have been aligned with the Ayn Rand Institute, and no one affiliated with ARI has participated in its exchanges since 2002.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

===Student activism===

Objectivism has remained popular on college campuses, with dozens of student groups dedicated to promoting and studying the philosophy of Objectivism&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; spread across the U.S., Australia, Canada, Guatemala,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Leftist thinking left off the syllabus |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-guatemala6-2008jun06,0,5560223.story |accessdate=May 30, 2009 |first=Marla |last=Dickerson |date=June 6, 2008 |work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A growing concern |first=David |last=Cohen |date=December 7, 2001 |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/dec/07/internationaleducationnews.highereducation |accessdate=May 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These clubs often present speakers on controversial topics such as abortion, religion, and foreign policy, often allying with conservative (and sometimes liberal) organizations to organize their events. For example, the [[New York University]] Objectivism Club hosted a joint panel on the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Muhammad cartoons]] that received nationwide coverage for NYU's censorship of the cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=To Show or Not to Show Muhammad Cartoon |date=March 20, 2006 |first=David |last=Epstein |work=Inside Higher Education |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/03/30/cartoon |accessdate=May 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several dozen speakers sponsored by the Ayn Rand Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ARC Speakers &amp; Writers|url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=media_speakers_writers |accessdate=May 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other organizations who give nationwide tours each year speaking about Objectivism.

The Ayn Rand Institute has spent $5 million on educational programs advancing Objectivism, including scholarships and clubs. These clubs often obtain educational materials and speakers from ARI. There are also several conferences organized by various organizations, which draw several hundred attendees each summer and feature philosophy courses and presentations of new publications and research. A student-run magazine, ''The Undercurrent'', is published for colleges around the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''The Undercurrent''|url=http://the-undercurrent.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405214345/http://the-undercurrent.com/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 5, 2005|accessdate=May 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
There are a number of writers who cannot be classified as Objectivist but who still exhibit a significant influence of Objectivism in their own work. Prominent among these is [[John Hospers]], Emeritus Professor of Philosophy, [[University of Southern California]], who credited Rand's political ideas as helping to shape his own,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hospers |first=John |year=1971 |title=Libertarianism |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Nash}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in other areas sharp differences remained. Another is [[Murray Rothbard]], who, like Rand, advocated volition, [[Aristotle]] and [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]],&lt;ref&gt;''Individualism and the Methodology of the Social Sciences'', Cato Paper no. 4, [[Cato Institute]], 1979, and ''[[The Ethics of Liberty]]'', Humanities Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; but who also advocated [[anarchism]], which was anathema to Rand. Also in this category are journalist [[Edith Efron]], scientist [[Petr Beckmann]], and author [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]].

==Criticisms and responses==
===Criticisms===
Over the years, some critics have accused the Objectivist movement of being a [[cult]] or cult-like, and Rand of being a cult figure. The term 'Randroid' (a [[portmanteau]] of 'Rand' and '[[Android (robot)|android]]') has been used to evoke the image of "the [[John Galt|Galt]]-imitating robots produced by the cult."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|1999|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suggestions of cult-like behavior by Objectivists began during the NBI days. With growing media coverage, articles began appearing that referred to the "Cult of Ayn Rand" and compared her to various religious leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|pp=111–112}}. Gladstein cites articles titled "The Curious Cult of Ayn Rand", "The Cult of Ayn Rand", and "The Cult of Angry Ayn Rand", and comparisons of Rand to [[Joan of Arc]] and [[Aimee Semple McPherson]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terry Teachout]] described NBI as "a quasi-cult which revolved around the adoration of Ayn Rand and her fictional heroes," one that "disintegrated" when Rand split with Nathaniel Branden.&lt;ref name="teachout"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Teachout |first=Terry |date=July 1986 |title=The Goddess That Failed |work=Commentary |url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/the-passion-of-ayn-rand--by-barbara-branden-7163}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, psychologist [[Albert Ellis]], in the wake of a public debate with Nathaniel Branden, published a book arguing that Objectivism was a religion, whose practices included "sexual Puritanism," "absolutism," "damning and condemning," and "deification" of Ayn Rand and her fictional heroes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Is Objectivism A Religion? |last=Ellis |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Ellis |location=New York |publisher=Lyle Stuart |year=1968}} Ellis did not employ the word "cult."&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoirs, Nathaniel Branden said of the Collective and NBI that "there was a cultish aspect to our world [...] We were a group organized around a charismatic leader, whose members judged one another's character chiefly by loyalty to that leader and her ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Branden |first=Nathaniel |year=1989 |title=Judgment Day: My Years with Ayn Rand |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |page=256 |isbn=0-395-46107-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, libertarian author [[Murray Rothbard]] began privately circulating an essay on "The Sociology of the Ayn Rand Cult", in which he wrote:
{{quote|If the glaring inner contradictions of the [[Leninism|Leninist]] cults make them intriguing objects of study, still more so is the Ayn Rand cult&amp;nbsp;... [f]or not only was the Rand cult explicitly atheist, anti-religious, and an extoller of Reason; it also promoted slavish dependence on the guru in the name of independence; adoration and obedience to the leader in the name of every person's individuality; and blind emotion and faith in the guru in the name of Reason.&lt;ref name="Rothbard"&gt;{{cite web |first=Murray |last=Rothbard |authorlink=Murray Rothbard |title=The Sociology of the Ayn Rand Cult |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard23.html |accessdate=May 31, 2009}} Rothbard's essay was later revised and printed as a pamphlet by ''[[Liberty (libertarian magazine)|Liberty]]'' magazine in 1987, and by the Center for Libertarian Studies in 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rothbard also wrote that "the guiding spirit of the Randian movement was not individual liberty&amp;nbsp;... but rather personal power for Ayn Rand and her leading disciples."&lt;ref name="Rothbard"/&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Michael Shermer]] argued that the Objectivist movement displayed characteristics of religious cults such as the veneration and inerrancy of the leader; hidden agendas; financial and/or sexual exploitation; and the beliefs that the movement provides absolute truth and absolute morality. Shermer maintained that certain aspects of Objectivist epistemology and ethics promoted cult-like behavior:
{{quote|[A]s soon as a group sets itself up to be the final moral arbiter of other people's actions, especially when its members believe they have discovered absolute standards of right and wrong, it is the beginning of the end of tolerance, and thus reason and rationality. It is this characteristic more than any other that makes a cult, a religion, a nation, or any other group, dangerous to individual freedom. Its absolutism was the biggest flaw in Ayn Rand's Objectivism, the unlikeliest cult in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Why People Believe Weird Things]] |last=Shermer |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Shermer |chapter=The Unlikeliest Cult |year=1997 |publisher=W.H.

In 1999, Jeff Walker published ''The Ayn Rand Cult''. In one passage, Walker compared Objectivism to the [[Dianetics]] practices of [[Scientology]], which is considered by many to be a cult. Both, argues Walker, are totalist sets of beliefs that advocate "an ethics for the masses based on survival as a rational being." Walker continues, "Dianetics used reasoning somewhat similar to Rand's about the brain as a machine. ... Both have a higher mind reprogramming the rest of the mind." Walker further notes that both philosophies claim to be based on science and logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker1999|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker's book has drawn criticism from Rand scholars. Chris Matthew Sciabarra criticized Walker's objectivity and scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sciabarra |first=Chris Matthew |authorlink=Chris Matthew Sciabarra |title=Books for Rand Studies | url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/essays/cult.htm |journal=Full Context |volume=11 |issue=4 |date=March–April 1999 |pages=9–11 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mimi Reisel Gladstein]] wrote that Walker's thesis is "questionable and often depends on innuendo, rather than logic."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[R. W. Bradford]] called it "merely annoying" for scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bradford |first=R.W. |journal=Liberty |volume=13 |issue=2 |title=Ayn Rant |date=February 1999 |url=http://www.libertysoft.com/liberty/reviews/70bradford2.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050211153421/http://www.libertysoft.com/liberty/reviews/70bradford2.html |archivedate=February 11, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The claims of cultism have continued in more recent years. In 2004, [[Thomas Szasz]] wrote in support of Rothbard's 1972 essay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2004 |title=Faith in Freedom: Libertarian Principles and Psychiatric Practices |last=Szasz |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Szasz |pages=124–126 |location=New Brunswick, New Jersey |publisher=Transaction Books |isbn=0-7658-0244-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2006, Albert Ellis published an updated edition of his 1968 book that included favorable references to Walker's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Are Capitalism, Objectivism, and Libertarianism Religions? Yes! |last=Ellis |first=Albert |location=Santa Barbara, California |publisher=Walden Three |year=2006 |isbn=1-4348-0885-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Walter Block]], while expressing admiration for some of Rand's ideas and noting her strong influence on [[libertarianism]], described the Objectivist movement as "a tiny imploding cult."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Block |first=Walter |date=Summer 2000 |url=http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/26/rp_26_4.pdf |title=Libertarianism vs Objectivism; A Response to Peter Schwartz |work=Reason Papers |issue=26 |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses===
Rand stated that "I am not a cult",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q7cje1I3VM |title=Ayn Rand Phil Donahue Part 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said in 1961 that she did not want "blind followers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |title=[[Letters of Ayn Rand]] |editor-first=Michael S. |editor-last=Berliner |location=New York |publisher=Dutton |year=1995 |isbn=0-525-93946-6 |page=592}} In a letter to Ida Macken (December 10, 1961), Rand wrote, "A ''blind follower'' is precisely what my philosophy condemns and what I reject. Objectivism is not a mystic cult." (emphasis in original)&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of NBI's collapse, she declared that she did not even want an organized movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1968a|p=471}} "I want, therefore, to make it emphatically clear that Objectivism is not an organized movement and is not to be regarded as such by anyone."&lt;/ref&gt;

Jim Peron responded to Shermer, Rothbard and others with an argument that similarities to cults are superficial at best and charges of cultism directed at Objectivists are ''[[ad hominem]]'' attacks. Objectivism, he said, lacks layers of initiation, a hierarchy, obligation, cost or physical coercion:
{{quote|I cannot see how a disembodied philosophy can be a cult. I say Objectivism was disembodied because there was no Objectivist organization to join. The Nathaniel Branden Institute gave lectures, but had no membership. You could subscribe to a newsletter but you couldn't join. Objectivism was, and is, structureless. And without a structure there cannot be cult. [...] The vast majority of self-proclaimed Objectivists are people who read Rand's works and agreed with her. Most have never attended an Objectivist meeting nor subscribed to any Objectivist newsletter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peron |first=Jim |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021014162005/http://www.zolatimes.com/V4.31/obj_cult4.html |url=http://www.zolatimes.com/V4.31/obj_cult4.html |title=Is Objectivism a Cult?

In 2001, Rand's long-time associate Mary Ann Sures remarked:
{{quote|Some critics have tried to turn her certainty into a desire on her part to be an authority in the bad sense, and they accuse her of being dogmatic, of demanding unquestioning agreement and blind loyalty. They have tried, but none successfully, to make her into the leader of a cult, and followers of her philosophy into cultists who accept without thinking everything she says. This is a most unjust accusation; it's really perverse. ''Unquestioning agreement is precisely what Ayn Rand did not want.'' She wanted you to think and act independently, not to accept conclusions because she said so, but because you reached them by using your mind in an independent and firsthand manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Facets of Ayn Rand |last1=Sures |first1=Mary Ann |last2=Sures |first2=Charles |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-9625336-5-3 |url=http://www.facetsofaynrand.com/ |lastauthoramp=y |page=29}} (emphasis in original)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Meanwhile, Shermer, who considers himself an admirer of Rand, has tempered his judgment. Contrasting Leonard Peikoff's "heavy-hammer approach" with the "big-tent approach" of The Atlas Society, Shermer told Ed Hudgins: "If we're close enough on the same page about many things, I think it's more useful to cut people some slack, rather than going after them on some smaller points. I don't see the advantage of saying, 'You shouldn't have liked that movie because ultimately, if you were an Objectivist, you wouldn't have.' I guess it was those sorts of judgments made by some Objectiv[ists] that I objected to."&lt;ref name="shermertni"&gt;{{cite web |first=Edward |last=Hudgins |title=Interview with Michael Shermer |date=January–February 2007 |work=The New Individualist |publisher=The Objectivist Center |url=http://www.atlassociety.org/tni/tnis-interview-michael-shermer |accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2908">'''Partnership taxation''' is the concept of taxing a [[Partnership|partnership business entity]].  Many jurisdictions regulate partnerships and the taxation thereof differently.

==Common law==
Many common law jurisdictions apply a concept called "flow through taxation" to partnerships.  Partnerships are a [[flow-through entity]] where the taxes are assessed at the entity level but which are applied to the partners of the partnership.

===USA===
{{Main|Partnership taxation (USA)}}

Partnership taxation is codified as Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of the [[Internal Revenue Code|U.S. Internal Revenue Code]] (Title 26 of the [[United States Code]]).  [[Partnership]]s are "flow-through" entities for [[United States]] federal [[income tax|income taxation]] purposes.  Flow-through taxation means that the entity does not pay taxes on its income. Instead, the owners of the entity pay tax on their "distributive share" of the entity's taxable income, even if no funds are distributed by the partnership to the owners. Federal tax law permits the owners of the entity to agree how the income of the entity will be allocated among them, but requires that this allocation reflect the economic reality of their business arrangement, as tested under complicated rules.

===United Kingdom===

In general, a partnership is treated under Section 111 [[Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]] and Section 848 [[Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005]] as not having a 'separate and distinct' legal personality from its members. As a result, partners are assessed to either [[UK corporation tax]] or [[UK income tax]] on their share of the profits and losses of the partnership

Following the case of Memec plc v CIR [70 TC 77], [[HM Revenue and Customs]] has issued guidance&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/intmanual/INTM180030.htm List of Classifications of Foreign Entities for UK tax purposes]&lt;/ref&gt; as to how interests of UK tax residents in foreign partnerships should be treated for UK tax purposes.

===Hong Kong===
{{Main|Partnership taxation (Hong Kong)}}
Partnership taxation in [[Hong Kong]] is the taxation of the profits or losses generated by [[Partnership (Hong Kong)|partnership business entities]].  First, these profits or losses of the partnership are assessed according to the [http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/112/s22.html Hong Kong Inland Revenue Ordinance, Chapter 112, section 22.]  After assessment, then said profits or losses flow through the partnership to the partners who are then taxed on their share of said profits or losses generated by the partnership without any taxes levied against the partnership.

==Civil law==
Many [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions directly tax the partnership entity.

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Puerto Rico]] on 6 November 1994.&lt;ref name=N1&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', p552 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voters were asked whether they approved of two amendments, one to eliminate the absolute right to [[bail]] and the other to increase the number of [[Supreme Court of Puerto Rico|Supreme Court]] judges. Both were rejected by 54% of voters, with a turnout of 62.2%.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen, p557&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Respect for Marriage Act''', abbreviated as '''RFMA''' ({{USBill|113|H.R.|2523}}, {{USBill|113|S.|1236}}), was a proposed bill in the [[United States Congress]] that would have repealed the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] and required the U.S. federal government to recognize the validity of [[same-sex marriage]]s. It was supported by former U.S. Representative [[Bob Barr]], original sponsor of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA), and former President [[Bill Clinton]], who signed DOMA in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=The Respect for Marriage Act Garners Support of President Clinton and Former Rep. Bob Barr, DOMA's Original Author|url=http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/ny08_nadler/DOMA20090915.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712092758/http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/ny08_nadler/DOMA20090915.html|publisher=United States House of Representatives |date=2009-09-15|archivedate=2011-07-12 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administration of President [[Barack Obama]] also supported RFMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url  = http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/07/19/president-obama-supports-respect-marriage-act|title = President Obama Supports the Respect for Marriage Act|author = Colleen Curtis|date = July 19, 2011 &lt;!-- at 06:43 PM EDT --&gt; |publisher = The White House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been introduced in several previous Congresses, the last version of the proposal was put forth in the [[114th United States Congress|114th Congress]] in both the House and the Senate in January 2015. Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] of [[California]] remarked that this Congress must "ensure that married, same-sex couples are treated equally under federal law".&lt;ref name=blade&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/01/06/respect-marriage-act-reintroduced/#sthash.nnPSdPXd.dpuf|title=Respect for Marriage Act reintroduced|date=January 6, 2015|accessdate=January 6, 2015|first=Chris|last=Johnso|publisher=''[[The Washington Blade]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' that the [[Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] requires all U.S. states to recognize same-sex marriages.&lt;ref name="Obergefell v. Hodges"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Obergefell v. Hodges |vol=576 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=___ |pinpoint=___ |date=2015 |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf |accessdate=27 June 2015 |quote=The Court now holds that same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This decision rendered the last remaining provision of DOMA unenforceable and essentially made the Respect for Marriage act ''de facto'' federal law. The Respect for Marriage Act would now only remove the unenforceable provisions from the statutes.

==Background==
Until 1996, the [[federal government of the United States]] customarily recognized marriages conducted legally in any state for the purpose of federal legislation.&lt;ref name=sue&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124707345336512673|title=Massachusetts Sues U.S. Over Definition of Marriage|date=2009-07-09|accessdate=2009-09-28|publisher=Wall Street Journal|first=Philip|last=Shishkin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following an unsuccessful lawsuit aimed at legalizing [[same-sex marriage]] in Hawaii, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], one section of which forbids the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages.&lt;ref name=sue/&gt;&lt;ref name=ash&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/publications/doma-short-history.pdf|title=A Short History of the Defense of Marriage Act|publisher=[[Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders]]|date=2009-03-03|accessdate=2009-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
A BILL
 
To repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and ensure respect for State regulation of marriage.
 
::''Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled'',
 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
 
This Act may be cited as the "Respect for Marriage Act".

SEC. 2. REPEAL OF SECTION ADDED TO TITLE 28, UNITED STATES CODE, BY SECTION 2 OF THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT.
 
Section 1738C of title 28, United States Code, is repealed, and the table of sections at the beginning of chapter 115 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by striking the item relating to that section.
 
SEC. 3. MARRIAGE RECOGNITION.
 
Section 7 of title 1, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:
:Sec. 7. Marriage
 
:(a) For the purposes of any Federal law in which marital status is a factor, an individual shall be considered married if that individual's marriage is valid in the State where the marriage was entered into or, in the case of a marriage entered into outside any State, if the marriage is valid in the place where entered into and the marriage could have been entered into in a State.

:(b) In this section, the term 'State' means a State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any other territory or possession of the United States.}}

==Choice of law problem==
In addition to repealing DOMA, the legislation would have established a method for the federal government to determine whether a marriage is valid for federal purposes, a legal dilemma known as [[choice of laws]]. Anticipating that federal courts and administrators would need to determine the validity ''for federal purposes'' of a marriage that is recognized in one state and not another, or in a foreign country and not by every U.S. state, it created two tests. If celebrated in a state of the U.S., a marriage is valid for federal purposes if valid in that state. If celebrated elsewhere, a marriage is valid for federal purposes if it is valid in at least one U.S. state.&lt;ref name=baude&gt;William Baude, "Beyond DOMA: Choice of State Law in Federal Statutes," ''Stanford Law Review'', vol. 64, June 2012, 1371-1430, esp. 1401-2, 1417-8, [http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/sites/default/files/Baude-64-Stan-L-Rev-1371.pdf available online], accessed July 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal scholars disputed whether the language of the Respect for Marriage Act was an appropriate solution to the problem. Lynn Wardle wrote that it "is substantively biased to circumvent state policies that do not allow or recognize same-sex marriage" and "a violation of federalism".&lt;ref&gt;Lynn D. Wardle, "Section Three of the Defense of Marriage Act: Deciding, Democracy, and the Constitution," ''Drake Law Review'', 951-1003, esp. 983-4, [http://students.law.drake.edu/lawReview/docs/lrVol58-wardle.pdf available online], accessed July 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; William Baude endorsed the language of the Respect for Marriage Act. He argued that the options are to give priority to the place a marriage is celebrated or to the domicile of the married couple, that one's domicile is more easily manipulated, and that basing the choice of law on the place of celebration "promotes predictability and stability".&lt;ref name=baude /&gt;

==Legislative progress==

===111th Congress===
The 2009 bill was introduced by U.S. Representative [[Jerrold Nadler]] of New York on September 15, 2009, and garnered 120 cosponsors.&lt;ref name=debuts&gt;{{cite news|last=Eleveld|first=Kerry|title=Respect for Marriage Act Debuts|publisher=''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''|date=2009-09-15|url=http://www.advocate.com/Politics/Washington_D_C_/Respect_for_Marriage_Act_Debuts/|accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===112th Congress===
The 2011 bill was introduced by U.S. Representative [[Jerrold Nadler]] of New York on March 16, 2011, and a U.S. Senate version was introduced by [[Dianne Feinstein]] of California on the same day.

===113th Congress===
The bill's sponsors decided not to reintroduce the Respect for Marriage Act in 2013 until the [[United States Supreme Court]] issued a decision in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/05/01/no-doma-repeal-bill-until-after-court-ruling/|last=Johnson|first=Chris|title=No DOMA repeal bill until court decision |publisher=Washington Blade|date=May 1, 2013|accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reintroduced it on June 26, the same day the Court ruled in that case that Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ring |first=Trudy |title=Finishing the Job: DOMA Repeal Bill Reintroduced|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/marriage-equality/2013/06/26/finishing-job-doma-repeal-bill-reintroduced |accessdate=August 17, 2013|newspaper=The Advocate|date=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===114th Congress===
The aforementioned lawmakers Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York and Senator Dianne Feinstein of California reintroduced the legislation on the first day of the [[114th United States Congress|114th Congress]]. Nadler remarked, "We must finish the job begun by the Supreme Court". In terms of co-sponsors, the proposal soon accrued 77 co-sponsors in the House and 41 in the Senate. The news received a warm welcome from [[LGBT rights]] groups such as the [[American Military Partner Association]], which stated that Congressional action had to take place in order to assist same-sex military couples seeking veterans benefits.&lt;ref name=blade/&gt;

Section 2 of DOMA, the last substantive provision of that act remaining viable after ''[[United States v. Windsor|Windsor]]'', was declared unconstitutional in ''[[Obergefell]]'' in June 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8813">'''SEC Rule 10b-5''', codified at {{CodeFedReg|17|240|10b-5}}, is one of the most important rules targeting [[securities fraud]] promulgated by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]], pursuant to its authority granted under § 10(b) of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]].&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|15|78j}}(b)&lt;/ref&gt; The rule prohibits any act or omission resulting in fraud or deceit in connection with the purchase or sale of any [[Security (finance)|security]]. The issue of [[insider trading]] is given further definition in [[SEC Rule 10b5-1]].

== History ==
In 1942, SEC lawyers in the Boston Regional Office learned that a company president was issuing pessimistic statements about company earnings while simultaneously purchasing the company's stock.  Although the [[Securities Act of 1933]] prohibited fraudulent sales of securities, no regulation existed at that time which would have precluded fraudulent purchases.  Rule 10b-5, issued by the SEC under section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, was implemented to fill this regulatory void.  The commissioners approved the rule without debate or comment, with the exception of Commissioner [[Sumner Pike]] who indicated approval of the rule by asking, "Well, we are against fraud aren't we?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=J Robert|url=http://www.theracetothebottom.org/securities-issues/the-unusual-administrative-history-of-rule-10b-5.html|title=The Unusual Administrative History of Rule 10b-5|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language of the rule==
"Rule 10b-5: Employment of Manipulative and Deceptive Practices":

:It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange, 
::(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, 
::(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or 
::(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, 
:in connection with the purchase or sale of any security."

==Elements of the offense==

To establish a claim under Rule 10b-5, plaintiffs (including the SEC) must show (i) Manipulation or Deception (through misrepresentation and/or omission); (ii) Materiality; (iii) "In Connection With" the purchase or sale of securities, and (iv) Scienter.  Private plaintiffs have the additional burden of establishing (v) Standing - Purchaser/Seller Requirement; (vi) Reliance (presumed if there was an omission); (vii) Loss Causation; and (viii) Damages.

These are roughly comparable to the elements of common law fraud, which are i) Deception; ii) Materiality; iii) with Intent to Cause Reliance; that iv) causes Actual Reliance; and v) Harm. 

In a case for [[insider trading]], anyone who uses insider information can be held liable.  A tippee can be liable if the tipper breached a fiduciary duty and the tippee knew or had reason to know that the tipper was breaching the duty.

===Deceit and Reliance===

Deceit can be in the form of an affirmative misrepresentation or of an omission of fact which, in context, makes other facts misleading. 

Furthermore, for a private party to recover damages, they must be able to show that they were injured because they relied on the fraudulent claim.  Alternately, fraud can occur through omission of a material fact, where the injured party does not have to prove reliance, because it is assumed to have occurred.  If the defendant had publicly made a fraudulent statement, ''every'' investor could sue if it could be shown that the statement affected the market as a whole. This is the "fraud on the market" theory the Supreme Court enunciated in ''[[Basic Inc. v. Levinson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Basic Inc. v. Levinson]]'', {{ussc|485|224|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "fraud on the market" presumption of the plaintiff's reliance upon the deceit is only available in situations (like in ''Basic'') where the security is traded on a well organized and presumably efficient market.  The same can be said for an omission of [[material information]].

====Forward Looking Statements====
Both the "bespeaks caution" doctrine and the safe harbor provisions of the [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]] offer protection for forward-looking statements if they are accompanied by cautionary language identifying specific factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement and may be sufficient to absolve a defendant of liability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://definitions.uslegal.com/b/bespeaks-caution-doctrine/ Definition of bespeaks caution doctrine] USLegal.com&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in ''Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System v. MF Global Ltd.,'' the US Second Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a decision by the District Court for the Southern District of New York, ruling that the "bespeaks caution" defense to securities disclosure claims applies exclusively to forward-looking statements and not to characterizations that communicate present or historical fact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.milbank.com/images/content/7/3/731/092210_Iowa_Public_v_MF_Global_Client_Alert.pdf SECOND CIRCUIT CLARIFIES  BESPEAKS-CAUTION DOCTRINE]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materiality===

In the case of ''[[TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc.]]'', {{ussc|426|438|1976}}, 449.&lt;/ref&gt; the word "[[Materiality (law)|material]]" was defined by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] - "an omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote." There are four elements of materiality laid out in TSC: a fact must assume "actual significance" in the deliberations of a "reasonable shareholder" because the fact would have "significantly altered" the "total mix" of information available to that shareholder in making its decisions. Each of those elements is itself the subject of extensive litigation. 

===Scienter===

Negligence is not sufficient for a claim under 10b-5; plaintiffs or prosecutors must show at least recklessness, purpose, or knowledge.

===Standing===

The purchaser/seller requirement is the requirement that, to bring an action under 10b-5, a private plaintiff must be either a buyer or a seller of the company's stock. Potential buyers who were defrauded into not buying stock may not bring a claim under 10b-5. 

===Loss Causation and Damages===

To recover, plaintiffs must be able to show that the fraud proximately caused their losses. Standard damages in fraud cases are [[expectation_damages|expectation]] or benefit of bargain damages. 

==Insider trading==
To what extent Rule 10b-5 prohibits insider trading is a matter of some dispute. The SEC has long advocated an "equal access theory" with regard to 10b-5, arguing that anyone who has material, non-public information must either disclose that information or abstain from trading. However, the Supreme Court rejected the strongest version of that theory in ''[[Chiarella v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chiarella v. United States]]'', {{ussc|445|222|1980}} [https://www.oyez.org/cases/1970-1979/1979/1979_78_1202/]&lt;/ref&gt; holding a person with no fiduciary duty to the shareholders had no duty to disclose information before trading on it. In 1997, the Supreme Court has embraced a "misappropriation" theory of omissions, holding in ''[[United States v. O'Hagan]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. O'Hagan]]'', {{ussc|521|642|1997}} [http://docs.justia.com/cases/supreme/521/642.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; that misappropriating confidential information for securities trading purposes, in breach of a duty owed to the source of that information, gives rise to a duty to disclose or abstain.

==Enforcement==
Both the SEC and private citizens can enforce the requirements of the rule through [[lawsuits]]. In [[Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores]], the Supreme Court held that only purchasers or sellers of securities may bring a private action for damages under Rule 10b-5; however any member of the public may provide information to the SEC regarding possible violations of the federal securities laws.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/complaint/tipscomplaint.shtml SEC tips and complaints]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://denebleo.sec.gov/TCRExternal/index.xhtml SEC "Tips, Complaints and Referrals" website/portal]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Solicitor-General of Australia''' is the country's second highest-ranking law officer, after the [[Attorney-General for Australia]]. The position is often known as the '''Commonwealth Solicitor-General''' in order to distinguish it from the state solicitors-general. The current officeholder is [[Stephen Donaghue]], who took office on 16 January 2017.

The Commonwealth Solicitor-General gives the [[Government of Australia|Australian federal government]] legal advice and appears in court to represent the Commonwealth's interest in important legal proceedings, particularly in the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.directory.gov.au/portfolios/attorney-generals/attorney-generals-department/solicitor-general-0 |title=Solicitor-General |publisher=Australian Government Directory |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the attorney-general, the solicitor-general is not a [[Parliament of Australia|member of parliament]].

==History==
The office was created in 1916 with the appointment of Sir [[Robert Garran]]. Prior to this, from 1903 to 1913 Sir [[Charles Powers]] had served as the first [[Commonwealth Crown Solicitor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography

Two solicitors-general have been appointed to the [[High Court of Australia]]: [[Anthony Mason (judge)|Anthony Mason]] in 1972 and [[Stephen Gageler]] in 2012. Gageler is the only person to be directly elevated from the solicitor-generalship to the High Court.

{{refimprove|date=November 2010}}
A '''Son of Sam law''' is a [[US English]] term for any law designed to keep criminals from profiting from the publicity of their crimes, often by selling their stories to publishers. Such laws often authorize the state to seize money earned from deals such as book/movie biographies and paid interviews and use it to compensate the criminal's victims. These laws have been criticized as violating the free-speech guarantee of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]]. The original and namesake law, from the State of [[New York (state)|New York]], was itself ruled unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], though New York and other states have since passed laws with similar goals that attempt to comply with the Court's decision.

==History and legal status==
The term "Son of Sam" is derived from the first law of this type, targeted at serial killer [[David Berkowitz]], who used the name "Son of Sam" during his notorious murder spree in the mid-1970s [[New York City|New York]]. After his arrest in August 1977, Berkowitz's intense presence in the media led to widespread speculation that he might sell his story to a writer or filmmaker. Although Berkowitz denied wanting any kind of deal, the [[New York State Legislature]] swiftly passed preemptive legal statutes anyway, the first legal restriction of its kind in the U.S. The original New York law was invoked in New York eleven times between 1977 and 1990, including once against [[Mark David Chapman]], the murderer of musician [[John Lennon]]. 

Critics argued that the law infringed on [[Freedom of speech in the United States|freedom of speech]] and therefore violated the First Amendment, and that "Son of Sam" laws take away the financial incentive for many criminals to tell their stories, some of which (such as the [[Watergate scandal]] and the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]]) were of vital interest to the general public.

In 1987, lawyers for publishing company [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] sued the New York authorities to prevent enforcement of the Son of Sam law with respect to a book they were about to publish called ''[[Wiseguy (book)|Wiseguy]]'', written by [[Nicholas Pileggi]]. The book was about ex-mobster [[Henry Hill (mobster)|Henry Hill]] and was used as the basis for the film ''[[Goodfellas]]''. The case reached the federal Supreme Court in 1991. In an 8–0 ruling on ''[[Simon &amp; Schuster v. Crime Victims Board]]'', the court ruled the law unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|502|105|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority opinion was that the law was overinclusive, and would have prevented the publication of such works as ''[[The Autobiography of Malcolm X]]'', [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau's]] ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', and even ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|The Confessions of Saint Augustine]]''.&lt;ref name="NYTsummary"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/11/nyregion/highlights-of-the-ruling-that-struck-down-new-york-s-son-of-sam-law.html?pagewanted=all|title=Highlights of the Ruling That Struck Down New York's 'Son of Sam' Law|date=December 11, 1991|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=August 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the state of [[California]]'s Son of Sam law was struck down in 2002 after being used against [[Barry Keenan]], one of the men who kidnapped [[Frank Sinatra, Jr.]] in 1963.

After numerous revisions, New York adopted a new "Son of Sam" law in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Executive Law § 632-a (McKinney 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; This law requires that victims of crimes be notified whenever a person convicted of a crime receives $10,000 (US) or more—from virtually any source.&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Corrections Law § 500-c (McKinney 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The law then attaches a springing statute of limitations, giving victims an extended period of time to sue the perpetrator of the crime in civil court for their crimes.&lt;ref&gt;See N.Y. C.P.L.R.&lt;/ref&gt; This law also authorizes a state agency, the Crime Victims' Board, to act on the victims' behalf in some limited circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Executive Law § 632-a(2) (McKinney 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus far, the current New York law has survived court scrutiny.

In certain cases, a Son of Sam law can be extended beyond the criminals themselves to include friends, neighbors, and family members of the lawbreaker who seek to profit by telling publishers and filmmakers of their relation to the criminal. In other cases, a person may not financially benefit from the sale of a story or any other mementos pertaining to the crime.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Regardless of whether a state has a formal Son of Sam law, victims and their families may use civil lawsuits for monetary damages that effectively preclude a wrongdoer (or accused wrongdoer) from profiting from his crime. A prominent example is the litigation between the family of [[Ron Goldman]] and [[O. J. Simpson]] following Simpson's [[O. J. Simpson murder case|acquittal for Goldman's murder]]. Goldman's family won a [[wrongful death claim]] against Simpson for more than $30 million. When Simpson later published a book about the murder, ''[[If I Did It]]'', a court awarded the book's rights to the Goldman family to help satisfy the judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dcbar.org/bar-resources/publications/washington-lawyer/articles/may-2011-son-of-sam-laws.cfm|title=Feature: ‘Son of Sam’ Laws: How Much Does Crime Pay?|last=Bordman|first=Ethan|date=May 2011|website=www.dcbar.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In high-profile criminal cases and cases that are closely tied to national security, such as convictions for [[terrorism]] and [[espionage]], a "Son of Sam clause" has been included in [[plea bargain|plea bargains]]. Examples include [[John Walker Lindh]] (an American who aided the [[Taliban]] in [[Afghanistan]]) and [[Harold James Nicholson]] (a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] officer who spied for [[Russia]]). As a result of their plea bargains, any and all profits made from book deals or movie rights would be handed over to the [[U.S. Treasury]]. Neither the convicts nor their families would be able to profit. 

With the advent of the [[Internet]] and online sales, many Son of Sam laws are now targeting the sale of so-called "[[murderabilia]]".{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}  Few courts have yet issued opinions regarding the constitutionality of many of these new laws.

Son of Sam laws are distinct from [[asset forfeiture]], the seizing of assets acquired directly as a result of criminal activity. Where asset forfeiture looks to remove the profitability of crimes by taking away money and assets gained as proceeds from the crime, Son of Sam laws are designed so that criminals are unable to take advantage of the notoriety of their crimes.

In 2007, it was estimated that parrot trappers capture about 65,000–78,500 wild [[parrot]]s each year in [[Mexico]], mainly by setting nets or by collecting [[nestling]]s from tree cavities. About 50,000–60,000, more than 75%, die before reaching customers. Between 2003 and 2006, Mexican wildlife officials did not issue permits for parrot trapping as legal permits provided cover for the illegal trade of poached parrots. Illegal trapping of wild parrots affects most of the 22 parrot species native to Mexico including:&lt;ref name="Cantú2007"&gt;Cantú, J. C. G., Saldaña, M. E. S., Grosselet, M. and Gamez, J. S.

The population of the critically endangered [[Black rhinoceros]], inhabiting most of Sub-Saharan Africa, was estimated to have been about 100,000 in 1960 and has now dramatically decreased to only about 4,000, with poaching being attributed as one of the causes of this decline in population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2011|title=Conservation genetics of the black rhinoceros, Diceros bicornis bicornis, in Namibia|url=|journal=Conserv Genet|volume=12|issue=3|pages=783–792|doi=10.1007/s10592-011-0185-1|last1=Van Coeverden de Groot J|first1=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commercial poaching of [[White rhinoceros|white]] and [[black rhinoceros]] escalated in [[South Africa]] from 12 rhinos killed in 2004 to 946 rhinos killed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Rhino poaching update|date=19 December 2013|publisher=Department of Environmental Affairs|url=https://www.environment.gov.za/mediarelease/update_on_rhino_poaching|accessdate=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ewn.co.za/2013/12/19/946-Rhino-poached-in-2013|title=946 rhino killed in 2013|date=19 December 2013|newspaper=Eyewitness News|accessdate=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhino horns have increasingly been acquired by [[Vietnamese people]].&lt;ref name="Miliken2012"&gt;Milliken, T. and Shaw, J.

'''The Eye that Cries''' (''El Ojo que Llora'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) is a [[memorial]] that was born as a private initiative designed to honor the thousands of victims as a result of terrorism in [[Peru]], to strengthen the collective memory of all Peruvians and to promote peace and reconciliation in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, S. et al ''Final Report for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Peru)'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eye that Cries is part of a larger project called The Memory Alameda which will incorporate other art pieces, large extensions of green areas and the Museum of Memory (Yuyanapaq).

==History==

The memorial, '''The Eye That Cries''', located in [[Campo de Marte]], a park in Jesus Maria, a district of [[Lima, Peru]] was completed in 2005. It was conceptualized and executed by Lika Mutal, an originally [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist who lives and works in both New York and Lima. At the center of the memorial is a black stone which Mutal discovered near a pre-Columbian cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;Vargas Llosa, Mario. "El ojo que llora." El Pais internacional. 14 1 2007: n. page. Web. &lt;http://www.elpais.com/articulo/opinion/ojo/llora/elpepuint/20070114elpepiopi_5/Tes&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The memorial was built primarily as a way to commemorate the roughly 70,000 victims of the violence committed by both the Peruvian military government and the radical guerrilla group attempting to fight against the government and all those who opposed their communist ideologies. The primary guerrilla group was the [[Shining Path]] (Sendero Luminoso in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), a radically communist "terrorist" group who resisted those who opposed them through radical actions, including violence. The government armed forces only added to the violence by fighting the guerrilla group.&lt;ref name="discussion2007"&gt;Milton, C. (2007). Public spaces for the discussion of peru's recent Past/espacios PÚblicos para la DiscusiÓn sobre el pasado reciente de perÚ. Antípoda : Revista De Antropología y Arqueología, (5), 143-168. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/235727692&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the crimes, which took place in a span of twenty years (1980–2000) remained unspoken of until the Peruvian Commission of Truth and Reconciliation (Comisión de Verdad y Reconciliación in Spanish) brought them to the public. After President [[Alberto Fujimori]] fled the country in 2000, human rights committees and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission began the process of reconciling the crimes that had occurred.&lt;ref name="contracorriente2007"&gt;Hite K. ( 2007) The eye that cries: The politics of representing victims in contemporary Peru. Contracorriente 5(1): 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Peru)|The Peruvian Commission of Truth and Reconciliation (CVR)]] filed a public report in 2003 where it spoke of the crimes that occurred during those two decades, and the rulings placed pressure on the Peruvian government to commemorate all of the victims.&lt;ref name="discussion2007"/&gt; The CVR's extensive report stated that during those two decades of violence, 69,280 people had either died or disappeared, roughly 600,000 people became internal refugees, and 40,000 children became orphans.&lt;ref name="discussion2007"/&gt; The truth commission also reported that the majority of the victims of the crimes were indigenous victims who lived in isolated highlands. The report stated that three out of four victims of the brutal crimes were indigenous, roughly 85 percent of all of the victims.&lt;ref name="discussion2007"/&gt; The fact that the indigenous were among one of the most marginalized groups in society and that they lived in highlands away from main cities made it easy for the crimes of the ''Senderos'' and the military officials to go unreported. Their marginalization and their isolation made this highly victimized group silent and they were powerless both against the guerrilla group and the government.&lt;ref name="contracorriente2007"/&gt;

Though the members of the Shining Path contributed to over half of the roughly 70,000 people killed during this twenty-year period, 41 members were still added to the names of the victims in The Eye That Cries memorial. The reason these members were added was due to an armed conflict that occurred in 1992 in Castro Castro prison. Important leaders of the radical guerrilla were captured and imprisoned in Miguel Castro Castro penitentiary. In 1992 in Castro Castro, there was a military raid in which forty-one ''Senderos'' were targeted and killed during the span of four days.&lt;ref name="contracorriente2007"/&gt; The names of those forty-one ''Senderos'' among the victims listed in The Eye That Cries would later cause a controversy since a large portion of the deaths had been at the hands of ''Senderos''. Peruvians considered the Senderos to be terrorists as opposed to victims.

===Fujimori and The role of the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission===

Evidence of Fujimori's corrupt government surfaced and led him to flee to Japan in 2000. Due to the massive amount of corruption during Alberto Fujimori's presidential terms that included blackmail, bribes, and vote-rigging, an investigation into his administration began in 2000 that was led by Alejandro Toledo. The Peruvian government was then urged by human rights organizations to form the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission (CVR) which would investigate the political violence, human rights violations, and government corruption that had afflicted Peru since the 1980s and during Fujimori's presidential terms. When the CVR finished its final report in August 2003, it recommended that to help aid the process of reconciliation, memorials need to be created to pay tribute to the many victims of political violence in Peru. In 2004, Jesus Maria, a district in Lima, was designated as the location for the project Alameda de La Memoria which would give an actual place to the many marginalized voices that were silenced and victimized during the decades of Peruvian conflict. Alameda de la Memoria would provide a space to contemplate and remember, not only for the victims and their families, but also for the Peruvian population. This project would be located in the park Campo de Marte, and would include the memorial The Eye that Cries.

==Controversy==

When Lika Mutal began to work on creating The Eye That Cries, she was given a list of names of individuals who were considered to be victims of violence. This list of names was supplied by the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)|TRC]], and she would later incorporate the nearly 32,000 names into the monument. Unknown to her, the list of names she was given included not only the thousands of victims who were killed during decades of [[Peru|Peru's]] armed conflict, but also the names of 41 victims who were killed in [[National Penitentiary Institute (Peru)|Castro Castro Prison]] during a prison raid in May 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/11/world/americas/11peru.html NY Times Article of Castro Castro Prison Raid]&lt;/ref&gt; The victims killed during the [[National Penitentiary Institute (Peru)|Castro Castro Prison]] raid were "organizers and militants of the Shining Path, Peru's notorious guerrilla movement.&lt;ref&gt;Hite K. ( 2007) The eye that cries: The politics of representing victims in contemporary Peru. Contracorriente 5(1): 110.&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of the Peruvian population views the members of the Shining Path as terrorists responsible for a majority of the deaths of victims of armed conflict in Peru during the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Drinot P. (2009) For whom the eye cries: Memory, monumentality, and the ontologies of violence in Peru. Journal of Latin American Cultural Studies 18(1): 53-59&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of the names of those murdered due to political unrest, guerrilla attacks, and prison raids creates a clash when at times both victims and perpetrators are included side by side and deemed as victims. This conflict leads to the question of what constitutes a victim, who has the right to judge whether an individual is a victim, and whether a criminal can be considered a victim. From the perspective of International Human Rights Laws "those killed extra judicially, including convicted criminals" are considered victims.&lt;ref name="contracorriente2007"/&gt; Yet, from the perspective of a majority of the Peruvian population, the members of [[Shining Path]] were considered to be terrorists responsible for mass murders and destruction.

When Like Mutal completed The Eye That Cries in 2005, it did not create any major controversies, as both the artist, and the Peruvian Population were unaware that the names of 41 Senderistas were included among the 32,000 names of victims written in stones. In November 2006, a ruling by the Inter-American Court on Human Rights based on investigations of the prison raid in Castro Castro and the deaths of the 41 inmates, stated that these deaths were a violation of human rights. After being accused of human rights violations, Peru was instructed to give reparations to the families of the Castro Castro victims and give a public acknowledgment and ceremony that paid honor to the victims and the families of those whose human rights were violated in the Castro Castro raid. In addition, the ruling of the Inter-American Court stated that the names of these victims be included in The Eye that Cries monument within the coming year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corteidh.or.cr/docs/casos/articulos/seriec_162_esp.pdf Inter-American Court Ruling November 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the rulings of the Inter American Court in 2006 became known, the public and the press expressed outrage. Although the prisoners of the Castro Castro prison had indeed suffered human rights violations, they were still deemed "terrorists" by the majority of the Peruvian public and press. The idea that victims and "their perpetrators'" names would be combined under a monument that symbolized reconciliation and a place for family members to mourn their lost ones was one that the Peruvian public was not willing to support. What was ironic though, was that the names of the Castro Castro prison victims had been included in The Eye that Cries since 2005. It took well over one year for the Peruvian press to become aware of this transgression, and it was only because of the ruling of the Inter American Court that the subject itself was brought to light.&lt;ref&gt;Hite K. ( 2007) The eye that cries: The politics of representing victims in contemporary Peru. Contracorriente 5(1): 111-115.&lt;/ref&gt; The differing opinions regarding The Eye that Cries halted the completion of the Memory Alameda, which if realized would have been a three part installation.&lt;ref&gt;Hite K. ( 2007) The eye that cries: The politics of representing victims in contemporary Peru. Contracorriente 5(1): 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vandalism===

In September 2007, [[Alberto Fujimori]] was extradited from [[Chile]] to [[Peru]] where he would stand trial for the violations of human rights and corruption that occurred during his presidential terms. The day after Alberto Fujimori arrived in [[Lima, Peru]], a group of men and women vandalized The Eye that Cries by destroying stones and pouring orange paint on the central stone, and then littering the monument with paint cans. It is believed that the group members responsible for this act of vandalism were supporters of [[Alberto Fujimori|Alberto Fujimori's]] government not only because of the proximity of [[Alberto Fujimori|Fujimori's]] arrival and the attack, but because orange is the color of [[Alberto Fujimori|Fujimori's]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Hite K. ( 2007) The eye that cries: The politics of representing victims in contemporary Peru. Contracorriente 5(1): 132-133.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lika Mutal's Response to Controversy===

In an interview done by ''El Comercio'', Lika Mutal was asked if she would include the names of the 41 victims murdered in the Castro Castro prison raid in her monument. She responded by saying that, "I couldn't. They were criminals, killed outside the rule of law, but criminals nonetheless. If reparations have to be granted to their families, the reparations should be directed to remedy the damage they caused".&lt;ref&gt;''Peru 21,'' 9 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; When it was discovered that the names of terrorists had been included in The Eye that Cries monument, Lika Mutal responded in an interview with ''La Republica'' by saying that she had no knowledge that the names of terrorists were included in the stones. She said that the list given to her by the CVR was marked as the registry that included all of the victims.&lt;ref&gt;''La Republica,'' 18 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist's Inspiration and Description of Monument==

After visiting the Yuyanapaq exhibit, that narrates the more than twenty years of armed conflict in Peru through photographs, Lika Mutal felt inspired. Working primarily with stone, Lika returned to her studio, where she viewed her artistic medium with a new perspective. She says that upon seeing the stone, the phrase "The Eye that Cries" formed in her head. After this moment, she decided to work on this project, and through private sponsors and donations was able to accumulate the necessary funds for The Eye that Cries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agenciaperu.com/cultural/portada/cvr3/mutal.html Lika Mutal Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eye that Cries is located in the middle of a labyrinth. The labyrinth itself is composed of tens of thousands of rocks. Each individual rock is inscribed with a name, age, and year of death of a victim of Peru's decades of internal conflict. The sculpture is representative of Pachamama, which in Quechua means Mother Earth. In the center of the sculpture, a small stone that takes the form of an eye continuously trickles water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interpares.ca/en/photo_essay/9/page3.php Publications and Photo Essays: The Eye that Cries]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social Implications==

For the survivors, family, and friends of the victims of the violent crimes, The Eye That Cries memorial is a place where they are able to mourn the loss of loved ones. This memorial captures all of the loss, and suffering of the people who were affected by the crimes. For the family members whose loved ones were part of the large group of people who disappeared, the memorial is the only place they are able to mourn and remember.&lt;ref name="contracorriente2007"/&gt;

Many mourners come to the memorial and leave flowers next to the stone with the name of their loved one as a way to supplement the fact that their body was never recovered. Having this common, public place to remember has become an important way of keeping the memory alive.&lt;ref name="contracorriente2007"/&gt; The site is a way for Peruvian citizens to attempt to reconcile all the crimes that were committed; along with having a site to mourn their dead, the memorial served as a way to finally publicly display the violent and complicated history of Peru.&lt;ref name="contracorriente2007"/&gt; The memory of the dead and violence that Peru has experienced also serves as a way to strengthen democratic ideologies. The memorial site also has annual events such as a ceremony on [[Day of the Dead|El Dia De Los Muertos]], along with serving as a location of Buddhist prayer ceremonies.&lt;ref name="discussion2007"/&gt; The ruling of the Inter-American court and subsequent controversy has led to an increase in popularity and visits to the memorial site.&lt;ref name="contracorriente2007"/&gt;

The '''Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission''' (TRRC) is a [[truth and reconciliation commission|truth commission]] in [[The Gambia]] to investigate the [[Yahya Jammeh]] era from 1994 to 2017.

Its executive secretary is [[Baba Galleh Jallow (academic)|Baba Galleh Jallow]], its prosecutor is [[Essa M. Faal]], and the chairperson of the 11-strong commission is Lamin J. Sise.

== History ==

=== Establishment ===
The process for founding the TRRC was led by the [[Attorney General of the Gambia|Attorney General]], [[Ba Tambadou]]. At a press conference on 20 July 2017, Tambadou announced that a draft bill for the establishment of the TRRC had been shared with international experts for review. He also announced that a team, led by himself, would begin a public engagement tour on the bill in August, which lasted from 14 to 24 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://foroyaa.gm/draft-bill-on-truth-reconciliation-and-reparations-commission-concluded/|title=Draft bill on truth, reconciliation and reparations commission concluded|last=|first=|date=21 July 2017|work=Foroyaa|access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gainako.com/national-consultation-truth-reconciliation-reparations-commission/|title=National Consultation on the Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission|last=|first=|date=5 August 2017|work=Gainako|access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tambadou then proceeded to table the bill before the National Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mobile.apanews.net/en/news/gambian-mps-adopt-bill-to-probe-jammeh-era-crimes|title=Gambia: MPs adopt bill to probe Jammeh-era crimes|last=|first=|date=14 December 2017|work=APA News|access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 December 2017, the Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission (TRC) Act was passed, and it received presidential assent on 13 January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lawhubgambia.com/truth-reconciliation-reparations-commission/|title=Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission (TRRC) Act|last=|first=|date=|website=Law Hub Gambia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The job description specified that individuals should be of "high moral character and integrity," "no criminal record or involvement in past human rights violations," no political party activity, and residency in either the Greater Banjul Area or in the diaspora.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://freedomnewspaper.com/2018/02/02/gambia-call-nominations-commissioners-truth-reconciliation-reparations-commission/|title=Call for Nominations of Commissioners to the TRRC|last=|first=|date=2 February 2018|work=Freedom Newspaper|access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, Jallow appointed [[Alagie Barrow]] as the director of research and investigation for the commission.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thepoint.gm/africa/gambia/article/trrc-appoints-director-of-research-investigations|title=TRRC appoints director of Research &amp; Investigations|last=|first=|date=10 August 2018|work=The Point|access-date=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced that the commission would begin proceedings on 15 October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.freedomnewspaper.com/2018/08/18/gambia-trrc-update-countdown-to-launching/|title=TRRC Update: Countdown to launching|last=|first=|date=18 August 2018|work=Freedom Newspaper|access-date=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 October, [[Abdoulie Janneh]], who had previously been announced as the chairperson of the commissioners, stepped down from the role due to scheduling conflicts. Lamin J. Sise, a close confidante of the late [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]], was announced to replace him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.freedomnewspaper.com/2018/10/04/gambia-lamin-j-sise-as-chairperson-of-the-truth-reconciliation-and-reparations-commission-of-the-gambia/|title=LAMIN J.

'''William Francis Baxter, Jr.''' (July 13, 1929 – November 27, 1998) was a law professor at [[Stanford University]].  His specialty was [[antitrust law]].

==Antitrust Law==
As [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] in charge of the Antitrust Division of the [[United States Department of Justice]] from 1981–1983,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Weinstein |first=Michael |date=1998-12-02 |title=W. F. Baxter, 69, Ex-Antitrust Chief, Is Dead |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/02/business/w-f-baxter-69-ex-antitrust-chief-is-dead.html?_r=0 |newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2016-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baxter commanded wide public attention when in 1982 he settled a seven-year-old case against [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph|AT&amp;T]] with by far the largest breakup in the history of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], splitting AT&amp;T up into seven [[Regional Bell operating company|regional phone companies]].  On that same day, he dismissed as "without merit" a seemingly endless, thirteen-year-old suit against [[IBM]], which had employed more than 300 lawyers and generated 2,500 depositions and 66 million pages of documents. Additionally, under his leadership, the U.S. Justice Department promulgated revised guidelines that it would use to enforce U.S. antitrust laws going forward.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/2002/01/essential-stability-merger-policy-united-states Remarks of Thomas B. Leary, Former Commissioner, Federal Trade Commission, The Essential Stability of Merger Policy in the United States Prepared Remarks before Guidelines for Merger Remedies: Prospects and Principles, January 17, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of that practice, he is the author of [[Baxter's law|Baxter's Law]] or the Bell Doctrine.

==Animal Rights==
In 1974, Baxter published a widely read and influential book on the law and economics of pollution control entitled ''People or Penguins: The Case for Optimal Pollution''.  This book, though aimed at a law audience, contains a philosophically sophisticated stance on the topic of [[animal rights]].

Baxter maintains that non-human animals have no moral consideration on their own.  Any moral consideration of animals is in relation to humans. Moral consideration is a uniquely ''human'' affair.  This differs from the view that there is no essential difference between the pain of non-human animals and that of human beings (see [[Peter Singer]]), and also differs from the view that the pain of animals is a morally relevant consideration, but is not morally decisive (See [[Bonnie Steinbock]]).

It is important to note that Baxter is not antipathetic toward non-human animals; in fact, he points out that many things that are in the interests of animals (and the larger environment for that matter) are in fact also in the best interests of humans as well.  In this sense we have obligations to how we treat non-human animals, but the grounds is only because of the respective impact on human beings.

Baxter states that the way to measure these humans interests are in terms of a cost benefit analysis, where cost doesn't necessarily mean uniquely monetary costs.
