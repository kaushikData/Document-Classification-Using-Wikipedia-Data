'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Montenegro]], access to information is a right guaranteed by the Constitution and regulated under the law. Montenegro first adopted the Law on Free Access to Information in 2005; in 2013 a new law entered into force, providing a better standard of protection for freedom of information than the previous legal act.&lt;ref name=MANS&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |title=Freedom of information in Montenegro. Analysis of the Legal Framework, Practice and Implementation of ECHR Case Law and other International Standards with Recommendations for Improvement |url=http://www.mans.co.me/en/wp-content/uploads/fai/FreedomOfInformation-Internship.pdf |publisher=MANS. Network for Affirmation of NGO Sector  |issue= |access-date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite some positive developments achieved with the adoption of the new Law, Montenegro still has problems with its implementation.&lt;ref name=BIRN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/montenegro-ngo-doubts-govt-s-plan-to-open-public-records-04-01-2016 |title=Montenegro Plan to Open Public Records Doubted |last= |first= |date=1 April 2016 |website=Balkaninsight.com |publisher= BalkanInsight |access-date=9 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, Montenegro started the process of reforming the current law: a draft proposal was formulated by the Culture of Ministry in 2016 following some pressure from the [[European Union]] to align Montenegrin legislation with EU standards.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

==Legal framework==
The Constitution of Montenegro states, in Article 51, that everyone shall have the right of access to public information held by state authorities and organisations exercising public functions.&lt;ref name=MANS/&gt; Furthermore, the '''2013 Law on Free Access to Information''' establishes a precise procedure for obtaining public information. The law entitles any natural or legal person the right to access information held in any form by state and local authorities, public companies and other entities which exercise public functions. Public authorities have 15 working days for deciding on the disclosure of a required information.&lt;ref name=MANS/&gt;

The new law introduced a new supervisory body, called Agency for the Protection of Personal Data and Free Access to Information which works on the appeal process of freedom of information requests.&lt;ref name=MANS/&gt; Another positive development in the 2013 law is the introduction of fines to be imposed upon public bodies which fail to fulfill with their duties with regard to access to information.&lt;ref name=MANS/&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==
According to the 2016 [[European Commission]] Progress Report on Montenegro, the law on Access to public information lack effective monitoring and supervision.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt; According to the newspaper [[Vijesti]], the experience of journalists and NGOs in the country shows that, despite FOI legal provisions, in practice it is difficult to get information of public importance. &lt;ref name=OBCT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Montenegro/Montenegro-i-silenzi-della-pubblica-amministrazione-177586 |title=Montenegro: i silenzi della pubblica amministrazione |last=Čađenović |first=Ivan |date=10 February 2017 |website=balcanicaucaso.org |publisher=Osservatorio Balcani Caucasto Transeuropa / Vijesti |access-date=21 February 2017 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last years the proportion of requests refused by public authorities in Montenegro improved from 24% in 2014 to 18% in 2015. Also, the 2016 budget of the Agency for the Protection of Personal Data and Access to Information was increased by 50%.&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |title=Montenegro 2016 Report |url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/pdf/key_documents/2016/20161109_report_montenegro.pdf  |publisher=European Commission |access-date=9 February  2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limited capacity and resources of the Agency was an issue of concern for some NGOs advocating for access to information.&lt;ref name="MANS" /&gt;

In 2015, out of a total of 4.434 requests for access to information, the information requested was not provided in 805 cases.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt; The Agency for Personal Data Protection and Free Access to Information received a total of 1.431 complaints in 2015. The majority of cases received by the Agency concerned [[administrative silence]]: in these cases the request remained unanswered.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt;

The majority of FOI requests, around 70%, are filed by NGOs, among which stands the NGO MANS.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt; This data shows the low awareness and knowledge by the general public of the right of access to information and its legal provisions.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt; In the majority of cases applicants are get the required information with large delays, beyond the time frame established by the law, and often after having filed a complaint to the Ombudsbam.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt;

Another issue of concern is that court decisions on cases concerning access to information are not effectively enforced.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt; The report of the EC also points out that in some cases public authorities in Montenegro seem to abuse the possibility of declaring requested documents confidential in order to avoid their disclosure.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt; Indeed, according to the NGO MANS, the law includes a series of unnecessary reasons for exceptions for limiting disclosure. The formulation of the exceptions enshrined in the law seems to be too vague and too general, thus giving room for public institutions to interpret it in a way that restricts access to information.&lt;ref name="MANS" /&gt;

Another reason of concern is the high percentage of requests that remain unanswered.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;

According to the [[Balkan Insight|Balkan Investigative Reporting Network]] (BIRN), problems in realizing the right of access to public information arise in particular when journalists and NGOs seek information about the privatization process or seek information that could potentially reveal cases of corruption or illegal activity. &lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; &lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2015 |title=Montenegro 2015 Human Rights Report. Executive Summary |url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/253093.pdf |publisher=US State Department|access-date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the NGO MANS, the respect of the law on access to public information is particularly problematic when it comes to make public information concerning enterprises where the State owns the majority of shares.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt;

The EC Progress Report recommends to enhance the implementation of the law especially in corruption-prone cases.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;

'''Beverage Partners Worldwide''' (BPW) is a [[joint venture]] between [[The Coca-Cola Company]] and [[Nestlé]] with headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. BPW is in the [[ready-to-drink]] tea category in the [[beverage industry]].

The company manages the NESTEA business in 52 countries, collaborating with Coca-Cola bottling partners, who are responsible for production and distribution across its markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.just-drinks.com/news/coca-cola-co-nestle-scale-back-joint-venture_id105953.aspx Coca-Cola Co and Nestlé Scale Back Joint Venture] Just-Drinks.com, retrieved 6 Jan 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
BPW began in 1991 as Coca-Cola Nestlé Refreshments Company S.A., created to develop the business of ready-to-drink coffee, chocolate and tea around the world. The Coca-Cola Company and Nestlé S.A. are equal partners in the joint venture.  In 2001, a unit of the venture was renamed as Beverage Partners Worldwide (BPW)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB980826756503480975 "Coca-Cola Venture With Nestle Will Expand to New Markets"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', January 30, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007 was restructured to focus on developing and marketing ready-to-drink tea, in particular NESTEA. In 2012, it was decided to concentrate the operations of the joint venture within Eastern and Western Europe, Canada, Australia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.  News reports indicated that both parties were dissatisfied with the performance of the joint venture.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Rappeport, [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b1d22234-38af-11e1-9d07-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3YkwBbB00 "Coke and Nestlé end parts of iced tea venture"], ''[[Financial Times]]'', January 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Board of Education of [[Kiryas Joel]] Village School District v. Grumet''''', 512 U.S. 687 (1994),{{ref|citation}} was a case in which the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled on the constitutionality of a school district created with boundaries that matched that of a religious community.

==Opinion of the court==
The court, in an opinion by [[Justice Souter]], held that the creation of a school district unit of government designed to coincide with the neighborhood boundaries of a religious group constitutes an unconstitutional aid to religion. Souter concluded that "government should not prefer one religion to another, or religion to irreligion." "There is more than a fine line between the voluntary association that leads to a political community comprising people who share a common religious faith, and the forced separation that occurs when the government draws explicit political boundaries on the basis of peoples'
faith. In creating the district in question, New York crossed that line."

==Dissent==
[[Justice Scalia]], in his dissent, acknowledged that the residents of this district are [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar Hasidic Jews]], but noted of the Satmar community:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[A]ll its residents also wear unusual dress, have unusual civic customs, and have not much to do with people who are culturally different from them ... On what basis does Justice Souter conclude that it is the theological distinctiveness rather than the cultural distinctiveness that was the basis for New York State's decision? The normal assumption would be that it was the latter, since it was not theology but dress, language, and cultural alienation that posed the educational problem for the children.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scalia argued that the Satmar school district aided the Satmars as a [[culture]] rather than a religion, and thus did not constitute impermissible aid to a religious group.  The majority, Scalia asserted, would "laud this humanitarian legislation if all of the distinctiveness of the students of Kiryas Joel were attributable to the fact that their parents were nonreligious commune dwellers, or American Indians, or Gypsies," and concluded that "creation of a special, one-culture school district for the benefit of those children would pose no problem. The neutrality demanded by the Religion Clauses requires the same indulgence towards cultural characteristics that are accompanied by religious belief."

'''Conservatorship''' is a legal concept in the [[United States]]. A guardian or a protector is appointed by a judge to manage the financial affairs and/or daily life of another due to physical or mental limitations, or old age.&lt;ref name="al"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is a Conservatorship|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/estate_planning/conservatorship.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=20 December 2017|date=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person under conservatorship is a "conservatee," a term that can refer to an adult. A person under guardianship is a "ward," a term that can also refer to a minor child.

The '''conservator''' may be only of the "estate" (financial affairs), but may be also of the "person," wherein the conservator takes charge of overseeing the daily activities, such as health care or living arrangements of the '''conservatee'''. A conservator of the person is more typically called a [[legal guardian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lawbytes|url=http://www.selegal.org/conservatorships.htm|website=Southeast Tennessee Legal Services|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appointment==
Conservatorship is established either by [[court order]] (with regard to individuals) or via a statutory or regulatory authority (with regard to organizations such as business entities). In other legal terms, a conservatorship may refer to the legal responsibilities over a person who is [[mentally disordered]], including individuals who are [[psychotic]], [[suicidal]], demented, incapacitated, or in some other way unable to make legal, medical or financial decisions on behalf of themselves.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Baxter |first=Lawrence |last2=Brown |first2=Bill |last3=Cox |first3=Jim |title=Finally, A Bridge to Somewhere |newspaper=Huffington Post |date=February 27, 2009 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lawrence-baxter-bill-brown-and-james-cox/finally-a-bridge-to-somew_b_170688.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to government control of private corporations such as [[Freddie Mac]] or [[Fannie Mae]], conservatorship implies a more temporary control than does [[nationalization]].

==Conservatorship of persons==
Conservatorship is a legal term referring to the legal responsibilities of a conservator over the affairs of a person who has been deemed [[gravely disabled]] by the court and unable to meet his or her basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter. They are governed by the state's individual laws. Terminology varies, and some states or jurisdictions may refer to a conservator as a guardian of the estate or as a trustee.

Conservatorships are generally put in place for severely mentally ill individuals who are gravely disabled, elderly individuals with dementia or Alzheimer's disease who lack mental capacity, or individuals with developmental disabilities who may or may not lack mental capacity. Mental capacity normally must to be evaluated by a medical physician or a psychiatrist experienced in the field and is documented and provided to the court as evidence.&lt;ref name="al"/&gt;

In the state of California there are two types of conservatorships: Lanterman–Petris–Short ([[Lanterman–Petris–Short Act]] of 1967, referred to as LPS) and Probate conservatorships.  These forms of conservatorship are governed by the California Probate Code, and Welfare and Institutions Codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How are Lanterman-Petris-Short (LPS) and Probate conservatorships different?|url=http://www.lacourt.org/division/probate/PR0019.aspx|website=Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limited conservatorship===
A "limited conservatorship" usually refers to the limited legal responsibilities of a conservator over the affairs of an individual who is developmentally disabled, but still capable of making important decisions for himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Limited Conservatorship|url=http://www.scscourt.org/self_help/probate/conservatorship/conservatorship_limited.shtml|website=Superior Court of California, County of Alameda|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these cases, the conservatee to whom the limited conservatorship applies can retain more control over his or her personal affairs than other conservatees can; for example, he or she may retain his or her right to decide where he or she may live.

An example of a conservator's duties includes: locating and marshalling assets, such as property and money, which belong to the conservatee; using the assets to buy food for the conservatee, secure and pay for placement in a facility which would take care of the conservatee or treat a mental illness, pay bills for the conservatee, manage property by paying for property insurance, mortgage payments or rent, property clean-up, or pay for a property management company to rent the property. An example of a conservator or guardian's medical responsibilities would be the court granting medical authority to the conservator or guardian, and the conservator or guardian authorizing a physician to place a feeding tube to provide nourishment into the protected person's stomach if they are in medical need of it.  It is not uncommon for one person to hold both offices and be referred to as the "guardian and conservator" of the conservatee, even though a conservator or guardian can be appointed over the person only, the estate only, or both. Generally, a conservator or guardian over the estate is only appointed if the conservatee has assets that need to be protected, marshalled, and managed. These terms may be found in use in U.P.C. jurisdictions, even though the U.P.C. uses the term "protected person" in either case.

In most states, an outside party or agency must review the facts of the case and submit a report, usually required to be in writing, to the court before the court makes a decision on the request to establish a conservatorship or guardianship. Usually the outside party is a local County Mental Health representative called an investigator. They are often required to be experts in some appropriate field, such as social work, mental health, a medical field, or law. Procedures for conservatorship of an adult are often different from those for minors. 

The court may appoint an attorney to represent the proposed conservatee or ward. If the proposed conservatee or ward is unable to have an attorney-client relationship because of some impairment, the court may appoint a guardian-ad-litem (who is often also an attorney). A guardian-ad-litem does not take instruction from the client, but rather acts on their behalf and tells the court what they think is in the best interests of the proposed conservatee or ward, whether or not that is what the proposed conservatee or ward wants. The conservatee has the right to be represented by an attorney, and if they cannot afford a private attorney, they are appointed a public defender that will represent them free of cost.

====California====
LPS conservatorships begin with a temporary 30-day conservatorship, and if the conservatee remains gravely disabled, the conservator is reappointed for a year; the LPS conservatorship can be renewed annually, or terminated if no longer needed. Probate conservatorships are referred to as "general conservatorships", and typically do not have a temporary period unless an urgent emergency exists that is creating risk to the person or their estate. Probate conservatorship do not automatically expire as LPS conservatorships do if they are not renewed by the conservator.

In an LPS conservatorship, a court-appointed conservator over the person is responsible for managing the conservatee's placement, medical decisions, and mental health treatment. A conservator over the estate is responsible for marshalling, protecting, and managing the conservatee's assets that remain in their estate. A conservator reports to the court that appointed them, and is monitored by the supervising judicial court in the county in which the conservatee permanently resides.

LPS conservatorships usually begin in the County Mental Health system and are referred from acute psychiatric hospitals, where Probate conservatorships can result from any referral source if validated with property medical documentation. Mental Health consumers have the right to a Patient's Rights advocate, and are taken through a series of hearings while they are in the acute hospital before they reach the point of needing a conservator.

==Conservatorship of organizations==
{{expert needed|Business|section|ex2=Law|date=February 2009}}
In the United States, in some states, corporations can be placed under conservatorship, as a less extreme alternative to [[receivership]].  Whereas a receiver is expected to terminate the rights of shareholders and managers, a conservator is expected merely to assume those rights,  with the prospect that they will be relinquished.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=Preventing Financial Chaos: An International Guide to Legal Rules and Operating Procedures for Handling Insolvent Banks |isbn=90-411-8848-7 |page=32 |first=Robert Lee |last=Ramsey |author2=John W. Head |year=2000 |publisher=[[Kluwer]] |location=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Robert Ramsey &amp; John Head, law professors who specialize in financial issues, suggest that an [[insolvent]] bank should go into receivership rather than conservatorship to guard against false hope and [[moral hazard]].&lt;ref&gt;
Ramsey &amp; Head (2000), p.37
&lt;/ref&gt;

At the federal government level in the United States, in July 2008, the failing [[IndyMac Bank]] was taken into [[administrative receivership]] by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) and its assets and secured liabilities transferred to a specially established [[Bridge bank (United States)|bridge bank]] called [[IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB]] which was placed into conservatorship, also by the FDIC.

Again, in the U.S. at the federal level, in September 2008, the chief executive officers, and board of directors [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] were dismissed,  and the companies were placed into the conservatorship of the [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]] (FHFA) via the determination of its director [[James B. Lockhart III]], with the support and financial backing of U.S. Treasury via Treasury secretary [[Hank Paulson]]'s commitment to keep the corporations solvent.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The intervention leading to the conservatorship of these two entities has become the largest in government history, and was justified as necessary step to prevent the damage to the financial system that would have been caused by their failure. Entities like this are considered [[too big to fail]].&lt;ref name='Treasury-Paulson-2008-09-07'&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

An even more ambitious use of the conservatorship model has been proposed by Duke professors Lawrence Baxter, Bill Brown and Jim Cox.  They suggest that the troubled U.S. banks be placed in conservatorship, that some of their "good assets" be dropped into newly created "good bank" subsidiaries (presumably under new management), and the remaining "bad assets" be left to be managed under the supervision of a conservatorship structure.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1472">'''Cookeen''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] brand of block [[Shortening|vegetable fat]], marketed for use in making [[pastry]], and other baked goods.  It is claimed to be usable straight from the [[refrigerator]].

It is sold by [[Princes (company)|Princes Limited]], a British food producer owned by [[Mitsubishi]]. The brand is owned by '''Edible Oils Limited''', a joint venture between [[Archer Daniels Midland]] (ADM), an American food processing corporation, and Princes.  The product is produced at a factory in [[Erith]], England.

In October 2006, Cookeen and the other hard vegetable fats manufactured by Edible Oils Limited were reformulated to remove hydrogenated vegetable oils, which contain [[trans fat]], due to health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home baking brands remove hydrogenated vegetable oil|url=http://www.princesgroup.com/news/home-baking-brands-remove-hydrogenated-vegetable-oil/|accessdate=19 November 2013|date=1 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular Culture==

[[Matt Lucas]] used the line "Give 'em a little lift with cookeen." in a parody song for his character [[George Dawes]] on the [[British comedy]] [[panel show]] ''[[Shooting Stars (TV series)|Shooting Stars]]''.

|quote = On the south side [of Statue Square] stands the New Law Courts. It was designed in England, and the only feature of note is the inartistic roof. Like all buildings erected by the Government, the edifice has been in course of construction nearly 15 years, and is still not completed. All the granite used in the construction of this massive block of buildings is the product of the Island and the mainland.

[[File:Legislative Council building.JPG|thumb|[[Architecture of Ancient Greece|Classical architecture]] was used in the design of the Building.]]
The '''Court of Final Appeal Building''' ({{zh|t=終審法院大樓}}), also known as the '''Old Supreme Court Building''' ({{zh|t=舊最高法院大樓| labels=no}}), is the home of the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]] of [[Hong Kong]]. It housed the former [[Supreme Court (Hong Kong)|Supreme Court]] from 1912 to 1983 and the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] from 1985 to 2011. It is located at 8 Jackson Road, in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]],&lt;ref name="Information note"/&gt; along the eastern side of [[Statue Square]], directly west of [[Chater Garden]]. As the Old Supreme Court, its exterior is one of the [[declared monuments of Hong Kong]].
{{TOC limit|2}}
==History==
The building was designed by Sir [[Aston Webb]] and [[Ingress Bell]],&lt;ref name="LegCo Building"/&gt; the British architects responsible for the eastern façade of [[Buckingham Palace]]&lt;ref name="Information note"/&gt; and the Cromwell Road frontage of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.

Construction of the Building started in 1900 and it was opened on 15 January 1912 by the Governor Sir [[Frederick Lugard]].&lt;ref name="Information note"/&gt; The two-storey [[granite]] building is [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] in style supported by [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns. It is surmounted by a 2.7 m high blind-folded statue of Justice, represented by [[Themis]], the Greek Goddess of Justice and Law.&lt;ref name="LegCo Building"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legco.gov.hk/young/english/building/legco_building_1.html|title= The Legislative Council Building|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= Legislative Council|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123062416/http://www.legco.gov.hk/young/english/building/legco_building_1.html|archivedate=23 November 2011 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statue is inspired by the one erected on the [[the Old Bailey|Old Bailey]] of London.

During the [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong]] (December
1941 to August 1945), the building was used as the headquarters of the ''[[Kempeitai]]'' (Military Police).&lt;ref name="Information note"&gt;Legislative Council Secretariat: [http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr02-03/english/sec/library/0203in26e.pdf Information note IN26/02-03: The Legislative Council Building]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, this building was severely affected by the construction of [[MTR]]; therefore, it had to undergo some restoration afterwards.&lt;ref name="LegCo Building"/&gt; As a consequence, for a time in the early 1980s, the Supreme Court was moved to the [[Former French Mission Building]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Roberts|first= Denys |authorlink=Denys Roberts|date=Apr 18, 2006 |title= Another Disaster: Hong Kong Sketches|url= |location= |publisher= The Radcliffe Press|pages= 87–88|isbn= 9781845111120|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was then used by the [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria]] [[District Court (Hong Kong)|District Court]].

The building became the Legislative Council Building in 1985, and the Supreme Court was moved to the [[High Court Building (Hong Kong)|Supreme Court Building]] in [[Admiralty, Hong Kong|Admiralty]] and was renamed the [[High Court Building (Hong Kong)|High Court Building]] in 1997.

In 2011 the Legislative Council was moved to the [[Legislative Council Complex]] within the [[Central Government Complex]] at [[Tamar site]].

On 7 September 2015,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hongkongfp.com/2015/09/07/court-of-final-appeal-moves-into-former-legislative-council-building/&lt;/ref&gt; the building reverted to its former judicial function. It is now housing the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]]. The opening ceremony was held on 25 September 2015 by the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal [[Geoffrey Ma Tao-li]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalpost.com/article/6656687/2015/09/25/hong-kongs-court-final-appeal-building-opens&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural features==
The building was erected on [[Land reclamation in Hong Kong|reclaimed land]]. Its [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] was formed by driving hundreds of [[Cunninghamia|Chinese fir]] tree trunks into the mixture of reclamation materials and [[silt]] on the site. As a consequence, the Building is in effect "floating" on a timber raft. Such a foundation system requires the [[groundwater]] level to be maintained at a constant level, and a groundwater replenishment system is installed to replace groundwater as required.&lt;ref name="Information note"/&gt;

The plan of the building follows a rectangular pattern and is symmetrical. The Building occupies an area of around {{convert|2660|m2}} (about {{convert|70|x|38|m}}) and is surrounded by columns. The height of the building, from street level to the highest point, which is in the form of a bronze [[Tudor Crown]], is about {{convert|40|m}}.&lt;ref name="Information note"/&gt;

[[File:HK Central Statue Square Legislative Council Building n Themis n Lions n Dieu et mon droit.JPG|thumb|150px|Themis and the royal coat of arms]]
A pediment surmounts the central section of the building facing Statue Square. The pediment is topped by a [[Themis|Statue of Justice]] and under it is the inscription "Erected AD MDCCCCX" (Erected AD 1910). The pediment incorporates a semi-circular window and the carving of the [[British Royal Coat of Arms]] is above it. The shield shows the various royal emblems of the various parts of the United Kingdom: [[Royal Arms of England|the three lions of England]] in the first and fourth quarters, [[Royal Arms of Scotland|the lion of Scotland]] in the second and [[Coat of arms of Ireland|the harp of Ireland]] in the third. The shield is supported by [[The Lion and the Unicorn |the English lion and Scottish unicorn]] and is surmounted by the royal crown. The motto of the sovereign, ''[[Dieu et mon droit]]'' (God and my right), is displayed underneath it. The figures of Mercy and Truth are located on both sides of the British Royal Arms.&lt;ref name="Information note"/&gt;

The '''Energy Act 2010''' is an [[Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] pertaining to the regulation of energy usage and markets, with amendments to similar pieces of previous legislation. The Act was granted [[Royal Assent]] on 8 April 2010 along with a series of other bills during the [[wash-up period]] prior to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]].

==History==

===House of Commons===
Introduced by [[Ed Miliband]] MP, the then-[[Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change]], the Energy Bill had its first reading on 19 November 2009.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;[http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2009-10/energy/stages.html Bill stages - Energy Bill 2009-10] ''UK Parliament'' Retrieved 17 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 December of the same year, the Bill received its second reading and first debate,&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; during which the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] agreed on the continuation of the Energy Bill to become law, while facing opposition from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. While Miliband received questions over grid access, gas storage, and the Government's support of the European "super-grid," the Bill was passed to the committee stage.&lt;ref name="7 dec hansard"&gt;{{cite web|author=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons, Westminster |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091207/debtext/91207-0007.htm |title=House of Commons Hansard for 7 December 2009 |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=7 December 2009 |accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
The Energy Act 2010 is subdivided into four parts: carbon capture storage and regulation, schemes for reducing fuel poverty, regulations of gas and electricity markets, and final provisions.&lt;ref name="contents"&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2010/ukpga_20100027_en_1 Energy Act 2010: Contents] ''Office of Public Sector Information'' Retrieved 13 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these parts contains a number of sections and clauses, with a total of 39 sections throughout the act.

===Carbon capture energy and storage===
Part one of the Act details the powers of the [[Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change]] to provide funding for carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects, at the same time being allowed to withhold or cease funding CCS demonstrations.&lt;ref name="p1"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/27/contents#pt1 Energy Act 2010: Part 1] ''Office of Public Sector Information'' Retrieved 13 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; There are also provisions for the Secretary of State to impose a "supply levy" upon those who use supplies of electricity. Further, section five requires that the Secretary of State provide a report every three years on the state of both decarbonising electricity and the development of new carbon capturing technologies.&lt;ref name="p1"/&gt;

A '''referendum on reforming the voting system''' was held in the [[Falkland Islands]] on 3 November 2011.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=fk012011 Falkland-Inseln, 3. November 2011 : Wahl in einem einzigen Wahlkreis] Direct Democracy&lt;/ref&gt; Voters were asked "Do you want a single constituency for the whole of the Islands?"&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; The proposal required a two-third majority in both of the islands' constituencies,&lt;ref name=MP/&gt; but was rejected by 58.78% of voters overall; in [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] it was narrowly approved by 50.2% of voters but in [[Camp (Falkland Islands)|Camp]] it was widely rejected, with 84% voting against.&lt;ref name=MP&gt;[http://en.mercopress.com/2011/11/04/falkland-islands-voters-overwhelmingly-reject-single-constituency-proposal Falkland Islands voters overwhelmingly reject single constituency proposal] MercoPress, 4 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Turnout was 70% in Camp and just 39% in Stanley.&lt;ref name=MP/&gt;

==Background==
Under section 27 of the [[Falkland Islands Constitution]], any change to the constituencies on the islands must be supported in a referendum by at least two-thirds of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.falklands.gov.fk/assembly/documents/The%20Falkland%20Islands%20Constitution%20Order%202008.pdf#page=22 |title=Official text of the Falkland Islands Constitution Order 2008 |author= |date=1 January 2009 |work= |publisher=falklands.gov.fk |accessdate=2010-06-07 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123063145/http://www.falklands.gov.fk/assembly/documents/The%20Falkland%20Islands%20Constitution%20Order%202008.pdf#page=22 |archivedate=2009-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal to create a single constituency for the islands was a response to [[Camp (constituency)|Camp]] being heavily over-represented in the [[Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands|Legislative Assembly]], electing three of the eight seats (38% of the total), whilst the remaining five seats were elected from [[Stanley (constituency)|Stanley]] (62.5%).&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; In 2011 there were 262 voters (17%) in Camp and 1,315 (83%) in Stanley, meaning the current arrangements provided for one MLA for every 87 voters in Camp and one for every 263 in Stanley.&lt;ref name=211-11P&gt;[http://www.falklands.gov.fk/assembly/documents/211-11P.pdf Voting arrangements for Referendum of 3 November 2011] Government of the Falkland Islands&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally the two constituencies had had equal representation, but had been changed as the population of Stanley increased.&lt;ref name=MP/&gt; The proposal had already been put to voters in [[Falkland Islands general election, 2001#Referendum results|a referendum]] in 2001, and had been rejected.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; A second referendum was approved by the Assembly on 26 August 2011 by a vote of four to three.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

==Results==
The question posed by the referendum was:

'''Giovanni Segantini''' (15 January 1858 – 28 September 1899) was an Italian [[Painting|painter]] known for his large pastoral landscapes of the [[Alps]]. He was one of the most famous artists in Europe in the late 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;Rapetti, p236&lt;/ref&gt; and his paintings were collected by major museums. In later life, he combined a [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] painting style with [[Symbolist]] images of nature. He was active in [[Switzerland]] during the last period of his life.

==Biography==
Giovanni Battista Emanuele Maria Segatini [''sic''] was born at [[Arco, Trentino|Arco]] in [[Trentino]], which was then part of the [[County of Tyrol]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. He later changed his family name by adding another "n" after the "a".&lt;ref&gt;Stutzer, p13&lt;/ref&gt; He was the second child of Agostino Segatini (1802–1866) and Margherita de Giradi (1828–1865). His older brother, Lodovico, died in a fire the year Giovanni was born. During the first seven years of his life, his father, who was a tradesman, traveled extensively while looking for work. Except for a six-month period in 1864 when Agostino returned to Trentino, Segantini spent his early years with his mother, who experienced severe depression due to the death of Lodovico.&lt;ref&gt;Bachmann, p16&lt;/ref&gt; These years were marked by poverty, hunger and limited education due to his mother's inability to cope.

In the spring of 1865, his mother died after spending the past seven years in increasingly poor health. His father left Giovanni under the care of Irene, his second child from a previous marriage, and again traveled in search of work. He died a year later without returning home and leaving his family nothing. Without money from her father, Irene lived in extreme poverty. She was forced to spend most of her time working menial jobs while leaving Giovanni to subsist on his own.

Irene hoped to improve her life by moving to Milan, and in late 1865 she submitted an application to relinquish Austrian citizenship for both her brother and her. She either misunderstood the process or simply did not have enough time to follow through, and although their Austrian citizenship was revoked she neglected to apply for Italian citizenship. As a result, both Segantini and his sister remained [[statelessness|stateless]] for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Stutzer, p13&lt;/ref&gt; After he became famous Switzerland offered him citizenship on more than one occasion, but he refused in spite of many hardships, saying Italy was his true homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Bachmann, p144&lt;/ref&gt; After his death the Swiss government successfully awarded him citizenship.

At age seven, Segantini ran away and was later found living on the streets of [[Milan]]. The police committed him to the Marchiondi Reformatory, where he learned basic cobbling skills but little else. For much of his early life, he could barely read or write; he finally learned both skills when he was in his mid-30s. Fortunately, a chaplain at the reformatory noticed that he could draw quite well, and he encouraged this talent in an attempt to lift his self-esteem.

In 1873, Segantini's half-brother Napoleon claimed him from the reformatory, and for the next year Segantini lived with Napoleon in Trentino. Napoleon ran a photography studio, and Segantini learned the basics of this relatively new art form while working there with his half-brother. He would later use photography to record scenes that he incorporated into his painting.&lt;ref&gt;Bachmann, p22&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Segantini returned to Milan and attended classes at the [[Brera Academy]]. While there, he became friends with members from a transformative movement known as [[Scapigliatura]] (the "Disheveleds"), which included artists, poets, writers and musicians who sought to erase the differences between art and life. Among his closest friends at the time were [[Carlo Bugatti]] and [[Emilio Longoni]], both of whom profoundly influenced his work and his interests.&lt;ref&gt;Bachmann, p197&lt;/ref&gt;

His first major painting, ''The Chancel of Sant Antonio'' (Il Coro di Sant'Antonio), was noticed for its powerful quality, and in 1879 it was acquired by Milan's Società per le Belle Arti. That work attracted the attention of painter and gallery owner [[Vittore Grubicy de Dragon]], who became his advisor, dealer and his life-long financial supporter. Grubicy and his brother, Alberto, who was a co-owner of the gallery, introduced Segantini to the works of [[Anton Mauve]] and [[Jean-François Millet]]. Both of these artists influenced Segantini's work for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Fraquelli, p22&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, he met Bugatti's sister, Luigia Pierina Bugatti (1862–1938), known as "Bice", and they began a life-long romance. Although Segantini tried to marry Bice the next year, due to his stateless status he could not be granted the proper legal papers. In opposition to this bureaucratic technicality, they decided to live together as an unmarried couple. This arrangement led to frequent conflicts with the Catholic church that dominated the region at this time, and they were forced to relocate every few years to avoid local condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;Fraquelli, p24&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of these difficulties, Segantini was thoroughly devoted to Bice throughout his life. He wrote many love letters when he was away from her, sometimes including wild flowers that he had picked. Once he wrote, "Take these unsightly flowers, these violets, as a symbol of my great love, When a spring comes in which I fail to send you such violets, you will no longer find me among the living."&lt;ref&gt;Heslewood, p53&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, he and Bice moved to [[Pusiano]] and soon thereafter to the village of Carella, where they shared a house with their friend Longoni.&lt;ref&gt;Fraquelli, p163&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this mountain scenery that Segantini began to paint [[en plein air]], preferring to work in the outdoors than in a studio. While he worked outside, Bice would read to him, and eventually he learned to read and write. Later he would write articles for Italian art magazines, and he was a prolific letter writer to Bice when he traveled and to other artists throughout Europe.

At this time, he painted the first version of ''Ave Maria'' (Segantini Museum, [[St. Moritz]]), which took a gold medal at the [[Internationale Koloniale en Uitvoerhandel Tentoonstelling|1883 World's Fair]] in [[Amsterdam]]. As his fame rose, Segantini entered into a formal agreement with the Grubicys to be the sole representatives of his work. While this allowed Segantini more freedom to pursue his artistry, the dealers were consistently slow in fulfilling their financial obligations to the artists. The family struggled for many years in relative poverty, even as Bice gave birth to four children: Gottardo (1882–1974 ), Alberto (1883–1904), Mario (1885–1916) and Bianca (1886–1980). To help Bice care for his family, Segantini employed a young maid, Barbara "Baba" Uffer, who also became his favorite model for his paintings. Baba stayed with the family throughout their periods of penury and many households, but unlike many artist/model relationships of the time there is no evidence that they had any romantic involvement.&lt;ref&gt;Bachmann, p27&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period Segantini produced several important paintings using Baba as a model, including ''Mothers'', ''After a Storm in the Alps'', ''A Kiss'' and ''Moonlight Effect'' (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Rouen).

In 1886, Segantini sought a less expensive place to live and, attracted by the beautiful mountain scenery, he moved his family to [[Savognin]], [[Graubünden]]. From November, 1886, to March, 1887, Grubicy stayed with the Segantinis in their new home. Excited by the recent work of Mauve and others, Grubicy suggested that Segantini further separate his colors in order to increase their brilliance.&lt;ref&gt;Fraquelli, p14&lt;/ref&gt; The artist applied this advice to a second version of ''Ave Maria'', in which he used the [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] painting technique for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Bachman, p160&lt;/ref&gt; His bolder style was immediately acclaimed by audiences; Segantini received gold medals in Munich (for ''Midday in the Alps'') and Turin (for ''Ploughing''). The following year the [[Walker Art Gallery]] in [[Liverpool]] purchased his major painting, ''[[The Punishment of Lust]]''.

[[File:Mittag in den Alpen 1891.jpg|thumb|''Midday in the Alps'', 1891. {{Interlanguage link multi|Segantini Museum|de}}, [[St. Moritz]]]]
It is thought that Grubicy introduced the concept of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] to Segantini during his recent visit.&lt;ref&gt;Montreal, p37&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his connections with artists in France, Grubicy would have known about the recently published [[Symbolist Manifesto]] by [[Jean Moréas]]. This essay is credited with introducing visual artists to the then nascent literary movement led by [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], and [[Paul Valéry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallery.sjsu.edu/paris/symbolism/introduction.html |title=Symbolism|accessdate=2011-05-01|author=Unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1890 Salon des XX in Brussels, Segantini was given an entire exhibition room, an honor awarded such greats as [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]] and [[Van Gogh]]. While his fame had increased throughout Europe, he was never able to attend international shows because he could not obtain a passport due to his stateless status. Frustrated that the government would not grant him citizenship papers in spite of his fame, Segantini refused to pay cantonal taxes in Savognin. After creditors pursued him he moved his family to the [[Engadin]] valley (altitude 5,954 feet/1,815 meters) in another part of Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Bachmann, p160&lt;/ref&gt; There the high mountain passes and clear light become his chief subject matter for the next five years.

After he moved higher into the mountains he began to study philosophy, concentrating on those writers who questioned the meaning of life and one's place in the natural world. He studied [[Maeterlinck]], [[D'Annunzio]] and [[Goethe]] and especially [[Nietzsche]], becoming so fascinated with the latter that he drew an illustration for the first Italian translation of [[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, p198&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after arriving he made the acquaintance of [[Giovanni Giacometti]], father of [[Alberto Giacometti]], and an artist in his own right. Giacometti would later paint a portrait of Segantini on his death bed and complete some of Segantini's unfinished works posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;Bachmann, p160&lt;/ref&gt; Segantini also met and corresponded at length with [[Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo]], an Italian [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] whose color techniques he admired.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, p198&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The_Evil_Mothers_by_Giovanni_Segantini.jpg|thumb|''{{Interlanguage link multi|Le cattive madri|de|3=Die bösen Mütter}} (The Bad Mothers)'', 1894. [[Kunsthaus Zürich]]]]
Segantini continued to gain recognition in Italy, and in 1894 the Castello Sforzesco in Milan put on a retrospective of ninety of his works. At the first [[Venice Biennale]] in 1895, Segantini was awarded the Prize of the Italian State for his painting ''Return to the Homeland''. He continued to gain fame when a whole room was devoted to his work in the Munich Secession in 1896. After seeing his painting ''The Sad Hour'' in Munich, the director of the [[Alte Nationalgalerie]] in Berlin purchased the work for that museum.&lt;ref&gt;Stutzer, p203&lt;/ref&gt; That same year his painting ''Ploughing'' is bought by the [[Neue Pinakothek]] in Munich.

In 1897, Segantini was commissioned by a group of local hotels to build a huge panorama of the Engadin valley to be shown in a specially built round hall at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Fraquelli, p163&lt;/ref&gt; For this project he worked almost exclusively outdoors on large canvases covered by substantial wooden shelters. Before it was completed, however, the project had to be scaled down for financial reasons. Segantini redesigned the concept into a large [[triptych]] known as ''Life'', ''Nature'' and ''Death'' (Segantini Museum, St. Moritz), which is now his most famous work. He continued to work on it until his death.

Segantini's importance as an international artist was further established that same year, when the Austrian state financed a luxury monograph on his work.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, 1897&lt;/ref&gt; Museums throughout Europe vied to buy his paintings, including ''The Comfort of Faith'', purchased by the [[Hamburger Kunsthalle]] and ''The Bad Mothers'' ([[Österreichische Galerie Belvedere]], Vienna), bought by the Vienna Secession. In 1899 an entire room is devoted to Segantini's work at the annual exhibition of the Societe des Beaux-Arts in Brussels.

Eager to finish the third part of his large tryptich, ''Nature'' (Segantini Museum, St. Moritz) Segantini returned to the high altitude of the mountains near Schafberg. The pace of his work, coupled with the high altitude, affected his health, and in mid-September he became ill with acute [[peritonitis]]. Two weeks later he died. His son Mario and his partner Bice were with him at his death bed.

At the end of November, a memorial exhibition of his works was put on display in Milan. Two years later the largest Segantini retrospective to date took place in Vienna. In 1908, the Segantini Museum was established in [[St. Moritz]], its design inspired by one of the sketches for the pavilions for the Engadine Panorama.&lt;ref&gt;Stutzer (1999), p204&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
More than anything else, Segantini's work represents the quintessential transition from traditional nineteenth-century art to the changing styles and interests of the twentieth century. He began with simple scenes of common people living off of the earth— peasants, farmers, shepherds—and moved toward a thematic symbolist style that continued to embody the landscapes around him while intertwining [[pantheism|pantheistic]] images representing "a primeval Arcadia".&lt;ref&gt;Bachmann, P35&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of his life, he moved from both the physical and emotional internal, such as his scene of motherhood in a stable, to the grand external views of the mountain scenery where he chose to live.

Nature and the connections of people to nature are the core themes of his art. After he moved to the mountains he wrote "I am now working passionately in order to wrest the secret of Nature's spirit from her. Nature utters the eternal word to the artist: love, love; and the earth sings life in spring, and the soul of things reawakens."&lt;ref&gt;Leykauf-Segantini, p180; translated into English in Bachmann, p146&lt;/ref&gt;

His 1896 painting ''Love at the Springs of Life'' (Galleria Civica d'Arte Moderna, Milan) reflects Segantini's philosophical approach to his art. Set in the high mountain landscape near his home, it pictures an angel with large wings spread over a small waterfall flowing from some rocks. In the distance two lovers, clothed in white flowing robes, walk along a path coming toward the spring. Around them are flowers that would have been seen by viewers at the time as symbols of love and life.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, p198&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian Robert Rosenblum described Segantini as transforming "the earthbound into the spiritual",&lt;ref&gt;Quinsac, p38&lt;/ref&gt;  and the artist himself referred to his work as "naturalist Symbolism".&lt;ref&gt;Quinsac, p40&lt;/ref&gt; He said "I've got God inside me. I don't need to go to church."&lt;ref&gt;Helslewood, p53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruling==
According to the reporter's summation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In an action by the endorser against the promisor of a [[promissory note]] negotiated subsequent to the day of payment, the defendant may go into such evidence as he would have been entitled to had the action been brought by the original promisee. The deposition of a person used in a former trial is competent [[evidence]] in a review, though the [[Deposition (law)|deponent]] is a party to the suit, having become administrator of one of the original parties.&lt;ref&gt;''Gold v. Eddy'', 1 Mass. 1 (1804)[http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/1/1mass1.html] (accessed June 21, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5863">'''Gysbert Van Steenwyk''' (January 30, 1814 – April 13, 1902) was an American banker and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politician from [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/vann-vanvorhis.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Born Gijsbert van Steenwijk as the son of Arnoud van Steenwijk and Neeltje van Vliet in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], the [[Netherlands]], Van Steenwyk received an [[academy|academic education]]. He served as a volunteer in the [[Royal Netherlands Army]] in 1830-31, and as a commissioned officer of the [[National Reserve Corps#History|National Guards]] from 1833 to 1849. Van Steenwyk graduated from the [[University of Utrecht]], graduating with a degree in philosophy and [[classical literature]] in 1836.

== In the United States ==
He came to the United States in May 1849, and settled in Milwaukee until 1851, when he moved to [[Newport, Wisconsin|Newport, Sauk County]], where he resided until 1858; then removed to [[Kilbourn City, Wisconsin|Kilbourn City]] in [[Columbia County, Wisconsin|Columbia County]].

== Public office ==
Van Steenwyk was appointed consul of the Netherlands for Wisconsin in 1849, and additionally for [[Michigan]] and [[Minnesota]] in 1850 (he would resign as consul in 1859). He was appointed Commissioner of Immigration for Wisconsin in New York City by [[Governor of Wisconsin]] [[Leonard J. Farwell]] from 1852 to 1853. He was appointed as a [[Brigadier General]] of the Wisconsin [[State Militia]] in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;''Magazine of Western History'', 1888, pp. 304-309.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew J.

Milwaukee: Evening Wisconsin Co., 1897, pp. 337-339.&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Steenwyk, at that time working as a [[real estate agent|land]] and [[insurance agent]] and living in Kilbourn City (now called Wisconsin Dells) was elected as a Republican member of the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]] in 1858&lt;ref&gt;State of Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau.

== After serving as Comptroller ==
In January 1862 he moved to La Crosse, where he worked as a banker. From 1873 to 1874, Van Steenwyk served as Mayor of La Crosse.&lt;ref&gt;La Crosse Public Library Archives, "[http://www.lacrosselibrary.org/userfiles/mss00G.pdf Mss G].&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected senator from the [[Wisconsin Senate, District 31]] ([[La Crosse County, Wisconsin|La Crosse County]]) for 1879-80,&lt;ref&gt;State of Wisconsin Legislative Bureau.

'''''Halsbury's Statutes of England and Wales''''' (commonly referred to as ''Halsbury's Statutes'') provides updated texts of every [[Public General Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], [[Measure of the National Assembly for Wales|Measure]] of the [[Welsh Assembly]], or [[Church of England]] [[Church of England Measures|Measure]] currently in force in England and Wales (and to various extents in [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]), as well as a number of [[Private act|private]] and [[local Act|local Acts]], with detailed annotations to each section and [[schedule|Schedule of each Act]]. It incorporates the effects of new Acts of Parliament and secondary legislation into existing legislation to provide a consolidated "as amended" text of the current [[statute book]].

''Halsbury's Statutes'' was created in 1929. The full title of this work was ''The Complete Statutes of England Classified and Annotated in Continuation of [[Halsbury’s Laws of England]] and for ready reference entitled Halsbury’s Statutes of England''. As indicated by the title, the new work was to be a companion to ''Halsbury’s Laws of England'' and therefore bears the name of [[Hardinge Giffard, 1st Earl of Halsbury|Lord Halsbury]].

The first edition, in twenty volumes, appeared between 1929 and 1931. The new encyclopedia was based on the design of the earlier ''[[Butterworths|Butterworths’ Twentieth Century Statutes (Annotated)]]'', a work in five volumes covering the Acts of 1900 to 1909, which had been kept up to date by annual supplemental volumes. Like its companion, [[Halsbury's Laws of England|''Halsbury's Laws'']], it was arranged by subject matter.  This new work, however, expanded on the previous statutory work in that it included all primary legislation in force at the time of publication.

The second edition in 33 volumes was published from 1948 to 1954.&lt;ref&gt;John S James and Leslie F Maxwell. ''[[A Bibliography of the British Commonwealth of Nations]]''. Second Edition. Sweet &amp; Maxwell. 1957. Volume 2. Page 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current edition (the fourth), in fifty volumes, was published between 1985 and 1992, and is supplemented by an annual hardbound supplement and periodic loose-leaf updates. It is published by [[LexisNexis Butterworths]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Halsbury's Statutes &amp; Statutory Instruments | publisher = LexisNexis Butterworths | accessdate = 2007-08-10 | url = http://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/hssi/index.htm | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071008052317/http://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/hssi/index.htm | archivedate = 2007-10-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual volumes are reissued when there has been a significant impact on the subject matter concerned through changes in legislation.

The complete set consists of the main volumes, the index, tables of statutes, secondary legislation and cases, the annual Cumulative Supplement and the quarterly [[looseleaf service]]. ''Halsbury's Statutes'' is also available as a searchable electronic archive on a paid subscription basis.

'''Legal socialization''' is the process through which, individuals acquire attitudes and beliefs about the [[law]], legal authorities, and legal institutions. This occurs through individuals' interactions, both personal and vicarious, with police, courts, and other legal actors. To date, most of what is known about legal socialization comes from studies of individual differences among adults in their [[Legitimacy (political)|perceived legitimacy of law and legal institutions]], and in their cynicism about the law and its underlying norms.  adults' attitudes about the [[legitimacy of law]] are directly tied to individuals' compliance with the law and cooperation with legal authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2776646 | pmid=19915683 | volume=96 | title=DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES OF LEGAL SOCIALIZATION AMONG SERIOUS ADOLESCENT OFFENDERS | year=2005 | journal=J Crim Law Criminol | pages=267–298 | last1 = Piquero | first1 = AR | last2 = Fagan | first2 = J | last3 = Mulvey | first3 = EP | last4 = Steinberg | first4 = L | last5 = Odgers | first5 = C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to June L. Tapp,
{{Quote|Compliance to laws and respect for authority is variously called socialization, internalization of norms, conformity to rules, identification, moral internalization, and conscience formation. Regardless of nomenclature, psychologists have attended to the problem of compliant behaviour as an aspect of socialisation research, crucial to the maintenance of the social system. Essentially socialisation is the process whereby members of a society learn its norms and acquire its values and behaviour patterns.&lt;ref name="red.pucp.edu.pe"&gt;http://red.pucp.edu.pe/ridei/files/2012/09/120915.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Legal socialization consists of an individual's attitudes toward the legal system (referred to as legitimacy), the law ([[legal cynicism]]), and moral codes that guide behaviour (moral disengagement)

==Definition==
Judith Torney includes, recognition of law, understanding function of the law, accurately recognising source of law, developing relevant attitudes towards those who enforce the law, bringing personal behaviour into line with morality and legality.&lt;ref name="Don Rowe"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rowe|first1=Don|author2=Rowe|editor1-last=Lynch|editor1-first=James|editor2-last=Modgil|editor2-first=Celia|editor3-last=Modgil|editor3-first=Sohan|title=Law related Education : An Overview|date=1992|publisher=Routledge Falmer Taylor &amp; Francis Group|location=London &amp; Philadelphia P.A.|isbn=1-85000-995-3|page=69-86|edition=2002|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zI4ABAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=Legal%20awareness%20And%20Civics&amp;pg=PP4#v=onepage&amp;q=Legal%20awareness%20And%20Civics&amp;f=false |accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal internalisation and jurisprudential reception and process of acculturation==
{{main|Internalisation (sociology)|Jurisprudential reception}}
[[File:Eleanor Roosevelt and Human Rights Declaration.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Laws]] are only observed with the consent of the individuals concerned and a moral change still depends on the individual and not on the passage of any law. ~ [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] ]]
Internalisation ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|or]] internalization) in [[sociology]] and other [[social sciences]] is the process of acceptance of a set of norms and values established by people or groups which are influential to the individual through the process of [[socialisation]]. 
John Finley Scott described internalisation as a metaphor in which something (i.e. an idea, concept, action) moves from outside the mind or personality to a place inside of it.&lt;ref name="Internalization of Norms"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=John|title=Internalization of Norms: A sociological Theory of Moral Commitment|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure and the happenings of society shapes one's inner self and it can also be reversed.

The process of internalisation starts with learning what the norms are, and then the individual goes through a process of understanding why they are of value or why they make sense, until finally they accept the norm as their own viewpoint.&lt;ref name="Internalization of Norms" /&gt; Internalised norms are said to be part of an individual's personality and may be exhibited by one's moral actions. However, there can also be a distinction between internal commitment to a norm and what one exhibits externally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mead|first=George|title=Mind, Self, and Society|year=1934| publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through internalisation individuals accept a set of norms and values that are established by other individuals, groups, or society as a whole.

Norm acceptance, norm confirmity and norm compliance can be achieved by coercion, acultuaration, or persuasion. But the commitment to the law can be better achieved by process of internalisation and legitimacy of law helpful in this process.&lt;ref&gt;Koh, Harold Hongju, " Internalization Through Socialization " (2005). Faculty Scholarship Series. Paper 1786. http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_paper{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} s/1786&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Marju Luts reception is chiefly defined as the transfer of a legal phenomenon of a different legal culture, other area or other period of time to a new legal climate. Awareness of the recipient that its activity is truly the adoption of an element of law that is, in a legal-cultural context, hitherto alien (or already forgotten). The matter is further specified on the basis of whether such awareness is characteristic of the whole recipient society or only the initiators of reception.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.juridicainternational.eu/?id=12458&lt;/ref&gt;  awareness, Voluntariness

The Author(s): Chantal Kourilsky-Augeven believe pre-eminence previously given to the transmission processes of  values, norms and behavioural models should be renounced in favour of a definition of legal socialisation during  childhood and adolescence, from the perspective of the subject playing an active part; Law must be considered as a fundamental part of the culture the subject belongs to; The subject acquires the common knowledge of the dominant legal culture in his society by  "legal acculturation of the subject" ; In parallel occurs the "acculturation by the subject" concerning different objects of the common legal culture. The "legal acculturation of the subject" would thus occur thanks to the transmission by school (or other channels conveying of the common culture), integrating the historical experience assimilated by national culture and fundamental concepts and values of the national legal heritage (in particular regarding the state, the citizen, law or justice) while the subject would himself proceed to the "acculturation of these  concepts" in light of the codes of interpretation of reality acquired within his close environment in order to integrate them within his own system of representations.&lt;ref name="ejls.eu"&gt;http://www.ejls.eu/1/13UK.htm#_ftn1&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Torney describes three processes of legal socialisation namely, "accumulation process", "identification process" and "role transfer process". In accumulation process, law is learned from range of various sources. In "the identification process", attitudes and values of significant adults are  absorbed in a natural psychological process wherein a tendency to adopt beliefs with whom one identifies and is socially bonded makes the impact. Whereas in "the role transfer process" from immediate surroundings like home or school one accepts rule making and implementing authority of the seniors and imputes the same and provides legitimacy to law making and/or enforcing agencies like police.&lt;ref name="Don Rowe" /&gt; 

===Legal necessity reception===
Where there is an apparent need for a change of legal system in one culture and another existing culture provides an opportunity to satisfy the need

===Legal veneration reception===
Veneration reception is one example which occurs if alien norms, institutes or a whole system is adopted for their venerated position and prestige of cultural background.

===Imposed legal reception===
If a legal phenomenon is imposed upon another nation by force on another nation is referred to as imposed legal reception, in few instances  under certain  conditions imposed reception may transform into a voluntary process and thus become genuine reception but usually imposed legal phenomenon would not be considered genuine legal reception .

===Legal transplantation===
is a process whereby a legal phenomenon transfers to another geographic area or culture together with people. A situation where a norm of another legal culture is established in a different legal climate by enacting legislation regardless of its original implementation background may also be interpreted as a mere transplantation of a legal phenomenon. Transplantation also occurs where a legal theory is taken to another geographical area. As in the case of imposed reception or voluntary reception, an original transplantation may become true reception: of course not among the group or nation which is the carrier of transplantation but among the legal culture surrounding it in the new area. The transformation of transplantation into reception is perhaps of greater significance in the history of legal science than it is in positive law.

===Methodological and systematic  reception===
in which the spread of legal doctrines and theories plays an especially important role. It is quite clear that the spread of methods brings about the spread of their conceptual and systematic basis. In this regard, system not only refers to a certain classification of legal material, but an internally consistent and systematic approach to law.

==Explicit and implicit legal socialisation==
"Explicit legal socialisation", which covers socially obvious
aspects of law, consciously identified with what he calls law, should be distinguished from "implicit legal socialisation" which regulates every day situations that the subject does not associate with law, due to their familiarity in every day life.

"Implicit" or "subconscious" legal socialisation – whereby the subject does not realise it is a matter of law, but thinks it is only ordinary practice – seems as effective as the first type of socialisation.&lt;ref name="ejls.eu"/&gt;

==Approaches==
*legal socialization measure
Procedural justice (the perceived fairness of legal system i.e. the police, judge, and defense attorney)  is related to the overall measure of legal socialization and each of its individual components wise legitimacy, legal cynicism, and moral disengagement

According to Chantal Kourilsky - Augeven, phenomena of individuals' socialisation have been developed in three disciplines: psychology, anthropology and sociology. Psychologists, who study at the level of the individual, emphasize the construction of the personality or identity of the subject. Anthropologists start with a specific culture, considered as an entity formed by a group of people who share "ways of thinking, feeling and acting", values and behavioural norms. These common values and norms are then internalised by new generations and ensure the cohesion and continuance of the community. Like anthropologists, sociologists view the object of study from the perspective of society as a whole, but perceive socialisation more strongly in terms of the transmission of behavioural norms and models by persons and institutions. They tend to assign to them, for functional purposes, the role of socialisation agents. Socialisation of subjects is also considered in terms of learning of social roles or attainment of social skills.&lt;ref name="http://www.ejls.eu/1/13.htm#_ftn1"&gt;http://www.ejls.eu/1/13.htm#_ftn1&lt;/ref&gt;

These three approaches tend to combine into two schools of thought. The first gives pre-eminence to the subject's viewpoint, but can only consider its development in relation to the interactions with the culture and society in which he is immersed. The second gives pre-eminence to society or culture as a whole, but can only apprehend subjects' modalities of adaptation or participation in this society by looking at modalities of individual development.&lt;ref name="http://www.ejls.eu/1/13.htm#_ftn1"/&gt;

==Authority and legitimacy==
[[File:Vrouwejustitia.jpg|thumb|Just laws which uphold human rights are the necessary foundation of peace. ~ [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] ]]
[[File:United States Declaration of Independence.jpg|thumb|right|It is not the enactment, but the observance of laws, that creates the character of a nation. ~ [[Calvin Coolidge]] ]]
When experiences with legal actors are perceived as fair, just and proportionate, these experiences reinforce the legitimacy of the
law, and can contribute to compliance and desistance. However, when punishment is delivered unfairly, unjustly and/or disproportionately, it leads to cynicism about the law, and can contribute to anger and persistence (Sampson and Bartusch, 1998; Kirk and Papachristos, 2011; Papachristos,Meares and Fagan, 2012). It is easier in a democratic and pluralist society to exercise authority through legitimacy, i.e. Acting in ways that people find appropriate, reasonable and just.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/microsites/tax-policy/files/LTW/police_stops_and_legitimacy_january_22_2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tom R. Tyler, People obey the law if they believe it's legitimate, not because they fear punishment—this is the startling conclusion of Tom Tyler's classic study. Tyler suggests that lawmakers and law enforcers would do much better to make legal systems worthy of respect than to try to instill fear of punishment. He finds that people obey law primarily because they believe in respecting legitimate authority. Brute coercive power may achieve obedience but will not sustain it. Only a sense of fairness, trust and legitimacy can do that by nurturing feelings of obligation. When outcomes are fair, and the procedures that lead to those outcomes transparent and just, people will follow rules, cooperate with police, pay fines, and accept punishment. Procedural justice - the experience directly or vicariously of transparency, fairness, neutrality and respect in dealings with criminal justice - is vital for any rule-following behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/Why_People_Obey_the_Law.html?id=77G9sCO_MKIC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.opendemocracy.net/gavin-slade-alexander-kupatadze/failed-mental-revolution-georgia-crime-and-criminal-justice&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal socialization among children and youth==
[[File:Moden day intergration.png|thumb|Settled Irish socializing with modern-day traveller to promote integration]]
In order to better understand representations and behaviours of adults in
relation to law and rights, their origin in childhood and adolescence are of relevance.&lt;ref name="red.pucp.edu.pe"/&gt; Legal socialization is shaped during adolescence and that these attitudes are influenced by perceptions of fairness of interactions with authority figures and are important because they are related to delinquent behavior. (Fagan &amp; Tyler, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;https://sswr.confex.com/sswr/2015/webprogram/Paper24328.html&lt;/ref&gt; School specific (un-)fairness experiences can affect legal socialisation of students.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=JEpHFOWOzi0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=Legal+socialisation&amp;ots=LIo1qGr78X&amp;sig=rkHiR4Iww9zvKn6Z7G8wH2Wuulg#v=onepage&amp;q=Legal%20socialisation&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth who perceive their experiences procedural justice  being less fair have more negative attitudes about the law, legal system, and moral rules and codes. Youth with more negative views of the legal system and moral codes participate in more delinquent behavior. Legitimacy and moral disengagement components and overall measure of legal socialization are related to higher levels of delinquent behavior.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3924">The '''Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia''' ({{lang-fr|Assemblée législative d'Assiniboine}}) was a short-lived [[legislature]] set up to pass laws for the [[North-Western Territory]] and [[Rupert's Land]] under the provisional government led by [[Louis Riel]] from 1869 to 1870. The Legislative Assembly was named after the [[Council of Assiniboia]] that previously managed the territories before the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] sold the land to Canada in 1869.&lt;ref name="assem"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/ana/pdf/mbmetispolicy/laa_en.pdf |title=A History of the Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia / le Conseil du Gouvernement Provisoire |publisher=Government of Manitoba |last=Hall |first=Norma |author2=Hall, Clifford P |author3=Verrier, Erin  |accessdate=2013-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guidelines for the creation of the elected assembly had been established during the Convention of Forty in January and February 1870 and elections followed shortly afterwards. The number of representatives of constituencies considered to be English-speaking and those considered to be French-speaking were made equal. The assembly operated from March 9, 1870 to June 24, 1870. Its final act was to accept the agreement negotiated with Canada for the new province of Manitoba to enter [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] and to ratify the [[Manitoba Act]].&lt;ref name="assem"/&gt;

{{Chinese Legalism}}
'''Li Si''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|_|ˈ|s|iː}}; {{circa}} 280 BC{{snd}}September or October 208 BC) was a Chinese politician of the [[Qin dynasty]], well known [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalist]] writer and politician, and notable calligrapher. He served as [[Chancellor (China)|Chancellor]] (or Prime Minister) from 246–208 BC under two rulers: [[Qin Shi Huang]], the king of the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] and later the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty; and [[Qin Er Shi]], Qin Shi Huang's eighteenth son and the Second Emperor.&lt;ref name="Sima"&gt;[[Sima Qian]], ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning administrative methods, Li Si "indicated that he admired and utilized the ideas of [[Shen Buhai]]", repeatedly referring to the technique of Shen Buhai and [[Han Fei]], but regarding law followed [[Shang Yang]].&lt;ref&gt;Herrlee G. Creel. Shen Pu-Hai: A Chinese Political Philosopher of the Fourth Century B. C.. p.138, 151-152&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanford University]]'s John Knoblock considered Li Si "one of the two or three most important figures in Chinese history". Having a clear vision of universal empire and "one world comprising all Chinese, bringing with universal dominion universal peace", Li Si was "largely responsible for the creation of those institutions that made the Qin dynasty the first universal state in Chinese history".

Li Si assisted the Emperor Shi Huangdi in unifying the laws, governmental ordinances, weights and measures, and standardized chariots, carts, and the characters used in writing... [facilitating] the cultural unification of China. He "created a government based solely on merit, so that in the empire sons and younger brothers in the imperial clan were not ennobled, but meritorious ministers were", and "pacified the frontier regions by subduing the barbarians to the north and south". He had the weapons of the feudal states melted and cast into musical bells and large human statues, and relaxed taxes and the draconian punishments inherited from [[Shang Yang]].&lt;ref&gt;Xunzi Volume 1. p 37. John Knoblock&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Li Si was originally from [[Cai (state)|Shang Cai]] (上蔡) in the [[Chu (state)|State of Chu]].&lt;ref name="Goldin"&gt;''Li Si, Chancellor of the Universe in'' {{cite book|last=Hammond|first=Kenneth James|title=The Human Tradition in Pre-modern China|publisher=Scholarly Resources, Inc.|year=2002 | isbn = 978-0-8420-2959-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young man he was a minor functionary in the local administration of Chu. According to the ''[[Records of the Great Historian]]'', one day Li Si observed that rats in the outhouse were dirty and hungry but the rats in the barn house were well fed. He suddenly realized that "there is no set standard for honour since everyone's life is different.  The values of people are determined by their social status.  And like rats, people's social status often depends purely on the random life events around them.  And so instead of always being restricted by moral codes, people should do what they deemed best at the moment." He made up his mind to take up politics as a career, which was a common choice for scholars not from a noble family during the [[Warring States period]].

Li Si was unable to advance his career in Chu.  He believed that achieving nothing in life while being so intelligent and educated would bring shame to not just himself but to all scholars.  After having finished his education with the famous [[Confucian]] thinker [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]], he moved to the [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]], the most powerful state at that time in an attempt to advance his political career.

== Career in Qin ==
During his stay in [[Qin (state)|Qin]], Li Si became a guest of Prime Minister [[Lü Buwei]] and got the chance to talk to the ruler of Ying Zheng who would later become the first emperor of a unified China, [[Qin Shi Huang]]. Li Si expressed that the Qin state was extremely powerful, but uniting China was still impossible if all of the other six states united to fight against Qin.  Qin Shi Huang was impressed by Li Si's view of how to unify [[China]]. Having adopted Li Si's proposal, the ruler of Qin spent generously to lure intellectuals to the state of Qin and sent out assassins to kill important scholars in other states.
[[File:廷尉之印.jpg|thumb|Seal of Tingwei. Tingwei was the official in charge of judiciary, Li Si was appointed as the Tingwei of Qin after the guest officers expulsion incident.]]
In 237 BC a clique at the Qin court urged King Zheng to expel all foreigners from the state to prevent espionage. As a native of Chu, Li Si would be a target of the policy so he memorialised the king explaining the many benefits of foreigners to Qin including "the sultry girls of Zhao".&lt;ref name="Sima" /&gt; The king relented and, impressed with Li Si's rhetoric, promoted him.&lt;ref name="Goldin" /&gt; The same year, Li Si is reported to have urged King Zheng to annex the neighbouring [[Han (state)|State of Han]] to order to intimidate the other five remaining states. Li Si also wrote the "Petition against the Expulsion of Guest Officers” ([[Jianzhuke Shu]]) in 234 BC. [[Han Fei]], a member of the aristocracy from the State of Han, was asked by the Han king to go to Qin and resolve the situation through diplomacy. Li Si, who envied Han Fei's intellect, persuaded the Qin king that he could neither send Han Fei back (as his superior ability would be a threat to Qin) nor employ him (as his loyalty would not be to Qin). As a result, Han Fei was imprisoned, and in 233 BC convinced by Li Si to commit suicide by taking poison. The State of Han was later conquered in 230 BC.

After Qin Shi Huang became emperor Li Si persuaded him to suppress intellectual dissent.&lt;ref name="Sima" /&gt; Li Si believed that books regarding things such as [[medicine]], [[agriculture]] and [[prophecy]] could be ignored but political books were dangerous in public hands.  It was hard to make progress and change the country with the opposition of so many "free thinking" scholars.  As a result, only the state should keep political books, and only the state run schools should be allowed to educate political scholars. Li Si himself penned the edict ordering the destruction of historical records and literature in 213 BC, including key Confucian texts, which he thought detrimental to the welfare of the state.  It is commonly thought that 460 Confucian scholars were buried alive, from the well-known historical event "[[Burning of books and burying of scholars|Burning Books and Burying Confucianists]]" (焚书坑儒); however, this was a mistranslation in later historical texts. In reality, the 460 people who were buried alive by the Qin emperor, Shi Huang Di, were mainly priests and shamans who were alleged to be depriving the emperor of resources and wealth while looking for medicines that would grant eternal life or [[apotheosis]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

== Death ==
When [[Qin Shi Huang]] died while away from the capital, Li Si and the chief eunuch [[Zhao Gao]] suppressed the late emperor's choice of successor, which was [[Fusu]]. At that time Fusu was close friends with [[Meng Tian]].  If Fusu became the next emperor there was a high chance Meng Tian would replace Li Si as prime minister.  Fearing a loss of power, Li Si decided to betray the dead Qin Shi Huang.  Li Si and Zhao Gao tricked Fusu into committing suicide, and installed another prince, [[Qin Er Shi]] (229 BC – 207 BC) in his place. During the tumultuous aftermath, Zhao Gao convinced the new emperor to install his followers in official positions. When his power base was secure enough, Zhao Gao betrayed Li Si and charged him with treason.  Qin Er Shi, who viewed Zhao Gao as his teacher, did not question his decision.  Zhao Gao had Li Si tortured until he admitted the crime. In 208 BC, Zhao Gao had Li Si executed via [[waist chop]] (腰斩), Li's own invention. He also had Li Si's entire family exterminated.

== Contributions ==
Believing in a highly bureaucratic system, Li Si is considered{{by whom|date=July 2014}} to have been central to the efficiency of the state of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] and the success of its military conquest. He was also instrumental in systematizing standard measures and currency in post-unified China.  He further helped systematize the written [[Chinese language]] by promulgating as the imperial standard the [[small seal script]] which had already been in use in the state of [[Qin (state)|Qin]].  In this process, variant glyphs within the Qin script were proscribed, as were variant scripts from the different regions which had been conquered. This would have a unifying effect on the Chinese culture for thousands of years.{{efn|name=seal script}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen (陳)|first=Zhaorong (昭容)|title=Research on the Qín (Ch'in) Lineage of Writing: An Examination from the Perspective of the History of Chinese Writing (中央研究院歷史語言研究所專刊)|year=2003|language=Chinese|publisher=Academia Sinica, Institute of History and Philology Monograph | isbn = 978-957-671-995-0 }} pp. 10 &amp; 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Li Si was also the author of the ''[[Cangjiepian]]'', the first Chinese language primer of which fragments still exist.&lt;ref&gt;''Outstretched Leaves on his Bamboo Staff: Essays in Honour of [[Göran Malmqvist]] on his 70th Birthday, Joakim Enwall, ed., Stockholm: Association of Oriental Studies, 1994, p 97–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{efn
| name = seal script
| According to Academia Sinica philologist Chen Zhaorong, seal script not only already existed in the E. Zhou period, but was already undergoing a trend toward standardization at that time. Further standardization was carried out by Lĭ Sī and others, and this final standardized form became known to the Hàn people as small seal script.

*Immigration Bureau directed to deport unlawful aliens.
*Empowered "the superintendent of immigration to enforce immigration laws".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=5779&amp;page=23|title=2 Background to Contemporary U.S. Immigration - The New Americans: Economic, Demographic, and Fiscal Effects of Immigration - The National Academies Press|publisher=|doi=10.17226/5779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=169&amp;invol=649|title=FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|The Supreme Court ruled that a child of Chinese descent born in the United States - whose parents at the time of his birth are subjects of the Emperor of China but who are domiciled in the United States as permanent residents; are carrying on business there; and are not employed in any diplomatic or other official capacity under the Emperor of China - is a citizen of the United States by virtue of having been born "in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof," per the first clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Several years later, in the wake of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 San Francisco Earthquake and Fire]], a number of Chinese immigrants who were otherwise subject to the Chinese Exclusion Act were nonetheless able to claim American citizenship by alleging they were born in San Francisco, and that ''their'' birth certificates had been destroyed along with those of everyone else who had been born in San Francisco.  "Papers for fictitious children were sold in China, allowing Chinese to immigrate despite the laws."
&lt;ref name="Chinese Laborers Work on a Railroad"/&gt;
|-
|1903
|[[Immigration Act of 1903]] (Anarchist Exclusion Act)

|-
|1906
|[[Naturalization Act of 1906]]

* Standardized naturalization procedures
* Made some knowledge of English a requirement for citizenship
* Established the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization
|-
|1907
|[[Immigration Act of 1907]]
|Restricted immigration for certain classes of disabled and diseased people
|-
|1917
|[[Immigration Act of 1917]] (Barred Zone Act)
|Restricted immigration from Asia by creating an "Asiatic Barred Zone" and introduced a reading test for all immigrants over sixteen years of age, with certain exceptions for children, wives, and elderly family members.

|-
|1921
|[[Emergency Quota Act]]
|
*Limited the number of immigrants a year from any country to 3% of those already in the US from that country as per the 1910 census.
"An unintended consequence of the 1920s legislation was an increase in illegal immigration. Many Europeans who did not fall under the quotas migrated to Canada or Mexico, which [as Western Hemisphere nations] were not subject to national-origin quotas; [and] subsequently they slipped into the United States illegally." &lt;ref&gt;
James P. Smith and Barry Edmonston, Eds. ''The New Americans: Economic, Demographic, and Fiscal Effects of Immigration'', (1997). [[The National Academic Press]]. page 26, 4th paragraph. {{ISBN|0-309-06356-6}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|1922
|The [[Cable Act of 1922]] (ch. 411, 42 Stat. 1021, "Married Women’s Independent Nationality Act")
|Reversed former immigration laws regarding marriage, also known as the Married Women's Citizenship Act or the Women's Citizenship Act. Previously, a woman lost her US citizenship if she married a foreign man, since she assumed the citizenship of her husband, a law that did not apply to men who married foreign women. The law repealed sections 3 and 4 of the Expatriation Act of 1907.
*
|-
|1924
|[[Immigration Act of 1924|Immigration Act]] (Johnson-Reed Act)
|
*Imposed first permanent numerical limit on immigration.
*Began a national-origin quota system.
|-
|1924
|[[National Origins Formula]]
|
* Established with the [[Immigration Act of 1924]].
* Total annual immigration was capped at 150,000. Immigrants fit into two categories: those from quota-nations and those from non-quota nations.
* Immigrant visas from quota-nations were restricted to the same ratio of residents from the country of origin out of 150,000 as the ratio of foreign-born nationals in the United States. The percentage out of 150,000 was the relative number of visas a particular nation received.
* Non-quota nations, notably those contiguous to the United States only had to prove an immigrant's residence in that country of origin for at least two years prior to emigration to the United States.
* Laborers from Asiatic nations were excluded but exceptions existed for professionals, clergy, and students to obtain visas.

'''''HRH the Maharanee of Baroda v Wildenstein''''',&lt;ref name="Maharanee of Baroda v Wildenstein"&gt;''Maharanee of Baroda v Wildenstein'' [1972] 2 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 283, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] (England and Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; was a decision of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|English Court of Appeal]] relating to the [[conflict of laws]], and specifically whether the English courts should take jurisdiction in relation to a claim which had no substantial connections with England on the basis that the defendant was served with proceedings during a brief visit to the country.&lt;ref name=Jaffey&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jaffey on the Conflict of Laws|edition=2nd|publisher=Butterworths|pages=1–2|isbn=0406942870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was decided before the modern development of the doctrine of ''[[forum non conveniens]]'' and the decision of the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''[[Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd]]'',&lt;ref name="Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd]]|court=UKHL|year=1986|num=10|parallelcite= [1987] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 460 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is no longer considered to be good law in that regard.&lt;ref name=Jaffey /&gt;  The case is often still referred to by way of illustration to the parochial and slightly paternalistic view previously taken by the English courts in relation to matters of [[jurisdiction]], and in particular the comments of [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning MR]] and [[Edmund Davies, Baron Edmund-Davies|Edmund Davies LJ]].{{r|Jaffey|p=6}}

However the principle established by the case that presence within the jurisdiction is not negated only because it is a short or transient presence remains good law.&lt;ref name=DMC&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Dicey Morris &amp; Collins]]|edition=14th|at=14-054|publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]]|isbn=9780421883604}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNF&gt;{{cite book|title=Cheshire North &amp; Fawcett on Private International Law|edition=14th|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=355|isbn=9780199284382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==

The [[Sita Devi (Maharani of Baroda)|Maharanee of Baroda]]&lt;ref&gt;The case reports all utilise the spelling "Maharanee" rather than the more traditional "Maharani".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Daniel Wildenstein|Mr Wildenstein]] both lived in France, although in the judgment they were both described as being "citizens of the world".  Mr Wildenstein was an art dealer of international repute.  In 1965 the Maharanee purchased a painting from Mr Wildenstein in Paris which was believed to be ''La Poésie'' by [[François Boucher]] for the equivalent of approximately £33,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.needenglish.com/SHOPPING.htm|title="Forum shopping" in international litigiation|author=Kurt Siehr and Eric H. Leake|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968 the painting was reviewed by [[Francis Watson (art historian)|Mr Francis Watson]], who was the [[Surveyor of the Queen's Works of Art|Surveyor of Her Majesty’s works of Art]].  He expressed the view that it was not a Boucher.  The Maharanee sent the painting to [[Christie's]] for a formal valuation.  They expressed the view that the painting "cannot be regarded as an autograph work by François Boucher, but would appear to be a work from his immediate circle of followers.   We think that it might make about £750 at auction...".

The Maharanee instructed her solicitors to issue a writ against Mr Wildenstein claiming that painting was not a Boucher and seeking rescission and repayment of the purchase price.  The writ was issued on 3 September 1969.  However it was not served on Mr Wildenstein until 20 June 1970 when he was in the United Kingdom visiting the [[Ascot Racecourse|Ascot races]].

Mr Wildenstein objected to the court taking jurisdiction, and successfully applied for the writ to be set aside.  The Maharanee appealed against that decision to the Court of Appeal.

==Judgment==

The lead judgment was given by Lord Denning MR.  He held that the writ had been properly served on the defendant in England, and if a defendant is properly served with a writ while he is in this country, albeit on a short visit, the plaintiff was entitled to continue the proceedings to the end.  The plaintiff had validly invoked the jurisdiction of the Queen’s courts; and was entitled to require those courts to proceed to adjudicate upon the claim.  The courts should not strike the claim out unless it was vexatious or oppressive, or otherwise an abuse of the process of the court.  If the statement of claim discloses a reasonable cause of action, the plaintiff is entitled to pursue it in the English courts, even though the cause of action did arise in a foreign country.  It should not be [[stay of proceedings|stayed]] unless it would plainly be unjust to the defendant to require him to defend it in England, and that injustice must be so great as to outweigh the right of the plaintiff to continue the claim here. He held that the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] was on Mr Wildenstein to show that it would be an injustice to him to have the case tried in England, and that he had not discharged that burden.

Edmund Davies and [[John Stephenson (judge)|Stephenson LJJ]] gave concurring judgments.

==Comments==

The case was notable for a number of comments made during the course of judgment about the superior nature of the English courts to the French ones, and rebuffing the notion that it would be inappropriate for the English courts to hear cases that were otherwise unconnected with England.

In relation to the suggestion that the case should properly be tried in France, Lord Denning MR stated:
{{cquote|Furthermore, there might be difficulties, if not injustice, in requiring the Maharanee to go to France to seek redress.  We are told that the courts of France appoint their own court experts and might hesitate about receiving the opinion of experts from England.  It would be a matter for their discretion.  In any case, the French courts might not themselves see the witnesses or hear them cross-examined, but might only read their reports. ...

Apart from the admission of evidence, there is the question of delay.  We have been shown a speech which was made by the Premier President de la Cour de Cassation on October 2, 1970, in which he greatly regretted the delays in the civil procedure in France.  He gave instances, such as a case started on December 22, 1953, which was finally decided on March 5, 1970;  another started in 1950 decided in 1968;  another of 1957 decided in 1969.  It is said that this is due to the delaying tactics of lawyers.  We are used to something of the kind here, but somehow we get over them in less time.  So it does appear that the delay would be a good deal greater in France than in England.  I have no doubt that this case could be brought for trial in England within a year.}}

Lord Denning would echo these comments a year later in ''The Atlantic Star'', where he would say:

{{cquote|You may call this '[[forum shopping]]' if you please, but if the forum is England, it is a good place to shop in, both for the quality of the goods and the speed of service.&lt;ref&gt;''The Atlantic Star'' [1973] [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 364 at 381–382.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Edmund Davies LJ also stated:
{{cquote|... in taking it out and serving it (albeit when the defendant was only fleetingly on British soil) she [the Maharanee] was doing no more than our law permits, even though it may have ruined his [Mr Wildenstein's] day at the races.  Some might regard her action as [[Rudeness|bad form]]; none can legitimately condemn it as an abuse of legal process ...}}

==Significance==

The case is no longer considered good law with respect to taking jurisdiction, and in modern times the decision would likely have been reversed, with a stay being granted on the basis of ''forum non conveniens''.  However the part of the decision that states that any transitory presence within the jurisdiction is still sufficient for the service of a writ remains good law.&lt;ref name=DMC /&gt;&lt;ref name=CNF /&gt;

The position of jurisdiction between the English and French courts is also now regulated by the [[Brussels Regime]].

The '''Married Women's Property Acts''' are laws enacted by the individual states of the [[United States]] beginning in 1839, usually under that name and sometimes, especially when extending the provisions of a Married Women's Property Act, under names describing a specific provision, such as the Married Women's Earnings Act. The Married Women's Property Acts helped to rectify some of the difficulties that women faced under [[Coverture|coverture]], the British common law system that subsumed married women's ability to own property, wages, enter in to contracts, and otherwise act autonomously to their husband's authority. After New York passed their Married Women's Property Law in 1848, this law became the template for other states to grant married women the right to own property.&lt;ref name="Married Women's Property Law"&gt;{{cite web |title=The New York State Married Women's Property Law |url=https://www.nyhistory.org/womens-history/education/curriculum/saving-washington/module-2-breaking-the-rules-women/resources/resource-16-the-new-york-state-married-womens-property-law |website=Women and the American Story: A Curriculum Guide |publisher=The New York Historical Society |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==

Under the [[common law]] legal doctrine known as [[coverture]], a married woman in Great Britain's North American colonies and later in the United States had hardly any legal existence apart from her husband. Her rights and obligations were subsumed under his. She could not own property, enter into contracts, or earn a salary.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Norton, "'Either Married or to bee Married': Women’s Legal Equality in Early America," in Carla Gardina Pestana and Sharon V. Salinger, eds., ''Inequality in Early America'' (University Press of New England, 1999), 25-45&lt;/ref&gt; Over several decades, beginning in 1839, statutes that enabled women to control real and personal property, participate in contracts and lawsuits, inherit independently of their husbands, work for a salary, and write wills were enacted. Usually, concerns for family integrity and protecting a household from economic crisis, rather than a liberal conception of the role of women in society, motivated these changes.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Change came in piecemeal fashion. As late as 1867 a decision of the [[Supreme Court of Illinois]] in ''Cole v. Van Riper'' noted that "It is simply impossible that a married woman should be able to control and enjoy her property as if she were sole, without practically leaving her at liberty to annul the marriage."&lt;ref name=khan&gt;{{cite book|last=Khan|first=B. Zorina |title=The Democratization of Invention: Patents and Copyrights in American Economic Development, 1790-1920 |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=163, 166–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cd0KqQ6rxfEC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;}} Khan provides a table of the states and their enactment of statutes in these three categories.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one analysis, the legislation came in three phases—allowing married women to own property, then to keep their own income, then to engage in business—and advanced more quickly [[Western United States|in the West]], exactly like female suffrage did.&lt;ref name=khan/&gt;

==State by State==

===Connecticut===
[[Connecticut]]'s law of 1809 allowing a married woman to write a will was a forerunner, though its impact on property and contracts was so slight that it is not counted as the first statute to address married women's property rights.&lt;ref name=loc&gt;{{cite web|title=Married Women's Property Laws|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/awhhtml/awlaw3/property_law.html |work=American Women|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the nineteenth century, women in the Northern states were the principal advocates of enhancing women's property rights, but the first legislation embodying some of the changes they advocated was enacted in the American South. The [[Panic of 1837]] inspired attempts to limit the impact of such an economic crisis by protecting family assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Homestead|first=Melissa J.|title=American Women Authors and Literary Property, 1822-1869|year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=NY|pages=43–4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=36L3XxeevSEC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mississippi]] initiated the trend in 1839 with its Married Women's Property Act that allowed married women to own property. Any attempt to collect debt from her husband could not reach property only she owned. She had the right to refuse to sell the property, but could not manage that property or sell it without her husband's consent. Parents who gave property to a daughter upon marriage also enjoyed the protection the Act provided from a son-in-law's mishandling of his family's affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Boswell, "Married Women's Property Rights and the Challenge to the Patriarchal Order: Colorado County, Texas," in Janet L. Coryell, ''Negotiating Boundaries of Southern Womanhood: Dealing With the Powers That Be'' (University of Missouri Press, 2000), 89-109, 92, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3mK6xQMF2wQC&amp;pg=PA92&amp; available online], accessed February 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The property a woman could own and protect from her husband's creditors included slaves.&lt;ref name=speth&gt;Linda E. Speth, "The Married Women's Property Acts, 1839-1865: Reform, Reaction, or Revolution?", in J. Ralph Lindgren, et al, ''The Law of Sex Discrimination'', 4th edition (Wadsworth, 2011), 12-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern States===
Several Southern states adopted similar legislation, beginning with Maryland in 1843 and Arkansas in 1846.&lt;ref name=speth/&gt; Northern states that acted included Michigan in 1844, which covered both real and personal property obtained by a woman before or during her marriage. More limited statutes were passed during the next two years in Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa.&lt;ref name=speth /&gt;

===Texas===
Texas, still an [[Republic of Texas|independent republic]] rather than a state, passed its act in 1840. It was the most expansive legislation of any enacted in the South and allowed a married woman to enter into certain contracts, write a will, and sue for divorce. Not only could she veto the sale of her property, but she could veto the sale of the family homestead even if she was not its owner. Without referencing the independence of the wife that advocates for such legislation envisioned, legislators argued that the legislation protected the wife and children from irresponsible husbands.&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, 93-4, 100. Boswell notes that Texas passed other legislation to restrict the reach of creditors, including the [[Homestead exemption|Homestead Exemption]] Act in 1838.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western States===
The original state constitutions of Kansas (1859), Nevada (1864), and Oregon (1857) guaranteed the right of women to own property without respect to marital status.&lt;ref name=khan/&gt;

===New York===
In 1845, [[New York (state)|New York]] granted a married woman who secured "a patent for her own invention" the right to hold it and retain all earnings from it "as if unmarried".&lt;ref name=khan/&gt; The Married Women's Property Act was enacted on April 7, 1848, as part of a more general movement, underway since the 1820s, away from common law traditions in favor of the codification of law. [[Ernestine Rose]] had been campaigning for such a statute since 1836, later joined by [[Paulina Wright Davis]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]].&lt;ref name=speth /&gt; It significantly altered the law regarding the property rights granted to married women, allowing them to own and control their own property. It was used as a model by several other states in the 1850s. It provided that:&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*The real and personal property of any female who may hereafter marry, and which she shall own at the time of marriage, and the rents issues and profits thereof shall not be subject to the disposal of her husband, nor be liable for his debts, and shall continue her sole and separate property, as if she were a single female.
*The real and personal property, and the rents issues and profits thereof of any female now married shall not be subject to the disposal of her husband; but shall be her sole and separate property as if she were a single female except so far as the same may be liable for the debts of her husband heretofore contracted.
*It shall be lawful for any married female to receive, by gift, grant devise or bequest, from any person other than her husband and hold to her sole and separate use, as if she were a single female, real and personal property, and the rents, issues and profits thereof, and the same shall not be subject to the disposal of her husband, nor be liable for his debts.
*All contracts made between persons in contemplation of marriage shall remain in full force after such marriage takes place.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


===Pennsylvania===
[[Pennsylvania]] followed with similar legislation a few weeks later.&lt;ref name=mcmillen&gt;{{cite book|last=McMillen|first=Sally G.|title=Seneca Falls and the Origins of the Women's Rights Movement|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=NY|pages=??}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first [[women's rights]] convention, approved a "[[Declaration of Sentiments]]" authored by [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] that listed among the "injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward woman":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title= Declaration of Sentiments |last=Stanton |first=Elizabeth Cady |year=1848}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wellman|first1=Judith|title=The road to Seneca Falls : Elizabeth Cady Stanton and the First Woman's Rights Convention|date=2004|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana|isbn=9780252071737}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
He has made her, if married, in the eye of the law, civilly dead.
He has taken from her all right in property, even to the wages she earns.
He has so framed the laws of divorce, as to what shall be the proper causes of divorce, in case of separation, to whom the guardianship of the children shall be given; as to be wholly regardless of the happiness of the women—the law, in all cases, going upon a false supposition of the supremacy of a man, and giving all power into his hands.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Massachusetts===

[[Massachusetts]] passed its Married Women's Property Act on May 5, 1855. It allowed married women to own and sell real and personal property, control their earnings, to sue and to make wills.&lt;ref name=warren&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Joyce W.|title=Women, Money, and the Law: Nineteenth-Century Fiction, Gender, and the Courts|year=2005|publisher=University of Iowa Press|pages=51–3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JiCqDcS9aykC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other legislation enacted that year made divorce and remarriage easier, provided protections for divorced women, and removed the five-year waiting period before a wife could file for divorce on the grounds of desertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = John R. | last= Mulkern | title = The Know-Nothing Party in Massachusetts: The Rise and Fall of a People's Movement | publisher = Northeastern University Press | date= 1990 | page= 111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Jersey===

[[New Jersey]] passed a limited statute in 1852 and in 1874 another version that one historian described as "comprehensive and progressive".&lt;ref name=homestead244/&gt;

===California===

In an exception to the statutory expansion of the legal rights of married women, the [[Constitution of California|California Constitution]] of 1849, drawing on the community property tradition of Spanish [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] rather than the common law tradition, distinguished a wife's property from [[community property]]: "All property, both real and personal, of the wife, owned or claimed by her before marriage, and that acquired afterward by gift, devise, or descent, shall be her separate property; and laws shall be passed more clearly defining the rights of the wife in relation as well to her separate property, as to that held in common with her husband."&lt;ref name=loc /&gt;

==Outcomes and Backlash==

The movement to expand the property rights of married women did not go unchallenged. Virginia debated and rejected such legislation in the 1840s.&lt;ref name=mcmillen/&gt; In 1849, the [[Tennessee]] legislature stated, in one historian's account, "that married women lack independent souls and thus should not be allowed to own property."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heineman|first=Sue|title=Timelines of American Women's History |year=1996 |publisher=Berkley Publishing |location=NY|pages=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5kjkZjvnI-sC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York expanded its statute in 1860,&lt;ref name=homestead244&gt;{{cite book |last=Homestead |first=Melissa J.|title=American Women Authors and Literary Property, 1822-1869 |year=2005 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|location=NY|pages=244|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=36L3XxeevSEC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Married Women's Earnings Act.&lt;ref name=speth/&gt; It then repealed parts of its legislation in 1862, eliminating a married woman's right to guardianship of her children and the right of a widow to manage her late husband's estate.&lt;ref name=mcmillen/&gt;

As of 1860, 14 states had passed some version of this statute.&lt;ref&gt;Wilma Mankiller et al, eds., ''The Reader's Companion to U.S. Women's History'' (NY: Houghton Mifflin, 1998), 285, [https://books.google.com/books?id=d9lhBw8t410C&amp;pg=PA285&amp; available online], accessed February 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], 29 states had passed some version of a Married Women's Property Act.&lt;ref name=speth/&gt;

As the U.S. Congress considered legislation to protect the civil rights of African-Americans that became the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], opponents of the legislation charged that it would alter the legal status of married women. Senator Edgar Cowan, a supporter of the legislature ridiculed that suggestion: "What was the involuntary servitude mentioned there? ... Was it the right the husband had to the service of his wife? Nobody can pretend that those things were within the purview of that amendment; nobody believes it."&lt;ref name=warren/&gt;

In the years following the Civil War, [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] campaigned for the expansion of married women's rights, arguing in 1869 that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Homestead|first=Melissa J.|title=American Women Authors and Literary Property, 1822-1869|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=NY|pages=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=36L3XxeevSEC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|[T]he position of a married woman ... is, in many respects, precisely similar to that of the negro slave. She can make no contract and hold no property; whatever she inherits or earns becomes at that moment the property of her husband.... Though he acquired a fortune through her, or though she earn a fortune through her talents, he is the sole master of it, and she cannot draw a penny....[I]n the English common law a married woman is nothing at all. She passes out of legal existence.}}


The changing statutes and differences among the states complicated the situation of female authors. A married woman's right to contract with a publisher and to control what her writings earned depended on the state or states where she and her husband lived at the time.&lt;ref&gt;This subject and its complications are examined in Melissa J. Homestead, ''American Women Authors and Literary Property, 1822-1869'', passim.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1887, one-third of the states had not provided statutory protection for a married women to control her earnings.&lt;ref name=warren/&gt; Three states gave married women no legal status until late in the nineteenth century: [[Delaware]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name=warren/&gt; Even where statutes appeared to establish some measure of rights for a married women, courts interpreted statutes to her disadvantage and relied on common law whenever a statute was less than explicit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="909">The '''merger doctrine''' in [[civil procedure]] stands for the proposition that when litigants agree to a [[settlement (law)|settlement]], and then seek to have their settlement incorporated into a [[court order]], the court order actually extinguishes the settlement and replaces it with the authority of the court to supervise the behavior of the parties. Under this doctrine, the court is free to modify its order as necessary to achieve justice in the case, and may hold a party that breaches the agreement in [[contempt of court]].

The '''Natural Health Products Directorate''' (NHPD) is the division of the [[Health Products and Food Branch]] of [[Health Canada]] that is responsible for implementation of the Natural Health Product Regulations, including [[Good Manufacturing Practices]], for [[Natural Health Products]] for sale in Canada.

==Aspects==

As the regulatory authority for nutritionals, the NHPD controls two aspects of consumer and product safety and efficacy.

# The issuance of site licences, required for manufacturing facilities in Canada to produce nutritionals for sale in Canada.
# The issuance of Natural Health Product Numbers (NPNs), required for each nutritional marketed in Canada. Each product is evaluated for formulation, dosage requirements, label claims, safety, and proof of efficacy prior to granting an NPN.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19683">{{Net neutrality}}

The basic framework of '''[[net neutrality]] in the [[European Union]]''' (EU) is laid down by Article 3 of EU Regulation 2015/2120.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32015R2120&amp;rid=2|title=Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 laying down measures concerning open internet access and amending Directive 2002/22/EC on universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic communications networks and services and Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 on roaming on public mobile communications networks within the Union |accessdate=16 February 2016 |author=European Parliament and the Council of the European Union|date=25 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the regulation's text has been criticized as offering loopholes that can undermine the regulation's effectiveness.&lt;ref name=guardianeu&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hern|first1=Alex|title=EU net neutrality laws fatally undermined by loopholes, critics say|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/27/eu-net-neutrality-laws-fatally-undermined-by-loopholes-critics-say|accessdate=16 February 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=27 October 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213124554/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/27/eu-net-neutrality-laws-fatally-undermined-by-loopholes-critics-say|archivedate=13 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some EU member countries, such as [[Slovenia]] and the [[Netherlands]], have stronger net neutrality laws. 

==Regulation history==
The 2002 regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services in the European Union consisted of five directives, which are referred to as "the [[List of European Union directives#Electronic communication|Framework Directive and the Specific Directives]]":{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
* Access Directive (Directive 2002/19/EC)
* Authorization Directive (Directive 2002/20/EC)
* Framework Directive (Directive 2002/21/EC)
* [[Universal Service Directive]] (Directive 2002/22/EC)
* [[Directive on privacy and electronic communications]] (Directive 2002/58/EC)

When the [[European Commission]] consulted on the updating of the Framework Directive and the Specific Directives in November 2007, it examined the possible need for legislation to mandate network neutrality, countering the potential damage, if any, caused by non-neutral broadband access. The European Commission stated that prioritisation "is generally considered to be beneficial for the market so long as users have choice to access the transmission capabilities and the services they want" and "consequently, the current EU rules allow operators to offer different services to different customers groups, but not allow those who are in a dominant position to discriminate in an anti-competitive manner between customers in similar circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/library/proposals/1472/comm_pdf_sec_2007_1472_1_en_documentdetravail.pdf.pdf|title=Impact Assessment on the proposals to amend the European regulatory framework (Working Document – SEC(2007) 1472) |accessdate=26 December 2008 |author=European Commission |authorlink=European Commission |date=13 November 2007 |format=PDF |page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the European Commission highlighted that Europe's current legal framework cannot effectively prevent network operators from degrading their customers' services. Therefore, the European Commission proposed that it should be empowered to impose a minimum quality of services requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/library/proposals/698/com_2007_0698_en.pdf|title=Article 22 of the proposed Universal Service Directive|work=Digital Agenda for Europe|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, an obligation of transparency was proposed to limit network operators' ability to set up restrictions on end-users' choice of lawful content and applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/library/proposals/698/com_2007_0698_en.pdf|title=Article 20(5) of the proposed Universal Service Directive|work=Digital Agenda for Europe|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December 2009, the so-called "[[Telecoms Package]]" came into force and EU member states were required to implement the Directive by May 2011.&lt;ref name="Eur-Lex.Europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:FULL:EN:PDF |title=Eur-Lex.Europa.eu |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="businessweek1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Meyer |first=David |url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/may2009/gb2009057_886976.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index+-+temp_global+business |title=Europe Votes Sweeping Telecom Reform |work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |date=7 May 2009 |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the European Commission the new transparency requirements in the Telecoms Package would mean that "consumers will be informed—even before signing a contract—about the nature of the service to which they are subscribing, including traffic management techniques and their impact on service quality, as well as any other limitations (such as bandwidth caps or available connection speed)".&lt;ref name="businessweek1"/&gt; Regulation (EC) No 1211/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 established the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) and the Office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:FULL:EN:PDF |title=Eur-Les.Europa.eu |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Body of European Regulators of Electronic Communications]].

The [[European Parliament]] voted the EU Commission's September 2013 proposal on its first reading in April 2014 and the Council adopted a mandate to negotiate in March 2015. Following the adoption of the Digital Single Market Strategy by the Commission on 6 May, Heads of State and Government agreed on the need to strengthen the EU telecoms single market. After 18 months of negotiations, the European Parliament, Council and Commission reached two agreements on the end to roaming charges and on the first EU-wide rules on net neutrality on 30 June 2015,&lt;ref&gt;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-5275_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; to be completed by an  overhaul of EU telecoms rules in 2016.  Specifically, article 3 of EU Regulation 2015/2120&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32015R2120&amp;rid=2|title=Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 laying down measures concerning open internet access and amending Directive 2002/22/EC on universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic communications networks and services and Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 on roaming on public mobile communications networks within the Union |accessdate=16 February 2016 |author=European Parliament and the Council of the European Union |date=25 November 2015 |format=HTML }}&lt;/ref&gt; sets the basic framework for ensuring net neutrality across the entire [[European Union]]. However, the regulation's text has been criticized as offering loopholes that can undermine the regulation's effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hern|first1=Alex|title=EU net neutrality laws fatally undermined by loopholes, critics say|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/27/eu-net-neutrality-laws-fatally-undermined-by-loopholes-critics-say|accessdate=16 February 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National regulations===
The EU has laid down a framework on net neutrality, but some of [[Member state of the European Union|EU states]] have stronger laws nationally, or are discussing passing them. However [[Neelie Kroes]], former [[European Commissioner for Digital Agenda]], has asked "national legislators and regulators to wait for better evidence before regulating on an uncoordinated, country-by-country basis that slows down the creation of a [[Digital Single Market]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/archives/commission_2010-2014/kroes/en/blog/netneutrality.html&lt;/ref&gt;

| In Belgium, net neutrality was discussed in the [[Kamer van Volksvertegenwoordigers|parliament]] in June 2011. Three parties ([[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|CD&amp;V]], [[Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie|N-VA]] &amp; [[Parti Socialiste (België)|PS]]) jointly proposed a text to introduce the concept of net neutrality in the telecom law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dekamer.be/FLWB/PDF/53/1467/53K1467002.pdf proposition 53 1467/002] dekamer.be, 27 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

| In France, on 12 April 2011, the Commission for economic affairs of the French parliament approved the report of MP Laure de La Raudière ([[Union pour un Mouvement Populaire|UMP]]). The report contains&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/dossiers/neutralite_internet_reseaux.asp rapport de La Raudière] asseblee-nationale.fr, 27 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 9 proposals. Propositions n°1 &amp; 2 act on net neutrality.

| Under discussion
| In March 2009, the following bill was put forward: ''Proposta di legge dei senatori Vincenzo VITA (PD) e Luigi Vimercati (PD)'', "Neutralità Delle Reti, Free Software E Societa' Dell'informazione".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punto-informatico.it/2591643/PI/Interviste/ci-vuole-una-legge-rete.aspx |title=PI: Ci vuole una legge per la Rete |publisher=Punto-informatico.it |date=7 February 1996 |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Senator Vimercati in an interview said that he wants "to do something for the network neutrality" and that he was inspired by Lawrence Lessig, Professor at the Stanford Law School. Vimercati said that the topic is very hard, but in the article 3 there is a reference to the concept of neutrality regard the contents. It is also a problem of transparency and for the mobile connections: we need the minimum bandwidth to guarantee the service. We need some principle to defend the consumers. It's important that the consumer has been informed if he could not access all the Internet.

The bill refuses all the discrimination: related by the content, the service and the device. The bill is generally about Internet ("a statute for the Internet") and treat different topics like network neutrality, free software, giving an Internet access to everyone.

| Law passed 2012
| At the end of 2012, Slovenia legislated a law of electronic communication implementing a strong principle of net neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Uradni list Republike Slovenije|url = https://www.uradni-list.si/1/content?id=111442|website = www.uradni-list.si|accessdate = 2015-10-10|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151006163114/http://www.uradni-list.si/1/content?id=111442|archivedate = 6 October 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slovenia]] thus became the second country in Europe to enact a net neutrality law. The Government Agency for Communications, Networks and Services (AKOS) is enforcing the law and executes inspections. In January 2015 it found [[zero-rating]] infringements at the two largest mobile network providers, Telekom and Simobil (now A1).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AKOS: Telekom Slovenije in Simobil kršila nevtralnost interneta @ Slo-Tech|url = https://slo-tech.com/novice/t634024|website = slo-tech.com|access-date = 2016-01-14|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035044/https://slo-tech.com/novice/t634024|archivedate = 4 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February it found similar infringaments also at Amis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AKOS's decision no. 06101-1412/2014/4 of 20 February 2014|url = http://www.akos-rs.si/odlocba-06101-1412-2014-4|website = akos-rs.si|access-date = 2016-07-19|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160918014647/http://www.akos-rs.si/odlocba-06101-1412-2014-4|archivedate = 18 September 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now Simobil) and Tušmobil&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AKOS's decision no. 06101-1413/2014/4 of 20 February 2014|url = http://www.akos-rs.si/odlocba-06101-1413-2014-4|website = akos-rs.si|access-date = 2016-07-19|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160918010109/http://www.akos-rs.si/odlocba-06101-1413-2014-4|archivedate = 18 September 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now Telemach).

==Potential violations==
In 2007, [[Plusnet]] was using [[deep packet inspection]] to implement limits and differential charges for peer-to-peer, [[file transfer protocol]], and online game traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Anderson |first=Nate |url=https://arstechnica.com/hardware/news/2007/07/Deep-packet-inspection-meets-net-neutrality.ars/2 |title=Deep packet inspection meets 'Net neutrality, CALEA |website=Ars Technica |date=25 July 2007 |accessdate=23 June 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419235908/http://arstechnica.com/hardware/news/2007/07/Deep-packet-inspection-meets-net-neutrality.ars/2 |archivedate=19 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Plusnet#Deep packet inspection and bandwidth management|their network management philosophy]] was made clear for each package they sold, and was consistent between different websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.plus.net/support/broadband/speed_guide/traffic_management.shtml|website= PlusNet|title= Broadband All about traffic management|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141129021315/http://www.plus.net/support/broadband/speed_guide/traffic_management.shtml|archivedate= 29 November 2014|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Germany mobile device ISP's like Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone were offering services that seemed to affect net neutrality. The government agency overseeing the market (Bundesnetzagentur) stated, in general these plans are in alignment with net neutrality but forced the companies to adopt some changes. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/1.5342660|title=Behörde verlangt: Telekom muss „Stream On“-Tarif verändern|date=15 December 2017|publisher=|via=www.faz.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/netzneutralitaet-in-deutschland-auch-in-deutschland-ist-die-netzneutralitaet-durchloechert-1.3791748|title=Auch in Deutschland ist die Netzneutralität durchlöchert|first1=Mirjam|last1=Hauck|first2=Helmut|last2=Martin-Jung|date=17 December 2017|publisher=|via=Sueddeutsche.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
European net neutrality law has been criticised for leaving too many loopholes to be exploited, as amendments to close them failed to gain enough support across the [[European Parliament]]. Some loopholes include the ability to offer priority to "specialised services", provided they still treat the "open" internet equally. Such services included [[remote surgery]], [[driverless car]]s and anti-terrorism efforts. The law does say that these services cannot be offered if they restrict bandwidth for normal users. Another exemption is giving websites a "[[Zero-rating]]", not counting a website against a user's data limits, giving an advantage to those sites when being viewed via a metered connection.&lt;ref name=guardianeu/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4179">'''Operation Torpedo''' was a 2011 operation where the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] compromised three different hidden services hosting child pornography, which would then target anyone who happened to access them using a [[Network Investigative Technique|network investigative technique]] (NIT).

The operation started after Dutch police compromised a hidden service called Pedoboard, and found it was physically located at a Nebraska web hosting company.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.com/2014/08/operation-torpedo/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/25/technology/fbi-child-porn/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing FBI investigation found that an employee, Aaron McGrath, was operating two child pornography sites at his work and one at his home. After a year of surveillance, the FBI arrested McGrath and took control of his three sites (PedoBoard, PedoBook, TB2)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justice.gov/usao-ne/file/830846/download#page=25&lt;/ref&gt; for a two-week period starting in November 2012. During this time the websites were modified to serve up a [[Network Investigative Technique|network investigative technique]] (NIT), which would attempt to unmask visitors by revealing their IP address, operating system and web brower..

The NIT was successful in revealing approximately 25 domestic users as well as numerous foreign users.&lt;ref name=WiredDeFoggi&gt;https://www.wired.com/2014/08/federal-cybersecurity-director-guilty-child-porn-charges/&lt;/ref&gt;
The NIT code was revealed as part of the case ''USA v Cottom et al''. Researchers from [[University of Nebraska at Kearney]] and [[Dakota State University]] reviewed the NIT code and found that it was an [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] application that would ping a user's real IP address back to an FBI controlled server, rather than routing their traffic through the [[Tor network]] and protecting their identity. It used a technique from [[Metasploit]]'s "decloaking engine" and only affected users who had not updated their Tor web browser.&lt;ref&gt;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/07/feds-bust-through-huge-tor-hidden-child-porn-site-using-questionable-malware/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2124281-fbi-tor-busting-227-1.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://commons.erau.edu/adfsl/2016/wednesday/10/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.com/2014/12/fbi-metasploit-tor/&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation by [[Daily Dot]] claimed that the NIT was created by former part-time employee of Tor Project and [[Vidalia (software)|Vidalia]] developer Matthew Edman and was internally known as "Cornhusker".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/government-contractor-tor-malware/&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Department of Justice noted in December 2015 that besides McGrath, 18 users in the USA had been convicted as a result of the operation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/new-york-man-sentenced-six-years-prison-receiving-and-accessing-child-pornography&lt;/ref&gt; One user caught by the NIT had accessed the site for only nine minutes and had since wiped his computer, yet a months-later police search of his home and digital devices found (through [[digital forensics]]) image thumbnails indicating past presence of downloaded child pornography, as well as text instructions on accessing and downloading child pornography.&lt;ref&gt;https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-8th-circuit/1849706.html&lt;/ref&gt; Another user was unmasked through his messages with an undercover FBI agent, and this user turned out to be Timothy DeFoggi, who was at that time the Acting Director of Cybersecurity at the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]].&lt;ref name=WiredDeFoggi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-acting-hhs-cyber-security-director-sentenced-25-years-prison-engaging-child&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2736132/Former-HHS-cyber-security-chief-convicted-child-porn-case-government-payroll-EIGHT-MONTHS-indictment.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the Conservation of Cetaceans and their Habitats in the Pacific Island Region''' is a Multilateral Environmental [[Memorandum of Understanding]] concluded under the auspices of the [[Bonn Convention|Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS)]], also known as the [[Bonn Convention]], and in collaboration with the [[Pacific Regional Environment Programme|Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP)]]. The MoU provides an international framework for coordinated conservation efforts to improve the conservation status of the Pacific Islands Cetaceans and came into effect on 15 September 2006.

The MoU covers 22 range States (Australia, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Caledonia (to France), New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, United Kingdom (Pitcairn Island), United States (including American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands), Vanuatu and Wallis and Futuna (to France)). As of September 2012, 15 States have signed the MoU as well as a number of co-operating organisations.

Whales and dolphins ([[cetaceans]]) migrate over large distances, connecting ocean ecosystems and cultures throughout the [[Pacific Islands|Pacific Islands Region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/conservation/native-animals/marine-mammals/whales-in-the-south-pacific.pdf|format=PDF|title=Whales in the South Pacific|publisher=Doc.govt.nz|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite restrictions on commercial hunting imposed by the [[International Whaling Commission]], such as the international [[Whaling|moratorium on whaling]], populations have not recovered to pre-whaling levels and many species are listed in the highest risk categories of the [[IUCN Red List]]. To provide a framework for governments, scientists and other to monitor and co-ordinate conservation efforts, a MoU was launched on 15 September 2006.

Signatories to the Pacific Islands Cetaceans MoU:
* Australia (15 September 2006)
* Cook Islands (15 September 2006)
* Federated States of Micronesia (15 September 2006)
* Fiji (15 September 2006)
* France (15 September 2006)
* New Zealand (15 September 2006)
* Niue (15 September 2006)
* Samoa (15 September 2006)
* Vanuatu (15 September 2006)
* Papua New Guinea (6 March 2007)
* Solomon Islands (6 March 2007)
* United Kingdom, Pitcairn Island (29 July 2009)
* Tonga (9 September 2010)
* Tuvalu (9 September 2010)
* United States of America (27 September 2012)

In addition, the following organisations have signed the MoU:
* CMS Secretariat (15 September 2006)
* Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) Secretariat (15 September 2006)
* [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]] (15 September 2006)
* [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society]] (15 September 2006)
* [[WWF (conservation organization)|WWF International]] (6 March 2007)
* [[Whales Alive]] (29 July 2009)
* South Pacific Whale Research Consortium (29 July 2009)

Although most of the Signatories have only small land areas, they are of the highest importance since they are surrounded by huge [[Exclusive Economic Zones]], covering millions of square kilometres of sea, which the cetaceans use as migration routes.

== Aim of MoU ==
The survival of many cetacean populations that frequent the waters of the Pacific Islands Region, particularly those that have been severely depleted, can be affected by numerous threats, such as interaction with fisheries, hunting, pollution, collision with boats, noise, habitat degradation, climate change, disruption of food chains and irresponsible tourism. The aim of the MoU is to address all of these threats through co-operation between the range States.

== Species covered by MoU ==
The MoU protects all populations of [[cetaceans]] (whales and dolphins) in the [[Pacific Islands|Pacific Island Region]] (area between the Tropic of Cancer and 60° South latitude and between 130° east longitude and 120° West longitude). Some of the species occurring in the Pacific Islands Region are:[[File:Bottlenose Dolphin KSC04pd0178.jpg|thumb|300px|Bottlenose Dolphin]]
* [[Minke whales]]
* [[Sei whale]]
* "Bryde's-like" whales
* [[Blue whales]]
* [[Fin whale]]
* [[Humpback whale]]
* [[Pygmy killer whale]]
* [[Short-finned pilot whale]]
* [[Orca]]
* [[Striped dolphin]]
* [[Bottlenose dolphins]]
* [[Common dolphins]]
* [[Sperm whale]]

== Fundamental components ==
The Signatories acknowledge the shared responsibility of States, Territories, intergovernmental organisations and the non-governmental sector to achieve and maintain a favourable conservation status for cetaceans and their habitats in the Pacific Island Region. To this end, the Signatories decided to work closely together and to foster co-operation, build capacity and ensure coordinated region-wide actions. Therefore, they will, individually or collectively:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Text of Pacific Islands Cetaceans MoU|url=http://www.cms.int/species/pacific_cet/_CMS_Pacific_Cetaceans_MoU_E_amended.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Cms.int|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Take steps to conserve all cetaceans and fully protect species listed in CMS Appendix I that occur in the Pacific Islands Region
# Consider, as appropriate, ratifying or acceding to those biodiversity-related international instruments that complement the MoU
# Review, enact or update, as appropriate, legislation to conserve cetaceans
# Implement the provision of the Action Plan, annexed to the MoU as a basis to conserve all populations of cetaceans in the Pacific Islands Region
# Facilitate the rapid exchange of scientific, technical and legal information necessary to co-ordinate conservation measures and to co-operate with recognised experts, collaborating organisations and Territories concerned so as to facilitate the work conducted in relation to the Action Plan
# Assess the implementation of the MoU and Action Plan at regular meetings
# Provide the Secretariat a regular report on the implementation of the MoU

The MoU took effect immediately after the fourth signature (15 September 2006) and will remain in effect indefinitely subject to the right of any Signatory to terminate its participation by providing one year’s written notice to all other Signatories.

== Meetings ==
[[File:Second Meeting of Signatories to the Pacific Islands Cetaceans MoU.jpg|thumb|250px|Second Meeting of Signatories to the Pacific Islands Cetaceans MoU, Auckland, New Zealand, 28–29 July 2009]]
Meetings of Signatories are organised regularly to review the conservation status of the species and the implementation of the MoU and Action Plan. At the meetings there is also a possibility to sign the MoU.

'''The First Meeting of Signatories''' took place in [[Apia, Samoa]], 6 March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of First Meeting of Signatories|url=http://www.cms.int/species/pacific_cet/mtg1_rpt/Report_PIC_1st_Mtg_with_annexes.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Cms.int|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the meeting representative of two range States, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands, signed the MoU. Furthermore, the conservation status of the Pacific Islands Cetaceans was reviewed, as well as the implementation of the MoU and Action Plan. All the current Signatories were represented at the meeting. Non-Signatory range States present during the meeting were Tonga, Kiribati, Tuvalu and the United States as well as several NGO’s such as [[IFAW]] and [[WDCS]].[[File:Third Meeting of Signatories to the Pacific Islands Cetaceans Memorandum of Understanding.jpg|thumb|250px|Third Meeting of Signatories to the Pacific Islands Cetaceans MoU, Noumea, New Caledonia, 8 September 2012]]

'''The Second Meeting of Signatories''' was held in [[Auckland, New Zealand]], 28–29 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of Second Meeting of Signatories|url=http://www.cms.int/species/pacific_cet/2nd_Mtg_July09_NewZealand/report_inc_annexes.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Cms.int|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting the Pitcairn Islands, the South Pacific Whale Research Consortium and [[Whales Alive]] were added to the Signatories. A proposal, subject to funding, was endorsed to appoint an officier to be based at SPREP to co-ordinate the MoU and to be responsible for CMS activities throughout the region. Moreover, the meeting adopted a Whale and Dolphin Action Plan 2009–2012, based on a similar document developed by SPREP, as an Action Plan for the MoU. The plan emphasis on increasing capacity, awareness and understanding in the region. It outlines how communities can benefit from whale-and dolphin-based tourism. A proposal to develop an Oceania Humpback Whale Recovery Plan was also endorsed. Finally, a Technical Advisory Group for the MoU was formed, consisting of nine specialist experts in the science of cetacean conservation, coordinated with [[WDCS]].

'''The Third Meeting of Signatories''' took place in [[Noumea, New Caledonia]], 8 September 2012. The meeting focused on the following subjects:
* Adopt the SPREP regional Whale and Dolphin Action Plan 2013–2017 for the MoU
* Review the status of implementation of the MoU and Action Plan
* Set future priorities for the MoU
* Discuss strengthened collaboration at the national, regional and international level for the implementation of the MoU and Action Plan.

== Secretariat ==
The CMS Secretariat – located in [[Bonn]], Germany – acts as the secretariat to the MoU. The secretariat transmits reports received from Signatories to the other States, Territories concerned and any collaborating organisations together with an overview report that it compiles on the basis of the information at its disposal.

== Action plan ==
CMS's key partner SPREP developed a Whale and Dolphin Action Plan, which was adopted in 2003 and was revised in 2007. This plan was appended to the MoU and formed the basis for on-the-ground conservation efforts throughout the region. In 2009, at the Second Meeting of Signatories, an Amending Protocol was adopted which replaced the Action Plan 2003–2007 in Annex 2 to the MoU with the Whale and Dolphin Action Plan 2009–2012, which is based on the SPREP Whale and Dolphin Action Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Action Plan 2009–2012|url=http://www.cms.int/species/pacific_cet/actionplan_2009_2012.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Cms.int|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Action Plans focus on the following subjects:
* Threat reduction
* Habitat protection, including migratory corridors
* Research an monitoring
* Education and public awareness
* Information exchange
* Capacity building
* Responses to strandings and entanglements
* Sustainable and responsible cetacean-based tourism
* International co-operation

The Third Meeting of Signatories endorsed a recovery plan for the endangered humpback whale population in Oceania, and adopted a five-year Action Plan (2013–2017), previously adopted by SPREP members, for the MoU, outlining priorities for addressing threats, as well as increasing capacity and public awareness in the region.

== Activities and achievement ==
Implementation activities in different parts of the region have included:
* Research and survey work, including on entanglement of large whales in fishing gear and mitigation options. For example, the Fiji Humpback Research Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fiji Humpback Research Project|url=http://www.cms.int/species/pacific_cet/wdcs_fiji_survey_201009.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Cms.int|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assessment of the conservation status of cetaceans and the socio-economic value of cetacean conservation
* Interdepartmental collaboration over ship strikes and ocean noise
* New marine sanctuaries
* Development of the Pacific Islands Whale and Dolphin Watching Guidelines
* Capacity building workshops and development of licensing systems for whale watching operators
* Alignment of national legislation with the MoU

The [[Year of the Dolphin]] 2007–2008 campaign achieved a major outreach effort by CMS and its cetacean-related agreements worldwide.

The Government of Samoa, with co-funding from the CMS Secretariat, drawing on a voluntary contribution from Australia, conducted a cetacean survey in 2010 which confirmed the importance of Samoan waters for Humpback whales and other Cetacean species such as Spinner dolphins.

== Pacific Islands Cetaceans MoU Diversity Database ==
As part of the Partnership Agreement between WDCS and CMS an online Diversity Database was developed and is now fully online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.int/news/PRESS/nwPR2011/08_aug/nw_090811_pacific_database.htm|title=News|publisher=Cms.int|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This multilingual tool makes Country/Territory and species specific information freely and easily available to all Pacific Islands Governments, tracking information like habitat type, behaviour during the sighting, number of animals per sighting and any threats that might be related if the sighting is a stranding. CMS and [[CITES]] Appendices listings are also noted, as well as meeting reports and photos if available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pacific Islands Cetaceans MoU Diversity Database|url=http://www.pacificcetaceans.org/diversity.php|publisher=Pacificcetaceans.org|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''plea in equity''', in the [[common law]], is a statement of facts raised by a defendant which operates as a defense to an equitable claim raised by the plaintiff. Traditionally, the plea is required to state new facts, additional to those set forth in the plaintiff's [[bill in equity]], and these facts must support a dispositive defense to the claim such as the passage of a [[statute of limitations]], plaintiff's prior [[waiver]] or [[Settlement (law)|settlement]] of the claim, or ''[[res judicata]]''.

In the [[United States]], the legal and equitable jurisdiction of most courts has been merged, and the plea in equity has been abolished. However, it remains a valid plea in certain states. In [[Virginia]], a plea in equity may still be filed, and such a filing entitles ''either party'' to request a [[jury trial]] to decide the facts alleged in the plea.

}}'''''R v Heywood''''' 1994 3 S.C.R. 761 is a leading [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on the concept of [[fundamental justice]] in [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section seven]] of the Charter. The Court found that section 179(1)(b) of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] for [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] was overbroad and thus violated section 7 and could not be saved under section 1.

==Background==
In 1987, Heywood was convicted under section 246.1(1) (now s. 271(1)) of the Criminal Code for sexual assault of children. The conviction made him subject to section 179(1)(b) which prevented certain convicted individuals from [[loitering]].

In July 1989, Heywood was arrested in [[Beacon Hill Park]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] for loitering "at or near a playground" under section 179(1). He had been spotted several times previously near the playground carrying a camera with a telephoto lens. Upon arrest the police got a search warrant and found collections of pictures of children at play.

At trial, Heywood argued that the law violated section 7, 11(d), 12, and 15 of the Charter. The court found a violation of 7 and 11(d) which was justified under section 1. Heywood was convicted. On appeal to the Supreme Court of the province, then to the provincial Court of Appeal the conviction was upheld.  Finally, the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed the violations of section 7 and 11(d) but also found that they could not be saved under section 1, and so the conviction was overturned.

==Reasons of the court==
In a 5 to 4 decision, the Court dismissed the appeal, finding a section 7 violation that could not be saved. The majority was written by Cory J. with Lamer C.J., Sopinka, Iacobucci, and Major JJ. concurring.

The case turned on the interpretation of the word "[[Loitering|loiter]]" in section 179(1)(b) which states:
:''179. (1) Every one commits vagrancy who ...
::''(b) having at any time been convicted of an offence under section ... section 271..., is found loitering in or near a school ground, playground, public park or bathing area.''

Cory states that the word should be given its ordinary, dictionary meaning, which is "to stand idly around, hang around, linger, tarry, saunter, delay, dawdle", and it does not contain any element of malevolent intent. He further claims that such a meaning supports the purpose of the section to protect children. "Malevolent intent" - a lesser degree of intent than unlawful intent - is too broad, vague, and subjective, says Cory.

Given this interpretation, Cory finds that the law infringes the principles of [[fundamental justice]] as it is more restrictive than necessary and applies too broadly. That is, "without prior notice to the accused, to too many places, to too many people, for an indefinite period with no possibility of review".

==Dissent==
The dissent, written by Gonthier J., with La Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, and McLachlin JJ. concurring, found that the word "loiter" required an element of "malevolent intent" and therefore was not overbroad and did not violate section 7.

'''Raelyn Campbell''' is Senior Program Officer for the Asia-Pacific Region at the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcie.org/researchpdfs/newshimoda/Roundtable_summary.pdf US-Japan Relations in an Era of New Challenges] U.S.-Japan Council, Japan Center for International Exchange, April 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; directing the Foundation’s engagement with the region, including innovative financing partnerships to support global immunization campaigns&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jica.go.jp/english/news/press/2011/110818.html&lt;/ref&gt; and global health R&amp;D.&lt;ref&gt;https://ghitfund.org/about/mediacenter/pressdetail/detail/24&lt;/ref&gt;

In her personal life, she has been involved in two high-profile lawsuits - one a criminal case in Japan, after being the victim of sexual assault, and the other a civil case in the United States, involving a computer of hers that had disappeared.

In 1998, Campbell was the victim of a sexual attack in Japan. Her pursuit of justice as a result of this attack received significant coverage in English and Japanese-language press in Japan and North America.

In 2007, she filed a $54 million civil lawsuit against [[Best Buy]] for having lost her computer, which, she said, contained important identity information.  This legal action also received extensive media coverage, including an appearance she made on ''[[The Today Show]]'', in 2008.&lt;ref name="voices.washingtonpost"&gt;[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/rawfisher/2008/02/another_54_million_lawsuit_no.html Fisher, Marc. "Another $54 Million Lawsuit: No Pants This Time"] The Washington Post, February 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="startribune"&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/business/15571092.html Crosby, Jackie. "Lost laptop?

Campbell's writings have appeared in ''[[The Japan Times]]''&lt;ref name="japantimes"&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/eo20011205a1.html Campbell, Raelyn. "Show North Koreans the carrot as well as the stick"] The Japan Times, December 5, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Japan Policy Research Institute ''Critique''''.&lt;ref name="jpri"&gt;[http://www.jpri.org/publications/critiques/critique_VI_2.html Campbell. Raelyn. "Raped (by the Cops) in Tokyo"] Japan Policy Research Institute Critique, Vol. VI No. 2 (February 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pursuit of victims' rights law in Japan after victimized in sexual assault==
According to news reports, Campbell was attacked in Tokyo in a sexual assault in 1998.&lt;ref name="geocities"&gt;[http://www.geocities.co.jp/Playtown-Denei/3053/990328jat.html Jeffs, Angela. "Assaulted woman calls for a victims' rights law"] The Japan Times, March 28, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; She freed herself from her attacker, who then fled. She pursued him and managed to bring him to her landlord's office. Police were called and she filed a report. The police dragged their feet for months, until later, when in an appearance at the [[Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan]], Campbell held a news conference, during which she called for a victim's rights law in Japan.&lt;ref name="geocities" /&gt; The story was then reported by news organizations such as [[The Associated Press]], and appeared in publications such as the [[Los Angeles Times]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jan/16/news/mn-54485 Prideaux, Eric. "In Japan, Sex-Crime Victims Endure in Silence"] Los Angeles Times/Associated Press, January 16, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Toronto Star]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geocities.co.jp/Playtown-Denei/3053/000219star.html Prideaux, Eric. "SEXUAL ASSAULTS DIRTY SECRET IN JAPAN"] The Toronto Star/AP Wire Service, February 19, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, her attacker was convicted of sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20080318zg.html Fox, Michael H. "Victim alleges coverup after key evidence of attack destroyed, lost"] The Japan Times, March 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit against Best Buy==
In 2007 Campbell filed a $54 million lawsuit against Best Buy after the company told her that the computer she had brought in to be repaired (which she said contained important identity information, such as tax records) was lost. She said she had spent months trying to find out the status of the computer and was given conflicting reports by numerous Best Buy employees.&lt;ref name="arstechnica"&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/security/news/2008/02/victim-54-million-best-buy-lawsuit-stupid-but-necessary.ars Cheng, Jacqui. "Victim: $54 million Best Buy lawsuit stupid, but necessary"] arstecnica.com, February, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Many writers following her lawsuit dismissed her case as frivolous, but some in blog posts (such as one in [[The Washington Post]]) expressed sympathy for Campbell and supported her attempts to draw attention to consumer rights.&lt;ref name="voices.washingtonpost" /&gt; Campbell indicated that she chose the figure because a Washington, D.C. judge, Roy Pearson, had sued a dry cleaners for the same amount after the business had lost a pair of his pants. She said she never expected to receive the amount she sued for, but wanted to bring attention to the case.&lt;ref name="voices.washingtonpost" /&gt;&lt;ref name="startribune" /&gt;&lt;ref name="msnbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arstechnica" /&gt;

According to an April 30, 2008 post on the website pointoflaw.com, Campbell's case was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pointoflaw.com/archives/2008/04/this-54-million-lawsuit-agains.php posted by Wood, Carter. "That $54 Million Lawsuit Against Best Buy, Dismissed..."] pointoflaw.com, Information and opinion on the U.S. litigation system, April 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
Campbell's writings include her observations on her experiences in Japan as well as on world affairs, including her efforts in attempting to eradicate polio.&lt;ref name="japantimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jpri" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.impatientoptimists.org/Posts/2011/10/From-the-Tokyo-Tower-to-the-End-of-Polio Campbell, Raelyn.

[[File:Lab animal care.jpg|thumb|Lab animal care]]
In [[New Zealand]], animals are used in many situations for [[animal research|research]], [[animal testing|testing]] and teaching – commonly referred to as RTT.

Animal use in RTT is strictly controlled under the [[Animal Welfare Act 1999]]&lt;ref name=AWA /&gt;  and organisations using animals must follow an approved code of ethical conduct.&lt;ref name=CEC /&gt; This sets out the policies and procedures that need to be adopted and followed by the organisation and its [[animal ethics]] committee (AEC).&lt;ref name=AEC /&gt; Every project must be approved and monitored by an AEC which includes lay members. The principles of the [[The Three Rs (animals)|Three Rs]]&lt;ref name=NC3Rs /&gt; are embodied in the Animal Welfare Act, the operation of all AECs, and all activities that involve the use of animals in research.

== Introduction ==

In New Zealand, it is legal under the Animal Welfare Act 1999 (the Act)&lt;ref name=AWA&gt;{{cite web|last=Ministry for Primary Industries|title=Guide to the Animal Welfare Act 1999: Table of Contents|url=http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/legislation/animal-welfare-act/guide/index.htm|work=Guide to the Animal Welfare Act 1999|publisher=Ministry for Primary Industries|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to use animals for research, testing and teaching (RTT) purposes. However, because the nature of this work may, in some cases, mean that potential benefits to humans, other animals or the environment may result in some harm to animals, such use carries significant responsibilities and strict legislative obligations.

== Statistics ==

The Ministry for Primary Industries reported that 310,287 animals were used in New Zealand in 2014.&lt;ref name=SR2014&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand publishes 2014 statistics on animal research|url=https://speakingofresearch.com/2016/02/16/new-zealand-publishes-2014-statistics-on-animal-research/|website=Speaking of Research|accessdate=14 October 2016|date=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common species used were cattle (24.3%), mice (18.8%), sheep (14.4%), fish (13.3%), birds (10.2%) and deer (8.1%). The large number of livestock used in research reflects the large amount of agricultural research conducted in New Zealand.

The most common areas of research were 'Basic biological research' (24.3%), 'veterinary research' (19.2%), 'teaching' (16.9%) and 'animal husbandry' (15.4%). According to the Ministry for Primary Industries, only 24% of animals die, or are euthanised, as part of the research. 1.9% of animals used in 2014 were transgenic.&lt;ref name=SR2014 /&gt;

== Legislation ==

Part 6 of the Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ministry for Primary Industries|title=Use Of Animals In Research, Testing &amp; Teaching (RTT)|url=http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/legislation/animal-welfare-act/guide/index.htm#useanimals|work=Guide to the Animal Welfare Act 1999|publisher=Ministry for Primary Industries|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; applies specifically to the use of animals for RTT purposes.

Under the Act:

* Any person or organisation wishing to manipulate animals for RTT purposes must do so under a Code of Ethical Conduct (CEC)&lt;ref name="CEC"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ministry for Primary Industries|title=Guide to the Preparation of Codes of Ethical Conduct|url=http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/animal-welfare/naeac/papers/naeaccec.htm|publisher=Ministry for Primary Industries|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  approved by the Director-General of the [[Ministry for Primary Industries (New Zealand)|Ministry for Primary Industries]] (MPI),&lt;ref name="MPI"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ministry for Primary Industries|title=Ministry for Primary Industries|url=http://www.mpi.govt.nz/|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and must establish an animal ethics committee (AEC)&lt;ref name="AEC"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ministry for Primary Industries|title=Animals in Research|url=http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/regs/animal-welfare/research|publisher=Ministry for Primary Industries|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to oversee the use of animals within the institution.
* The CEC sets out the policies and procedures to ensure that its AEC can operate effectively and that the organisation can meet its obligations under the Act.
* The membership of the AEC is set within the legislation and must include three members whose independence from the organisation adds credibility and transparency to the AEC’s activities. These include:
 
:* a nominee of an approved animal welfare organisation (such as the [[Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|SPCA]]&lt;ref name=SPCA&gt;{{cite web|last=SPCA New Zealand|title=SPCA|url=http://rnzspca.org.nz/|publisher=SPCA|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;);
:* a nominee of the New Zealand Veterinary Association;&lt;ref name=NZVA&gt;{{cite web|last=NZVA|title=New Zealand Veterinary Association|url=http://www.nzva.org.nz/|publisher=NZVA|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
:* a layperson to represent the [[public interest]] and who is nominated by a local government body.
* Animal ethics committees monitor researchers and the animal use that they have approved.&lt;ref name=monitoring&gt;{{cite web|last=National Animal Ethics Advisory Committee|title=Monitoring methods for animal ethics committees|url=http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/files/regs/animal-welfare/pubs/naeac/occasional-paper-5.pdf|publisher=NAEAC|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Organisations using animals for RTT must undergo an independent audit at a maximum of every five years to ensure compliance with the Act and with their own CEC.
* Records must be kept for all animals used for the purposes of RTT for five years. Code holders are required to submit an annual return, which includes the number of animals used and the impact on their welfare. The statistics supplied to [[Ministry for Primary Industries (New Zealand)|MPI]] are published each year as an appendix to the National Animal Ethics Advisory Committee (NAEAC)&lt;ref name=NAEAC&gt;{{cite web|last=NAEAC|title=National Animal Ethics Advisory Committee (NAEAC)|url=http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/regs/animal-welfare/nz/naeac|publisher=NAEAC|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; annual report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Animal Ethics Advisory Committee|title=NAEAC Annual Reports|url=http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/regs/animal-welfare/naeac/annual-reports|publisher=NAEAC|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Three Rs ==
{{main article|The Three Rs (animals)}}
The Three Rs&lt;ref name=NC3Rs&gt;{{cite web|last=National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research|title=NC3Rs|url=http://www.nc3rs.org.uk/|publisher=NC3Rs|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  – Replacement, Reduction and Refinement – relate to the ethical use of animals in RTT. 
* '''Replacement''' - wherever possible, animals should be replaced with non-animal alternatives e.g. computer modelling.
* '''Reduction''' – numbers of animals should be the minimum necessary to achieve a meaningful result.
* '''Refinement''' - pain and distress should be reduced as much as possible e.g. by using painkillers, by ensuring appropriate housing or by ensuring the skill of those involved in the use and care of animals.

The importance of the Three Rs is demonstrated by the New Zealand Three Rs Programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Massey University|title=NZ-3Rs Programme|url=http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/learning/departments/institute-veterinary-animal-biomedical-sciences/research/animal-welfare-science-and-bioethics-centre/promoting-responsible-animal-based-science/new-zealand-3rs-programme.cfm|publisher=Massey University|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collaboration between the [[Massey University]] Animal Welfare Science and Bioethics Centre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Massey University|title=Animal Welfare Science and Bioethics Centre|url=http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/learning/departments/institute-veterinary-animal-biomedical-sciences/research/animal-welfare-science-and-bioethics-centre/animal-welfare-science-and-bioethics-centre_home.cfm|publisher=Massey University|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ministry for Primary Industries (New Zealand)|MPI]],&lt;ref name=MPI /&gt; the Australian and New Zealand Council for the Care of Animals in Research and Teaching (ANZCCART)&lt;ref name=ANZCCART&gt;{{cite web|last=Royal Society of New Zealand|title=Australian and New Zealand Council for the Care of Animals in Research and Teaching (ANZCCART)|url=http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/organisation/panels/anzccart/|publisher=Royal Society of New Zealand|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and NAEAC.  The key aims of the Programme are:

* to promote understanding and application of the Three Rs in New Zealand;
* to encourage new Three Rs strategies in New Zealand;
* to profile New Zealand’s Three Rs contributions nationally and internationally
* to network and liaise with other Three Rs centres internationally

The Three Rs have been incorporated into New Zealand’s legislation as can be seen in the following section on AEC considerations.

== Animal ethics committees ==

The legislation requires that AEC members consider any RTT project using animals. Their questions must include the following:

* Are the scientific or educational objectives credible?
* What is the potential harm to the animals and how can it be minimised (refinement)?
* Is the experimental design credible?
* Are animals necessary and, if so, is the choice of species appropriate (replacement)?
* Can a less sentient species be used?
* Are the animal numbers the minimum necessary to get a meaningful result (reduction)?
* What procedures are in place to care for the animals (refinement)?
* Are those involved in the project suitably qualified (refinement)?
* What measures have been taken to ensure that experimental work is not being duplicated (reduction)?

In considering projects, AECs may approve the work, they may require certain conditions to be put in place before approval is granted, or they may reject the proposal. They are also required to monitor compliance with any approved project,&lt;ref name=monitoring /&gt; and can suspend or revoke the approval if necessary.

== The National Animal Ethics Advisory Committee ==

The National Animal Ethics Advisory Committee (NAEAC)&lt;ref name=NAEAC /&gt;  claims to be an independent committee whose membership includes animal welfare experts, veterinarians, scientists and lay people. It claims to provide independent, expert advice to the [[Ministry for Primary Industries (New Zealand)|Minister for Primary Industries]] on policy and practices relating to the use of animals in RTT. The committee also provides advice and support to AECs to maximise good decision-making. Assistance is provided in the following ways:

* AEC workshops;
* provision of induction packs for new AEC members;
* publication of policies and procedures;
* distribution of newsletters;
* response to queries from AECs;
* publication of an ‘occasional paper’ series on issues of importance to AECs;
* visits to regional AECs.

NAEAC also presents an annual "Three Rs Award" which recognises achievement in implementation of the Three Rs by an individual or organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ministry for Primary Industries|title=Three Rs Award|url=http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/regs/animal-welfare/research#three-rs-award|publisher=Ministry for Primary Industries|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''regulation of sport''' is usually done by a [[sport governing body]] for each [[sport]], resulting in a core of relatively invariant, agreed [[Game#Rules|rules]]. People responsible for [[leisure]] activities often seek recognition and respectability as sports by joining [[sports federation]]s such as the [[International Olympic Committee]], or by forming their own regulatory body.  In this way sports evolve from leisure activity to more formal sports: relatively recent newcomers are BMX [[cycling]], [[snowboarding]], [[wrestling]],  etc. Some of these activities have been popular but uncodified pursuits for different lengths of time. Indeed, the formal regulation of sport is a relatively modern and increasing development. This method promotes a sport globally, in a very successful way. It also promotes the universality of each sport, by ensuring that the same gameplay rules are being practiced worldwide, using a standardized/homogenous international gameplay rule system (sanctioned by the respective international sports governing bodies) that is applied uniformly on all member associations and recognized leagues. Examples are [[FIFA]] in association football and [[FIBA]] in basketball, which have regulated international gameplay rules that are even practiced within US sports leagues today, despite not practicing them historically (which therefore meant that many US sports leagues weren't recognized by international governing bodies in the past, until they began to adopt international rules). In the sport of basketball the defender/defense cannot call foul.

[[Formula One]] motor racing is an example of strict and changing regulation, where the regulating body appears to control rather than to simply define the sport. There have been major changes in the rules of F1 recently, almost on an annual basis, and more are planned. Sometimes this is done for safety reasons, sometimes to make the racing more interesting as a [[spectator sport]], and sometimes to promote [[competition]] through involvement of smaller [[team]]s. Some changes make overtaking more probable for example or reduce the probability of an overwhelming [[technology|technical]] advantage by any one team. Although heavily regulated, most people agree that the sport has thereby greatly benefitted, not least through dramatic leaps in [[safety]].

The degree of organisation can vary from national or worldwide  competitions for the sport, or it can occur in a  purely ''ad hoc'', spontaneous way. A sport may be played individually (e.g. time trialling in cycling) or in a team,  or just for recreation and well being (e.g. swimming).

Some challenging situations have had to be dealt with when  there is an overlap of the regulation of the sport  with other forms of regulation, e.g. safety (There have been serious losses of life in football audiences, through stand collapses or poor crowd management), or simple laws of the land (Some inadvertent or otherwise physical interchanges occur between participants: when is it acceptable for the sport regulating authority alone to investigate and if necessary punish these? Can there be economic or public relations pressures affecting these issues?)

The [[broadcasting of sports events]] is also highly regulated, with contracts limiting who can show footage.

A '''run-around coil''' is a type of [[energy recovery]] [[heat exchanger]] most often positioned within the supply and exhaust air streams of an air handling system, or in the exhaust gases of an industrial process, to recover the heat energy. Generally, it refers to any intermediate stream used to transfer heat between two streams that are not directly connected for reasons of safety or practicality. It may also be referred to as a '''run-around loop''', a '''pump-around coil''' or a '''liquid coupled heat exchanger'''.&lt;ref&gt;D. A. REAY (1980), A Review of Gas–Gas Heat Recovery Systems, Heat Recovery Systems, Volume 1, No. 1, Pergamon Press Ltd., pgs 18 – 21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
A typical run-around coil system comprises two or more multi-row finned tube coils connected to each other by a pumped pipework circuit. The pipework is charged with a heat exchange fluid, normally water, which picks up heat from the exhaust air coil and  gives up heat to the supply air coil before returning again. Thus heat from the exhaust air stream is transferred through the pipework coil to the circulating fluid, and then from the fluid through the pipework coil to the supply air stream.

The use of this system is generally limited to situations where the air streams are separated and no other type of device can be utilised since the heat recovery efficiency is lower than other forms of air-to-air heat recovery. Gross efficiencies are usually in the range of 40 to 50%, but more significantly seasonal efficiencies of this system can be very low, due to the extra electrical energy used by the pumped fluid circuit.

The fluid circuit, as well as containing the circulating pump, will also contain an expansion vessel, to accommodate changes in fluid pressure; a fill device, to ensure the system remains charged; controls to bypass and shut down the system when not required, and various other safety devices and ancillaries. Pipework runs should be kept as short as possible and should be sized for low velocities to keep frictional losses to a minimum, and hence reduce pump energy consumption. It is possible however to recover some of this energy in the form of heat given off by the motor if a glandless pump is used, where a water jacket surrounds the motor stator, thus water passing through the pump will pick up some of its heat.

The pumped fluid will have to be protected from freezing in certain climates, and as such is normally treated with a [[glycol]] based anti-freeze. This also reduces the specific heat capacity of the fluid and increases the viscosity, increasing pump power consumption, further reducing the seasonal efficiency of the device. For example, a 20% glycol mixture will provide protection down to {{convert|-10|C|F|abbr=on}},  but will increase system resistance by 15%.

For the finned tube coil design, there is a performance maximum corresponding to an eight- or ten-row coil, above this the fan and pump motor energy consumption increases substantially and seasonal efficiency starts to drop off. The main cause of increased energy consumption lies with the fan, for the same [[face velocity]], fewer coil rows will decrease air pressure drop and increase water pressure drop but the total energy consumption will usually be less than that for a greater number of coil rows with higher air pressure drops and lower water pressure drops.

==Energy transfer process==
Normally the heat transfer between airstreams provided by the device is termed as '[[Sensible heat|sensible]]', which is the exchange of energy, or [[enthalpy]], resulting in a change in temperature of the medium (air in this case), but with no change in moisture content.

==Other types of air-to-air heat exchangers==
*[[Thermal wheel]], or rotary heat exchanger (including enthalpy wheel and desiccant wheel)
*[[Recuperator]], or cross plate heat exchanger
*[[Heat pipe]]

{{cite CanLII|litigants='''Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission v Whatcott'''|year=2013|court=scc|num=11}} is a [[Canadian constitutional law]] case concerning the constitutionality of the hate speech provision in Saskatchewan's human rights legislation.

== Background ==
Four complainants brought an application to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission receiving flyers entitled "Keep Homosexuality out of Saskatoon's Public Schools!" and "Sodomites in our Public Schools" from Christian anti-homosexual activist [[Bill Whatcott]].&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite web |url= |title=Top court upholds key part of Sask. anti-hate law |date=27 February 2013 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |access-date=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complainants alleged a violation of section 14 of ''The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code'' (''SHRC''), which prohibits "publication or display of any representation that exposes or tends to expose to hatred, ridicules, belittles or otherwise affronts the dignity of any person or class of persons on the basis of a prohibited ground".&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual orientation was one such prohibited ground. A Saskatchewan human rights tribunal heard the case, holding that the contents of each flyer objectively contravened section 14 of the ''SHRC'', and that the provision did not unreasonably restrict Whatcott's [[Section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 2(b) ''Charter'' rights]].&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; The Tribunal prohibited Whatcott from further distributing the flyers and awarded compensation to the complainants.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon [[judicial review]] to the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench in 2007, the trial judge upheld the Tribunal's findings with respect to the violation of section 14 of the ''SHRC'' and its constitutionality.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the case was appealed to the [[Saskatchewan Court of Appeal]]. The court held that the tribunal and the trial judge had erred by considering only certain phrases from the flyers and that the flyers were not a prohibited hate publication.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 15–18&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Reasons of the SCC ==

26 third parties acted as [[Intervention (law)|intervenors]] during oral hearings in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawnow.org/whatcott-case-balancing-free-speech-social-harmony/#1 |title=The Whatcott Case: Balancing Free Speech and Social Harmony |last1=Bowal |first1=Peter |last2=McKay |first2=Colin |date=7 July 2014 |website=LawNow |publisher=CLPLEA |access-date=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marshall Rothstein|Rothstein J]] wrote the reasons for a unanimous Supreme Court.

=== Defining "hatred" ===

Rothstein J began by considering the definition of "hatred" as contemplated in ''R v Taylor'', where the Supreme Court had found that "hatred" as used in the ''[[Canadian Human Rights Act]]'' "refers to unusually strong and deep-felt emotions of detestation, calumny and vilification".&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Rothstein J identified two primary difficulties arising alongside the ''Taylor'' hatred doctrine; namely, that hatred is inherently subjective, which could conflict with the court's attempt at objectivity, and that it could lead to a "mistaken propensity to focus on the ideas being expressed, rather than on the ''effect'' of the expression".&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 31&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these criticisms, Rothstein J adapted the ''Taylor'' standard by holding that it should be conducted objectively, that "hatred" should be interpreted as "extreme manifestations of the emotion described by the words 'detestation' and 'vilification'",&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 57&lt;/ref&gt; a threshold which would not include merely repugnant or offensive expression, and that tribunals should consider the effect of the expression, not its inherent offensiveness.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 56–59&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freedom of expression analysis ===

Rothstein J next analyzed the constitutionality of section 14(1)(b) of the ''SHRC'', applying the correctness [[standard of review]].&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; Rothstein J held that the expression was protected by section 2(b) of the ''Charter'', and proceeded to conduct a [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1]] [[R v Oakes|''Oakes'' test]]. Rothstein J described the purpose of the legislation as "reducing the harmful effects and social costs of discrimination by tackling certain causes of discriminatory activity",&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 71&lt;/ref&gt; noting its emotional and societal effects on vulnerable groups&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 74&lt;/ref&gt; and its ability to impede democratic discussion.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Rothstein J found that the provision was prescribed by law and that its objective was pressing and substantial.

==== Rational connection ====

Next, Rothstein J considered whether the section 14(1)(b) limitation on free expression was rationally connected to the legislation's purpose. Rothstein J wrote that such expression "must seek to marginalize the group by affecting its social status and acceptance in the eyes of the majority"&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 80&lt;/ref&gt; in order for a rational connection to exist. Since section 14(1)(b) only captured hate speech communicated in public, and since it applied only to expression based on existing prohibited grounds of discrimination,&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Rothstein J found that the provision was rationally connected to the legislative objective. However, Rothstein J found that the wording "ridicules, belittles or otherwise affronts the dignity of" contained in section 14(1)(b) of the ''SHRC'' was constitutionally invalid, since the threshold set by that language was too low and thus did not align with the legislation's purpose.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 92&lt;/ref&gt; The offending words were removed from the section.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Minimal impairment ====

Rothstein J then considered whether the provision minimally impaired the impugned right to freedom of expression. Rothstein J answered affirmatively, holding that alternative measures, including a "marketplace of ideas" and an expanded role for the criminal law in hate speech cases, would not achieve the legislative objective, or would only achieve it ineffectively.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 102–105&lt;/ref&gt; Rothstein J held also that the provision was not overbroad once the language "ridicules, belittles or otherwise affronts the dignity of" was removed.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Rothstein J rejected Whatcott's argument that the expression at issue was protected because it was political in nature:

{{cquote|[120] In my view, s. 14 of the ''Code'' provides an appropriate means by which to protect almost the entirety of political discourse as a vital part of freedom of expression. It extricates only an extreme and marginal type of expression which contributes little to the values underlying freedom of expression and whose restriction is therefore easier to justify.}}

Rothstein J also rejected Whatcott's submission that his expression was protected because it differentiated between homosexual orientation and activity. Instead, Rothstein J held that "attacks on conduct [that is a crucial aspect of the identity of the vulnerable group] stand as a proxy for attacks on the group itself".&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Rothstein J also rejected arguments that the ''SHRC'' was overbroad because it did not require proof of intent or harm and because it did not offer any defences. Rothstein J instead wrote that the analysis must focus on the effects of the impugned expression, not the communicator’s intent,&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 127&lt;/ref&gt; that the legislature is "entitled to a reasonable apprehension of societal harm as a result of hate speech",&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 135&lt;/ref&gt; and that the absence of defences in the ''SHRC'' was not determinative; truthful statements or sincerely held beliefs do not affect the analysis, which must be undertaken from an objective standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Benefits and deleterious effects ====

Rothstein J found that the benefits of the section 14(1)(b) prohibition on hate speech outweighed the "detrimental effect of restricting expression which, by its nature, does little to promote the values underlying freedom of expression".&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freedom of religion analysis ===

Next, Rothstein J considered whether section 14(1)(b) of the ''SHRC'' infringed the freedom of religion enshrined in section 2(a) of the ''Charter''. Rothstein J concluded that section 2(a) had been infringed because Whatcott had a sincere religious belief and since section 14(1)(b) would significantly interfere with his ability to communicate his sincerely held beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par 154–156&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rothstein J found that the infringement was justified under section 1 of the ''Charter'', but again held that the wording "ridicules, belittles or otherwise affronts the dignity of" was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application ===

Rothstein J held that the standard of review of the Tribunal's decision was reasonableness, based on the Court's reasoning in ''[[Dunsmuir v New Brunswick]]''.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 167–168&lt;/ref&gt; Rothstein found that the Tribunal's decision to read certain parts of the flyer in isolation was reasonable, since "even one phrase or sentence... found to bring the publication, as a whole, in contravention of the ''Code''... precludes publication of the flyer in its current form".&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Rothstein J also held that the Tribunal's application of section 14(1)(b) to two of Whatcott's flyers (Flyers D and E) was reasonable, since those flyers portrayed the targeted group "as a menace that could threaten the safety and well-being of others",&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 187&lt;/ref&gt; objectively depicted them as "inferior [and] untrustworthy",&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 188&lt;/ref&gt; "[vilified] those of same-sex orientation by portraying them as  them as child abusers or predators",&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 189&lt;/ref&gt; and called for discrimination against the portrayed group.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Rothstein J found that the Tribunal's decision with respect to two other flyers (Flyers F and G) was unreasonable, since a reasonable person would not have found them to subject homosexuals to "detestation" and vilification".&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 196&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Rothstein J noted that a Bible passage that Whatcott had quoted in Flyers F and G was not hateful expression, writing that "it would only be unusual circumstances and context that could transform a simple reading or publication of a religion’s holy text into what could objectively be viewed as hate speech".&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Remedy ===

Rothstein J reinstated the compensation for those complainants who had received flyers which were in contravention of the ''SHRC''.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==

Reaction to the Supreme Court's decision was mixed. [[Andrew Coyne]] called ''Whatcott'' a "calamitous decision", criticizing the Supreme Court's loose definition of "harm" and Rothstein J's finding that "truth may be used for widely disparate ends".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/andrew-coyne-supreme-court-twists-the-charter-of-rights-in-its-haste-to-limit-free-speech |title=Andrew Coyne: Supreme Court twists the Charter of Rights in its haste to limit free speech |last1=Coyne |first1=Andrew |date=27 February 2013 |publisher=[[National Post]] |access-date=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlie Gillis, writing for [[Macleans]], described the decision as a "missed opportunity to erect robust legal protections around a bedrock Canadian value".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/politics/whatcott-fallout-the-supreme-court-upholds-protections-we-dont-need/ |title=Whatcott fallout: the Supreme Court upholds protections we don't need |last1=Gillis |first1=Charlie |date=27 February 2013 |publisher=[[Macleans]] |access-date=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pearl Eliadis, writing for the [[Montreal Gazette]], called the decision "reasonable and balanced" and found that it would "provide comfort to those concerned about being found liable for "offending" others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.mcgill.ca/droit/2013/04/11/eliadis-oped-scc-decision/ |title=Opinion: Supreme Court decision in Whatcott case is fair and balanced |last1=Eliadis |first1=Pearl |date=27 February 2013 |publisher=[[Montreal Gazette]] |access-date=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shamrock Farm''' was Britain's only non-human [[primate]] importation and [[quarantine]] centre, located in [[Small Dole]], near Brighton in [[West Sussex]]. The centre, owned by [[Bausch and Lomb]], and run by [[Charles River Laboratories, Inc.]] for Shamrock (GB) Ltd, closed in 2000 after a 15-month protest by British animal rights activists, who campaigned under the name "Save the Shamrock Monkeys."&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ukonline.co.uk/archangel2003/cafin/shamfacts.htm "Save the Shamrock Monkeys"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050123220506/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/archangel2003/cafin/shamfacts.htm |date=2005-01-23 }}, website of the campaign.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:ShamrockFarmMay2000.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Shamrock Farm cabins that held the [[primate]]s were dismantled in May 2000 after a 15-month campaign by animal rights activists.]] --&gt;

==Background==
The company was set up in 1954, trading in wild-caught primates until 1993 and captive-bred ones thereafter. The animals were held in windowless cabins in the company's {{convert|40000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} facility, surrounded by 16&amp;nbsp;ft-high fences, razor wire, and cameras. A touch-sensitive wire ran along the base of the perimeter, with [[CCTV]] cameras zooming in on any spot that was touched.&lt;ref name=Argus&gt;[https://archive.is/20130421101038/http://archive.theargus.co.uk/2003/10/2/124673.html "Shamrock Farm open for business"], ''The Argus'', October 2, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Primates captured from the wild, or purchased from breeding facilities, were held there for two months for tests, until they were ready to be sold to [[Animal testing|animal-testing]] laboratories across Europe. It was Europe's largest supplier of primates to laboratories, and held up to 350 monkeys at a time, processing 2,500 a year on average, and selling them for around £1,600 each. The company bought and sold [[baboon]]s, [[macaque]]s, [[grivet]], [[Patas Monkey|patas]], and [[squirrel monkey]]s; almost all of the 2,467 [[macaque]]s used in British laboratories in 1998 came through Shamrock. Its customers included [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]], [[SmithKline Beecham]], [[GlaxoWellcome]], the [[Porton Down]] military science park, and the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, London, Glasgow, and Manchester, according to [[Animal Aid]].&lt;ref name=Vernelli&gt;Vernelli, Toni. [https://web.archive.org/web/20010424192419/http://www.animalaid.org.uk/news/0006good.htm "Good riddance to Shamrock Farm"], Animal Aid, June 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Keith Mann]], Shamrock also took primates from British zoos and theme parks, including 83 macaques from [[Longleat]], 32 from [[Woburn Abbey]], and several different species from Ravensden and [[Robin Hill (theme park)|Robin Hill]] on the Isle of Wight.&lt;ref name=Mann556&gt;[[Keith Mann|Mann, Keith]]. ''From Dusk 'til Dawn: An insider's view of the growth of the Animal Liberation Movement''. Puppy Pincher Press, 2007, p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's main customer was Huntingdon Life Sciences, which in one year purchased 373 cage-bred macaques, 440 wild-caught monkeys, eight squirrel monkeys, and 37 baboons, according to documents obtained by activists. Keith Mann writes that Shamrock delivered nearly 50,000 monkeys to laboratories in Britain during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Mann556/&gt;

==BUAV investigation==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Buav-logo.gif|right|180px|Logo of the BUAV in 2006]] --&gt;In 1992, an undercover investigation by the [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]] (BUAV) found high mortality rates among the monkeys from [[enteritis]] and [[pneumonia]], while other monkeys were being killed if they were underweight or suffered from deformities. The primates were allegedly denied socialization, stimulation, or environmental enrichment, and engaged in [[stereotypical behavior]]s, such as continuous rocking, twisting, self-mutilation, and wailing. BUAV also witnessed rough handling by staff, who were alleged to have been inadequately trained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buav.org/undercover/shamrock.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the BUAV investigation, the company announced in 1993 that it would stop buying wild primates. It started trading instead in primates from breeding centres in [[China]], [[Mauritius]], and the [[Philippines]], although no laws exist in these countries to prevent stocks of primates being brought in from the wild.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10000">A '''shareholders' agreement''' (sometimes referred to in the [[United States|U.S.]] as a '''stockholders' agreement''') (SHA) is an agreement amongst the [[shareholder]]s or members of a [[company]]. In practical effect, it is analogous to a [[partnership agreement]].

In strict legal theory, the relationships amongst the shareholders and those between the shareholders and the company are regulated by the [[constitutional documents]] of the company.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} However, where there are a relatively small number of shareholders, like in a [[Startup company]], it is quite common in practice for the shareholders to supplement the constitutional document.
There are a number of reasons why the shareholders may wish to supplement (or supersede) the constitutional documents of the company in this way:
* a company's constitutional documents are normally available for public inspection, whereas the terms of a shareholders' agreement, as a private law [[contract]], are normally confidential between the parties.
* contractual arrangements are generally cheaper and less formal to form, administer, revise or terminate.
* the shareholders might wish to provide for disputes to be resolved by [[Arbitration clause|arbitration]], or in the [[Forum selection clause|courts of a foreign country]] (meaning a country other than the country in which the company is [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]]).  In some countries, corporate law does not permit such dispute resolution clauses to be included in the constitutional documents.
* greater flexibility; the shareholders may anticipate that the company's business requires regular changes to their arrangements, and it may be unwieldy to repeatedly amend the corporate constitution.
* corporate law in the relevant country may not provide sufficient protection for minority shareholders, who may seek to better protect their position by using a shareholders' agreement
* to provide mechanisms for removing minority shareholders which preserve the company as a [[going concern]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, in many countries, the only remedy where the company is being run in a manner prejudicial to the minority shareholders is a just and equitable "[[liquidation|winding-up]]" of the company, which is the commercial equivalent of the [[judgment of Solomon]].  By putting put and call options in a shareholders' agreement, the parties can ensure that a dissenting minority can be bought out at a fair value without destroying the company.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==
There are also certain risks which can be associated with putting a shareholders' agreement in place in some countries.
* In some countries, using a shareholders' agreement can constitute a [[partnership]], which can have unintended [[tax]] consequences, or result in liability attaching to shareholders in the event of a bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;Under English law, a shareholders' agreement is often suggested as an inference of a "quasi-partnership", which entitles disappointed partners to certain shareholder remedies, see [[Ebrahimi_v_Westbourne_Galleries|''Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Ltd'' [1973] AC 360]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Where the shareholders' agreement is inconsistent with the constitutional documents, the efficacy of the parties' intended arrangement can be undermined.
* Countries with notarial formalities, where notarial fees are set by the value of the subject matter, parties can find that their agreement is subject to prohibitively high notarial costs, which, if they fail to pay, would result in the agreement being [[unenforceable]].
* In certain circumstances, a shareholders' agreement can be put forward as evidence of a conspiracy and/or [[monopoly|monopolistic practices]].&lt;ref&gt;Although, in each case, this would only be likely if the agreement covered more than one company.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common characteristics==

Shareholders' agreements vary enormously between different countries and different commercial fields.  However, in a characteristic joint venture or business [[Startup company|startup]], a shareholders' agreement would normally be expected to regulate the following matters:

* regulating the ownership and voting rights of the [[stock|share]]s in the company, including 
** [[Lock-down provision]]s
** restrictions on transferring shares, or granting [[security interest]]s over shares
** [[pre-emption right]]s and [[Right of first refusal|rights of first refusal]] in relation to any shares issued by the company (often called a ''[[buy-sell agreement]]'')
** "[[Tag-along right|tag-along]]" and "[[Drag-along right|drag-along]]" rights&lt;ref&gt;"Tag along" rights refer to the power of a minority shareholder to sell their shares to a  purchaser at the same price as any other selling shareholder, ie. if one shareholder wants to sell, they can only do so if the buyer agrees to buy out the other shareholders who wish to sell at the same price.  "Drag along" refers to the power of larger shareholders to compel the minority shareholder to sell when a purchaser wants to acquire 100% (or in some cases a majority stake) of the company, ie. a purchaser wishes to buy the company at a high valuation but only if they can purchase the entire issued share capital, and 3 out of the 4 shareholders wish to sell, but the 4th does not, well drafted drag-along rights would enable the 3 shareholders to compel the 4th to sell their share at the same price.&lt;/ref&gt;
** minority protection provisions&lt;ref&gt;For the normal position in relation to minority rights, see for example, ''[[Foss v Harbottle]]'' (1843) 2 Hare 461&lt;/ref&gt;
* control and management of the company, which may include
** power for certain shareholders to designate individual for election to the [[board of directors]]
** imposing super-majority voting requirements for "reserved matters" which are of key importance to the parties
** imposing requirements to provide shareholders with accounts or other information that they might not otherwise be entitled to by law
* making provision for the resolution of any future disputes between shareholders, including
** [[deadlock provision]]s&lt;ref&gt;In a joint venture, "deadlock" refers to the parties being unable to agree on a key matter.  If there are only two key parties, this can deadlock the vehicle, and leave it wallowing.&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[dispute resolution]] provisions
* protecting the competitive interests of the company which may include
** restrictions on a shareholder's ability to be involved in a competing business to the company
** restrictions on a shareholder's ability to poach key employees of the company
** key terms with suppliers or customers who are also shareholders

In addition, shareholders agreements will often make provision for the following:
* the nature and amount of initial contribution (whether capital contribution or other) to the company
* the proposed nature of the business
* how any future capital contributions or financing arrangements are to be made
* the [[Choice of law clause|governing law]] of the shareholders' agreement&lt;ref&gt;Whilst this is often the same as the law of the company's incorporation, it is sometimes chosen deliberately to be different, so as to allow a more flexible law of contract to overcome perceived limitations in the corporate law of the company's jurisdiction.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ethical practices&lt;ref&gt;It is not uncommon to see shareholders' agreements between parties from developed countries and parties from emerging markets which provide that the company shall not engage in corrupt practices.  Although in many countries it may be considered normal for local business to [[bribe]] officials to facilitate the conduct of business, many Western countries impose severe penalties on business who engage in corrupt practices abroad, and so Western investors often seek to ensure that their partners do not engage in anything which could breach such legislation in the Western investors' jurisdiction.  See for example the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] in the [[United States|U.S.A.]] and the [[Bribery Act 2010]] in the UK&lt;/ref&gt; or environmental practices
* allocation of key roles or responsibilities

==Registration==

In most countries, registration of a shareholders' agreement is not required for it to be effective. Indeed, it is the perceived greater flexibility of [[contract|contract law]] over [[corporations law|corporate law]] that provides much of the ''raison d'être'' for shareholders' agreements.

This flexibility, however, can give rise to conflicts between a shareholders' agreement and the constitutional documents of a company. Although laws differ across countries, in general most conflicts are resolved as follows:
* as against outside parties, only the constitutional documents regulate the company's powers and proceedings.
* as between the company and its shareholders, a breach of the shareholders' agreement which does not breach the constitutional documents will still be a valid corporate act, but it may sound in damages against the party who breaches the agreement.
* as between the company and its shareholders, a breach of the constitutional documents which does not breach the shareholders' agreement will nonetheless usually be an invalid corporate act.
* characteristically, courts will not grant an [[injunction]] or award [[specific performance]] in relation to a shareholders' agreement where to do so would be inconsistent with the company's constitutional documents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2619">'''Speedlock''' is a software protection system used on the [[ZX Spectrum]] and the [[Amstrad CPC]], written by David Aubrey-Jones and David Looker in 1983. The two programmers had become frustrated at the slow loading times of the computer's tape loading system, and realised it would be possible to write a better one. The prototype sat unused for about a year, but was finally picked up by [[Ocean Software]] on [[Daley Thompson's Decathlon]], released in late 1984.&lt;ref name="crash"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/44/david_aj.htm|last=Eddy|first=Richard|year=1987|publisher=Crash|issue=44|title=The One David|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently used by [[U.S. Gold]] and for several titles by [[Ultimate Play the Game]], amongst others.&lt;ref name="lerm"/&gt; Speedlock was also ported to the [[Amstrad CPC]] in 1985.

The system used several advanced features of the Spectrum's architecture, such as the memory refresh register and parity branch instructions of the [[Z80]] processor, which made it harder to create [[copyright infringement|illegitimate copies]] without the protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showwrap.cgi?page=hth61.html|last=North|first=Jon|year=1990|publisher=Your Sinclair|title=How To Hack : Speedlock|issue=61|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early versions used a set of audible "clicking" lead tones when loading a program, later versions did not include this, but instead had a counter showing the time left to finish loading the program similar to that of [[Technician Ted]] and [[Fairlight (video game)|Fairlight]].&lt;ref name="crash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lerm"&gt;{{cite book|url=ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/games-info/l/LermTapeUtilityD.pdf|title=Lerm Tape Utility D (instruction manual)|publisher=Lerm|year=1990|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/tapsamp.html#schemes|title=Tape Decoding : Encoding schemes|author=Martin van der Heide, Martin Kopanske and Tomaz Kac|publisher=World of Spectrum|date=1997–1999|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.crashonline.org.uk/13/techted.htm | title = CRASH review from 1985 | accessdate = 2007-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some companies created software to bypass protection schemes, including Speedlock, for the purpose of [[backup|backing up]] or transferring to [[ZX Microdrive|Microdrive]], the Spectrum +3, or other proprietary disk systems.&lt;ref name="lerm"/&gt;

{{Competition law}}
'''Tying''' (informally, '''product tying''') is the practice of selling one product or service as a mandatory addition to the purchase of a different product or service. In legal terms, a ''tying sale'' makes the sale of one [[Good (economics)|good]] (the ''tying good'') to the [[de facto]] customer (or [[de jure]] customer) conditional on the purchase of a second distinctive good (the ''tied good''). Tying is often illegal when the products are not naturally related. It is related to but distinct from [[freebie marketing]], a common (and legal) method of giving away (or selling at a substantial discount) one item to ensure a continual flow of sales of another related item.

Some kinds of tying, especially by [[contract]], have historically been regarded as [[anti-competitive practices]]. The basic idea is that consumers are harmed by being forced to buy an undesired good (the tied good) in order to purchase a good they actually want (the tying good), and so would prefer that the goods be sold separately. The company doing this [[product bundling|bundling]] may have a significantly large market share so that it may impose the tie on consumers, despite the forces of market competition. The tie may also harm other companies in the market for the tied good, or who sell only single components.

One effect of tying can be that low quality products achieve a higher market share than would otherwise be the case.

Tying may also be a form of [[price discrimination]]: people who use more razor blades, for example, pay more than those who just need a one-time shave. Though this may improve overall welfare, by giving more consumers access to the market, such price discrimination can also transfer consumer surpluses to the producer. Tying may also be used with or in place of [[patent]]s or [[copyright]]s to help protect entry into a market, discouraging innovation.

Tying is often used when the supplier makes one product that is critical to many customers. By threatening to withhold that key product unless others are also purchased, the supplier can increase sales of less necessary products.

In the [[United States]], most [[U.S. state|states]] have laws against tying, which are enforced by state governments. In addition, the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Department of Justice]] enforces federal laws against tying through its [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division|Antitrust Division]].

==Types==
'''Horizontal tying''' is the practice of requiring consumers to pay for an unrelated product or service together with the desired one.&lt;ref name=horizvert&gt;{{cite web|title=Tying|url=http://www.whitecollarfirm.com/CM/Custom/Tying-Antitrust-Defense-Attorneys.asp|publisher=The Blanch Law Firm|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A hypothetical example would be for [[Société Bic|Bic]] to sell its pens only with Bic lighters. (However, a company may offer a limited free item with another purchase as a promotion.)

'''Vertical tying''' is the practice of requiring customers to purchase related products or services together, from the same company.&lt;ref name=horizvert /&gt; For example, a company might mandate that its automobiles could only be serviced by its own dealers. In an effort to curb this, many jurisdictions require that warranties not be voided by outside servicing; for example, see the [[Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act]] in the United States.

==In United States law==
Certain tying arrangements are illegal in the [[United States]] under both the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]],&lt;ref&gt;''See'' ''N. Pac. Ry Co. v. United States'', 356 U.S. 1 (1958); ''[[International Salt Co. v. United States]]'', [[Case citation|332 U.S. 392]] (1947)&lt;/ref&gt; and Section 3 of the [[Clayton Act]].&lt;ref&gt;15 U.S.C. s. 14&lt;/ref&gt; A tying arrangement is defined as "an agreement by a party to sell one product but only on the condition that the buyer also purchases a different (or tied) product, or at least agrees he will not purchase the product from any other supplier."&lt;ref&gt;''N. Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5-6 (1958)''&lt;/ref&gt; Tying may be the action of several companies as well as the work of just one firm. Success on a tying claim typically requires proof of four elements: (1) two separate products or services are involved; (2) the purchase of the tying product is conditioned on the additional purchase of the tied product; (3) the seller has sufficient market power in the market for the tying product; (4) a not insubstantial amount of interstate commerce in the tied product market is affected.&lt;ref&gt;''Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., Inc.'', 504 U.S. 451, 461–62 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

For at least three decades, the Supreme Court defined the required "economic power" to include just about any departure from [[perfect competition]], going so far as to hold that possession of a copyright or even the existence of a tie itself gave rise to a presumption of economic power.&lt;ref&gt;''See Fornter Enterprises v. United States Steel'', 394 U.S. 495 (1969); ''United States v. Loew's, Inc''. 372 U.S. 38 (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court has since held that a plaintiff must establish the sort of market power necessary for other antitrust violations in order to prove sufficient "economic power" necessary to establish a per se tie.&lt;ref&gt;''See Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde'', 466 U.S. 2 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, the Court has eliminated any presumption of market power based solely on the fact that the tying product is patented or copyrighted.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Illinois Tool Works v. Independent Ink'', 547 U.S. 28 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, changing business practices surrounding new technologies have put the legality of tying arrangements to the test. Although the Supreme Court still considers some tying arrangements as ''per se'' illegal, the Court actually uses a rule-of-reason analysis, requiring an analysis of foreclosure effects and an affirmative defense of efficiency justifications.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gregory Sidak, ''Do Free Mobile Apps Harm Consumers?'', 52 SAN DIEGO L. REV. (forthcoming Aug. 2015), https://www.criterioneconomics.com/docs/do-free-mobile-apps-harm-consumers.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of iPhone#Exclusivity tying of iPhone to AT&amp;T}}
The tying of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] products is an example of commercial tying that has caused recent controversy.  When Apple initially released the [[iPhone]] on June 29, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/54769/2007/01/iphone.html |title=Apple unveils iPhone |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate=March 14, 2011 |author=Honan, Mathew |work=[[Macworld]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was [[History of iPhone#Exclusivity tying of iPhone to AT&amp;T|sold exclusively with AT&amp;T]] (formerly [[Cingular]]) contracts in the United States.&lt;ref name="CNN secrets"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/01/10/commentary/lewis_fortune_iphone.fortune/index.htm|title=How Apple kept its iPhone secrets|last=Lewis|first=Peter|date=January 12, 2007|publisher=[[CNN|CNN Money]]|accessdate=January 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To enforce this exclusivity, Apple employed a type of [[ Phone unlocking|software lock]] that ensured the phone would not work on any network besides AT&amp;T's.&lt;ref name=softwareLocking&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/29/technology/29iphone.html?_r=1 | title=Altered iPhones Freeze Up | author=Hafner, Katie | date=September 29, 2007 | accessdate=March 15, 2011 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related to the concept of [[bricking]], any user who tried to unlock or otherwise tamper with the locking software ran the risk of rendering their iPhone permanently inoperable.&lt;ref name=softwareLocking /&gt;
This caused complaints among many consumers, as they were forced to pay an additional early termination fee of $175 if they wanted to unlock the device safely for use on a different carrier.&lt;ref name="Democracts criticize"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9742441-7.html|title=Democrats criticize AT&amp;T's exclusive iPhone deal|last=Broache|first=Anne|date=July 11, 2007|publisher=[[CNET News]]|accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other companies such as [[Google]] complained that tying encourages a more closed-access-based wireless service.&lt;ref name="Democracts criticize"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2015}} Many questioned the legality of  the arrangement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.recong2.com/journal/does_apples_tightly_controlled_ecosystem_strategy_constitute_an_illegal_tying_arrangement | title=Does Apple's Tightly Controlled Ecosystem Strategy Constitute and Illegal Tying Arrangement? |date=July 6, 2007 |accessdate=March 15, 2011 | author=Gonsowski, Laurie}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in October 2007 a [[Class action lawsuit|class-action lawsuit]] was filed against Apple, claiming that its exclusive agreement with AT&amp;T violates California [[antitrust law]].&lt;ref name=classActionLawsuit&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2007/10/california-man-seeks-class-action-lawsuit-over-iphone-bricking-lock-in.ars | title=California man seeks class action lawsuit over iPhone bricking, lock-in | date=October 7, 2007 | accessdate=March 15, 2011 | author=Chartier, David | work=[[ars technica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was filed by the Law Office of Damian R. Fernandez on behalf of California resident Timothy P. Smith,&lt;ref name=classActionLawsuit /&gt; and ultimately sought to have an injunction issued against Apple to prevent it from selling iPhones with any kind of software lock.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2007/10/california_resi.html | title=Apple Class-Action Suit Filed by California Man Over iPhone Bricking | date=October 5, 2007 | accessdate=March 15, 2011 | author = Wolfe, Alexander | work=[[InformationWeek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, federal regulators clarified the issue when they determined it was lawful to unlock (or in other terms, "jail break") the iPhone, declaring that there was no basis for copyright law to assist Apple in protecting its restrictive business model.&lt;ref name=Jailbreaking&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/07/feds-ok-iphone-jailbreaking/ | title = U.S. Declares iPhone Jailbreaking Legal, Over Apple's Objections| author = Kravets, David | date=July 26, 2010 | accessdate=March 15, 2011 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[IOS jailbreaking|Jail breaking]] is removing [[operating system]] or hardware restrictions imposed on an iPhone (or other device). If done successfully, this allows one to run any application on the phone they choose, including applications not authorized by Apple.&lt;ref name=Jailbreaking /&gt; Apple told regulators that modifying the iPhone operating system leads to the creation of an infringing [[derivative work]] that is protected by copyright law. This means that the license on the operating system forbids software modification.&lt;ref name=Jailbreaking /&gt; However, regulators agreed that modifying an iPhone's firmware/operating system to enable it to run an application that Apple has not approved fits comfortably within the four corners of [[fair use]].&lt;ref name=Jailbreaking /&gt;

Another prominent case involving a tying claim was ''[[United States v. Microsoft]]''.&lt;ref name="See 2001"&gt;''See [[United States v. Microsoft]], 253 F.3d 34 (D.C. Cir. 2001).''&lt;/ref&gt; By some accounts, [[Microsoft]] ties together [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Internet Explorer]], [[Windows Media Player]], [[Outlook Express]] and [[Microsoft Office]]. The United States claimed that the bundling of Internet Explorer (IE) to sales of [[Windows 98]], making IE difficult to remove from Windows 98 (e.g., not putting it on the "Remove Programs" list), and designing Windows 98 to work "unpleasantly" with Netscape Navigator constituted an illegal tying of Windows 98 and IE.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 64-67, 84-86.&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft's counterargument was that a [[web browser]] and a mail reader are simply part of an [[operating system]], included with other [[personal computer]] operating systems, and the integration of the products was technologically justified. Just as the definition of a [[car]] has changed to include things that used to be separate products, such as [[speedometer]]s and radios, Microsoft claimed the definition of an operating system has changed to include their formerly separate products. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] rejected Microsoft's claim that Internet Explorer was simply one facet of its operating system, but the court held that the tie between Windows and Internet Explorer should be analyzed deferentially under the [[Rule of Reason]].&lt;ref name="See 2001"/&gt;  The U.S. government claim settled before reaching final resolution.

As to the tying of Office, parallel cases against Microsoft brought by [[State Attorney General|State Attorneys General]] included a claim for harm in the market for office productivity applications.&lt;ref&gt;See Complaint filed in New York v. Microsoft Corp. PP 88-95, 98, 117-19, No. 98-1233 (D.D.C. filed May 18, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The Attorneys General abandoned this claim when filing an amended complaint. The claim was revived by [[Novell]] where they alleged that manufacterers of computers ("[[OEM]]s") were charged less for their Windows bulk purchases if they agreed to bundle Office with every PC sold than if they gave computer purchasers the choice whether or not to buy Office along with their machines — making their computer prices less competitive in the market. The Novell litigation is still ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Civil No. JFM-05-1087.&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft has also tied its software to the third-party [[Android OS|Android]] mobile operating system, by requiring manufacturers that license [[patent]]s it claims covers the OS and [[smartphone]]s to ship [[Microsoft Office Mobile]] and [[Skype]] applications on the devices.&lt;ref name="supersite-androidpatents"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trent|first1=Rod|title=Microsoft Inside: 20 New Android Device Manufacturers Sign-on to Pre-Install Office and Skype|url=http://winsupersite.com/mobile/microsoft-inside-20-new-android-device-manufacturers-sign-pre-install-office-and-skype|website=SuperSite for Windows|publisher=Penton|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-xiaomims"&gt;{{cite web|title=Xiaomi will bundle Microsoft’s Office and Skype apps on its Android devices|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/1/11827268/microsoft-xiaomi-skype-office-android-apps-patent-deal|website=The Verge|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-tying provision of the Bank Holding Company Act==
In 1970, Congress enacted section 106 of the [[Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970]] (BHCA), the anti-tying provision, which is codified at 12 U.S.C. § 1972. The statute was designed to prevent banks, whether large or small, state or federal, from imposing anticompetitive conditions on their customers. Tying is an antitrust violation, but the Sherman and Clayton Acts did not adequately protect borrowers from being required to accept conditions to loans issued by banks, and section 106 was specifically designed to apply to and remedy such bank misconduct.

Banks are allowed to take measures to protect their loans and to safeguard the value of their investments, such as requiring security or guaranties from borrowers. The statute exempts so-called “traditional banking practices” from its ''per se'' illegality, and thus its purpose is not so much to limit banks' lending practices, as it is to ensure that the practices used are fair and competitive. A majority of claims brought under the BHCA are denied. Banks still have quite a bit of leeway in fashioning loan agreements, but when a bank clearly steps over the bounds of propriety, the plaintiff is compensated with treble damages.

At least four regulatory agencies including the [[Federal Reserve Board]] oversee the activities of banks, their holding companies, and other related depository institutions. While each type of depository institution has a “primary regulator”, the nation’s “dual banking” system allows concurrent jurisdiction among the different regulatory agencies. With respect to the anti-tying provision, the Fed takes the preeminent role in relation to the other financial institution regulatory agencies, which reflects that it was considered the least biased (in favor of banks) of the regulatory agencies when section 106 was enacted.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Timothy D. Naegele, The Bank Holding Company Act's Anti-Tying Provision: 35 Years Later, 122 Banking Law Journal 195 (2005); http://www.naegele.com/whats_new.html#articles.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ultramares Corporation v. Touche''''', 174 N.E. 441 (1932) is a [[US tort law]] case regarding negligent [[misstatement]], decided by [[Benjamin Cardozo|Cardozo, C.J.]] It contained the now famous line on "floodgates" that the law should not admit "to a liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class."

==Facts==
In 1924 the auditors of Touche Niven ([[Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu|Touche, Niven &amp; Company]]) gave the rubber importer, Fred Stern and Company, an unqualified audit certificate, having failed to discover that management had falsified entries to overstate accounts receivable. The auditors knew that the accounts when certified would be used to raise money and for that purpose supplied 32 certified and serially numbered copies: p.&amp;nbsp;442. On the faith of one of those copies, given to it on its demand, the plaintiff, Ultramares Corporation, lent Fred Stern and Company money. Stern declared bankruptcy in 1925. Ultramares sued Touche Niven for the amount of the Stern debt, declaring that a careful audit would have shown Stern to be insolvent. The audit was found to be negligent, but not fraudulent. The judge set this finding aside based on the doctrine of privity, which protects auditors from third party suits. An intermediate appellate court reinstated the negligence verdict. The case then went to the New York Court of Appeals, Judge Benjamin Cardozo presiding.

==Judgment==
Cardozo, C.J., held that the claim in [[negligence]] failed on the ground that the auditors owed the plaintiff no duty of care, there being no sufficiently proximate relationship.&lt;ref&gt;At 176-182&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The two causes of action will be considered in succession, first the one for negligence and second that for fraud.

(1) We think the evidence supports a finding that the audit was negligently made, though in so saying we put aside for the moment the question whether negligence, even if it existed, was a wrong to the plaintiff. To explain fully or adequately how the defendants were at fault would carry this opinion beyond reasonable bounds. A sketch, however, there must be, at least in respect of some features of the audit, for the nature of the fault, when understood, is helpful in defining the ambit of the duty.

We begin with the item of accounts receivable. At the start of the defendant's audit, there had been no posting of the general ledger since April, 1923. Siess, a junior accountant, was assigned by the defendants to the performance of that work. On Sunday, February 3, 1924, he had finished the task of posting, and was ready the next day to begin with his associates the preparation of the balance sheet and the audit of its items. The total of the accounts receivable for December, 1923, as thus posted by Siess from the entries in the journal, was $644,758.17. At some time on February 3, Romberg, an employee of the Stern company, who had general charge of its accounts, placed below that total another item to represent additional accounts receivable growing out of the transactions of the month. This new item, $706,843.07, Romberg entered in his own handwriting. The sales that it represented were, each and all, fictitious. Opposite the entry were placed other figures (12-29), indicating or supposed to indicate a reference to the journal. Siess when he resumed his work saw the entries thus added, and included the new item in making up his footings, with the result of an apparent increase of over $700,000 in the assets of the business. He says that in doing this he supposed the entries to be correct, and that his task at the moment being merely to post the books, he thought the work of audit or verification might come later, and put it off accordingly. The time sheets, which are in evidence, show very clearly that this was the order of time in which the parts of the work were done. Verification, however, there never was either by Siess or by his superiors, or so the triers of the facts might say. If any had been attempted, or any that was  adequate, an examiner would have found that the entry in the ledger was not supported by any entry in the journal. If from the journal he had gone to the book from which the journal was made up, described as "the debit memo book," support would still have failed. Going farther, he would have found invoices, seventeen in number, which amounted in the aggregate to the interpolated item, but scrutiny of these invoices would have disclosed suspicious features in that they had no shipping number nor a customer's order number and varied in terms of credit and in other respects from those usual in the business. A mere glance reveals the difference.

The December entry of accounts receivable was not the only item that a careful and skillful auditor would have desired to investigate. There was ground for suspicion as to an item of $113,199.60, included in the accounts payable as due from the Baltic Corporation. As to this the defendants received an explanation, not very convincing, from Stern and Romberg. A cautious auditor might have been dissatisfied and have uncovered what was wrong. There was ground for suspicion also because of the inflation of the inventory. The inventory as it was given to the auditors, was totaled at $347,219.08. The defendants discovered errors in the sum of $303,863.20, and adjusted the balance sheet accordingly. Both the extent of the discrepancy and its causes might have been found to cast discredit upon the business and the books. There was ground for suspicion again in the record of assigned accounts. Inquiry of the creditors gave notice to the defendants that the same accounts had been pledged to two, three and four banks at the same time. The pledges did not diminish the value of the assets, but made in such circumstances they might well evoke a doubt as to the solvency of a business where such conduct was permitted. There was an explanation by Romberg which the defendants accepted as sufficient. Caution and diligence might have pressed investigation farther.

If the defendants owed a duty to the plaintiff to act with the same care that would have been due under a contract of employment, a jury was at liberty to find a verdict of negligence upon a showing of a scrutiny so imperfect and perfunctory. No doubt the extent to which inquiry must be pressed beyond appearances is a question of judgment, as to which opinions will often differ. No doubt the wisdom that is born after the event will engender suspicion and distrust when old acquaintance and good repute may have silenced doubt at the beginning. All this is to be weighed by a jury in applying its standard of behavior, the state of mind and conduct of the reasonable man. Even so, the adverse verdict, when rendered, imports an alignment of the weights in their proper places in the balance and a reckoning thereafter. The reckoning was not wrong upon the evidence before us, if duty be assumed.

We are brought to the question of duty, its origin and measure.

The defendants owed to their employer a duty imposed by law to make their certificate without fraud, and a duty growing out of contract to make it with the care and caution proper to their calling. Fraud includes the pretense of knowledge when knowledge there is none. To creditors and investors to whom the employer exhibited the certificate, the defendants owed a like duty to make it without fraud, since there was notice in the circumstances of its making that the employer did not intend to keep it to himself (Eaton, Cole &amp; Burnham Co. v. Avery, 83 N. Y. 31; Tindle v. Birkett, 171 N. Y. 520). A different question develops when we ask whether they owed a duty to these to make it without negligence. If liability for negligence exists, a thoughtless slip or blunder, the failure to detect a theft or forgery beneath the cover of deceptive entries, may expose accountants to a liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class. The hazards of a business conducted  on these terms are so extreme as to enkindle doubt whether a flaw may not exist in the implication of a duty that exposes to these consequences. We put aside for the moment any statement in the certificate which involves the representation of a fact as true to the knowledge of the auditors. If such a statement was made, whether believed to be true or not, the defendants are liable for deceit in the event that it was false. The plaintiff does not need the invention of novel doctrine to help it out in such conditions. The case was submitted to the jury and the verdict was returned upon the theory that even in the absence of a misstatement of a fact there is a liability also for erroneous opinion. The expression of an opinion is to be subject to a warranty implied by law. What, then, is the warranty, as yet unformulated, to be? Is it merely that the opinion is honestly conceived and that the preliminary inquiry has been honestly pursued, that a halt has not been made without a genuine belief that the search has been reasonably adequate to bring disclosure of the truth? Or does it go farther and involve the assumption of a liability for any blunder or inattention that could fairly be spoken of as negligence if the controversy were one between accountant and employer for breach of a contract to render services for pay?

The assault upon the citadel of privity is proceeding in these days apace. How far the inroads shall extend is now a favorite subject of juridical discussion (Williston, Liability for Honest Misrepresentation, 24 Harv. L. Rev. 415, 433; Bohlen, Studies in the Law of Torts, pp. 150, 151; Bohlen, Misrepresentation as Deceit, Negligence or Warranty, 42 Harv. L. Rev. 733; Smith, Liability for Negligent Language, 14 Harv. L. Rev. 184; Green, Judge and Jury, chapter Deceit, p. 280; 16 Va. Law Rev. 749). In the field of the law of contract there has been a gradual widening of the doctrine of Lawrence v. Fox (20 N. Y. 268), until today the beneficiary of a promise, clearly  designated as such, is seldom left without a remedy (Seaver v. Ransom, 224 N. Y. 233, 238). Even in that field, however, the remedy is narrower where the beneficiaries of the promise are indeterminate or general. Something more must then appear than an intention that the promise shall redound to the benefit of the public or to that of a class of indefinite extension. The promise must be such as to "bespeak the assumption of a duty to make reparation directly to the individual members of the public if the benefit is lost" (Moch Co. v. Rensselaer Water Co., 247 N. Y. 160, 164; American Law Institute, Restatement of the Law of Contracts, §  145). In the field of the law of torts a manufacturer who is negligent in the manufacture of a chattel in circumstances pointing to an unreasonable risk of serious bodily harm to those using it thereafter may be liable for negligence though privity is lacking between manufacturer and user (MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 217 N. Y. 382; American Law Institute. Restatement of the Law of Torts, §  262). A force or instrument of harm having been launched with potentialities of danger manifest to the eye of prudence, the one who launches it is under a duty to keep it within bounds (Moch Co. v. Rensselaer Water Co., supra, at p. 168). Even so, the question is still open whether the potentialities of danger that will charge with liability are confined to harm to the person, or include injury to property (Pine Grove Poultry Farm v. Newton B.-P. Mfg. Co., 248 N. Y. 293, 296; Robins Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co. v. Flint, 275 U. S. 303; American Law Institute, Restatement of the Law of Torts, supra). In either view, however, what is released or set in motion is a physical force. We are now asked to say that a like liability attaches to the circulation of a thought or a release of the explosive power resident in words.

Three cases in this court are said by the plaintiff to have committed us to the doctrine that words, written or oral, if negligently published with the expectation that the reader or listener will transmit them to another, will lay a basis for liability though privity be lacking. These are Glanzer v. Shepard (233 N. Y. 236); International Products Co. v. Erie R. R. Co. (244 N. Y. 331), and Doyle v. Chatham &amp; Phenix Nat. Bank (253 N. Y. 369).}}

A requirement of privity, not of contract but of relationship, was laid down.

*In ''[[Ingram Industries Inc. v. Nowicki]]'' 527 F. Supp. 683 (1981), a federal judge applying the law of Kentucky relied on Section 552 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. Section 552 provides:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Information Negligently Supplied for the Guidance of others (1) One who, in the course of his business, profession or employment, or in any other transaction in which he has a pecuniary interest, supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions, is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by their justifiable reliance upon the information, if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information. (2) Except as stated in subsection (3), the liability stated in subsection (1) is limited to loss suffered (a) by the person or one of a limited group of persons for whose benefit and guidance he intends to supply the information or knows that the recipient intends to supply it; and (b) through reliance upon it in a transaction that he intends the information to influence or knows that the recipient so intends or in a substantially similar transaction. (3) The liability of one who is under a public duty to give the information extends to loss suffered by any of the class of persons for whose benefit the duty is created, in any of the transactions in which it is intended to protect them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*In ''[[Bily v. Arthur Young &amp; Co.]],'' 3 Cal. 4th 370, 834 P.2d 745, 11 Cal. Rptr. 2d 51 (1992), the [[Supreme Court of California]] analyzed ''Ultramares'' and subsequent developments in painstaking detail, then followed New York in declining to impose a general duty of care upon accountants as to the conduct of audits extending to parties other than the accountant's own client.  However, the court also adopted the test of Section 552 of Restatement (Second) of Torts under which an accountant can be held liable to third parties under a negligent misrepresentation theory.  Under the ''Bily'' analysis, when a company is belatedly found to have cooked its books, an investor who simply assumed the company was solvent cannot recover from its accountants, but an investor who actually requested, read, and relied upon its accountants' audit reports may have a cause of action.

In the [[philosophy of law]], '''virtue jurisprudence''' is the set of theories of law related to [[virtue ethics]]. By making the [[aretaic turn]] in legal theory, virtue jurisprudence focuses on the importance of character and human excellence or virtue to questions about the nature of law, the content of the law, and judging.

==The topics encompassed by virtue jurisprudence==

Among the topics encompassed by virtue jurisprudence are:
# Virtue ethics has implications for an account of the proper ends of legislation. If the aim of law is to make citizens virtuous (as opposed to maximizing utility or realizing a set of moral rights), what are the implications for the content of the laws? 
# Virtue ethics has implications for legal ethics. Current approaches to legal ethics emphasize deontological moral theory, i.e. duties to clients and respect for client autonomy, and these deontological approaches are reflected in the various codes of professional conduct that have been devised for lawyers, judges, and legislators. 
# Accounts of the virtue of justice (in particular, Aristotle and Aquinas's theories of natural justice) have implications for debates between natural lawyers and legal positivists over the nature of law. 
# A virtue-centered theory of judging, which describes the particular excellences required by judges.

==Aretaic theories of judging==
===The judicial virtues===

The most developed aspect of virtue jurisprudence is its distinctive theory of judging. A virtue-centered theory of judging offers an account of the characteristics or excellences that make for a good judge. These include: judicial temperance, judicial courage, judicial temperament, judicial intelligence, judicial wisdom, and justice. Although every theory of judging can incorporate some account of judicial virtue, a virtue-centered theory of judging makes the distinctive claim that the judicial virtues are central, ''i.e.'' that they have basic explanatory and normative significance.

===Criticism of a virtue-centered theory of judging===

Many of the criticisms of virtue jurisprudence are parallel to those offered in the context of debates over virtue ethics. Some of these include:
* The charge that virtue jurisprudence does not provide sufficient guidance for the making of legal decisions. "Do as a virtuous judge would do!" This formula provides little instruction to an ordinary decision maker.
* The argument that virtue jurisprudence requires inordinate trust in the capacities of judges. In a democratic society, the rightness or wrongness of legal decisions should be decided by criteria that are public and accessible to all citizens.

==Virtue as the proper end of law==

Aristotle argued that the inculcation of promotion of virtue was the proper end of law. Aquinas argued that true laws (which are rational) can teach virtue by being internalized by those who already possess sufficient virtue to grasp the purpose of the law. Even those who have not yet achieved this level of virtue can be coerced into obedience to the law, and this may enable them to become more virtuous.

A contemporary restatement of this view is found in the writings of Robert George. In his book, ''Making Men Moral'', George argues for the promotion of virtue as the end of law and against the contrary view that the purpose of law is the protection of rights.

==Law and virtue outside the Western tradition==

The phrase "virtue jurisprudence" is usually applied in the context of contemporary Western philosophical thinking about law. There are, however, important ideas about the relationship between law and virtue in other intellectual traditions. One example is provided by [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ideas about virtue. In the [[Analects]], [[Confucius]] argues that a society in which people are virtuous would have no need of judges, rules, or jurisprudence because people would be able to resolve social conflicts by themselves. Thus, it is argued that the idea of virtue is opposed to the idea of law.

It can be argued that even virtuous citizens might disagree about the application of the law, especially where their own interests or ideological commitments are at stake. However, this argument is rather foreign to both traditional and modern Chinese political thought. Chinese political theory tends to assume that the truly virtuous are selfless to the point of martyrdom and would not consider their own personal interests and that the virtuous are able to transcend ideology. At the same time, traditional Chinese political thought regards those with absolute virtue to be historically extremely rare, and that most people, including the Emperor and his officials, are prone to both corruption and error. Consequently, there is a belief that law and indeed government is an unfortunate necessity in dealing with an imperfect world and with imperfect people.

The view that the inculcation of virtue is the proper end of legislation contrasts markedly with traditional Chinese thinking on the subject, which argues that laws exist because men are lacking in virtue. Confucianism places very little faith on the ability of law or external pressure to make men moral but rather believes that virtue must come from introspection and education. Throughout Chinese political and intellectual history, the Confucian view on law was frequently contrasted in discourse and practice with Chinese [[Han Feizi|Legalist]] philosophy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9370">A '''warez group''' is a tightly organised group of people involved in creating and/or distributing [[warez]] such as movies, music or [[software]] ("warez") in [[Warez scene|The Scene]]. There are different types of these groups in the Scene: ''release groups'' and ''courier groups''. Groups often compete, as being the first to bring out a new quality release can bring status and respect - a type of "vanity contest". The warez groups care about the image others have of them.&lt;ref name=Craig2005 /&gt;

==Description==
''[[ANALOG Computing]]'' observed in 1984 that software piracy did not make sense economically to those performing the [[software cracking]].&lt;ref name="harberg198401"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Harberg |first=Allen |date=January 1984 |title=Software Piracy: A Survey |url=https://archive.org/stream/analog-computing-magazine-15#page/n65/mode/2up |magazine=ANALOG Computing |pages=64-66 |quote=I continue to be amazed by the tenacity of the pirates. There are software publishers who market disks which contain 500 unformatted disk sectors. To make an illegal copy of such a disk, you would have to search a sea of unformatted sectors to find a single sector of binary zeroes. Yet I know that there are individuals who will spend untold hours listening to their drives make the most horrifying sounds imaginable while they search for an oasis in a desert of unformatted tracks. Eight hours and 1000 I/O errors later, they've created a back-up of a program which retails for a $29.95! I guess that using leisure time effectively, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary motivation of warez groups is not monetary gain, but the excitement of breaking rules and beating competitors.&lt;ref name=Vanity&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=darknet&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although at least two Scene groups have been asking for [[bitcoin]] donations, PoWeRUp and spamTV.&lt;ref name=bitcoin&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Individual members of these groups are usually also the authors of [[Crack (software)|cracks]] and [[keygen]]s.&lt;ref name=Vanity&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There are warez groups publishing new content outside of the Scene, often referred to as ''[[Social peer-to-peer processes|P2P]] groups''.&lt;ref name=newkids&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They are a lot more accessible for people with access to new movies and are not limited to a set of [[Standard (warez)|rules and regulations]].&lt;ref name="newkids"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] have been combating warez groups with Operation: Cyberstrike&lt;!--200001638-B	closed 15 Feb. 2002--&gt;, [[Operation Buccaneer]], [[Operation Fastlink]], [[Operation Safehaven]] and [[Operation Site Down]].&lt;ref name=KingKong&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Brien|first=Timothy L.|title=King Kong vs. the Pirates of the Multiplex|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/business/media/28movie.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=print|accessdate=2012-05-24|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2005-08-28|authorlink=Timothy L. O'Brien}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="millennium"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pdf.textfiles.com/academics/online-software-piracy-of-the-last-millennium-1_0.pdf |title=Online Software Piracy of the Last Millennium |first=Ben |last=Garrett |date=2004-04-27 |publisher=defacto2.net}}&lt;!-- http://www.defacto2.net/file/detail/a53981 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the P2P group IMAGiNE has been disbanded due to law enforcement actions.&lt;ref name=imagine&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Some game and software groups include [[Razor 1911]], [[Reloaded (warez)|Reloaded]], [[DrinkOrDie]], [[Pirates With Attitude]], [[Class (warez)|Class]], [[Myth (warez)|Myth]] and [[Fairlight (group)|Fairlight]]. For a larger list, see the [[list of warez groups]].

==Release groups==
Release groups are responsible for making warez releases. For example they [[Ripping|rip]] a movie from DVD, encode it to a video file and chop it up in smaller pieces before sharing it. They are at the top of the warez world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Where do you want to pirate today? |author=Adam L. Penenberg |date=1997-08-08 |url=https://www.forbes.com/1997/08/08/column.html |accessdate=2013-07-06 |work=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; An announcement of the release shows up in [[Predb|pre databases]] after making the release available on their affiliate [[Topsite (warez)|sites]]. Access to the original software products is necessary to write cracks and keygens so they share original media among each other, usually using private sites and servers.&lt;ref name=Vanity /&gt; Communication between members happens with [[IRC]].&lt;ref name=darknet&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Warez groups typically add [[.nfo|NFO]] files with their releases. Due to the nature of the scene, not much is known about these groups. Most groups follow one of the different [[Standard (warez)|warez standards]] to prevent being [[Nuke (warez)|nuked]]. Most groups are focused on a single [[Warez#Types_of_warez|category]] (music, movies, television, ...) or genre (e.g. metal music or graffiti&lt;!--i.e. AEROHOLiCS--&gt;).&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2005/01/topsite/ |title=The Shadow Internet |first=Jeff |last=Howe |date=January 2005 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group members have different roles. Most groups have one or more group leaders, aided by people with assignments such as supplier, cracker or ripper. The members are mostly young men.&lt;ref name=darknet/&gt;

==Courier groups==
Courier groups take releases and distribute them. This can be done using [[File eXchange Protocol|FXP]] to [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] sites. There are more couriers in the scene than there are crackers, suppliers and sites combined.&lt;ref name=Craig2005 /&gt;

Couriers are a specific class of [[Topsite (warez)|topsite]] users who earn their access by uploading new releases and filling requests. When a courier gains access to a topsite, they are often required to pass a trial test such as uploading a certain amount in a short period of time.&lt;ref name=geheimewelt&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Couriers compete (race) against each other for respect, [[Topsite (warez)#Credit system|credits]], access to other topsites, and fun.&lt;ref name=nyt99&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Private couriers often operate as independent (iND) couriers. Some couriers band together to form [[List of warez groups#Courier groups|courier groups]] which provide support and friendship through camaraderie. Although it may be noted that Couriers/Racers are looked down upon more than ever by affiliates and topsite staff with the increase of scripts that perform the couriers tasks automatically.

The '''''Youth Criminal Justice Act''''' ('''YCJA'''; {{lang-fr|Loi sur le système de justice pénale pour les adolescents}}) (the ''Act'') is a Canadian [[statute]], which came into effect on April 1, 2003. It covers the prosecution of youths for [[criminal law|criminal offences]]. The ''Act'' replaced the ''[[Young Offenders Act]]'', which itself was a replacement for the ''[[Juvenile Delinquents Act]]''.

==Definition of youth==
The ''Act'' governs the application of criminal and correctional law to those 12 years old or older, but younger than 18 at the time of committing the offence (Section 2 of the YCJA). Youth aged 14 to 17 may be sentenced as adults under certain conditions, as described later on in the ''Act''. The [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]], section 13, states "No person shall be convicted of an offence in respect of an act or omission on their part while that person was under the age of twelve years."

==Preamble==
The preamble of the ''Act'' recognizes that youth have rights protected by the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], the [[Canadian Bill of Rights]] and the United Nation's [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].

==Declaration of principles==
The ''Act'' includes four general principles found in section 3(1).&lt;ref name="Declaration of Principle"&gt;{{cite web|title=Declaration of Principle|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/Y-1.5/page-2.html#h-3|work=Youth Criminal Justice Act|publisher=Canada, Department of Justice|accessdate=June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic principles and intentions===
'''Subsection (a)''' addresses the basic principles of the ''Act'' and the ''Act'''s intentions on dealing with young offenders and youth crime. More specifically, subsection (a) sets the basic principle that the YCJA attempts to address underlying behaviour, such as pre-existing conditions or circumstances that would lead to an offending behaviour.&lt;ref name="Law and Legislation for Social Workers"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Fv9cnxqoT-8C&amp;pg=PA211&amp;lpg=PA211&amp;dq=principles+of+ycja&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HNXV51nXZP&amp;sig=ng9KoyuFEmQDEefwvxNFMfT8n6A&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=aJZsSu3tJdP7tgf4ivmaAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3 Books.Google.ca], Rock, N. (2008). Law and Legislation for Social Service Workers. Emond Montgomery Publication. Page, 211. Retrieved July 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It also seeks to, above all, reintegrate young persons who commit offences into society through means of rehabilitation.&lt;ref name="Declaration of Principle"/&gt;

===Accountability, rehabilitation, and reintegration===
'''Subsection (b)''' incorporates a recognition that young people need to be held accountable for their crimes, and have a greater opportunity to be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society.&lt;ref&gt;Endres, Karen. 2004. The Youth Criminal Justice Act: The New Face of Canada's Youth Criminal Justice System. ''Family Court Review''. 42(3). pp. 526–539&lt;/ref&gt; ''The criminal justice system for young persons must be separate from that of adults and emphasize the following:''&lt;ref name="Declaration of Principle" /&gt;

:(i) ''Rehabilitation and Reintegration'':&lt;ref name="Declaration of Principle" /&gt;   The implementation of extrajudicial measures instead of more punitive sentences for less serious offences "address the rehabilitative needs of youths within the limit of a proportionate response to the offence". The goal is to first rehabilitate and then reintegrate (assisting a young offender to adjust back into their community).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

:(ii) ''Fair/proportionate accountability with greater dependency and reduced maturity'':&lt;ref name="Declaration of Principle" /&gt; During sentencing "proportionality determines the degree of intervention of the sentence".&lt;ref name="Barnhorst, Richard"&gt;Barnhorst, Richard. 2004. "The Youth Criminal Justice Act: New Directions and Implementation Issues" Canadian Journal of Criminology and Criminal Justice 46(3)231–250.&lt;/ref&gt; The court must hold the offender accountable only for the acts committed. Therefore, "accountability is to occur through the imposition of meaningful consequences and measures that will promote the rehabilitation and reintegration of youth into society".&lt;ref name="Barnhorst, Richard"/&gt; The offender's level of maturity is considered when deciding on a response to the offence that is both fair and proportionate.

:(iii) ''Enhanced procedural protection, fairness, rights'':&lt;ref name="Declaration of Principle" /&gt; These procedural protections are there to guarantee that young people's rights are protected and that they are treated fairly. Some of these rights include but are not limited to: right to privacy, right to talk with a lawyer and an adult.&lt;ref&gt;Minacker, Joanne C. and Bryan Hogeveen. 2009. "The Operation of the Youth Criminal Justice System." Pp 85–109 in ''Youth, Crime, and Society Issues of Power and Justice''. Toronto, ON: Pearson Education Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
:(iv) ''Ensure timely intervention reinforces link between offence and consequence''.&lt;ref name="Declaration of Principle" /&gt;

:(v) ''Promptness and speed with which persons responsible for this ''Act'' must act, given young persons' perception of time.''&lt;ref name="Declaration of Principle" /&gt;

===Social values===
'''Subsection (c)''' is meant to reflect social values while taking into account each individual's unique situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth Criminal Justice Act: Scope and Principle|url=http://www.johnhoward.org/education/ycj_act/ScopeandPrinciple.pdf|publisher=Edmonton John Howard Society|accessdate=June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It outlines the parameters within which the measures taken against a youth offender are set:

:(i) ''Reinforce respect for societal values''&lt;ref name="Declaration of Principle" /&gt; by implementing exercises that contribute positively to a youth's rehabilitation. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

:(ii) ''Encourage repair of harm done to victims and emphasizing their rights''.&lt;ref name="Declaration of Principle" /&gt; Furthermore, repair of harm done to the community is also encouraged.&lt;ref name="c25"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/LegislativeSummaries/Bills_ls.asp?lang=E&amp;ls=c25&amp;source=library_prb&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=2#apurpose |title=Legislative Summaries (2007/12/13). Bill C-25|accessdate=July 26, 2009  |website=www2.parl.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:(iii) ''Be meaningful for the individual young person given their needs and level of development and, where appropriate, involve the parents, the extended family, the community and social or other agencies in the young person's rehabilitation and reintegration.'' The ''Act'' provides a much bigger role for the parents and the community.&lt;ref name="Declaration of Principle" /&gt;

:(iv) ''Respect gender, ethnic, cultural and linguistic differences and respond to the needs of aboriginal young persons and of young persons with special requirements.''&lt;ref name="Declaration of Principle" /&gt;

===Rights and considerations===
'''Subsection (d)''' describes the special considerations for criminal proceedings against young persons. It highlights four in particular.&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;Tustin, L. (2004). A Guide to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. Toronto: Dayton Ohio.&lt;/ref&gt;

:(i) The rights of young persons, such as right ''to be heard in the course of and to participate in the processes'' and the ''special guarantees of their rights and freedoms''&lt;ref name="Declaration of Principle" /&gt;

:(ii) The rights of victims. They should be treated ''with courtesy, compassion and respect for their dignity and privacy and should suffer the minimum degree of inconvenience as a result of their involvement with the YCJS - youth criminal justice system.''&lt;ref name="healing"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HOCsEIqU-pEC&amp;pg=PA296&amp;lpg=PA296&amp;dq=principles+of+ycja+d&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qGbXfrMx6t&amp;sig=xOwlJ0_8NMdOjVgXH7wOe09GyfU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=oeNsSqerKpLONY_CrPkG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4 Books.Google.ca], Mccaslin, W. D. (2005). Justice As Healing: Indigenous Ways. Washington DC: Living Justice Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

:(iii) The role of victims. They ''should be provided with information about the proceedings and given opportunity to participate and be heard.''&lt;ref name="Declaration of Principle" /&gt;

:(iv) The role of parents. The parents should be informed of their child's proceedings, and are encouraged to ''support them in addressing their offending behaviour.'' (vi)&lt;ref name="Declaration of Principle" /&gt;

==Extrajudicial measures==

Under Part 1 of the ''Act'', '''extrajudicial measures''' are used for responding to less serious youth crimes in a timely and effective manner.  Police are the first officials to be encountered within the system and possess the power to use discretion in deciding whether to issue a warning, a police caution, or a charge. If the youth agrees, the police can also refer the youth to a program under section 7 of the ''Act''.  If the police decide to refer the case to the courts, the [[Crown Attorney|Crown]] can choose to issue a Crown caution.&lt;ref&gt;Minaker, Joanne, and Bryan Hogeveen. Youth, Crime, and Society: Issues of Power and Justice. United States of America: Pearson Education Center, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a warning, caution or referral was issued it means that the police officer has taken no further action on the offence.&lt;ref name="Extrajudicial Measures"&gt;{{cite web|title=Extrajudicial Measures|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/Y-1.5/page-2.html#h-4|work=Youth Criminal Justice Act|publisher=Canada, Department of Justice|accessdate=June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a warning, caution, or referral is not appropriate, an extrajudicial sanction may be considered as well.

===Principles===
Section 4 of the ''Act'' sets out principles that govern the establishment of policies about extrajudicial measures:

===Objectives===
These measures are applied by police and Crown attorneys with the intention that youth can be held liable through non-court measures for their offence(s).&lt;ref name="BC Pocket Guide 2004"&gt;(2004)."Moving Forward: Pocket Guide to the Youth Criminal Justice Act Canada". Second Edition: British Columbia. Retrieved July 23, 2008 [http://www.ag.gov.bc.ca/public/ycja/pocket-guide.pdf Gov.bc.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Section 5 of the ''Act'', objectives of these measures are to:
#Provide an effective and timely response to offending behaviour outside of judicial measures.&lt;ref name=Marinos&gt;Marinos, V., &amp; Innocente, N. (2008). "Factors influencing police attitudes toward extrajudicial measures under the Youth Criminal Justice Act". Canadian Journal of Criminology and Criminal Justice, 50(4), 469–489.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Encourage young persons to acknowledge and repair the harm caused to the victim/community.&lt;ref name=Marinos/&gt;
#Encourage families and members of the community to get involved in implementing the measures.&lt;ref name=Marinos/&gt;
#Provide victims with a chance to take part in the decisions relating to the measures and to receive reparation.&lt;ref name=Marinos/&gt;
#Respect the freedoms of young persons and ensure proportionality to the seriousness of the crime.&lt;ref name=Marinos/&gt;

These objectives are specially designed so that a wide range of diversionary options are available to achieve an array of objectives and it is important to take into consideration many factors when deciding on a fair response to the offence.&lt;ref name=Marinos/&gt; For example, if the young person has already started reparation to the harm done to the victim, the person deciding on the type of extrajudicial measure should consider that factor when determining an appropriate response.&lt;ref&gt;(2008).

===Types of extrajudicial measures===
There are four types of extrajudicial measures (not including [[#Extrajudicial sanctions|extrajudicial sanctions]]):

#Warnings are informal warnings issued by police officers.  They are usually used for minor crimes.&lt;ref name="Canadian Legal FAQs"&gt;Canadian Legal FAQs [http://www.law-faqs.org/wiki/index.php/Ycja-m-03 Law-faqs.org], January 2005.

#Police cautions are formal warnings from the police.  In some jurisdictions, it is expected that police cautions will be in the form of a letter from the police to the young person and the parents, or they may involve a process in which the young person and the parents are requested to appear at a police station to talk to a senior police officer.&lt;ref name = "Canadian Legal FAQs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="backhist" /&gt;
#Crown cautions are similar to police cautions but prosecutors give the caution after the police refer the case to them. In one province where they are currently being used, the caution is in the form of a letter to the young person and the parents.&lt;ref name="backhist" /&gt;
#Referring to different community &lt;ref name = "Canadian Legal FAQs"/&gt;

===Extrajudicial sanctions===
An '''extrajudicial sanction''' is defined as a type of ''extrajudicial measure'' used to deal with a young person only if they cannot be adequately dealt by a warning, caution or referral as outlined [[#Types of extrajudicial measures|above]].  Conditions that dictate this are the seriousness of the offence, the nature and number of previous offences committed by the young person or any other aggravating circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Justice. 2008.

YJCs facilitate interaction between the victim and offender, and recommend appropriate programs/services to treat their situation. Each committee is a group of trained volunteers from the local community. Their main activities include the following:

a. for the youth charged with an offence:
*Recommending an appropriate extrajudicial measure to be used
*Victim support by addressing concerns and mediating between victim and offender
*Ensuring community support by arranging for the use of communal services, and recruiting short-term mentors and supervisors
*Coordinating interaction between the youth criminal justice system and any outside agency/group
b. Reporting to the federal and provincial governments on whether protective measures of the act are followed&lt;br /&gt;
c. Advising the federal and provincial governments on policies and procedures related to the youth criminal justice system&lt;br /&gt;
d. Informing the public in respect of the YCJA and the youth criminal justice system; &lt;br /&gt;

===Appointment of counsel===
The delivery of legal [[counsel]] has two primary models: Judicare and Staff delivery model text to display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/rs/rep-rap/1997/tr97_8-rt97_8/toc-tdm.html|title=We couldn't find that Web page (Error 404) - Department of Justice / Nous ne pouvons trouver cette page Web (Erreur 404) - Ministère de la Justice|website=www.justice.gc.ca|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614033145/http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/rs/rep-rap/1997/tr97_8-rt97_8/toc-tdm.html|archivedate=June 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In judicare delivery model, lawyers in private practice are issued certificates to provide legal aid to clients.

The counsel to represent the young individual is to be appointed by the [[Attorney General]] according to the section 25(5) of the Youth Justice Act.&lt;ref&gt;Canada. Department of Justice.

If eligible, a lawyer will be appointed by the attorney general.

===Assistance by adult===
The Canadian Charter of rights and freedoms and the ''Act'' both hold the right to legal representation for youth. The purpose is to provide extensive opportunity for legal advocacy and advice prior to and during the court process.&lt;ref&gt;Minaker, Joanne and Hogeveen, Bryan. 2009. "The Operation of the youth criminal Justice System". pg 101–102 in Youth, Crime and Society:Issues of power and Justice.

===Statement to youth===
The Statement of Right to Counsel requires that the young person be provided with a written statement that reminds them that they do have the right to request and be represented by legal counsel at any time during the judicial process.&lt;ref name="Youth Criminal Justice Act 2002"&gt;Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Included at various stages of the judicial process, the Statement, ensures that the young person remains alert to their rights, to the continued availability of counsel and to their options for counsel (i.e., Legal Aid).&lt;ref&gt;Bala, N. 2003. Youth Criminal Justice Law. Toronto: Irwin Law, p318&lt;/ref&gt; The Statement must be included with appearance notices or summons, arrest warrants, promises to appear, in all notifications of sentence review and also with all undertakings or recognisance that the young person may participate in under the auspices of the officer in charge.&lt;ref name="Youth Criminal Justice Act 2002"/&gt;  It must also be included with other notifications of legal proceedings such as custody continuations, conditional supervision, decision reviews and all youth justice court reviews.&lt;ref name="Youth Criminal Justice Act 2002"/&gt; The repetition of the document serves as a reminder not only to the young person, but also to those within the judicial system that it is necessary to protect the rights of the young person and guarantee that those rights are upheld throughout the judicial process.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson-Badali, M., Care, S., &amp; Broeking, J. 2007.

Therefore, the officer must assess the accused youth's ability to understand their rights before attaining a statement from the youth.  It is imperative that the officer states the rights to the youth in a manner that he or she fully understands due to the fact that the courts will not assess whether the child fully understood the rights inform to them by the officer but whether or not the officer explained their rights at a level appropriate to their age and understanding.&lt;ref name="canada.justice.gc.ca"&gt;Department of Justice Canada.2008.

===Right to counsel 25(3)===
The fundamental paradigm shift from the ''Youth Offenders Act'' to the ''Youth Criminal Justice Act'' involves the view that deviant youth are now viewed as offenders responsible for their actions.  In a similar comparison to that of adults, the youth are encouraged to obtain legal counsel.&lt;ref&gt;Hogaveen, B. &amp; Smandych, R. (2001). Origins of the Newly Proposed Canadian Youth Criminal Justice Act: Political Discourse and the Perceived Crisis in Youth Crime in the 1990s.  Toronto: Harcourt.&lt;/ref&gt;  The youth justice court or review board is required as a legal implication to advise the young person of their right to counsel.  The following are some typical situations that warrant such advice: at a hearing for the youth when determining to detain or release the individual, at a youth's trial, and in situations where the custody of the youth is in question such as conditional supervision and decision reviews.  The youth justice court or review board is more specifically required to provide a reasonable opportunity to obtain such counsel and this act is viewed as a mandated judicial measure.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, J. (1992).  Legal Representation under the Young Offenders Act. Toronto: University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  A specific difference in comparison to adult courts is the fact that it prohibits criminal proceedings against a youth without the consent of the Attorney General.  In terms of adult proceedings, it is possible for members of the public to commence proceedings without the authorization of police and the Crown Attorney; however, that is not the case with youth.  While comparing the ''Youth Offenders Act'' to the ''Youth Criminal Justice Act'', the former focuses more on a youth's choice to retain counsel and the role of lawyers in the criminal justice system.  In terms of the JDA, more focus was placed on a youth being viewed as a misguided individual who required guidance from the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Tustin, L. &amp; Lutes, R.  (2005).

==Arrest and detention==
Youths may be arrested by the police for more serious offences. The rights expressed in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] apply to youths and adults.

Youths and adults have the right to obtain immediate legal counsel of their own choice upon arrest or detention. The Youth offender also has the right to have their parent(s) or guardian(s) present during questioning. Upon arrest or detainment, these rights must be explained in clear and understandable language.

If the police have violated the above rights, the charges may be dismissed by a judge or any statements made to the police may be ruled inadmissible by the judge in court.

Presumptive offences were found to be unconstitutional and are no longer included in the ''Act''. A presumptive offence is an offence committed or alleged to have been committed by a young person who has attained the age of fourteen years.&lt;ref name="justice.gc.ca|date"&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Justice|url= http://www.justice.gc.ca|date= December 2008|accessdate= July 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adult sentence can be imposed on a young person who is found guilty of an offence for which an adult can be sentenced to imprisonment for more than two years if the offence was committed after a young person is fourteen years of age.&lt;ref name="Bala, Nicholas 2002. Pages 25 &amp; 27"&gt;Bala, Nicholas. Youth Criminal Justice Law. November 2002. Pages 25 &amp; 27. Irwin Law&lt;/ref&gt;  
Presumptive offence may be used under one of the following charges: first-degree or second-degree murder, attempt to commit murder, manslaughter or aggravated sexual assault.&lt;ref name="justice1208"&gt;[http://www.justice.gc.ca Department of Justice], December 2008. Retrieved July 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Other serious offences can fall within presumptive offence if it is the third conviction for such an offence.&lt;ref name="Jobb, Dean 2006.

The media is allowed to identify the youth who receives a sentence for a presumptive offence.&lt;ref name="Jobb, Dean 2006. Page 186"/&gt; The Judge will decide to identify the young person if a) There is reason to believe the young person is a danger to others. b) Publication of the information is necessary to assist in apprehending the young person.&lt;ref name="Bala, Nicholas 2002. Pages 25 &amp; 27"/&gt; 
The age of fourteen may sometimes be raised in a province where the Lieutenant Governor in council has fixed the age greater than fourteen.&lt;ref name="justice1208"/&gt;
Youths who are 12 or 13 at the time of the offense may be sentenced in the same way, only for the following: first degree or second degree murder or manslaughter.

==Right to counsel 25(4) and (10)==
{{duplication|date=July 2013}}
A young person at trial has the right to instruct counsel without delay, where the right to counsel is usually imposed by a young person instead of a parent. Sections 25(4) and (10) allow young people to obtain the same rights as adults, in terms of legal counsel, consent, etc. It is also necessary that young persons be given the right to consult a parent or other adult in some circumstances.&lt;ref name="rcmp-grc.gc.ca"&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

Subsection 25(10) of the ''Act'' permits provinces to establish a program for the recovery of costs of a young person's counsel from the young person or the parents of that young person.&lt;ref name="rcmp-grc.gc.ca"/&gt; Therefore, young people are represented by permanent salaried legal aid lawyers or, as per the specified choice, by a private lawyer who accepts the legal aid mandate payable according to the pre-established rates. If a young offender is ineligible he is represented by a private lawyer at a cost agreed upon by the youth and/or his parents and the lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;

===Identity disclosure===
The ''Act'' allows the public and media to attend the trials of the youths and proceedings may be reported, but the identity of the youth can only be disclosed under special circumstances. The names of 15- to 17-year-olds who are convicted of serious, violent crimes, such as murder or aggravated sexual assault, can be reported in the media. If the youth is considered to be dangerous, their picture can be published in the media along with their name.  Their name may also be revealed if they are still "at large" (have not been arrested yet) for the benefit of the public's safety when the expectation is that they will be charged once police have tracked them down.

On January 1, 2008, the ''Act'''s Privacy clause was tested when several users of the Internet social networking site Facebook posted the identities of murdered Toronto teenager [[Stefanie Rengel]] and her killers (Melissa Todorovic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=July 28, 2009|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2009/07/28/rengel-sentence.html|title=Rengel's murderer sentenced to life|publisher=CBC |location=Canada CBC|date=July 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and David Bagshaw&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Rengel killer sentenced to life|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2009/09/28/rengel-killer-sentencing265.html|publisher=CBC |location=Canada |date=September 28, 2009|accessdate=September 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in defiance of both the publication ban and the fact that the police had not yet received the consent of Rengel's family to release her name to the media.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=https://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2Fstory%2FLAC.20080105.STAB05%2FTPStory%2FTPNational%2FOntario%2F&amp;ord=2107530&amp;brand=theglobeandmail&amp;force_login=true "Facebook proves problematic for police"], ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', January 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; While police and Facebook staff attempted to comply with the privacy regulations by deleting such posts, they noted that it was difficult to effectively police the individual users who repeatedly republished the deleted information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/248379/Angry_Facebook_Users_Illegally_Leaked_the_Names_of_Accused_Underage_Murderers "Angry Facebook Users Illegally Leaked the Names of Accused Underage Murderers"], ''Digital Journal'', January 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many youth in custody prior to their sentencing were also found guilty more often than youths not in custody.&lt;ref name="YCJA References"/&gt; The inconsistent use of pre-trial detention and negative connotations were cause enough for revision.

==Purpose of sentencing==

===Purpose===
The fundamental purpose in the sentencing of young persons pursuant to the ''Act'' is to strike the best possible balance between the interests of the young person and the interests of society. The sentencing judge will also endeavour to impose a sentence that encourages the youth to take responsibility for the consequences of their actions.[s.3, s.38 YCJA]

In cases of very serious crime such as murder, the ''Act'' makes provision for the imposition of an adult sentence upon the youthful offender. In such cases the onus to establish that the young person should be sentenced as an adult is on the prosecution, by virtue of the 2008 Supreme Court of Canada decision ''R v DB''.[2008 SCC 25]

Canadian appellate courts and the Supreme Court of Canada have repeatedly affirmed the principle that young persons convicted of crimes must be sentenced differently from adults. A notable example is the Ontario decision of ''R v D.T''. '2006 OJ 112' (Citation is wrong) where the Court asserted that a separate youth sentencing process is fundamental to Canadian societal notions of justice.

In ''R v C.D. / C.D.K''[2005 SCC 78], the Supreme Court of Canada confirmed that youths will receive the most favourable interpretation available of the ''Act'''s sentencing provisions . In ''C.D / C.D.K.'', the Court ruled that 'violent crime' as defined in s.39 of the ''Act'' did not include arson; the offender was thereby entitled to a more lenient disposition.[ibid, 85]

Since the enactment of the ''Act'' in 2003, a greater number of young persons charged with criminal offences have received the benefit of ''diversion'' that was the practice under the former ''Young Offenders Act''.[Bala (2007), 7].  Diversion refers to the broad range of non-criminal sanctions, including community service that if satisfactorily completed by the youth, the subject charge is withdrawn.

===Committal to custody===
Section 39 (1) of the ''Act'' maintains that a custodial sentence should not be imposed on young offenders unless certain mandatory conditions outlined in the section are satisfied.&lt;ref name="justiceyouthsentencing3040301"&gt;Department of Justice Canada. 2008. "Youth Sentencing Options" Department of Justice Canada, Retrieved July 24, 2009, [http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/yj-jj/repos-depot/3modules/04you-ado/3040301h.html Justice.gc.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719031551/http://justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/yj-jj/repos-depot/3modules/04you-ado/3040301h.html |date=July 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this section is to provide specific guidance to judges who are considering imposing a custodial sentence with the principal focus of reducing Canada's "over-reliance on the incarceration of non-violent young persons".&lt;ref name="site.ebrary.com"/&gt; Section 39 (1) (a) specifically places restrictions on the use of custodial sentences for non-violence offences&lt;ref&gt;Rock, Nora. 2005.

Also, the judges must take into account any rehabilitative concerns that would alter the nature and reduce the severity of the sentence by mitigating factors.&lt;ref name="site.ebrary.com"/&gt; For an example, courts must be certain to not impose a severe sentence in situations of rehabilitative of child welfare concerns. For an example, a custodial sentence should not be imposed to achieve rehabilitation purposes or to tackle such social circumstances such as lack of housing or an abusive home environment.

Section 39 of the ''Act'' restricts the use of custodial sentences for young persons&lt;ref name="Evaluating the youth criminal justice act after five years: A qualified success"&gt;Bala, N., Carrington, P.

Subsection (1) (d) defines one of these criteria and states that custodial sentences may be used in those exceptional cases where the youth has committed an indictable offense. Further, the nature of the indictable offense must be such that imposing a non-custodial sentence would not fulfil the purpose and principles of sentencing as outlined in section 38 of the ''Act''.&lt;ref name="The Youth Criminal Justice Act: Section 39"&gt;[http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/yj-jj/repos-depot/6legisln/01ycja-lsjpa/60103900.html Justice.gc.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614032726/http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/yj-jj/repos-depot/6legisln/01ycja-lsjpa/60103900.html |date=June 14, 2011 }}, Department of Justice.

39.(3) "In determining whether there is a reasonable alternative to custody, a youth justice court shall consider submissions relating to:

(a) the alternatives to custody that are available;

(b) the likelihood that the young person will comply with a non-custodial sentence, taking into account their compliance with previous non-custodial sentences; and

(c) the alternatives to custody that have been used in respect of young persons for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.&lt;ref name="justiceYCJA39"/&gt;

===Reports for sentencing hearings===
'''Reports for sentencing hearings''' are used in more serious cases in order to assist in determining an appropriate sentence. The most frequently used report for sentencing hearings is the pre-sentence report which is outlined in section 40. The judge ultimately decides whether a report is necessary, though the crown may request the report and the defence counsel may argue against the issuing of a pre-sentence report. All custodial sentences require a pre-sentencing report. A pre-sentencing report is conducted by a government employee who interviews the youth and any significant influences including family members, peers and other important persons who may contribute to their report. This report is a historical outline which may include information regarding the youth's family background, school history, attitude toward their offence, willingness to engage in available community services, interview with the victim and potentially a suggestive sentence. The pre-sentence report is given to the judge, prosecutor and defence lawyers as well as the youth and any involved parent or guardian before the sentencing hearing.&lt;ref name="site.ebrary.com"/&gt;

===Sentencing principles===

====Comparison with adult sentences====
Under sentencing principle (3) (a) of the ''Act'', the sentencing of a youth's punishment should not by any means be harsher or surpass that of the punishment for an adult who has been found [[Guilty (law)|guilty]] of committing the same crime as the youth&lt;ref&gt;"YCJA Explained – Legislation." Department of Justice Canada. December 13, 2008, [http://justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/yj-jj/repos-depot/6legisln/6000001a.html Justice.gc.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502144046/http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/yj-jj/repos-depot/6legisln/6000001a.html |date=May 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this sentencing principle was to eliminate discrepancies that were prevalent in the ''[[Young Offenders Act]]''. It was formed on the basis that youth under the Young Offenders Act were receiving longer sentences than adults for the same offences. In R. v. C.D.; [2005] a youth plead guilty to arson, breach of a recognisance, and the possession of a weapon.&lt;ref name="Umontreal.ca"&gt;"Supreme Court of Canada – Decisions – R. v. C.D."

====Similarity====
Under the sentencing principle 38 (2)(b)of the ''Young Criminal Justice Act'', the court requires that the sentence imposed must be similar in the region when young offenders are found guilty of the same crime under similar circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Legal Information Institute.  2005. "Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1" Federation of Law Societies of Canada, Retrieved July 24, 2009, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/sc-2002-c-1/latest/sc-2002-c-1.html CANLII.org]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that there should be a general level of consistency in sentences for young offenders who are guilty of the same crime.

====Proportionality====
The sentencing principle 38 (2)(c)under the ''Act'' states 'the sentence must be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the young person for that offence'&lt;ref&gt;Department of Justice Canada. 2008. "Youth Sentencing Options" Department of Justice Canada, Retrieved July 25, 2009, [http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/yj-jj/repos-depot/6legisln/01ycjalsjpa/60103800.html Justice.gc.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614033044/http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/yj-jj/repos-depot/6legisln/01ycjalsjpa/60103800.html |date=June 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sentencing principles clearly explain the basis that establish fair and justifiable sentences.

For young offenders, cases are viewed individually and sentencing is determined distinctively for different cases. Thus the more serious the offence is the more severe the punishment will be. Proportionality here means the size or the degree of the offence, thus the punishment should be proportional to the crime committed.&lt;ref&gt;Brodie, Scott. 2002.

Retrieved July 23, 2009, [http://ir.lib.sfu.ca/dspace/retrieve/2352/etd1943.pdf SFU.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; So a young offender who commits murder will be will severely punished compared to someone who steals.  How serious was the offence, the offender's level of participation and their intention, the harm done to the victim and the previous findings of the guilt are taken in account by the court to determine the sentencing of the offence.

====Substitute to custody====
Under the sentencing principle 38 2(d), the court is required to consider a substitute for the custody of young persons, while paying special attention to aboriginal offenders.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Justice Canada. 2008. "Youth Sentencing Options" Department of Justice Canada, Retrieved July 24, 2009, [http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/yj-jj/repos-depot/6legisln/01ycja-lsjpa/60103800.html Justice.gc.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614033008/http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/yj-jj/repos-depot/6legisln/01ycja-lsjpa/60103800.html |date=June 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the section also states that special concern should be given to youth by taking into account the gender, racial, and cultural differences. By responding to the needs of young aboriginal offenders, the focus of this section directs the court to use less harsh custodial sentences except when the offender poses a great threat to the public.&lt;ref name="ir.lib.sfu.ca"&gt;Brodie, Scott. 2002.

'''Sentencing Options 42(2)(k)'''
Section 42(2)(k) under the ''Act'' allows a young person to be placed on '''Probation''' (as specified by conditions and other matters related to probation orders under sections 55 and 56)  for a specified period of time not exceeding two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Department of Justice (Canada)|Department of Justice]] | year = 2008 | title = Youth Sentencing Options | accessdate = July 25, 2009 | url = http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/yj-jj/repos-depot/6legisln/01ycja-lsjpa/60104200.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110614032734/http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/yj-jj/repos-depot/6legisln/01ycja-lsjpa/60104200.html | archivedate = June 14, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Orders may range from being supervised by the provincial director; remain within the territorial jurisdiction of one or more courts; attending school; or having to reside at a place specified by the provincial director.  The Youth Justice Court prescribes these conditions as an order so the young person will learn to be of good behaviour and appear before the youth justice court when required to do so.

Probation is the sentence most frequently imposed by youth justice courts in Canada, as the conditions laid out are directly related to the young offenders criminal behaviour. This helps the offender to see the harm caused by their actions to the society and victims, and why they should not commit such crimes again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bala|first= Nicholas|year= 2002|title=Youth Criminal Justice Law - Essential of Canadian Law|accessdate= July 25, 2009  |url= http://site.ebrary.com|pages= 432–433}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a young offender fails to comply with the probation order, they can possibly be charged with breach of probation.

'''Sentencing Options 42 (2) (l)'''
To ensure that a young offenders illegal actions are followed by consequences that are "(1)just; (2)have meaningful consequences for the youth; (3) and promote the rehabilitation and reintegration of the youth into society"&lt;ref&gt;Barnhorst, Richard. 2004. "The Youth Criminal Justice Act: New Directions and Implementation Issues". Canadian Journal of Criminology and Criminal Justice 46(3):231–250.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Act'' has instilled several sentencing options.

According to Section 42(2), the twelfth sentencing option for youth is the placement in an '''(l) intensive support and supervision program'''.&lt;ref name="Youth Criminal Justice Act 2002"/&gt; This non-custodial sentencing option was introduce to the act along with options such as reprimand as well as non-residential programs or attendance orders.&lt;ref&gt;Minaker, Joanne C. &amp; Hogeveen, Bryan. 2009. Youth, Crime, and Society. Toronto: Pearson Education Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

This sentencing option is meant to be an alternative for custody, and was implemented to decrease high rates of custody caused by the ''Young Offenders Act''.&lt;ref name="Justice Canada 2002"&gt;Department of Justice Canada. (2002). "Youth Criminal Justice Act Explained: Youth Sentencing". Retrieved, [http://justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/yj-jj/repos-depot/pdf/3040301.pdf Justice.gc.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706181715/http://justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/yj-jj/repos-depot/pdf/3040301.pdf |date=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The young offender receives support and supervision from their community in hopes that they will alter their behaviour. The intent of this sentencing option is to provide more support than probation&lt;ref name="Justice Canada 2002"/&gt; and is often used to promote the use of community-based and rehabilitation sentences.&lt;ref name="Bala, Nicholas 2003"&gt;Bala, Nicholas. 2003. Youth Criminal Justice Law. Toronto: Irwin Law Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

This option encourages the rehabilitation of the youth and should target the specific needs or problems that seem to have contributed to their illegal behaviour.&lt;ref name="Justice Canada 2002"/&gt;

This sentencing option will only take place if the government has established programs and the courts have received approval of the provincial director.&lt;ref name="Bala, Nicholas 2003"/&gt; If not available, a probation order will be used along with various conditions to ensure the support and supervision of the youth in question.&lt;ref name="Justice Canada 2002"/&gt;

'''Sentencing Options 42 (2) (m)'''

This new sentencing option requires, at specific times, a young offender to attend court sanctioned programs. Over a six-month period a maximum of 240 hours that can be assigned.&lt;ref name="dss-snd.gc.ca"&gt;Department of Justice Canada. (2002). "Data Standards Secretariat", [http://www.dss-snd.gc.ca/publication/en/code/code0292.html GC.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103002646/http://www.dss-snd.gc.ca/publication/en/code/code0292.html |date=November 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This sentencing option is a nonresidential program that may be used as an alternative to custody and may be focused at specific high-risk times of day, such as when the youth may be unattended and unsupervised.&lt;ref name="YCJAexplained"&gt;Department of Justice Canada. (2002).

A Pilot attendance centre program in Ontario has reported considerable success and was well received by Ontario youth court judges.&lt;ref name="Justice Canada 2009"&gt;Department of Justice Canada. (2009). "Youth Sentencing options",  [http://justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/yj-jj/repos-depot/3modules/04you-ado/3040301h.html#regular Justice.gc.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719031551/http://justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/yj-jj/repos-depot/3modules/04you-ado/3040301h.html |date=July 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This measure may only occur if and attendance order program is available in the province. Provinces may decide not to implement this provision of the ''Act'' and are not required to make this option available.&lt;ref name="Justice Canada 2009"/&gt;

Due to potential high costs associated with this program, provinces may be eligible for additional federal funding.&lt;ref name="YCJAexplained"/&gt;

In the absence of such programs, a youth court judge may achieve similar ends by attaching specific conditions to a probation order handed down to a young person. The judge may also (as a condition of probation) require the young person to attend community programs.&lt;ref name="Justice Canada 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dss-snd.gc.ca"/&gt;

The overall goal of attendance programs is to supervise young persons at times when they may be more prone to commit crimes, such as when left unattended by parents.&lt;ref name="Justice Canada 2009"/&gt;

'''Sentencing Options 42(2)(n)'''
The ''Act'' states that all [[custodial sentence]]s must have a mandatory period of supervision in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Minaker, Joanne C. &amp; Hogeveen, Bryan. (2009).

When a judge sentences a young offender to a custody and supervision order under Section 42(2) (n) of the ''Act'', it means that the young offender must serve time in custody, followed by a period of supervision in the community.

Offences for which an adult would receive life imprisonment, except murder, are subject to a three-year maximum for the young offender.&lt;ref name="Justice Canada 2008"/&gt;

If a condition laid out by the judge or other officials is broken, or not met appropriately while under supervision in the community, reviews are held which determine whether the young offender's conditions should be changed or if he or she should be sent back into custody.&lt;ref name="Justice Canada 2008"/&gt;

'''Section 59: Review of Non-Custodial Youth Sentences'''
Under the ''Young Offender's Act'', approximately 20% of custody sentences were charged based on "failure to comply" issues surrounding probation orders&lt;ref name="noncustodial"&gt;Department of Justice Canada.2008. "Reviews of Non Custodial Sentencing" Canada:  Department of Justice. Retrieved July 25, 2009, [http://justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/yj-jj/repos-depot/3modules/04you-ado/3040301j.html Justice.gc.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706181727/http://justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/yj-jj/repos-depot/3modules/04you-ado/3040301j.html |date=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Youth Criminal Justice Act'' revised these procedures recognizing that most issues concerning the violation of probation conditions were not criminal acts themselves and that in doing so, were compromising the integrity of the justice system itself.  Therefore, the ''Act'' considers a review, rather than a charge, as a means of reducing the reliance on incarceration while being as fair as possible to the offender in assessing the seriousness of an offence&lt;ref name="noncustodial"/&gt;

The ''Act'' reveals that a review, "can be issued at any time after six months of the initial youth sentence or, with leave of a youth justice court judge"&lt;ref&gt;Department of Justice Canada.2008. "Review of Youth Sentences Not Involving Custody, YCJA, Section 59".  Canada: Department of Justice.

Also, reviews, in most cases, are exempt from those offenders who are charge with an offence outlined in section 42 of the ''Act''.  The full grounds for review are revealed under section 59.2 and are as follows:

*(a) on the ground that the circumstances that led to the youth sentence have changed materially;
*(b) on the ground that the young person in respect of whom the review is to be made is unable to comply with or is experiencing serious difficulty in complying with the terms of the youth sentence;
*(c) on the ground that the young person in respect of whom the review is to be made has contravened a condition of an order made under paragraph 42(2)(k) or (l) without reasonable excuse;
*(d) on the ground that the terms of the youth sentence are adversely affecting the opportunities available to the young person to obtain services, education or employment; or
*(e) on any other ground that the youth justice court considers appropriate&lt;ref&gt;Department of Justice Canada.2008. "Review of Youth Sentences Not Involving Custody, YCJA, Section 59".

===Adult sentence===
If a young person is found guilty of an indictable offence, an offence where an adult would be liable to receive more than two years, an order for an adult sentence shall be imposed on a young offender in the following cases:
* if the young person indicates that he or she doesn't want to make an application for a youth sentence or fails to make an indication,&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;Department of Justice Canada. 2002. " Youth Criminal Justice Act (2002, c.1)." Canada: Department of Justice Canada.

* In any other case, if the young person gives notice to the [[Youth Justice Court|youth justice court]] that he or she doesn't oppose the application for an adult sentence,&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; or if the purpose and principles set out in subparagraph 3(1)(b)(ii) and section 38 would not have sufficient length to hold the young person accountable for their offending behaviour in relation to an offence committed after the young offender has just acquired fourteen years of age.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

There are three categories of offences that may attract an adult sentence:

# Presumptive "b" offences: repeating of serious violent offence&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;
# Non-presumptive offences&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;
There are a few important changes to ''Act'' compared to the ''Young Offenders Act'', for example, the transfer process from a youth court to an adult court is eliminated. Instead, the youth court first determines whether or not the young person is guilty of the offence, and then, under certain circumstances, the youth court may impose an adult sentence,&lt;ref name="canada.justice.gc.ca"/&gt;

'''When the Crown does not seek an adult sentence for presumptive offence'''&lt;br /&gt;
Section 65 of the ''Act'' states that if the Attorney General gives notice to the court at any stage of the proceedings that the young offender, who is alleged to have committed a "presumptive offence" (as mentioned above) that an adult sentence would not be sought, the court shall order that the young individual is not liable to an adult sentence; the youth would immediately be tried in youth court and a youth sentence would be imposed.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Justice Canada.2008.

*If the young person has been found guilty of murder, [[attempted murder]], manslaughter, [[aggravated sexual assault]] or has committed at least two serious violent offences in the past
*The young person is suffering from a mental or [[psychological disorder]] or an emotional disturbance
*There are reasonable grounds to believe that the treatment plan might reduce the risk of the young person repeating the offence or committing other presumptive offences
*An appropriate program is available and the young person is suitable for admission.

===Breach of probation===
Section 137 of the ''Act'' outlines the definitions and consequences of failing to comply with a sentence or disposition, in other words, a breach of probation. It states that anyone failing to comply with their probation order is guilty of a punishable offence on a summary conviction.&lt;ref name="laws.justice.gc.ca"/&gt; These orders can include failure to report to and be supervised by the provincial director when on probation, failure to perform community service plus many more stated in section 42(2) of the act.&lt;ref name="laws.justice.gc.ca"&gt;Department of Justice, (2009) "Youth Criminal Justice Act".
