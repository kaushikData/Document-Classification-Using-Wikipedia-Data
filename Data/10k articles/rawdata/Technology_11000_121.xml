'''Alice Jacqueline Perry''' (24 October 1885 – 21 April 1969) was a poet and the first woman in Ireland to graduate with a degree in engineering.&lt;ref name="Engineers Ireland"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Engineers Ireland|title=Alice Perry (1885–1969)|url=http://www.realizedvision.com/ap.php|website=Engineers Ireland: Realised Vision|publisher=Engineers Ireland|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Wellpark]], [[Galway]] in 1885, Alice was one of five daughters of James and Martha Perry (née Park).&lt;ref name="Irish Architectural Archive"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Irish Architectural Archive|title=PERRY, ALICE JACQUELINE|url=http://www.dia.ie/architects/view/4332/PERRY-ALICEJACQUELINE|website=Dictionary of Irish Architects 1720–1940|publisher=Irish Architectural Archive|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was the County Surveyor in Galway West and co-founded the Galway Electric Light Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Irish Architectural Archive|title=PERRY, JAMES|url=http://www.dia.ie/architects/view/4331/PERRY-JAMES|website=Dictionary of Irish Architects 1720–1940|publisher=Irish Architectural Archive|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her uncle, [[John Perry (engineer)|John Perry]], was a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] and invented the navigational gyroscope.&lt;ref name="O'Connell" /&gt;

After graduating from the High School in Galway, she won a scholarship to study in [[Royal University of Ireland|Royal University, Galway]] in 1902. Having excelled in mathematics, she changed from studying for a degree in arts to an engineering degree. She graduated with first class honours in 1906.&lt;ref name="Engineers Ireland" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NUI Galway|title=Our history|url=http://www.nuigalway.ie/about-us/who-we-are/our-history.html|website=NUI Galway|publisher=NUI Galway|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family appear to have been academically gifted. Her sisters Molly and Nettie also went on to third level education; a third sister Agnes earned BA (1903) and MA (1905) in mathematics from Queen's College Galway (later UCG then NUIG), taught there in 1903–1904, was a Royal University of Ireland examiner in mathematics in 1906, and later became assistant headmistress at a secondary school in London.&lt;ref name="Galway Society"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=M. D.|last2=O'Halloran|first2=Joe|title=The Centenary of Galway College|journal=Journal of the Galway Archaeological and Historical Society|year=1999|volume=51|pages=24–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Following her graduation she was offered a senior postgraduate scholarship but owing to her father's death the following month, she did not take up this position.&lt;ref name="Irish Architectural Archive" /&gt; In December 1906 she succeeded her father temporarily as county surveyor for Galway County Council.&lt;ref name="Irish Architectural Archive" /&gt; She remained in this position for five&lt;ref name="Irish Architectural Archive" /&gt; or six&lt;ref name="Engineers Ireland" /&gt; months until a permanent appointment was made. She was an unsuccessful candidate for the permanent position and for a similar opportunity to be a surveyor in Galway East.&lt;ref name="Irish Architectural Archive" /&gt; She remains the only woman to have been a County Surveyor (County Engineer) in Ireland.&lt;ref name="Engineers Ireland" /&gt;

In 1908 she moved to London with her sisters, where she worked as a Lady Factory Inspector for the [[Home Office]].&lt;ref name="Engineers Ireland" /&gt; From there she moved to [[Glasgow]], at which point she converted from [[Presbyterianism]] to [[Christian Science]] in 1915.&lt;ref name="O'Connell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Connell|first1=Claire|editor1-last=Mulvihill|editor1-first=Mary|title=Lab Coats and Lace|date=2009|publisher=WITS|location=Dublin|isbn=978-0-9531953-1-2|pages=43–45|ref=O'Connell|chapter=First in Their Field}}&lt;!--|accessdate=8 February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She met and married John (Bob) Shaw on 30 September 1916.&lt;ref name="Irish Architectural Archive" /&gt; Shaw was a soldier who died in 1917 on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].&lt;ref name="Engineers Ireland" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Irish Architectural Archive" /&gt;

==Later life and death==
Perry retired from her inspector's position in 1921&lt;ref name="O'Connell" /&gt; and became interested in poetry, first publishing in 1922.&lt;ref name="Engineers Ireland" /&gt; In 1923 she moved to [[Boston]], the headquarters of Christian Science.&lt;ref name="O'Connell" /&gt; Until her death in 1969, Perry worked within the Christian Science movement as a poetry editor and practitioner,&lt;ref name="Irish Architectural Archive" /&gt; publishing seven books of poetry.&lt;ref name="Engineers Ireland" /&gt;

[[File:FMS B747-cockpit.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The autopilot control panel of a [[Boeing 747-200]] aircraft]]

An '''autopilot''' is a  system used to control the trajectory of an aircraft without constant 'hands-on' control by a human operator being required. Autopilots do not replace human operators, but instead they assist them in controlling the aircraft. This allows them to focus on broader aspects of operations such as monitoring the trajectory, weather and systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/advanced_avionics_handbook/media/aah_ch04.pdf |title=Automated Flight Controls |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=faa.gov |publisher= Federal Aviation Administration |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The autopilot is often used in conjunction with the [[autothrottle]], when present, which is the analogous system controlling the power delivered by the engines.
 
The autopilot system on airplanes is sometimes colloquially referred to as "George".&lt;ref name=george&gt;{{cite web|title=George the Autopilot|url=http://fly.historicwings.com/2012/08/george-the-autopilot/|work=Historic Wings|publisher=Thomas Van Hare|accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First autopilots==
{{see also|Gyroscopic autopilot}}
[[File:Honeywell C-1 Autopilot Control Panel.jpg|thumb|A World War II-era Honeywell C-1 autopilot control panel]]
In the early days of aviation, aircraft required the continuous attention of a pilot to fly safely. As aircraft range increased, allowing flights of many hours, the constant attention led to serious fatigue. An autopilot is designed to perform some of the tasks of the pilot.

The first aircraft autopilot was developed by [[Sperry Corporation]] in 1912. The autopilot connected a [[gyroscopic]] [[heading indicator]] and [[attitude indicator]] to hydraulically operated [[elevator (aircraft)|elevators]] and [[rudder]]. ([[Aileron]]s were not connected as wing [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] was counted upon to produce the necessary roll stability.) It permitted the aircraft to fly straight and level on a compass course without a pilot's attention, greatly reducing the pilot's workload.

[[Lawrence Sperry]] (the son of famous inventor [[Elmer Sperry]]) demonstrated it in 1914 at an aviation safety contest held in [[Paris]]. At the contest, Sperry demonstrated the credibility of the invention by flying the aircraft with his hands away from the controls and visible to onlookers of the contest. Elmer Sperry Jr., the son of Lawrence Sperry, and Capt Shiras continued work after the war on the same autopilot, and in 1930 they tested a more compact and reliable autopilot which kept a US Army Air Corps aircraft on a true heading and altitude for three hours.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4ykDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA22 "Now - The Automatic Pilot"] ''Popular Science Monthly'', February 1930,  p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] in the [[United Kingdom]] developed an autopilot called a '''pilots' assister''' that used a pneumatically-spun gyroscope to move the flight controls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qOIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA950 "Robot Air Pilot Keeps Plane on True Course"] ''Popular Mechanics'', December 1930, p. 950.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further development of the autopilot was performed, such as improved control algorithms and hydraulic servomechanisms. Also, inclusion of additional instrumentation such as the radio-navigation aids made it possible to fly during night and in bad weather. In 1947 a US Air Force [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster|C-54]] made a transatlantic flight, including takeoff and landing, completely under the control of an autopilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stevens | first=Brian |author2=Lewis, Frank | title=Aircraft Control and Simulation | location=New York | publisher=Wiley | year=1992 | isbn=978-0-471-61397-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flightglobal/Archive

&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Bill Lear]] developed his F-5 automatic pilot and automatic approach control system, and was awarded the [[Collier Trophy]] for 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerofiles.com/collier-trophy.html Collier Trophy awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1920s, the [[Standard Oil]] tanker ''J.A. Moffet'' became the first ship to use an autopilot.

==Modern autopilots==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
[[File:A340 FCU.jpg|thumb|The modern flight control unit of an Airbus A340]]Not all of the passenger aircraft flying today have an autopilot system. Older and smaller [[general aviation]] aircraft especially are still hand-flown, and even small [[airliner]]s with fewer than twenty seats may also be without an autopilot as they are used on short-duration flights with two pilots. The installation of autopilots in aircraft with more than twenty seats is generally made mandatory by international aviation regulations. There are three levels of control in autopilots for smaller aircraft. A single-axis autopilot controls an aircraft in the [[flight dynamics|roll]] axis only; such autopilots are also known colloquially as "wing levellers," reflecting their limitations. A two-axis autopilot controls an aircraft in the [[flight dynamics|pitch]] axis as well as roll, and may be little more than a "wing leveller" with limited pitch oscillation-correcting ability; or it may receive inputs from on-board radio navigation systems to provide true automatic flight guidance once the aircraft has taken off until shortly before landing; or its capabilities may lie somewhere between these two extremes. A three-axis autopilot adds control in the [[flight dynamics|yaw]] axis and is not required in many small aircraft.

Autopilots in modern complex aircraft are three-axis and generally divide a flight into [[taxiing|taxi]], takeoff, climb, cruise (level flight), descent, approach, and landing phases. Autopilots exist that automate all of these flight phases except taxi and takeoff. An autopilot-controlled landing on a runway and controlling the aircraft on rollout (i.e. keeping it on the centre of the runway) is known as a CAT IIIb landing or [[Autoland]], available on many major airports' runways today, especially at airports subject to adverse weather phenomena such as [[fog]]. Landing, rollout, and taxi control to the aircraft parking position is known as CAT IIIc. This is not used to date, but may be used in the future. An autopilot is often an integral component of a [[Flight Management System]].

Modern autopilots use [[computer]] [[software]] to control the aircraft. The software reads the aircraft's current position, and then controls a [[aircraft flight control system|flight control system]] to guide the aircraft. In such a system, besides classic flight controls, many autopilots incorporate thrust control capabilities that can control throttles to optimize the airspeed.

The autopilot in a modern large aircraft typically reads its position and the aircraft's attitude from an [[inertial guidance system]]. Inertial guidance systems accumulate errors over time. They will incorporate error reduction systems such as the carousel system that rotates once a minute so that any errors are dissipated in different directions and have an overall nulling effect. Error in gyroscopes is known as drift. This is due to physical properties within the system, be it mechanical or laser guided, that corrupt positional data. The disagreements between the two are resolved with [[digital signal processing]], most often a six-dimensional [[Kalman filter]]. The six dimensions are usually roll, pitch, yaw, [[altitude]], [[latitude]], and [[longitude]]. Aircraft may fly routes that have a required performance factor, therefore the amount of error or actual performance factor must be monitored in order to fly those particular routes. The longer the flight, the more error accumulates within the system. Radio aids such as DME, DME updates, and [[GPS]] may be used to correct the aircraft position.

===Control Wheel Steering===
A midway between fully automated flight and manual flying is '''Control Wheel Steering''' (CWS). Although it is becoming less observed as a stand-alone option in modern airliners, CWS is still a function on many aircraft today. Generally, an autopilot that is CWS equipped, has three positions being off, CWS, and CMD. In CMD (Command) mode the autopilot has full control of the aircraft, and receives its input from either the heading/altitude setting, radio and navaids, or the FMS (Flight Management System). In CWS mode, the pilot controls the autopilot through inputs on the yoke or the stick. These inputs are translated to a specific heading and attitude, which the autopilot will then hold until instructed to do otherwise. This provides stability in pitch and roll. Some aircraft employ a form of CWS even in manual mode, such as the MD-11 which uses a constant CWS in roll. In many ways, a modern Airbus fly-by-wire aircraft in [[Flight control modes#Normal law|Normal Law]] is always in CWS mode. The major difference is that in this system the limitations of the aircraft are guarded by the [[flight computer]], and the pilot can not steer the aircraft past these limits.{{citation needed|reason=while this is at least roughly correct, without some citations, it's drawing a lot of conclusions|date=July 2015}}

===Computer system details===
The hardware of an autopilot varies from implementation to implementation, but is generally designed with redundancy and reliability as foremost considerations.  For example, the Rockwell Collins AFDS-770 Autopilot Flight Director System used on the [[Boeing 777]] uses triplicated FCP-2002 microprocessors which have been formally verified and are fabricated in a radiation-resistant process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rockwellcollins.com/ecat/at/AFDS-770.html | title=Rockwell Collins AFDS-770 Autopilot Flight Director System| publisher=Rockwell Collins | date=3 February 2010 | accessdate=14 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100822151603/http://www.rockwellcollins.com/ecat/AT/AFDS-770.html| archivedate= 22 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Software and hardware in an autopilot is tightly controlled, and extensive test procedures are put in place.

Some autopilots also use design diversity. In this safety feature, critical software processes will not only run on separate computers and possibly even using different architectures, but each computer will run software created by different engineering teams, often being programmed in different programming languages. It is generally considered unlikely that different engineering teams will make the same mistakes. As the software becomes more expensive and complex, design diversity is becoming less common because fewer engineering companies can afford it.  The flight control computers on the [[Space Shuttle]] used this design:  there were five computers, four of which redundantly ran identical software, and a fifth backup running software that was developed independently.  The software on the fifth system provided only the basic functions needed to fly the Shuttle, further reducing any possible commonality with the software running on the four primary systems.

== Stability augmentation systems ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
A stability augmentation system (SAS) is another type of automatic flight control system; however, instead of maintaining the aircraft on a predetermined attitude or flight path, the SAS will actuate the aircraft flight controls to dampen out aircraft buffeting regardless of the attitude or flight path.  SAS can automatically stabilize the aircraft in one or more axes. The most common type of SAS is the [[yaw damper]] which is used to eliminate the [[Dutch roll]] tendency of swept-wing aircraft. Some yaw dampers are integral to the autopilot system while others are stand-alone systems.

Yaw dampers usually consist of a yaw rate sensor (either a gyroscope or angular accelerometer), a computer/amplifier and a servo actuator. The [[yaw damper]] uses yaw rate sensor to sense when the aircraft begins a Dutch roll. A computer processes the signals from the yaw rate sensor to determine the amount of rudder movement that is required to dampen out the Dutch roll. The computer then commands the servo actuator to move the rudder that amount. The Dutch roll is dampened out and the aircraft becomes stable about the yaw axis. Because Dutch roll is an instability that is inherent to all swept-wing aircraft, most swept-wing aircraft have some sort of yaw damper system installed.

There are two types of yaw dampers: series yaw dampers and parallel yaw dampers. The servo actuator of a parallel yaw damper will actuate the rudder independently of the rudder pedals while the servo actuator of a series yaw damper is clutched to the rudder control quadrant and will result in pedal movement when the system commands the rudder to move.

Some aircraft have stability augmentation systems that will stabilize the aircraft in more than a single axis. B-52s, for example, require both pitch and yaw SAS in order to provide a stable bombing platform. Many helicopters have pitch, roll and yaw SAS systems. Pitch and roll SAS systems operate much the same way as the yaw damper described above; however, instead of dampening out Dutch roll, they will dampen pitch and roll oscillations or buffeting to improve the overall stability of the aircraft.

== Autopilot for ILS landings ==

[[Autoland|Instrument-aided landings]] are defined in categories by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]], or ICAO. These are dependent upon the required visibility level and the degree to which the landing can be conducted automatically without input by the pilot.

'''CAT I''' - This category permits pilots to land with a [[Instrument approach#Decision height or altitude|decision height]] of {{convert|200|ft}} and a forward visibility or Runway Visual Range (RVR) of {{convert|550|m}}. Autopilots are not required.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aeronautical Information manual|url=http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/AIM/Index.htm|website=faa.gov|publisher=FAA|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CAT II''' - This category permits pilots to land with a decision height between {{convert|200|ft}} and {{convert|100|ft}} and a RVR of {{convert|300|m}}. Autopilots have a fail passive requirement.

'''CAT IIIa''' -This category permits pilots to land with a decision height as low as {{convert|50|ft}} and a RVR of {{convert|200|m}}. It needs a fail-passive autopilot. There must be only a 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; probability of landing outside the prescribed area.

'''CAT IIIb''' - As IIIa but with the addition of automatic roll out after touchdown incorporated with the pilot taking control some distance along the runway. This category permits pilots to land with a decision height less than 50 feet or no decision height and a forward visibility of {{convert|250|ft}} in Europe (76 metres, compare this to aircraft size, some of which are now over {{convert|70|m}} long) or {{convert|300|ft}} in the United States. For a landing-without-decision aid, a fail-operational autopilot is needed. For this category some form of runway guidance system is needed: at least fail-passive but it needs to be fail-operational for landing without decision height or for RVR below {{convert|100|m}}.

'''CAT IIIc''' - As IIIb but without decision height or visibility minimums, also known as "zero-zero". Not yet available on commercial airliners, but may be available in the near future.

Fail-passive autopilot: in case of failure, the aircraft stays in a controllable position and the pilot can take control of it to go around or finish landing. It is usually a dual-channel system.

Fail-operational autopilot: in case of a failure below alert height, the approach, flare and landing can still be completed automatically. It is usually a triple-channel system or dual-dual system.

==Radio-controlled models==
In [[radio-controlled model]]ling, and especially RC [[Radio-controlled aircraft|aircraft]] and [[Radio-controlled helicopter|helicopters]], an autopilot is usually a set of extra hardware and software that deals with pre-programming the model's flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Alan Parekh |title=Autopilot RC Plane |url=http://hackedgadgets.com/2008/04/14/autopilot-rc-plane/ | work=Hacked Gadgets | date=April 14, 2008 | accessdate=14 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100727204021/http://hackedgadgets.com/2008/04/14/autopilot-rc-plane/| archivedate= 27 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bedrock mortar''' ('''BRM''') is an  [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] circular depression in a rock [[outcrop]] or naturally occurring slab, used by people in the past for grinding of [[grain]], [[acorn]]s or other food products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritageedu.com/glossary.htm#bedrock Archaeology online glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;  There are often a cluster of a considerable number of such holes in proximity indicating that people gathered in groups to conduct food grinding in [[prehistoric]] cultures. Correspondingly the alternative name '''gossip stone''' is sometimes applied, indicating the social context of the food grinding activity.  Typical dimensions of the circular indentations are approximately 12 centimeters in diameter by 10 centimeters deep, although a considerable range of depths of the cavities have been documented .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~e472/cdf/suggest/techniques/  ''Discovering Prehistoric Sites: Objective and Subjective Survey Techniques'', Daniel G. Foster, Brian D. Dillon, and Linda C. Sandelin, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection,  June 13, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The bedrock mortar has been identified in a number of world regions, but has been particularly intensely documented in the [[Americas]].  An alternative term for the bedrock mortar site is '''bedrock milling station'''.

==Bedrock metate==
A bedrock mortar should not be confused with a bedrock [[metate]], which is a flat, [[Trough (food)|trough]]-shaped depression often found with bedrock mortars.&lt;ref name="fs.fed.us"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Cultural Resources of the Santa Rita Experimental Range| work=John H.

[[Image:Sony CCUs.jpg|thumb|right|Equipment CCU]]
The '''camera control unit''' (CCU) is typically part of a [[live television]] broadcast chain. It is responsible for powering the [[professional video camera]], handling signals sent over the camera cable to and from the camera, and can be used to control various camera parameters remotely.

== Use in historical productions ==
Before cameras became self contained units broadcast quality cameras required vast racks of control units just to generate a usable picture. In outside broadcast production, these racks took up an entire section of the OB truck and were operated by a small team of skilled engineers. These vision engineers had two roles. Firstly, they setup the CCUs at the start of a production and ensured that the picture created was of broadcast quality. This process included a lengthy 'lining up' process in which the vision engineer would work with the camera operator, to adjust the settings on both the actual camera and the CCU in tandem. During production, it was the vision engineers job to operate the CCUs and control both the focus and the colour balance. So skilled and labour intensive was this role that each CCU required its own dedicated vision engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=John|first=Ellis,|last2=Nick|first2=Hall,|date=2017-11-09|title=ADAPT|url=https://doi.org/10.17637/rh.c.3925603.v1|journal=figshare|language=en-US|doi=10.17637/rh.c.3925603.v1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Advantages over using independent cameras with automatic settings ==
Modern cameras are more self-contained than their predecessors and most can operate without a CCU. Even when not required, a CCU can be of benefit for the following reasons.
* In a system with [[multiple-camera setup]], the cameras can be matched{{snd}}made to look the same in terms of colour balance and picture intensity without having to ask the [[camera operator]]s to make the adjustment.
* The camera operators are freed from the control of iris and black level, leaving them free to concentrate on other aspects of camerawork such as blocking and image composition
* All signals that operate between the camera and CCU are carried in one [[multicore cable]], [[triax]] or [[fiber optic]] cable.

== Scope of CCU functions ==
[[File:Sony camera rdp panels.jpg|thumb|A bank of RCPs for racking Sony studio cameras.]]
A CCU is often used in conjunction with a remote control panel (RCP), a [[waveform monitor]] and a [[vectorscope]] to rack and match many cameras together remotely.

Common adjustable parameters include:
* Iris (see [[aperture]])
* [[Color temperature]] filters
* [[Neutral density filter]]
* Master black (pedestal)
* Black level trim (for red, green and blue components)
* Gain trim (for red, green and blue components)
* Master gain

In addition to these, there are usually options internally generating a [[test card]] for testing, return feeds or talkback. For more complex production, preset scene files can be recalled to quickly change the settings of the camera on the fly.

== Connections to a CCU ==
Broadcast cameras typically carry several signals over the camera cable in addition to the camera output itself.

Typically, RGB signals are transmitted over the camera cable. The CCU will usually convert these to SDI, YUV or composite for interfacing to other video equipment.

Typical signals can be both [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]] and [[analog signal]]s:  
* Video out ([[Serial digital interface]] (SDI)
* Video out ([[composite video]])
* Video out ([[component video]])
* Audio out ([[microphone]] on board)
* Video in ([[genlock]] in the form of [[color burst]])
* Return video in (composite)
* Return video in
* [[Interruptible feedback]] [[Intercom]]

[[Image:Carvery meal.jpg|thumb|275px|A typical carvery meal, from a pub in [[South Africa]]]]

A '''carvery''' is a meal served in a pub or a [[restaurant]] where cooked [[meat]] is freshly sliced to order for customers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bulleid | first=A. | title=Serving Food and Drink: Table and Function : Student Guide | publisher=Stanley Thornes | series=Catering and hospitality, NVQ/SVQ2 | year=1996 | isbn=978-0-7487-2591-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VtytFppNaTcC&amp;pg=PA210 | access-date=November 6, 2018 | pages=210-211}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes offering unlimited servings in a [[buffet]] style for a fixed price.&lt;ref name="Hayter 2017"&gt;{{cite book | last=Hayter | first=R. | title=Food and Drink Service | publisher=Macmillan Education UK | year=2017 | isbn=978-1-349-80473-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IE9dDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55 | access-date=November 6, 2018 | page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most commonly used in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Cyprus]], and Commonwealth countries like [[Canada]] and [[Australia]], but it is also found in the [[United States]].

== Description ==
Carveries are often found in [[pub]]s and hotels,&lt;ref name="Davis Lockwood Pantelidis Alcott 2008"&gt;{{cite book | last=Davis | first=B. | last2=Lockwood | first2=A. | last3=Pantelidis | first3=I. | last4=Alcott | first4=P. | title=Food and Beverage Management | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | year=2008 | isbn=978-1-136-40283-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rRGgxwcDuZ4C&amp;pg=PA237 | access-date=November 6, 2018 | page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are particularly commonly held at weekends, when they offer traditional [[Sunday roast]]s to a potentially large number of people. The meat is usually accompanied by a choice of [[potato]]es (generally at least boiled, [[mashed potato|mashed]] and roasted) also stuffing followed by other vegetables (commonly including [[carrot]]s, [[parsnips]], [[peas]] and other traditional British vegetables), with [[gravy]] and a [[sauce]] considered a traditional accompaniment to the various meats (for example, [[mint sauce]] to accompany roast [[lamb (food)|lamb]], [[apple sauce]] to accompany roast [[pork]] and so on).

==Examples==
Carveries existed as early as 1956 in London, in two [[J. Lyons and Co.|Lyons]] Corner Houses.  One of the restaurants, in each of the [[Strand, London|Strand]] and the [[Tottenham Court Road]] Lyons, was a carvery.  They provided a three-course meal with beverage, but all but the carvery items were served by a [[Nippy]] (waitress).  Even the carvery table had an employee to help those having difficulty in the actual carving.  The price at this time was five shillings.

In the 1970s and later, many more carveries appeared in London. One well-known carvery was situated in the [[Regent Palace Hotel]].  The restaurant there was on the ground floor, the [[Art Deco]] ceiling of which has been reassembled in the new Air W1 building.
[[Image:Sign of the Beefcarver restaurant Dearborn.JPG|thumb|right|Sign of the Beefcarver restaurant, [[Dearborn, Michigan]]]]

Later they were operated by [[pub chain]]s such as [[Harvester (restaurant)|Harvester]], [[Brewer's Fayre]] and [[Beefeater (restaurant)|Beefeater]].  The [[Toby Carvery]] brand took over many former Beefeater sites.

The chain of [[Fuzzy's Grub]] in [[London]] is a noted carvery, being voted "Best Traditional British Restaurant, but all but the carv in London" in [[Harden's]] 2007 guide.

Carveries are also commonly offered by many local [[pub]]s.

=== United States ===
Some restaurants in the US use the term or concept, and it is a staple at some [[buffet]]s. Examples include:
* The House of Prime Rib, a [[Standing rib roast|prime rib]] carvery in San Francisco, California
* [[Lawry's]] may be described as a carvery (serving almost exclusively roast beef), and uses the term for one branch, Lawry's Carvery
* The Sign of the Beefcarver, a carvery chain in Michigan

Most California-style [[hofbrau]] restaurants may also be considered carveries.

A '''chopstick rest''' is tableware, similar to a [[knife rest]] or a [[spoon rest]], used to keep [[chopstick]] tips off the table and to prevent used chopsticks from contaminating or rolling off tables. Chopstick rests are found more commonly in restaurants than in homes. They come in various shapes and are made from clay, wood, plastic, metal, glass, porcelain or precious stones such as [[jade]]. If the chopsticks come in paper sleeves, some people fold the sleeves into chopstick rests.&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} [http://www.geocities.jp/nisemonon/hashi.htm A video showing the folding of a chopstick rest]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[East Asia]], chopstick rests are usually used at formal dinners. They are placed on the front-left side of the dishes, with the chopsticks parallel to the table edge and the points toward the left, or to the right side of the dishes, with the chopstick points towards to the front.

The '''Dong-Feng 21''' ('''DF-21'''; [[NATO]] reporting name '''CSS-5''' - Dong-Feng ({{zh|t=東風|s=东风|l=East Wind}})) is a two-stage, [[solid-fuel rocket]], single-warhead [[medium-range ballistic missile]] (MRBM) in the [[Dongfeng (missile)|Dong Feng]] series developed by China Changfeng Mechanics and Electronics Technology Academy. Development started in the late 1960s and was completed around 1985-86, but it was not deployed until 1991. It was developed from the [[submarine]]-launched [[JL-1]] missile, and is China's first solid-fuel land-based [[missile]]. The [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] in 2008 estimated that China had 60-80 missiles and 60 launchers;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title= Military Power of the People’s Republic of China 2008 |url=http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/pdfs/China_Military_Report_08.pdf | publisher=Office of the Secretary of Defense |page=56 (p66 of PDF) | postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately 10-11 missiles can be built annually.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/23a01071-5dac-433a-8452-09c542163ae8/From-Bottle-Rockets-to-Lightning-Bolts--China-s-Mi Pradun: From Bottle Rockets to Lightning Bolts, p.12] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304204038/https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/23a01071-5dac-433a-8452-09c542163ae8/From-Bottle-Rockets-to-Lightning-Bolts--China-s-Mi |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally developed as a strategic weapon, the DF-21's later variants were designed for both nuclear and conventional missions. It is thought able to carry a high explosive and [[cluster munition|submunition]] warheads, as well as a nuclear warhead of 300&amp;nbsp;kt. The latest DF-21D was said to be the world's first [[anti-ship ballistic missile]] (ASBM). The DF-21 has also been developed into a space-capable [[anti-satellite weapon]]/anti-missile weapon carrier.

Though the launcher itself is mobile to reduce vulnerability, an actual launch unit requires support vehicles that can cover a 300×300-meter area, making it hard to move quickly and easier to detect.  Also, the launcher is not made to travel off-road and requires solid ground when firing to prevent backblast and debris damage due to the [[hard launch]], restricting its firing locations to roads and pre-made launch pads.&lt;ref name="fas28sep10"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fas.org/blogs/security/2010/09/df21c/ |title=DF-21C Missile Deploys to Central China |last1=Kristensen |first1=Hans M. |date=September 28, 2010 |website=fas.org |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Naval Institute]] in 2009 stated that such a [[warhead]] would be large enough to destroy an aircraft carrier in one hit and that there was "currently ... no defense against it" if it worked as theorized. The [[United States Navy]] has responded by switching its focus from a close blockade force of [[Zumwalt class destroyer|shallow water vessels]] to return to building deep water [[Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System|ballistic missile defense destroyers]].&lt;ref name="USNI"/&gt; The United States has also assigned most of its ballistic missile defense capable ships to the Pacific, extended the BMD program to all Aegis destroyers and increased procurement of [[RIM-161|SM-3]] BMD missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33153.pdf|title="China Naval Modernization: Implications for U.S. Navy Capabilities—Background and Issues for Congress."|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States also has a large network optimized for tracking ballistic missile launches which may give carrier groups sufficient warning in order to move away from the target area while the missile is in flight.&lt;ref&gt;Pomfret, John. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/24/AR2010122403009.html "Military strength is eluding China."] ''[[Washington Post]]'', 25 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Kinetic defenses against the DF-21D would be difficult. The Navy's primary ballistic missile interceptor, the SM-3, would not be effective since it is designed to intercept missiles in the mid-course phase in space, so it would have to be launched almost immediately to hit before reentry or from an Aegis ship positioned under its flight path. The [[RIM-67|SM-2 Block 4]] can intercept missiles reentering the atmosphere, but the warhead will be performing high-G maneuvers that may complicate interception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/chinas-carrier-killer-really-threat-the-us-navy-13765 Is China's "Carrier-Killer" Really a Threat to the U.S. Navy?] - Nationalinterest.org, 2 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of such missile has been said by some experts to potentially lead to nuclear exchange, regional arms races with India and Japan, and the end of the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|INF Treaty]] between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], to which the [[People's Republic of China]] is not a party.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Erikson |first1=Andrew S. |last2=Yang |first2=David D. |year=2009 |title=On the Verge of a Game-Changer |journal=Proceedings Magazine |volume=135 |issue=5 |pages= |publisher=United States Naval Institute |doi= |url=http://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2009-05/verge-game-changer |accessdate=3 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Can a treaty contain China's missiles? |author=Mark Stokes |author2=Dan Blumenthal |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/31/AR2010123104108.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=2 January 2011 |accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China has recently launched a series of satellites to support its ASBM efforts:
* [[Yaogan]]-VII [[electro-optical]] satellite - 9 December 2009
* Yaogan-VIII [[synthetic aperture radar]] satellite - 14 December 2009
* Yaogan-IX [[Naval Ocean Surveillance System]] (NOSS) constellation (3 satellites in formation) - 5 March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;"Chinese Anti-ship Missile Could Alter U.S. Power", Wendell Minnick, [[Defense News]], p6a, 5 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Yaogan-XVI [[Naval Ocean Surveillance System]] (NOSS) constellation  - 25 November 2012

China is reported to be working on an [[Over-the-horizon radar]] to locate the targets for the ASBM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33153.pdf|title=CRS RL33153 China Naval Modernization: Implications for U.S. Navy Capabilities--Background and Issues for Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An apparent test of the missile was made against a target in the [[Gobi desert]] in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/asia-pacific/130130/chinas-test-df-21d-missile-mock-us-aircraft-carrier-gobi-d|title=China tests DF-21D missile on mock US aircraft carrier in Gobi desert|author=Daniel DeFraia|work=GlobalPost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2013, a Russian Military Analysis report of the DF-21D concluded that the only way to successfully counter it would be through [[electronic countermeasures]]. Conventional interceptions of high-speed objectives have worked in the past, with the Russian report citing the [[Operation Burnt Frost|2008 interception of a malfunctioning satellite]] by a U.S. cruiser, but in that situation the warship had extensive knowledge of its location and trajectory. Against an attack from the Mach 10 DF-21D without knowing the missile's launch point, the U.S. Navy's only way to evade it would be through electronic countermeasures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php/news/defence-news/year-2013-news/december-2013-navy-naval-forces-maritime-industry-technology-security-global-news/1423-electronic-countermeasures-maybe-only-way-to-counter-chinese-df-21d-ballistic-missile-.html Electronic Countermeasures maybe only way to counter Chinese DF-21D Ballistic Missile] - Navyrecognition.com, 14 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of the DF-21D has some analysts claiming that the "carrier killer" missiles have rendered the American use of aircraft carriers obsolete, as they are too vulnerable in the face of the new weapon and not worth the expense. Military leaders in the U.S. Navy and Air Force, however, do not see it as a "game changer" to completely count carriers out. First, the missile may not be able to single-handedly destroy its target, as the warhead is believed to be enough to only inflict a "mission kill" to make a carrier unable to conduct flight operations. Secondly, there is the problem of finding its target. The DF-21D has a range estimated between {{convert|1,035|to|1,726|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}}, so a carrier battle group would need to be located through other means before launching. [[Over-the-horizon radar]]s cannot pinpoint their exact locations, and would have to be used in conjunction with Chinese recon satellites; recon aircraft and submarines could also look for them, but they are vulnerable to the carrier's defenses. Finally, although the DF-21D has radar and optical sensors for tracking, it has not yet been tested against a ship target moving at-sea at up to {{convert|55|km/h|kn mph|abbr=on}}, let alone ones using clutter and countermeasures. The "kill chain" of the missile requires processing and constantly updating data of a carrier's location, preparing the launch, programming information, and then firing, a chain the U.S. military's [[AirSea Battle]] concept involves disrupting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforcemag.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2013/December%202013/1213china.aspx China’s Carrier Killer: Threat and Theatrics] - AirForcemag.com, December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Some U.S. analysts believe that the DF-21D doesn't fly any faster than Mach 5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://breakingdefense.com/2014/01/house-gop-defense-heavies-slam-china-after-hypersonic-missile-test/ House GOP Defense Heavies Slam China After Hypersonic Missile Test] - Breakingdefense.com, 14 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The DF-21D reentry vehicle appears to bear similarities to the American [[Pershing II]] missile's RV, which was withdrawn from service in 1988. The Pershing II's RV weighed {{convert|1,400|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and was fitted with four control fins to perform a 25-G pull-up after reentering the atmosphere, traveling at Mach 8 and then gliding {{convert|30|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} to the target to pitch into a terminal dive. Army training manuals about the missile are available on the internet and [[Pershing missile bibliography|public open-source literature]] extensively describes it; the DF-21 has a comparable range and payload. Though much is made of the DF-21D's damage infliction ability based solely on velocity and kinetic energy, the [[Australian Strategic Policy Institute]] has calculated that the energy of an inert {{convert|500|kg|lb|abbr=on}} RV impacting at Mach 6 had similar energy to the combined kinetic and explosive power of the American subsonic [[Harpoon (missile)|Harpoon]] anti-ship missile, which is one-quarter the energy of the Russian supersonic {{convert|12,800|lb|kg|abbr=on}} [[Kh-22]] missile traveling at Mach 4 with a {{convert|2,200|lb|kg|abbr=on}} warhead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/AW_01_27_2014_p18-657278.xml&amp;p=1 U.S. Navy Sees Chinese HGV As Part Of Wider Threat] - Aviationweek.com, 27 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saudi Arabian purchase==
{{Main|Royal Saudi Strategic Missile Force}}
In January 2014, [[Newsweek]] revealed that [[Saudi Arabia]] had secretly bought a number of DF-21 medium-range ballistic missiles in 2007. They also said that the American [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] had allowed the deal to go through as long as the missiles were modified to not be able to carry nuclear warheads. Saudi Arabia had previously secretly acquired Chinese [[DF-3A]] ballistic missiles in 1988, which was publicly revealed. While the DF-3 has a longer range, it was designed to carry a nuclear payload, and so had poor accuracy (0.6-2.4&amp;nbsp;miles (1000–4000&amp;nbsp;m) [[Circular Error Probable|CEP]]) if used with a conventional warhead. It would only be useful against large area targets like cities and military bases. This made them useless during the [[Gulf War]] for retaliating against Iraqi [[Scud]] missile attacks, as they would cause mass civilian casualties and would not be as effective as the ongoing coalition air attacks. After the war, the Saudis and the CIA worked together to covertly allow the purchase of Chinese DF-21s. The DF-21 is solid-fueled instead of liquid-fueled like the DF-3, so it takes less time to prepare for launch. It is accurate to 30 meters CEP, allowing it to attack specific targets like compounds or palaces. The Saudis are not known to possess mobile launchers, but may use the same 12 launchers originally bought with the DF-3s. The number of DF-21 missiles that were bought is unknown. Newsweek speculates that details of the deal being made public is part of Saudi deterrence against [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/exclusive-cia-helped-saudis-chinese-missile-deal-227283 CIA Helped Saudis in Secret Chinese Missile Deal] - Newsweek.com, 29 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://strategypage.com/htmw/htart/articles/20140210.aspx Saudi Ballistic Missiles Secretly Upgraded] - Strategypage.com, 10 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=du-20140502&gt;{{cite news |url=http://defense-update.com/20140502_saudi-arabia-unveils-part-strategic-missile-force-deterrent-move-iran.html |title=Saudi Arabia unveils part of strategic missile force - a deterrent move against Iran? |publisher=Defense Update |date=2 May 2014 |accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drawdown cards''' are used for testing [[paint]]s and [[coating]]s through [[wet film]] preparation.

Black and white cards are used to measure both [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] and [[contrast ratio]]. By measuring reflectance values of both parts of the card one can gain a quantitative opacity value of a paint sample.

[[File:Centre for Regenerative Medicine.jpg|thumb|The [[Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine]], at [[Little France]] in Edinburgh, was opened in May 2012; it is home to the Institute for Stem Cell Research, part of the Edinburgh Science Triangle.]]
The '''Edinburgh Science Triangle''' ('''EST''') is a multi-disciplinary partnership between universities, research institutes, the [[Scottish National Health Service|National Health Service]], science parks, the national economic development agency [[Scottish Enterprise]], and [[Scottish Government|central]] and [[Local government in Scotland|local government]] in Edinburgh and neighbouring council areas. The three points of the "triangle" are [[Livingston, Scotland|Livingston]] in [[West Lothian]], [[Musselburgh]] in [[East Lothian]], and the [[Easter Bush campus]] in [[Midlothian]].

The collaborative project aims to attract new indigenous and [[inward investment]], and to build a professional scientific community based on academic research and commercial enterprises. The target sectors for the project are the [[life sciences]], [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]], [[Microelectronics|micro-]] and [[optoelectronics]] and [[Energy industry|energy]].

The Edinburgh Science Triangle was launched by [[Jim Wallace]], the [[Deputy First Minister of Scotland|Deputy First Minister]], in September 2004,&lt;ref name=Launch&gt;{{cite press release|title=Launch of Edinburgh Science Triangle|archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/3011/20130204024403/http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2004/09/30094733 |archivedate=4 February 2013|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2004/09/30094733|publisher=Scottish Government|date=30 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Roslin BioCentre]] in [[Midlothian]]. It is a member of Edinburgh's Local Investment Partnership, which includes the [[City of Edinburgh Council]], Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce, [[Scottish Development International]] and Scottish Enterprise. Scottish Development International promotes the Edinburgh Science Triangle abroad.

Funding to promote and support the Edinburgh Science Triangle comes from Scottish Enterprise, the [[European Regional Development Fund]], the City of Edinburgh, [[Midlothian Council|Midlothian]] and [[West Lothian Council|West Lothian]] councils, and the participating science parks.&lt;ref name=Launch /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1245">An '''[[Electromagnetism|Electromagnetic]] Log''', sometimes called an "EM Log", measures the speed of a vessel through water.

It operates on the principle that:
1 when a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] (such as water) passes through an electromagnetic field, a voltage is created and
2 the amount of voltage created increases as the speed of the conductor increases.

The process is
# the EM Log creates an [[electromagnetic field]].
# a voltage is induced in the water; the magnitude of the voltage varies depending upon the speed of the water flow past the sensor.
# the EM Log measures the voltage created and translates this into the vessel's speed through water.

== Advantages ==
* No moving parts
* Less affected by sea growth than [[Pit sword]]

== Disadvantages==
* Salinity and temperature of water affects calibration
* Measurements affected by boundary layer, (water speed slowed down close to the hull by friction)
* Provides boat/ship speed relative to water not ground.  Current affects accuracy.

The '''Federation Against Copyright Theft''' (informally '''FACT''') is the UK's leading [[trade association|trade organisation]] established to protect and represent the interests of its members' Intellectual Property (IP).

Established in 1983, FACT works closely with statutory law enforcement agencies to combat all forms of copyright infringement and members include global and UK film distributors, TV broadcasters and sport rights owners. Its sister-organisation the [[Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft|Australian Screen Association]] has a similar focus in the Oceania Region, taking over the responsibilities of the Australian Film and Video Security Office in the early 2000s.

==History==
In 2007 FACT reported seizing over 2.8m pirate DVDs and states it has "enhanced its enforcement capabilities against those involved in the manufacture, distribution and sale of copyright material both online and in hard copy format".{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Also in 2007, FACT, in collaboration with UK police, took down well known hot-linking site [[Tv-links.co.uk]]. FACT makes the claim that the 26-year-old man from Cheltenham was arrested in connection with offences relating to the facilitation of copyright infringement on the internet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 92 of the Trade Marks Act 1994 deals with falsely applying signs to goods that may be mistaken for a registered trademark.

In June 2009, FACT brought a lawsuit against the company Scopelight and its founders for running a video search engine called Surfthechannel.com. The organisation accompanied a police raid on the Scopelights owner's homes, Anton and Kelly Vickerman, who collaborated with the police in the initial investigation and they allowed FACT employee's to inspect confiscated computers and the information on them. After a few months the police decided there was not currently sufficient evidence to prosecute the owners for criminal charges. Scopelight's owners requested their property back to which FACT refused claiming they were holding onto the equipment to be used for a civil case against the owners. The issue was brought to court and it was ruled that FACT's actions were improper and the equipment should have been returned as soon as police decided not to prosecute the owners of Scopelight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Why Did UK Anti-Piracy Group FACT Get Computers From A Criminal Investigation... And Keep Them? | author = Mike Masnick | url = http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090706/1713445461.shtml | publisher = ''Techdirt'' | date = 7 July 2009 | accessdate = 7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a subsequent appeal (Scopelight &amp; Ors v Chief Constable of Northumbria Police &amp; Federation Against Copyright Theft [2009] EWCA Civ 1156) The Court of Appeal overturned that judgment and instead ruled that the police did indeed have such a power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Scopelight &amp; Ors v Chief Constable of Northumbria Police &amp; Federation Against Copyright Theft – Blackstone Chambers|url = http://www.blackstonechambers.com/news/cases/scopelight_ors.html|website = www.blackstonechambers.com|accessdate = 16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of this successful appeal, the evidence against the directors of Scopelight Limited (Anton and Kelly Vickerman) was heard in a criminal trial at Newcastle Crown Court in June and July 2012. Both defendants were charged under Conspiracy to Defraud (two counts each) and the jury trial took place in front of His Honour Judge Evans.

After a 7½-week trial, the jury found Kelly Vickerman not guilty on both counts and Anton Vickerman guilty on both counts of Conspiracy to Defraud.

On 14 August 2012 Anton Vickerman was sentenced to four years imprisonment on each charge of Conspiracy to Defraud, sentencing to run concurrently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|url = http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/anton-vickerman-sentencing-remarks-14082012.pdf|website = www.judiciary.gov.uk|accessdate = 16 May 2015|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130601062450/http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/anton-vickerman-sentencing-remarks-14082012.pdf|archivedate = 1 June 2013|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; FACT conducted an Intelligence gathering Operation against Vickerman and his family and associates to include an undercover operations.&lt;ref&gt;http://torrentfreak.com/movie-studios-compiled-scary-private-life-dossier-on-surfthechannel-admin-120815/&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, FACT pressured the [[Usenet]] file indexing site called NZBsRus to close after issuing cease-and-desist letters to the owner and several staff members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427105323/https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-06/28/fact-nzbsrus-shutdown | title=Anti-piracy group Fact forces closure of large Usenet filesharing index | publisher=Wired | accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-piracy warnings==
[[File:FACT-theora.ogg|thumb|right|250px|The 1995–1998 Columbia-Tristar version of "Beware of Illegal Video Cassettes"]]
[[File:Pvdl.ogg|thumb|right|250px|Pirate Videos: Daylight Robbery]]
FACT has produced several adverts which have appeared at the beginning of videos and DVDs released in the UK, as well as trailers shown before films in cinemas.

===1990s===
During the 1990s, FACT created a 30-second to 1 minute anti-piracy warning called "Beware of Illegal Video Cassettes", reminding customers to check whether they have a genuine video and how to report questionable copies. They appeared on many different video cassettes by various home video companies. Versions for each studio depicting their respective security label (generally a hologram of the studio logo) were created, with several iterations for each as the FACT hotline number changed multiple times throughout the decade. The warning was placed at the beginning of practically every rental released VHS tape in the UK (as well as many retail tapes), similar to the [[FBI|FBI Warning]] found on tapes in the United States. [[CIC Video]] had a similar term, except the hologram carried CIC logo copies, and it was used internationally and it was translated, although UK used it from 1988 to 1991. Since late 1996, this warning was followed by a [[public information film]] featuring a man attempting to return a pirate video purchased from a market after discovering that the sound was garbled and the picture unwatchable, ending with the tagline "Pirate Videos: Daylight Robbery." The "Pirate Videos: Daylight Robbery" ad was used until 2002. A precursor PIF, "Video Piracy: It's Not Worth It!" was released in 1995 that featured a young girl named Rebecca trying to watch a pirated VHS on a TV ending with a VHS player falling down with the words on top: "VIDEO PIRACY. It's not worth it.".

===2000s===
In 2002, FACT released a PIF called "The Pirates are Out to Get You". It featured a man destroying many items with an X-shaped branding iron, ending with the FACT logo and UK, Ireland, Australia &amp; New Zealand hotlines. The warning was placed at the beginning of practically every rental VHS tape in the UK (as well as the majority of retail tapes), similar to the FBI Warning found on tapes in the United States. 

With the advent of DVD, FACT borrowed the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]'s anti piracy spot "[[You Wouldn't Steal a Car]]", which concentrated more on [[copyright infringement]] through [[peer-to-peer filesharing]] and less on [[counterfeit]] copies. The spot related the [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] of movies to stealing a handbag, a car, and other such items (similar to the US FAST "[[Piracy is theft]]" slogan of the 1990s).

The advert has been criticised by the general public and TV personalities alike: the most common complaint being that the advert only appears on genuinely purchased DVDs and cannot be skipped by fast forwarding or pressing the DVD menu button.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weeklygripe.co.uk/a565.asp |title=Unable to skip anti-piracy adverts on DVD |accessdate=29 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent spots have included [[Knock-off Nigel]], where a man is ridiculed by his friends and colleagues for buying counterfeit DVDs and downloading films from [[BitTorrent (protocol)|Bit Torrent]] along with ads that say "Thank You" to the British public for supporting the film industry by either buying a ticket and seeing a film in the cinema or purchasing a genuine DVD/Blu-ray.
&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Internet Studies William H. Dutton - 2013 - Page 1783 0191641189
 
However, when called to account by the UK Advertising Standards Authority over the claim that “piracy funds terrorism,” FACT, after initial resistance to revealing its sources on the grounds that this might undermine ongoing security investigations, admitted that the only confirmed instance of such a link was that of a Northern Irish paramilitary group, who, after the 1998 Good Friday Peace Agreement had become involved in the commercial counterfeiting of DVDs. A threat to blow up the ...&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
Flip cameras can record videos at different resolutions. FlipHD camcorders [[digital recording|digitally record]] [[high-definition video]] at 1280 x 720 resolution using [[H.264]] [[video compression]], [[Advanced Audio Coding]] (AAC) [[audio compression (data)|audio compression]] and the [[MP4]] file format, while the older models used a 640 x 480 resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theflip.com/products_flip_video_specs.II.shtml |title=Flip Video - See the Specs |website=TheFlip.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516221340/http://theflip.com/products_flip_video_specs.II.shtml |archivedate=May 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MinoHD and SlideHD models had an internal [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion rechargeable battery]] included, while the Ultra series included a removable battery that could be interchanged with standard AA or AAA batteries.

All models lacked memory card extension slots, though the Flip UltraHD(2 hr) could record to a storage device via FlipPort. Models could be connected to a computer with a flip-out [[USB]] connector, without the need for a USB cable. Flip Cameras recorded [[monaural]] sound, and used a simple clip-navigation interface with a [[D-pad]] and two control buttons which allowed for viewing of recorded videos, starting and stopping recording, and [[digital zoom]]. The third and final generation of Flip UltraHD cameras retailed for $149.99 and $199.99 for 4GB (1 hour) and 8GB (2 hour) models respectively, incorporated digital stabilization, and increased the frame rate from 30 to 60 frames per second. With FlipPort, users can plug in external accessories.

All Flip cameras included the required video player and [[3ivx]] codec software, '''FlipShare''', on the camera's internal storage. For all models after 2010, an [[HDMI]] cable could stream videos to TV screens.

Later Flip Video models came in a variety of colors, and could be custom ordered with designs digitally painted on. Accessories for the Flip Video camera included an underwater case, a mini-[[tripod]], a [[bicycle helmet]] attachment, and a wool case (Mino camcorders) or soft pouch (Flip UltraHD), rechargeable battery replacements for the UltraHD series, and an extension cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www6.nohold.net/CiscoFlip/ukp.aspx?pid=2&amp;vw=1&amp;articleid=534 |title=Flip Video |author=|date=|website=Nohold.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flip Video's accompanying software was called '''FlipShare''', which facilitated downloads of videos, basic editing, and uploading to various websites. After the release of version 5.6, '''FlipShare''' no longer included a function to convert video to [[WMV]] format. While this has been acknowledged by Cisco as a defect, a fix has yet to be announced.

== History ==

The third and final Flip MinoHD was released on September 20, 2010. It featured HD recording capabilities in the same dimensions as the second generation MinoHD (1280/720 at 30 fps), The only major change in the MinoHD third generation was Image Stabilization. Also released on September 20, 2010 was a 4 GB, MinoHD with one hour of recording capability. The one-hour version retailed for $179 and the two-hour version retailed for $229.

Free Minos were made available to all audience members at [[YouTube Live]] due to Flip Video's sponsorship of the event. A station was even set up so people could upload the videos to [[YouTube]].

=== FlipShare TV ===
[[File:FlipShareTV logo.png|right]]
FlipShare TV was an accessory for the third generation Flip UltraHD camera, and allowed users to connect the TV base to their TV, plug in a USB transmitter key to their computer and view their Flipshare library.

=== Acquisition and shutdown by Cisco ===
On May 21, 2009, [[Cisco Systems]] acquired Pure Digital Technologies for [[United States dollar|US$]] 590 million in stock.

On April 12, 2011, Cisco announced that it "will exit aspects of its consumer business" which includes shutting down the Flip Video division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&amp;articleId=775104 |title=Press Release - The Network |author=|date=|website=Cisco.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some observers suggested that the Flip was facing growing competition from [[camera phone]]s, particularly [[smartphones]] (which disrupted consumer electronics trade such as point-and-shoot cameras, wristwatches, alarm clocks, portable music players and GPS devices) that had recently begun incorporating HD video cameras.

Contrary to popular perception, smartphones made up only a small fraction of overall worldwide sales of cell phones in 2011, and the Flip was still selling strongly when its discontinuation was announced.&lt;ref name="NYTdpogue"&gt;{{cite news |last=David |first=Pogue |title=The Tragic Death of the Flip |url=http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/14/the-tragic-death-of-the-flip/ |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=August 27, 2011 |date=April 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other potential causes of the shutdown include the fact that consumer hardware was not part of Cisco's core businesses of services and software, and that their profit margins on consumer electronics at the time were narrow.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;

As Cisco shut down the Flip business instead of divesting of it, it has been suggested that the patents and other intellectual property from the acquisition could prove valuable to Cisco's [[videoconferencing]] business in the future.&lt;ref name="NYTdpogue"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30686_3-20053337-266.html |title=Why Cisco killed the Flip mini camcorder |first=Marguerite |last=Reardon |date=April 13, 2011 |publisher=CBS Interactive |work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flexowriter.JPG|thumb|Model 1 SPD (Systems Programatic Double-case) equipped for edge-punched cards; most Flexowriters had paper-tape readers and punches]]

The '''Friden Flexowriter''' was a [[teleprinter]], a heavy-duty electric typewriter capable of being driven not only by a human typing, but also automatically by several methods, including direct attachment to a computer and by use of [[paper tape]].

Elements of the design date to the 1920s, and variants of the machine were produced until the early 1970s; the machines found a variety of uses during the evolution of office equipment in the 20th century, including being among the first electric typewriters, computer input and output devices, forerunners of modern word processing, and also having roles in the machine tool and printing industries.

==History==

===Origins and early history===
The Flexowriter can trace its roots to some of the earliest [[electric typewriter]]s.  In 1925, the [[Remington Typewriter Company]] wanted to expand their offerings to include electric typewriters. Having little expertise or manufacturing ability with electrical appliances, they partnered with [[Northeast Electric Company]] of Rochester and made a production run of 2500 electric typewriters. When the time came to make more units, Remington was suffering a management vacuum and could not complete contract negotiations, so Northeast began work on their own electric typewriter. In 1929, they started selling the '''Electromatic'''.

In 1931, Northeast was bought by [[Delco Electronics|Delco]]. Delco had no interest in a typewriter product line, so they spun the product off as a separate company called Electromatic. Around this time, Electromatic built a prototype automatic typewriter. This device used a wide roll of paper, similar to a [[player piano]] roll. For each key on the typewriter, there was a column on the roll of paper. If the key was to be pressed, then a hole was punched in the column for that key.

The Electromatic typewriter patents document the use of pivoted spiral [[cam]]s operating against a hard rubber drive roller to drive the print mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Russell G. Thompson, Power Mechanism, {{US patent|1777055}}, granted Sept. 30, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the foundation of essentially all later electric typewriters.  The typewriter could be equipped with a "remote control" mechanism allowing one typewriter to control another or to record and play back typed data through a [[Parallel communication|parallel data connection]] with one wire per typewriter key.&lt;ref&gt;Russell G. Thompson, Apparatus for remote control, {{US patent|1996013}}, granted March 26, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Electromatic tape perforator used a wide tape, with punch position per key on the keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;Chester W. Cumrine, Perforating Machine, {{US patent|1873554}}, granted Sept. 11, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, a code for the [[paper tape]] used to drive [[Linotype machine|Linotype]] and other [[typesetting]] machines was [[standardized]]. This allowed use of a tape only five to seven holes wide to drive automatic typewriters, teleprinters and similar equipment.

In 1933, [[International Business Machines|IBM]] wanted to enter the electric typewriter market, and purchased the Electromatic Corporation, renaming the typewriter the '''[[IBM Electromatic typewriter|IBM Model 01]]''', and continuing to use the Electromatic trademark.&lt;ref&gt;IBM Electromatic Typewriter, National Museum of American History, [http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1064590 Catalog Number 1987.0544.01]&lt;/ref&gt;

IBM experimented with several accessories and enhancements for its electric typewriter.  In 1942, IBM filed a patent application for a typewriter that could print justified and proportionally spaced text.  This required recording each line of text on a paper tape before it was printed.&lt;ref&gt;Waldemar A. Ayres, Printing Machine, {{US patent|2390413}}, granted Dec. 4, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;  IBM experimented with a 12-hole paper tape compatible with their [[Punched card|punched-card code]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert W. Mills, F.J. Furman, E.J. Rabenda, Punching Apparatus, {{US patent|2377801}}, granted Dec, 23, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;
Eventually, IBM settled on a 6-hole encoding, as documented in their automatic justifying typewriter patents filed in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald D. Dodge, Automatic Justifying Typewriter, {{US patent|2555734}}, granted Dec. 21, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald D. Dodge, Typewriter Punch, {{US patent|2540027}}, granted Dec. 21, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;  Equipping an electric typewriter with both a paper-tape reader and punch created the basic foundation for what would become the Flexowriter.

By the late 1930s, IBM had a nearly complete [[monopoly]] on [[unit record equipment]] and related [[punched card]] machinery, and expanding the product line into automatic typewriters equipped with paper tape raised [[antitrust]] issues. As a result, IBM sold the product line and factory to the Commercial Controls Corporation (CCC) of [[Rochester, New York]], which also absorbed the National Postal Meter Corporation. CCC was formed by several former IBM employees.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

===World War II===
Around the time of [[World War II]], CCC developed a [[proportional spacing]] model of the Flexowriter known as '''The Presidential''' (or sometimes the '''President'''). The model name was derived from the fact that these units were used to generate the [[White House]] letters informing families of the deaths of service personnel in the war. CCC also manufactured other complex mechanical devices for the war effort, including [[M1 carbine]]s.

In 1944, the pioneering [[Harvard Mark I]] computer was constructed, using an Electromatic for output.

===Postwar===

In 1950, Edwin O. Blodgett filed a patent on behalf of Commercial Controls Corporation for a "tape controlled typewriter."  This machine used a 6-level [[Punched tape|punched paper tape]], and was the basis for the machines CCC and Friden built over the next 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;E. O. Blodgett, Tape Controlled Typewriter, {{US patent|2700446}}, Granted Jan. 25, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;  This improved machine was contemporaneous with the first generation of commercial computers.  Applications for Flexowriters exploded in the 1950s, covering territory in commercial printing, machine tools, computers, and many forms of office automation. This versatility was helped by Friden's willingness to engineer and build many different configurations. In the late 1950s, CCC was purchased by [[Friden, Inc.|Friden]], a maker of electromechanical calculators, and it was under their name that the machines achieved their greatest diversity and success; applications are further detailed below.

Two tape stations allowed implementation of what was then called the [[form letter]], the combination of standard text (one tape) with varying name and address information (the other tape).

===End of product line===

Edward (Edwin?) Blodgett, Chief Engineer of Friden R&amp;D was replaced in 1964 while ill. It's unclear what effect this had on development, especially as Blodgett was apparently biased against electronics, favoring electromechnical solutions to design problems.

Friden was acquired by the [[Singer Corporation]] in 1965. Singer had little or no understanding of the computer industry, and there was a clash of corporate culture with Friden employees.

[[File:Flexowriter 2201 Programatic.jpg|thumb|The Model 2201 Programatic]]
There was a major redesign of the Flexowriter in the mid 1960s.  The Model 2201 Programatic, introduced in 1965, had a sleek modern styling and 13 programmable [[function key]]s.&lt;ref&gt;The completely new 2201 FLEXOWRITER automatic writing machine by Friden (advertisement), [https://archive.org/stream/Nations-Business-1965-02#page/n74/mode/1up Nation's Business], Vol. 53, No. 2 (February 1965), pages 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first major change in appearance of Flexowriters in nearly forty years.  Programming was done using a 320-contact [[plugboard]], and all of the logic was implemented using [[relay]]s.  The case, although modern looking, was entirely metal, giving the machine a shipping weight of 132 pounds (60&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/flexo/tour.shtml The Friden Flexowriter, a Guided Tour], June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  The selling price was £2900 (British pounds).&lt;ref&gt;Section 5 -- Peripheral Equipment, [https://books.google.com/books?id=REWeBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=SA5-PA10 Flexowriter -- Friden 2201], British Commercial Computer Digest, 10th Ed., Pergamon, 1969; page 5/11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although primarily sold as a stand-alone [[word processor]] (a term not yet in use at the time), Friden also sold it with a communications option allowing it to be used as a computer terminal.&lt;ref&gt;Friden announces on-line capability for the world's most versatile automatic writing machine (adversisement), [https://archive.org/stream/Nations-Business-1965-11#page/n21/mode/1up Nation's Business], Vol. 53, No. 11 (November 1965), page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the 2200 family operated at 135 [[words per minute]] (11.3 characters per second).  The family also included the 2210 and 2211, on which the function keys were replaced with a [[numeric keypad]], and the 2261, using [[ASCII]] instead of the proprietary 8-bit code used by other members of the 2200 family.&lt;ref name="BankingAutomation"&gt;G. W. A. Dummer, F. P. Thompson, J. M. Robertson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_4ajBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA469 Friden Flexowriter Data], Banking Automation Vol. 1, pages 469-481, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2300 series were cosmetically similar to the 2200 series, although without the function keys or numeric keypad, with a simplified plugboard, and operating at 145 words per minute (12 characters per second).&lt;ref name="BankingAutomation" /&gt;  In addition to the basic 2301, the 2302 supported the auxiliary tape readers and punches from the 2200 family.  The 2304 offered [[Typeface#Proportion|proportional]] spacing and a carbon ribbon mechanism, making it suitable for preparing [[camera-ready]] copy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/bitsavers_fridenArmyterManualJun67_34162899/Army_18-510-21_2300_Flexowriter_Manual_Jun67#page/n0/mode/1up 2300 Flexowriter Automatic Writing Machine Series], Department of the Army Pamphlet 18-510-21, June 1967; the colophon says "Reprinted by permission of Friden, Incorporated".&lt;/ref&gt;  The base price for the 2300 family was £1400 (British pounds).&lt;ref&gt;Section 5 -- Peripheral Equipment, [https://books.google.com/books?id=REWeBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=SA5-PA11 Flexowriter -- Friden 2300 Series], British Commercial Computer Digest, 10th Ed., Pergamon, 1969; page 5/11.&lt;/ref&gt;  This would be the last hurrah for the line, with production halting in the early 1970s.

Sales and innovation declined.  In the late 1960s, the market for word processing equipment was shifting to magnetic media.  IBM introduced the [[IBM MT/ST|Magnetic Tape Selectric Typewriter]] (MT/ST) in 1964.  In October, 1968, [[Information Control Systems]] introduced the Astrotype word processing system.  Both of these used magnetic tape and [[Selectric]] print mechanisms.  With its fixed type font and paper-tape recording medium, the Flexowriter had difficulty competing with these machines, although some Flexowriter documentation emphasized the fact that, unlike IBM's MT/ST tapes, Flexowriter users could cut and splice paper tapes, particularly if they could recognize some of the common codes such as carriage return.&lt;ref name="BankingAutomation" /&gt;  The Diablo [[Daisy wheel printing|daisy wheel printer]], introduced in 1969, offered comparable print quality at twice the speed.  Larger manufacturers such as IBM and DEC made their own console equipment, and [[video terminal]]s began to appear, displacing paper-based systems.  Eventually, even the CNC machine tool industry abandoned paper tape, although this was significantly slower because of the long working life of machine tools.

==Applications==

===Automatic typewriters===
[[Image:Flexowriter auxiliary reader.jpg|thumb|Friden auxiliary paper-tape reader for six-level [[Punched tape|paper tape]]]]
From its earliest days through to at least the mid-1960s, Flexowriters were used as automatic letter writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Kane |first=Lawrence  |title=Computer a Help to 'Friendly Doc'; Automated Letter Writer Can Dispense a Cheery Word |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 22, 1966 |page=348 |quote=Automated cordiality will be one of the services offered to physicians and dentists who take space in a new medical center.... The typist will insert the homey touch in the appropriate place as the Friden automated, programmed "Flexowriter" rattles off the form letters requesting payment... or informing that the X-ray's of the patient (kidney) (arm) (stomach) (chest) came out negative. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1966/05/22/archives/computer-a-help-to-friendly-doc-automatic-letter-writer-can.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the US White House was using them during the Second World War, in the 1960s, [[United States]] [[Congressperson|Members of Congress]] used Flexowriters extensively to handle enormous volumes of routine correspondence with constituents; an advantage of this method was that these letters appeared to have been individually typed by hand. These were complemented by [[autopen]] machines which could use a pen to place a signature on letters making them appear to have been hand-signed.

Auxiliary paper-tape readers could be attached to a Flexowriter to create an early form of "[[mail merge]]", where a long custom-created tape containing individual addresses and salutations was merged with a closed-loop form-letter and printed on continuous-form letterhead; both tapes contained embedded "[[control character]]s" to switch between readers.

===Console terminals===
As the unit record equipment (tabulating machine) industry matured and became the computer industry, Flexowriters were commonly used as console terminals for computers. Because [[ASCII]] had not yet been standardized, each type of computer tended to use its own system for encoding characters; Flexowriters were capable of being configured with numerous encodings particular to the computer the machine was being used with.

Computers that used Flexowriters as consoles include:
* The Electromatic on the [[Harvard Mark I]]
* The [[MIT]] [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind I]] computer, first designed to control a flight simulator, and later becoming the basis of the [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] network.
* The Lincoln Laboratory [[TX-0]], an early experimental transistor-based minicomputer, which was to be a seminal influence on [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] culture at MIT in the late 1950s prior to the introduction of the [[PDP-1]].
* The [[BMEWS]] DIP computer, [[NORAD]] Combat Operations Center (COC), Colorado Springs, Colo., beginning in 1960. Tape code was essentially base-32.
*[[Burroughs 205|Electrodata 205]]. [[ElectroData Corporation|ElectroData]] was purchased by the [[Burroughs Corporation]], and many later Burroughs machines also used Flexowriters
* The [[Librascope LGP-30]] and LGP-21
* The Packard Bell PB 250
* The SEA CAB 500
* The [[ALWAC III-E]]
* The [[English Electric]] [[KDF9]].

===Offline punch and printer===
Flexowriters could also be used as [[key punch|offline punches]] and printers. Programmers would type their programs on Flexowriters, which would punch the program onto paper tape. The tapes could then be loaded into computers to run the programs. Computers could then use their own punches to make paper tapes that could be used by the Flexowriters to print output. Among the computers which commonly used Flexowriters for this task was the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-1]].

===Machine tools===
The ability to support diverse encodings meant that adapting Flexowriters to generate the paper tapes used to drive [[CNC]] machine tool equipment was a relatively simple affair, and many Flexowriters found homes in [[machine shop]]s into the 1970s, when magnetic media displaced paper tape in the industry.

===Unit record and early computing===
Friden manufactured equipment which could connect their calculators to Flexowriters, printing output and performing unit record tasks such as form letters for bills, and eventually manufactured their own computers to further enhance these capabilities. These variants were sold as the '''Friden Computyper'''. Computypers were electromechanical; they had no electronics, at least in their earlier models. The calculator mechanism, inside a desk-like enclosure, was much like a Friden model STW desktop calculator, except that it had electrical input (via solenoids) and output (low-torque rotary switches on the dial shafts) .

===Commercial printing===
[[Image:Flexowriter edge punched card.JPG|thumb|As well as paper tape, the same codes/holes might be punched on cards that
were easy to file (this example has a pretty pattern of holes for demonstration purposes that is not actually meaningful if read by a Flexowriter)]]
A product known as the '''Justowriter''' (or '''Just-O-Writer''') was developed for the printing industry. It allowed typists to produce [[Justification (typesetting)|justified text]] for use in typesetting. This worked by having the user type the document on a Recording unit, which placed extra codes for spacing on the paper tape. The tape was placed into a second specially adapted Flexowriter which had two paper tape reading heads; one would read the text while the other controlled the spacing of the print. Spacing codes were stored in relays inside the machine as a line of text progressed. At least some Justowriters used carbon (as opposed to ink-impregnated fabric) ribbons to produce cleaner type, suitable for mass photo-set reproduction, sometimes referred to as cold type composition.

The '''Line Casting Control''' or '''LCC''' product generated paper tapes for Linotype and [[Intertype Corporation|Intertype]] automatic typesetters. In addition to punching a tape containing the text to be typeset, it turned on a lamp easily seen by the operator to show that the text on the line being typed could be typeset—it was within justifiable range. The LCC had a four-wheel rotary escapement, and a set of gears between the carriage rack and the escapement, to permit the smallest unit of spacing at the escapement to be quite small at the carriage. The spring-tensioned tape that moved the carriage had far more tension (possibly 20&amp;nbsp;lbs?) than did a standard Flexowriter.

[[American Type Founders]] produced a [[phototypesetter]] based on the Justowriter/Flexowriter platform.

===Finance===
There was an "accounting" model with an ultra-wide carriage and two-color ribbon for printing out wide financial reports. The Friden accounting model was called "5010 COMPUTYPER" and was capable of arithmetic functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication &amp; division) at electronic speeds and to print the results automatically in a useful document.

==Hardware==
[[Image:Flexowriter power roll.JPG|thumb|The power roll is the large rubber roller that continually rotates. Two rows of cams, one above and the other below, surround and engage on it. This is a bottom view.]]
[[Image:Flexowriter cam.JPG|thumb|Close-up of an almost-typical cam that catches on the power roll when a key is pressed down.]]
As a cutting edge device of their time, Flexowriters, especially some of the specialized types like typesetters, were quite costly. They were made for extreme durability. There were porous bronze bearings, many hardened steel parts, very strong springs, and a substantial AC motor to move all the parts. Most parts are made of heavy gauge steel. The housing and most removable covers were die castings. While the final Singer models did make some use of plastics, even they are quite heavy compared to other electric typewriters of their time.  As a result, the platen carriage is very heavy, and when the "Carriage return" key is pressed, the carriage moves with about 20 pounds of force and enough momentum to injure a careless operator. If used only as manual typewriters, and properly maintained, Flexowriters might last a century. When reproducing form letters from punched tape, the considerable speed and loud sound of the device made watching it a somewhat frightening experience. 

Towards the bottom of the unit there is a large rubber roller ("power roll") that rotates continuously at a few hundred rpm. It provides power for typing as well as power-operated backspace, type basket shift, and power for engaging (and probably disengaging) the carriage return clutch.

Referring to the photo of the cam assembly (often simply called a cam; it was not meant to be disassembled), the holes in the side plates at the lower left are for the assembly's pivot rod, which is fixed to the frame. At the extreme upper left is part of a disconnectable pivot that pulls down on the typing linkage. When installed, down is to the right in the photo, so to speak.

Referring again to the part at the upper left, the mating part has a threaded mounting for adjusting cam clearance from the power roll. The irregular "roundish" part, lower right center, is the cam, itself. It rotates in the frame while in contact with the power roll. The surface of the cam in contact with the power roll had grooves for better grip. As the radius at the contact patch increases, the frame rotates clockwise to pull down on the linkage to type the character.

This particular cam assembly has a cam that rotates a full turn for each operation; it might operate the backspace, basket shift, or carriage-return clutch disengage mechanism. Cams for typing characters rotated only half a turn, the halves of course being identical.

Below the cam in this photo (hidden) is a spring-loaded lever that pushes against a pin on the cam. On the upper edge of the cam, as shown, is a little projection that engages the release lever, which is at the lowest part of  the image; it's an irregular shape.

When a key is pressed down, it moves the release lever and unlatches the cam for that letter; the spring-loaded lever pressing on the pin rotates the cam until it engages the power roll. As the cam continues to turn, increasing radius rotates the cam's frame slightly (clockwise in the photo) to operate the typing linkage for that character.

As the cam continues to rotate, the spring-loaded lever pushes on the pin to move it toward home position, but if the key is still down, the cam (now out of contact with the power roll) stalls because the projection on the cam catches on another part of the release lever. The cam stalls until the key is released. When released, the lever catches the projection so the cam is now in home position. This is like a simple clock escapement, and prevents repeated typing. (The "key-down" anti-repeat stop can be removed, so that fast repetitive typing can be done, but this change is difficult to undo.)

Carriage return was done by a non-stretch very durable textile tape attached to the platen advance mechanism at the left of the carriage. For a return, the tape wound up on a small reel operated from the drive system through a clutch.
A cam engaged the clutch; it was disengaged by the left margin stop, perhaps directly, perhaps via another cam. (Info. needed here!) A light-torque spring kept the return tape wound on the reel.
[[Image:Flexowriter relay.JPG|thumb|left|Close-up of one of the relays that controls the electrical operations]]
The basic mechanism looks just like an IBM electric typewriter from the late 1940s. In fact, some Flexowriter parts are identical in fit and function to the early IBM electric typewriters (those with rotary carriage escapements, a gear-driven power roll, and a governor-controlled variable speed "universal" (wound-rotor/commutator) motor.)

The early IBM rotary-escapement proportional-spacing typewriters (three wheel rotary escapement, spur gear differentials) had code bars to control the amount of carriage movement for the current character. They were operated by the cams. However, the Flexowriter's mechanical encoder was a very different and far more rugged design, although still operated by the cams.
[[Image:Flexowriter connectors.JPG|thumb|Close-up of the two large 50-pin connectors on the right side of a typical machine, to the rear (right of photo) is the JL1 input socket. In front of this (left of photo) is JL2 output connector with its mating Cannon plug, ready to be attached to a cable, in place]]

Flexowriters (at least those prior to 1969) do not have [[transistor]]s; electrical control operations were done with telephone-style (E-Class) [[relay]]s, and troubleshooting often involved problems with the timing on the relays. Another reader has also found that the timing settings of the various leaf switches (such as in the tape reader) are also important.

The screws used in the Flexowriter were unique, having large flat heads with a very narrow screwdriver slot and a unique thread size and pitch. This may have been a [[Connector conspiracy|conscious decision]]. Another reader found that standard 4-40UNC threads appear to fit some of the cover-attachments; internally, the headless set-screws require fluted Bristol keys, which are not commonly available in Great Britain.

There is a holder for a large roll of paper tape on the back of the unit, with tape feeding around to a punch on the left side, toward the rear. The tape reader is on the same side, toward the front, and is essentially identical to the reader shown on the front of the square housing in the photo of the auxiliary reader. The right side of a Flexowriter has a large (~1") connector for hooking the unit up to computers and other equipment. Depending on the model, this connector may be wired in many different ways.

At various times and in various configurations, flexos came with 5, 6, 7 or 8 channel paper tape reader/punches, could have several auxiliary paper tape units attached, and could also attach to IBM punched card equipment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6321">'''Galileo''' is a [[computer reservations system]] (CRS) owned by [[Travelport]]. As of 2000 it had a 26.4% share of worldwide CRS airline bookings.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Transportation]]: [http://www.dot.gov/affairs/Computer%20Reservations%20System.htm Computer Reservations System (CRS)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527000044/http://www.dot.gov/affairs/Computer%20Reservations%20System.htm |date=2008-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to airline reservations, the Galileo CRS is also used to book [[train]] travel, [[cruise ship|cruise]]s, [[car]] rental, and [[hotel]] rooms.

The Galileo system was moved from Denver, Colorado, to the [[Worldspan]] datacenter in Atlanta, Georgia, on September 28, 2008, following the 2007 merger of Travelport and Worldspan (although they now share the same datacenter, they continue to be run as separate systems). 

Galileo is subject to the [[Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System II|Capps II]] and its successor [[Secure Flight]] program for the selection of passengers with a risk profile.

Galileo is a member of the [[International Air Transport Association]], of the [[OpenTravel Alliance]] and of [[SITA (IT company)|SITA]].

==History==
Galileo traces its roots back to 1971 when [[United Airlines]] created its first computerized central reservation system under the name Apollo. During the 1980s and early 1990s, a significant proportion of airline tickets were sold by travel agents.  Flights by the airline owning the reservation system had preferential display on the computer screen.  Due to the high market penetration of the Sabre and Apollo systems, owned by American Airlines and United Airlines, respectively, Worldspan and Galileo were created by other airline groups in an attempt to gain market share in the computer reservation system market and, by inference, the commercial airline market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5D81E38F933A25754C0A961948260 | work=The New York Times | title=United Air In Venture In Europe | first=Agis | last=Salpukas | date=July 10, 1987 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Galileo was formed in 1987 by nine European carriers -- [[British Airways]], [[KLM Royal Dutch Airlines]], [[Alitalia]], [[Swissair]], [[Austrian Airlines]], [[Olympic Airlines|Olympic]], [[Sabena]], [[Air Portugal]] and [[Aer Lingus]].&lt;ref name="baltimoresun1992"&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-03-04/business/1992064009_1_american-airlines-apollo-carriers Two top airline reservations systems to be merged - Baltimore Sun]. Articles.baltimoresun.com (1992-03-04). Retrieved on 2013-08-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response and to prevent possible government intervention, United Airlines spun off its Apollo reservation system, which was then controlled by Covia.  Galileo International was born when Covia acquired Europe's Galileo and merged it with the Apollo system in 1992.&lt;ref name="baltimoresun1992"/&gt;

The Apollo reservation system was used by United Airlines until March 3, 2012, when it switched to SHARES, a system used by its former Continental Airlines subsidiary. Apollo is still used by Galileo International (now part of [[Travelport]] GDS) travel agency customers in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and [[Japan]].

Galileo UK{{Clarifyme|What is Galileo UK?|date=October 2013}} was originally created from [[Travicom]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IbTT1yIfsYIC&amp;pg=PA339&amp;lpg=PA339&amp;dq=travicom+galileo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5_wk3mA2Fw&amp;sig=C6mHjBtvkosKXTLk64ZBXTxqPaQ Dictionary of Travel and Tourism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Books.Google.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cards.org/ Travicom and Galileo User Group&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GCmHf1FDZlQC&amp;pg=PT128&amp;lpg=PT128&amp;dq=travicom+galileo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6f7wmUFjg2&amp;sig=aQ8rcmVCBBXtSdxznOzMFVmuzvY Leisure Marketing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Books.Google.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1987/1987%20-%201976.html Flight Global&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Flithglobal.com&lt;/ref&gt;  which was the world's first multi-access reservations system using the technology developed by [[Videcom international|Videcom]].

A '''heated roll laminator''' uses heated rollers to melt [[Adhesive|glue]] extruded onto [[Laminate|lamination]] film. This film is in turn applied to a [[Substrate (printing)|substrate]] such as [[paper]] or [[Card stock|card]] using pressure rollers. The primary purpose of laminating with such a machine is to embellish or protect [[Printing|printed]] documents or images. Heated roll laminators can vary in size from [[office]] based [[pouch laminator]]s to industrial sized machines. Such industrial machines are primarily used for high quantity/quality output by printers or print finishers.

Whether small office or industrial machines their primary function is to embellish or protect printed works. Such laminators are used to apply varying thicknesses of lamination film onto substrates such as [[paper]] or [[fabric]]s. The main advantage to the use of heated roll laminators is that of speed. Heated laminators use heated rollers or heated shoes to melt the glue which is applied to lamination film. The process of heating the glue prior to applying the film to a substrate allows for a faster application of the film. The laminates and adhesives used are generally cheaper to manufacture than cold roll laminates, often as much as half the cost depending on the comparison made. As the materials are non-adhesive until exposed to heat, they are much easier to handle. The glue is solid at room temperature, so lamination of this type is less likely to shift or warp after its application than pressure activated laminates, which rely on a highly viscous, adhesive fluid.

==Film==
[[File:Heated Roll Lamination Machine.webm|thumb|Woman laminating signs and small cards using heated roll lamination machine.]]
Roll laminators typically use two rolls to complete the lamination process, with one roll being on top and the other roll on the bottom. These rolls slide onto metal bars, known as mandrels, which are then placed in the machine and feed through it. In the United States, the most common core size found on lamination film is one inch (25- to 27-inch-wide film). Larger format laminators use a larger core, often 2{{fraction|1|4}} to 3 inches in diameter. Film is usually available in 1.5, 3, 5, 7, and 10 mil thicknesses. The higher the number, the thicker the film. A mil is one thousandth of an inch (.001").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.officezone.com/laminator-resources.htm | title = Lamination Resources Guide | accessdate = 2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Printers or print finishers often use industrial heated roll laminators to laminate such things as [[paperback]] [[book]] [[Book cover|covers]], [[magazine]] covers, [[poster]]s, cards and [[postcard]]s, in-shop displays as well as other applications.

'''Hinjawadi''' is a suburb located in [[Pune]], Maharashtra, India. It is off the [[Dehu Road–Katraj bypass]] on the western side of [[Wakad]] in Pune. It is mainly known for the ''Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park'' (which also extends to adjacent [[Maan, Pune|Maan]] and [[Marunji]]). The 2800-acre IT park in Hinjawadi, Maan and Marunji, houses hundreds of companies of different sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/pune-where-panic-reins-an-it-campus/article18591285.ece|title=Pune, where panic reigns an IT campus|first=Shoumojit|last=Banerjee|date=27 May 2017|newspaper=The Hindu|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Hinjawadi was a village until the construction of the Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park. The park comprises three phases with further phases planned. Hinjawadi Industries Association (HIA) was laid out to provide a joint forum to all stakeholders based out of Hinjawadi and nearby places.

Hinjawadi is a proposed hub for integrated townships in Pune.&lt;ref name="moneycontrol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/real-estate/integrated-townshipspune_865368.html|title=Integrated townships in Pune&amp;nbsp;— Moneycontrol.com|publisher=moneycontrol.com|accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new ''Special Township Policy Act'' of the Maharashtra government has laid down an integrated approach to development of townships to de-congest [[Pune Municipal Corporation]] areas and encourage new settlements in its periphery though higher FSI (floor space index) than what is normally allowed in the municipal limits.

== Transport ==

===Road transport===
Due to rapid development, Hinjawadi is facing serious traffic problems during peak hours. From 8.00&amp;nbsp;AM to 12:00&amp;nbsp;PM and 5.30 PM to 7.30 PM, HMVs (Heavy Motor Vehicles) are not allowed to enter the area due to high congestion on the roads and the number of vehicles are increasing due to a lot of career opportunities. Above 2.5 Lacs employees travel daily to and from the IT park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/commuters-heave-a-sigh-of-relief-after-one-way-traffic-eases-congestion-in-hinjewadi/story-7rGoia9jvtAzTfR6Ssvy7M.html|title=Commuters heave a sigh of relief after one-way traffic eases congestion in Hinjewadi|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the traffic cops have designated several approach points as one-way to ease the traffic congestion which has helped to a certain extent. 

===Metro===
Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.punemetropolitanregionaldevelo.elisting.in/|title=Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority - PMRDA {{!}} Government Organization {{!}} India {{!}} eListing.in|work=eListing.in|access-date=2017-10-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested a metro route between Hinjawadi and [[Shivajinagar, Pune|Shivajinagar]].&lt;ref&gt;http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/pmrda-proposes-metro-line-from-shivajinagar-to-hinjewadi/&lt;/ref&gt;
The line will travel through [[Pune Municipal Corporation|PMC]], [[Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation|PCMC]] and [[Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation|MIDC]] areas.

==Security==
The [[Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation]] (MIDC) took special initiative to install [[Closed-circuit television camera|closed circuit television camera]] project. The project, co-sponsored by the MIDC and the HIA, has 22 [[Closed-circuit television|surveillance cameras]] monitoring the activity at six road junctions in the IT Park. It is integrated with the Rs 225-crore CCTV camera project (1,285 cameras at 441 junctions) coming up in the city. The output is monitored and recorded by the centralized unit at the Pune Police Commissionerate.

[[File:Ur_chariot.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[wheel]], invented sometime before the 4th millennium BC, is one of the most ubiquitous and important technologies. This detail of the "Standard of Ur", c. 2500 BC., displays a Sumerian [[chariot]]]]

The '''history of technology''' is the history of the [[invention]] of [[tool]]s and techniques and is one of the categories of the [[Human history|history of humanity]]. Technology can refer to methods ranging from as simple as [[stone tools]] to the complex [[genetic engineering]] and [[information technology]] that has emerged since the 1980s. The term technology comes from the Greek word techne, meaning art and craft, and the word logos, meaning word and speech. It was first used to describe applied arts, but it is now used to described advancements and changes which affect the environment around us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/history-of-technology|title=history of technology – Summary &amp; Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New knowledge has enabled people to create new things, and conversely, many scientific endeavors are made possible by [[technologies]] which assist humans in [[travel|traveling]] to places they could not previously reach, and by [[scientific instrument]]s by which we study nature in more detail than our natural senses allow.

Since much of technology is [[applied science]], technical history is connected to the [[history of science]]. Since technology uses [[resource]]s, technical history is tightly connected to [[economic history]]. From those [[Resource (Windows)|resources]], technology produces other resources, including ''technological artifacts'' used in [[everyday life]].

[[Technological change]] affects and is affected by, a society's cultural [[tradition]]s. It is a force for [[economic growth]] and a means to develop and project economic, political, military power and wealth.

== Measuring technological progress ==
{{More citations needed section|date=August 2018}}
Many [[sociology|sociologists]] and [[anthropology|anthropologists]] have created [[social theory|social theories]] dealing with [[social evolution|social]] and [[cultural evolution]]. Some, like [[Lewis H. Morgan]], [[Leslie White]], and [[Gerhard Lenski]] have declared [[technological progress]] to be the primary factor driving the development of human civilization. Morgan's concept of three major stages of social evolution (savagery, [[Primitive culture|barbarism]], and [[civilization]]) can be divided by technological milestones, such as [[fire]]. White argued the measure by which to judge the evolution of culture was [[energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knight|first1=Elliot|last2=Smith|first2=Karen|title=American Materialism|url=http://anthropology.ua.edu/cultures/cultures.php?culture=American%20Materialism|website=The University of Alabama – Department of Anthropology|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For White, "the primary function of [[culture]]" is to "harness and control energy." White differentiates between five stages of [[Human development (humanity)|human development]]: In the first, people use the energy of their own muscles. In the second, they use the energy of [[domestication of animals|domesticated animals]]. In the third, they use the energy of plants ([[Neolithic Revolution|agricultural revolution]]). In the fourth, they learn to use the energy of [[natural resource]]s: coal, oil, gas. In the fifth, they harness [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. White introduced a formula P=E*T, where E is a measure of energy consumed, and T is the measure of the efficiency of technical factors using the energy. In his own words, "culture evolves as the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year is increased, or as the efficiency of the instrumental means of putting the energy to work is increased". [[Nikolai Kardashev]] extrapolated his theory, creating the [[Kardashev scale]], which categorizes the energy use of advanced civilizations.

Lenski's approach focuses on [[information]]. The more information and knowledge (especially allowing the shaping of [[natural environment]]) a given society has, the more advanced it is. He identifies four stages of human development, based on advances in the [[history of communication]]. In the first stage, information is passed by [[gene]]s. In the second, when humans gain [[sentience]], they can [[learn]] and pass information through experience. In the third, the humans start using signs and develop [[logic]]. In the fourth, they can create [[symbol]]s, develop [[language]] and [[writing]]. Advancements in [[communications technology]] translate into advancements in the [[economic system]] and [[political system]], [[distribution of wealth]], [[social inequality]] and other spheres of social life. He also differentiates societies based on their level of technology, communication, and economy:
* [[hunter-gatherer]],
* simple [[Agriculture|agricultural]],
* advanced agricultural,
* [[Industry|industrial]],
* special (such as fishing societies).

In economics, [[productivity]] is a measure of technological progress. Productivity increases when fewer inputs (classically labor and capital but some measures include energy and materials) are used in the production of a unit of output. Another indicator of technological progress is the development of new products and services, which is necessary to offset unemployment that would otherwise result as labor inputs are reduced. In developed countries productivity growth has been slowing since the late 1970s; however, productivity growth was higher in some economic sectors, such as manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Way It Worked and Why It Won't: Structural Change and the Slowdown of U.S. Economic Growth |last=Bjork |first= Gordon J.|authorlink= |year= 1999|publisher =Praeger|location= Westport, CT; London|isbn=978-0275965327 |pages=2, 67| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, employment in [[manufacturing in the United States]] declined from over 30% in the 1940s to just over 10% 70 years later. Similar changes occurred in other developed countries. This stage is referred to as ''post-industrial''.

In the late 1970s sociologists and anthropologists like [[Alvin Toffler]] (author of ''[[Future Shock]]''), [[Daniel Bell]] and [[John Naisbitt]] have approached the theories of [[post-industrial society|post-industrial societies]], arguing that the current era of [[industrial society]] is coming to an end, and [[Service (economics)|services]] and information are becoming more important than [[industry]] and [[good (economics)|goods]]. Some extreme visions of the post-industrial society, especially in [[Fictional technology|fiction]], are strikingly similar to the visions of near and post-[[Technological singularity|Singularity]] societies.

==== Stone Age ====
{{Main|Stone Age}}
[[File:Prehistoric Tools - Les Combarelles - Les Eyzies de Tayac - MNP.jpg|thumb|left|A variety of [[stone tool]]s]]
During most of the '''[[Paleolithic]]''' – the bulk of the Stone Age – all humans had a lifestyle which involved limited tools and few permanent settlements. The first major technologies were tied to survival, hunting, and food preparation. [[Stone tools]] and weapons, [[control of fire by early humans|fire]], and [[History of clothing and textiles|clothing]] were technological developments of major importance during this period.

Human ancestors have been using stone and other tools since long before the emergence of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' approximately 200,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501000000*/http://anthropology.si.edu/humanorigins/ha/sap.htm | title=Human Ancestors Hall: Homo sapiens | accessdate=8 December 2007 | publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest methods of [[stone tool]] making, known as the [[Oldowan]] "industry", date back to at least 2.3 million years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/336555.stm | title=Ancient 'tool factory' uncovered | accessdate=18 February 2007 | publisher=BBC News | date=6 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the earliest direct evidence of tool usage found in [[Ethiopia]] within the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Great Rift Valley]], dating back to 2.5 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Environment and Behavior of 2.5-Million-Year-Old Bouri Hominids | last=Heinzelin | first=Jean de | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=April 1999 | volume=284 | issue=5414 | pages=625–629 | doi= 10.1126/science.284.5414.625 | pmid=10213682 | last2=Clark | first2=JD | last3=White | first3=T | last4=Hart | first4=W | last5=Renne | first5=P | last6=Woldegabriel | first6=G | last7=Beyene | first7=Y | last8=Vrba | first8=E}}&lt;/ref&gt; This era of stone tool use is called the ''[[Paleolithic]]'', or "Old stone age", and spans all of human history up to the development of [[agriculture]] approximately 12,000 years ago.

To make a stone tool, a "[[lithic core|core]]" of hard stone with specific flaking properties (such as [[flint]]) was struck with a [[hammerstone]]. This flaking produced sharp edges which could be used as tools, primarily in the form of [[chopper (archaeology)|choppers]] or [[scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]].&lt;ref name="ea_archaeology"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=17 May 2008|url=http://ea.grolier.com/cgi-bin/article?assetid=0019880-04|title=Archaeology|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Americana]]|author=Burke, Ariane |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20080521022936/http://ea.grolier.com/cgi-bin/article?assetid=0019880-04 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 21 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tools greatly aided the early humans in their [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle to perform a variety of tasks including [[butcher]]ing carcasses (and breaking bones to get at the [[Bone marrow|marrow]]); chopping wood; cracking open nuts; skinning an animal for its [[Hide (skin)|hide]], and even forming other tools out of softer materials such as bone and wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Flaked Stones and Old Bones: Biological and Cultural Evolution at the Dawn of Technology|author= Plummer, Thomas|publisher=[[Yearbook of Physical Anthropology]]|year=2004|issue=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest stone tools were irrelevant, being little more than a fractured rock. In the [[Acheulian]] era, beginning approximately 1.65 million years ago, methods of working these stone into specific shapes, such as [[hand axe]]s emerged. This early Stone Age is described as the [[Lower Paleolithic]].

The [[Middle Paleolithic]], approximately 300,000 years ago, saw the introduction of the [[prepared-core technique]], where multiple blades could be rapidly formed from a single core stone.&lt;ref name="ea_archaeology" /&gt; The [[Upper Paleolithic]], beginning approximately 40,000 years ago, saw the introduction of [[pressure flaking]], where a wood, bone, or antler [[punch (engineering)|punch]] could be used to shape a stone very finely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge|author= Haviland, William A.|publisher=[[The Thomson Corporation]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0534624873|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the last Ice Age about 10,000 years ago is taken as the end point of the [[Upper Paleolithic]] and the beginning of the [[Epipaleolithic]] / [[Mesolithic]]. The Mesolithic technology included the use of [[microliths]] as composite stone tools, along with wood, bone, and antler tools.

The later Stone Age, during which the rudiments of agricultural technology were developed, is called the [[Neolithic]] period. During this period, polished [[stone tool]]s were made from a variety of hard rocks such as [[flint]], [[jade]], [[jadeite]], and [[Greenschist|greenstone]], largely by working exposures as quarries, but later the valuable rocks were pursued by tunneling underground, the first steps in mining technology. The polished axes were used for forest clearance and the establishment of crop farming and were so effective as to remain in use when bronze and iron appeared. These stone axes were used alongside a continued use of stone tools such as a range of [[Projectile point|projectiles]], knives, and [[Scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]], as well as tools, made organic materials such as wood, bone, and antler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Zsuzsanna|last1=Tóth | editor1-first=Alexandra |editor1-last=Anders | editor2-first=Zsuzsanna |editor2-last=Siklósi | year=2012 | title=Bone, Antler, and Tusk tools of the Early Neolithic Körös Culture | contribution=The First Neolithic Sites in Central/South-East European Transect, Volume III: The Körös Culture in Eastern Hungary | page= | location=Oxford | publisher=BAR International Series 2334 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone Age cultures developed [[Prehistoric music|music]] and engaged in organized [[Prehistoric warfare|warfare]]. Stone Age humans developed ocean-worthy [[outrigger canoe]] technology, leading to [[History of Papua New Guinea|migration]] across the [[Malay archipelago]], across the Indian Ocean to [[Madagascar]] and also across the Pacific Ocean, which required knowledge of the ocean currents, weather patterns, sailing, and [[celestial navigation]].

Although Paleolithic cultures left no written records, the shift from nomadic life to settlement and agriculture can be inferred from a range of archaeological evidence. Such evidence includes ancient tools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lovgren|first1=Stefan|title=Ancient Tools Unearthed in Siberian Arctic|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/01/0114_040114_siberianhumans.html|website=National Geographic News|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cave painting]]s, and other [[prehistoric art]], such as the [[Venus of Willendorf]]. Human remains also provide direct evidence, both through the examination of bones, and the study of [[mummy|mummies]]. Scientists and historians have been able to form significant inferences about the lifestyle and culture of various prehistoric peoples, and especially their technology.

==== Copper and bronze Ages ====
{{Main|Bronze Age}}

[[File:Sword bronze age (2nd version).jpg|thumb|upright|A late [[Bronze Age sword]] or dagger blade]]

Metallic copper occurs on the surface of weathered copper ore deposits and copper was used before copper [[smelting]] was known.  Copper smelting is believed to have originated when the technology of pottery [[kiln]]s allowed sufficiently high temperatures.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;  The concentration of various elements such as arsenic increase with depth in copper ore deposits and smelting of these ores yields [[arsenical bronze]], which can be sufficiently work hardened to be suitable for making tools.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;  [[Bronze]] is an alloy of copper with tin; the latter being found in relatively few deposits globally caused a long time to elapse before true tin bronze to became widespread. (See: [[Tin sources and trade in ancient times]]) [[Bronze]] was a major advance over stone as a material for making tools, both because of its mechanical properties like strength and ductility and because it could be cast in molds to make intricately shaped objects.  

Bronze significantly advanced shipbuilding technology with better tools and bronze nails.  Bronze nails replaced the old method of attaching boards of the hull with cord woven through drilled holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Sea and Civilization: A Maritime History of the World |last=Paine |first= Lincoln |year= 2013 |publisher =Random House, LLC|location= New York|isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Better ships enabled long distance trade and the advance of civilization. 
   
This technological trend apparently began in the [[Fertile Crescent]] and spread outward over time. These developments were not, and still are not, universal. The [[three-age system]] does not accurately describe the technology history of groups outside of [[Eurasia]], and does not apply at all in the case of some isolated populations, such as the [[Spinifex People]], the [[Sentinelese people|Sentinelese]], and various Amazonian tribes, which still make use of Stone Age technology, and have not developed agricultural or metal technology.

==== Iron Age ====
{{Main|Iron Age}}
[[File:Axe of iron from Swedish Iron Age, found at Gotland, Sweden.jpg|thumb|upright=.6|An [[axe]]head made of iron, dating from the Swedish [[Iron Age]]]]
Before iron smelting was developed the only iron was obtained from meteorites and is usually identified by having nickel content.  [[Meteoric iron]] was rare and valuable, but was sometimes used to make tools and other implements, such as fish hooks.

The '''[[Iron age]]''' involved the adoption of iron [[bloomery|smelting]] technology. It generally replaced bronze and made it possible to produce tools which were stronger, lighter and cheaper to make than bronze equivalents. The raw materials to make iron, such as ore and limestone, are far more abundant than copper and especially tin ores. Consequently, iron was produced in many areas. 

It was not possible to mass manufacture steel or pure iron because of the high temperatures required.  Furnaces could reach melting temperature but the crucibles and molds needed for melting and casting had not been developed.  [[Steel]] could be produced by [[forging]] bloomery iron to reduce the carbon content in a somewhat controllable way, but steel produced by this method was not homogeneous.

In many Eurasian cultures, the Iron Age was the last major step before the development of written language, though again this was not universally the case.

In Europe, large [[hill fort]]s were built either as a refuge in time of war or sometimes as permanent settlements. In some cases, existing forts from the Bronze Age were expanded and enlarged. The pace of land clearance using the more effective iron axes increased, providing more farmland to support the growing population.

==== Egyptians ====
The [[Egyptians]] invented and used many simple machines, such as the [[inclined plane|ramp]] to aid construction processes. Egyptian society made significant advances during dynastic periods in areas such as astronomy, mathematics, and medicine. They also made paper and monuments. The Egyptians made significant advances in shipbuilding. Astronomy was used by Egyptian leaders to govern people.

==== Indus Valley ====
The [[Indus Valley Civilization]], situated in a resource-rich area, is notable for its early application of city planning and sanitation technologies. Indus Valley construction and architecture, called '[[Vaastu Shastra]]', suggests a thorough understanding of materials engineering, hydrology, and sanitation.

==== Mesopotamians ====
The peoples of [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Sumer]]ians, [[Akkad (region)|Akkadians]], [[Assyria]]ns, and [[Babylonia]]ns) have been credited with the invention of the [[wheel]], but this is no longer certain. They lived in cities from c. 4000&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref&gt;JN Postgate, ''Early Mesopotamia'', Routledge (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; and developed a sophisticated architecture in mud-brick and stone,&lt;ref&gt;See entries under [[Nineveh]] and [[Babylon]]&lt;/ref&gt; including the use of the true arch. The walls of Babylon were so massive they were quoted as a [[Wonder of the World]]. They developed extensive water systems; canals for transport and irrigation in the alluvial south, and catchment systems stretching for tens of kilometers in the hilly north. Their palaces had sophisticated drainage systems.&lt;ref name=Dalley2013&gt;S Dalley, ''The Mystery of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon'', Oxford University Press(2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing was invented in Mesopotamia, using the [[cuneiform]] script. Many records on clay tablets and stone inscriptions have survived. These civilizations were early adopters of bronze technologies which they used for tools, weapons and monumental statuary. By 1200&amp;nbsp;BC they could cast objects 5 m long in a single piece. The Assyrian King [[Sennacherib]] (704–681&amp;nbsp;BC) claims to have invented automatic sluices and to have been the first to use water screws, of up to 30 tons weight, which were cast using two-part clay molds rather than by the 'lost wax' process.&lt;ref name=Dalley2013/&gt; The Jerwan Aqueduct (c. 688&amp;nbsp;BC) is made with stone arches and lined with waterproof concrete.&lt;ref&gt;T Jacobsen and S Lloyd, ''Sennacherib's Aqueduct at Jerwan'', Chicago University Press, (1935)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Babylonian astronomical diaries]] spanned 800 years. They enabled meticulous astronomers to plot the motions of the planets and to predict eclipses.&lt;ref&gt;CBF Walker, ''Astronomy before the telescope,'' British Museum Press, (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chinese ====
The Chinese made many first-known discoveries and developments. Major technological contributions from China include early [[Seismometer|seismological detectors]], matches, [[paper]], sliding calipers, the double-action piston pump, [[cast iron]], the iron plough, the multi-tube [[seed drill]], the wheelbarrow, the [[suspension bridge]], the parachute, natural gas as fuel, the [[compass]], the [[raised-relief map]], the propeller, the [[crossbow]], the [[South Pointing Chariot]] and [[gunpowder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius of China: 3000 years of science, discovery and invention |last1=Temple|first1= Robert|coauthors= Joseph Needham|year= 1986|publisher = Simon and Schuster|location=New York |isbn= |pages=| postscript = &lt;Based on the works of Joseph Needham&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Chinese discoveries and inventions from the Medieval period include [[block printing]], [[movable type|movable type printing]], phosphorescent paint, endless power [[chain drive]] and the clock escapement mechanism. The solid-fuel [[rocket]] was invented in China about 1150, nearly 200 years after the invention of [[gunpowder]] (which acted as the rocket's fuel). Decades before the West's age of exploration, the Chinese emperors of the [[Ming Dynasty]] also sent [[Treasure voyages|large fleets]] on maritime voyages, some reaching Africa.

==== Greek ====
[[File:Aeolipile illustration.png|thumb|upright|An illustration of the [[aeolipile]], the earliest steam-powered device]]

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] engineers [[Ancient Greek technology|were responsible for myriad inventions and improvements to existing technology]]. The [[Hellenistic period]], in particular, saw a sharp increase in technological advancement, fostered by a climate of openness to new ideas, the blossoming of a mechanistic philosophy, and the establishment of the [[Library of Alexandria]] and its close association with the adjacent [[museion]]. In contrast to the typically anonymous inventors of earlier ages, ingenious minds such as [[Archimedes]], [[Philo of Byzantium]], [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron]], [[Ctesibius]], and [[Archytas]] remain known by name to posterity.

Ancient Greek innovations were particularly pronounced in mechanical technology, including the ground-breaking invention of the [[watermill]] which constituted the first human-devised motive force not to rely on muscle power (besides the [[sail]]). Apart from their pioneering use of waterpower, Greek inventors were also the first to experiment with wind power (see [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron]]'s windwheel) and even created the earliest steam engine (the [[aeolipile]]), opening up entirely new possibilities in harnessing natural forces whose full potential would not be exploited until the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The newly devised right-angled [[gear]] and [[screw]] would become particularly important to the operation of mechanical devices. That is when the age of mechanical devices started.

[[File:Overshot water wheel schematic.svg|thumb|left|The compartmented water-wheel, here its overshot version, was invented in [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic times]].]]

Ancient agriculture, as in any period prior to the modern age the primary mode of production and subsistence, and its irrigation methods, were considerably advanced by the invention and widespread application of a number of previously unknown water-lifting devices, such as the vertical [[water-wheel]], the compartmented wheel, the water [[turbine]], [[Archimedes' screw]], the bucket-chain and pot-garland, the [[force pump]], the [[suction pump]], the double-action [[piston pump]] and quite possibly the [[chain pump]].&lt;ref name="Lewis 2000 356f."&gt;{{Cite book

In music, the [[water organ]], invented by Ctesibius and subsequently improved, constituted the earliest instance of a [[keyboard instrument]]. In time-keeping, the introduction of the inflow [[Water clock|clepsydra]] and its mechanization by the dial and pointer, the application of a [[feedback|feedback system]] and the [[escapement]] mechanism far superseded the earlier outflow clepsydra.

The famous [[Antikythera mechanism]], a kind of analogous computer working with a [[differential gear]], and the [[astrolabe]] both show great refinement in astronomical science.

Greek engineers were also the first to devise [[automata]] such as [[vending machine]]s, suspended ink pots, automatic [[washstand]]s, and doors, primarily as toys, which however featured many new useful mechanisms such as the [[cam]] and [[gimbal]]s.

In other fields, ancient Greek inventions include the [[catapult]] and the [[gastraphetes]] crossbow in warfare, hollow bronze-casting in metallurgy, the [[dioptra]] for surveying, in infrastructure the [[lighthouse]], [[central heating]], the [[Tunnel of Eupalinos|tunnel excavated from both ends by scientific calculations]], the [[Diolkos|ship trackway]], the [[dry dock]], and plumbing. In horizontal, vertical and transport, great progress resulted from the invention of the [[crane (machine)|crane]], the [[winch]], the [[wheelbarrow]] and the [[odometer]].

Further newly created techniques and items were [[List of ancient spiral stairs|spiral staircases]], the [[chain drive]], [[caliper|sliding calipers]] and [[shower]]s.

==== Roman ====
[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|thumb|[[Pont du Gard]] in France, a Roman aqueduct]]

The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] developed an intensive and sophisticated agriculture, expanded upon existing iron working technology, created [[Roman law|laws]] providing for individual ownership, advanced stone masonry technology, advanced [[Roman road|road-building]] (exceeded only in the 19th century), military engineering, civil engineering, spinning and weaving and several different machines like the [[reaper|Gallic reaper]] that helped to increase productivity in many sectors of the Roman economy. Roman engineers were the first to build monumental arches, [[List of Roman amphitheatres|amphitheatres]], [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[Thermae|public baths]], [[Roman bridge|true arch bridges]], [[harbour]]s, [[reservoir]]s and [[dam]]s, vaults and domes on a very large scale across their Empire. Notable Roman inventions include the [[Codex|book (Codex)]], [[glass blowing]] and [[concrete]]. Because Rome was located on a volcanic peninsula, with sand which contained suitable crystalline grains, the [[concrete]] which the Romans formulated was especially durable. Some of their buildings have lasted 2000 years, to the present day.

==== Inca, Maya, and Aztec ====
The engineering skills of the [[Inca]] and the [[Mayans]] were great, even by today's standards. An example of this great engineering is the use of pieces weighing upwards of one ton in their stonework placed together so that not even a blade can fit into the cracks. Inca villages used irrigation canals and [[drainage]] systems, making agriculture very efficient. While some claim that the Incas were the first inventors of [[hydroponics]], their agricultural technology was still soil based, if advanced.

Though the [[Maya civilization]] did not incorporate metallurgy or wheel technology in their architectural constructions, they developed complex writing and astronomical systems, and created beautiful sculptural works in stone and flint. Like the Inca, the Maya also had command of fairly advanced agricultural and construction technology. The Maya are also responsible for creating the first pressurized water system in Mesoamerica, located in the Maya site of [[Palenque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amp.livescience.com/5959-ancient-mayans-fountains-toilets.html|title=Ancient Mayans Likely Had Fountains and Toilets|date=December 23, 2009|work=Live Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main contribution of the [[Aztec]] rule was a system of communications between the conquered cities and the ubiquity of the ingenious agricultural technology of [[chinampas]]. In [[Mesoamerica]], without draft animals for transport (nor, as a result, wheeled vehicles), the roads were designed for travel on foot, just as in the Inca and Mayan civilizations. The Aztec, subsequently to the Maya, inhereted many of the technologies and intellectual advancements of their predecessors: the [[Olmec]] (see [[Native American inventions and innovations]]).

=== Medieval to early modern ===
One of the most significant development of the Medieval era was the development of economies where water and wind power were more significant than animal and human muscle power.&lt;ref name="Stark_2005"&gt;{{cite book|title= The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism and Western Success|last= Stark|first= Rodney |year= 2005 |publisher =Random House Trade Paperbacks|location= New York |isbn=0-8129-7233-3|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38}} Most water and wind power was used for milling grain.  Water power was also used for blowing air in [[blast furnace]], pulping rags for paper making and for felting wool.  The ''[[Domesday Book]]'' recorded 5,624 water mills in Great Britain in 1086, being about one per thirty families.&lt;ref name="Stark_2005"/&gt;

As earlier empires had done, the Muslim [[caliphate]]s united in trade large areas that had previously traded little. The conquered sometimes paid lower taxes than in their earlier independence, and ideas spread even more easily than goods. Peace was more frequent than it had been. These conditions fostered improvements in agriculture and other technology as well as in sciences which largely adapted from earlier Greek, Roman and Persian empires, with improvements.

==== Medieval Europe ====

[[File:Trebuchet.jpg|thumb|Medieval [[trebuchet|counterweight trebuchet]] (reconstruction)]]

{{Main|Medieval technology}}

While medieval technology has been long depicted as a step backwards in the evolution of Western technology, sometimes willfully so by modern authors intent on denouncing the church as antagonistic to scientific progress (see e.g. [[Myth of the Flat Earth]]), a generation of medievalists around the American historian of science [[Lynn White]] stressed from the 1940s onwards the innovative character of many medieval techniques. Genuine medieval contributions include for example [[mechanical clock]]s, [[spectacles]] and vertical [[windmill]]s. Medieval ingenuity was also displayed in the invention of seemingly inconspicuous items like the [[watermark]] or the [[push button|functional button]]. In navigation, the foundation to the subsequent [[age of exploration]] was laid by the introduction of pintle-and-gudgeon [[rudder]]s, [[lateen sail]]s, the [[dry compass]], the horseshoe and the [[astrolabe]].

Significant advances were also made in military technology with the development of [[plate armour]], steel [[crossbow]]s, [[trebuchet|counterweight trebuchets]] and [[cannon]]. The Middle Ages are perhaps best known for their architectural heritage: While the invention of the [[rib vault]] and [[arch|pointed arch]] gave rise to the high rising [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]], the ubiquitous medieval fortifications gave the era the almost proverbial title of the 'age of castles'.

[[Papermaking]], a 2nd-century Chinese technology, was carried to the Middle East when a group of Chinese papermakers were captured in the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Timeline: 8th century|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191735516.timeline.0001|website=Oxford reference|publisher=HistoryWorld|accessdate=9 April 2015|doi=10.1093/acref/9780191735516.timeline.0001|doi-broken-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papermaking technology was spread to Europe by the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Safita|first1=Neathery|title=A Brief History Of Paper.|url=http://users.stlcc.edu/nfuller/paper/|accessdate=9 April 2015|date=July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper mill was established in Sicily in the 12th century. In Europe the fiber to make pulp for making paper was obtained from linen and cotton rags. [[Lynn Townsend White Jr.]] credited the spinning wheel with increasing the supply of rags, which led to cheap paper, which was a factor in the development of printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==== Renaissance technology ====
{{Main|Renaissance technology}}
[[File:Agricola1.jpg|thumb|left|A water-powered [[mine hoist]] used for raising ore, ca. 1556]]
Before the development of modern engineering, mathematics was used by artisans and craftsmen, such as [[millwright]]s, clock makers, instrument makers and surveyors.  Aside from these professions, universities were not believed to have had much practical significance to technology.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;{{rp|32}}

A standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the Renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise ''[[De re metallica]]'' (1556), which also contains sections on geology, mining and chemistry.  ''De re metallica'' was the standard chemistry reference for the next 180 years.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
|}

Due to the casting of cannon, the [[blast furnace]] came into widespread use in France in the mid 15th century.  The blast furnace had been used in China since the 4th century BC.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius That Was China: East and West in the Making of the Modern World|last1=Merson |first1= John|year= 1990|publisher = The Overlook Press|location=Woodstock, NY |isbn= 978-0879513979|page=69| postscript = A companion to the PBS Series “The Genius That Was China”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the movable cast metal type [[printing press]], whose pressing mechanism was adapted from an olive screw press, (c. 1441) lead to a tremendous increase in the number of books and the number of titles published.  Movable ceramic type had been used in China for a few centuries and woodblock printing dated back even further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius of China: 3000 years of science, discovery and invention |last1=Temple|first1= Robert|year= 1986|publisher = Simon and Schuster|location=New York |isbn= |pages=}}Based on the works of Joseph Needham&lt;/ref&gt;

The era is marked by such profound technical advancements like [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perceptivity]], [[Santa Maria del Fiore|double shell domes]] or [[Bastion fortress]]es. Note books of the Renaissance artist-engineers such as [[Taccola]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] give a deep insight into the mechanical technology then known and applied. Architects and engineers were inspired by the structures of [[Ancient Rome]], and men like [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] created the large dome of [[Florence Cathedral]] as a result. He was awarded one of the first [[patent]]s ever issued in order to protect an ingenious [[crane (machine)|crane]] he designed to raise the large masonry stones to the top of the structure. Military technology developed rapidly with the widespread use of the [[cross-bow]] and ever more powerful [[artillery]], as the city-states of Italy were usually in conflict with one another. Powerful families like the [[Medici]] were strong patrons of the arts and sciences. [[History of science in the Renaissance|Renaissance science]] spawned the [[Scientific Revolution]]; science and technology began a cycle of mutual advancement.

==== Age of Exploration ====
{{Main|Age of Exploration}}

An improved sailing ship, the (nau or [[carrack]]), enabled the [[Age of Exploration]] with the [[European colonization of the Americas]], epitomized by [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]]'s ''[[New Atlantis]]''. Pioneers like [[Vasco da Gama]], [[Pedro Álvares Cabral|Cabral]], [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]] and [[Christopher Columbus]] explored the world in search of new trade routes for their goods and contacts with Africa, India and China to shorten the journey compared with traditional routes overland. They produced new maps and charts which enabled following mariners to explore further with greater confidence. Navigation was generally difficult, however, owing to the [[History of longitude|problem of longitude]] and the absence of accurate [[Marine chronometer|chronometers]]. European powers rediscovered the idea of the [[civil code]], lost since the time of the Ancient Greeks.

====Pre-Industrial Revolution====
The [[stocking frame]], which was invented in 1598, increased a knitter's number of knots per minute from 100 to 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry and Invention|last1=Rosen|first1= William|year= 2012 |publisher = University Of Chicago Press|isbn= 978-0226726342 |page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mines were becoming increasingly deep and were expensive to drain with horse powered bucket and chain pumps and wooden piston pumps. Some mines used as many as 500 horses. Horse-powered pumps were replaced by the [[Thomas Savery#First steam engine mechanism|Savery steam pump]] (1698) and the [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomen steam engine]] (1712).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930, Vol. 2: Steam  Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charolttesville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial Revolution (1760-1830s)===

The British [[Industrial Revolution]] is characterized by developments in the areas of textile machinery, [[mining]], [[metallurgy]] and [[transport]] the [[steam engine]] and the invention of [[machine tool]]s.

Before invention of machinery to spin yarn and weave cloth, spinning was done the spinning wheel and weaving done on a hand and foot operated loom. It took from three to five spinners to supply one weaver.&lt;ref name="Landes_1969"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present |last=Landes |first= David. S.|year= 1969|publisher =Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|location= Cambridge, NY|isbn=  978-0521094184|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayres_1989"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ayres| first = Robert | title =Technological Transformations and Long Waves| year = 1989 |page= | url = http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/RR-89-001.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of the [[flying shuttle]] in 1733 doubled the output of a weaver, creating a shortage of spinners. The [[spinning frame]] for wool was invented in 1738. The [[spinning jenny]], invented in 1764, was a machine that used multiple spinning wheels; however, it produced low quality thread. The [[water frame]] patented by Richard Arkwright in 1767, produced a better quality thread than the spinning jenny. The [[spinning mule]], patented in 1779 by [[Samuel Crompton]], produced a high quality thread.&lt;ref name="Landes_1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayres_1989"/&gt; The [[power loom]] was invented by Edmund Cartwright in 1787.&lt;ref name="Landes_1969"/&gt;

In the mid 1750s the steam engine was applied to the water power-constrained iron, copper and lead industries for powering blast bellows. These industries were located near the mines, some of which were using steam engines for mine pumping. Steam engines were too powerful for leather bellows, so cast iron blowing cylinders were developed in 1768. Steam powered blast furnaces achieved higher temperatures, allowing the use of more lime in iron blast furnace feed. (Lime rich slag was not free-flowing at the previously used temperatures.) With a sufficient lime ratio, sulfur from coal or coke fuel reacts with the slag so that the sulfur does not contaminate the iron. Coal and coke were cheaper and more abundant fuel. As a result, iron production rose significantly during the last decades of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R. F. |year=  1992|publisher =Maney Publishing, for the Institute of Materials |location= London|isbn=978-0901462886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolution was driven by cheap energy in the form of [[coal]], produced in ever-increasing amounts from the abundant resources of [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Coal converted to [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] fueled higher temperature [[blast furnace]]s and produced [[cast iron]] in much larger amounts than before, allowing the creation of a  range of structures such as [[The Iron Bridge]]. Cheap coal meant that industry was no longer constrained by water resources driving the mills, although it continued as a valuable source of power. The steam engine helped drain the mines, so more coal reserves could be accessed, and the output of coal increased. The development of the high-pressure steam engine made locomotives possible, and a transport revolution followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title='The Mechanical Age': technology, innovation and industrialisation|url=https://eastanglia.academia.edu/EmmaGriffin/Books|work=Short History of the British Industrial Revolution|publisher=Palgrave|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[steam engine]] which had existed since the early 18th century, was practically applied to both [[steamboat]] and [[railway]] transportation. The [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], the first purpose built railway line, opened in 1830, the [[Rocket locomotive]] of [[Robert Stephenson]] being one of its first working [[steam locomotive|locomotives]] used.

Manufacture of ships' pulley [[Block and tackle|blocks]] by all-metal machines at the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]] in 1803 instigated the age of sustained [[mass production]]. [[Machine tools]] used by engineers to manufacture parts began in the first decade of the century, notably by [[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Richard Roberts]] and [[Joseph Whitworth]]. The development of [[interchangeable parts]] through what is now called the [[American system of manufacturing]] began in the firearms industry at the U.S Federal arsenals in the early 19th century, and became widely used by the end of the century.

=== Second Industrial Revolution (1860s–1914) ===
{{main|Second Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Stephenson's Rocket.jpg|thumb|left|The preserved ''Rocket'']]

The 19th century saw astonishing developments in transportation, construction, manufacturing and communication technologies originating in Europe. After a recession at the end of the 1830s and a general slowdown in major inventions, the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] was a period of rapid innovation and industrialization that began in the 1860s or around 1870 and lasted until [[World War I]]. It included rapid development of chemical, electrical, petroleum, and steel technologies connected with highly structured technology research.

[[Telegraphy]] developed into a practical technology in the 19th century to help run the railways safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Visible Hand: The Management Revolution in American Business |last=Chandler Jr. |first= Alfred D. |year= 1993|publisher =Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |isbn= 978-0674940529}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the development of telegraphy was the patenting of the first [[telephone]]. March 1876 marks the date that Alexander Graham Bell officially patented his version of an "electric telegraph". Although Bell is noted with the creation of the telephone, it is still debated about who actually developed the first working model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-greatest-inventions-of-the-19th-century.php|title=Top 10 Greatest Inventions of the 19th Century |date=2010-08-09|work=Toptenz.net|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on improvements in vacuum pumps and materials research, [[incandescent light bulb]]s became practical for general use in the late 1870s. This invention had a profound effect on the workplace because factories could now have second and third shift workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology|last=Nye |first=David E.|authorlink= |year=1990 |publisher= The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA, USA and London, England |isbn= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shoe production was mechanized during the mid 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Path to Mechanized Shoe Production in the United States|last=Thomson |first= Ross |authorlink= |year= 1989|publisher =University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0807818671 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass production of [[sewing machine]]s and [[agricultural machinery]] such as reapers occurred in the mid to late 19th century.&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bicycles were mass-produced beginning in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984"/&gt;

Steam-powered factories became widespread, although the conversion from water power to steam occurred in England before in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930, Vol. 2: Steam  Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charolttesville}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ironclad warship]]s were found in battle starting in the 1860s, and played a role in the opening of Japan and China to trade with the West.

=== 20th century ===

[[File:Buzz salutes the U.S. Flag.jpg|thumb|[[Apollo 11|Landing on the Moon]]]]

20th-century technology developed rapidly. Broad teaching and implementation of the [[scientific method]], and increased research spending contributed to the advancement of modern science and technology. New technology improved communication and transport, thus spreading technical understanding.

[[Mass production]] brought [[automobile]]s and other high-tech goods to masses of consumers. [[Military research]] and development sped advances including electronic [[computing]] and [[jet engine]]s. [[Radio]] and [[telephony]] improved greatly and spread to larger populations of users, though near-universal access would not be possible until [[mobile phones]] became affordable to [[developing world]] residents in the late 2000s and early 2010s.

Energy and engine technology improvements included [[nuclear power]], developed after the [[Manhattan project]] which heralded the new [[Atomic Age]]. [[Rocket]] development led to long range missiles and the first [[space age]] that lasted from the 1950s with the launch of Sputnik to the mid-1980s.

[[Electrification]] spread rapidly in the 20th century. At the beginning of the century electric power was for the most part only available to wealthy people in a few major cities such as New York, London, Paris, and Newcastle upon Tyne, but by the time the [[World Wide Web]] was invented in 1990 an estimated 62 percent of homes worldwide had electric power, including about a third of households in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energyfordevelopment.com/2014/11/rural-electrification-by-numbers-1970_2.html|title=Two Billion People Gain Electricity Access: 1970–2010|website=www.energyfordevelopment.com|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rural developing world.

[[Birth control]] also became widespread during the 20th century. [[Electron microscopes]] were very powerful by the late 1970s and genetic theory and knowledge were expanding, leading to developments in [[genetic engineering]].

The first "[[test tube baby]]" [[Louise Brown]] was born in 1978, which led to the first successful [[gestational surrogacy]] pregnancy in 1985 and the first pregnancy by [[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection|ICSI]] in 1991, which is the implanting of a single sperm into an egg. [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] was first performed in late 1989 and led to successful births in July 1990. These procedures have become relatively common.

The massive data analysis resources necessary for running transatlantic research programs such as the [[Human Genome Project]] and the [[Large Electron-Positron Collider]] led to a necessity for distributed communications, causing Internet protocols to be more widely adopted by researchers and also creating a justification for [[Tim Berners-Lee]] to create the [[World Wide Web]].

[[Vaccination]] spread rapidly to the developing world from the 1980s onward due to many successful humanitarian initiatives, greatly reducing childhood mortality in many poor countries with limited medical resources.

The US [[National Academy of Engineering]], by expert vote, established the following ranking of the most important technological developments of the 20th century:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greatest Engineering Achievements of the 20th Century|url=http://www.greatachievements.org/|website=greatachievements.org|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st century ===

[[File:NASA Mars Rover.jpg|thumb|The [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s have provided huge amounts of information by functioning well beyond NASA's original lifespan estimates.]]

{{Main|2000s in science and technology}}

In the early 21st century research is ongoing into [[quantum computers]], [[gene therapy]] (introduced 1990), [[3D printing]] (introduced 1981), [[nanotechnology]] (introduced 1985), [[bioengineering]]/[[biotechnology]], [[nuclear technology]], [[Materials science|advanced materials]] (e.g., graphene), the [[scramjet]] and [[Unmanned combat air vehicle|drones]] (along with [[railgun]]s and high-energy laser beams for military uses), [[superconductivity]], the [[memristor]], and green technologies such as [[alternative fuel]]s (e.g., [[fuel cells]], self-driving electric and plug-in hybrid cars), [[augmented reality]] devices and [[wearable electronics]], [[artificial intelligence]], and more efficient and powerful [[LEDs]], [[solar cells]], [[integrated circuits]], [[wireless power]] devices, engines, and [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]].

Perhaps the greatest research tool built in the 21st century is the [[Large Hadron Collider]], the largest single machine ever built. The understanding of [[particle physics]] is expected to expand with better instruments including larger [[particle accelerator]]s such as the LHC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World's Largest Science Experiment comes to Northern Ireland|url=https://www.stfc.ac.uk/2668.aspx|website=Science &amp; Technology Facilities Council|accessdate=9 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413064023/https://www.stfc.ac.uk/2668.aspx|archivedate=13 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and better [[neutrino detector]]s. [[Dark matter]] is sought via underground detectors and observatories like [[LIGO]] have started to detect [[gravitational wave]]s.

Genetic engineering technology continues to improve, and the importance of [[epigenetics]] on development and inheritance has also become increasingly recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2006/nov/cover|title=DNA Is Not Destiny: The New Science of Epigenetics |publisher=DiscoverMagazine.com|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New [[spaceflight]] technology and [[spacecraft]] are also being developed, like the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] and [[Dragon V2|Dragon]]. New, more capable [[Space observatory|space telescopes]], such as the [[James Webb Space Telescope|James Webb Telescope]], to be launched to orbit in early 2021, and the [[Extremely large telescope#Colossus Telescope|Colossus Telescope]] are being designed. The [[International Space Station]] was completed in the 2000s, and [[NASA]] and [[ESA]] plan a [[manned mission to Mars]] in the 2030s. The [[Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket]] (VASIMR) is an electro-magnetic thruster for spacecraft propulsion and is expected to be tested in 2015.

[[Breakthrough Initiatives]], together with famed physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], plan to send [[Breakthrough Starshot|the first ever spacecraft to visit another star]], which will consist of numerous super-light chips driven by [[Electric propulsion]] in the 2030s, and receive images of the [[Proxima Centauri]] system, along with, possibly, the [[List of potentially habitable exoplanets|potentially habitable planet]] [[Proxima Centauri b]], by midcentury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/Initiative/3|title=Breakthrough Initiatives|website=breakthroughinitiatives.org|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2004 saw the [[SpaceShipOne flight 15P|first manned commercial spaceflight]] when [[Mike Melvill]] crossed the [[boundary of space]] on June 21, 2004.

'''ILIAS''' (Integriertes Lern-, Informations- und Arbeitskooperations-System [German for "Integrated Learning, Information and Work Cooperation System"]) is an [[open-source software|open-source]] web-based [[learning management system]] (LMS). It supports learning content management (including [[SCORM]] 2004 compliance) and tools for collaboration, communication, evaluation and assessment. The software is published under the [[GNU General Public License]] and can be run on any server that supports [[PHP]] and [[MySQL]].

== History ==
ILIAS is one of the first Learning Management Systems that have been used in universities. A prototype has been developed since end of 1997 within the VIRTUS project at the Faculty of Management, Economics and Social Sciences of the [[University of Cologne]], initiated and organized by [[Wolfgang Leidhold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ILIAS Ehrenpreis für Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Leidhold |url=https://www.ilias.de/docu/goto_docu_cat_4857.html |website=ILIAS.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 2, 1998 version 1 of the learning management system ILIAS was published and offered for learning at the Cologne faculty of business administration, economics and social sciences. Due to increasing interest of other universities, the project team decided to publish ILIAS as open source software under the [[GPL]] in 2000. Between 2002 and 2004, a new ILIAS version was developed from scratch and called "ILIAS 3". In 2004, it became the first open source LMS that reached full [[SCORM]] (Sharable Content Object Reference Model) 1.2 compliance. SCORM 2004 compliance has been reached with version 3.9 in November 2007.

== ILIAS Concept ==
The idea behind ILIAS is to offer a flexible environment for learning and working online with integrated tools. ILIAS goes far beyond the idea of learning being confined to courses as a lot of other LMS do. ILIAS can rather be seen as a type of library providing learning and working materials and contents at any location of the repository. This offers the possibility to run ILIAS not as a locked warehouse but as an open knowledge platform where content might be made available for non-registered users too.

== Features ==
ILIAS offers a lot of features to design and run online-courses, create learning content, offer assessments and exercises, run surveys and support communication and cooperation among users.

=== Personal Desktop ===
A general characteristic of ILIAS is the concept of Personal Desktop and Repository. While the Repository contains all content, courses and other materials structured in categories and described by metadata, the Personal Desktop is the individual workspace of each learner, author, tutor and administrator. The Personal Desktop contains selected items from the repository (e.g. currently visited courses or an interesting forum) as well as certain tools like mail, tagging, a calendar and also e-portfolio and personal blogs.

* Listing of selected courses, groups and learning resources
* Personal profile and settings like password and system language
* Bookmark Management
* Personal Notes
* External Web Feeds
* Internal News
* Personal Workspace
* Blogs
* e-Portfolio
* Calendar
* Internal Mail
* Personal Learning Progress

=== Learning Content Management ===
Another important characteristic of ILIAS is the repository. All learning content but also forums or chat rooms, tests and surveys, as well as plugged in virtual classrooms or other external tools are created, offered and administrated in the repository and its categories. Therefore, it is not necessary to build up courses for offering learning content. ILIAS could also be used like a kind of knowledge base or website. Access to all repository item is granted by the [[role-based access control]] (RBAC) of ILIAS. The repository is structured as tree with a root node and multiple levels. Each repository item is assigned to one node in the RBAC tree.

ILIAS offers four kinds of container for delivering content:
* Categories
* Courses incl. member administration
* Groups incl. member administration
* Folders (within courses and groups)

Container objects can be extended by using the page editor for adding text, images or videos to the page.

All content objects are handled as references. They can be moved, copied or linked into other branches of the repository tree. A file that has already been uploaded can be linked multiple times in different courses and categories without being uploaded a second time.

=== Course Management ===
* Enrollment Settings
* Learning Resource Management
* Time triggered/Conditional Access
* Learning Progress Tracking for Members
* Member Gallery and (Google) Map

* Online exams
* Learning progress control

=== Evaluation ===
* Personalised and anonymous surveys
* Question types: Multiple choice, matrix, open answer

'''Intergraph Corporation''' is an [[United States|American]] software development and services company. It provides enterprise engineering and geospatially powered software to businesses, governments, and organizations around the world. Intergraph operates through three divisions: Hexagon PPM, Hexagon Safety &amp; Infrastructure, and Hexagon Geospatial. The company’s headquarters is in Huntsville, Alabama, United States. 

In 2008, Intergraph was one of the one hundred largest software companies in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Software Top 100 |url=http://www.softwaretop100.org |title=The World's Largest Software Companies}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, Intergraph was acquired by [[Hexagon AB]].

==History==
[[File:M&amp;S Computing exhibit 1978.agr.jpg|left|thumb|M&amp;S Computing exhibit at a trade show in 1978]]
Intergraph was founded in 1969 as M&amp;S Computing, Inc., by former [[IBM]] engineers  Jim
Meadlock, his wife Nancy, Terry Schansman (the S of M&amp;S), Keith Schonrock, and
Robert Thurber who had been working with [[NASA]] and the [[U.S. Army]] in developing systems that would apply [[digital computing]] to real time missile guidance. The company was later renamed to ''Intergraph Corporation'' in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cadhistory.net/14%20Intergraph.pdf |title=The Engineering Design Revolution: The People, Companies and Computer Systems That Changed Forever the Practice of Engineering |last=Weisberg |first=David |year=2008 |at=Chapter 14 |language=English |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304191600/http://www.cadhistory.net/14%20Intergraph.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |dead-url=no |access-date=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Intergraph exited the hardware business and became purely a software company. On July 21, 2000, it sold its Intense3D graphics accelerator division to [[3Dlabs]], and its [[workstation]] and [[server (computing)|server]] division to [[Silicon Graphics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secinfo.com/dAmt6.5j.htm |title=SEC quarterly result mentioning the sales of graphic accelerator and computer activities |publisher=Secinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The companies incorporated [[SmartSketch]], a drawing program used previously for the [[PenPoint OS]] and [[EO Personal Communicator|EO tablet computer]]. When [[Pen computing]] did not take off, SmartSketch was ported to the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Macintosh]] platforms.&lt;ref name='Intergraph'&gt;[http://www.intergraph.com/products/ppm/smartsketch/Downloads.aspx Intergraph's smartsketch]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='cadinfo'&gt;[http://www.cadinfo.net/s12-cad-product-information/c75-software/smartsketch-v40/ Intergraph's smartsketch (cadinfo)]&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 29, 2006, Intergraph was acquired by an investor group led by [[Hellman &amp; Friedman]] LLC, [[Texas Pacific Group]] and [[JMI Equity]], making the company privately held. On October 28, 2010, Intergraph was acquired by [[Hexagon AB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cisionwire.com/hexagon/approvals-for-hexagon-s-acquisition-of-intergraph-obtained50071|title=Hexagon AB - Press release|publisher=''[[Cision|Cision Wire]]''|accessdate=2010-10-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729035011/http://www.cisionwire.com/hexagon/approvals-for-hexagon-s-acquisition-of-intergraph-obtained50071|archivedate=2012-07-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transaction marks the return of Intergraph as part of a publicly traded company. 

As part of the Hexagon acquisition, Hexagon moved the management of ERDAS, Inc. from under Leica Geosystems to Intergraph, and Z/I Imaging airborne imaging sensors from under Intergraph to Leica Geosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intergraph and ERDAS: From GeoMedia to IMAGINE-The Big and Little Picture for this Geospatial Marriage|url=http://apb.directionsmag.com/entry/intergraph-and-erdas-from-geomedia-to-imagine-the-big-and-little-pictu/182796 |accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 2013, the geospatial technology portfolio was split out from  under the Intergraph Security, Government and Infrastructure division to form the Hexagon Geospatial division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hexagon Announces Changes within Technology Division and New Appointments to Group Management|url=http://investors.hexagon.com/en/news-releases?afw_id=1300899|accessdate=2013-12-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119045414/http://investors.hexagon.com/en/news-releases?afw_id=1300899|archivedate=2014-01-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 13, 2015, the Intergraph Security, Government &amp; Infrastructure division was rebranded as Hexagon Safety &amp; Infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intergraph SG&amp;I Becomes Hexagon Safety &amp; Infrastructure|url=http://www.hexagonsafetyinfrastructure.com/news-releases/intergraph-sgi-becomes-hexagon-safety-and-infrastructure|accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 9, 2017, the Intergraph Government Solutions division was rebranded as Hexagon US Federal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intergraph Government Solutions Announces Corporate Name Change to Hexagon US Federal|url=http://hexagonusfederal.com/about-us/news/hexagon-us-federal-announcement|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On June 5, 2017, the Intergraph Process, Power &amp; Marine division was rebranded as Hexagon PPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hexagon PPM is the New Brand for Intergraph® Process, Power &amp; Marine|url=https://hexagonppm.com/en/news/rebrand-to-hexagon-ppm|accessdate=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Washball.jpg|right|thumb|The Swedish "Magicball" is an example of a pseudoscientific washing ball product.]]

A '''laundry ball''' or '''washing ball''' is a product that is promoted as a substitute for [[laundry detergent]]. Producers of laundry balls often make [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] claims about how these balls work and exaggerate the extent of their benefits.&lt;ref name="dope"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scientific american"/&gt;

In the US {{as of|1998|lc=y}} the product was often sold on [[home shopping]] channels or by participants in [[multilevel marketing]],&lt;ref name="dope"&gt;{{cite news |first=Cecil |last= Adams |authorlink=Cecil Adams |title= Do laundry balls really work?|url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a4_007b.html |work= |publisher=[[The Straight Dope]] |location= |id= |page=1 |date=1997-07-25 |accessdate=2008-02-25 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="skeptic"&gt;{{citation |title= The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience |publisher= ABC-CLIO |editor= Michael Shermer, Pat Linse |chapter= Laundry Balls |author= Roahn H. Wynar |pages= 130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this is not the case in all countries.

While many individuals report that these balls work, most test results show them to be similar to or less effective than washing in water without any detergent.&lt;ref name="stein"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollings.mmu.ac.uk/~dtyler/ecochallenge/LAUNDRY_BALLS.htm |title=Laundry Balls |publisher=Faculty of Food, Clothing and Hospitality Management at [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] |author=Dorothy Stein |date=1997-10-27 |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=publico /&gt; Most of the effect can be attributed to the mechanical effect of the ball or to using hot water instead of cold water.&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ocu/&gt;

The US  [[Federal Trade Commission]] has taken action against some of the manufacturers of these products because of their misleading claims.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: [http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/1999/04/marketers-laundry-detergent-substitutes-charged-making-false-and Marketers of Laundry Detergent Substitutes Charged with Making False and Unsubstantiated Claims Agree to Settlements with FTC and Eleven States] and [http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/1999/07/dallas-marketers-laundry-detergent-substitute-charged-making Dallas Marketers of Laundry Detergent Substitute Charged with Making False and Unsubstantiated Claims Agree to Settlement with FTC and Six States], [[Federal Trade Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer organizations from several countries have recommended against buying this type of product.&lt;!--there are several organizations listed in the body of the article, with sources--&gt;

==Types of laundry ball==
There are several shapes of laundry balls: laundry disks, globes, spheres or doughnuts.&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mendelson /&gt; Some of the balls carry components inside, like ceramic pieces, magnetic material or coloured liquid that is claimed to be "activated water".&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mendelson /&gt; Manufacturers claim that these components have certain effects on washing efficacy, although studies don't show any difference between the different types of balls.&lt;ref name=mendelson /&gt; Some balls can be refilled with pellets of special detergent, or other ingredients.&lt;ref name=pellets1/&gt;&lt;ref name=pellets2/&gt;

==Benefits claimed by manufacturers==
Laundry balls are marketed as cheaper, [[Environment (biophysical)|environmentally]] friendly alternatives to ordinary washing powders or liquids. The manufacturers claim the following benefits, which are technically real:

* Lack of chemicals which may harm the environment&lt;ref name="skeptic" /&gt;
* Hypoallergenic and anti-irritation. 
* Reduced water usage (because less rinsing is required – this assumes the customer uses a different setting on their washing machine)
* Reduced use of energy by using cold water (see [[embodied energy]])&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt;
* Can be re-used many times before refilling or replacing.&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt; This can range from 60 to 2000 wash loads

But they also claim many benefits that laundry balls do not have, according to many studies:

* Removing stains as effectively as detergents&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;
* Removing germs and bacteria as effectively as detergents.&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;&lt;ref name=publico /&gt;
* Removing odors&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;	 
* Effective as bleacher&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;	 
* Effective as softener&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;
* Softening [[hard water]]&lt;ref name=magscams /&gt;
* Changing the [[pH]] of water&lt;ref name=magscams /&gt;
* Breaking molecule "clusters" in water, allowing easier penetration into the fabric&lt;ref name="miracle"/&gt;

However, the real effects are comparable to those of washing without any detergent&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ocu /&gt;&lt;ref name=mendelson&gt;{{citation |title= Laundry: the home comforts book of caring for clothes and linens |author= Cheryl Mendelson |edition= illustrated |publisher= Simon and Schuster |year= 2005 |pages= 82, 83 |isbn= 9780743271455 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6-gRK9HMQKoC }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are sometimes worse.&lt;ref name=publico /&gt;&lt;ref name="ftc daze"/&gt;

==Possible dangers==
The laundry ball could break open during washing, and the ceramic pieces inside it could damage the machinery of the washing machine.&lt;ref name=publico /&gt;

==Claimed mechanisms of action==
Manufacturers rarely agree on why their laundry balls work, hinting that these claims are just made up by each individual manufacturer.&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;&lt;ref name=magscams /&gt; Some claims are not backed by science, while others are an exaggeration of benefits.&lt;ref name="scientific american"/&gt; Balls that contain detergents may offer more cleaning power than water alone because their ingredients are comparable to normal washing powder, but in smaller quantities. It is claimed that conventional washing powder manufacturers recommend using more powder than is necessary, and that these powders contain unnecessary fillers or fragrances.&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt;

The effect of the laundry balls may be explained by simple mechanical action and by the usage of hotter water. Some manufacturers claim that their products reduce energy consumption, but their pamphlets recommend using hot water.&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt; Hot water will clean some types of spots better than cold water,&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ocu/&gt; leading some people to conclude that the balls worked. The mechanical action of the laundry balls can help clean some types of spots,&lt;ref name="stein"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ocu/&gt; but a golf ball will achieve the same effect for much less money.&lt;ref name="scientific american"&gt;{{citation |title= Bunkum! Broad-mindedness is a virtue when investigating extraordinary claims, but often they turn out to be pure bunk (Skeptic column) |author= [[Michael Shermer]] |work= [[Scientific American]] |page= 36 |date= January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infrared===
Some manufacturers claim that the components inside their balls emit [[far infrared]] rays, which are claimed to reduce the surface tension of water and facilitate washing.&lt;ref name=mendelson/&gt; The claim of emitting infrared is not false, as almost all materials emit [[Thermal radiation|"far infrared waves"]] at [[room temperature]], in other words, [[heat]] radiation.&lt;ref name=stein/&gt; It is also true that [[Surface tension#Influence of temperature|heating reduces the surface tension of water]], but the effect of the radiation emitted by the balls is negligible compared to the radiation emitted by the internal walls of the washing machine or by the water, especially if the water is hot.&lt;ref name=stein/&gt;

===Magnetic properties===
{{Main|Magnetic water treatment}}
Magnetic water softeners claim that their magnetic fields can help remove [[limescale|scale]] from the washing machine and pipes, and prevent new limescale from adhering.&lt;ref name=magscams /&gt; Some companies claim to remove hardness ions from hard water, or to precipitate the molecules in the water so they won't "stick" to the pipes, or to reduce the surface tension of water.&lt;ref name=magscams /&gt; The claims are dubious, the scientific basis is unclear, the working mechanism is vaguely defined and understudied, and high-quality studies report negative results.&lt;ref name=magscams /&gt; The reputation of these products is further damaged by the pseudoscientific explanations that promoters keep putting forward.&lt;ref name=magscams&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chem1.com/CQ/magscams.html |author=Stephen Lower |title=Magnetic water treatment pseudoscience |publisher=Chem1.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes to water structure===
Some magnetic products claim that they "change the molecular structure of water",&lt;ref name="ftc daze"&gt;{{citation |title= Wash Daze: Laundry Gadgets Won't Lighten the Load |author= FTC Consumer Alert |date= 1 April 1999 |url= http://www.bbb.org/us/article/ftc--wash-daze-laundry-gadgets-wont-lighten-the-load-4445 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a pseudoscientific claim with no real scientific basis.&lt;ref name="scientific american"/&gt; There is no such thing as "magnetized water".&lt;ref name=magscams /&gt; Water is not [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]], so its water molecules do not align in the presence of a magnetic field.&lt;ref name=magscams /&gt; Water is weakly [[Diamagnetism|diamagnetic]] (so it is repelled by magnets), but only to an extent so small that it is undetectable to most instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Magnetized water: pseudoscientific snake oil |author=Stephen Lower |url= http://www.chem1.com/CQ/magwatscams.html |publisher=Chem1.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special detergent===
Some balls are refillable with small pellets of detergent which are sold only by the manufacturer of the ball. Critics question whether the amount and type of detergent released by these balls is sufficient to generate significant cleaning effects.&lt;ref name=pellets1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grownupgreen.org.uk/features/?id=1078&amp;PHPSESSID=2833b2dc91d17b76b4520775c06b78f0 |title=More on green washing... |publisher=grownupgreen |date=2006-11-17 |accessdate=2010-07-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623014122/http://www.grownupgreen.org.uk/features/?id=1078&amp; |archivedate=2007-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pellets2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeremyjohnstone.com/blog/2008-05-11-ecoballs-are-they-for-real.html |title=EcoBalls&amp;nbsp;– Are they for real? &amp;#124; Ramblings of a Geek |publisher=Jeremy Johnstone |date=2008-05-11 |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer protection==
In 1997, [[Amway]] offered a ceramic washing disk on its catalogue, but removed it after concluding that it had "no measurable impact on overall cleaning."&lt;ref name="dope"/&gt;

In 1997 Trade-Net, sold a laundry ball product (the Blue Laundry Ball) in various US states. Trade-Net claimed that the blue liquid inside their balls was structured water "that emits a negative charge through the walls of the container into your laundry water." "This causes the water molecule cluster to disassociate, allowing much smaller individual water molecules to penetrate into the innermost part of the fabric." Dennis Barnum, a professor of inorganic chemistry at [[Portland State University]], said that the liquid was just water with a blue dye and couldn't possibly have the effect claimed by the manufacturer. Barnum also said that the claims were "gibberish" and used scientific terms in ways that sounded educated to the layman but didn't make any real sense. [[The Oregonian]] tested the balls, and found they washed marginally better than hot water with no detergent, and worse than using detergent.&lt;ref name="miracle"&gt;{{citation |title= 'Miracle' Clothes-Washing Device Investigated |journal= The Columbian |date= 1997-05-11 |author= AP | url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23377293.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After complaints, Trade-Net's claims were investigated by consumer protection departments in [[Utah]], Oregon and Florida, amongst others, and the company was prohibited from making certain claims, including that "such product cleans as well as conventional laundry detergent". Trade-Net offered a 'new' laundry ball product after this, but were forced to pay fines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1999/04/tradenet.shtm | title = Marketers of Laundry Detergent Substitutes Charged with Making False and Unsubstantiated Claims Agree to Settlements with FTC and Eleven States | date = April 22, 1999 | publisher = [[Federal Trade Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; including $190,000 to Oregon's Department of Justice, $10,000 to Utah and then in April 1999, $155,000 to the states of New York, Arizona, Arkansas, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma and the FTC. The company disappeared shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Sources:

The judge ruling against Trade-Net, issued in April 1999, said the manufacturers failed to substantiate their claims and hadn't informed consumers about reports showing that the claims were incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Laundry Balls Outlawed |journal= [[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]] |author= [[Associated Press|AP]] |date= 1999-03-22 |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-56222067.html }} (require registration)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Government Says Laundry Ball Businesses Deceptive |journal= [[The Columbian]] |date= 1999-04-25 |author= AP |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23417426.html}} (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Consumers' Association]] published a report in the April 1998 issue of its magazine ''Choice''. It concluded that laundry balls were no better than cold water.&lt;ref name=stein/&gt;

The US [[Federal Trade Commission]] published in 1999 about laundry balls, rings and discs: "Tests show that these gadgets do little more than clean out your wallet. At best, they’re marginally better than washing clothes in hot water alone, and not as effective as washing them with laundry detergent. At worst, the products are completely useless."&lt;ref name="ftc daze"/&gt;

In 2000 the magazine ''Good Housekeeping'' tested several laundry balls sold in the US and concluded that "these gizmos do little more than clean out your wallet."&lt;ref name="housekeeping2000"/&gt;

In April 2009 the Italian consumer association [[Altroconsumo]] carried a small test and concluded that laundry balls didn't wash better than plain water.&lt;ref name=alco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altroconsumo.it/vita-privata-famiglia/nc/news/biowashball-senza-detersivo-e-si-vede |title=Biowashball: senza detersivo, e si vede - Altroconsumo |publisher=Altroconsumo.it |date= |accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the Spanish consumer organization OCU made a study of "ecobolas" (a type of laundry ball marketed in Spain). It compared the efficacy of the laundry ball, normal detergent, and no detergent at all. It concluded that laundry balls were no better than using just water, and it recommended that consumers simply use a minimum amount of detergent.&lt;ref name=ocu&gt;{{citation |journal= Compra Maestra |issue= 340 |publisher= OCU [[Organización de Consumidores y Usuarios]] |date=September 2009 |title= Ecobola: como lavar con agua |language= Spanish |url= http://www.ocu.org/equipamiento-del-hogar/ecobola-como-lavar-con-agua-s465574.htm |quote= [translation] In conclusion, the results of the Ecobola are far from those obtained with detergent. We can well attribute its "washing efficacy" to the mechanical action of the washing machine and to the temperature of the washing water... with which using this product is practically the same as washing only with water. (...) The advice of the OCU: if you want to spend less money and reduce residues, choose one of the detergents recommended in our last analysis and experiment until finding the minimal dosis that gives you good results. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the Hong Kong Consumer Council published a report on the effect of using washing liquid, washing powder and washing balls. The former two were shown to be effective in removing stains, while the washing balls were not more effective than plain water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumer.org.hk/website/ws_en/news/press_releases/p42104.html|title=Cleaning Power of Washing Balls No Better Than Plain Water&amp;nbsp;– Choice # 421 (November 15, 2011)|last=|first=|date=2011-11-15|publisher=Hong Kong Consumer Council|accessdate=2016-08-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128005202/http://www.consumer.org.hk/website/ws_en/news/press_releases/p42104.html|archivedate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organizations recommending against their use are [[Consumers Union]],&lt;ref name=mendelson/&gt; International Fabricare Institute (now called [[Drycleaning and Laundry Institute]]),&lt;ref name=mendelson/&gt; [[Maytag]],&lt;ref name=mendelson/&gt; [[Soap and Detergent Association]]&lt;ref name=mendelson/&gt; and Spanish [[Organización de Consumidores y Usuarios|OCU]].&lt;ref name=ocu/&gt;

In February 2011 the Spanish National Institute of Consume ([[Instituto Nacional del Consumo]] INC) ordered 14 manufacturers to cease their deceiving advertisement after testing the wash balls and concluding that they are as effective, or even ''less'' effective, than washing with water alone.&lt;ref name=publico&gt;[http://www.publico.es/359796/sanidad-frena-el-timo-de-la-ecobola Sanidad frena el timo de la 'ecobola'. El Instituto Nacional de Consumo requiere a 14 fabricantes que acaben con la publicidad engañosa de estos productos], [[Público (Spain)|''Público'']], Ainhoa Iriberri, 5 February 2011, Spanish. "The Instituto Nacional del Consumo (INC) has required the manufacturers of laundry balls (...) (also called ecoballs) to cease their deceiving publicity (...) The requirement has been issued after the making (...) of a study on 14 brands of ecoballs, made to find out the most obvious: if it's true that they are effective to wash clothes. The results of the work offer no doubts: the laundry balls do clean, yes, but the same or even less than water."&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012 the Portuguese Consumer Rights Council requested a ban on the washing balls because none of the advantages advertised were proven in tests.&lt;ref name=DN&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20120829184116/http://www.dn.pt/inicio/economia/interior.aspx?content_id%3D2741145 DECO exige retirada do mercado das "ecobolas"], [[Diário de Notícias (Portugal)|''Diário de Notícias'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian consumer advocacy group (Choice Australia) gave a 'Shonky Award' to Nanosmart Laundry Balls in October 2015, stating that they "don't work" and that they should be renamed "Nano-not-so-smart" after testing the balls against plain water and finding they had no effect and that their scientific claims were simply untrue. Choice Australia states that they will refer the product to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for investigation over Nanosmart's misleading claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.choice.com.au/shonkyaward/hall-of-shame/shonkys-2015/shonky-2015-nanosmart-laundry-balls.aspx|title=Shonkys 2015&amp;nbsp;– Nanosmart Cleaning Balls|date=2015-10-07|publisher=Choice Australia|accessdate=2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By making very vague claims, marketers can continue to sell laundry balls without running afoul of consumer protection laws that require veracity in advertisement.&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;

==Selling channels==
The product is often sold by participants in [[multilevel marketing]].&lt;ref name="dope"/&gt;&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt; They can also be found in ecological retail stores.&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;

During the initial marketing boom, balls were manufactured for other market niches, like washing cars.&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;

The LifeStraw [[water filter]]s are designed by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-based [[Vestergaard Frandsen]]. While originally developed for people living in [[developing nation]]s and for distribution in [[humanitarian crisis]], the LifeStraw has gained popularity as a consumer product. The LifeStraw is now used as a tool for survivalists and packed in emergency preparedness kits in addition to being used to help combat clean [[water scarcity]] worldwide. LifeStraw personal filters can provide clean water for up to a year, and the LifeStraw Family filters a maximum of 18,000 litres of water, providing safe [[drinking water]] for a family of five for up to three years. 

LifeStraw and LifeStraw Family were distributed in the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], [[2010 Pakistan floods]], [[2011 Thailand floods]], and [[2016 Ecuador earthquake]], among other crises and initiatives. In the [[Mutomo District]] in [[Kenya]] which has suffered from long term drought, the Kenya Red Cross supplied filters to 3,750 school children and 6,750 households.&lt;ref name=waterfilters&gt;{{cite news|last=Muasya|first=Phillip|title=Kenya: Lifestraw Water Filters Saving Lives in Mutomo|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201107040155.html?viewall=1|accessdate=17 March 2013|newspaper=The Star|date=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, LifeStraw filters were deployed in [[Rwanda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Thiebes| first = Joseph| title = SWEETLab deploys half million water filters in Rwanda| work = Portland State Vanguard| accessdate = 2015-04-21| date = 2015-02-23| url = http://psuvanguard.com/news/sweetlab-deploys-half-million-water-filters-in-rwanda/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The LifeStraw is a [[plastic]] tube 22&amp;nbsp;cm long and 3&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Friend| first = Gil| title = The LifeStraw| work = Worldchanging - Evaluation + Tools + Best Practices| accessdate = 2015-04-21| url = http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/003388.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water that is drawn up through the straw first passes through hollow fibres that filter water particles down to 0.2&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] across, using only physical filtration methods and no chemicals. The entire process is powered by suction, similar to using a conventional [[drinking straw]], and filters up to 4000 litres of water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vestergaard-frandsen.com/lifestraw/lifestraw/longevity-and-efficacy Longevity and Efficacy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129155546/http://www.vestergaard-frandsen.com/lifestraw/lifestraw/longevity-and-efficacy |date=2011-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the initial model of the filter did not remove ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19121634/site/newsweek/page/0/ Water for The World], [[MSNBC]], By Jennie Yabroff,
6/12/07.&lt;/ref&gt; LifeStraw now removes a minimum of 98.9% of waterborne protozoan parasites including ''[[Giardia]]'' and ''[[Cryptosporidium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vestergaard-frandsen.com/component/content/article/38-lifestraw/128-does-lifestraw-remove-parasites-like-cryptosporidium-and-giardia|title=Vestergaard - Impacting People|website=www.vestergaard-frandsen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the standard LifeStraw is ineffective in filtering viruses, chemicals, salt water, and heavy metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifestraw.com/faqs/|title=LifeStraw - We make contaminated water safe to drink.|website=LifeStraw}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the newer LifeStraw products (like LifeStraw Flex &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lifestraw.com/products/lifestraw-flex/|title=LifeStraw Flex - LifeStraw|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are capable of removing chemicals and heavy metals including lead.

==Critical response==
LifeStraw has been generally praised for its effective and instant method of bacteria and protozoa removal and consumer acceptability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vestergaard-frandsen.com/lifestraw/lifestraw/customer-acceptability|title=Vestergaard - Impacting People|website=www.vestergaard-frandsen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although LifeStraw is available for retail sale in the developed world,  the majority of LifeStraw are distributed as part of [[public health]] campaigns or in response to complex emergencies by [[NGO]]s and organizations that give them away for free in the developing world.&lt;ref name=DAWN&gt;[http://news.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/sci-tech/35-The-force-behind-LifeStraw-ak-03 The force behind LifeStraw]&lt;/ref&gt;

LifeStraw has been praised in the international media and won several awards including the 2008 [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]] Award for World Changing Ideas, the ‘IDEX: 2005’ International Design Award and "Best Invention of 2005" by ''[[Time Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vestergaard.com/lifestraw-personal|title=Awards|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LifeStraw was featured in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2010/04/features/work-smarter-vestergaard-frandsen|title=Work Smarter: Vestergaard Frandsen|last=Cheshire|first=Tom|date=1 March 2010|work=Wired|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liter of Light''' is an [[open source]] design for a low-cost [[light tube]] that refracts solar light to provide daytime interior lighting for dwellings with thin roofs. [[Daylighting]] is cheaper than using indoor electric lights during the day. The device is simple: a transparent [[two-liter bottle]] is filled with water plus a little bleach to inhibit [[algae|algal growth]] and fitted into a hole in a roof. The device functions like a [[deck prism]]: during [[daytime]] the water inside the bottle refracts sunlight, delivering about as much light as a 40–60 watt [[incandescent bulb]] to the interior. A properly installed solar bottle can last up to 5 years.&lt;ref name="Inhabitat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/mit-students-install-10000-revolutionary-solar-bottle-lamps-in-manila-slums/ |title=10,000 Dirt Cheap and Life-Altering Plastic Lamps Installed in Manila Slums &amp;#124; Inhabitat - Sustainable Design Innovation, Eco Architecture, Green Building |publisher=Inhabitat |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/video/2011/07/11/bringing-light-to-the-poor-one-liter-at?videoId=216968892 |title=Bringing light to the poor, one liter at a time &amp;#124; Video &amp;#124; Reuters.com |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The use of plastic bottles in this way to provide indoor lighting from daylight was developed by [[Alfredo Moser]] of Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23536914 BBC News article about Alfredo Moser and his invention]&lt;/ref&gt; Using the technology as a social enterprise was first launched in the Philippines by Illac Diaz under the My Shelter Foundation in April 2011.&lt;ref name="riomatters.wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riomatters.wordpress.com/2012/06/06/1-liter-of-light-by-ami-valdemoro/ |title=A Liter of Light Goes a Long Way (by Ami Valdemoro) &amp;#124; Harvard Students Talk Rio+20 |publisher=Riomatters.wordpress.com |date=2012-06-06 |accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to help the idea to grow sustainably, Diaz implemented a “local entrepreneur” business model whereby bottle bulbs are assembled and installed by local people, who can earn a small income for their work. Within months, one carpenter and one set of tools in one community in San Pedro, Laguna, expanded the organization to 15,000 solar bottle bulb installations in 20 cities and provinces around the Philippines, and began to inspire local initiatives around the world.&lt;ref name="A Litre of Light"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/secretariat/momentum_for_change/items/6638.php |title=A Litre of Light |publisher=Unfccc.int |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; MyShelter Foundation also established a training center that conducts workshops with youth, business companies, and other groups who are interested in volunteering their time to build lights in their communities.

In less than a year since inception, over 200,000 bottle bulbs were installed in communities around the world. Liter of Light has a goal to light up 1 million homes by the end of 2015.&lt;ref name="inhabitat.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/a-liter-of-light-aims-to-illuminate-1-million-homes-with-plastic-solar-bottle-bulbs/ |title="A Liter of Light" Aims to Illuminate 1 Million Homes With Plastic Solar Bottle Bulbs &amp;#124; Inhabitat - Sustainable Design Innovation, Eco Architecture, Green Building |publisher=Inhabitat |date=2012-03-23 |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===About the MyShelter Foundation===
MyShelter Foundation was established by Illac Diaz in 2006 to create a system of sustainability and reliability through its capability-building and employment-generating projects.&lt;ref name="A Litre of Light"/&gt; Based on the concepts of social enterprise, appropriate low-cost technologies, and alternative construction in the Philippines, MyShelter Foundation has pioneered projects such as the Pier One Seafarer’s Dormitory, the Design Against the Elements (DAtE) competition, and the Bottle School Project.

The Solar Bottle Bulb, as it has also been called,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Kotoe Oshima |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-08-30/world/eco.philippines.bottle_1_plastic-bottles-bulbs-slums?_s=PM:WORLD |title=Plastic bottles light up lives - CNN |publisher=Articles.cnn.com |date=2011-08-30 |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; is installed in the roof of homes with the purpose of refracting sunlight in order to light up a room. The project’s innovation lies in its utilization of cheap, durable and readily available materials to produce high quality natural lighting enabling the urban poor to have access to an affordable, environmentally friendly long-term alternative to electric light for use during the day.

Most of the plastic bottles used are recycled 1.5 liter bottles.  After being filled with water and a little bleach, the bottle is pushed through a steel sheet that serves as a metal lock to prevent it from slipping.  It is then embedded into a corrugated iron roof. A small part of the bottle is left outside while the rest of it protrudes into the house.  Sealant is put around the hole made in the roof to keep it weather proof. The refractive properties of water ensures that the light from the sun that reaches the inside of the bottle becomes omni-directional mimicking an electric light bulb and emitting the same amount of light as a 40–60&amp;nbsp;W incandescent bulb depending on the amount of solar [[insolation]] available.  Adding bleach to the water prevents it from turning green with algae and ensures a high quality light keeping the water clear for a longer time. In order to facilitate use of the invention through open source mechanisms, step-by-step guides on materials and installation are available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYTIYUUK70I |title=How to Build a Solar Bottle Bulb 2.0 ( Updated English Version) |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-09-03 |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Glue ===

Using an appropriate durable, leak-proof, space-filling glue, that does not melt because of the sun, is one of the main challenges for the solution. Many local groups are experimenting with different glues to find the best solution for both costs and quality. It was usually found that [[silicone]]-based or [[polyurethane]] glues work best.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The inventor, Alfredo Moser, used a [[polyester resin]].&lt;ref&gt;

Lights Foundation, an youth social venture founded by local community worker Shanjidul Alam Seban Shaan working on bottle light project in [[Chittagong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hifipublic.com/2015/05/13/how-to-bottle-light-light-up-your-house-for-free/ |title=Feature: Bottle Light: Light Up Your House For Free! |publisher=hifipublic.com |date=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They made the local version of bottle light named 'Botol Bati' which costs around 2-2.5 USD and sustains for 4–5 years. Their R&amp;D department working on the local night version of bottle light which can light up remote areas like [[Sundarbans]], [[Cox's Bazar]] [[Kutubdia Upazila]], [[Khagrachari District]] etc. where electricity is not available sufficiently, which will cost less than 6 dollars to make and will sustain for 4–5 years. They aim to spread the awareness about bottle light to the remote areas by training the local school students. Around 44.80% of Bangladeshi people have no access to electricity, around 24% of the total population are slum dwellers where people use illegal electricity, millions of people live in hilltract areas, where electricity is not available sufficiently; Lights Foundation's aim is to serve those people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/article/527239/%E0%A6%85%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%A7%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%A6%E0%A7%82%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%87-%E2%80%98%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%B2-%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%BF%E2%80%99 |title=অন্ধকার দূর করতে ‘বোতল বাতি’ |publisher=prothom-alo.com |date=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lights Foundation became the country partner of Liter of Light by launching Liter of Light Bangladesh officially, and Shanjidul Alam Seban Shaan became the Executive Director. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://suprobhat.com/%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%87%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%B8-%E0%A6%AB%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%89%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%A1%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B6%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A5%E0%A7%87-%E0%A6%B2/|title=লাইটস ফাউন্ডেশনের সাথে লিটার অব লাইট যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের চুক্তিস্বাক্ষর - Suprobhat Bangladesh|website=suprobhat.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liter of Light Bangladesh started spreading the idea in New York and other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.prothomalo.com/technology/article/1463916/%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%B9%E0%A6%9C%E0%A7%87-%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%BF-%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%88%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%87-%E2%80%98%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%85%E0%A6%AC-%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%87%E0%A6%9F%E2%80%99|title=সহজে বাতি তৈরিতে ‘লিটার অব লাইট’|work=প্রথম আলো|access-date=2018-04-29|language=bn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.banglanews24.com/national/news/bd/646096.details|title=লিটার অব লাইট বাংলাদেশের অনুষ্ঠান নিউইয়র্কে|last=BanglaNews24.com|work=banglanews24.com|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.manobkantha.com/%E0%A6%9A%E0%A6%9F%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%97%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%AE%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%85%E0%A6%AB-%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%87/|title=চট্টগ্রামের লিটার অফ লাইটের অনুষ্ঠান নিউ ইয়র্কে - Daily Manobkantha|website=www.manobkantha.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.observerbd.com/details.php?id=132423|title=Giving the Gift of Light hosted in New York - Young Observer - observerbd.com|work=The Daily Observer|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebangladeshpost.com/education/25741|title=‘Liter of Light BD’ hosts event in New York|website=The Bangladesh Post|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.kalerkantho.com/online/national/2018/04/04/8880|title=Liter of Light Bangladesh hosts ‘Giving the Gift of Light’ in New York {{!}} Kaler Kantho|last=Kantho|first=Kaler|work=Kaler Kantho|access-date=2018-04-29|language=bn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/bytes/tech-happening/liter-light-bangladesh-hosts-introductory-event-new-york-1558480|title=Liter of Light Bangladesh hosts an introductory event in New York|date=2018-04-05|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/bytes/tech-happening/liter-light-bangladesh-hosts-introductory-event-new-york-1558480|title=Liter of Light Bangladesh hosts an introductory event in New York|date=2018-04-05|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China===
Liter Of Light China was created by three passionate international students from China in 2016, and the first project in [[Rudong]] will be conducted in the early summer, 2017.

=== Colombia ===
The movement in Colombia was started by Camilo Herrera in a small town called [[Duitama]] in the [[Boyaca Department]], approximately 200 kilometers from [[Bogota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unlitrodeluzcolombia.org/ |title=Fundacion Un Litro De Luz Colombia &amp;#124; Inicio |publisher=Unlitrodeluzcolombia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04

=== Dominican Republic ===
Liter of Light was started up in the Dominican Republic by the German volunteer Nicolai Rapp in 2015 who then distributed the project with other German and local volunteers in over 7 provinces. 
They achieved the installation of bottle and solar nightlights in more than 250 houses with global fundraising. In the focus of their movement are the rural areas without or with limited access to electricity. 
They also presented the idea of Liter of Light to several local NGO´s in seminars and workshops to reach all the off-grid communities of the country. Recently, their efforts also focused on bringing 
the project to Haiti, where around 75% of the population has to live without access to electricity.

=== Egypt ===
A group of seven students from the French University in Egypt (UFE) have begun Liter of Light locally in the context of a social and environmental development project.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
In November 2014, PepsiCo announced that they will implement Liter of Light in 3 villages in upper Egypt, with two partners : SunUtions Company for solar solutions and Masr ElKheir organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=بالصور..

=== France ===
In 2015, Liter of Light France was created. The French branch is developing an important link between pedagogical project in Europe and the international cooperation around the world. The NGO wants in Europe to make the new generation aware of the energy poverty reality and show that they can have, with a small activity, a huge social and environmental impact. The NGO wants, as well, to deliver the message to developing countries that a new generation all around the world are caring about the World Citizenship. During International cooperation, Liter of Light France is underlining the main philosophies of the movement as technological innovation accessible to everybody, capacity building, and initiatives South-South. The movement in France was started by Olivier Lasbouygues, Paola Sierra and Isabel Rico.

Inspired by the project of Isang Litrong Liwanag, Liter of Light was introduced to the people of India by Pradeep Chanti.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrL3mXcBPtM |title=A Liter Of Light India |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first trial was done in Vikarabad, a rural village in Telangana in 2011. This bulb was successfully installed and is still working. With this experience, the team gradually expanded the concept. Later, Mr. Ranjeet Gakhare, an alumnus of Indian Institute of Technology Bombay and Mr. Chaitanya Reddy from Cornell University joined Pradeep and expanded the concept to all over India. With the generous help of several NGOs and various organizations, awareness, campaigns and workshops were conducted in various cities like Hyderabad, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Jalpaiguri, Delhi, etc. Starting with the one bottle in Vikarabad, the team is not only installing several models in houses of the unprivileged, but also mentoring various other organizations, NGOs, student bodies and the people in need. The demonstration of Liter of Light was conducted at TEDxChristUniversity in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1CAtS2zm-4 |title= Wealth from waste: Illac Diaz at TEDxChristUniversity |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 it was carried out by Desire Foundation, Bhubaneswar on the coruscating day of Diwali to celebrate the festival of light in a unique style with the underprivileged.

Liter of Light India was nominated for Change Maker's Award by Uttarakhand Sustainable Development Festival and for 'Young Achiever's Award' by prestigious society magazine. 

Liter of Light India also takes initiatives like Woman Empowerment, City Cleanliness and Education.

=== Kenya ===
A youth group called Koch Hope has started to install 2L PET bottles in the Korogocho slums.&lt;ref name="dailyherald"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20111124/news/711249857/ |title=Plastic bottle, water help light Kenyan slums |publisher=DailyHerald.com |date=2011-11-24 |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first the people were skeptical that the bottle installations would let in water, so the first bottles were installed in a local school as a test. The locals thus bought into the idea and the first 100 bulbs were installed in April 2011 for free in hopes to attract interest and donors. Next, the local initiative would like to expand to other areas around Nairobi.&lt;ref name="dailyherald" /&gt;

=== Malaysia ===
[http://www.theincitement.com/our-work/liter-of-light Liter of Light Malaysia] ran its first project in June, 2015, and is run by a Malaysia-based social business called [http://www.theincitement.com Incitement], founded by Zikry Kholil and Daniel de Gruijter, which runs several social initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theincitement.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Liter of Light Malaysia has thus far completed 36 projects, predominantly for marginalized communities in Pahang, Malaysia and the Orang Asli communities living in Cameron Highlands, but also in Sabah and Sarawak in East Malaysia (Borneo). After Incitement launched Liter of Light Malaysia, it has also pushed Liter of Light into the Italian market under the umbrella of Incitement Italy. To date, Liter of Light Malaysia has installed 1850+ solar powered lamps in the rural areas of Malaysia, effectively providing light at night for more than 6,000 underprivileged Malaysians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theincitement.com/projects/liter-of-light/|title=Join Liter of Light Malaysia to Eradicate Energy Poverty|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico ===
Liter of Light began in Mexico in early 2013, sponsored by Qohélet A.C.&lt;ref&gt;http://literoflight.wix.com/mexico#!about/cipy&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by Tere Gonzalez, who had previously worked with Liter of Light in India &amp; Spain, the group began operations with a pilot program in the state of Chihuahua México, where they were able to benefit 114 people. As of September 2013, they are working to complete the next phase of installations in Ajusco, Mexico City, to benefit a further 500 families.&lt;ref&gt;https://egresados.itesm.mx/egresados/plsql/NoticiasPortalOr.NPO_Inicio?l_noticia=3504&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nepal ===
(PROJECT UJYALO) “Ujyalo” means “the light” in Nepali. Ujyalo is one of the initiatives started by Ujyalo Foundation&lt;ref&gt;http://ujyaloinnepal.wordpress.com/&lt;/ref&gt; in Nepal.

Ujyalo creates lighting systems by using wasted plastic bottles that amplify a little amount of solar light with the help of water by refracting it into various directions to light up a room. Ujyalo is inspired by “A Liter of Light” initiative.

This natural bulb aims to create an environmental friendly, energy efficient and cost effective system that can be used to light up homes in Nepal that either do not have access to electricity or cannot afford it. Moreover, this will not only help provide light, but will also help us recycle wasted plastic bottles from the community.

Furthermore, given that major cities in Nepal, like Kathmandu, have to endure almost 20 hours of load shedding in the winter on a daily basis, this project has the potential and need in both rural and urban Nepal.

===Netherlands===
Liter of Light Netherlands aims at realizing projects in suitable countries with the purpose of establishing a local Liter of Light sub-organization and its work is threefold. Prior to the project, the work focuses mainly on gathering information, preparing the projects, promoting and fundraising. During the projects abroad, the project focuses on spreading the idea and inspiring people to get involved with Liter of Light and even starting their own project. Therefore, empowering the partner organization is a major goal and includes holding bottle-building workshops on site and setting up an operational framework. After the project, the partner organizations will be assisted and continuously supported by Liter of Light Netherlands.

=== Pakistan ===
A partnership has been created with Ace Welfare Foundation, Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acewelfare.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt; According to both of the organizations objectives, and considering the situation that more than 11% of the Pakistani population lives without access to the electricity of which 70% of the individuals live in the rural areas in 50,000 villages that are completely detached from the national grid,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reffra.com/blogs/14157/11134/life-s-fine-tunes-at-work&lt;/ref&gt; it has been mutually decided to form a partnership in order to implement A LITER OF LIGHT project in the territory of PAKISTAN, under the representation of ACE WELFARE FOUNDATION, founded by Mr. Vaqas Attaullah Butt.

[[File:Aufnahme der magnetischen Struktur eines Magnetstreifens auf eine EC-Karte (Aufnahme mit CMOS-MagView)2.jpg|thumb|Visualization of magnetically stored information on a magnetic stripe card (Recorded with CMOS-MagView)]]

A '''magnetic stripe card''' is a type of card capable of [[Magnetic storage|storing data]] by modifying the [[magnetism]] of tiny iron-based magnetic particles on a band of magnetic material on the card. The magnetic stripe, sometimes called '''swipe card''' or '''magstripe''', is read by swiping past a [[Tape head|magnetic reading head]]. Magnetic stripe cards are commonly used in [[credit card]]s, [[identity card]]s, and transportation tickets. They may also contain an [[RFID|RFID tag]], a [[transponder|transponder device]] and/or a [[integrated circuit|microchip]] mostly used for business premises [[access control]] or electronic payment.

Magnetic recording on steel tape and wire was invented in Denmark around 1900 for recording audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/recording.technology.history/magnetic4.html|title=AES Historical Committee|author=|date=|website=www.aes.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, magnetic recording of digital computer data on plastic tape coated with iron oxide was invented. In 1960, [[IBM]] used the magnetic tape idea to develop a reliable way of securing magnetic stripes to plastic cards,&lt;ref name="svigals"&gt;Jerome Svigals, The long life and imminent death of the mag-stripe card, IEEE Spectrum, June 2012, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; under a contract with the US government for a security system. A number of [[International Organization for Standardization]] standards, [[ISO/IEC 7810]], [[ISO/IEC 7811]], [[ISO/IEC 7812]], [[ISO/IEC 7813]], [[ISO 8583]], and [[ISO/IEC 4909]], now define the physical properties of the card, including size, flexibility, location of the magstripe, magnetic characteristics, and data formats. They also provide the standards for financial cards, including the allocation of card number ranges to different card issuing institutions.

==History==
[[File:Magnetic stripe prototype.jpg|thumb|The first prototype of magnetic stripe card created by IBM in the late 1960s. A stripe of cellophane magnetic tape is fixed to a piece of cardboard with clear adhesive tape]]
Magnetic storage was known from World War II and computer data storage in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="svigals" /&gt;

In 1969 [[Forrest Parry]], an IBM engineer, had the idea of securing a piece of magnetic tape, the predominant storage medium at the time, to a plastic card base. He became frustrated because every adhesive he tried produced unacceptable results.  The tape strip either warped or its characteristics were affected by the adhesive, rendering the tape strip unusable. After a frustrating day in the laboratory, trying to get the right adhesive, he came home with several pieces of magnetic tape and several plastic cards. As he walked in the door at home, his wife Dorothea was ironing clothing. When he explained the source of his frustration: inability to get the tape to "stick" to the plastic in a way that would work, she suggested that he use the iron to melt the stripe on. He tried it and it worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm100/us/en/icons/magnetic/|title=IBM100 - Click on "View all icons".

==First magnetic striped plastic credit and badge access cards==

[[File:5. Back of first mag striped encoded paper card.JPG|thumbnail|Back of early magnetic striped encoded paper card. The narrow magnetic stripe in the center of the card was applied using a magnetic slurry paint.]]
The major development of the magnetic striped plastic card began in 1969 at the IBM Information Records Division (IRD) headquartered in Dayton N.J. In 1970, the marketing organization was transferred by IBM DPD back to the Information Records Division in order to begin sales and marketing strategies for the magnetically striped and encoded cards being developed.&lt;ref name="03.ibm.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/dpd50/dpd50_chronology4.html |title=IBM Archives: DPD chronology - page 4 |publisher=03.ibm.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took almost two years for IBM IRD engineers to not only develop the process for reliably applying the magnetic stripe to plastic cards via a hot stamping method, but also develop the process for encoding the magnetic stripe utilizing the IBM Delta Distance C Optical Bar Code format.&lt;ref name="NYTimes2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/magazine/who-made-that-universal-product-code.html?_r=0|title=Who Made That Universal Product Code|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IBM UPC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/upc/ |title=IBM100 - UPC |publisher=03.ibm.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This engineering effort resulted in IBM IRD producing the first magnetic striped plastic credit and ID cards used by banks, insurance companies, hospitals and many others. Another result of this project was that IBM IRD and IBM Data Processing Division announced on February 24, 1971 the first Magnetic Credit Card Service Center and the IBM 2730-1 Transaction Validation Terminal.&lt;ref name="03.ibm.com"/&gt;
Arthur E. Hahn Jr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njit.edu/news/2010/2010-220.php] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907122149/http://www.njit.edu/news/2010/2010-220.php |date=September 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was hired by IBM IRD in Dayton, N.J. on Aug 12, 1969 to head up this engineering effort. Other members of the group were David Morgan (Manager), Billy House (Software Developer), William Creeden (Programmer), and E. J. Gillen (Mechanical Engineering/Machining).{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} They were given a recently announced IBM 360 Model 30 computer with 50k of RAM for control of the encoding/embossing of the Magnetic Stripe Cards.&lt;ref name="IBM system360"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/system360/ |title=IBM100 - System 360 |publisher=03.ibm.com |date=1964-04-07 |accessdate=2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IBM 360 computer was for scientific/business applications so the IRD engineers first had to convert the 360 into a "process control computer" and then develop software and hardware around it. Due to the limited RAM, the software was developed in 360 Assembler Language. This conversion enabled the 360 computer to monitor and control the entire production process the IRD engineers designed and built. The engineering design/build effort was carried out in a raised floor secured area of IBM IRD in Dayton, N.J. which was built specifically for the project. This tightly secured area with limited access was required because of the sensitivity of the data that would ultimately be used to encode and emboss the credit and ID cards.

==Bar code encoding developments==
The IRD engineers first had to develop a reliable process of hot stamping the magnetic stripe to the plastic cards. This was necessary in order to meet the close tolerances required to reliably encode and read the data on the Magnetic Stripe Cards by magnetic write/read heads. The magnetic stripe was encoded with a single track of data utilizing the IBM Delta Distance C Optical Bar Code format.&lt;ref name="NYTimes2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IBM UPC"/&gt; The Delta Distance C Optical Bar Code was developed by the IBM Systems Development Division working at Research Triangle Park in Raleigh North Carolina headed up by George J. Laurer. Other members of the group were N. Joseph Woodland, Paul McEnroe, Dr. Robert Evans, Bernard Silver, Art Hamburgen, Heard Baumeister and Bill Crouse.&lt;ref name="NYTimes2013"/&gt; The IBM group in Raleigh was competing with RCA, Litton-Zellweger and other companies  who  were working with the National Retail Merchants Association NRMA to develop a standard optical bar code to be used in the retail industry. NRMA wanted an optically readable code that could be printed on products allowing purchasers to rapidly "check out" at the new electronic cash register/checkout counters being developed. The code would also be used for production and inventory control of products. Of the many optical bar codes submitted to NRMA by IBM and other companies, NRMA finally selected the later version of the IBM bar code known as the Delta Distance D Optical Bar Code format. The Delta Distance C Code was an earlier version of the [[Universal Product Code]] (UPC). The UPC code was selected in 1973 by NRMA as their standard and has become the World Wide Standard that we all know today as the UPC Uniform Product Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idhistory.com/ |title=Retail Identification History Museum History of the UPC |publisher=Idhistory.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
In 1971, after the IBM IRD engineers completed the development and building phase of the project they began in 1969, they released the equipment to the IRD manufacturing group in Dayton N.J. to begin producing the plastic magnetic striped credit and ID cards. Because of the sensitivity of the customer data and the security requirements of banks, insurance companies and others, the manufacturing group decided to leave the entire line in the secured area where it was developed.

Banks, insurance companies, hospitals etc., supplied IBM IRD with "raw plastic cards" preprinted with their logos, contact information etc. They also supplied the data information which was to be encoded and embossed on the cards. This data was supplied to IRD on large 0.5 inch wide, 10.5 inch diameter IBM Magnetic Tape Reels which was the standard for computers at that time.&lt;ref name="IBM system360"/&gt;
The manufacturing process started by first applying the magnetic stripe to the preprinted plastic cards via the hot stamping process developed by the IBM IRD engineers.  This operation of applying the magnetic stripe to the plastic cards was done off line in another area of IBM IRD and not in the secured area. The cards were then brought into the secured area and placed in "hoppers" at the beginning of the production line.
The tape reels containing the data were then installed on the modified IBM 360 computer prior to beginning the encoding, embossing and verification of the cards. After the 360 performed a check to verify that all systems and stations were loaded and ready to go, the computer began feeding the Magnetic Striped Plastic Cards from the hoppers at the front end of the production line down a motorized track. The entire operation was fully automated and controlled by the modified IBM 360 business computer. The line consisted of the following stations and operations:

# Plastic card feeder station: The cards were fed down a track in single file from card hoppers.
# Magnetic write/read encoding station: The IBM 360 computer sent over the data which was encoded on the magnetic stripe utilizing the IBM Delta Distance C Optical Bar Code format. The card passed under the read head and the encoded data was sent back to the 360 for verification.
# An embossing station: The IRD engineers purchased and modified a Data Card Corp embossing machine and interfaced it with the IBM 360 computer to emboss the cards.&lt;ref name="IBM system360"/&gt;  The original design concept called for an Addressograph-Multigraph embossing machine, however, the IRD engineers quickly switched to a Data Card Corp embossing machine.  Data Card Corp, a Minneapolis/St. Paul company, had just developed the first electronically controlled embossing machine for plastic cards and effectively obsoleted all other mechanical operated embossers.
# A topping station: To highlight the embossing.
# An imprinter station: To imprint the embossing on an automatically fed paper roll.
# An optical reader station: To read the embossed information off the paper roll and feed it back to the 360 computer for verification.
# A one card rejection station: If either the encoding or embossing data on the card was not verified by the 360 computer, that one card was rejected. If both the encoded and embossed data was confirmed by the 360 computer, the card proceeded down the line.
# A mailer station: A mailer was printed with the name and address of the card holder along with the date and other relevant card information. These mailers were also preprinted and die cut by IRD according to the customers specs and logo requirements and were fed into the line out of boxes in a continuous fan feed method.
# A card insertion station: Here the card was automatically inserted onto the mailer.
# A bursting and folding station: Here the mailers were burst apart and then folded into a 3 fold packet that would fit into a business size envelope.
# An envelope printer/insertion station: Here an envelope was printed with the name and address of the customer and the mailer containing the card was automatically inserted into the envelope and sealed.

This completed the manufacturing line for the magnetic striped encoded and embossed plastic credit and badge access cards. The envelopes were then taken to be posted and mailed directly to the customers of the companies who had ordered the cards from IRD.

What this small engineering group at IBM IRD and the IBM Bar Code development group in Raleigh accomplished in developing the first magnetic stripe credit and ID cards cannot be overstated. They laid the foundation for the entire magnetic stripe card industry that we know and use today through our use of credit cards, ATM cards, ID cards, hotel room and access cards, transportation tickets, and all the terminals and card readers that read the cards and enter the data into computers. Their developments resulted in every person having the ability to easily carry a card that connects them directly to computers with all the ramifications thereof.

Neither IBM nor anyone else applied for or received any patents pertaining to the magnetic stripe card, the delta-distance barcodes or even the Uniform Product Code (UPC). IBM felt that with an open architecture, it would enhance the growth of the media thereby resulting in more IBM computers and associated hardware being sold.
As with all new technologies, the magnetic stripe card developed and produced by IBM IRD with one track of encoded data using the Delta Distance C Bar Code format was quickly obsolete. Because of the electronic ATM/reservation/check out/and access systems that were rapidly developing, the banks, airlines and other industries required more encoded data. A wider magnetic stripe enabling multiple tracks of encoding along with new encoding standards was required.

The first US Patents for the ATM were granted in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|3685690}}, "Credit card automatic currency dispenser"; Thomas Barnes, George Chastain, and Marion Karecki; issued August 22, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; and 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|3761682}}, "Credit card automatic currency dispenser"; Thomas Barnes, George Chastain, and Don Wetzel; issued September 25, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

Other groups within IBM and other companies continued on with expanding the work done by this small group of engineers at IBM IRD, however, the contributions that these IBM IRD engineers made to the development of the magnetic stripe card is analogous to the Wright Brothers' contribution to the airline industry of today.

==Further developments and encoding standards==
There were a number of steps required to convert the magnetic striped media into an industry acceptable device. These steps included:
# Creating the international standards for stripe record content, including which information, in what format, and using which defining codes.
# Field testing the proposed device and standards for market acceptance.
# Developing the manufacturing steps needed to mass-produce the large number of cards required.
# Adding stripe issue and acceptance capabilities to available equipment.
These steps were initially managed by Jerome Svigals of the Advanced Systems Division of IBM, [[Los Gatos, California]] from 1966 to 1975.

In most magnetic stripe cards, the magnetic stripe is contained in a plastic-like film. The magnetic stripe is located 0.223&amp;nbsp;inches (5.66&amp;nbsp;mm) from the edge of the card, and is 0.375&amp;nbsp;inches (9.52&amp;nbsp;mm) wide. The magnetic stripe contains three tracks, each 0.110&amp;nbsp;inches (2.79&amp;nbsp;mm) wide. Tracks one and three are typically recorded at 210 bits per inch (8.27 bits per mm), while track two typically has a recording density of 75 bits per inch (2.95 bits per mm). Each track can either contain 7-bit alphanumeric characters, or 5-bit numeric characters. Track 1 standards were created by the [[International Air Transport Association|airlines industry (IATA)]]. Track 2 standards were created by the [[American Bankers Association|banking industry (ABA)]]. Track 3 standards were created by the thrift-savings industry.

Magstripes following these specifications can typically be read by most [[Point of sale|point-of-sale]] hardware, which are simply general-purpose computers that can be programmed to perform specific tasks. Examples of cards adhering to these standards include [[ATM card]]s, [[wikt:bank card|bank card]]s (credit and debit cards including [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] and [[MasterCard]]), [[gift card]]s, [[loyalty card]]s, [[driver's license]]s, [[telephone card]]s, [[membership card]]s, electronic benefit transfer cards (e.g. [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamp]]s), and nearly any application in which value or secure information is ''not'' stored on the card itself. Many video game and amusement centers now use debit card systems based on magnetic stripe cards.

Magnetic stripe cloning can be detected by the implementation of magnetic card reader heads and firmware that can read a signature of magnetic noise permanently embedded in all magnetic stripes during the card production process. This signature can be used in conjunction with common two-factor authentication schemes utilized in ATM, debit/retail point-of-sale and prepaid card applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magneprint.com/ |title=Welcome to MagnePrint®: What is MagnePrint? |publisher=Magneprint.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Counterexamples of cards which intentionally ignore ISO standards include hotel key cards, most subway and bus cards, and some national prepaid calling cards (such as for the country of [[Cyprus]]) in which the balance is stored and maintained directly on the stripe and not retrieved from a remote database.

==Magnetic stripe coercivity==
[[File:Aufnahme der magnetischen Struktur eines Magnetstreifens auf eine EC-Karte (Aufnahme mit CMOS-MagView).jpg|thumb|Detailed visualization of magnetically stored information on a magnetic stripe card (recorded with CMOS-MagView).]]
Magstripes come in two main varieties: high-[[coercivity]] (HiCo) at 4000 [[Oersted|Oe]] and low-coercivity (LoCo) at 300 [[Oersted|Oe]], but it is not infrequent to have intermediate values at 2750 Oe. High-coercivity magstripes require higher amount of magnetic energy to encode, and therefore are harder to erase. HiCo stripes are appropriate for cards that are frequently used, such as a credit card. Other card uses include time and attendance tracking, access control, library cards, employee ID cards and gift cards. Low-coercivity magstripes require a lower amount of magnetic energy to record, and hence the card writers are much cheaper than machines which are capable of recording high-coercivity magstripes. However, LoCo cards are much easier to erase and have a shorter lifespan. Typical LoCo applications include hotel room keys, time and attendance tracking, bus/transit tickets and season passes for theme parks. A card reader can read either type of magstripe, and a high-coercivity card writer may write both high and low-coercivity cards (most have two settings, but writing a LoCo card in HiCo may sometimes work), while a low-coercivity card writer may write only low-coercivity cards.

In practical terms, usually low coercivity magnetic stripes are a light brown color, and high coercivity stripes are nearly black; exceptions include a proprietary silver-colored formulation on transparent [[American Express]] cards. High coercivity stripes are resistant to damage from most magnets likely to be owned by consumers. Low coercivity stripes are easily damaged by even a brief contact with a magnetic purse strap or fastener. Because of this, virtually all bank cards today are encoded on high coercivity stripes despite a slightly higher per-unit cost.

Magnetic stripe cards are used in very high volumes in the mass transit sector, replacing paper based tickets with either a directly applied magnetic [[slurry]] or hot foil stripe. Slurry applied stripes are generally less expensive to produce and are less resilient but are suitable for cards meant to be disposed after a few uses.

==Financial cards==
{{Main article|ISO/IEC 7813}}
There are up to three tracks on magnetic cards known as tracks 1, 2, and 3. Track 3 is virtually unused by the major worldwide networks {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}, and often isn't even physically present on the card by virtue of a narrower magnetic stripe. Point-of-sale card readers almost always read track 1, or track 2, and sometimes both, in case one track is unreadable. The minimum cardholder account information needed to complete a transaction is present on both tracks. Track 1 has a higher bit density (210 bits per inch vs. 75), is the only track that may contain alphabetic text, and hence is the only track that contains the cardholder's name.

Track 1 is written with code known as [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]
[[DEC SIXBIT|SIXBIT]] plus odd [[parity bit|parity]]. The information on track 1 on financial cards is contained in several formats: '''A''', which is reserved for proprietary use of the card issuer, '''B''', which is described below, '''C-M''', which are reserved for use by ANSI Subcommittee X3B10 and '''N-Z''', which are available for use by individual card issuers:

=== Track 1 ===

'''Format B:'''

*'''Start sentinel'''&amp;nbsp;— one character (generally '%')
*'''Format code="B"'''&amp;nbsp;— one character (alpha only)
*'''Primary account number''' (PAN)&amp;nbsp;— up to 19 characters. Usually, but not always, matches the [[credit card number]] printed on the front of the card.
*'''Field Separator'''&amp;nbsp;— one character (generally '^')
*'''Name'''&amp;nbsp;— 2 to 26 characters
*'''Field Separator'''&amp;nbsp;— one character (generally '^')
*'''Expiration date'''&amp;nbsp;— four characters in the form YYMM.
*'''Service code'''&amp;nbsp;— three characters
*'''Discretionary data'''&amp;nbsp;— may include Pin Verification Key Indicator (PVKI, 1 character), PIN Verification Value (PVV, 4 characters), [[Card Verification Value#CVC / CVV|Card Verification Value or Card Verification Code]] (CVV or CVC, 3 characters)
*'''End sentinel'''&amp;nbsp;— one character (generally '?')
*'''Longitudinal redundancy check''' ([[Longitudinal redundancy check|LRC]])&amp;nbsp;— it is one character and a validity character calculated from other data on the track.

=== Track 2 ===
This format was developed by the banking industry (ABA). This track is written with a 5-bit scheme (4 data bits + 1 parity), which allows for sixteen possible characters, which are the numbers 0-9, plus the six characters &lt;code&gt; : ; &lt; = &gt; ?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;. The selection of six punctuation symbols may seem odd, but in fact the sixteen codes simply map to the [[ASCII]] range 0x30 through 0x3f, which defines ten digit characters plus those six symbols.  The data format is as follows:

*'''Start sentinel'''&amp;nbsp;— one character (generally ';')
*'''Primary account number''' (PAN)&amp;nbsp;— up to 19 characters. Usually, but not always, matches the [[credit card number]] printed on the front of the card.
*'''Separator'''&amp;nbsp;— one char (generally '=')
*'''Expiration date'''&amp;nbsp;— four characters in the form YYMM.
*'''Service code'''&amp;nbsp;— three digits. The first digit specifies the interchange rules, the second specifies authorization processing and the third specifies the range of services
*'''Discretionary data'''&amp;nbsp;— as in track one
*'''End sentinel'''&amp;nbsp;— one character (generally '?')
*'''Longitudinal redundancy check''' ([[Longitudinal redundancy check|LRC]])&amp;nbsp;— it is one character and a validity character calculated from other data on the track.  Most reader devices do not return this value when the card is swiped to the presentation layer, and use it only to verify the input internally to the reader.

'''Service code''' values common in financial cards:

First digit
:1: International interchange OK
:2: International interchange, use [[EMV|IC (chip)]] where feasible
:5: National interchange only except under bilateral agreement
:6: National interchange only except under bilateral agreement, use IC (chip) where feasible
:7: No interchange except under bilateral agreement (closed loop)
:9: Test

Second digit
:0: Normal
:2: Contact issuer via online means
:4: Contact issuer via online means except under bilateral agreement

Third digit
:0: No restrictions, PIN required
:1: No restrictions
:2: Goods and services only (no cash)
:3: ATM only, PIN required
:4: Cash only
:5: Goods and services only (no cash), PIN required
:6: No restrictions, use PIN where feasible
:7: Goods and services only (no cash), use PIN where feasible

==United States and Canada driver's licenses==
The data stored on magnetic stripes on American and Canadian driver's licenses is specified by the [[American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators]]. Not all states and provinces use a magnetic stripe on their driver's licenses. For a list of those that do, see the AAMVA list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aamva.org/ID-Security-Technologies/ |title=ID Security Technologies |publisher=AAMVA |date= |accessdate=2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aamva.org/KnowledgeCenter/DLIDStandards/IDSecurityTechnologies/licensetechnology-canadian.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202235104/http://www.aamva.org/KnowledgeCenter/DLIDStandards/IDSecurityTechnologies/licensetechnology-canadian.htm |date=December 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: Each state has a different selection of information they encode, not all states are the same.
Note: Some states, such as Texas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/TN/htm/TN.521.htm#521.126 |title=Texas statutes, section 521.126, restricting use of electronically readable information from driver's licenses or personal identification certificates |publisher=Texas Legislature Online, State of Texas |date=June 2015 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; have laws restricting the access and use of electronically readable information encoded on driver's licenses or identification cards under certain circumstances.

==Other card types==
[[Smart card]]s are a newer generation of card that contain an [[integrated circuit]]. Some smart cards have metal contacts to electrically connect the card to the [[Dip reader|reader]], and [[contactless smart card|contactless cards]] use a magnetic field or radio frequency ([[RFID]]) for proximity reading.

Hybrid smart cards include a magnetic stripe in addition to the chip&amp;nbsp;— this is most commonly found in a [[payment card]], so that the cards are also compatible with payment terminals that do not include a smart card reader.

Cards with all three features: magnetic stripe, smart card chip, and RFID chip are also becoming common as more activities require the use of such cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/2042258 |title=ID Card Supply Now Offers Triple-Secure ID Cards With Magnetic Strip, RFID and Smart Chip - Press Release |publisher=Digital Journal |date=2014-07-09 |accessdate=2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vulnerabilities ==

=== DEF CON 24 ===
During [[DEF CON]] 24, Weston Hecker presented ''Hacking Hotel Keys, and Point Of Sales Systems.'' In the talk, Hecker described the way magnetic strip cards function and utilised spoofing software,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://samy.pl/magspoof/|title=Samy Kamkar: MagSpoof - credit card/magstripe spoofer|website=samy.pl|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Arduino]] to obtain administrative access from hotel keys, via service staff walking past him. Hecker claims he used  administrative keys from POS systems on other systems, effectively providing access to any system with a magnetic stripe reader, providing access to run privileged commands.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

'''Medical ultrasound''' (also known as '''diagnostic sonography''' or '''ultrasonography''') is a [[medical imaging|diagnostic imaging]] technique based on the application of [[ultrasound]]. It is used to see internal body structures such as [[tendons]], [[muscles]], joints, blood vessels, and internal organs. Its aim is often to find a source of a disease or to exclude any [[pathology]]. The practice of examining [[pregnant]] women using ultrasound is called [[Obstetric ultrasonography|obstetric ultrasound]], and is widely used.

[[Ultrasound]] is [[sound wave]]s with [[frequency|frequencies]] which are higher than those audible to humans (&gt;20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz). Ultrasonic images, also known as sonograms, are made by sending pulses of ultrasound into [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] using a [[ultrasound transducer|probe]]. The sound [[echo]]es off the tissue; with different tissues reflecting varying degrees of sound. These echoes are recorded and displayed as an image to the operator.

Many different types of images can be formed using sonographic instruments. The most well-known type is a B-mode image, which displays the acoustic impedance of a two-dimensional cross-section of tissue. Other types of image can display [[Doppler ultrasound|blood flow]], motion of tissue over time, the location of blood, the presence of specific molecules, the [[elastography|stiffness of tissue]], or the [[3D ultrasound|anatomy of a three-dimensional region]].

Compared to other prominent methods of medical imaging, ultrasound has several advantages. It provides images in real-time, it is portable and can be brought to the bedside, it is substantially lower in cost, and it does not use harmful [[ionizing radiation]]. Drawbacks of ultrasonography include various limits on its field of view, such as the need for patient cooperation, dependence on physique, difficulty imaging structures behind [[bone]] and air, and the necessity of a skilled operator, usually a trained professional.

==By organ or system==
Sonography (ultrasonography) is widely used in [[medicine]]. It is possible to perform both [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] and [[Therapeutic ultrasound|therapeutic procedures]], using ultrasound to guide interventional procedures (for instance [[biopsy|biopsies]] or drainage of fluid collections). [[Sonographer]]s are medical professionals who perform scans which are then typically interpreted by themselves or the radiologists, physicians who specialize in the application and interpretation of a wide variety of medical imaging modalities, or by cardiologists in the case of cardiac ultrasonography (echocardiography). Sonographers typically use a hand-held probe (called a transducer) that is placed directly on and moved over the patient. Increasingly, clinicians (physicians and other healthcare professionals who provide direct patient care) are using ultrasound in their office and hospital practices.

Sonography is effective for imaging soft tissues of the body. Superficial structures such as [[muscle]]s, [[tendon]]s, [[testes]], [[breast]], [[thyroid]] and parathyroid glands, and the [[neonatal]] brain are imaged at a higher [[frequency]] (7–18&amp;nbsp;MHz), which provides better axial and lateral [[Angular resolution|resolution]]. Deeper structures such as liver and kidney are imaged at a lower frequency 1–6&amp;nbsp;MHz with lower axial and lateral resolution but greater penetration.

A general-purpose ultrasound scanner may be used for most imaging purposes. Usually specialty applications may be served only by use of a specialty transducer. Most ultrasound procedures are done using a transducer on the surface of the body, but improved diagnostic confidence is often possible if a transducer can be placed inside the body. For this purpose, specialty transducers, including endovaginal, endorectal, and [[Transesophageal echocardiogram|transesophageal]] transducers are commonly employed. At the extreme of this, very small transducers can be mounted on small diameter catheters and placed into blood vessels to image the walls and disease of those vessels.

=== Anesthesiology===
In [[anesthesiology]], Ultrasound is commonly used by anesthesiologists to guide injecting needles when placing local anaesthetic solutions near [[Nerve|nerves]]. It is also used for gaining vascular access such as central venous [[cannulation]] and difficult [[arterial cannulation]]. [[Transcranial Doppler]] is frequently used by neuro-anesthesiologists for obtaining information about flow-velocity in the basal [[Cerebral circulation|cerebral vessels]].

===Angiology (vascular)===
[[Image:IVUS of CAD (1).png|right|thumb|Intravascular ultrasound image of a coronary artery (left), with color-coding on the right, delineating the lumen (yellow), external elastic membrane (blue) and the atherosclerotic plaque burden (green).]]
{{See|Doppler ultrasonography|Intravascular ultrasound}}
In [[angiology]] or [[vascular]] medicine, [[duplex  ultrasound]]  (B Mode vessels imaging combined with Doppler flow measurement) is daily used to diagnose arterial and venous disease all over the body. This is particularly important in [[neurology]], where ultrasound is used for assessing blood flow and stenoses in the carotid arteries ([[Carotid ultrasonography]]) and the big intracerebral arteries ([[Transcranial Doppler]]).

[[Intravascular ultrasound]] (''IVUS'') is a methodology using a specially designed [[catheter]] with a miniaturized [[ultrasound]] probe attached to the distal end of the catheter.  The proximal end of the [[catheter]] is attached to computerized [[ultrasound]] equipment. It allows the application of [[ultrasound]] technology, such as [[piezoelectric transducer]] or [[Capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers|CMUT]], to see from inside [[blood vessel]]s out through the surrounding [[blood]] column, visualizing the [[endothelium]] (inner wall) of [[blood vessel]]s in living individuals.&lt;ref name="pmid21327914"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garcìa-Garcìa HM, Gogas BD, Serruys PW, Bruining N | title = IVUS-based imaging modalities for tissue characterization: similarities and differences | journal = Int J Cardiovasc Imaging | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 215–24 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21327914 | pmc = 3078312 | doi = 10.1007/s10554-010-9789-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the legs, [[ultrasonography of deep venous thrombosis]] focuses on the [[deep vein]]s, while [[ultrasonography of chronic venous insufficiency of the legs]] focuses on more [[Superficial vein|superficial veins.]]

===Cardiology (heart)===
{{Main|Echocardiography}}
[[Echocardiography]] is an essential tool in [[cardiology]], to diagnose e.g. [[Dilated cardiomyopathy|dilatation of parts of the heart]] and function of [[heart ventricles]] and valves

===Emergency medicine===
{{Main|Emergency ultrasound}}
[[Point-of-care ultrasound|Point of care]] [[emergency ultrasound]] has many applications in [[emergency medicine]], including the [[Focused assessment with sonography for trauma|Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exam]] for assessing significant [[hemoperitoneum]] or [[pericardial tamponade]] after [[Physical trauma|trauma]]. Ultrasound can be used for many other applications in the Emergency Department including evaluation for [[Gallstone|gallstones]], [[Kidney Stones|kidney stones]], [[Pulmonary edema|fluid in the lungs]] or [[Reflex bradycardia|decreased cardiac output]].

===[[Gastroenterology]]/[[Large intestine|Colorectal]] surgery===
{{See|Abdominal ultrasonography|Endoanal ultrasound}}

[[Abdominal ultrasonography|Abdominal]] and [[endoanal ultrasound]] are frequently used in [[gastroenterology]] and [[colorectal surgery]]. In abdominal sonography, the solid organs of the abdomen such as the [[pancreas]], [[aorta]], [[inferior vena cava]], [[liver]], [[gall bladder]], [[bile duct]]s, [[kidney]]s, and [[spleen]] are imaged. Sound waves are blocked by gas in the [[Gastrointestinal tract|bowel]] and attenuated in different degree by fat, therefore there are limited diagnostic capabilities in this area. The [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] can sometimes be seen when inflamed (as in e.g.: [[appendicitis]]). [[Endoanal ultrasound]] is used particularly in the investigation of anorectal symptoms such as [[fecal incontinence]] or [[obstructed defecation]]. It images the immediate [[perianal]] anatomy and is able to detect occult defects such as tearing of the [[Anal sphincterotomy|anal sphincter]]. [[Ultrasonography of liver tumors]] allows for both detection and characterization.&lt;ref name="BadeaIoanitescu2012"&gt;Content originally copied from: {{Cite book|last1=Badea|first1=R.|title=Liver Tumors|last2=Ioanitescu|first2=Simona|year=2012|doi=10.5772/31137|isbn=978-953-51-0036-2}}, [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ (CC BY 3.0)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|gynecologic ultrasonography|Obstetric ultrasonography}}
[[Gynecologic ultrasonography]] examines female pelvic organs (specifically the [[uterus]], the [[ovaries]], and the [[Fallopian tubes]]) as well as the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], the [[Adnexa of uterus|adnexa]], and the [[Pouch of Douglas]]. It commonly uses [[vaginal ultrasonography]]. 

[[Obstetrical ultrasonography|Obstetrical sonography]] is commonly used during [[pregnancy]] to check on the development of the [[fetus]]. It can be used to identify many conditions that would be harmful to the mother and the baby, many health care professionals consider the risk of leaving these conditions undiagnosed to be much greater than the very small risk, if any, associated with undergoing an ultrasound scan. 

Even where [[sonography]] is used routinely in obstetric appointments during pregnancy, authorities discourage its use for non-medical purposes such as fetal "keepsake" videos and photos.&lt;ref name=keepsake&gt;{{cite web|title=Avoid Fetal "Keepsake" Images, Heartbeat Monitors|url=https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm095508.htm|website=U.S. food and Drug Administration|publisher=U.S. Government|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obstetric ultrasound is primarily used to:

*Date the pregnancy ([[gestational age]])
*Confirm fetal viability
*Determine location of [[fetus]], intrauterine vs [[Ectopic pregnancy|ectopic]]
*Check the location of the placenta in relation to the cervix
*Check for the number of fetuses ([[multiple pregnancy]])
*Check for major physical abnormalities.
*Assess fetal growth (for evidence of [[intrauterine growth restriction]] ([[IUGR]]))
*Check for fetal movement and heartbeat.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ultrasonic examinations should only be performed by competent personnel who are trained and updated in safety matters. Ultrasound produces heating, pressure changes and mechanical disturbances in tissue. Diagnostic levels of ultrasound can produce temperature rises that are hazardous to sensitive organs and the embryo/fetus. Biological effects of non-thermal origin have been reported in animals but, to date, no such effects have been demonstrated in humans, except when a microbubble [[contrast agent]] is present.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Nonetheless, care should be taken to use low power settings and avoid pulsed wave scanning of the fetal brain unless specifically indicated in high risk pregnancies.

Ultrasound scanners have different [[Doppler sonography|Doppler]]-techniques to visualize arteries and veins. The most common is colour doppler or power doppler, but also other techniques like b-flow are used to show bloodflow in an organ. By using pulsed wave doppler or continuous wave doppler bloodflow velocities can be calculated.

Figures released for the period 2005–2006 by the UK Government (Department of Health) show that non-obstetric ultrasound examinations constituted more than 65% of the total number of ultrasound scans conducted.

===Hemodynamics (blood circulation)===
Blood velocity can be measured in various blood vessels, such as [[middle cerebral artery]] or [[descending aorta]], by relatively inexpensive and low risk ultrasound Doppler probes attached to portable monitors&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uscom.com.au/products/uscom1a/applications/&lt;/ref&gt;. These provides non-invasive or transcutaneous (non-piecing) minimal invasive blood flow assessment. Common examples are, [[Transcranial Doppler]], [[Esophogeal_doppler|Esophogeal Doppler]] and Suprasternal Doppler.

===Otolaryngology (head and neck)===
[[File:Neck ultrasound.jpg|thumb|Neck ultrasound.]]
Most structures of the neck, including the [[thyroid]] and [[Parathyroid gland|parathryoid glands]], [[lymph nodes]], and [[salivary glands]], are well-visualized by high-frequency ultrasound with exceptional anatomic detail. Ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality for thyroid tumors and lesions, and ultrasonography is critical in the evaluation, preoperative planning, and postoperative surveillance of patients with [[thyroid cancer]]. Many other benign and malignant conditions in the head and neck can be evaluated and managed with the help of diagnostic ultrasound and ultrasound-guided procedures.

===Neonatology===
In [[neonatology]], [[transcranial Doppler]] can be used for basic assessment of intracerebral structural abnormalities, bleeds, [[ventriculomegaly]] or [[hydrocephalus]] and anoxic insults ([[Periventricular leukomalacia]]). The ultrasound can be performed through the soft spots in the skull of a newborn infant ([[Fontanelle]]) until these completely close at about 1 year of age and form a virtually impenetrable acoustic barrier for the ultrasound. The most common site for [[cranial ultrasound]] is the anterior fontanelle. The smaller the fontanelle, the poorer the quality of the picture.

===Ophthalmology ({{visible anchor|eyes}})===
In [[ophthalmology]] and [[optometry]], there are two major forms of eye exam using ultrasound:
*[[A-scan ultrasound biometry]], commonly referred to as an ''A-scan'' (short for ''Amplitude scan''). It is an [[#Modes|A-mode]] that provides data on the length of the [[human eye|eye]], which is a major determinant in [[list of eye diseases and disorders|common sight disorders]].
*''B-scan ultrasonography'', or ''B-scan'', which is a [[#Modes|B-mode]] scan that produces a cross-sectional view of the [[human eye|eye]] and the [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]]. It is commonly used to see inside the eye when media is hazy due to cataract or any corneal opacity.

===Pulmonology (lungs)===
In [[pulmonology]], endobronchial Ultrasound (EBUS) probes are applied to standard flexible endoscopic probes and used by pulmonologists to allow for direct visualization of endobronchial lesions and lymph nodes prior to transbronchial needle aspiration.  Among its many uses, EBUS aids in lung cancer staging by allowing for lymph node sampling without the need for major surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/thx.2005.047829 |title=Real-time endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial needle aspiration for sampling mediastinal lymph nodes |year=2006 |last1=Herth |first1=F J F |last2=Eberhardt |first2=R |last3=Vilmann |first3=P |last4=Krasnik |first4=M |last5=Ernst |first5=A |journal=Thorax |volume=61 |issue=9 |pages=795–8 |pmid=16738038 |pmc=2117082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urology (urinary)===
[[File:UltrasoundBPH.jpg|thumb|right|[[Urinary bladder]] (black butterfly-like shape) and hyperplastic [[prostate]] ([[Benign prostatic hyperplasia|BPH]]) visualized by medical sonographic technique]]

Ultrasound is routinely used in [[urology]] to determine, for example, the amount of fluid retained in a patient's bladder. In a pelvic sonogram, organs of the pelvic region are imaged. This includes the [[uterus]] and [[ovary|ovaries]] or [[urinary bladder]]. Males are sometimes given a pelvic sonogram to check on the health of their bladder, the [[prostate]], or their [[testicles]] (for example to distinguish [[epididymitis]] from [[testicular torsion]]). In young males, it is used to distinguish more benign testicular masses ([[varicocele]] or [[hydrocele]]) from [[testicular cancer]], which is highly curable but which must be treated to preserve health and fertility. There are two methods of performing a pelvic sonography – externally or internally. The internal pelvic sonogram is performed either trans[[vagina]]lly (in a woman) or transrectally (in a man). Sonographic imaging of the pelvic floor can produce important diagnostic information regarding the precise relationship of abnormal structures with other pelvic organs and it represents a useful hint to treat patients with symptoms related to pelvic prolapse, double incontinence and obstructed defecation. It is used to diagnose and, at higher frequencies, to treat (break up) kidney stones or kidney crystals ([[nephrolithiasis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.pelviperineology.org/practical/sonography_female_pelvic_floor_clinical_indications_and_techniques.html |title=Sonography of the female pelvic floor:clinical indications and techniques |first1=Vittorio Luigi |last1=Piloni |first2=Liana |last2=Spazzafumo |journal=Pelviperineology |volume=26 |issue=2 |date=June 2007 |pages=59–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nephrology (kidneys)===
{{Main|Renal ultrasonography}}
In [[nephrology]], ultrasonography of the kidneys is essential in the diagnosis and management of kidney-related diseases. The kidneys are easily examined, and most pathological changes in the kidneys are distinguishable with ultrasound. US is an accessible, versatile, inexpensive, and fast aid for decision-making in patients with renal symptoms and for guidance in renal intervention.&lt;ref name=Hansen2015&gt;Content initially copied from: {{cite journal|last1=Hansen|first1=Kristoffer|last2=Nielsen|first2=Michael|last3=Ewertsen|first3=Caroline|title=Ultrasonography of the Kidney: A Pictorial Review|journal=Diagnostics|volume=6|issue=1|year=2015|pages=2|issn=2075-4418|doi=10.3390/diagnostics6010002|pmid=26838799|pmc=4808817}} [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ (CC-BY 4.0)]&lt;/ref&gt; Renal ultrasound (US) is a common examination, which has been performed for decades. Using [[B-mode imaging]], assessment of renal anatomy is easily performed, and US is often used as image guidance for renal interventions. Furthermore, novel applications in renal US have been introduced with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), elastography and fusion imaging. However, renal US has certain limitations, and other modalities, such as CT and MRI, should always be considered as supplementary imaging modalities in the assessment of renal disease.&lt;ref name=Hansen2015/&gt;

== From sound to image ==
The creation of an image from sound is done in three steps – producing a [[sound wave]], receiving [[Echo (phenomenon)|echoes]], and interpreting those echoes.

=== Producing a sound wave ===
[[File:AlokaPhoto2006a.jpg|thumb|right|Medical ultrasound scanner]]

A sound wave is typically produced by a [[piezoelectric]] [[Ultrasonic sensor|transducer]] encased in a plastic housing. Strong, short electrical pulses from the ultrasound machine drive the transducer at the desired frequency. The [[frequencies]] can be anywhere between 1 and 18 [[Megahertz|MHz]], though frequencies up to 50–100 megahertz have been used experimentally in a technique known as biomicroscopy in special regions, such as the anterior chamber of the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pavlin |first1=Charles |last2=Foster |first2=F. Stuart |year=1994 |title=Ultrasound Biomicroscopy of the Eye |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-94206-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older technology transducers focused their beam with physical lenses. Newer technology transducers use [[phased array]] techniques to enable the ultrasound machine to change the direction and depth of focus.

The sound is focused either by the shape of the transducer, a lens in front of the transducer, or a complex set of control pulses from the ultrasound scanner, in the ([[beamforming]]) technique. This focusing produces an arc-shaped sound wave from the face of the transducer. The wave travels into the body and comes into focus at a desired depth.

Materials on the face of the transducer enable the sound to be transmitted efficiently into the body (often a rubbery coating, a form of [[impedance matching]]). In addition, a water-based gel is placed between the patient's skin and the probe.

The sound wave is partially reflected from the layers between different tissues or scattered from smaller structures. Specifically, sound is reflected anywhere where there are acoustic impedance changes in the body: e.g. [[blood cell]]s in [[blood plasma]], small structures in organs, etc. Some of the reflections return to the transducer.

=== Receiving the echoes ===
The return of the sound wave to the transducer results in the same process as sending the sound wave, except in reverse. The returned sound wave vibrates the transducer and the transducer turns the vibrations into electrical pulses that travel to the ultrasonic scanner where they are processed and transformed into a digital image.

=== Forming the image ===
To make an image, the ultrasound scanner must determine two things from each received echo:
# How long it took the echo to be received from when the sound was transmitted.
# How strong the echo was.

Once the ultrasonic scanner determines these two things, it can locate which pixel in the image to light up and to what intensity.

Transforming the received signal into a digital image may be explained by using a blank spreadsheet as an analogy. First picture a long, flat transducer at the top of the sheet. Send pulses down the 'columns' of the spreadsheet (A, B, C, etc.). Listen at each column for any return echoes. When an echo is heard, note how long it took for the echo to return. The longer the wait, the deeper the row (1,2,3, etc.). The strength of the echo determines the brightness setting for that cell (white for a strong echo, black for a weak echo, and varying shades of grey for everything in between.) When all the echoes are recorded on the sheet, we have a greyscale image.

=== Displaying the image ===
Images from the ultrasound scanner are transferred and displayed using the [[DICOM]] standard.  Normally, very little post processing is applied to ultrasound images.

== Sound in the body ==
[[File:UltrasoundProbe2006a.jpg|thumb|right|Linear array transducer]]
Ultrasonography ([[sonography]]) uses a probe containing multiple acoustic [[transducer]]s to send pulses of sound into a material. Whenever a sound wave encounters a material with a different density (acoustical impedance), part of the sound wave is reflected back to the probe and is detected as an echo. The time it takes for the [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]] to travel back to the probe is measured and used to calculate the depth of the tissue interface causing the echo. The greater the difference between acoustic impedances, the larger the echo is. If the pulse hits gases or solids, the density difference is so great that most of the acoustic energy is reflected and it becomes impossible to see deeper.

The frequencies used for medical imaging are generally in the range of 1 to 18&amp;nbsp;MHz. Higher frequencies have a correspondingly smaller wavelength, and can be used to make sonograms with smaller details. However, the attenuation of the sound wave is increased at higher frequencies, so in order to have better penetration of deeper tissues, a lower frequency (3–5&amp;nbsp;MHz) is used.

Seeing deep into the body with sonography is very difficult. Some acoustic energy is lost every time an echo is formed, but most of it (approximately &lt;math&gt;\textstyle 0.5 \frac{\mbox{dB}}{\mbox{cm depth}\cdot\mbox{MHz}}&lt;/math&gt;) is lost from acoustic absorption. (See also [[Acoustic attenuation]] for further details on modeling of acoustic attenuation and absorption.)

The speed of sound varies as it travels through different materials, and is dependent on the [[Acoustic impedance|acoustical impedance]] of the material. However, the sonographic instrument assumes that the acoustic velocity is constant at 1540&amp;nbsp;m/s. An effect of this assumption is that in a real body with non-uniform tissues, the beam becomes somewhat de-focused and image resolution is reduced.

To generate a [[2D computer graphics|2D]]-image, the ultrasonic beam is swept. A transducer may be swept mechanically by rotating or swinging. Or a 1D [[phased array]] transducer may be used to sweep the beam electronically. The received data is processed and used to construct the image. The image is then a 2D representation of the slice into the body.

[[3D computer graphics|3D]] images can be generated by acquiring a series of adjacent 2D images. Commonly a specialised probe that mechanically scans a conventional 2D-image transducer is used. However, since the mechanical scanning is slow, it is difficult to make 3D images of moving tissues. Recently, 2D phased array transducers that can sweep the beam in 3D have been developed. These can image faster and can even be used to make live 3D images of a beating heart.

[[Doppler effect|Doppler]] ultrasonography is used to study blood flow and muscle motion. The different detected speeds are represented in color for ease of interpretation, for example leaky heart valves: the leak shows up as a flash of unique color. Colors may alternatively be used to represent the amplitudes of the received echoes.

==Modes==&lt;!--Several article link here. Insert {{Anchor|Modes}} if changing the header--&gt;
Several modes of ultrasound are used in medical imaging.&lt;ref&gt;The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine, 2nd Edition, Vol. 1 A-B. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobbold 422"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cobbold, Richard S. C. |title=Foundations of Biomedical Ultrasound|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hwb5D60vb5IC&amp;pg=PA422|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-516831-0|pages=422–423}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are:
*'''A-mode''': A-mode (amplitude mode) is the simplest type of ultrasound. A single transducer scans a line through the body with the echoes plotted on screen as a function of depth. [[Therapeutic ultrasound]] aimed at a specific tumor or calculus is also A-mode, to allow for pinpoint accurate focus of the destructive wave energy.&lt;ref name="pmid23408755"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carovac A, Smajlovic F, Junuzovic D | title = Application of ultrasound in medicine | journal = Acta Inform Med | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 168–71 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 23408755 | pmc = 3564184 | doi = 10.5455/aim.2011.19.168-171 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''B-mode or 2D mode''': In B-mode (brightness mode) ultrasound, a linear array of transducers simultaneously scans a plane through the body that can be viewed as a two-dimensional image on screen. More commonly known as 2D mode now.
[[File:B-flow ultrasonography of venous reflux.jpg|thumb|B-flow image of [[chronic venous insufficiency|venous reflux]]. {{noprint|[[:File:B-flow ultrasonography of venous reflux.gif|Video is available]]}}]]
:*'''B-flow''' is a mode that digitally highlights weak flow reflectors (mainly [[red blood cell]]s) while suppressing the signals from the surrounding stationary tissue. It can visualize flowing blood and surrounding stationary tissues simultaneously.&lt;ref name="WangChou2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Hsin-Kai|last2=Chou|first2=Yi-Hong|last3=Chiou|first3=Hong-Jen|last4=Chiou|first4=See-Ying|last5=Chang|first5=Cheng-Yen|title=B-flow Ultrasonography of Peripheral Vascular Diseases|journal=Journal of Medical Ultrasound|volume=13|issue=4|year=2005|pages=186–195|issn=09296441|doi=10.1016/S0929-6441(09)60108-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus an alternative or complement to [[Doppler ultrasonography]] in visualizing blood flow.&lt;ref name="Wachsberg2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wachsberg|first1=Ronald H.|title=B-Flow Imaging of the Hepatic Vasculature: Correlation with Color Doppler Sonography|journal=American Journal of Roentgenology|volume=188|issue=6|year=2007|pages=W522–W533|issn=0361-803X|doi=10.2214/AJR.06.1161|pmid=17515342}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''C-mode''': A C-mode image is formed in a plane normal to a B-mode image. A gate that selects data from a specific depth from an A-mode line is used; then the transducer is moved in the 2D plane to sample the entire region at this fixed depth. When the transducer traverses the area in a spiral, an area of 100&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can be scanned in around 10 seconds.&lt;ref name="Cobbold 422"/&gt;
*'''M-mode''': In M-mode (motion mode) ultrasound, pulses are emitted in quick succession – each time, either an A-mode or B-mode image is taken. Over time, this is analogous to recording a [[video]] in ultrasound. As the organ boundaries that produce reflections move relative to the probe, this can be used to determine the velocity of specific organ structures.
*'''[[Doppler ultrasonography|Doppler mode]]''': This mode makes use of the Doppler effect in measuring and visualizing blood flow
**'''Color Doppler''': Velocity information is presented as a color-coded overlay on top of a B-mode image
**'''Continuous wave (CW) Doppler''': Doppler information is sampled along a line through the body, and all velocities detected at each time point are presented (on a time line)
**'''Pulsed wave (PW) Doppler''': Doppler information is sampled from only a small sample volume (defined in 2D image), and presented on a timeline
**'''[[Duplex ultrasonography|Duplex]]''': a common name for the simultaneous presentation of 2D and (usually) PW Doppler information. (Using modern ultrasound machines, color Doppler is almost always also used; hence the alternative name '''Triplex'''.)
*'''Pulse inversion mode''': In this mode, two successive pulses with opposite sign are emitted and then subtracted from each other. This implies that any linearly responding constituent will disappear while gases with non-linear compressibility stand out. Pulse inversion may also be used in a similar manner as in '''Harmonic mode'''; see below:
*'''Harmonic mode''': In this mode a deep penetrating fundamental frequency is emitted into the body and a [[Second-harmonic imaging microscopy|harmonic overtone]] is detected. This way noise and artifacts due to reverberation and aberration are greatly reduced. Some also believe that penetration depth can be gained with improved lateral resolution; however, this is not well documented.

==Expansions==
An additional expansion or additional technique of ultrasound is '''biplanar ultrasound''', in which the probe has two 2D planes that are perpendicular to each other, providing more efficient localization and detection.&lt;ref name=reves/&gt; Furthermore, an '''omniplane''' probe is one that can rotate 180° to obtain multiple images.&lt;ref name=reves&gt;Page 161 (part II &gt; Two-dimensional Echocardiography) in: {{cite book |author1=Reves, J.

[[Doppler ultrasonography]] employs the [[Doppler effect]] to assess whether structures (usually blood)&lt;ref name=" L'Investigation vasculaire par ultrasonographie doppler"&gt;{{cite book | author= Claude Franceschi | title=L'Investigation vasculaire par ultrasonographie doppler| publisher= Masson|year=1978 |isbn=978-2-225-63679-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; are moving towards or away from the probe, and its relative velocity. By calculating the frequency shift of a particular sample volume, for example flow in an artery or a jet of blood flow over a heart valve, its speed and direction can be determined and visualized. ''Color Doppler'' is the measurement of velocity by color scale. Color Doppler images are generally combined with grayscale ([[#Modes|B-mode]]) images to display ''duplex ultrasonography'' images. Uses include:
*[[Doppler echocardiography]], the use of Doppler ultrasonography to examine the [[heart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003869.htm|title=Echocardiogram|website=[[MedlinePlus]]|accessdate=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; An echocardiogram can, within certain limits, produce accurate assessment of the direction of [[blood flow]] and the [[velocity]] of blood and cardiac tissue at any arbitrary point using the Doppler effect. Velocity measurements allow assessment of [[cardiac valve]] areas and function, any abnormal communications between the left and right side of the heart, any leaking of blood through the valves ([[valvular regurgitation]]), calculation of the [[cardiac output]] and calculation of [[E/A ratio]]&lt;ref name=Mohamed&gt;[http://www.bioline.org.br/request?mj04008] Abdul Latif Mohamed, Jun Yong, Jamil Masiyati, Lee Lim, Sze Chec Tee.

A [[contrast media|contrast medium]] for medical ultrasonography is a formulation of encapsulated gaseous microbubbles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1540-8175.1999.tb00144.x |title=Characteristics of SonoVue™ |year=1999 |last1=Schneider |first1=Michel |journal=Echocardiography |volume=16 |pages=743–746 |pmid=11175217 |issue=7, Pt 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; to increase [[echogenicity]] of blood, discovered by Dr Raymond Gramiak in 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00004424-196809000-00011 |title=Echocardiography of the Aortic Root |year=1968 |last1=Gramiak |first1=Raymond |last2=Shah |first2=Pravin M. |journal=Investigative Radiology |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=356–66 |pmid=5688346}}&lt;/ref&gt; and named [[contrast-enhanced ultrasound]]. This contrast [[medical imaging]] modality is clinically used throughout the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icus-society.org/attachments/article/103/ICUS%20CEUS%20Use%20Around%20the%20World-2.pdf |title=CEUS Around the World – The International Contrast Ultrasound Society (ICUS) |date=October 2013 |accessdate=2013-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029213232/http://www.icus-society.org/attachments/article/103/ICUS%20CEUS%20Use%20Around%20the%20World-2.pdf |archivedate=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular for [[echocardiography]] in the United States and for [[ultrasound]] [[radiology]] in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].

Microbubbles-based contrast media is administrated [[intravenously]] in [[patient]] [[blood stream]] during the medical ultrasonography examination. Thanks to their size, the microbubbles remain confined in [[blood vessels]] without extravasating towards the [[interstitial fluid]]. An [[ultrasound]] contrast media is therefore purely intravascular, making it an ideal agent to image [[Biological system|organ]] microvascularization for [[Medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] purposes. A typical clinical use of contrast ultrasonography is detection of a [[hypervascular]] [[Metastasis|metastatic]] [[tumor]], which exhibits a contrast uptake (kinetics of microbubbles concentration in blood circulation) faster than healthy [[Tissue (biology)|biological tissue]] surrounding the tumor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2012.09.002 |title=Guidelines and Good Clinical Practice Recommendations for Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) in the Liver – Update 2012 |year=2013 |last1=Claudon |first1=Michel |last2=Dietrich |first2=Christoph F. |last3=Choi |first3=Byung Ihn |last4=Cosgrove |first4=David O. |last5=Kudo |first5=Masatoshi |last6=Nolsøe |first6=Christian P. |last7=Piscaglia |first7=Fabio |last8=Wilson |first8=Stephanie R. |last9=Barr |first9=Richard G. |last10=Chammas |first10=Maria C. |last11=Chaubal |first11=Nitin G. |last12=Chen |first12=Min-Hua |last13=Clevert |first13=Dirk Andre |last14=Correas |first14=Jean Michel |last15=Ding |first15=Hong |last16=Forsberg |first16=Flemming |last17=Fowlkes |first17=J.

[[File:Parametric Imaging of Vascular Signatures.jpg|thumb|Parametric imaging of vascular signatures (diagram)]]

In oncological practice of medical contrast ultrasonography, clinicians use the method of parametric imaging of vascular signatures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1716 |title=Parametric imaging for characterizing focal liver lesions in contrast-enhanced ultrasound |year=2010 |last1=Rognin |first1=N G |last2=Arditi |first2=M |last3=Mercier |first3=L |last4=Frinking |first4=P J A |last5=Schneider |first5=M |last6=Perrenoud |first6=G |last7=Anaye |first7=A |last8=Meuwly |first8=J |last9=Tranquart |first9=F |journal=IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics and Frequency Control |volume=57 |issue=11 |pages=2503–11 |pmid=21041137  }}&lt;/ref&gt; invented by Dr Nicolas Rognin in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parametric images based on dynamic behavior over time|url=http://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/WO2011026866|website= International Patent|publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) |vauthors=Rognin N, etal |pages=1–44|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is conceived as a [[cancer]] aided diagnostic tool, facilitating characterization of a suspicious [[tumor]] ([[Malignant tumor|malignant]] versus [[Benign tumor|benign]]) in an organ. This method is based on medical [[computational science]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1055/s-0032-1312894 |title=Perfusion Quantification in Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) – Ready for Research Projects and Routine Clinical Use |year=2012 |last1=Tranquart |first1=F. |last2=Mercier |first2=L. |last3=Frinking |first3=P. |last4=Gaud |first4=E. |last5=Arditi |first5=M. |journal=Ultraschall in der Medizin |volume=33 |pages=S31–8 |pmid=22723027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cag.2010.12.005 |title=Interactive visual analysis of contrast-enhanced ultrasound data based on small neighborhood statistics |year=2011 |last1=Angelelli |first1=Paolo |last2=Nylund |first2=Kim |last3=Gilja |first3=Odd Helge |last4=Hauser |first4=Helwig |journal=Computers &amp; Graphics |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=218–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; to analyze a time sequence of ultrasound contrast images, a digital video recorded in real-time during patient examination. Two consecutive [[signal processing]] steps are applied to each [[pixel]] of the tumor:
#calculation of a vascular signature (contrast uptake difference with respect to healthy tissue surrounding the tumor);
#automatic [[Pattern recognition|classification]] of the vascular signature into a unique [[parameter]], this last coded in one of the four following [[color]]s:
#*[[green]] for continuous hyper-enhancement (contrast uptake higher than healthy tissue one),
#*[[blue]] for continuous hypo-enhancement (contrast uptake lower than healthy tissue one),
#*[[red]] for fast hyper-enhancement (contrast uptake before healthy tissue one) or
#*[[yellow]] for fast hypo-enhancement (contrast uptake after healthy tissue one).

Once [[signal processing]] in each pixel completed, a color spatial map of the parameter is displayed on a [[computer monitor]], summarizing all [[vascular]] information of the tumor in a single image called parametric image (see last figure of press article &lt;ref&gt;Barnes E, [http://www.auntminnie.com/index.aspx?sec=ser&amp;sub=def&amp;pag=dis&amp;ItemID=91487 Contrast US processing tool shows malignant liver lesions], AuntMinnie.com, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; as clinical examples). This parametric image is interpreted by clinicians based on predominant colorization of the tumor: red indicates a suspicion of [[malignancy]] (risk of cancer), green or yellow – a high probability of [[benignity]]. In the first case (suspicion of [[malignant tumor]]), the clinician typically prescribes a biopsy to confirm the diagnostic or a [[CT scan]] examination as a second opinion. In the second case (quasi-certain of [[benign tumor]]), only a follow-up is needed with a contrast ultrasonography examination a few months later. The main clinical benefits are to avoid a systematic biopsy (risky invasive procedure) of benign tumors or a [[CT scan]] examination exposing the patient to [[X-ray]] radiation. The parametric imaging of vascular signatures method proved to be effective in humans for characterization of tumors in the liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1148/radiol.11101866 |title=Differentiation of Focal Liver Lesions: Usefulness of Parametric Imaging with Contrast-enhanced US |year=2011 |last1=Anaye |first1=A. |last2=Perrenoud |first2=G. |last3=Rognin |first3=N. |last4=Arditi |first4=M. |last5=Mercier |first5=L. |last6=Frinking |first6=P. |last7=Ruffieux |first7=C. |last8=Peetrons |first8=P. |last9=Meuli |first9=R. |last10=Meuwly |first10=J.-Y. |journal=Radiology |volume=261 |pages=300–10 |pmid=21746815 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[cancer screening]] context, this method might be potentially applicable to other organs such as [[Breast cancer|breast]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4048/jbc.2013.16.2.208 |title=Diagnostic Value of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Parametric Imaging in Breast Tumors |year=2013 |last1=Yuan |first1=Zhang |last2=Quan |first2=Jiang |last3=Yunxiao |first3=Zhang |last4=Jian |first4=Chen |last5=Zhu |first5=He |last6=Liping |first6=Gong |journal=Journal of Breast Cancer |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=208–13 |pmid=23843855 |pmc=3706868}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Prostate cancer|prostate]].

=== Molecular ultrasonography (ultrasound molecular imaging) ===
The future of contrast ultrasonography is in [[molecular imaging]] with potential clinical applications expected in [[cancer screening]] to detect [[malignant tumor]]s at their earliest stage of appearance. Molecular ultrasonography (or ultrasound molecular imaging) uses targeted microbubbles originally designed by Dr [[Alexander Klibanov (biologist)|Alexander Klibanov]] in 1997;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9240089 |year=1997|last1=Klibanov|first1=A.

As a result, a few minutes after their injection in blood circulation, the targeted microbubbles accumulate in the malignant tumor; facilitating its localization in a unique ultrasound contrast image. In 2013, the very first exploratory [[clinical trial]] in humans for [[prostate cancer]] was completed at [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]] by Dr Hessel Wijkstra.&lt;ref&gt;{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT01253213|BR55 in Prostate Cancer: an Exploratory Clinical Trial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In molecular ultrasonography, the technique of [[acoustic radiation force]] (also used for shear wave [[elastography]]) is applied in order to literally push the targeted microbubbles towards microvessels wall; firstly demonstrated by Dr Paul Dayton in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0301-5629(99)00062-9 |title=Acoustic radiation force in vivo: A mechanism to assist targeting of microbubbles |year=1999 |last1=Dayton |first1=Paul |last2=Klibanov |first2=Alexander |last3=Brandenburger |first3=Gary |last4=Ferrara |first4=Kathy |journal=Ultrasound in Medicine &amp; Biology |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=1195–1201 |pmid=10576262}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows maximization of binding to the malignant tumor; the targeted microbubbles being in more direct contact with cancerous biomolecules expressed at the inner surface of tumoral microvessels. At the stage of scientific [[preclinical]] research, the technique of acoustic radiation force was implemented as a prototype in clinical ultrasound systems and validated ''[[in vivo]]'' in 2D&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2012.03.018 |title=Effects of Acoustic Radiation Force on the Binding Efficiency of BR55, a VEGFR2-Specific Ultrasound Contrast Agent |year=2012 |last1=Frinking |first1=Peter J.A. |last2=Tardy |first2=Isabelle |last3=Théraulaz |first3=Martine |last4=Arditi |first4=Marcel |last5=Powers |first5=Jeffry |last6=Pochon |first6=Sibylle |last7=Tranquart |first7=François |journal=Ultrasound in Medicine &amp; Biology |volume=38 |issue=8 |pages=1460–9 |pmid=22579540}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 3D&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2011.12.005 |title=An In Vivo Validation of the Application of Acoustic Radiation Force to Enhance the Diagnostic Utility of Molecular Imaging Using 3-D Ultrasound |year=2012 |last1=Gessner |first1=Ryan C. |last2=Streeter |first2=Jason E. |last3=Kothadia |first3=Roshni |last4=Feingold |first4=Steven |last5=Dayton |first5=Paul A. |journal=Ultrasound in Medicine &amp; Biology |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=651–60 |pmid=22341052|pmc=3355521 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rognin N |title=Molecular Ultrasound Imaging Enhancement by Volumic Acoustic Radiation Force (VARF): Pre-clinical in vivo Validation in a Murine Tumor Model |journal=World Molecular Imaging Congress, Savannah, GA, USA |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2013 |url=http://wmis2013.omnibooksonline.com/data/papers/P380.htm |displayauthors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011213605/http://wmis2013.omnibooksonline.com/data/papers/P380.htm |archivedate=October 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; imaging modes.

=== Elastography (ultrasound elasticity imaging) ===
{{Main article|Elastography}}
Ultrasound is also used for elastography, which is a relatively new imaging modality that maps the elastic properties of soft tissue.&lt;ref name=Wells&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wells P. N.

Elastography is useful in medical diagnoses as it can discern healthy from unhealthy tissue for specific organs/growths. For example, cancerous tumors will often be harder than the surrounding tissue, and diseased livers are stiffer than healthy ones.&lt;ref name=Wells/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sarv/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ophir, J. |author2=Céspides, I. |author3=Ponnekanti, H. |author4=Li, X. |title=Elastography: A quantitative method for imaging the elasticity of biological tissues|journal=Ultrasonic Imaging|volume=13|issue=2|pages=111–34|doi=10.1016/0161-7346(91)90079-W|pmid=1858217|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Parker, K J |author2=Doyley, M M |author3=Rubens, D J |title=Corrigendum: Imaging the elastic properties of tissue: The 20 year perspective|journal=Physics in Medicine and Biology|volume=57|issue=16|pages=5359–5360|doi=10.1088/0031-9155/57/16/5359|year=2012|bibcode=2012PMB....57.5359P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many ultrasound elastography techniques.&lt;ref name=Sarv/&gt;

===Interventional ultrasonography===
Interventional ultrasonography involves [[biopsy]], emptying fluids, intrauterine [[Blood transfusion]] ([[Hemolytic disease of the newborn]]).
*[[Thyroid cyst]]s: The high frequency thyroid [[ultrasound]] (HFUS) can be used to treat several gland conditions. The recurrent thyroid cyst that was usually treated in the past with surgery, can be treated effectively by a new procedure called percutaneous ethanol injection, or PEI. With ultrasound guided placement of a 25 gauge needle within the cyst, and after evacuation of the cyst fluid, about 50% of the cyst volume is injected back into the cavity, under strict operator visualization of the needle tip. The procedure is 80% successful in reducing the cyst to minute size.
*Metastatic thyroid cancer neck lymph nodes: The other thyroid therapy use for HFUS is to treat metastatic thyroid cancer neck lymph nodes that occur in patients who either refuse surgery, or are no longer a candidate for surgery. Small amounts of ethanol are injected under ultrasound guided needle placement. A blood flow study is done prior to the injection, by power doppler. The blood flow can be destroyed and the node become inactive, although it may still be there. Power doppler visualized blood flow can be eradicated, and there may be a drop in the cancer blood marker test, [[thyroglobulin]], TG, as the node become non-functional. Another interventional use for HFUS is to mark a cancer node one hour prior to surgery to help locate the node cluster at the surgery. A minute amount of methylene dye is injected, under careful ultrasound guided placement of the needle on the anterior surface, but not in the node. The dye will be evident to the thyroid surgeon when he opens the neck. A similar localization procedure with methylene blue, can be done to locate parathyroid adenomas at surgery.

=== Compression ultrasonography ===
Compression ultrasonography is when the probe is pressed against the skin. This can bring the target structure closer to the probe, increasing spatial resolution of it. Comparison of the shape of the target structure before and after compression can aid in diagnosis.

It used in [[ultrasonography of deep venous thrombosis]], wherein absence of vein compressibility is a strong indicator of thrombosis.&lt;ref name="JAMA"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.316.7124.17 |title=Compression ultrasonography for diagnostic management of patients with clinically suspected deep vein thrombosis: Prospective cohort study |year=1998 |last1=Cogo |first1=A. |last2=Lensing |first2=A.

==Attributes==
As with all imaging modalities, ultrasonography has its list of positive and negative attributes.

===Strengths===
* It images [[muscle]], [[soft tissue]], and bone surfaces very well and is particularly useful for delineating the interfaces between solid and fluid-filled spaces.
* It renders "live" images, where the operator can dynamically select the most useful section for diagnosing and documenting changes, often enabling rapid diagnoses. Live images also allow for ultrasound-guided biopsies or injections, which can be cumbersome with other imaging modalities.
* It shows the structure of organs.
* It has no known long-term side effects and rarely causes any discomfort to the patient.
* Equipment is widely available and comparatively flexible.
* Small, easily carried scanners are available; examinations can be performed at the bedside.
* Relatively inexpensive compared to other modes of investigation, such as [[X-ray computed tomography|computed X-ray tomography]], [[Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry|DEXA]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]].
* [[Image resolution#Spatial resolution|Spatial resolution]] is better in high frequency ultrasound transducers than it is in most other imaging modalities.
* Through the use of an [[ultrasound research interface]], an ultrasound device can offer a relatively inexpensive, real-time, and flexible method for capturing data required for special research purposes for tissue characterization and development of new image processing techniques

=== Weaknesses ===
[[File:Aorta duplication artifact 131206105958250c.jpg|thumb|Double aort artifact in sonography due to difference in velocity of sound waves in muscle and fat.]]
* Sonographic devices have trouble penetrating [[bone]]. For example, sonography of the adult brain is currently very limited.
* Sonography performs very poorly when there is a gas between the transducer and the organ of interest, due to the extreme differences in [[acoustic impedance]]. For example, overlying gas in the gastrointestinal tract often makes ultrasound scanning of the [[pancreas]] difficult. Lung imaging however can be useful in demarcating pleural effusions, detecting [[heart failure]], and detecting pneumonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Llamas-Álvarez|first1=AM|last2=Tenza-Lozano|first2=EM|last3=Latour-Pérez|first3=J|title=Accuracy of Lung Ultrasonography in the Diagnosis of Pneumonia in Adults: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis|journal=Chest|date=February 2017|volume=151|issue=2|pages=374–382|pmid=27818332|doi=10.1016/j.chest.2016.10.039}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Even in the absence of bone or air, the depth penetration of ultrasound may be limited depending on the frequency of imaging. Consequently, there might be difficulties imaging structures deep in the body, especially in obese patients.
* Physique has a large influence on image quality. Image quality and accuracy of diagnosis is limited with obese patients, overlying subcutaneous fat attenuates the sound beam and a lower frequency transducer is required (with lower resolution)
* The method is operator-dependent. A high level of skill and experience is needed to acquire good-quality images and make accurate diagnoses.
* There is no scout image as there is with CT and MRI. Once an image has been acquired there is no exact way to tell which part of the body was imaged.

==Risks and side-effects==
Ultrasonography is generally considered safe imaging,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1148/radiology.173.2.2678243 |pmid=2678243 |year=1989 |last1=Merritt |first1=CR |title=Ultrasound safety: What are the issues? |volume=173 |issue=2 |pages=304–6 |journal=Radiology}}{{Dead link|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the World Health Organizations saying:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=WHO|title=Training in Diagnostic Ultrasound: essentials, principles and standards|page=2 | year=1998 | url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_875.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:"Diagnostic ultrasound is recognized as a safe, effective, and highly flexible imaging modality capable of providing clinically relevant information about most parts of the body in a rapid and cost-effective fashion".

Diagnostic ultrasound studies of the fetus are generally considered to be safe during pregnancy. This diagnostic procedure should be performed only when there is a valid medical indication, and the lowest possible ultrasonic exposure setting should be used to gain the necessary diagnostic information under the "as low as reasonably practicable" or [[ALARP]] principle.

However, medical ultrasonography should not be performed without a medical indication to perform it. To do otherwise would be to perform [[unnecessary health care]] to patients, which bring unwarranted costs and may lead to other testing. Overuse of ultrasonography is sometimes as routine as screening for deep vein thrombosis after orthopedic surgeries in patients who are not at heightened risk for having that condition.&lt;ref name="AAOSfive"&gt;{{Citation |author1 = American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons |author1-link = American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons |date = February 2013 |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-academy-of-orthopaedic-surgeons/ |accessdate = 19 May 2013}}, which cites

Similarly, although there is no evidence ultrasound could be harmful for the fetus, medical authorities typically strongly discourage the promotion, selling, or leasing of ultrasound equipment for making "keepsake fetal videos".&lt;ref name="keepsake"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lockwook|first1=Charles J.|title=Keepsake fetal ultrasounds (November 01, 2010)|url=http://contemporaryobgyn.modernmedicine.com/contemporary-obgyn/news/modernmedicine/modern-medicine-now/keepsake-fetal-ultrasounds?page=full|website=Modern Medicine Network|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies on the safety of ultrasound===
* A meta-analysis of several ultrasonography studies published in 2000 found no statistically significant harmful effects from ultrasonography, but mentioned that there was a lack of data on long-term substantive outcomes such as neurodevelopment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11070816 |year=2000 |last1=Bricker |first1=L |last2=Garcia |first2=J |last3=Henderson |first3=J |last4=Mugford |first4=M |last5=Neilson |first5=J |last6=Roberts |first6=T |last7=Martin |first7=MA |title=Ultrasound screening in pregnancy: A systematic review of the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and women's views |volume=4 |issue=16 |pages=i–vi, 1–193 |journal=Health Technology Assessment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==
Diagnostic and [[therapeutic ultrasound]] equipment is regulated in the USA by the [[Food and Drug Administration]], and worldwide by other national regulatory agencies. The FDA limits acoustic output using several metrics; generally, other agencies accept the FDA-established guidelines.

Currently, New Mexico, Oregon, and North Dakota are the only US states that regulate diagnostic medical sonographers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ardms.org/Discover-ARDMS/about-us/Pages/Legislation.aspx Legislation]. ardms.org&lt;/ref&gt; Certification examinations for sonographers are available in the US from three organizations: the [[American Registry for Diagnostic Medical Sonography]], [[Cardiovascular Credentialing International]] and the [[American Registry of Radiologic Technologists]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The primary regulated metrics are [[Mechanical Index]] (MI), a metric associated with the cavitation bio-effect, and Thermal Index (TI) a metric associated with the tissue heating bio-effect. The FDA requires that the machine not exceed established limits, which are reasonably conservative so as to maintain diagnostic ultrasound as a safe imaging modality. This requires [[Industry self-regulation|self-regulation]] on the part of the manufacturer in terms of the machine's calibration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://sonoworld.com/Client/Fetus/html/doppler/capitulos-html/chapter_02.htm |chapter=Safety of diagnostic ultrasound in fetal scanning|author=Deane, Collin|year=2002|title=Doppler in Obstetrics|editor1=Kypros Nicolaides |editor2=Giuseppe Rizzo |editor3=Kurt Hecker |editor4=Renato Ximenes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultrasound-based pre-natal care and sex screening technologies were launched in India in the 1980s. With concerns about its misuse for [[sex-selective abortion]], the Government of India passed the [[Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, 1994|Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques Act (PNDT)]] in 1994 to regulate legal and illegal uses of ultrasound equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jskvrc.gov.in/ipas/2.pdf MTP and PCPNDT Initiatives Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601012501/http://jskvrc.gov.in/ipas/2.pdf |date=2014-06-01 }} Government of India (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The law was further amended into the Pre-Conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) (PCPNDT) Act in 2004 to deter and punish prenatal sex screening and sex selective abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbhealth.gov.in/download/IMPLEMENTATION%20OF%20THE%20PCPNDT%20ACT%20IN%20INDIA.pdf IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PCPNDT ACT IN INDIA – Perspectives and Challenges].

==History==
After the French physicist [[Pierre Curie]]’s discovery of [[piezoelectricity]] in 1880, ultrasonic waves could be deliberately generated for industry. Thereafter, in 1940, the American acoustical physicist [[Floyd Firestone]] devised the first ultrasonic echo imaging device, the Supersonic Reflectoscope, to detect internal flaws in metal castings. In 1941, the Austrian neurologist Karl Theo Dussik was in collaboration with his brother, Friedreich, a physicist, likely, the first person to ultrasonically echo image the human body, outlining thereby the ventricles of a human brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2170493|author1=Siddharth, S.  |author2=Goyal, A.|title= The origin of echocardiography|journal= Texas Heart Institute Journal|volume= 34|issue= 4|pages= 431–438|year= 2007|pmid= 18172524}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levine, H.

Wild|John Wild]] (1914–2009) first used ultrasound to assess the thickness of bowel tissue as early as 1949; he has been described as the "father of medical ultrasound".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.b4428 |title=John Wild |year=2009 |last1=Watts |first1=G. |journal=BMJ |volume=339 |pages=b4428}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent advances in the field took place concurrently in several countries. But it was not until 1963 when Meyerdirk &amp; Wright launched production of the first commercial hand-held articulated arm compound contact B-mode scanner that ultrasound became generally available for medical use.

===France===
Léandre Pourcelot, who was a researcher and teacher at INSA (Institut National des Sciences Appliquées) Lyon copublished in 1965 a report at "Académie des sciences" « Effet Doppler et mesure du débit sanguin » (Doppler effect and measure of the blood flow), the basis of his design of a Doppler flow meter in 1967.

In his book "L'investigation vasculaire par ultrasonographie Doppler" (Ed Masson, 1977) &lt;ref name=" L'Investigation vasculaire par ultrasonographie doppler"/&gt; Dr [[Claude Franceschi]] laid down the Doppler Ultrasound  fundamentals of the hemodynamics semiotics, which are still in use in current Doppler arterial and venous Duplex Ultrasound investigations.

===Scotland===
Parallel developments in [[Glasgow]], Scotland by Professor [[Ian Donald]] and colleagues at the [[Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital]] (GRMH) led to the first diagnostic applications of the technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Q|Q29581634}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donald was an [[obstetrics|obstetrician]] with a self-confessed "childish interest in machines, electronic and otherwise", who, having treated the wife of one of the company's directors, was invited to visit the Research Department of boilermakers [[Doosan Babcock|Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] at [[Renfrew]], where he used their industrial ultrasound equipment to conduct experiments on various morbid anatomical specimens and assess their ultrasonic characteristics. Together with the medical physicist {{Ill|Thomas Brown (medical physicist)|lt=Tom Brown|WD=Q29642404|reasonator=1}}.&lt;ref name="LatU"&gt;{{cite book|title=Looking at the Unborn: Historical aspects of obstetric ultrasound|url=http://www.histmodbiomed.org/witsem/vol5|year=2000|publisher=[[History of Modern Biomedicine Research Group]]|isbn=978-1-84129-011-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fellow obstetrician Dr John MacVicar, Donald refined the equipment to enable differentiation of pathology in live volunteer patients. These findings were reported in ''[[The Lancet]]'' on 7 June 1958&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(58)91905-6 |title=Investigation of Abdominal Masses by Pulsed Ultrasound |year=1958 |last1=Donald |first1=Ian |last2=MacVicar |first2=J |last3=Brown |first3=T.G |journal=The Lancet |volume=271 |issue=7032 |pages=1188–95 |pmid=13550965}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "Investigation of Abdominal Masses by Pulsed Ultrasound" – possibly one of the most important papers ever published in the field of diagnostic [[medical imaging]].

At GRMH, Professor Donald and Dr James Willocks then refined their techniques to obstetric applications including fetal head measurement to assess the size and growth of the fetus. With the opening of the new Queen Mother's Hospital in [[Yorkhill]] in 1964, it became possible to improve these methods even further. Dr [[Stuart Campbell (Obstetrician and Gynaecologist)|Stuart Campbell]]'s pioneering work on [[fetal]] [[cephalometry]] led to it acquiring long-term status as the definitive method of study of foetal growth. As the technical quality of the scans was further developed, it soon became possible to study pregnancy from start to finish and diagnose its many complications such as multiple pregnancy, fetal abnormality and ''[[placenta praevia]]''. Diagnostic ultrasound has since been imported into practically every other area of medicine.

===Sweden===
Medical ultrasonography was used in 1953 at [[Lund University]] by [[cardiology|cardiologist]] [[Inge Edler]] and [[Gustav Ludwig Hertz]]'s son [[Carl Hellmuth Hertz]], who was then a graduate student at the University's department of [[nuclear physics]].

Edler had asked Hertz if it was possible to use [[radar]] to look into the body, but Hertz said this was impossible. However, he said, it might be possible to use ultrasonography. Hertz was familiar with using ultrasonic reflectoscopes of the American acoustical physicist [[Floyd Firestone]]'s invention for [[nondestructive testing|nondestructive materials testing]], and together Edler and Hertz developed the idea of using this method in medicine.

The first successful measurement of heart activity was made on October 29, 1953 using a device borrowed from the ship construction company [[Kockums]] in [[Malmö]]. On December 16 the same year, the method was used to generate an echo-encephalogram (ultrasonic probe of the [[brain]]). Edler and Hertz published their findings in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1475-097X.2004.00539.x |title=The Use of Ultrasonic Reflectoscope for the Continuous Recording of the Movements of Heart Walls |year=2004 |last1=Edler |first1=I. |last2=Hertz |first2=C. H. |journal=Clinical Physiology and Functional Imaging |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=118–36 |pmid=15165281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 1962, after about two years of work, Joseph Holmes, William Wright, and Ralph Meyerdirk developed the first compound contact B-mode scanner. Their work had been supported by [[United States Public Health Service|U.S. Public Health Services]] and the [[University of Colorado Denver|University of Colorado]]. Wright and Meyerdirk left the University to form Physionic Engineering Inc., which launched the first commercial hand-held articulated arm compound contact B-mode scanner in 1963. This was the start of the most popular design in the history of ultrasound scanners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Woo | first = Joseph | title = A short History of the development of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology | publisher = ob-ultrasound.net | year = 2002 | url = http://www.ob-ultrasound.net/history1.html | accessdate = 2007-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s [[Gene Strandness|Dr Gene Strandness]] and the bio-engineering group at the [[University of Washington]] conducted research on Doppler ultrasound as a diagnostic tool for vascular disease. Eventually, they developed technologies to use duplex imaging, or Doppler in conjunction with B-mode scanning, to view vascular structures in real-time, while also providing hemodynamic information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Ultrasound|volume= 21 |issue=11 |pages=1323–1325 |doi=10.1067/mva.2002.123028 |title=D. Eugene Strandness, Jr, MD, 1928–2002 |last=Zierler |first=R. Eugene |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first demonstration of color Doppler was by Geoff Stevenson, who was involved in the early developments and medical use of Doppler shifted ultrasonic energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medical Imaging Past Present and Future: 2 ARRT category A continuing education credits are available by way of an online post test at XRayCeRT.com|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DForAgAAQBAJ|publisher=XRayCeRT|id=GGKEY:6WU7UCYWQS7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:NAlogo.jpg|thumb|300px|The logo of Nicolas Appert]]

'''Nicolas Appert''' is a [[The Netherlands|Dutch]] study association for [[Food Technology]] students at [[Wageningen University]]. The association is named after the [[France|French]] inventor [[Nicolas Appert]], who can be seen as the first food technologist. The chef Nicolas Appert was researching ways to preserve food for a longer period of time and discovered that heating food products in a closed glass jar would greatly increase its shelflife. A process, nowadays called appertisation.

On September 6, 1962, during a foreign study trip, the study association Nicolas Appert was founded. Nowadays the association is still very active, having good relations with food companies and organising a lot of activities for its members.

Examples of these activities are lectures and excursions from and to food companies, but also social activities such as a sporting or drinks with the departments of Food Processing, Food Chemistry, Food Microbiology, Food Physics and Product Design and Quality Management. All these activities are made possible by the participation of a large group of active, enthusiastic students in committees and the board.

==History==

===Part of Citicorp (I-Flex Solutions)===
There was a company of CITIBANK in 1990 named as CitiCorp Oversea Software Ltd., (later known as i-flex in world market).  Over a period of time, another(?) company was merged into it and new company was started named as Citicorp Information Technologies Industries Ltd was formed. (CITIL) out of COSL and named Rajesh Hukku to head CITIL{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}.  While COSL's mandate was to serve Citicorp's internal needs globally and be a cost center, CITIL's mandate was to be profitable by serving not only Citicorp but the whole global financial software market. Largely known as i-flex and then eventually renamed to Oracle Financial Services Software

===Early history===
CITIL was started with universal banking product named as MicroBanker (which became successful in some English speaking parts of Africa and other developing regions over the next 3–4 years) and the [[retail banking]] product Finware{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}. In the mid-90s, the firm developed Flexcube (stylized FLEXCUBE) at its Bangalore  Centre. After the launch of Flexcube, all of CITIL's transnational banking products were brought under a common brand umbrella. Subsequently, company's name was changed to i-flex Solutions India Ltd.,

===Oracle Corporation===
[[File:iflex51.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Oracle Financial Services Software&amp;nbsp;– Bagmane Tech Park, Bangalore]]
Oracle purchased Citigroup's 41% stake in i-flex solutions for US$593 million in August 2005, a further 7.52% in March and April 2006, and 3.2 per cent in an open-market purchase in mid-April 2006{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}.

On 14 August 2006, oracle financial services announced it would acquire Mantas, a US-based anti-money laundering and compliance software company for US$122.6 million. The company part-funded the transaction through a preferential share allotment to majority shareholder Oracle Corporation.

On 12 January 2007, after an open offer price to minority shareholders, Oracle increased its stake in i-flex to around 83%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Oracle_stake_in_i-flex_rises_to_83_after_revised_offer/articleshow/1144292.cms Oracle stake in i-flex rises to 53% after revised offer], The Economic Times (21 January 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 April 2008,  Oracle  changed the name of the company to Oracle Financial Services Limited.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oracle.com/corporate/press/2008_apr/ofs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October 2010, Oracle announced the appointment of Chaitanya M Kamat   as Managing Director and CEO of Oracle Financial Services Software Limited.  . The outgoing CEO and MD, N.R.K.Raman retired from these posts after 25 years of service.

Now Oracle Financial Services Software Limited is a major part of Oracle Financial Services Global Business Unit (FSGBU) under Sonny Singh who is the Vice President &amp; Group Head of Oracle FSGBU World Wide.

==Products and services==

Oracle Financial Services Software Limited has two main streams of business. The products division (formerly called BPD&amp;nbsp;– Banking products Division) and PrimeSourcing. The company's offerings cover retail, corporate and investment banking, funds, cash management, trade, treasury, payments, lending, private wealth management, asset management and business analytics. The company undertook a rebranding exercise in the latter half of 2008. As part of this, the corporate website was integrated with Oracle's website and various divisions, services and products renamed to reflect the new identity post alignment with Oracle.

Recently, Oracle Financial Services launched products for Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, exposure management, enterprise performance management and energy and commodity trading compliance.

The company promotes its BPO [[business process outsourcing]] business via its subsidiary Equinox Corporation which is based in [[Irvine, California]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7191">'''Phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes''' ('''PHOLED''') are a type of [[OLED|organic light-emitting diode]] (OLED) that use the principle of [[phosphorescence]] to obtain higher internal efficiencies than [[fluorescent]] OLEDs. This technology is currently under development by many industrial and academic research groups.

==Method of operation==
[[File:Ir(mppy)3.png|thumb|Ir(mppy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, an example of a phosphorescent dopant which emits green light.&lt;ref name=yang&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/adma.200305621|title=Highly Efficient Single-Layer Polymer Electrophosphorescent Devices|year=2004|last1=Yang|first1=X.|last2=Neher|first2=D.|last3=Hertel|first3=D.|last4=Daubler|first4=T.|journal=Advanced Materials|volume=16|pages=161|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;|150px]]
{{See also|Organic_LED#Working_principle|l1=Organic LED: Working principle}} 
Like all types of OLED, phosphorescent OLEDs emit light due to the [[electroluminescence]] of an [[organic semiconductor]] layer in an electric current. Electrons and [[electron hole|holes]] are injected into the organic layer at the electrodes and form [[exciton]]s, a bound state of the electron and hole. 

Electrons and holes are both [[fermion]]s with half integer [[spin (physics)|spin]]. An exciton is formed by the [[coulombic attraction]] between the electron and the hole, and it may either be in a [[singlet state]] or a [[triplet state]], depending on the spin states of these two bound species. Statistically, there is a 25% probability of forming a singlet state and 75% probability of forming a triplet state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown|first1=A. R.|last2=Pichler|first2=K.|last3=Greenham|first3=N. C.|last4=Bradley|first4=D. D. C.|last5=Friend|first5=R. H.|last6=Holmes|first6=A. B.|year=1993|title=Optical spectroscopy of triplet excitons and charged excitations in poly(p-phenylenevinylene) light-emitting diodes |journal=Chemical Physics Letters|volume=210|pages=61–66|doi=10.1016/0009-2614(93)89100-V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baldo|first1=M. A.|last2=O'Brien|first2=D. F.|last3=Thompson|first3=M. E.|last4=Forrest|first4=S. R.|year=1999|title=Excitonic singlet-triplet ratio in a semiconducting organic thin film|journal=Physical Review B|volume=60|pages=14422–14428|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.60.14422 |issue=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decay of the excitons results in the production of light through [[spontaneous emission]].

In OLEDs using [[fluorescent]] organic molecules only, the decay of triplet excitons is quantum mechanically forbidden by [[selection rules]], meaning that the lifetime of triplet excitons is long and phosphorescence is not readily observed. Hence it would be expected that in fluorescent OLEDs only the formation of singlet excitons results in the emission of useful radiation, placing a theoretical limit on the internal [[quantum efficiency]] (the percentage of excitons formed that result in emission of a photon) of 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tsutsui|first1=T.|last2=Yang|first2=M.-J.|last3=Yahiro|first3=M.|last4=Nakamura|first4=K.|last5=Watanabe|first5=T.|last6=Tsuji|first6=T.|last7=Fukuda|first7=Y.|last8=Wakimoto|first8=T.|last9=Miyaguchi|first9=S.|year=1999|title=High Quantum Efficiency in Organic Light-Emitting Devices with Iridium-Complex as a Triplet Emissive Center|journal=Japanese Journal of Applied Physics|volume=38|pages=L1502–L1504|doi=10.1143/JJAP.38.L1502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, phosphorescent OLEDs generate light from both triplet and singlet excitons, allowing the internal quantum efficiency of such devices to reach nearly 100%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adachi|first1=C.|last2=Baldo|first2=M. A.|last3=Thompson|first3=M. E.|last4=Forrest|first4=S. R.|year=2001|title=Nearly 100% internal phosphorescence efficiency in an organic light-emitting device|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=90|pages=5048|doi=10.1063/1.1409582 |issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is commonly achieved by doping a host molecule with an [[organometallic]] [[Coordination complex|complex]]. These contain a heavy metal atom at the centre of the molecule, for example platinum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/25954|title=Highly Efficient phosphorescent emission from organic electroluminescent devices|year=1998|last1=Baldo|first1=M.

E.|last7=Forrest|first7=S.R.|journal=Nature|volume=395|pages=151|issue=6698}}&lt;/ref&gt; or iridium, of which the green emitting complex Ir(mppy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is just one of many examples.&lt;ref name=yang /&gt; The large [[spin-orbit interaction]] experienced by the molecule due to this heavy metal atom facilitates [[intersystem crossing]], a process which mixes the singlet and triplet character of excited states. This reduces the lifetime of the triplet state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.124258|title=Very high-efficiency green organic light-emitting devices based on electrophosphorescence|year=1999|last1=Baldo|first1=M. A.|last2=Lamansky|first2=S.|last3=Burrows|first3=P. E.|last4=Thompson|first4=M. E.|last5=Forrest|first5=S. R.|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=75|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Brien|first1=D. F.|last2=Baldo|first2=M. A.|last3=Thompson|first3=M. E.|last4=Forrest|first4=S. R.|doi=10.1063/1.123055|title=Improved energy transfer in electrophosphorescent devices|year=1999|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=74|pages=442|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore phosphorescence is readily observed.

==Applications==
Due to their potentially high level of energy efficiency, even when compared to other OLEDs, PHOLEDs are being studied for potential use in large-screen displays such as computer monitors or television screens, as well as general lighting needs. One potential use of PHOLEDs as lighting devices is to cover walls with large area PHOLED light panels. This would allow entire rooms to glow uniformly, rather than require the use of light bulbs which distribute light unequally throughout a room. The [[United States Department of Energy]] has recognized the potential for massive energy savings via the use of this technology and therefore has awarded $200,000 USD in contracts to develop PHOLED products for general lighting applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sidmembers.org/idonline/newsarticle.cfm?newsArt=news78|title=UDC Awarded Two Department of Energy Grants for White OLED Research|publisher=Society for Information Display|accessdate=28 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728021954/http://www.sidmembers.org/idonline/newsarticle.cfm?newsArt=news78|archivedate=28 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
One problem that currently hampers the widespread adoption of this highly energy efficient technology is that the average lifetimes of red and green PHOLEDs are often tens of thousands of hours longer than those of blue PHOLEDs. This may cause displays to become visually distorted much sooner than would be acceptable for a commercially viable device.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The '''Raleigh Bicycle Company''' is a [[bicycle]] manufacturer based in [[Nottingham]], [[England]]. Founded by Woodhead and Angois in 1885, who used Raleigh as their brand name, it is one of the oldest bicycle companies in the world. After being acquired by [[Sir Frank Bowden, 1st Baronet|Frank Bowden]], it became The Raleigh Cycle Company in December 1888, which was registered as a limited liability company in January 1889. By 1913, it was the biggest bicycle manufacturing company in the world. From 1921 to 1935, Raleigh also produced motorcycles and three-wheel cars, leading to the formation of the [[Reliant]] Company. The Raleigh division of bicycles is currently owned by the Dutch corporation [[Accell]].

In 2006, the [[Raleigh Chopper]] was named in the list of British design icons in the Great British Design Quest organised by the [[BBC]] and the [[Design Museum]].

==History==

===Early years===
The history of Raleigh bicycles started in 1885, when Richard Morriss Woodhead from [[Sherwood Forest]], and Paul Eugene Louis Angois, a French citizen, set up a small bicycle workshop in Raleigh Street, [[Nottingham]], England. In the spring of that year, they started advertising in the local press. The ''Nottinghamshire Guardian'' of 15 May 1885 printed what was possibly the first Woodhead and Angois classified advertisement.

[[File:Raleigh 1940s advert.jpg|thumb|right|Raleigh advert from 1940.]]
Nearly two years later, the 11 April 1887 issue of ''[[Nottingham Post|The Nottingham Evening Post]]'' contained a display advertisement for the Raleigh ‘Safety’ model under the new banner ‘Woodhead, Angois, and Ellis. Russell Street Cycle Works.’ William Ellis had recently joined the partnership and provided much-needed financial investment. Like Woodhead and Angois, Ellis’s background was in the lace industry. He was a lace gasser, a service provider involved in the bleaching and treating of lace, with premises in nearby Clare Street and Glasshouse Street. Thanks to Ellis, the bicycle works had now expanded round the corner from Raleigh Street into former lace works on the adjoining road, Russell Street. By 1888, the company was making about three cycles a week and employed around half a dozen men.&lt;ref name="Bowden F 1903, p.8"&gt;Bowden F, ‘To the Public’, ''The Book of the Raleigh'', Raleigh, Nottingham, 1903, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of 15 bicycle manufacturers based in Nottingham at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison A E, ‘The Competitiveness of the British Cycle Industry, 1890–1914’, ''The Economic History Review'', News Series, Vol. 22, No. 2 (Aug 1969), p.289&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Frank Bowden, 1st Baronet|Frank Bowden]], a recent convert to cycling who on medical advice had toured extensively on a tricycle, first saw a Raleigh bicycle in a shop window in [[Queen Victoria Street, London]], about the time that William Ellis’s investment in the cycle workshop was beginning to take effect.&lt;ref&gt;‘Rutulan’, ''Souvenir of the Raleigh Works'', Raleigh, 1922, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Bowden described how this led to him visiting the Raleigh works:

{{quote|″In the early part of 1887, while looking for a good specimen of the then new safety bicycle, I came across a Raleigh in London. Its patent changeable gear and other special features struck me as superior to all the others I had seen, and I purchased one upon which I toured extensively through France, Italy and England during 1887 and 1888. In the autumn of the latter year, happening to pass through Nottingham, and with the idea of, if possible, getting a still more up-to-date machine, I called upon Messrs. Woodhead and Angois, the originators and makers of the Raleigh …″&lt;ref name="Bowden F 1903, p.8"/&gt;}}

It is clear from Frank Bowden’s own account that, although he bought a Raleigh ‘Safety’ in 1887, he did not visit the Raleigh workshop until autumn 1888. That visit led to Bowden replacing Ellis as the partnership’s principal investor, though Bowden did not become the outright owner of the firm. He concluded that the company had a profitable future if it promoted its innovative features, increased its output, cut its overhead costs and tailored its products to the individual tastes and preferences of its customers. He bought out William Ellis’s share in the firm and was allotted 5,000 £1 shares, while Woodhead and Angois between them held another 5,000 shares.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd-Jones R &amp; Lewis MJ with Eason M, ''Raleigh and The British Bicycle Industry'', Ashgate, Aldershot, 2000, pp.47–49&lt;/ref&gt;

In Frank Bowden's own lifetime, Raleigh publicity material stated that the firm was founded in 1888,&lt;ref name=THadland&gt;Hadland T, ''Raleigh: Past and Presence of an Iconic Bicycle Brand'', Cycle Publishing, San Francisco, 2011, fig.8.3&lt;/ref&gt; which was when Bowden, as he himself confirmed, first bought into the enterprise. Thus, Raleigh's 30th anniversary was celebrated in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Hadland T, ''Raleigh: Past and Presence of an Iconic Bicycle Brand'', Cycle Publishing, San Francisco, 2011, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; The 1888 foundation date is confirmed by Bowden's great-grandson, Gregory Houston Bowden, who states that Frank Bowden "began to negotiate with Woodhead and Angois and in December 1888 founded 'The Raleigh Cycle Company'."&lt;ref&gt;Bowden GH, ''The Story of the Raleigh Cycle'', Allen, London, 1975, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; The December 1888 foundation date is also confirmed by Nottinghamshire Archives.&lt;ref&gt;Dorrington M et al, ''Turning Back the Pages of Raleigh Cycles of Nottingham'', Nottinghamshire County Council, 2007, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the Raleigh company has cited 1887 as a foundation date but, whilst this pre-dates Bowden's involvement, the Raleigh brand name was created by Woodhead and Angois and the enterprise can, as demonstrated above, be traced back to 1885.
[[Image:Raleigh head badge.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Raleigh USA [[head badge]].]]
The company established by Bowden in December 1888 was still privately owned with unlimited public liability. In January 1889, it became the first of a series of limited liability companies with Raleigh in its name. It had a nominal capital of £20,000, half of which was provided by Frank Bowden. Paul Angois was appointed director responsible for product design, Richard Woodhead was made director responsible for factory management, and Frank Bowden became chairman and managing director. Some shares were made available to small investors and local businessmen, but take-up was minimal, and Bowden ended up buying most of the public shares. He subsequently supplied virtually all the capital needed to expand the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd-Jones R &amp; Lewis MJ with Eason M, ''Raleigh and The British Bicycle Industry'', Ashgate, Aldershot, 2000, pp.49–50&lt;/ref&gt;

When Frank Bowden got involved with the enterprise, the works comprised three small workshops and a greenhouse. As Woodhead, Angois and Ellis, the firm had expanded round the corner from Raleigh Street into Russell Street, where also stood Clarke’s five-storey former lace factory. To enable further expansion of the business, Bowden financed the renting of this property and installation of new machinery.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd-Jones R &amp; Lewis MJ with Eason M, ''Raleigh and The British Bicycle Industry'', Ashgate, Aldershot, 2000, p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Bowden's guidance, Raleigh expanded rapidly. By 1891, the company occupied not only Clarke's factory but also Woodroffe’s Factory and Russell Street Mills.&lt;ref&gt;Raleigh catalogue, 1892, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1892, Raleigh signed a tenancy agreement for rooms in Butler’s factory on the other side of Russell Street.&lt;ref&gt;Nottinghamshire Archives DD/RN/1/1/1&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after this, the company also occupied Forest Road Mill.&lt;ref&gt;Raleigh catalogue, 1893, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; (Forest Road junctions with Russell Street at the opposite end from Raleigh Street.)

Bowden created a business which, by 1913, was the biggest bicycle manufacturing company in the world, occupying seven and a half acres in purpose-built premises completed in 1897 at Faraday Road, [[Lenton, Nottingham]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nottinghampost.com/Building-business-heritage/story-25845916-detail/story.html#ixzz47jEOZdQx "£5.2 million University of Nottingham deal will build on business heritage"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Nottingham Post. Retrieved 4 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; It subsequently became very much bigger.

Sir Frank Bowden died in 1921 and his son [[Sir Harold Bowden, 2nd Baronet]] took over as
chairman and chief executive, guiding the company through the next 17 years of expansion.&lt;ref name="Graces"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/wiki/Raleigh:_Cycles|title=Raleigh: Cycles|work=gracesguide.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001185209/http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/wiki/Raleigh:_Cycles|archivedate=1 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NottGov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/home/leisure/archives/exhibitions/wheelsoffortune.htm|title=Wheels of Fortune - The Story of Raleigh Cycles of Nottingham|work=nottinghamshire.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Raleigh lady's loop frame bicycle 1930s.jpg|thumb|1930s Raleigh lady's loop frame bicycle]]
;Humber Cycles
There was a resurgence in domestic and export demand for pedal bicycles and by February 1932 Raleigh had acquired all the [[Humber Limited]] trade marks. Manufacture was transferred to Raleigh's Nottingham works.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lloyd-Jones, Myrddin John Lewis, Mark Eason, ''Raleigh and the British Bicycle Industry: An Economic and Business History, 1870-1960'', Ashgate Publishing, 2000. {{ISBN|1859284574}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raleigh-made Humbers differed from Raleighs only in chainwheels, fork crowns and some brakework.&lt;ref name=THadland/&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], the Raleigh factory in Nottingham was used for the production of [[fuze]]s. Bicycle production was reduced to approximately 5% of its peacetime capacity.&lt;ref name="NottGov" /&gt;

In 1939, Raleigh opened a bicycle factory at 6 Hanover Quay, Dublin, Ireland and commenced bicycle production there. The Raleigh (Ireland) business expanded and moved to 8–11 Hanover Quay, Dublin in 1943. The plant produced complete bicycles and [[Sturmey-Archer]] hubs, and remained in production until 1976, when the factory burned down. Models produced there latterly were the Chopper and Triumph 20. The head badges changed in the late 1960s, possibly after the passing of the Trade Descriptions Act in the UK. Dublin-made machines no longer had "Nottingham England" on the Heron or Triumph head badge, the panel being left blank instead.

===Motor vehicles===
In 1899, Raleigh started to build motorcycles and in 1903, introduced the Raleighette, a belt-driven three-wheel motorcycle with the driver in the back and a wicker seat for the passenger between the two front wheels. Financial losses meant production lasted only until 1908.

In 1930, the company acquired the rights to the Ivy Karryall, a motorcycle fitted with a cabin for cargo and a hood for the driver. Raleigh's version was called the Light Delivery Van and had a chain drive. A two-passenger version was followed by Raleigh's first three-wheel car, the Safety Seven. It was a four-seat convertible with shaft drive and a maximum of {{convert|55|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. A saloon version was planned, but Raleigh shut its motor department to concentrate on bicycles again. Chief designer T. L. Williams took the equipment and remaining parts and moved to [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]], where his company produced three-wheelers for 65 years. The leftover parts from Raleigh carried an "R", so Williams chose a matching name: [[Reliant]].
[[Image:Raleigh Sports 1970.jpg|thumb|left|1970 Raleigh Sports in the USA.]]

Raleigh also made [[mopeds]] in the late 1950s and 1960s as the bicycle market declined. The most popular of which was the RM6 Runabout. This model featured unsprung front forks and a cycle type calliper front brake which made it a very affordable mode of transport. Because of its success, production continued until February 1971; 17 months after Raleigh had stopped manufacturing all other mopeds.

===Post War U.S. Export Market===
After [[World War II]], Raleigh became known for its lightweight ''sports [[roadster (bicycle)|roadster]]'' bicycles, often using Sturmey-Archer three and five-speed transmissions. These cycles were considerably lighter and quicker than either the old heavy English utility roadster or the American "[[Bicycle tire#Balloon|balloon-tire]]" [[cruiser bicycle|cruiser]] bikes. In 1946, Raleigh and other English bicycle manufacturers accounted for 95% of the bicycles imported into the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Petty, Ross D., ''Pedaling Schwinn Bicycles: Marketing Lessons from the Leading Post-World War II U.S. Bicycle Brand'', Babson College, MA (2007), pp. 5–6 [http://faculty.quinnipiac.edu/charm/CHARM%20proceedings/CHARM%20article%20archive%20pdf%20format/Volume%2013%202007/170-179_petty.pdf Article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514091409/http://faculty.quinnipiac.edu/charm/CHARM%20proceedings/CHARM%20article%20archive%20pdf%20format/Volume%2013%202007/170-179_petty.pdf |date=14 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raleigh's ''sports roadster'', or ''British racer'' bicycles were exported around the world, including the United States. The company continued to increase imports to the United States until 1955, when a rate increase in foreign bicycle tariffs caused a shift in imports in favour of bicycles from [[West Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]]. However, this proved only a temporary setback, and by 1964, Raleigh was again a major selling brand in the US bicycle market.&lt;ref&gt;Petty, Ross D., ''Pedaling Schwinn Bicycles'', pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raleigh RSW===
In 1965, Raleigh introduced the RSW 16, its long-awaited competitor to the hugely successful [[Moulton Bicycle]]. The new Raleigh shared several important features with the Moulton, including small wheels, an open frame and built-in luggage carrying capacity.

[[File:Raleigh rsw mk 2 bicycle drive side bootiebike 2 com.JPG|thumb|Late 1960s Raleigh RSW. The RSW was Raleigh's competitor to the fully suspended [[Moulton Bicycle]].]]

However, the RSW lacked the Moulton's suspension, which compensated for the bumpy ride that comes with small wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bootiebike.com/commentary/small_wheel_obsession.htm|title=Small wheel obsession|first=Brian|last=Conolly|date=|website=bootiebike.com|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160102123855/http://bootiebike.com/commentary/small_wheel_obsession.htm|archivedate=2 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Raleigh fitted the RSW with [[Bicycle tire#Balloon|balloon tyres]], which effectively smoothed the ride but at the cost of increased rolling resistance. Nevertheless, the RSW was pleasant to ride, and Raleigh's extensive retail network ensured its success.

The success of the RSW took sales away from the Moulton and put the maker into financial difficulties. Raleigh then bought out Moulton and produced both bikes until 1974. Raleigh also produced a sister model to the RSW, the [[Raleigh Twenty|'Twenty']], which was more successful and remained in production well into the 1980s.

===Expansion and mergers===
While bicycle production had steadily risen through the mid-1950s, the British market began to decline with the increasing affordability and popularity of the motor car. For much of the postwar era, British bicycle manufacturers had largely competed with each other in both the home and export markets, but 1956 saw the formation of the British Cycle Corporation by the [[Tube Investments|Tube Investments Group]] which already owned Phillips, Hercules, Armstrong, and [[Norman Cycles|Norman]]. In 1957, Raleigh bought the [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]] Cycles Ltd., BSA's bicycle division, which gave them exclusive use of the former brand names New Hudson and Sunbeam. Raleigh also already owned the Robin Hood brand, and Three Spires with Triumph (cycles) also at their disposal.

BSA had itself acquired [[Triumph Cycle]] Co. Ltd. only five years previously. Ti added the Sun bicycle company to their stable in 1958, and with two "super groups" now controlling a large portion of the market, it was perhaps inevitable that in 1960, Tube Investments acquired Raleigh and merged the British Cycle Corporation with Raleigh to form TI–Raleigh, which now had 75% of the UK market. TI–Raleigh then acquired [[Carlton Cycles]] in [[Worksop]], England that same year, at the time one of the largest semi-custom lightweight makers in the UK. Ti Raleigh gave total control of its cycle division to Raleigh and soon set about marketing many of the acquired names as budget ranges, though with Raleigh frames. The old British Cycle Corporation factory at Handsworth continued to produce non Raleigh branded product well into the 1970s, with Raleigh branded models built in the main plant at Nottingham. However, the Sun branded bicycles were made in the Carlton factory at Worksop, England.

As a vertically integrated manufacturer in the mid-1960s, TI–Raleigh owned [[Brooks England|Brooks]] (one of the oldest saddle makers in the world), [[Sturmey-Archer]] (pioneer of 3-speed hubs), and [[Reynolds Technology|Reynolds]] (maker of [[Reynolds 531|531 tubing]]). Carlton, which had been unable to make inroads in the USA market after a failed rebranding deal with [[Huffy]], found success in the late 1960s by recasting itself as "Raleigh-Carlton", a Raleigh-logo'd bike with some Carlton badging, and using the US dealer network to import and distribute bikes.

===The Raleigh Chopper===
{{Main|Raleigh Chopper}}

The Raleigh Chopper was designed by Nottingham native [[Alan Oakley (designer)|Alan Oakley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-18136787 |title=Raleigh Chopper designer Alan Oakley dies from cancer |publisher=BBC |date=20 May 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520201921/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-18136787 |archivedate=20 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; though this has been disputed by Cambridge designer [[Tom Karen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bikebiz.com/news/read/i-designed-the-chopper-argues-cambridge-inventor/03035 | title = I designed the Chopper, argues Cambridge inventor | publisher = BikeBiz | date = 21 Jan 2004 | accessdate = 5 Jul 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923185253/http://www.bikebiz.com/news/read/i-designed-the-chopper-argues-cambridge-inventor/03035 | archivedate = 23 September 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chopper was patented in the UK in 1967 and patented in the US in 1968.

It went on sale in the UK in 1970 and sold well, and was a key factor in reviving the company's fortunes. The ''Chopper'' featured a 3-speed Sturmey-Archer gear hub, shifted using a [[Top tube|top-tube]] mounted gear lever reminiscent of the early [[Harley-Davidson]] [[suicide shifter]] — one of its "cool" features. Other differences were the unusual frame, long padded seat with backrest, sprung suspension at the back, high-rise handlebars, and differently sized front (16") and rear (20") wheels. Tyres were wider than usual for the time, with a chunky tread on the rear wheel, featuring red highlights on the sidewall. The price was from approximately £32 for a standard ''Chopper'' to £55 for the deluxe. Two smaller versions, the ''Chipper'' and ''Tomahawk'', also sold well.

The Mk 2 ''Chopper'' was an improved version from 1972. It had the option of five-speed [[derailleur]] gears in the United States, but all UK bikes had the 3 speed hub, with the exception of a model introduced in 1973 and only available in a bizarre shade of pink. This model was discontinued in 1976. The Mk 2 had a shorter seat and the frame modified to move the rear of the seat forward, this helped prevent the bike [[wheelie|tipping up]]. The shorter seat also made it harder to ride '2 up' (2 people on the bike at a time). The ''Chopper'' remained in production until 1982, when the rising popularity of the [[BMX]] bicycle caused sales to drop off.

Raleigh revisited the chopper design in recent times, with great success although the new version has had some changes to conform to modern safety laws. Gone is the top tube shifter and long integrated seat, but the look and feel of the bike remain.

===1979-present reorganisations===
In 1979, production of Raleigh 531 butted-tube bicycles reached 10,000 units a year. In 1980, the former Carlton factory at Worksop closed and production was moved to a Lightweights facility at Nottingham. However, all bicycles made there afterward still carried the W for Worksop frame number designation. In 1982, rights to the ''Raleigh USA'' name were purchased by the [[Huffy Corporation]]. Under the terms of the agreement, ''Raleigh of England'' licensed Huffy to design and distribute Raleigh bicycles in the USA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mombat.org/Raleigh.htm |title=Raleigh Museum |publisher=Mombat.org |date=21 August 2001 |accessdate=20 May 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221112455/http://mombat.org/Raleigh.htm |archivedate=21 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Huffy was given instant access to a nationwide network of bike shops. The renamed ''Raleigh Cycle Company of America'' sold bikes in the US while the rest of the world, including Canada, received ''Raleigh of England'' bikes. At that time, production of some U.S. Raleigh models were shifted to Japan, with [[Bridgestone]] manufacturing most of these bikes. By 1984, all Raleighs for the American market, except the top-of-the range Team Professional (made in Ilkeston) and Prestige road bikes (made in Nottingham), were produced in the Far East.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Meanwhile, in the home market, Raleigh had broken into the new UK BMX market with their Burner range, which was very successful.

In 1987, the leading German bicycle manufacturer [[Derby Cycle]] bought Raleigh from Ti and Raleigh USA from Huffy. In 1988, Derby opened a factory in [[Kent, Washington]] manufacturing two Raleigh lines, the bimetallic ''Technium'' road bike line, which used heat-treated aluminum main frame tubes, thermally bonded and heat-cured to internal steel lugs using a Boeing-developed proprietary epoxy &amp;mdash; along with [[41xx steel|chromoly steel]] head tube and rear stays.  Kent also manufactured the off-road chromoly steel ''Altimetric'' line (Tangent CX, Traverse CX, Tactic CX and Talon CX 1991-1992). The factory closed in 1994. All ''Raleigh Cycle Company of America'' parts and frames from 1995 on were then [[mass production|mass-produced]] in China and [[Taiwan]] and assembled in other plants.

The high-end framesets offered for sale in Raleigh catalogues together with the frames built for Team riders were produced in Ilkeston by the Special Bicycle Developments Unit (SBDU) from 1974 to 1989 under the guidance of Gerald V O'Donovan; this production was moved to a new "Raleigh Special Products" division in Nottingham on closure of the Kent factory.

''Raleigh Canada'' had a factory in [[Waterloo, Quebec]] from 1972 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.granbyexpress.com/Actualites/Economie/2013-12-03/article-3528778/Raleigh-quitte-definitivement-Waterloo/1|title=Raleigh quitte définitivement Waterloo|publisher=Granby Express|date=3 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106213815/http://www.granbyexpress.com/Actualites/Economie/2013-12-03/article-3528778/Raleigh-quitte-definitivement-Waterloo/1|archivedate=6 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derby Cycle acquired [[Diamondback Bicycles]] in 1999.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hadland.me.uk/raleigh.htm |title=Raleigh in the Last Quarter of the 20th Century |publisher=Hadland.me.uk |date= |accessdate=20 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418052858/http://www.hadland.me.uk/raleigh.htm |archivedate=18 April 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Raleigh ceased volume production of frames in the UK and its frame-making equipment were sold by auction.&lt;ref name="hadland.me.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hadland.me.uk/raleigh.htm |accessdate=22 August 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418052858/http://www.hadland.me.uk/raleigh.htm |title=Raleigh in the last quarter of the 20th century|archivedate=18 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Derby Cycle controlled Raleigh USA, Raleigh UK, Raleigh Canada, and Raleigh Ireland. In the latter three markets, Raleigh was the number-one manufacturer of bicycles.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Derby Cycle began a series of divestitures, because of financial pressure and sold [[Sturmey-Archer]]'s factory site to the [[University of Nottingham]] and Sturmey-Archer and saddle manufacturer [[Brooks England|Brooks]] to a small company called Lenark. Lenark promised to build a new factory in [[Calverton, Nottinghamshire|Calverton]] but failed to pay the first instalment and the company entered liquidation. It was reported that the reason for selling the business, after extracting the cash for the factory site, was to have Lenark declare it insolvent so that neither Derby nor Lenark would have to pay the redundancy costs. Sturmey-Archer's assets were acquired by [[SunRace]] of Taiwan who relocated the factory to Taiwan and sales to the Netherlands. Sister company Brooks was sold to [[Selle Royal]] of Italy.

In 2001, following continuing financial problems at Derby Cycle, there was a management buy-out of all the remaining Raleigh companies led by Alan Finden-Crofts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canberrabicyclemuseum.com.au/non-australian%20manuf%20articles.htm |title=Non-Australian manuf articles |publisher=Canberrabicyclemuseum.com.au |date= |accessdate=20 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229090110/http://canberrabicyclemuseum.com.au/non-australian%20manuf%20articles.htm |archivedate=29 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
[[Image:Raleigh members.jpg|thumb|right|Riders of the 1986 Raleigh Weinmann team]]
Raleigh had a long association with cycle sport. Most notable is the [[TI–Raleigh]] team of the 1970s and 1980s. In 1980 [[Joop Zoetemelk]] won the [[Tour de France]] on a Raleigh. In the mid-1980s the Raleigh team was co-sponsored by [[Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.|Panasonic]]. In 1984, riding Raleigh-badged bicycles, Team USA scored several impressive victories at the [[Olympic Games]] in Los Angeles. The company also supplied bicycles to the French [[Système U-Gitane|Système U]] team in the late 1980s where [[Laurent Fignon]] lost the [[1989 Tour de France]] to [[Greg LeMond]] by 8 seconds. The company's special products division made race frames, including those used by the Raleigh professional team of the 1970s. Presently Raleigh as a company owns the Diamondback Bike brand as well. During the 1980s Raleigh also supported British professional teams, including ''Raleigh Banana'' and ''Raleigh Weinmann''. Raleigh's most notable riders were [[Paul Sherwin]], [[Malcolm Elliott]], [[Mark Bell (cyclist)|Mark Bell]], [[Paul Watson (cyclist)|Paul Watson]], [[Jon Clay]] and [[Jeff Williams (cyclist)|Jeff Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingarchives.com/ploegfiche.php?id=6990|title=Raleigh - Weinmann 1986|author=Cycling|work=cyclingarchives.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also sponsored a mountain bike team in the early 1990s that also raced in road events.

In 2009 it was announced that the company would be creating a new [[UCI Continental|Continental]]-level cycling team called [[Team Raleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/raleigh-back-in-the-peloton-from-2010|title=Raleigh back in the peloton from 2010|author=Hedwig Kröner|work=Cyclingnews.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106030132/http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/raleigh-back-in-the-peloton-from-2010|archivedate=6 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Team were co-sponsored by the global shipping and logistics firm GAC in 2012 and were known as Team Raleigh-GAC. The season was notable for Team Raleigh's first victory in the [[Tour Series]] Round 6 and a succession of [[Premier Calendar]] wins, which resulted in team rider Graham Briggs finishing the season at the top of [[British Cycling]]'s UK Elite Men's standings. Raleigh once again became the sole headline sponsor of the team in 2013 and the team re-paid the investment with high-profile wins in the [[Tour de Normandie]], [[Tour of the Reservoir]] and Tour Series Rounds 1 and 2.

''[[Saturday Night and Sunday Morning]]'', the 1958 debut novel by [[Alan Sillitoe]], is partly set in Raleigh's [[Nottingham]] factory, Sillitoe himself being an ex-employee of the firm.

Kevin Bacon's bicycle is a [[singlespeed]] '84 Raleigh Competition. While no differentiation is made in the film, at least three different configurations are seen on Bacon's bike during the movie: [[fixed-gear]], singlespeed, and outfitted with 0-degree trick forks during various scenes in Bacon's apartment. A possible freewheel is suggested early in the film when Bacon dismounts while in motion and a distinct clicking sound is heard until the bike stops moving. A 1984/5 Raleigh Grand Prix is used for the opening chase sequence, and a 1984 or '85 Super Course makes a brief appearance in the opening credits.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In [[climate engineering]], the '''residue-to-product ratio (RPR)''' is used to calculate how much unused [[crop residue]] might be left after harvesting a particular crop. Also called the '''residue yield''' or '''straw/grain ratio''', the equation takes the mass of residue divided by the mass of crop produced, and the result is dimensionless.&lt;ref name="Reference A"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lal |first1=R |title=World crop residues production and implications of its use as a biofuel |journal=Environment International |date=2005 |volume=31 |pages=575-584 |url=http://tinread.usarb.md:8888/tinread/fulltext/lal/biofuel.pdf |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The RPR can be used to project costs and benefits of bio-energy projects, and is crucial in determining financial sustainability. The RPR is particularly important for estimating the production of [[biochar]], a beneficial farm input obtained from crop residues through [[pyrolysis]]. However, it is important to note that RPR values are rough estimates taken from broad production statistics, and can vary greatly depending on crop variety, climate, processing, and residual moisture content.&lt;ref name="Reference B"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Koopmans |first1=Auke |last2=Koppejan |first2=Jaap |title=AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST RESIDUES - GENERATION, UTILIZATION AND AVAILABILITY |publisher=FAO |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/AD576E/ad576e00.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''ring oiler''' or '''oil ring''' is a form of oil-[[lubrication]] system for [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s.

Ring oilers were used for medium-speed applications with moderate loads, during the first half of the 20th century. These represented the later years of the [[stationary steam engine]], and the beginnings of the [[high-speed steam engine]], the internal combustion [[crude oil engine|oil engine]]&lt;ref name="Oil Engine Manual, ring oiler" &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this time [[plain bearing]]s were lubricated by drip-feed [[oil cup]]s or manually by an [[oiler (occupation)|engine tender]] with an [[oil can]]. As speeds or bearing loads later increased, forced [[pressure lubrication]] became more prevalent and the ring oiler fell from use.

A ring oiler is a simple device, consisting of a large metal ring placed around a horizontal shaft, adjacent to a bearing. An oil sump is underneath this shaft and the ring is large enough to dip into the oil. As the shaft rotates, the ring is carried round with it. The rotating ring in turn picks up some oil and deposits it onto the shaft, from where it flows sideways and lubricates the bearings. The oil ring is effectively a simple lubrication pump, with only one moving part and no complex or high-precision components. The device is crude, but automatic, effective and reliable. Unlike a drip oiler, there is also no need to close off the oiler or remove [[oil wick]]s when the machine is stopped.

Ring oilers were used for speeds up to around 1,000&amp;nbsp;rpm.&lt;ref name="Oil Engine Manual, ring oiler" /&gt; Above this, the oil tended to be thrown centrifugally from the ring, rather than carried by it (although it is still currently applied on steam turbines with speeds around 3200 rpm{{cn|date=May 2013}}). The bearing must also remain horizontal and stable, so although suitable for crankshaft main bearings, they could not be used on [[connecting rod]] big end bearings. They were not used on vehicles for similar reasons, although the engines concerned at this time were anyway too large and heavy for practical mobile use. Automatic ring oilers were particularly useful for large engines with multiple horizontally opposed cylinders, where it was otherwise difficult to access the central main bearings.&lt;ref name="Oil Engine Manual, ring oiler" /&gt; Ring oilers were most suited where bearing side-loads were relatively light, but the bearing capacity required more lubrication than could be supplied by a drip feed oiler. For this reason they were widely used on larger electric motors and generators.&lt;ref name="Croft, Electrical Machinery, ring oiler" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''small wind turbine''' is a [[wind turbine]] used for [[microgeneration]], as opposed to large commercial wind turbines, such as those found in [[wind farms]], with greater individual power output. The Canadian Wind Energy Association (CanWEA) defines "small wind" as ranging from less than 1000 Watt (1&amp;nbsp;kW) turbines up to 300&amp;nbsp;kW turbines.&lt;ref name=CanWEAp3-4&gt;{{cite report|date=|title=Small Wind Turbine Purchasing Guide|url=http://www.ontario-sea.org/Storage/39/3065_Small_Wind_Turbine_Purchasing_Guide_-_Off-grid,_Residential,_Farm_&amp;_Small_Business_Applications.pdf|publisher=Canadian Wind Energy Association|pages=3–4|accessdate=1 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302211547/http://www.ontario-sea.org/Storage/39/3065_Small_Wind_Turbine_Purchasing_Guide_-_Off-grid%2C_Residential%2C_Farm_%26_Small_Business_Applications.pdf|archivedate=2 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller turbines may be as small as a 50 Watt auxiliary power generator for a boat, caravan, or miniature refrigeration unit. The IEC-61400-2:2006 Standard defines small wind turbines as wind turbines with a rotor swept area smaller than 200 m2, generating at a voltage below 1000 Va.c. or 1500 Vd.c.

== Design ==
[[File:Evance R9000 5kW small domestic wind turbine.JPG|thumb|Evance R9000 5kW small domestic wind turbine with 5.5m rotor diameter]]

Smaller scale turbines for residential scale use are available. Their blades are usually {{convert|1.5|to(-)|3.5|m}} in diameter and produce 1-10&amp;nbsp;kW of electricity at their optimal wind speed.&lt;ref name=CanWEAp3-4 /&gt; Some units have been designed to be very lightweight in their construction, e.g. 16&amp;nbsp;kilograms (35&amp;nbsp;lb), allowing sensitivity to minor wind movements and a rapid response to wind gusts typically found in urban settings and easy mounting much like a television antenna. It is claimed, and a few are certified, as being inaudible even a few feet (about a metre) under the turbine.

The majority of small wind turbines are traditional [[horizontal axis wind turbine]]s,&lt;ref name="pgWEB"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8CxjbMz8fo4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=da#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Gipe, Paul.

Accessed: 18 December 2010.] {{ISBN|1-60358-030-1}} {{ISBN|978-1-60358-030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[vertical axis wind turbine]]s are a growing type of wind turbine in the small-wind market. Makers of vertical axis wind turbines such as WePower, [[Urban Green Energy]], Helix Wind, and Windspire Energy, have reported increasing sales over the previous years.

The generators for small wind turbines usually are three-phase [[alternating current]] generators and the trend is to use the [[Induction generator|induction type]]. They are options for [[direct current]] output for battery charging and [[power inverter]]s to convert the power back to AC but at constant frequency for [[Electrical grid|grid]] connectivity. Some models utilize [[single-phase generator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Forsyth|first=Trudy|title=Small Wind Technology|url=http://ww2.wapa.gov/sites/western/renewables/Documents/webcast/2SmallWindtech.pdf|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=20 September 2013|date=20 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Endurance E-3120-50 kW Wind Turbine from Endurance Wind Power|url=http://www.azocleantech.com/news.aspx?newsID=10161|accessdate=20 September 2013|newspaper=AZoNetwork|date=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some small wind turbines can be designed to work at low wind speeds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenoptimistic.com/small-scale-dragonfly-like-wind-turbine-works-low-wind-speed-20131028/|title=Small-Scale "Dragonfly" Wind Turbine Works at Low Wind Speeds|publisher=Green Optimistic|first1=Mila|last1=Luleva|date=28 October 2013|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in general small wind turbines require a minimum wind speed of {{convert|4|m/s|ft/s}}.&lt;ref name=CanWEAp6&gt;{{cite report|date=|title=Small Wind Turbine Purchasing Guide|url=http://www.ontario-sea.org/Storage/39/3065_Small_Wind_Turbine_Purchasing_Guide_-_Off-grid,_Residential,_Farm_&amp;_Small_Business_Applications.pdf|publisher=Canadian Wind Energy Association|page=6|accessdate=1 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302211547/http://www.ontario-sea.org/Storage/39/3065_Small_Wind_Turbine_Purchasing_Guide_-_Off-grid%2C_Residential%2C_Farm_%26_Small_Business_Applications.pdf|archivedate=2 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dynamic braking]] regulates the speed by dumping excess energy, so that the turbine continues to produce electricity even in high winds. The dynamic braking resistor may be installed inside the building to provide heat (during high winds when more heat is lost by the building, while more heat is also produced by the braking resistor). The location makes low voltage (around 12&amp;nbsp;volt) distribution practical.

Small units often have direct drive generators, direct current output, lifetime bearings and use a vane to point into the wind. Larger, more costly turbines generally have geared power trains, alternating current output and are actively pointed into the wind. Direct drive generators are also used on some large wind turbines.

Turbines are often mounted on a tower to raise them above any nearby obstacles. One rule of thumb is that turbines should be at least {{convert|9|m|abbr=on}} higher than anything within {{convert|150|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Hugh Piggott | url = http://www.scoraigwind.com/citywinds/ | title = Windspeed Measurement In The City |publisher = Scoraigwind.com | date = 6 January 2007 | accessdate = 4 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Better locations for wind turbines are far away from large upwind obstacles. Measurements made in a boundary layer wind tunnel have indicated that significant detrimental effects associated with nearby obstacles can extend up to 80 times the obstacle's height downwind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=224426&amp;id=2&amp;as=false&amp;or=false&amp;qs=Ns%3DPublicationYear%257c1%26N%3D4294892717 |title = Wind tunnel measurements near an obstacle | publisher = Ntrs.nasa.gov | date = 15 October 2011 | accessdate = 4 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is an extreme case. Another approach to siting a small turbine is to use a shelter model to predict how nearby obstacles will affect local wind conditions. Models of this type are general and can be applied to any site. They are often developed based on actual wind measurements, and can estimate flow properties such as mean wind speed and turbulence levels at a potential turbine location, taking into account the size, shape, and distance to any nearby obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url = http://pdf.aiaa.org/preview/2010/CDReadyMASM10_1812/PV2010_828.pdf | title = Development of a Neural Network based Obstacle Wake Model | format = PDF | accessdate = 4 December 2011 }}{{dead link|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small wind turbine can be installed on a roof. Installation issues then include the strength of the roof, vibration, and the turbulence caused by the roof ledge. [[Unconventional wind turbines#Rooftop wind-turbines|Small-scale rooftop turbines]] suffer from turbulence and rarely generate significant amounts of power, especially in towns and cities.&lt;ref name="home_turbines"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article706123.ece | title = Home wind turbines dealt killer blow | work = The Sunday Times | location = UK | first = Jonathan | last = Leake | date = 2006-04-16 | accessdate = 2009-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Markets ==

=== Japan ===

In July 2012, a new [[feed-in tariff]] approved by Japanese Industry Minister Yukio Edano went into effect, promising to boost the country's production of wind and solar energy production. The country is aiming to increase renewable energy investment in part as a response to the Fukushima radiation crisis in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/18/us-energy-renewables-japan-idUSBRE85H00Z20120618 | title = Japan approves renewable subsidies in shift from nuclear power | publisher = Reuters | accessdate = 18 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The feed-in tariff applies to solar panels and small wind turbines and requires utilities to buy back electricity generated from renewable energy sources at government-established rates.

Small-scale wind power (turbines of less than 20&amp;nbsp;kW capacity) will be subsidized at least 57.75 JPY (about 0.74 USD per kwh).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2012/06/japan-approves-feed-in-tariffs | title = Japan Approves Feed-in Tariffs | publisher = Reuters | accessdate = 22 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===

Properties in rural or suburban parts of the UK can opt for a wind turbine with inverter to supplement local grid power. The UK's Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS) provides feed-in tariffs to owners of qualified small wind turbines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Generate-your-own-energy/Financial-incentives/Feed-In-Tariffs-scheme-FITs | title = Feed-In Tariffs Scheme (FITs) | publisher = MCS | accessdate = 29 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

Small wind turbines added a total of 17.3 MW of generating capacity throughout the United States in 2008, according to the [[American Wind Energy Association]] (AWEA). That growth equaled a 78% increase in the domestic market for small wind turbines, which are defined as wind turbines with capacities of 100&amp;nbsp;kW or less. AWEA's "2009 Small Wind Global Market Study", published in late 2009 May, credited the increase in part to greater manufacturing volumes, as the industry was able to attract enough private investment to finance manufacturing plant expansions. It also credited rising electricity prices and greater public awareness of wind technologies for an increase in residential sale. But a poll of small wind manufacturers found that the growth in 2008 might be only a glimmer of things to come, as the companies projected a 30-fold growth in the U.S. small wind market within as little as five years, despite the global recession. The U.S. small wind industry also benefits from the global market, as it controls about half of the global market share. U.S. manufacturers garnered $77 million of the $156 million that was spent throughout the world on small wind turbine installations. A total of 38.7 MW of small wind power capacity was installed globally in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=12571 | title = EERE News: AWEA: U.S. Market for Small Wind Turbines Grew 78% in 2008 | publisher = Apps1.eere.energy.gov | accessdate = 4 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, residential wind turbines with outputs of 2–10&amp;nbsp;kW, typically cost between {{US$|12,000}} and {{US$|55,000}} installed ({{US$|6}} per watt), although there are incentives and rebates available in 19 states that can reduce the purchase price for homeowners by up to 50 percent, to $3 per watt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Shevory |first = Kristina | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/13/garden/13wind.html?em&amp;ex=1197954000&amp;en=57b42d0a2f9ce2be&amp;ei=5087%0A | title = Homespun Electricity, From the Wind | work = The New York Times | date = 13 December 2007 | accessdate = 4 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The US manufacturer Southwest Windpower estimates a turbine to pay for itself in energy savings in 5 to 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windenergy.com/index_wind.htm |title=Southwest Windpower |publisher=Windenergy.com |accessdate=4 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111063638/http://www.windenergy.com/index_wind.htm |archivedate=11 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windenergy.com/content/commercial/commercial-case-studies|title=Wind Power for Commercial Projects: Case Studies|publisher=XZERES|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant models on the market, especially in the United States, are [[horizontal-axis wind turbine]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

To enable consumers to make an informed decision when purchasing a small wind turbine, a method for consumer labeling has been developed by IEA Wind Task 27 in collaboration with IEC TC88 MT2. In 2011 IEA Wind published a Recommended Practice, which describes the tests and procedures required to apply the label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ieawind.org | title = IEA Wind Home Page | publisher = Ieawind.org | accessdate = 4 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Croatia ===
[[File:Hybrid system, 2400W windturbines, 4000W solar modules, island Zirje, Croatia.jpg|thumb|Hybrid system, 2400W windturbines, 4000W solar modules, island [[Žirje, Croatia|Žirje]], [[Croatia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://veneko.hr/realizirani-sustavi-rezultati.html|title=Kako i zašto ostvarujemo najbolje rezultate|language=HU|publisher=Veneko|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Croatia is an ideal market for small wind turbines due to [[Mediterranean climate]] and numerous islands with no access to the electric grid. In winter months when there is less sun, but more wind, small wind turbines are a great addition to isolated renewable energy sites ([[GSM]], stations, marinas etc.). That way solar and wind power provide consistent energy throughout the year.

=== Germany ===
In Germany the feed-in tariff for small wind turbines has always been the same as for large turbines. This is the main reason the small wind turbine sector in Germany developed slowly. In contrast, small photovoltaic systems in Germany benefited from a high feed-in tariff, at times above 50 Euro-Cent per kilowatt hour.

In August 2014 the German renewable energy law was adjusted, also affecting the feed-in tariffs for wind turbines. For the operation of a small wind turbine with a capacity below 50 kilowatt the tariff amounts to 8.5 Euro-Cent for a period of 20 years.

Due to the low feed-in tariff and high electricity prices in Germany, the economic operation of a small wind turbine depends on a large self-consumption rate of the electricity produced by the small wind turbine. Private households pay on average 28 cent per kilowatt hour for electricity (19% VAT included).

As part of the German renewable energy law 2014 a fee on self-consumed electricity was introduced in August 2014. The regulation does not apply to small power plants with a capacity below 10 kilowatt. With an amount of 1.87 Euro-Cents the fee is low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.klein-windkraftanlagen.com/welcome-to-the-german-small-wind-turbine-portal/ | title = German Small Wind Turbine Portal | publisher = klein-windkraftanlagen.com | accessdate = 4 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company profile==
===History===
[[File:Smithfield Foods processing plant from Ivy Hill Cemetery.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Smithfield processing plant in [[Smithfield, Virginia|Smithfield]], [[Virginia]]]]
The company traces its history to 1936, when Joseph W. Luter Sr. and his son, Joseph W. Luter Jr., opened the [[Smithfield Packing Company]] in Smithfield, Virginia. The men were working for P. D. Gwaltney when they set up the company; Joseph W. Luter Sr. was a salesman and Joseph W. Luter Jr. the general manager. Financing for the new company came from Peter Pruden of Suffolk and John S. Martin of Richmond. In an interview in 2009, [[Joseph W. Luter III]] described how the Luters would buy 15 hog carcasses a day, cut them up, box them, and sell them to small stores in Newport News and Norfolk. They built the Smithfield Packing Company plant in 1946 on [[Virginia State Route 10|Highway 10]].&lt;ref name=Ernsberger&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ernsberger, Jr.|first1=Richard|title=The Ham Man|url=http://www.virginialiving.com/culture/the-ham-man/|work=Virginia Living|date=September 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph W. Luter Jr. served as Smithfield's chief executive officer (CEO) until his death in 1962.&lt;ref name=Turner323/&gt; He owned 42 percent of the company when he died.&lt;ref name=Ernsberger/&gt; His son, [[Joseph W. Luter III]], was at [[Wake Forest University]] at the time and joined Smithfield that year. Working in sales, he borrowed enough to buy a further eight-and-a-half percent of the shares, and in 1966 he became chairman and CEO.&lt;ref name=Ernsberger/&gt;&lt;ref name=Turner323/&gt; He told ''Virginia Living'' that when he took over Smithfield, the company was killing around 3,000 hogs a day, and when he left in January 1970, the figure was 5,000; the number of employees had risen from 800 to 1,400. In July 1969 he sold the company to Liberty Equities for $20 million; they had asked him to stay on, but in January 1970 they fired him. From then until 1975 he developed a ski resort, Bryce Mountain, in Virginia.&lt;ref name=Ernsberger/&gt;

At the recommendation of the banks, Smithfield hired Luter as CEO again in April 1975, when it found itself in financial difficulties. At the time, according to Luter, the company had a net worth of under $1 million, debt of $17 million, and losses of $2 million a year. He said it even lost money in December 1974, which, considering it was holiday-ham season, "was like Budweiser losing money in July".&lt;ref name=Ernsberger/&gt; Luter's restructuring of the company is credited with its improved performance.&lt;ref name=Turner323&gt;{{cite book | title=Vault Guide to the Top Consumer Products Employers | publisher=Vault Inc. | author=Turner, Tyya | year=2007 | page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aT59Q0J1QV0C&amp;pg=PA323 323] | isbn=978-1581313239}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son, Joseph W. Luter IV, became an executive vice-president of Smithfield Foods in 2008 and president of the Smithfield Packing Company, by then the parent company's largest subsidiary.&lt;ref name=history2/&gt; Joseph W. Luter III remained as CEO until 2006 and was chairman until the company was sold to WH Group in 2013. Joseph W.

===Mergers and acquisitions===
Joseph W. Luter III began his expansion of Smithfield in 1981 with the purchase of its main competitor, Gwaltney of Smithfield, for $42 million.&lt;ref name=Ernsberger/&gt; This was followed by the acquisition of almost 40 companies in the pork, beef, and livestock industries between 1981 and around 2008,&lt;ref name=Calamuci&gt;Calamuci, Daniel (Spring 2008). "Return to the Jungle: The Rise and Fall of Meatpacking Work", ''New Labor Forum'', 17(1) (pp. 66–77), p.&amp;nbsp;73. {{jstor|40342745}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Esskay|Esskay Meats]]/Schluderberg-Kurdle in Baltimore, Valley Dale in Roanoke,&lt;ref name=Ernsberger/&gt; and [[Patrick Cudahy]] in Milwaukee in 1984.&lt;ref name=history2/&gt; In 1992 Smithfield opened the world's largest processing plant, a 973,000-square-foot facility in Tar Heel, North Carolina, which by 2000 could process 32,000 pigs a day.&lt;ref name=Barboza/&gt;

Smithfield purchased John Morrell &amp; Co in Sioux Falls, SD, in 1995 and Circle Four Farms in 1998. In 1999 it bought two of the largest pig producers in the United States: Carroll's Foods and Murphy Family Farms of North Carolina, at that point the largest producer. According to agricultural researchers Jill Hobbs and Linda Young, Smithfield's purchase of these companies constituted a "major structural change" in the hog industry in the United States, leaving Smithfield in control of 10–15 percent of the country's hog production.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, Jill E.; Young, Linda M. (June 2001).

[[Farmland Industries|Farmland Foods]] of Kansas City was added in 2003, as were [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee's European Meats]], ConAgra Foods Refrigerated Meats, [[Butterball]] (the poultry producer), and [[Premium Standard Farms]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=history2&gt;[http://www.smithfieldfoods.com/our_company/1965.aspx "1965–1936"]; [http://www.smithfieldfoods.com/our_company/2000.aspx "2000–1966"]; [http://www.smithfieldfoods.com/our_company/present.aspx "Present–2010"]; [http://www.smithfieldfoods.com/our_company/leadership.aspx?cat=2 "Corporate Officers"], Smithfield Foods, undated.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/30/business/company-news-smithfield-in-stock-deal-for-tyson-s-hog-operations.html Company News: Smithfield in Stock Deal for Tyson's Hog Operations"], ''The New York Times'', September 30, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Smithfield sold its 49 percent share in Butterball in 2008 for an estimated $175 million.&lt;ref&gt;Felberbaum, Michael.

After Smithfield's purchase of Murphy Family Farms, the Agriculture Department described it as "absurdly big".&lt;ref name=Barboza/&gt; As of 2006 four companies—Smithfield, [[Tyson Foods]], [[JBS USA|Swift &amp; Company]], and [[Cargill]]—were responsible for the production of 70 percent of pork in the United States.&lt;ref name=Calamuci/&gt;

===Purchase by Shuanghui Group===
On May 29, 2013, [[Shuanghui Group|WH Group Ltd.]], then known as Shuanghui Group or Shineway Group, the largest meat producer in China, announced the purchase of Smithfield Foods for $4.72 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/29/us-shuanghui-idUSBRE94S0K920130529 | title=China's appetite for pork spurs $4.7 billion Smithfield deal | publisher=Reuters | date=29 May 2013 |author1=Thomas, Denny  |author2=Oran, Olivia |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shuanghui announced that it would list Smithfield on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] after completing the takeover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/17/us-smithfield-shuanghui-idUSBRE96F0BA20130717| title=Exclusive: Smithfield's China bidders plan Hong Kong IPO after deal – sources |author1=Saeed Azhar  |author2=Stephen Aldred  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher=Reuters | date=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 6, 2013, the U.S. government approved Shuanghui International Holding’s purchase of Smithfield Food, Inc. The deal was valued at approximately $7.1 billion, which included debt. It was the largest stock acquisition by a Chinese company of an American company. At the time of the deal, China was one of the U.S's largest pork importers, although it had 475 million pigs of its own, roughly 60 percent of the global total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/us-china-smithfield-96399.html#ixzz2eMELOmzX | title=U.S. approves Chinese company’s purchase of Smithfield | author=Doug Palmer | publisher=Politico.com | date=September 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Debbie Stabenow, [http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/united-states-food-innovation-096238 "Protect American food innovation"], ''Politico'', September 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Smithfield's CEO, Ken Sullivan, said in 2017 that he sees the company's future as a "consumer-packaged goods business".&lt;ref name=Hanacek&gt;Andy Hanacek, [http://www.provisioneronline.com/articles/104420-smithfield-foods-dawn-of-a-golden-age?

For decades Smithfield had run its acquisitions as independent operating companies, but in 2015, after the purchase by WH Group, it set up the "One Smithfield" initiative to unify them. Circle Four Farms in Milford, Utah, for example, became Smithfield Hog Production-Rocky Mountain Region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2015/08/29/circle-four-changes-name-smithfield/71408562/ "Circle Four changes name to Smithfield"], ''USA Today'', August 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hanacek/&gt; In 2016 Smithfield purchased the Californian pork processor Clougherty Packing PLC for $145 million, along with its Farmer John and Saag's Specialty Meats brands.

===Employees, brands===
In 2016 Smithfield had 50,200 employees in the United States, Mexico and Europe, and an annual revenue of $14&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="2016-10-K"/&gt; As of July 2017, the company's brands included [[Armour and Company|Armour]], Berlinki, Carando, [[Cook's Ham|Cook's]], Curly's, [[Eckrich]], Farmland, Gwaltney, Healthy Ones, John Morrell, Krakus, Kretschmar, Margherita, Morliny, Nathan's Famous, and Smithfield.&lt;ref name=brandsJuly2017&gt;[https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/07/20/1054758/0/en/Smithfield-Foods-Saratoga-Food-Specialties-Recognized-as-Yum-Brands-Supplier-of-the-Year.html "Smithfield Foods’ Saratoga Food Specialties Recognized as Yum!

===Lobbying===
Amongst those involved in the meat processing and products industry, Smithfield has so far made the largest contribution towards lobbying the US government during 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/lobbying.php?ind=G2300s "Smithfield to buy three Romanian meat facilities"], ''Open Secrets'', August 15, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Pig production==
===Vertical integration, contract farms===
In 1990 Smithfield began buying hog-farming operations, making it a [[Vertical integration|vertically integrated]] company. As a result, it was able to expand by over 1,000 percent between 1990 and 2005.&lt;ref name=Tietz/&gt; Vertical integration allows Smithfield to control every stage of pig production, from conception and birth, to slaughter, processing and packing, a system known as "from squeal to meal" or "from birth to bacon".&lt;ref name=Barboza/&gt;

The company contracted farmers who had moved out of tobacco farming, and sent them piglets between eight and ten weeks old to be brought to market weights on diets controlled by Smithfield.&lt;ref name=Horowitz2005p134&gt;Horowitz, Roger. ''Putting Meat on the American Table: Taste, Technology, Transformation''. Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;134.&lt;/ref&gt; Smithfield retained ownership of the pigs. Only farmers able to handle thousands of pigs were contracted, which meant that smaller farms went out of business.&lt;ref name=Tietz/&gt; In North Carolina, Smithfield's expansion mirrored hog farmers' decline; there were 667,000 hog farms there in 1980 and 67,000 in 2005. When the U.S. government placed restrictions on the company, it moved into Eastern Europe. As a result, in Romania there were 477,030 hog farms in 2003 and 52,100 in 2007. There was a similar decline, by 56 percent between 1996 and 2008, in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Gisolfi, Monica R. ''The Takeover: Chicken Farming and the Roots of American Agribusiness''. University of Georgia Press, 2017, p.&amp;nbsp;72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carvajal, Doreen; Castle, Stephen. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/06/business/global/06smithfield.html "A U.S. Hog Giant Transforms Eastern Europe"], ''The New York Times'', May 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, Elizabeth C. "Standards and Person-Making in East Central Europe", in Aihwa Ong and Stephen J. Collier (eds.), ''Global Assemblages: Technology, Politics, and Ethics as Anthropological Problems'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lPP-L3155QYC&amp;pg=PA178 178].&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph W. Luter III said that vertical integration produces "high quality, consistent products with consistent genetics".&lt;ref name=Barboza/&gt; The company obtained 2,000 pigs and the rights to their genetic lines from Britain's National Pig Development Company in 1990, and used them to create Smithfield Lean Generation Pork, which the American Heart Association certified for its low fat, salt, and cholesterol content.&lt;ref name=Horowitz2005p134/&gt;&lt;ref name=Turner323/&gt; According to Luter, it was vertical integration that enabled this.&lt;ref name=Turner323/&gt;

===Housing and lagoons===
[[File:Concentrated animal feeding operation, Missouri (1).JPG|left|thumb|Smithfield [[Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation|CAFO]], [[Unionville, Missouri]], 2013]]
The pigs are housed together in their thousands in identical barns with metal roofs, known as [[concentrated animal feeding operation]]s (CAFOs). The floors of the buildings are slatted, allowing waste to be flushed into 30-feet-deep "open-air pits the size of two football fields", according to the ''Washington Post''. These are referred to within the industry as [[anaerobic lagoon]]s.&lt;ref name=Fainaru/&gt;{{rp|2}} They dispose of effluent at a low cost, but they require large areas and release odors and [[methane]], a major contributor to [[greenhouse gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Massé|first1=D.

Smithfield Foods states that the lagoons contain an impervious liner made to withstand leakage.&lt;ref name=Fainaru&gt;Fainaru, Steve.

It's indicative of lower odor and lower nutrient content."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6DwXeLA9m?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20121012060254/http://www.smithfieldfoods.com/RollingStone/ "Rolling Stone's 'Bosshog' Article: Fiction vs. Fact"], Smithfield Foods, undated.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smithfield has come under criticism for the millions of gallons of untreated fecal matter it produces and stores in the lagoons. In 2012 it produced at least 4.7 billion gallons of manure in the United States; during their lifetimes, every pig will produce 1,100–1,300 liters.&lt;ref name=Maron12July2013/&gt; In a four-year period in North Carolina in the 1990s, 4.7 million gallons of hog fecal matter were released into the state's rivers. Workers and residents near Smithfield plants reported health problems and complained about the stench.&lt;ref name=Tietz/&gt; The company was fined $12.6 million in 1997 by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) for 6,900 violations of the [[Clean Water Act]] after discharging illegal levels of slaughterhouse waste into the [[Pagan River]] in Virginia.&lt;ref name=EPA1997&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/1997/August97/331enr.htm "Smithfield Foods Fined $12.6 million, Largest Clean Water Act Fine Ever"], Environmental Protection Agency, August 8, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Its facilities in North Carolina came under scrutiny in 1999 when [[Hurricane Floyd]] flooded lagoons holding fecal matter; many of Smithfield's contract farms were accused of polluting the rivers. Smithfield reached a settlement in 2000 with the state of North Carolina, agreeing to pay the state $50&amp;nbsp;million over 25 years.&lt;ref name=settlement/&gt;{{efn|The company agreed to donate $1.3&amp;nbsp;million to clean up; North Carolina State University would receive $15&amp;nbsp;million to research the treatment of pig waste; and the North Carolina Foundation for Soil and Water Conservation, Ducks Unlimited and the North Carolina Coastal Federation would receive grants.&lt;ref name=settlement&gt;[http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/settlements/07416/hog-waste.html "Smithfield Foods"], lawyersandsettlements.com, March 13, 2007, attributed to ABC News.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Deptolla/&gt;{{rp|7}}}}

According to Ralph Deptolla of Smithfield Foods, the company created new executive positions to monitor the environmental issues. In 2001 it created an [[environmental management system]] and the following year hired Dennis Treacy, director of the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality since 1998, as executive vice president and [[chief sustainability officer]]. Treacy had previously been involved in the enforcement efforts against Smithfield.&lt;ref name=Deptolla/&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=1522487&amp;privcapId=303885&amp;previousCapId=303885&amp;previousTitle=Smithfield%20Foods,%20Inc.

===Operations in Mexico===
{{farming}}
The earliest confirmed case of the [[H1N1]] virus (swine flu) during the [[2009 flu pandemic]] was in a five-year-old boy in [[La Gloria, Veracruz|La Gloria]], Mexico, near several facilities operated by Granjas Carroll de Mexico, a Smithfield Foods subsidiary that processes 1.2&amp;nbsp;million pigs a year and employs 907 people.&lt;ref name=Fainaru/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lacey&gt;Lacey, Marc (April 28, 2009).

According to ''The Washington Post'', over 600 other residents of La Gloria became ill from a respiratory disease in March that year (later thought to be seasonal flu). The ''Post'' writes that health officials found no link between the farms and the H1N1 outbreak.&lt;ref name=Fainaru/&gt; Smithfield said that it had found no clinical signs of swine flu in its pigs or employees in Mexico, and had no reason to believe that the outbreak was connected to its Mexican facilities. The company said it routinely administers flu virus vaccine to its swine herds in Mexico and conducts monthly tests to detect the virus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investors.smithfieldfoods.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=379761 "Smithfield Foods Says It Found No Evidence of Swine Influenza at Its Mexican Joint Ventures"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503155300/http://investors.smithfieldfoods.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=379761 |date=2009-05-03 }}, Smithfield Foods, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Residents alleged that the company regularly violates local environmental regulations.&lt;ref name=TuckmanApril292009&gt;Tuckman, Jo (April 29, 2009). [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/apr/29/swine-flu-mexico-la-gloria "Attention turns to La Gloria in search to determine swine flu source"], ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, Caroline (April 28, 2009). [http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/apr/28/swine-flu-intensive-farming-caroline-lucas "Swine flu: is intensive pig farming to blame?"], ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Washington Post'', local farmers had complained for years about headaches from the smell of the pig farms and said that wild dogs had been eating discarded pig carcasses. Smithfield was using [[Anaerobic digestion|biodigester]]s to convert dead pigs into renewable energy, but residents alleged that they regularly overflowed. Residents also feared that the waste stored in the lagoons would leak into the groundwater.&lt;ref name=Fainaru/&gt;

===Packaging reduction===
In 2009 Armour-Eckrich introduced smaller crescent-style packaging for its smoked sausages, which reduced the plastic film and corrugated cardboard the company used by over 840,000&amp;nbsp;pounds per year. In 2010 the John Morrell plant in Sioux Falls, SD, reduced its use of plastic by 40,600&amp;nbsp;pounds a year, and Farmland Foods reduced the corrugated packaging entering waste streams by over five million pounds a year. Smithfield Packing used 17&amp;nbsp;percent less plastic for deli meat. The company also eliminated 20,000&amp;nbsp;pounds of corrugated material a year by using smaller boxes to transport chicken frankfurters to its largest customer.&lt;ref name=EL&gt;[http://www.environmentalleader.com/2010/07/23/smithfield-foods-csr-report-commits-to-reduce-energy-and-water-use-solid-waste-10-by-2016 "Smithfield Foods CSR Report: Commits to Reduce Energy and Water Use, Solid Waste 10% by 2016"], ''Environmental Leader'', July 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of antibiotics===
Concerns have been raised about Smithfield's use of low doses of antibiotics to promote the pigs' growth, in addition to using antibiotics as part of a treatment regime. The concern was that the antibiotics were harmful to the animals and were contributing to the rise of [[Antibiotic resistance|antibiotic-resistant]] strains of bacteria.&lt;ref name=Deptolla/&gt;{{rp|8}} Smithfield said in 2005 that it would administer antibiotics only to animals who were sick themselves, or who were in close proximity to sick animals; however, in CAFOs all pigs are in close proximity to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Riha, Carol Ann.

===2006 CIWF investigation===
In Poland, Smithfield Foods purchased former state farms for what its CEO said were "small dollars" and turned them into CAFOs using grants from the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]].&lt;ref&gt;Tracy Worcester, [https://www.newstatesman.com/business-food-and-drink/2011/03/pig-farms-farmers-european "Cheap meat comes at a high price"], ''New Statesman'', March 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Compassion in World Farming]] (CIWF) conducted an undercover investigation into Smithfield CAFOs there in 2006, and found sick and injured animals in the barns, and dead animals rotting. The CAFOs were run by Animex, a Smithfield subsidiary. In one barn, 26 pigs were reported to have died in a five-week period. The CIWF report said of a Smithfield lagoon in [[Boszkowo]]: "Everywhere is the detritus of industrial factory farming—plastic syringe casings, intravenous needles and white clinical gloves—floating in the rancid cesspit and discarded on adjacent farmland."&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Barnett and Urmee Khan, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/apr/02/animalwelfare.foodanddrink?INTCMP=SRCH "'Shocking' farms raise pigs for UK"], ''The Observer'', April 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 HSUS investigation===
In December 2010 the [[Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) released an undercover video taken by one of its investigators inside a Smithfield Foods facility.&lt;ref name=NYTStrom/&gt; The investigator had worked for a month at Murphy-Brown, a Smithfield subsidiary in Waverly, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.timesdispatch.com/news/2010/dec/16/humane-society-investigation-reports-smithfield-pi-ar-719289/ "Humane Society says Smithfield mistreated pigs"], ''Richmond Times-Dispatch'', December 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Associated Press (AP) reported that the investigator videotaped 1,000 sows living in [[gestation crates]]. According to the AP, the material shows a pig being pulled by the snout, shot in the head with a stun gun, and thrown into a bin while trying to wriggle free. The investigator said he saw sows biting their crates and bleeding; staff jabbing them to make them move; staff tossing piglets into carts; and piglets born prematurely in gestation crates falling through the slats into the manure pits.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;[http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2010/12/15/humane_society_claims_pigs_abused_at_va_farm/ "Humane Society Claims Pigs Abused at Va.

In response, Smithfield told the AP that it has "zero tolerance for any behavior that does not conform to our established animal well-being procedures".&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; The company asked [[Temple Grandin]], a professor of animal husbandry, to review the footage; she recommended an inspection by animal welfare expert Jennifer Woods.&lt;ref name=AP21Dec2010&gt;[http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2013730404_apuspigabusesmithfield.html "Smithfield fires 3 workers for mistreating pigs"], Associated Press, December 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Joe.

===Lawsuits===
In 2010 a jury in [[Jackson County, Missouri]], awarded 13 plaintiffs $825,000 each against a Smithfield subsidiary, Premium Standard. Two other plaintiffs were awarded $250,000 and $75,000. The plaintiffs argued that they were unable to enjoy their property because of the smell coming from the Smithfield facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missourifarmertoday.com/news/jury-awards-plaintiffs-m-total-in-hog-lawsuit/article_5e48bc8a-04a1-514b-aa0e-54cf4942f390.html "Jury awards plaintiffs $11M total in hog lawsuit"], ''Missouri Farmer Today'', March 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 in [[Wake County]], North Carolina, nearly 500 residents sued a Smithfield subsidiary, Murphy-Brown, in 26 lawsuits, alleging nuisance and ill health caused by smells, open-air lagoons, and pig carcasses. Residents said their outdoor activities were limited as a consequence, and that they were unable to invite visitors to their homes. Smithfield said the complaints were without merit.&lt;ref&gt;Murawski, John. [http://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article147425529.html "Do hog farms make their neighbors ill? Jurors may decide soon."], ''The News &amp; Observer'', 28 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 3, 2018, a federal jury awarded six North Carolina residents $470 million in damages against Murphy-Brown LLC. The verdict included $75 million each in punitive damages, plus $3–$5 million in compensatory damages for loss of enjoyment in their properties. A recently enacted state law capping punitive damages will lower that amount to $94 million. The plaintiffs had filed suit for "stench odor, truck noise and flies generated near their homes on Kinlaw Farm in [[Bladen County, North Carolina|Bladen County]]."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://legalnewsline.com/stories/511524185-ag-and-state-reps-say-nuisance-lawyers-trying-to-put-farmers-out-of-business|title=Ag and state reps say nuisance lawyers trying to put farmers out of business|last=Sammon|first=John|date=2018-08-07|work=Legal NewsLine|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State representatives of agriculture in North Carolina accused lawyers and their plaintiffs of attempting to put farmers out of business. Steve Troxler, North Carolina's agricultural commissioner, said the litigation could harm farm production across the country. Troxler said, “One big problem is the use of the term ‘nuisance.’ I’d say just about anything could be a nuisance to someone at any point in time." Troxler said legal abuse of the word nuisance is a mounting concern.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Legal and labor issues==
===Working conditions===
[[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) issued a 175-page report in 2005 documenting what it said were unsafe work conditions in the U.S. meat and poultry industry, citing working conditions at Smithfield Foods as an example.&lt;ref name=HRW2/&gt;{{rp|88ff}} In particular, the report said, workers make thousands of repetitive motions with knives during each shift, leading to lacerations and repetitive strain injuries. It also alleged that the workers' immigrant status may be exploited to prevent them from making complaints or forming unions.&lt;ref name=HRW1&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2005/01/24/abuses-against-workers-taint-us-meat-and-poultry "Abuses Against Workers Taint U.S. Meat and Poultry"], Human Rights Watch, January 25, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HRW2&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/usa0105/usa0105.pdf ''Blood, Sweat and Fear: Workers' Rights in U.S. Meat and Poultry Plants''], Human Rights Watch, January 25, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Deptolla/&gt;{{rp|8}} According to the report, the speed at which the pigs are killed and processed makes the job inherently dangerous for workers. A Smithfield manager testified in 1998, during an unfair labor practices trial, that at the [[Tar Heel, North Carolina|Tar Heel]] plant in North Carolina it takes 5–10 minutes to slaughter and complete the process of "disassembly" of an animal, including draining, cleaning, and cleaving. One worker told HRW that the disassembly line moves so fast that there is no time to sharpen the knives, which means harder cuts have to be made, with the resultant injuries to workers.&lt;ref name=HRW2/&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref&gt;For a Smithfield manager's description of the process, see [https://www.hrw.org/node/11869/section/11 "Appendix A: The Production Process in Meat and Poultry Plants"], ''Blood, Sweat and Fear'', Human Rights Watch, January 25, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar criticism was made by other groups about Smithfield facilities in Poland and Romania.&lt;ref name=Deptolla/&gt;{{rp|8}}

===Union dispute===
[[File:John Edwards meets with Smithfield Foods workers (676317075).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[John Edwards]] meets Smithfield workers, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, June 2007.]]
The Smithfield Packing plant in Tar Heel, North Carolina, was the site of a 15-year dispute between the company and the [[United Food and Commercial Workers Union]] (UFCW), which had tried since the early 1990s to organize the plant's roughly 5,000 hourly workers.&lt;ref name=Maher&gt;Maher, Kris. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119725268618018954 "Firms Use RICO to Fight Union Tactics]," ''Wall Street Journal,'' December 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Workers voted against the union in 1994 and 1997, but the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) alleged that unfair election conduct had occurred and ordered a new election. During the 1997 election the company is alleged to have fired workers who supported the union, stationed police at the plant gates, and threatened plant closures. In 2000, according to Human Rights Watch, Smithfield set up its own security force, with "special police agency" status under North Carolina law, and in 2003 arrested workers who supported the union.&lt;ref name=HRW2/&gt;{{rp|94}}&lt;ref name=HRW1/&gt;

Smithfield appealed the NLRB's ruling that the 1997 election was invalid, and, in 2006, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found in favor of the NLRB.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070522032929/http://www.smithfield.com/news/articles/062006_statement.php "Statement on NLRB decision"], Smithfield Packing Company, June 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; After demonstrations, lockouts, and a shareholder meeting that was disrupted by shareholders supporting the union, the union called for a boycott of Smithfield products. In 2007 Smithfield countered by filing a federal [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO Act]] lawsuit against the union.&lt;ref name=Maher/&gt; The following year Smithfield and the union reached an agreement, under which the union agreed to suspend its boycott in return for the company dropping its RICO lawsuit and allowing another election. In December 2008, workers voted 2,041 to 1,879 in favor of joining the union.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhouse, Steven.

===Justice Department penalty===
In 2009 Smithfield was assessed a $900,000&amp;nbsp;penalty by the [[U.S. Justice Department]] to settle charges that the company had engaged in illegal merger activity during its takeover of [[Premium Standard Farms]] LLC in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/smithfield-foods-and-premium-standard-farms-charged-illegal-premerger-coordination "Smithfield Foods and Premium Standard Farms Charged with Illegal Premerger Coordination"], United States Department of Justice, January 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6831">'''Telecommunications traffic engineering''', '''teletraffic engineering''', or '''traffic engineering''' is the application of traffic engineering theory to [[telecommunications]]. Teletraffic engineers use their knowledge of [[statistics]] including [[queuing theory]], the nature of traffic, their practical models, their measurements and [[Network traffic simulation|simulations]] to make predictions and to plan telecommunication networks such as a [[telephone network]] or the [[Internet]]. These tools and knowledge help provide reliable service at lower cost.

The field was created by the work of [[Agner Krarup Erlang|A. K. Erlang]] for [[circuit switching|circuit-switched]] networks but is applicable to [[packet-switched network]]s, as they both exhibit [[Markov property|Markovian]] properties, and can hence be modeled by e.g. a [[Poisson process|Poisson]] arrival process.

The crucial observation in traffic engineering is that in large systems the [[law of large numbers]] can be used to make the aggregate properties of a system over a long period of time much more predictable than the behaviour of individual parts of the system.

== In PSTN architectures ==

The [[traffic measurement (telecommunications)|measurement]] of traffic in a [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) allows network operators to determine and maintain the [[quality of service]] (QoS) and in particular the [[grade of service]] (GoS) that they promise their subscribers. The [[network performance|performance of a network]] depends on whether all origin-destination pairs are receiving a satisfactory service.

Networks are handled as:
*'''loss systems''', where calls that cannot be handled are given equipment busy tone, or
*'''queuing systems''', where calls that cannot be handled immediately are queued.

Congestion is defined as the situation when exchanges or circuit groups are inundated with calls and are unable to serve all the subscribers. Special attention must be given to ensure that such high loss situations do not arise. To help determine the probability of congestion occurring, operators should use the [[erlang (unit)|Erlang formula]]s or the [[Engset calculation]].

Exchanges in the PSTN make use of [[trunking]] concepts to help minimize the cost of the equipment to the operator. Modern switches generally have [[limited availability|full availability]] and do not make use of grading concepts.

Overflow systems make use of alternative [[routing in the PSTN|routing]] circuit groups or paths to transfer excess traffic and thereby reduce the possibility of congestion.

A very important component in PSTNs is the [[Signalling System No. 7|SS7 network]] used to route signalling traffic. As a supporting network, it carries all the signalling messages necessary to set up, break down or provide extra services. The signalling enables the PSTN to control the manner in which traffic is routed from one location to another.

Transmission and switching of calls is performed using the principle of [[time-division multiplexing]] (TDM). TDM allows multiple calls to be transmitted along the same physical path, reducing the cost of infrastructure.

== In call centers ==

A good example of the use of teletraffic theory in practice is in the design and management of a [[call center]]. Call centers use teletraffic theory to increase the efficiency of their services and overall profitability through calculating how many operators are really needed at each time of the day.

Queueing systems used in call centers have been studied as a science. For example, completed calls are put on hold and queued until they can be served by an operator. If callers are made to wait too long, they may lose patience and default from the queue (hang up), resulting in no service being provided.

== In broadband networks==

Teletraffic Engineering is a well-understood discipline in the traditional voice network, where traffic patterns are established, growth rates can be predicted, and vast amounts of detailed historical data are available for analysis. However, in modern [[broadband networks]], the teletraffic engineering methodologies used for voice networks are inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnx.org/content/m13376/latest/ What is the role of teletraffic engineering in broadband networks? by Jones Kalunga] cnx.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Long-tail traffic ==

Of great importance is the possibility that extremely infrequent occurrences are more likely than anticipated. This situation is known as [[long-tail traffic]]. In some designs, the network might be required to withstand the unanticipated traffic.

==Teletraffic economics and forecasting==

As mentioned in the introduction, the purpose of teletraffic theory is to reduce cost in telecommunications networks. An important tool in achieving this goal is [[Telecommunications forecasting|forecasting]]. Forecasting allows network operators to calculate the potential cost of a new network / service for a given QoS during the [[Network design|planning and design]] stage, thereby ensuring that costs are kept to a minimum.

An important method used in forecasting is [[Network traffic simulation|simulation]], which is described as the most common quantitative modelling technique in use today. An important reason for this is that computing power has become far more accessible, making simulation the preferred analytical method for problems that are not easily solved mathematically.

As in any business environment, network operators must charge [[Tariffing|tariffs]] for their services. These charges must be balanced with the supplied QoS. When operators supply services internationally, this is described as [[trade in services]] and is governed by the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] (GATS).

==History==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
The theory of thermoresponsive polymer (similarly, microgels) begins in the 1940's with work from Flory and Huggins who both independently produced similar theoretical expectations for polymer in solution with varying temperature. 

The effects of external stimuli on particular polymers were investigated in the 1960s by Heskins and Guillet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/10601326808051910|author1=Michael Heskins |author2=James E. Guillet |title=Solution Properties of Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)|journal=J. Macromol. Sci. Chem.|year=1968|volume=2|issue=8|pages=1441–1455}}&lt;/ref&gt; They established 32&amp;nbsp;°C as the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) for [[Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)|poly(N-isopropyl arylamide)]].

==Coil-globule transition==
{{main|Coil-globule transition}}
Thermoresponsive polymer chains in solution adopt an expanded coil conformation. At the phase separation temperature they collapse to form compact globuli. This process can be observed directly by methods of static and dynamic light scattering.&lt;ref&gt;C. Wu, X. Wang, ''Globule-to-Coil Transition of a Single Homopolymer Chain in Solution'', Physical Review Letters, 1998, Volume 80, pp 4092–4094.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Vshivkov, A. P. Safronov, ''The conformational coil-globule transition of polystyrene in cyclohexane solution'', Macromolecular Chemistry and Physics, 1997, Volume 198, 3015.&lt;/ref&gt; The drop in [[viscosity]] can be indirectly observed. When mechanisms which reduce surface tension are absent, the globules aggregate, subsequently causing turbidity and the formation of visible particles.

==Phase diagrams of thermoresponsive polymers==
The phase separation temperature (and hence, the cloud point) is dependent on polymer concentration. Therefore, temperature-composition diagrams are used to display thermoresponsive behavior over a wide range of concentrations.&lt;ref name="Polymer Phase Diagrams"&gt;Ronald Koningsveld, Walter H. Stockmayer, Erik Nies, ''Polymer Phase Diagrams'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0198556350}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Phases separate into a polymer-poor and a polymer-rich phase. In strictly binary mixtures the composition of the coexisting phases can be determined by drawing tie-lines. However, since polymers display a molar mass distribution this straightforward approach may be insufficient.
During the process of phase separation the polymer-rich phase can vitrify before equilibrium is reached. This depends on the [[glass transition temperature]] for each individual composition. It is convenient to add the glass transition curve to the phase diagram, although it is no real equilibrium. The intersection of the glass transition curve with the cloud point curve is called Berghmans point.&lt;ref name="Non-ionic Thermoresponsive Polymers in Water"&gt;V. Aseyev, H. Tenhu, F. M. Winnik, ''Non-ionic Thermoresponsive Polymers in Water'', Advances Polymer Science, 2010, Volume 242,pp 29-89.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of UCST polymers, above the Berghmans point the phases separate into two liquid phases, below this point into a liquid polymer-poor phase and a vitrified polymer-rich phase. For LCST polymers the inverse behavior is observed.

==Thermodynamics==
Polymers dissolve in a solvent when the [[Gibbs energy]] of the system decreases, i.e., the change of Gibbs energy (ΔG) is negative. From the known [[Legendre transformation]] of the [[Gibbs–Helmholtz equation]] it follows that ΔG is determined by the [[enthalpy]] of mixing (ΔH) and [[entropy]] of mixing (ΔS).

&lt;math&gt;\Delta G_{mix}=\Delta H_{mix}-T\cdot\Delta S_{mix}&lt;/math&gt;

Without [[interactions]] between the compounds there would be no enthalpy of mixing and the entropy of mixing would be ideal. The ideal entropy of mixing of multiple pure compounds is always positive (the term -T∙ΔS is negative) and ΔG would be negative for all compositions, causing complete miscibility. Therefore, the fact that miscibility gaps are observed can only be explained by interaction. In the case of polymer solutions, polymer-polymer, solvent-solvent and polymer-solvent interactions have to be taken into account. A model for the phenomenological description of polymer phase diagrams was developed by Flory and Huggins (see [[Flory–Huggins solution theory]]). The resulting equation for the change of Gibbs energy consists of a term for the entropy of mixing for polymers and an interaction parameter that describes the sum of all interactions.&lt;ref name="Polymer Phase Diagrams"/&gt;[[File:Temperature dependence of interaction parameter x.tif|thumb|LCST or UCST behavior resulting from the temperature dependence of the interaction parameter]]

&lt;math&gt;\frac {\Delta G_{mix}} {RT}= \frac {\phi_1} m_1 ln\phi_1+ \frac {\phi_2} m_2 ln\phi_2+\chi \phi_1\phi_2&lt;/math&gt;

* m = number of occupied lattice sites per molecule (for polymer solutions m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is approximately equal to the [[degree of polymerization]] and m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=1)
* φ = [[volume fraction]] of the polymer and the solvent, respectively
* χ = interaction parameter

A consequence of the Flory-Huggins theory is, for instance, that the UCST (if it exists) increases and shifts into the solvent-rich region when the molar mass of the polymer increases. Whether a polymer shows LCST and/or UCST behavior can be derived from the temperature-dependence of the interaction parameter (see figure). It has to be noted that the interaction parameter not only comprises enthalpic contributions but also the non-ideal entropy of mixing, which again consists of many individual contributions (e.g., the strong [[hydrophobic effect]] in aqueous solutions). For these reasons, classical Flory-Huggins theory cannot provide much insight into the molecular origin of miscibility gaps.

==Applications==

===Bioseparation===
[[File:Cell culture on PNIPAM.svg|thumb|Adhesion of cells on a surface coated with a thermoresponsive polymer. Displayed is a polymer with [[LCST]]]]
Thermoresponsive polymers can be functionalized with moieties that bind to specific biomolecules. The polymer-biomolecule conjugate can be precipitated from solution by a small change of temperature.&lt;ref name = "Smart Polymers for Bioseparation and Bioprocessing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jing Ping Chen, Allan S. Hoffman, ''Polymer-Protein Conjugates II. Affinity precipitation separation of human immunogammaglobulin by a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-protein A conjugate'', Biomaterials, 1990, Volume 11, pp 631-634.&lt;/ref&gt; Isolation may be achieved by filtration or centrifugation.

===Thermoresponsive surfaces===

====Tissue engineering====
For some polymers it was demonstrated that thermoresponsive behavior can be transferred to surfaces. The surface is either coated with a polymer film or the polymer chains are bound covalently to the surface.
This provides a way to control the wetting properties of a surface by small temperature changes. The described behavior can be exploited in [[tissue engineering]] since the adhesion of cells is strongly dependent on the [[hydrophilicity]]/[[hydrophobicity]].&lt;ref name="Thermoresponsive Polymers for Biomedical Applications"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CM and PNIPAAm"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=EL.|author2=von Recum, HA|title=Cell culture platform with mechanical conditioning and nondamaging cellular detachment|journal=J Biomed Mater Res A|year=2010|volume=93|issue=2|pages=411–8|url=http://openurl.ebscohost.com/linksvc/linking.aspx?genre=article&amp;sid=PubMed&amp;issn=1549-3296&amp;title=J%20Biomed%20Mater%20Res%20A&amp;volume=93&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=411&amp;atitle=Cell%20culture%20platform%20with%20mechanical%20conditioning%20and%20nondamaging%20cellular%20detachment.&amp;aulast=Lee&amp;date=2010|pmid=20358641}}&lt;/ref&gt; This way, it is possible to detach cells from a cell culture dish by only small changes in temperature, without the need to additionally use enzymes (see figure). Respective commercial products are already available.

====Chromatography====
{{main|Thermoresponsive polymers in chromatography}}
Thermoresponsive polymers can be used as the stationary phase in [[liquid chromatography]].&lt;ref name="Thermoresponsive polymers in liquid chromatography"/&gt; Here, the polarity of the stationary phase can be varied by temperature changes, altering the power of separation without changing the column or solvent composition. Thermally related benefits of gas chromatography can now be applied to classes of compounds that are restricted to liquid chromatography due to their thermolability. In place of solvent gradient elution, thermoresponsive polymers allow the use of temperature gradients under purely aqueous isocratic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/jssc.200700093|author=Hideko Kanazawa|title=Thermally responsive chromatographic materials using functional polymers|journal=J.

Sci.|year=2006|volume=29|issue=6|pages=738–749|pmid=16830486}}&lt;/ref&gt; These developments have already brought major improvements to the fields of hydrophobic interaction chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, and affinity chromatography separations, as well as pseudo-solid phase extractions ("pseudo" because of phase transitions).

===Thermoresponsive gels===
==== Covalently linked gels ====
Three-dimensional covalently linked polymer networks are insoluble in all solvents, they merely swell in good solvents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Covalent amphiphilic polymer networks|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359029403000050|journal = Current Opinion in Colloid &amp; Interface Science|date = 2003-03-01|pages = 76–85|volume = 8|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/S1359-0294(03)00005-0|first = Costas S.|last = Patrickios|first2 = Theoni K.|last2 = Georgiou}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 6.08 - Model Networks and Functional Conetworks|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444533494001667|publisher = Elsevier|date = 2012-01-01|location = Amsterdam|isbn = 978-0-08-087862-1|pages = 293–308|doi = 10.1016/b978-0-444-53349-4.00166-7|first = M.|last = Rikkou-Kalourkoti|first2 = C.

==== Physical gels ====
In physical gels unlike covalently linked gels the polymers chains are not covalently linked together. That means that the gel could re-dissolve in a good solvent under some conditions. Thermoresponsive physical gels, also sometimes called thermoresponsive injectable gels have been used in Tissue Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Injectable matrices and scaffolds for drug delivery in tissue engineering|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169409X07000282|journal = Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews|date = 2007-05-30|pages = 263–273|volume = 59|series = Matrices and Scaffolds for Drug Delivery in Tissue Engineering|issue = 4–5|doi = 10.1016/j.addr.2007.03.013|pmid = 17507111|first = James D.|last = Kretlow|first2 = Leda|last2 = Klouda|first3 = Antonios G.|last3 = Mikos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Thermoresponsive hydrogels in biomedical applications|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939641107002470|journal = European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics|date = 2008-01-01|pmc = 3163097|pmid = 17881200|pages = 34–45|volume = 68|series = Interactive Polymers for Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Applications|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.ejpb.2007.02.025|first = Leda|last = Klouda|first2 = Antonios G.|last2 = Mikos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Thermoresponsive hydrogels in biomedical applications: A seven-year update|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939641115002490|journal = European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics|date = 2015-11-01|pages = 338–349|volume = 97, Part B|series = Polymers for Drug Delivery Systems|doi = 10.1016/j.ejpb.2015.05.017|first = Leda|last = Klouda}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Thermoresponsive Polymers for Biomedical Applications|url = http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/3/3/1215|journal = Polymers|date = 2011-08-03|pages = 1215–1242|volume = 3|issue = 3|doi = 10.3390/polym3031215|first = Mark A.|last = Ward|first2 = Theoni K.|last2 = Georgiou}}&lt;/ref&gt; This involves mixing at room temperature the thermoresponsive polymer in solution with the cells and then inject the solution to the body.

==Characterization of thermoresponsive polymer solutions ==

===Cloud point===
Experimentally, the phase separation can be followed by [[turbidimetry]]. There is no universal approach for determining the [[cloud point]] suitable for all systems. It is often defined as the temperature at the onset of cloudiness, the temperature at the inflection point of the transmittance curve, or the temperature at a defined transmittance (e.g., 50%).&lt;ref name="Non-ionic Thermoresponsive Polymers in Water"/&gt; The cloud point can be affected by many structural parameters of the polymer like the hydrophobic content,&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = "Comb-like" non-ionic polymeric macrosurfactants|url = http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=b926822g|journal = Soft Matter|volume = 6|issue = 10|pages = 2321|doi = 10.1039/b926822g|first = Norsadiah H.|last = Raduan|first2 = Tommy S.|last2 = Horozov|first3 = Theoni K.|last3 = Georgiou|year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; architecture&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; and even the molar mass.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Georgiou 2221–2229"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Nanoscopic Cationic Methacrylate Star Homopolymers:  Synthesis by Group Transfer Polymerization, Characterization and Evaluation as Transfection Reagents|url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bm049755e|journal = Biomacromolecules|date = 2004-09-10|pages = 2221–2229|volume = 5|issue = 6|doi = 10.1021/bm049755e|pmid = 15530036|first = Theoni K.|last = Georgiou|first2 = Maria|last2 = Vamvakaki|first3 = Costas S.|last3 = Patrickios|first4 = Edna N.|last4 = Yamasaki|first5 = Leonidas A.|last5 = Phylactou}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hysteresis===
The cloud points upon cooling and heating of a thermoresponsive polymer solution do not coincide because the process of equilibration takes time. The temperature interval between the cloud points upon cooling and heating is called hysteresis. The cloud points are dependent on the cooling and heating rates, and hysteresis decreases with lower rates. There are indications that hysteresis is influenced by the temperature, [[viscosity]], [[glass transition temperature]] and the ability to form additional intra- and inter-molecular [[hydrogen bonds]] in the phase separated state.&lt;ref name="Polymers with Upper Critical Solution Temperature in Aqueous Solution"&gt;Jan Seuring, Seema Agarwal, ''Polymers with Upper Critical Solution Temperature in Aqueous Solution'', Macromolecular Rapid Communications, 2012, Volume 33, pp 1898-1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other properties===
Another important property for potential applications is the extent of phase separation, represented by the difference in polymer content in the two phases after phase separation. For most applications, phase separation in pure polymer and pure solvent would be desirable although it is practically impossible. The extent of phase separation in a given temperature interval depends on the particular polymer-solvent phase diagram.

''Example'': From the phase diagram of polystyrene (molar mass 43,600 g/mol) in the solvent cyclohexane it follows that at a total polymer concentration of 10%, cooling from 25 to 20&amp;nbsp;°C causes phase separation into a polymer-poor phase with  1% polymer and a polymer-rich phase with 30% polymer content.&lt;ref name="Phase Equilibria in Polymer-Solvent Systems"&gt;A. R. Schultz, P. J. Flory, ''Phase Equilibria in Polymer-Solvent Systems'', Journal of the American Chemical Society, 1952, Volume 74, pp 4760–4767.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also desirable for many applications is a sharp phase transition, which is reflected by a sudden drop in transmittance. The sharpness of the phase transition is related to the extent of phase separation but additionally relies on whether all present polymer chains exhibit the same cloud point. This depends on the polymer endgroups, dispersity, or—in the case of [[copolymers]]—varying copolymer compositions.&lt;ref name="Polymers with Upper Critical Solution Temperature in Aqueous Solution"/&gt;

==Examples of thermoresponsive polymers==

===Thermoresponsivity in organic solvents===

===Thermoresponsivity in water===
Polymer solutions that show thermoresponsivity in water are especially important since water as a solvent is cheap, safe and biologically relevant. Current research efforts focus on water-based applications like drug delivey systems, tissue engineering, bioseparation (see the section [[Temperature-responsive polymer#Applications|Applications]]). Numerous polymers with LCST in water are known.&lt;ref name="Non-ionic Thermoresponsive Polymers in Water"/&gt; The most studied polymer is [[poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)|poly(''N''-isopropylacrylamide)]].&lt;ref&gt;S.

Some industrially relevant polymers show LCST as well as UCST behavior whereas the UCST is found outside the 0-to-100&amp;nbsp;°C region and can only be observed under extreme experimental conditions.&lt;ref name="Polymers with Upper Critical Solution Temperature in Aqueous Solution"/&gt; Examples are [[polyethylene oxide]],&lt;ref&gt;G.

However, there are large differences concerning the ionic strength at which UCST behavior is detected.

Small amounts of ionic groups may suppress phase separation in pure water.

It should be noted that the UCST is dependent on the molecular mass of the polymer. For the LCST this is not necessarily the case, as shown for poly(''N''-isopropylacrylamide).&lt;ref&gt;Karel Solc, Karel Dusek, Ronald Koningsveld, Hugo Berghmans, ''"Zero and Off-Zero Critical Concentrations in Solutions of Polydisperse Polymers with Very High Molar Masses'', Collection of Czechoslovak Chemical Communications, 1995, Volume 60, pp 1661-1688.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fatema Afroze, Erik Nies, Hugo Berghmans, ''Phase transitions in the system poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)/water and swelling behaviour of the corresponding networks'', Journal of Molecular Structure, 2000, Volume 554, pp 55-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1830">'''Transparency in Armaments''' (TIA) is an [[arms control]] reporting program established by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on December 9, 1991 under UN resolution 46/36L.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defense Threat Reduction Agency, Defense Treaty Inspection Readiness Program |url=http://dtirp.dtra.mil/TIC/synopses/untia.aspx|publisher=[[Defense Treaty Ready Inspection Readiness Program]]|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federation of American Scientists, Weapons of Mass Destruction, Transparency in Armaments |url=http://www.fas.org/nuke/control/untia/|publisher=Fas.org|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It calls for annual reporting by UN member states on imports, exports, and holdings of weapons in seven categories: battle tanks; armored combat vehicles; large caliber artillery systems; attack helicopters; combat aircraft; warships; and missiles and missile launchers.  Reporting is not required but is strongly encouraged.  Reports are sent to the [[Secretary General of the United Nations]] and are maintained in the United Nations Conventional Arms Register (UNCAR).

Reporting has not been consistent.  At least 170 member states and three non-member states have reported at least once since reporting began.  However, in 2010, only 72 national reports were received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations, Office of Disarmament Affairs, Fact Sheet|url= https://www.un.org/disarmament/convarms/Register/DOCS/20110201-RegisterFactsheet.pdf|publisher=Un.org|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The highest rate of compliance is by nations that are members of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), because the data required by TIA is comparable to that required by other OSCE [[arms control]] initiatives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6745">'''Transport standards organisations''' is an article transport [[Standards organisation]]s, consortia and groups that are involved in producing and maintaining standards that are relevant to the global transport technology, transport journey planning and transport ticket/retailing industry. Transport systems are inherently distributed systems with complex information requirements. Robust modern [[Technical standard|standards]] for transport data are important for the safe and efficient operation of transport systems. These include:

*Formal standards development organisations;
*Other international bodies developing definitive core specifications;
*Other important international bodies;
*Other National bodies developing definitive core specifications;
*Other important National bodies

== Formal standards development organisations ==
The formal development of international standards is organised in three tiers of [[Standards Organisations|Standards Development Organisations]], recognised by international agreements :

* ''World:'' [[International Organisation for Standardisation]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]].
* ''Regional'' Regional Standards bodies coordinate standardisation between geographically or politically connected regions with a need to harmonise products and practices. For example, in Europe, the [[European Committee for Standardisation]] or [[European Committee for Standardisation|CEN]]
* ''National'', e.g. Most Nations have a coordinating body responsible for organizing participation in CEN &amp; ISO activities, for publishing ISO &amp; CEN standards within the country, and for coordinating national standardisation activities. The National SDO in turn will delegate responsibility as appropriate to the relevant trade associations, government departments and other stakeholders for a specific are of technical expertise.  For example, in the UK the  [[British Standards Institution]] or [[British Standards Institution|BSI]] is the National SDO.

The SDOs conduct their work through a system of working groups, responsible for different areas of expertise. These evolve over time to accommodate changes in technology. key current working groups for transport standards are outlined below.

===CEN Working Groups and leaders for Transport Standards===
CEN Allocates responsibility for different areas of transport standardisation to working groups

* WG1 -	Automatic Fee Collection and Access Control	-CEN
* WG2 - Freight and Fleet Management System	- ISO
* WG3 - Public Transport	- ISO

* WG10 - Man-machine Interface -	n/a
* WG11 - Subsystem- Intersystem Interfaces -	ISO
* WG12 - Automatic Vehicle and Equipment Identification -	CEN
* WG13 - System Architecture and Terminology -	ISO

===ISO Working Groups and leaders for Transport Standards===

ISO Technical Committee 204 is responsible for ''Transport Information and Control Systems''. It has a number of standing Working Groups, which set up Subgroups from time to time.

Current ISO TC204 Working Groups, Work program &amp; Countries that provide Secretariat are as follows

* WG1	Architecture	- UK
* WG2	Quality and Reliability Requirements	- Japan
* WG3	TICS Database Technology	- Japan
