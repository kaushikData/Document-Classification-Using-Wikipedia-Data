[[Acehnese language|Acehnese]] has a large [[vowel]] inventory, with ten oral [[monophthong]] vowels,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pillai|Yusuf|2012|p=1030}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Asyik|1987|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; twelve oral [[diphthong]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pillai|Yusuf|2012|p=1031}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Asyik|1987|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; seven [[Nasal vowel|nasal]] monophthong vowels,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pillai|Yusuf|2012|p=1032}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Asyik|1987|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and five nasal diphthongs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pillai|Yusuf|2012|p=1032}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Asyik|1987|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vowels==

Native-speaking linguists divide vowels in Acehnese into several categories: oral monophthongs, oral diphthongs (which are further divided into the ones ending with /ə/ and with /i/), nasal monophthongs, and nasal diphthongs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pillai|Yusuf|2012|p=1031}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Asyik|1987|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notes:
*Syllable-final k always represents /ʔ/ save in certain recent loans
*/f/, /z/, and /ʃ/ are borrowed sounds, and are often replaced by /ph/, /dh/, and /ch/ respectively
*/mb/, /nd/, /ɲɟ/, and /ŋɡ/ are also known as "funny nasals"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Asyik|1982|p=2}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Lawler|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sound-spelling correspondences==

In addition to the modern 26 letter [[ISO basic Latin alphabet|basic Latin alphabet]], Acehnese uses the supplementary letters è, é, ë, ô, and ö, making a total of 31 letters in its orthography.

[[Image:MeridianDunedin.jpg|thumb|right|[[Meridian Mall]] in [[Dunedin]], with the logos of the two anchor tenants, [[Kmart New Zealand]] and [[Arthur Barnett (department store)|Arthur Barnett]] displayed on the upper walls]]

In [[retail]], an "'''anchor tenant'''", sometimes called an "'''anchor store'''", "'''draw tenant'''", or "'''key tenant'''", is a considerably larger tenant in a [[shopping mall]], often a [[department store]] or [[Chain store|retail chain]]. With their broad appeal, they are intended to attract a significant cross-section of the shopping public to the center. They are often offered steep discounts on rent in exchange for signing long-term leases, in order to provide steady cash flows for the mall owners.

== Origins ==
When the planned shopping centre format was developed by [[Victor Gruen]] in the early to mid-1950s, signing larger department stores was necessary for the financial stability of the projects, and to draw retail traffic that would result in visits to the smaller shops in the centre as well.  Anchors generally have their rents heavily discounted, and may even receive cash inducements from the centre to remain open.

Early on, [[grocery store]]s were a common type of anchor store, since they are visited often.  However, research on consumer behavior revealed that most trips to the grocery store did not result in visits to surrounding shops. Large supermarkets remain common anchor stores within [[Power center (retail)|power centers]] however.

As of 2005, the declining popularity of old-line department stores makes&lt;!-- subject is "popularity", not stores. --&gt; it necessary for mall management companies to consider re-anchoring with other retail alternatives, or mix commercial development with residential development to guarantee a {{clarify|text=captive clientele.|date=October 2015}}

The challenges faced by the traditional large department stores have led to a resurgence in the use of supermarkets&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Kroll |first=Karen M. |date=February 1999 |title=Industry turns to supermarket anchors to fill big boxes |url=http://www.icsc.org/srch/sct/sct9902/02.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923212001/http://www.icsc.org/srch/sct/sct9902/02.php |archivedate=23 September 2009 |work=Shopping Centers Today |access-date=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even [[Health club|gyms]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/malls-never-wanted-gyms-now-they-court-them-1511697600?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_content%3B3h8GOOyuRjCeKbrdxa4IPw%3D%3D|title=Malls Never Wanted Gyms. Now They Court Them|author=Rachel Bachman|date=2017-11-27|publisher=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; as anchors.

== Classification ==
The [[International Council of Shopping Centers]] makes the presence of anchors one of the main defining characteristics of the two largest categories of centres, the ''regional center'' with 400,000 to {{convert|800000|sqft|m2}} in [[gross leasable area]], and the ''superregional center'' with more than {{convert|800000|sqft|m2}} of space.

The ''regional center'' typically has two or more anchors, while the superregional typically has three or more.

In each case, the anchors account for 50–70% of the centre's leasable space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icsc.org/srch/lib/SCDefinitions99.pdf "ICSC Shopping Center Definitions: Basic Configurations and Types for the United States"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621081346/http://www.icsc.org/srch/lib/SCDefinitions99.pdf |date=2007-06-21 }}, [[International Council of Shopping Centers]]. Accessed July 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
Shopping centres with anchor stores have consistently outperformed those without one, as the anchor helps draw shoppers initially attracted to the anchor to shop at other shops in the mall.&lt;ref&gt;Stoffel, Jennifer. [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/07/business/what-s-new-in-shopping-malls-putting-a-bloomingdale-s-in-towns-big-and-small.html "WHAT'S NEW IN SHOPPING MALLS; Putting a Bloomingdale's in Towns Big and Small"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 7, 1988. Accessed July 10, 2008. "Even as department stores have lost ground to smaller specialty shops, shopping centers with national retailers as anchors continue to outperform those that have only local tenants.... The anchor store has substantial influence - mall plans have been held up until an anchor is firmly in place, and a successful anchor can inspire new development or continued expansion."&lt;/ref&gt;

The translation of the [[Bible]] into the [[Manchu language]] was started in the 18th century, but only the translation of the [[New Testament]] has been published.

==de Poirot translation==
The Jesuit scholar and painter at the court of the [[Qianlong Emperor]], [[Louis Antoine de Poirot]] (1735–1813), made a translation of the [[Old Testament]] into Manchu some time before 1790, but this translation was never published. A copy of the translation is preserved in the library of the British and Foreign Bible Society in London.&lt;ref name="orthodoxy"&gt;{{Cite web | title=The New Testament of Our Lord Jesus Christ | url=http://orthodox.cn/bible/manchu/ | publisher=Orthodoxy in China | accessdate=2013-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lipovtsov-Borrow translation==
The first published translation of the Bible into Manchu was made by Stepan Vaciliyevich Lipovtsov [Степан Васильевич Липовцов] (1770–1841). Lipovtsov had been a member of the eighth Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Beijing from 1794 to 1807, where he had learned Manchu, and was later a member of the Russian Foreign Office. The [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] commissioned Lipovtsov to translate the [[Gospel of Matthew]] into Manchu.{{cn|date=January 2015}} In 1822, 550 copies of the translated Gospel of Matthew were printed in [[Saint Petersburg]]; however, most of these were destroyed in a flood.&lt;ref name="watchtower"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=An Intrepid "Wanderer in the Gospel’s Cause" | journal=[[The Watchtower]] | pages=27–29 | date=15 August 2004 | url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2004606 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1833 the British and Foreign Bible Society sent [[George Borrow]] (1803–1881) to Russia to supervise the completion of the translation of the New Testament into Manchu. Borrow learned Manchu in six months using Lipovtsov's translation and a Manchu-French dictionary. Within two years Lipovtsov and Borrow had completed the translation of the New Testament, and in 1835, 1,000 copies were printed in Saint Petersburg. Borrow wanted to go to China to distribute the translation, but the Russian authorities refused to let him take the Bible with him in case it damaged diplomatic relations between Russia and China. It was not until ten years later that the translation made its way to China. In 1859, parallel Chinese and Manchu translations of the Gospels of Matthew and Mark were printed in China, but by then Manchu was no longer a widely spoken language.&lt;ref name="watchtower"/&gt; A reprint of the Manchu translation of the New Testament was made in Shanghai in 1929.&lt;ref name="orthodoxy"/&gt;

A [[translation]] of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] was made in the 19th century. This was in [[Arabic script]] and was probably not widely distributed.

[[Institute for Bible Translation|IBT]] has published both the [[New Testament]] and several [[Old Testament]] books&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibtrussia.org/en/media?id=TKM/latn IBT downloads]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Turkmen language]], as well as a more recent complete translation of the Bible. The first recent publication was in 1994 and was of the New Testament (the 'Injil'), [[Psalms]] ('Zebur') and [[Book of Proverbs | Proverbs]] (Suleyman's Tymsals) in one [[Hardcover | hardback]] volume. This edition was presented to the Language and Literature department of the Academy of Sciences in [[Ashgabat]] in November 1995 and was generally well received. It was sold widely on book tables throughout Ashgabat. Since then a paperback version of the New Testament was published, and also the [[Torah | Pentateuch]] ('Töwrat'), and a new version of Proverbs. The whole Bible is now available online from on the IBT website [http://www.ibt.org.ru www.ibt.org.ru] and was published in 2016.

{{Wiktionary|brogue}}
The term '''brogue''' ({{IPAc-en|b|r|əʊ|ɡ}} {{respell|BROHG}}) generally refers to an [[Hiberno-English|Irish accent]]. Less commonly, it may also refer to certain other regional forms of English, in particular those of [[Scottish English|Scotland]] or the English [[West Country dialects|West Country]].&lt;ref&gt;''brogue'', noun. Cambridge Dictionaries Online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McArthur, Tom and Roshan (2005). ''Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language''. OUP Oxford. {{ISBN|978-0192806376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was first recorded in 1689.&lt;ref&gt;McCrum, Robert et al. (1986). ''The Story of English''. Viking Press. {{ISBN|978-0670804672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple [[Etymology|etymologies]] have been proposed: it may derive from the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''bróg'' ("shoe"), the [[Brogue shoe|type of shoe]] traditionally worn by the people of Ireland and the [[Scottish Highlands]], and hence possibly originally meant "the speech of those who call a shoe a 'brogue'".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=brogue&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 brogue], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that the term comes from the [[Irish language|Irish]] word ''barróg'', meaning "a hold (on the tongue)", thus "accent" or "speech impediment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=brogue|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwwodarch.pl?Jul.10.2009|work=Merriam-Webster Online|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|accessdate=19 July 2012|author=Merriam-Webster Online|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A famous [[false etymology]] states that the word stems from the supposed perception that the Irish spoke English so peculiarly that it was as if they did so "with a shoe in their mouths".&lt;ref&gt;Walshe, Shane et al. (2009). ''Irish English As Represented in Film''. Peter Lang Pub Inc. p. 4. {{ISBN|978-3631586822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chalcography.PNG|thumb|266px|Chalcography technology, plate of German ''poeta laureatus'' Ambrosius Hannemann (died in 1644)]]

'''Chalcography''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] chalcos, copper and graphia, to write), are engravings on [[copper]] plates used for printmaking and for illustrations in the production of books. The ''[[Monte dei Santi di Dio]]'' by [[Antonio Bettini]] is the most ancient book bearing chalcographies, printed in [[Florence]] on September 10, 1477 from [[Nicolo di Lorenzo Tedesco]]. Its primacy is contested by [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Cosmographia]]'', printed in [[Bologna]] on June 23, 1477 from [[Domenico de' Lapi]], a [[Latin]] translation from [[Jacopo d'Angelo]], containing geographical charts and maps by [[Taddeo Crivelli]], engraved in copper plates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="775">'''Contone''' is a printing method for improving the output quality of printing, usually from laser printers.
Most printing techniques apply [[ink]] or [[toner]] on to the printing surface, usually [[paper]], in a pattern of dots to maximize the range of possible colors.
Contone varies the dot size to achieve a simulation of continuous tone.

The '''Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction''' (CCEP) in Japan was founded in April 1969,&lt;ref name=ccep-about&gt;[http://cais.gsi.go.jp/YOCHIREN/about.e.html#gaiyo About CCEP] CCEP, accessed 2011-03-19&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[Geodesy Council|Geodesy Council's]] Second Earthquake Prediction Plan, in order to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of earthquake data in Japan.&lt;ref name=nas-c&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=5709&amp;page=3781 Geochemical challenge to earthquake prediction] ''Earthquake Prediction: The Scientific Challenge (NAS Colloquium)'', published 1996, accessed 2011-03-19&lt;/ref&gt; The committee consists of 30 members and meets four times each year, as well as publishing a report on its activities twice each year.&lt;ref name=ccep-about /&gt; The CCEP brings together representatives from 20 governmental bodies and universities engaged in [[earthquake prediction]] and research.&lt;ref name=ccep-orgs&gt;[http://cais.gsi.go.jp/YOCHIREN/links.e.html#hoka Organizations with ties to CCEP] CCEP, accessed 2011-03-19&lt;/ref&gt; It has a secretariat within the [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (Japan)|Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cais.gsi.go.jp/YOCHIREN/info.e.html Access] CCEP, accessed 2011-03-19&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first moves towards the Committee were taken after earthquake researchers published ''Earthquake Prediction - Current Status and Action Plan'' in 1962. This was adopted by the General Assembly of Geodesy Council with the launch of their first prediction plan in 1964. Following earthquakes in 1964, 1965 and 1968 the EEPC was founded to coordinate future prediction activities.&lt;ref name=honda-a&gt;[http://cidbimena.desastres.hn/docum/crid/Mayo2004/pdf/spa/doc11817/doc11817.htm Avances en prevención de desastres sísmicos en Japón.

==Geographical Areas of Observation==
In order to focus future work, based on the geological evidence, and as well as the prediction of a [[Tōkai earthquakes|Tōkai earthquake]] in the relatively near future, in 1970, the CCEP designated certain areas of Japan as Areas of Specified Observation or Areas of Intensified Observation.&lt;ref name=nas-c /&gt;&lt;ref name=mogi-2004&gt;[http://www.terrapub.co.jp/journals/EPS/pdf/2004/5608/5608li.pdf Two grave issues concerning the expected Tokai Earthquake] Kiyoo Mogi, ''Earth Planets Space'', Vol. 56 (No. 8), pp. li-lxvi, published 2004, accessed 2011-03-11&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tōkai region]] was upgraded to an Area of Intensified Observation in 1974.&lt;ref name=mogi-2004 /&gt;

By 1978, when some of the boundaries were also changed, eight Areas of Specified Observation and two Areas of Intensified Observation had been designated.&lt;ref name=mogi-2004 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.fr/nsd/workshops/SEIS2004/Papers/Presentations/2ndday/K-6%20Okada.pdf 2004 Mid Niigata earthquake (M6.8) - Quick report], Yoshimitsu Okada, CCED, published 2004-11-16, accessed 2011-03-19&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''denied area''' is an [[espionage|intelligence]] [[term of art]] describing an extremely hostile operational environment with heavy surveillance.&lt;ref name="Redmond"&gt;{{cite book |last=Redmond |first=Paul J. |author-link= |year=2010 |chapter=The Challenges of Counterintelligence |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=X7i_I_np11IC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA545#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |editor-last=Johnson |editor-first=Loch K. |editor1-link=Loch K. Johnson |title=The Oxford Handbook of National Security Intelligence |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X7i_I_np11IC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc. |page=545 |isbn=9780199704699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Defense]] defines a denied area as ''"an area under enemy or unfriendly control in which friendly forces cannot expect to operate successfully within existing operational constraints and force capabilities."''{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

When a reference is made to a friendly force denying an area to the enemy, such as a reference to friendly forces employing area-denial weapons, the intent is to create an area in which the enemy cannot operate without extreme risk.

[[Land mine]]s can be used as area-denial weapons, and some modern semi-autonomous or remotely controlled [[artillery]] units can serve this purpose as well.  In theory, [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]], [[biological weapon|biological]], and [[chemical weapon|chemical]] [[weapons]] can also serve this purpose, for varying lengths of times, though such weapons have not yet been used for this purpose in major [[war]]s, although such weapons have been used for other purposes.

Some effective tactics for creating a denied area do not require a significant continuing commitment of personnel or additional material.  For example, once a minefield is in place, no upkeep is required unless a significant percentage of the mines have been detonated or destroyed—no residual force commitment is required.  This is why a denied area may well exist behind enemy lines when, if it were secured by friendly forces on the ground, it might be considered a forward position.  When hostilities end, these areas can be very dangerous and expensive to clean up, assuming that one of the combatants is willing to. (see [[UXO]], [[bomb disposal]], [[land mine]], and the contamination concerns for [[weapon of mass destruction|unconventional weapons]]).

A [[dirty bomb]] is a potential option for an area denial weapon that might be more accessible to small [[paramilitary]] or [[terrorist groups]].

In the [[formal sciences]], the '''domain of discourse''', also called the '''universe of discourse''', '''[[universe (mathematics)|universal set]]''', or simply '''[[universe (mathematics)|universe]]''', is the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[entities]] over which certain [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s of interest in some [[Mathematical formalism|formal]] treatment may range. 

==Overview==
[[File:Giuseppe Peano.jpg|thumb|[[Giuseppe Peano]]]]
The domain of discourse is usually identified in the preliminaries, so that there is no need in the further treatment to specify each time the range of the relevant variables.&lt;ref&gt;Corcoran, John. ''Universe of discourse''. Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 941.&lt;/ref&gt; Many logicians distinguish, sometimes only tacitly, between the '''domain of a science''' and the '''universe of discourse of a formalization of the science'''.&lt;ref&gt;[[José Miguel Sagüillo]], Domains of sciences, universe of discourse, and omega arguments, History and philosophy of logic, vol. 20 (1999), pp. 267–280.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giuseppe Peano]] formalized number theory (arithmetic of positive integers) taking its domain to be the positive integers and the universe of discourse to include all numbers, not just integers {{citation needed|date=June 2018}}.

==Examples==
For example, in an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of [[first-order logic]], the domain of discourse is the set of individuals over which the [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]] range. A proposition such as {{math|[[Universal quantification|∀]]''x'' (''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≠ 2)}} is ambiguous, if no domain of discourse has been identified. In one interpretation, the domain of discourse could be the set of [[real number]]s; in another interpretation, it could be the set of [[natural number]]s. If the domain of discourse is the set of real numbers, the proposition is false, with {{math|1=''x'' = {{radic|2}}}} as counterexample; if the domain is the set of naturals, the proposition is true, since 2 is not the square of any natural number.

==Universe of discourse==
The term '''''universe of discourse''''' generally refers to the collection of objects being discussed in a specific [[discourse]]. In [[Semantics#Model theoretic semantics|model-theoretical semantics]], a universe of discourse is the set of entities that a model is based on. The concept ''universe of discourse'' is generally attributed to [[Augustus De&amp;nbsp;Morgan]] (1846) but the name was used for the first time by [[George Boole]] (1854) on page 42 of his ''[[The Laws of Thought|Laws of Thought]]''. Boole's definition is quoted below. The concept, probably discovered independently by Boole in 1847, played a crucial role in his philosophy of logic especially in his principle of [[wholistic reference]].

==Boole’s 1854 definition==
[[File:George Boole color.jpg|thumb|[[George Boole]]]]
{{Quote|text=
In every discourse, whether of the mind conversing with its own thoughts, or of the individual in his intercourse with others, there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined. The most unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood in the widest possible application, and for them the limits of discourse are co-extensive with those of the universe itself. But more usually we confine ourselves to a less spacious field. Sometimes, in discoursing of men we imply (without expressing the limitation) that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions that we speak, as of civilized men, or of men in the vigour of life, or of men under some other condition or relation. Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse. Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse. |author=[[George Boole]]|source=&lt;ref&gt;Page 42: [[George Boole]]. 1854/2003. ''The Laws of Thought.'' Facsimile of 1854 edition, with an introduction by J. Corcoran. Buffalo: Prometheus Books (2003). Reviewed by James van Evra in ''Philosophy in Review'' 24 (2004): 167–169.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7472">'''Gaelicisation''', or '''Gaelicization''', is the act or process of making something [[Gaels|Gaelic]], or gaining characteristics of the ''[[Gaels]]''. The [[Gaels]] are an ethno-linguistic group, traditionally viewed as having spread from [[Ireland]] to [[Scotland]] and the [[Isle of Man]].

"Gaelic", as a linguistic term, refers to the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic languages]] but can also refer to the transmission of any other Gaelic cultural feature such as social norms and customs, music and sport.

==Early history==
Examples of Gaelicisation in history include the [[Picts]], [[Hiberno-Norman]]s,&lt;ref name=MacLysaght &gt;{{cite book | first=Edward | last=MacLysaght | title=More Irish Families | publisher=Irish Academic Press | ISBN=0-7165-0126-0 | quote=Some became completely integrated, giving rise to the well known phrase 'Hiberniores Hibernis ipsis' (more Irish than the Irish themselves). These formed septs on the Gaelic-Irish pattern, headed by a chief. | url=http://www.heraldry.ws/info/article06.html | accessdate=2006-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scoto-Norman]]s&lt;ref name=rootsweb&gt;{{cite web|title=Clans and Families of Ireland and Scotland Part 5 X.

==Modern era==
Today, Gaelicisation, or more often re-Gaelicisation, of [[placenames]], [[surnames]] and [[given names]] is often a deliberate effort to help promote the languages and to counteract centuries of [[Anglicisation]].

===Isle of Man===
The [[Manx language]], which is very similar to [[Irish language|Irish]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-29224545 |title=Belfast's role in Manx language revival - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2014-09-16 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; has undergone a major revival very recently,&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21242667 |title=Manx: Bringing a language back from the dead - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-01-31 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the language being so rarely used that it was even mislabelled as extinct by a [[United Nations]] report as recently as 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/isle_of_man/7901763.stm |title=Europe &amp;#124; Isle of Man &amp;#124; UN declares Manx Gaelic 'extinct' |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date=2009-02-20 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decline of the language on the island was primarily as a result of [[stigmatisation]] and high levels of [[emigration]] to [[England]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

There are now primary schools teaching in the medium of Manx Gaelic, after efforts mainly modelled on the Irish system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-29171457 |title=Can Northern Ireland learn lessons from the world's only Manx-speaking school? - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts have been widely praised,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-30345741 |title=Manx Gaelic 'warriors' praised for language revival - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; with further developments such as using technology to teach the language being put into place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-20392723 |title=New app launched to 'boost' Manx language revival - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
{{main|Irish language}}
Estimates of numbers of native speakers of the [[Irish language]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]] in 2000 ranged from 20,000 to 80,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Linguistic Minorities in Multilingual Settings: Implications for Language Policies | first =Christina Bratt | last = Paulston | publisher=J. Benjamins Pub |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Irish Writing in the Twentieth Century |last=Pierce |first= David |year=2000 |publisher=Cork University Press |page=1140}}: 20,000 to 80,000 speakers out of a population of 3.5 to 5 million.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ó hÉallaithe | first=Donncha |year=1999 |title= Cuisle}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2006 census for the Republic, 85,000 people used Irish daily outside of school and 1.2 million used Irish at least occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Table | title = Census | publisher = CSO | place = IE | contribution-url = http://census.cso.ie/Census/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=75642}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 Census, these numbers increased to 94,000 and 1.3 million, respectively.&lt;ref name = "Census 2011 - This is Ireland"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census2011pdr/Pdf%208%20Tables.pdf | title=Census 2011 – This is Ireland|publisher = Central Statistics Office|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active Irish speakers probably comprise 5 to 10 per cent of Ireland's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Suzanne | last = Romaine | contribution = Irish in a Global Context | title = A New View of the Irish Language | editor = Caoilfhionn Nic Pháidín and Seán Ó Cearnaigh | place = Dublin | publisher = Cois Life Teoranta | year = 2008 |  ISBN = 978-1-901176-82-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades there has been a significant increase in the number of urban Irish speakers, particularly in Dublin. The dispersed but large, educated and middle-class urban Gaeilgoir community enjoys a lively cultural life and is buoyed by the growth of [[Irish medium education]] and [[List of Irish language media|Irish-language media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = McCloskey | first = James | contribution = Irish as a World Language | year = 2006 | type = seminar | title = Why Irish? | format = PDF | publisher = The University of Notre Dame | origyear = September 2005 | contribution-url = http://ohlone.ucsc.edu/~jim/PDF/notre-dame.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some official [[Gaeltacht]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;aí (Irish-speaking regions) areas, Irish remains a vernacular language alongside English.

===Scotland===
In Scotland, [[Scottish Gaelic]] is widely spoken{{fact|date=February 2017}} in the [[Scottish Lowlands]], with about half of Gaelic speakers living outside the traditional [[Gàidhealtachd]], largely due to migration and the expansion of [[Gaelic medium education in Scotland|Gaelic medium education]] in the Lowlands. In the 21st century, phrases such as ''[[Alba gu bràth]]'' and ''Saor Alba'' have been appropriated as catchphrases and rallying cries for Scottish identity and the [[Scottish independence movement]].

{{Refimprove|date=April 2008}}

In [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]], '''gemination''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|dʒ|ɛ|m|ɪ|ˈ|n|eɪ|ʃ|ən}}), or '''consonant lengthening''', is an articulation of a [[consonant]] for a longer period of time than that of a single instance of the same type of consonant. It is distinct from [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and may appear independently of it. ''Gemination'' literally means "twinning" and comes from the same Latin root as "[[List of Greek and Latin roots in English|Gemini]]".

Consonant length is [[distinctive feature|distinctive]] in some languages, like [[Arabic]], [[Berber language|Berber]], [[Maltese language|Maltese]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Classical Hebrew]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Latin]], [[Malayalam]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. Most languages (including [[English language|English]]) do not have distinctive long consonants, however.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

[[Vowel length]] is distinctive in more languages than consonant length is.{{source needed|date=June 2018}} Several languages, like Arabic, Japanese, Finnish and Estonian, feature both independently, however; others, like Italian, [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], have interdependent vowel and consonant length.

==Phonetics==
Lengthened [[fricative consonant|fricatives]], [[nasal consonant|nasals]], [[lateral consonant|laterals]], [[approximant consonant|approximants]] and [[trill consonant|trills]] are simply prolonged. In lengthened [[stop consonant|stops]], the obstruction of the airway is prolonged, which delays release, and the "hold" is lengthened.

Long consonants are usually pronounced one-and-a-half to two times as long as short consonants, depending on the language.

==Phonology==
Gemination of consonants is distinctive in some languages and then is subject to various phonological constraints that depend on the language.

In some languages, like Italian, Swedish, [[Faroese language|Faroese]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], many Finnish dialects and [[Luganda]], consonant length and vowel length depend on each other. A short vowel within a stressed syllable almost always precedes a long consonant or a consonant cluster, and a long vowel must be followed by a short consonant. In [[Classical Arabic]], a [[long vowel]] was lengthened even more before permanently-geminate [[consonant]]s, but that no longer occurs in modern [[varieties of Arabic]] or even [[Modern Standard Arabic]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In other languages, such as [[Finnish language|Finnish]], consonant length and vowel length are independent of each other. In Finnish, both are phonemic; {{lang|fi|taka}} {{IPA|/taka/}} "back", {{lang|fi|takka}} {{IPA|/takːa/}} "fireplace" and {{lang|fi|taakka}} {{IPA|/taːkːa/}} "burden" are different, unrelated words. Finnish consonant length is also affected by [[consonant gradation]]. Another important phenomenon is [[sandhi]], which produces long consonants to word boundaries from an [[phoneme#neutralization and archiphonemes|archiphonemic]] [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|{{!}}otaʔ se{{!}}}} &gt; {{lang|fi|otas se}} "take it!"

Also, in some Finnish compound words, if the initial word ends in an {{lang|fi|e}}, the initial consonant of the following word is geminated: {{lang|fi|jätesäkki}} "trash bag" {{IPA|[jætesːækːi]}}, {{lang|fi|tervetuloa}} "welcome" {{IPA|[terʋetːuloa]}}. In certain cases, a {{lang|fi|v}} after a {{lang|fi|u}} is geminated by most people: {{lang|fi|ruuvi}} "screw" {{IPA|/ruːʋ:i/}}, {{lang|fi|vauva}} "baby" {{IPA|[ʋauʋ:a]}}. In the [[Tampere]] dialect, if a word receives gemination of {{lang|fi|v}} after {{lang|fi|u}}, the {{lang|fi|u}} is often deleted: {{lang|fi|ruuvi}} {{IPA|[ruʋ:i]}}, {{lang|fi|vauva}} {{IPA|[ʋaʋ:a]}} and {{lang|fi|lauantai}} "Saturday" receive a medial {{lang|fi|v}} {{IPA|[lauʋantai]}} and so a further deletion of {{lang|fi|u}} may occur: {{IPA|[laʋ:antai]}}.

Distinctive consonant length is usually restricted to certain consonants. There are very few languages that have initial consonant length; among them are [[Pattani Malay language|Pattani Malay]], [[Chuukese language|Chuukese]], [[Moroccan Arabic]], a few [[Romance languages]] such as [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] as well as many [[High Alemannic German]] dialects, such as that of [[Thurgovia]]. Some African languages, such as [[Setswana]] and [[Luganda]], also have initial consonant length: it is very common in Luganda and indicates certain [[grammar|grammatical]] features. In [[Colloquial Finnish]] and [[Italian phonology|spoken Italian]], long consonants are produced between words because of [[sandhi]].

The reverse of gemination reduces a long consonant to a short one, which is called ''degemination''. It is a pattern in Baltic-Finnic [[consonant gradation]] that the strong grade (often the [[nominative]]) form of the word is degeminated into a weak grade (often all the other cases) form of the word: {{lang|fi|taakka}} &gt; {{lang|fi|taakan}} (burden, of the burden). As an historical restructuring at the [[Phoneme|phonemic level]], word-internal long consonants degeminated in [[Western Romance]] languages: e.g. Spanish /ˈboka/ 'mouth' vs. Italian /ˈbokka/, the latter of which continues Latin geminate /kk/.

==Examples==

===Arabic===
Arabic marks gemination with a diacritic ([[haraka|{{transl|ar|ḥaraka}}]]) shaped like a rounded ''w'', called the [[shadda]] ({{lang|ar|ـّ}}). It is written above the consonant that is to be doubled. It is sometimes used to avoid [[ambiguity]] in text that otherwise lacks diacritics, and is the diacritic most commonly used in this way: for example, a shadda can distinguish {{lang|ar|مدرّسة}} {{transl|ar|mudarrisa}} "female teacher" from {{lang|ar|مدرسة}} {{transl|ar|madrasa}} "school" (with full diacritics: {{lang|ar|مُدَرِّسَة}} and {{lang|ar|مَدْرَسَة}}).

===Berber===
In [[Berber languages|Berber]], each consonant has a geminate counterpart, and gemination is lexically contrastive. The distinction between single and geminate consonants is attested in medial position as well as in absolute initial and final positions.

*''ini'' "say"
*''inni'' "those in question"
*''akal'' "earth, soil"
*''akkal'' "loss"
*''imi'' "mouth"
*''immi'' "mother"
*''ifis'' "hyena"
*''ifiss'' "he was quiet"
*''tamda'' "pond, lake, oasis"
*''tamedda'' "brown buzzard, hawk" 

In addition to lexical geminates, Berber also has phonologically-derived and morphologically-derived geminates . Phonologically-derived geminates can surface by concatenation (e.g. {{IPA|[fas sin]}} 'give him two!') or by complete assimilation (e.g. {{IPA|1=/rad = k i-sli/}} {{IPA|[rakk isli]}} 'he will touch you'). The morphological alternations include imperfective gemination, with some Berber verbs forming their
imperfective stem by geminating one consonant in their perfective stem (e.g. {{IPA|[ftu]}} 'go! PF', {{IPA|[fttu]}} 'go! IMPF'), as well as quantity alternations between singular and plural forms (e.g. {{IPA|[afus]}} 'hand', {{IPA|[ifassn]}} 'hands').

===Catalan===
In [[Catalan language|Catalan]], geminates are expressed in writing with consonant repetition, such as {{lang|ca|i'''nn'''ecessari}} 'unnecessary', which is pronounced {{IPA|[inːəsəˈsaɾi]}} in careful speech. Gemination is not represented if it is purely phonetic, such as the [[assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]] occurring in {{lang|ca|to'''t''' bé}} {{IPA|/ˈtot ˈbe/ → [ˈtob ˈbe]}} 'all good'. Since the repetition of the letter {{lang|ca|l}} generates the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] {{lang|ca|ll}}, which represents the phoneme {{IPAslink|ʎ}}, the geminate {{IPA|/ll/}} is represented as two ''l''s separated by a {{lang|ca|[[punt volat]]}} or centered dot ({{lang|ca|[[l·l]]}}):
* {{lang|ca|col·legi}} 'school'
* {{lang|ca|varicel·la}} 'chickenpox'
* {{lang|ca|mil·lenari}} 'millenary'

===Danish===
[[Danish language|Danish]] has a three-way consonant length distinction. For instance:

* {{lang|da|bunde}} {{IPA|[b̥ɔnə]}} "bottoms"
* {{lang|da|bundne}} {{IPA|[b̥ɔnnə]}} "bound" (pl.)
* {{lang|da|bundene}} {{IPA|[b̥ɔnn̩nə]}} "the bottoms"

The word {{lang|da|bundene}} can phonemically be analyzed as {{IPA|/bɔnənə/}}, with the middle schwa being assimilated to {{IPA|[n]}}.

===English===
In [[English phonology]], consonant length is not distinctive within [[root word]]s. For instance, ''baggage'' is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|ɡ|ɪ|dʒ}}, not {{IPA|*/bæɡːɪdʒ/}}. However, phonetic gemination does occur marginally.

Gemination is found across words and across morphemes when the last consonant in a given word and the first consonant in the following word are the same [[fricative]], [[nasal consonant|nasal]], or [[stop consonant|stop]]. For instance:
* ''calm man'' {{IPA|[ˌkɑːmˈmæn]}}
* ''this saddle'' {{IPA|[ðɪsˈsædəl]}}
* ''midday'' {{IPA|[ˈmɪd.deɪ]}}
* ''lamppost'' {{IPA|[ˈlæmp.poʊst]}} (cf. lamb post, compost)
* ''cattail'' {{IPA|[ˈkæt.teɪl]}} (compare consonant length in "catfish")
* ''roommate'' {{IPA|[ˈrum.meɪt]}}
* ''subbasement'' {{IPA|[ˌsʌbˈbeɪsmənt]}}
* ''evenness'' {{IPA|[ˈiːvənnəs]}}
* ''misspell'' {{IPA|[ˌmɪsˈspɛl]}}
* ''prime minister'' {{IPA|[ˌpraɪmˈmɪnɪstər]}}

With [[affricate]]s, however, this does not occur. For instance:
* ''orange juice'' {{IPA|[ˈɒrɪndʒ.dʒuːs]}}

In most instances, the absence of this doubling does not affect the meaning, though it may confuse the listener momentarily. The following [[minimal pair]]s represent examples where the doubling ''does'' affect the meaning in most accents:

* ''ten nails'' versus ''ten ales''
* ''this sin'' versus ''this inn''
* ''five alleys'' versus ''five valleys''
* ''his own'' versus ''his zone''
* ''unaimed'' {{IPA|[ʌnˈeɪmd]}} versus ''unnamed'' {{IPA|[ʌnˈneɪmd]}}
* ''foreigner'' {{IPA|[ˈfɔːrənər]}} versus ''forerunner'' {{IPA|[ˈfɔːrˌrənər]}} (only in some varieties of General American)

In some dialects gemination is also found when the suffix ''-ly'' follows a root ending in -l or -ll, as in:
* ''solely'' {{IPA|[ˈsoʊl.li]}}

In some varieties of [[Welsh English]], the process takes place indiscriminately between vowels, e.g. in ''money'' {{IPA|[ˈmɜn.niː]}} but it also applies with graphemic duplication (thus, orthographically dictated), e.g. ''butter'' {{IPA|[ˈbɜt̚.tə]}}&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, David (2003). ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language'' Second Edition, Cambridge University Press, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt;

===Estonian===
[[Estonian language|Estonian]] has three phonemic lengths; however, the third length is a [[suprasegmental]] feature, which is as much tonal patterning as a length distinction. It is traceable to [[allophony]] caused by now-deleted suffixes, for example half-long {{lang|et|linna}} &lt; *{{lang|et|linnan}} "of the city" vs. overlong {{lang|et|linna}} &lt; *{{lang|et|linnahan}} "to the city".{{clarify|date=August 2013|reason=Is the n or the a long in these words?}}

===Finnish===
{{See also|Finnish phonology}}

Consonant length is phonemic in Finnish: For example, {{lang|fi|takka}} {{IPA-fi|ˈtakːa|}} (transcribed with the length sign {{IPA|[ː]}} or with a doubled sign {{IPA|[ˈtakka]}}), 'fireplace', but {{lang|fi|taka}} {{IPA|[ˈtaka]}}, 'back'. Consonant gemination occurs with simple consonants ({{lang|fi|hakaa : hakkaa}}) and between syllables in the pattern (consonant)-vowel-sonorant-stop-stop-vowel ({{lang|fi|palkka}}), but not generally in codas or with longer syllables. (This occurs in [[Sami languages]], so there is the name of Sami origin {{lang|fi|Jouhkki}}).

Sandhi may also produce geminates. Consonant and vowel gemination are both phonemic and occur independently, e.g. {{lang|fi|Mali}}, {{lang|fi|maali}}, {{lang|fi|malli}}, {{lang|fi|maallinen}} (Mali (a Karelian surname), paint, model and secular, respectively).

In Standard Finnish, consonant gemination of {{IPA|[h]}} exists only in [[interjection]]s, new loan words and in the playful word "[[wikt:hihhuli|hihhuli]]", with its origins in the 19th century, and derivatives of that word.

In multiple Finnish dialects there are also types of special gemination when in contact with long vowels: Southwestern special gemination ("Lounaismurteiden erikoisgeminaatio") (lengthening of stops+shortening of long vowel), with the type {{lang|fi|Leipää&lt; Leippä}}, the "Common gemination" ("Yleisgeminaatio") (all consonants in short, stressed syllables are lengthened), with the type {{lang|fi|Putoaa &gt; Puttoo}}, and its extension (which is strongest in the northwestern Savonian dialects), the "Eastern dialectal special gemination" ("Itämurteiden erikoisgeminaatio") (same as the Common gradation, but applies also to unstressed syllables and certain clusters), with the types {{lang|fi|Lehmiä &gt; Lehmmii}} and {{lang|fi|Maksetaan &gt; Maksettaan}}.

===French===
{{See also|French phonology}}
In French, consonant length is usually not distinctive, but in certain exceptional cases it can be, such as the pair {{lang|fr|courons}} {{IPA|[kuʁɔ̃]}} vs {{lang|fr|courrons}} {{IPA|[kuʁːɔ̃]}}. Gemination also occurs in case of [[schwa]] elision.

===Ganda===
[[Luganda|Ganda]] is unusual in that gemination can occur word-initially, as well as word-medially. For example, {{lang|lg|kkapa}} {{IPA|/kːapa/}} 'cat', {{IPA|/ɟːaɟːa/}} {{lang|lg|jjajja}} 'grandfather' and {{IPA|/ɲːabo/}} {{lang|lg|nnyabo}} 'madam' all begin with geminate consonants.

There are three consonants that cannot be geminated: {{IPA|/j/}}, {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/l/}}. Whenever [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] rules would geminate these consonants, {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} are prefixed with {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, and {{IPA|/l/}} changes to {{IPA|/d/}}. For example:
* {{lang|lg|-ye}} {{IPA|/je/}} 'army' (root) &gt; {{lang|lg|ggye}} {{IPA|/ɟːe/}} 'an army' (noun)
* {{lang|lg|-yinja}} {{IPA|/jiːɲɟa/}} 'stone' (root) &gt; {{lang|lg|jjinja}} {{IPA|/ɟːiːɲɟa/}} 'a stone' (noun); {{lang|lg|jj}} is usually spelt {{lang|lg|ggy}}
* {{lang|lg|-wanga}} {{IPA|/waːŋɡa/}} 'nation' (root) &gt; {{lang|lg|ggwanga}} {{IPA|/ɡːwaːŋɡa/}} 'a nation' (noun)
* {{lang|lg|-lagala}} {{IPA|/laɡala/}} 'medicine' (root) &gt; {{lang|lg|ddagala}} {{IPA|/dːaɡala/}} 'medicine' (noun)

===Greek===
{{see also|Ancient Greek phonology#Doubled consonants|l1=Ancient Greek phonology: Doubled consonants}}
In [[Ancient Greek]], consonant length was distinctive, e.g., {{lang|grc|μέ'''λ'''ω}} {{IPA|[mélɔː]}} "I am of interest" vs. {{lang|grc|μέ'''λλ'''ω}} {{IPA|[mélːɔː]}} "I am going to". The distinction has been lost in the [[Standard Modern Greek|standard]] and most other [[Varieties of Modern Greek|varieties]], with the exception of [[Cypriot Greek#Geminates|Cypriot]] (where it might carry over from Ancient Greek or arise from a number of synchronic and diachronic assimilatory processes, or even spontaneously), some varieties of the southeastern Aegean, and [[Greek-Bovesian|Italy]].

=== Hindi and Urdu ===
Gemination is common in [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]]. It is found in words of both Indic and Arabic origin, but not in those of Persian origin:

* pa'''''tt'''''aa – leaf
* a'''''bb'''''aa – father
* na'''''qq'''''aal – impersonator
* da'''''jj'''''aal – anti-Christ
* Da'''''bb'''''aa – box
* mu'''''nn'''''aa – young boy/baby
* ga'''''dd'''''aa – mattress

For aspirated consonants, the geminate is formed by combining the corresponding non-aspirated consonant followed by its aspirated counterpart. There are few examples where an aspirated consonant is truly doubled.

* pa'''''t.th'''''ar – stone
* ka'''''t.th'''''aa – brown spread on paan
* a'''''d.dh'''''aa – slang/short for half (aadhaa)
* ma'''''k.kh'''''ii – fly

===Hungarian===
In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], consonant length is phonemic, e.g. {{lang|hu|megy}} {{IPA-hu|ˈmɛɟ|}}, 'goes' and {{lang|hu|meggy}} {{IPA|[ˈmɛɟː]}}, 'sour cherry'.

===Italian===
{{see also|syntactic doubling}}
In Standard [[Italian language|Italian]], consonant length is distinctive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dizionario.rai.it/static.aspx?treeID=25 |title=Raddoppiamenti di vocali e di consonanti |year=2009 |work=Dizionario italiano d'ortografia e pronunzia (DOP)|publisher=[[RAI]]|accessdate=November 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, {{lang|it|bevve}}, meaning "he/she drank", is phonemically {{IPA|/ˈbevve/}} and pronounced {{IPA-it|ˈbevːe|}}, while {{lang|it|beve}} ("he/she drinks/is drinking") is {{IPA|/ˈbeve/}}, pronounced {{IPA-it|ˈbeːve|}}. Tonic syllables are [[mora (linguistics)|bimoraic]] and are therefore composed of either a long vowel in an open syllable (as in {{lang|it|beve}}) or a short vowel in a closed syllable (as in {{lang|it|bevve}}). In varieties with post-vocalic [[lenition|weakening]] of some consonants (e.g. {{IPA|/raˈdʒone/}} → {{IPA-itdia|raˈʒoːne|}} 'reason'), geminates are not affected ({{IPA|/ˈmaddʒo/}} → {{IPA-itdia|ˈmadːʒo|}} 'May'). 

Double or long consonants occur not only within words but also at word boundaries, and they are then pronounced but not necessarily written: {{lang|it|chi}} + {{lang|it|sa}} = {{lang|it|chissà}} ("who knows") {{IPA-it|kisˈsa|}} and {{lang|it|vado a casa}} ("I am going home") {{IPA-it|ˌvaːdo a kˈkaːsa|}} (the latter example refers to central and southern standard Italian). All consonants except {{IPAslink|z}} can be geminated. This word-initial gemination is triggered either lexically by the item preceding the lengthening consonant (e.g. by preposition ''a'' 'to, at' in [akˈkaːsa] ''a casa'' 'homeward' but not by definite article ''la'' in [laˈkaːsa] ''la casa'' 'the house'), or by any word-final stressed vowel ([parˈlɔffranˈt͡ʃeːze] ''parlò francese'' 's/he spoke French' but [ˈparlafranˈt͡ʃeːze] ''parla francese'' 's/he speaks French').

===Japanese===
{{See also|Japanese phonology#Gemination}}
In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], consonant length is distinctive (as is vowel length). Gemination in the [[syllabary]] is represented with the [[sokuon]], a small ''tsu'': っ for [[hiragana]] in native words and ッ for [[katakana]] in foreign words. For example, 来た (きた, ''kita'') means "came; arrived", while 切った (きった, ''kitta'') means "cut; sliced". With the influx of ''[[gairaigo]]'' ("foreign words") into Modern Japanese, [[voiced consonants]] have become able to geminate as well:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}, p. 538&lt;/ref&gt; バグ (''bagu'') means "(computer) bug", and バッグ (''baggu'') means "bag". Distinction between [[voiceless]] gemination and [[voiced]] gemination is visible in pairs of words such as キット (''kitto'', meaning "kit") and キッド (''kiddo'', meaning "kid"). In addition, in some variants of colloquial Modern Japanese, gemination may be applied to some adjectives and adverbs (regardless of voicing) in order to add emphasis: すごい (''sugoi'', "amazing") contrasts with すっごい (''suggoi'', "''really'' amazing"); 思い切り (おもいきり, ''omoikiri'', "with all one's strength") contrasts with 思いっ切り (おもいっきり, ''omoikkiri'', "''really'' with all one's strength").

===Korean===
{{main|Korean phonology#Consonant assimilation}}
In [[Korean language|Korean]], geminates arise from [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], and they are distinctive.

===Latin and Romance languages===
In [[Latin]], consonant length was distinctive, as in {{lang|la|a'''n'''us}} "anus" vs. {{lang|la|a'''nn'''us}} "year". ([[Vowel length]] was also distinctive in Latin, but is not reflected in the orthography.) Geminates inherited from Latin still exist in [[Italian language|Italian]], in which {{IPA|[ˈanːo]}} {{lang|it|anno}} and {{IPA|[ˈaːno]}} {{lang|it|ano}} contrast with regard to {{IPA|/nn/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} as in Latin. It has been almost completely lost in [[French language|French]] and completely in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. In [[West Iberian languages]], former Latin geminate consonants often evolved to new phonemes, including some instances of [[nasal vowel]]s in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and Old [[Galician language|Galician]] as well as most cases of {{IPA|/ɲ/}} and {{IPA|/ʎ/}} in Spanish, but phonetic length of both consonants and vowels is no longer distinctive.

=== Malayalam ===
In [[Malayalam]], compounding is phonologically conditioned&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Interplay of Morphology and Phonology |last=Inkelas |first=Sharon |series=Oxford Surveys in Syntax &amp; Morphology |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 |isbn=9780199280476 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; so gemination occurs at words' internal boundaries.

Consider following example:

* {{lang|ml|മേശ}} + {{lang|ml|പെട്ടി}} ({{transl|ml|mēśa}} + {{transl|ml|peṭṭi}}) – {{lang|ml|മേശപ്പെട്ടി}} ({{transl|ml|mēśappeṭṭi}})

===Marathi===
In Marathi, the compounding occurs quite frequently, as in the words haṭṭa (stubbornness), kaṭṭā (platform) or sattā (power). It seems to happen most commonly with the dental and retroflex consonants.

=== Norwegian ===

Gemination is indicated in writing by double consonants. Gemination often differentiates between otherwise unrelated words.

*{{lang|no|måte}} / {{lang|no|måtte}} – "method" / "had to"
*{{lang|no|lete}} / {{lang|no|lette}} – "search" / "take off"
*{{lang|no|sine}} / {{lang|no|sinne}} – "theirs" / "anger"

===Polish===
In [[Polish language|Polish]], consonant length is indicated with two identical letters. Examples:

*{{lang|pl|wanna}} {{IPA|/ˈvanːa/}} – "bathtub"
*{{lang|pl|[[Anna (given name)|Anna]]}} {{IPA|/ˈanːa/}}
*{{lang|pl|horror}} {{IPA|/ˈxɔrːɔr/}} – "horror"
*{{lang|pl|hobby}} {{IPA|/ˈxɔbːɨ/}} – "hobby"

Consonant length is distinctive and sometimes is necessary to distinguish words:

*{{lang|pl|rodziny}} {{IPA|/rɔˈd͡ʑinɨ/}} – "families"; {{lang|pl|rodzinny}} {{IPA|/rɔˈd͡ʑinːɨ/}} – adjective of "family"
*{{lang|pl|saki}} {{IPA|/saki/}} – "sacks, bags"; {{lang|pl|ssaki}} {{IPA|/sːaki/}} – "mammals",
*{{lang|pl|leki}} {{IPA|/ˈlɛkʲi/}} – "medicines"; {{lang|pl|lekki}} {{IPA|/ˈlɛkʲːi/}} – "light, lightweight"

Double consonants are common on morpheme borders where the initial or final sound of the suffix is the same as the final or initial sound of the stem (depending on the position of the suffix). Examples:

*{{lang|pl|przedtem}} {{IPA|/ˈpʂɛtːɛm/}} – "before, previously"; from {{lang|pl|przed}} (suffix "before") + {{lang|pl|tem}} (archaic "that")
*{{lang|pl|oddać}} {{IPA|/ˈɔdːat͡ɕ/}} – "give back"; from {{lang|pl|od}} (suffix "from") + {{lang|pl|dać}} ("give")
*{{lang|pl|bagienny}} {{IPA|/baˈgʲɛnːɨ/}} – "swampy"; from {{lang|pl|bagno}} ("swamp") + {{lang|pl|ny}} (suffix forming adjectives)
*{{lang|pl|najjaśniejszy}} {{IPA|/najːaɕˈɲɛ̯iʂɨ/}} – "brightest"; from {{lang|pl|naj}} (suffix forming superlative) + {{lang|pl|jaśniejszy}} ("brighter")

===Punjabi===
[[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] in its official script [[Gurmukhi script|Gurmukhi]] uses a diacritic called an áddak ( {{lang|pa|ੱ}} ) ({{lang|pa|ਅੱਧਕ}}, {{IPA|[ə́dːək]}}) which is written above the word and indicates that the following consonant is geminate. Gemination is specially characteristic of Punjabi compared to other Indo-Aryan languages like Hindi-Urdu, where instead of the presence of consonant lengthening, the preceding vowel tends to be lengthened. Consonant length is distinctive in Punjabi, for example:

* {{lang|pa|ਦਸ}} {{IPA|[d̪əs]}} – 'ten'; {{lang|pa|ਦੱਸ}} {{IPA|[d̪əsː]}} – 'tell' (verb)
* {{lang|pa|ਪਤਾ}} {{IPA|[pət̪a]}} – 'aware of something'; '{{lang|pa|ਪੱਤਾ}} {{IPA|[pət̪ːa]}} – 'leaf'
* {{lang|pa|ਸਤ}} {{IPA|[sət̪]}} – 'truth' (liturgical); {{lang|pa|ਸੱਤ}} {{IPA|[sət̪ː]}} – 'seven'
* {{lang|pa|ਕਲਾ}} {{IPA|[kəla]}} – 'art'; {{lang|pa|ਕੱਲਾ}} {{IPA|[kəlːa]}} – 'alone'

===Russian===
In [[Russian language|Russian]], consonant length (indicated with two letters, as in {{lang|ru|ва'''нн'''а}} {{IPA|[ˈva'''nn'''ə]}} 'bathtub') may occur in several situations.

[[Minimal pairs]] (or [[chroneme]]s) exist, such as {{wikt-lang|ru|по'''д'''ержать}} {{IPA|[pə'''d'''ʲɪrˈʐatʲ]}} 'to hold' vs {{wikt-lang|ru|по'''дд'''ержать}} {{IPA|[pə'''dʲː'''ɪrˈʐatʲ]}} 'to support', and their conjugations, or {{wikt-lang|ru|дли'''н'''а}} {{IPA|[dlʲɪˈ'''n'''a]}} 'length' vs {{wikt-lang|ru|дли'''нн'''а}} {{IPA|[dlʲɪˈ'''nː'''a]}} 'long' adj. f.

*[[Word formation]] or [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]]: {{lang|ru|дли'''н'''а}} ({{IPA|[dlʲɪˈ'''n'''a]}} 'length') &gt; {{lang|ru|дли'''нн'''ый}} ({{IPA|[ˈdlʲi'''nn'''ɨj]}} 'long') This occurs when two adjacent morphemes have the same consonant and is comparable to the situation of Polish described above.
*[[Assimilation (linguistics)|Assimilation]]. The spelling usually reflects the unassimilated consonants, but they are pronounced as a single long consonant.
**{{lang|ru|вы'''сш'''ий}} ({{IPA|[ˈvɨ'''ʂː'''ɨj]}} 'highest').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Sami languages===
Most [[Sami languages]] contrast three different degrees of consonant length. These often contrast in different forms within a single inflectional paradigm, as in [[Northern Sami]] ''goarˈrut'' "let's sew!" versus ''goarrut'' "to sew, we sew" versus ''goarut'' "you (sg.) sew". Often, progressively longer consonants correspond to a progressively shorter preceding vowel.

In [[Proto-Samic]], the common ancestor of the Sami languages, there was already a contrast between single and geminate consonants, inherited from [[Proto-Uralic]]. A process called [[consonant gradation]] then lengthened all consonants when they stood at the end of a stressed syllable, if the next syllable was [[open syllable|open]]. The subsequent loss of final consonants and vowels in the later Sami languages made this process contrastive, resulting in as many as four contrastive lengths (lengthened geminate, unlengthened geminate, lengthened single, unlengthened single). The modern Sami languages have reduced this to three, by merging the unlengthened geminates with the lengthened single consonants.

===Turkish===
In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], gemination in [[word stem]] is exclusive to [[loanwords]]. Gemination is indicated by two identical letters as in most languages that have phonemic gemination.

* {{lang|tr|müderrise}} {{IPA|[myˈdeɾːise]}} ([from Arabic, mostly obsolete] "female teacher")
* {{lang|tr|[[pizza]]}} {{IPA|[piˈzːa]}} (from Italian)

Loanwords originally ending with a geminated [[consonant]] are always written and pronounced without the ending gemination.

* {{lang|tr|hac}} {{IPA|[hadʒ]}} ([[hajj]]) (from Arabic {{lang|ar|حج}} {{IPA|[ħadʒː]}})
* {{lang|tr|hat}} {{IPA|[hat]}} ([[Islamic calligraphy]]) (from Arabic {{lang|ar|خط}} {{IPA|[xatː]}})

Although gemination is resurrected when the word takes a suffix.

* {{lang|tr|hac}} becomes {{lang|tr|hacca}} {{IPA|[haˈdʒːa]}} (to hajj) when it takes the suffix "-a" (to, indicating destination)
* {{lang|tr|hat}} becomes {{lang|tr|hattın}} {{IPA|[haˈtːɯn]}} (of calligraphy) when it takes the suffix "-ın" (of, expressing possession)

Gemination also occurs when a [[suffix]] starting with a consonant comes after a word that ends with the same consonant.

* {{lang|tr|el}} {{IPA|[el]}} (hand) + {{lang|tr|-ler}} {{IPA|[leɾ]}} ("-s", marks [[plural]]) = {{lang|tr|eller}} {{IPA|[eˈlːeɾ]}} (hands). (contrasts with {{lang|tr|eler}}, s/he eliminates)
* {{lang|tr|at}} {{IPA|[at]}} (to throw) + {{lang|tr|-tık}} {{IPA|[tɯk]}} ("-ed", marks [[past tense]], [[Grammatical person|first person plural]]) = {{lang|tr|attık}} {{IPA|[aˈtːɯk]}} (we threw [smth.]). (contrasts with {{lang|tr|atık}}, waste)

===Ukrainian===
In [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], geminates are found between vowels: {{lang|uk|багаття}} {{IPA|/bɑˈɦɑtʲːɑ/}} "bonfire", {{lang|uk|подружжя}} {{IPA|/poˈdruʒʲːɑ/}} "married couple", {{lang|uk|обличчя}} {{IPA|/obˈlɪt͡ʃʲːɑ/}} "face". Geminates also occur at the start of a few words: {{lang|uk|лляний}} {{IPA|/lʲːɑˈnɪj/}} "flaxen", forms of the verb {{lang|uk|лити}} "to pour" ({{lang|uk|ллю}} {{IPA|/lʲːu/}}, {{lang|uk|ллєш}} {{IPA|/lʲːɛʃ/}} etc.), {{lang|uk|ссати}} {{IPA|/ˈsːɑtɪ/}} "to suck" and derivatives. Gemination is in some cases semantically crucial; for example, {{lang|uk|манна}} means "manna" or "semolina" while {{lang|uk|мана}} means "delusion".

===Wagiman===
In [[Wagiman language|Wagiman]], an [[Indigenous Australian languages|indigenous Australian language]], consonant length in stops is the primary phonetic feature that differentiates [[fortis and lenis]] stops. Wagiman does not have phonetic voice. Word-initial and word-final stops never contrast for length.

==Writing==
In [[writing|written language]], consonant length is often indicated by writing a consonant twice (''ss'', ''kk'', ''pp'', and so forth), but can also be indicated with a special symbol, such as the [[shadda]] in Arabic, the [[dagesh]] in Classical Hebrew, or the [[sokuon]] in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. Estonian uses ''b'', ''d'', ''g'' for short consonants, and ''p'', ''t'', ''k'' and ''pp'', ''tt'', ''kk'' are used for long consonants.

In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], long consonants are normally written using the [[triangular colon]] '''{{IPA|ː}}''', e.g. ''penne'' {{IPA|[penːe]}} ('feathers', 'pens', also a kind of pasta), though doubled letters are also used (especially for underlying [[phonemic]] forms, or in tone languages to facilitate diacritic marking).

* [[Catalan orthography|Catalan]] uses the raised dot (called an "[[interpunct]]") to distinguish a geminated {{lang|ca|l}} from a palatal {{lang|ca|[[ll]]}}. Thus, {{lang|ca|paral·lel}} ("parallel") and {{lang|ca|[[Ramon Llull|Llull]]}} (Standard Catalan: {{IPA|[pəɾəlˈlɛl]}}, {{IPA|[ʎuʎ]}}).
* [[Hungarian alphabet|Hungarian digraphs and trigraphs]] are geminated by doubling the first letter only, thus the geminate form of {{lang|hu|sz}} {{IPA|/s/}} is {{lang|hu|ssz}} {{IPA|/sː/}} (rather than *''szsz''), and that of {{lang|hu|dzs}} {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} is {{lang|hu|ddzs}} {{IPA|/d͡ʒː/}}.
* The only digraph in [[Luganda|Ganda]], {{lang|lg|ny}} {{IPA|/ɲ/}} is doubled in the same way: {{lang|lg|nny}} {{IPA|/ɲː/}}.
* In [[Italian language|Italian]], geminated instances of the sound cluster {{IPA|[kw]}} (represented by the digraph {{lang|it|qu}}) are always indicated by writing {{lang|it|cq}}, except in the words {{lang|it|soqquadro}} and {{lang|it|beqquadro}}, where the letter {{lang|it|q}} is doubled. The gemination of sounds {{IPA|[ɲ]}}, {{IPA|[ʃ]}} and {{IPA|[ʎ]}}, (spelled {{lang|it|gn}}, {{lang|it|sc(i)}}, and {{lang|it|gl(i)}}, respectively) is not indicated because these consonants are always geminated when occurring between vowels. Also the sounds {{IPA|[ts]}}, {{IPA|[dz]}} (both spelled {{lang|it|z}}) are always geminated when occurring between vowels, yet their gemination is sometimes shown, redundantly, by doubling the {{lang|it|z}} as, e.g., in {{lang|it|pizza}} {{IPA|[ˈpitsːa]}}.
* In [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], the general rule is that a geminated consonant is written double, unless succeeded by another consonant. Hence ''hall'' ("hall"), but ''halt'' ("Halt!"). In Swedish, this does not apply to morphological changes (so ''kall'', "cold" and ''kallt'', "coldly" or compounds [so ''tunnbröd'' ("flatbread")]. The exception are some words ending in ''-m'', thus ''hem'' ["home"] [but ''hemma'' ("at home")] and ''stam'' ["stem"], but ''lamm'' ["lamb", to distinguish the word from ''lam'' ("lame")], with a long {{IPA|/a}}/), as well as adjectives in ''-nn'', so ''tunn'', "thin" but ''tunt'', "thinly" (whilst Norwegian has a rule always prohibiting two "m"s at the end of a word (with the exception being only a handful of proper names, and as a rule forms with suffixes reinsert the second "m", and the rule is that these word-final "m"s always cause the preceding vowel sound to be short (despite the spelling)).

===Other representations of double letters===
Doubled orthographic consonants do not always indicate a long phonetic consonant.

* In English, for example, the {{IPA|[n]}} sound of "running" is not lengthened. Consonant digraphs are used in English to indicate the preceding vowel is a short (lax) vowel, while a single letter often allows a long (tense) vowel to occur. For example, "tapping" {{IPA|/tæpɪŋ/}} (from "tap") has a short ''a'' {{IPA|/æ/}}, which is distinct from the diphthongal long ''a'' {{IPA|/eɪ/}} in "taping" {{IPA|/teɪpɪŋ/}} (from "tape").
* In Standard [[Modern Greek]], doubled orthographic consonants have no phonetic significance at all.
* [[Hangul]] (the Korean alphabet) and [[Korean romanization|its romanizations]] also use double consonants, but to indicate [[Fortis and lenis|fortis]] articulation, not gemination.

==Biography==
She is the OG Alkis.

She was born on a family farm near [[Trysil]] in [[Hedmark]] county, [[Norway]]. Her father was story writer, poet, and playwright, [[Sven Moren]]. (1871–1938). She was the eldest and only girl in a family of five children. Her brothers included  philologist [[Sigmund Moren]] (1913–1996). She attended the teacher college in [[Elverum]] 1925-1928, and then held various jobs in [[Hamar]] and [[Oslo]]. In 1930 she moved to [[Switzerland]], where she worked for three years as secretary. In April 1934, she married the Norwegian  author, [[Tarjei Vesaas]] (1897-1970). They settled on the Midtbø farm in [[Vinje]] in [[Telemark]] County  where her husband worked as a teacher (1941–43).&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite web|url =    https://nbl.snl.no/Halldis_Moren_Vesaas|title=  Halldis Moren Vesaas|publisher =  Norsk biografisk leksikon |author= Dag Aanderaa|accessdate= April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =    https://nbl.snl.no/Sven_Moren|title=  Sven Moren|publisher =  Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=Arnfinn Engen|accessdate= April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She debuted in 1929 at 22 years old with a collection of poetry, ''Harp and Dagger''  (''Harpe og dolk'').   Her more notable books of poetry would include ''Speech of Troubled Times'' (''Tung tids tale''), ''The Tree'' (''Treet''), ''In a Different Forest'' (''I ein annan skog'') and ''House of Life'' (''Livshus''). She composed and translated for the theater, especially [[Det Norske Teatret]] in Oslo, wrote articles on various topics and was an external publishing consultant.  She sat on the board of the [[Riksteatret]]  (1949-1969). In 1938, her first children's book translation was published. Her writing won great acclaim in [[Norway]] for her brave and personal expressions of women's life in its several stages: youth, marriage, motherhood, widowhood and second love in old age.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite web|url =    https://snl.no/Halldis_Moren_Vesaas

She was awarded the [[Mads Wiel Nygaards Endowment]] in 1977. She was appointed Commander of the [[Order of St. Olav]] in 1984. She was also a Knight of the National Order of Merit, France's second-highest order.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2886">'''Impromptu debate''' is a type of formalized academic [[debate]]. Representative of [[Comedy debate|comedic debate]], Impromptu debating is practiced at [[high school]]s, generally in tandem with other, more serious forms of debate. In some areas, such as portions of [[Canada]], impromptu debate is treated as formally as [[Parliamentary debate]].

==Content==
Impromptu is an individual event that consists of just one competitor giving a speech against other competitors that give their speech at a separate time. Impromptu differs from other forms of debate because an emphasis on humour is usually given, as well as on logic and performance. The resolutions debated often encourage humorous debates. Further, this form of debate is focused on a specific topic or a quotation. The competitor has a very short window of time usually not more than a few minutes to come up with a speech that generally lasts for a few minutes. This speech is based upon how the speaker interprets the message and whether or not the speaker agrees with the quotation. Many colleges and universities compete in this as well as other forms of speech throughout the US. 

==Format==
Each team comprises two members, each of whom is named according to their team and speaking position within his or her team. The Impromptu format varies, depending on what "traditional" debate format on what it is based. An impromptu debate in [[Policy debate]] style, for example, might follow the Policy speech format, but with radically altered content or speech durations.

[[sess.usask.ca]] The format is conducted in a different way than typical debates. The rules are bent in order to provide the students who have minimal to zero experience in debating to be able to take part in the debate. 

[[Junior State of America|JSA]] Impromptu debate format usually consists of choosing two volunteers out of the students attending the block and then having the audience assign a topic to them.

==Judging==
There are several methods of judging an Impromptu debate. The most standard method is when a single judge observes the debate and simply votes one way or another; however, it is sometimes acceptable to have the audience (if it is sufficiently large) cast votes, with the winner determined by majority.

[[sess.usask.ca]] Although, there are other ways to judge these types of debates. One way is to have a minimum of three judges that all come from different backgrounds - providing diversity and different views. It is not necessary, although encouraged for the judges to have some sort of experience in the topic being debated in addition to experience in debating.

[[Image:German dialectal map.PNG|right|thumb|300px|[[High German]] subdivides into [[Upper German]] (green) and [[Central German]] (blue), and is distinguished from [[Low Franconian]] and [[Low German]] (yellow). The main isoglosses, the [[Benrath line|Benrath]] and [[Speyer line]]s, are marked in black.]]

An '''isogloss''', also called a '''heterogloss''' (see [[#Etymology|Etymology]] below), is the geographic boundary of a certain [[linguistics|linguistic]] feature, such as the pronunciation of a [[vowel]], the meaning of a word, or the use of some morphological or syntactic feature. Major [[dialect]]s are typically demarcated by ''bundles'' of isoglosses, such as the [[Benrath line]] that distinguishes [[High German languages|High German]] from the other [[West Germanic languages]] and the [[La Spezia–Rimini Line]] that divides the Northern Italian dialects from Central Italian dialects. However, an ''individual'' isogloss may or may not have any coincidence with a [[language border]]. For example, the front-rounding of /y/ cuts across France and Germany, while the /y/ is absent from Italian and Spanish words that are cognates with the /y/-containing French words.

One of the best-known isoglosses is the [[centum-satem isogloss]].

Similar to an isogloss, an '''isograph''' is a distinguishing feature of a writing system. Both concepts are also used in [[historical linguistics]].

==Examples==

===Centum-satem isogloss===
The centum-satem isogloss of the [[Indo-European language]] family relates to the different evolution of the [[dorsal consonant]]s of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE). In the standard reconstruction, three series of dorsals are recognised:

{| 
| [[labialized velar consonant|Labiovelars]]: || {{PIE|*kʷ}}, || {{PIE|*gʷ}}, || {{PIE|*gʷʰ}}
|- 
| [[Velars]]:      || {{PIE|*k}},  || {{PIE|*g}},  || {{PIE|*gʰ}}
|- 
| [[Palatals]]:    || {{PIE|*ḱ}},  || {{PIE|*ǵ}},  || {{PIE|*ǵʰ}}
|}

In some branches (for example [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Italic languages|Italic]] and [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]), the palatals merged with the velars: PIE {{PIE|''*'''k'''eup-''}} "tremble (inwardly)" became [[Latin]] '''''c'''upiō'' "desire" and {{PIE|''*'''ḱ'''m̥tom''}} "hundred" became Latin '''''c'''entum'' (pronounced [kentum]); but {{PIE|''*'''kʷ'''o-''}} "[[interrogative pronoun]]" became '''''qu'''ō'' "how? where?". They are known as ''centum'' branches, named after the Latin word for ''hundred''.

In other branches (for example, [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]]), the labiovelars merged with the velars: PIE {{PIE|''*'''k'''eup-''}} became [[Vedic Sanskrit]] '''''k'''opáyati'' "shaken" and {{PIE|''*'''kʷ'''o-''}} became [[Avestan]] ''kō'' "who?"; but {{PIE|''*ḱm̥tom''}} became Avestan '''''s'''atəm''. They are known as ''satem'' branches, after the Avestan word for ''hundred''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fortson IV|first=Benjamin W.|title=Indo-European Language and Culture|pages=52–54|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2004|isbn=1-4051-0316-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben]]|last=Rix|first=Helmut|authorlink=Helmut Rix|page=359|publisher=Dr. Ludwig Reichert Verlag|year=2001|isbn=3-89500-219-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Balto-Slavic family, the Indo-Iranian family, and the other ''satem'' families are spoken in adjacent geographic regions, they can be grouped by an isogloss: a geographic line separating ''satem'' branches on one side from ''centum'' branches on the other.

===North-Midland isogloss (American English)===
A major isogloss in [[American English]] has been identified as the [[Inland Northern American English|North]]-[[North Midland English|Midland]] isogloss, which demarcates numerous linguistic features, including the [[Northern Cities vowel shift]]: regions north of the line (including [[Western New York]]; [[Cleveland, Ohio]]; [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|lower Michigan]]; northern [[Illinois]]; and eastern [[Wisconsin]]) have the shift, while regions south of the line (including [[Pennsylvania]], central and southern [[Ohio]], and most of [[Indiana]]) do not.

===Northwest Semitic===
{{Expert-subject|Linguistics|section|date=December 2009}}
A feature of the ancient [[Northwest Semitic languages]] is ''w'' becoming ''y'' at the beginning of a word. Thus, in [[Proto-Semitic]] and subsequent non-Northwest [[Semitic languages]] and dialects, the [[Semitic root|root letters]] for a word for "child" were ''w-l-d''. However, in the ancient Northwest Semitic languages, the word was ''y-l-d'', with ''w-'' &gt; ''y-''.

Similarly, Proto-Semitic ''ā'' becomes ''ō'' in the [[Canaanite dialects]] of Northwest Semitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garr|first=W. Randall|title=Dialect Geography of Syria-Palestine: 1000-586 BCE|publisher=Eisenbrauns|date=2 June 2008|isbn=1-57506-091-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[Aramaic language]]s and dialects of Northwest Semitic, the historic ''ā'' is preserved. Thus, an ancient Northwest Semitic language whose historic ''ā'' became ''ō'' can be classed as part of the Canaanite branch of Northwest Semitic.

Such features can be used as data of fundamental importance for the purposes of linguistic classification.

==Isographs==
Just as there are distinguishing features of related languages, there are also distinguishing features of related scripts. (For a discussion of [[writing system]]s, see ''The World's Writing Systems''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Daniels|editor1-first=Peter|editor2-last=Bright|editor2-first=William|title=The World's Writing Systems|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=8 February 1996|isbn=0-19-507993-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

For example, a distinguishing feature of the [[Iron Age]] Old [[Hebrew script]] is that the letters ''bet'', ''dalet'', '''ayin'' and ''resh'' do not have an open head, but contemporary [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] has open-headed forms. Similarly, the ''bet'' of Old Hebrew has a distinctive stance (it leans to the right), but the ''bet'' of the Aramaic and [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician scripts]] series has a different stance (in both, it leans to the left).  

In 2006, [[Christopher Rollston]] suggested using the term ''isograph'' to designate a feature of the script that distinguishes it from a related script series, such as a feature that distinguishes the script of Old Hebrew from Old Aramaic and Phoenician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rollston|first=Christopher A.|title=Scribal Education in Ancient Israel: The Old Hebrew Epigraphic Evidence|journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research|volume=344|year=2006|pages=47–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''isogloss'' (Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|ἴσος}} ''ísos'' "equal, similar" and {{lang|grc|γλῶσσα}} ''glōssa'' "tongue, dialect, language") is inspired by [[contour line]]s, or isopleths, such as [[isobar (meteorology)|isobars]]. However, the isogloss separates rather than connects points. Consequently, it has been proposed for the term ''heterogloss'' ({{lang|grc|ἕτερος}} ''héteros'' "other") to be used instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sihler|first=Andrew L.|authorlink=Andrew Sihler|title=Language History|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|location=Amsterdam/Philadelphia|year=2000|series=Current issues in linguistic theory|volume=191|page=170|isbn=90-272-3698-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''jab''' is a type of [[punch (combat)|punch]] used in the [[martial arts]]. Several variations of the jab exist, but every jab shares these characteristics: while in a fighting stance, the lead fist is thrown straight ahead and the arm is fully extended.  It is an overhand punch; at the moment of impact, the [[pronation|pronated]] fist is generally held in a horizontal orientation with the palm facing the ground.

==Etymology==
The word jab was first used in 1825, to mean "to thrust with a point." The term is a Scottish variant of the word ''job'', which means "to strike, pierce, thrust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=j&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title= Jab|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses for the jab==

===Defense===
A jab is an integral part of a fighter's defense.  Its speed and power of execution and reach can keep the opponent at a distance, preventing him from charging in.  Defensive jabs can be employed while moving backwards.

===Speed jab===
This jab gives a fighter high mobility and is often used with the intention of scoring points.  Fighters use this variation of the jab when they want to preserve the mobility and balance of their stance.

===Rangefinding jab===
Used in order to establish a feeling for distance, the rangefinding jab is often used to set up a power punch with the other hand. Thus it can help conserve stamina and lower the risk of being countered by allowing the fighter to commit his stronger hand only when he is within proper range.

Boxers have been wobbled by a rangefinding jab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://h11.abload.de/img/vitali62kqe.gif| title=Vitali Klitschko vs. Tamasz Adamek| publisher=Abload GIF|accessdate=2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power jab===
Power can be added to a jab if it is thrown with a moderate step forward.  The drawback to this technique is that it takes the fighter out of his boxing stance, committing him to the punch rather more than the speed jab.  A "pivot jab" is the most powerful jab, one in which the weight shifts almost entirely to the lead foot, which pivots to put the mass of the body behind the punch.  Jabbing from the hip, rather than from a tight guard, will add power to the jab at the expense of speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.expertboxing.com/boxing-techniques/punch-techniques/5-types-of-jabs|title= The 5 Types of Jabs
 |publisher=ExpertBoxing.com|accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jab to the body===
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:WilliamsvsKolle24.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A typical jab in boxing.]] --&gt;
Jabbing to the body is relatively uncommon, because it increases a fighter's vulnerability to a counterpunch.  Typically, the fighter bends at the waist and fires a speed jab to the midsection of his opponent in an attempt at getting the opponent to drop his guard.  It is impractical to put the body weight behind this punch, so power is limited. The jab to the body can be used effectively to counter the opponents lead jab.

===Jab combinations===
*Jabs are often doubled up in an attempt at getting the opponent to compromise his guard.
*"Jabbing on the fly" is a point-scoring maneuver that employs a quick series of speed jabs thrown by a circling fighter.
*Most combinations start with a jab as a way of closing the distance and finding the proper range.  In this context, the jab is referred to as a "set-up jab".
*Many fighters end their combinations with a jab that is designed to stifle counterpunches.

Historians consider some of the best ''jabbers'' in history to be [[Sonny Liston]], [[Larry Holmes]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Hector Camacho]], and [[Sugar Ray Leonard]]. Recent master jabbers include [[Lennox Lewis]] and  [[Wladimir Klitschko]], both coached by the same trainer and able to develop significant power into their jabs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6373">A [[juror]]'s [[oath]] is used to swear in jurors at the beginning of [[jury selection]] or trial. 

==Australia==
In a [[New South Wales]] juror's oath, the juror promises to "...well and truly try and true deliverance make between our Sovereign Lady the Queen and the accused whom you shall have in charge, and a true verdict give according to the evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Discussion Paper 12 (1985) - Criminal Procedure: The Jury in a Criminal Trial|publisher=LawLink|url=http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lrc.nsf/pages/DP12CHP4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western Australia]] each jury has a choice to either "swear by Almighty God" or "solemnly and sincerely declare and affirm" to "give a true verdict according to the evidence upon the issue(s) to be tried by me."

In [[Queensland]] each jury has a choice for an Oath or Affirmation.
The Oath is as follows:
:You will conscientiously try the charges and decide them according to evidence. You will not disclose anything about the Jury's deliberations other than as allowed or required by law. So help you God.
The Affirmation is as follows:
:Do you solemnly, sincerely and truly affirm and declare that you will conscientiously try the charges against the Defendant, and you will decide them according to the evidence. You will also not disclose anything about the Jury's deliberation other than as required by law.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfZGuC2u6uw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=137|title=What happens from jury selection to hearing the evidence - Queensland Courts|date=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
According to the French Code of Penal Procedure, all jurors must individually swear to the following message from the judge presiding the court:	 
:You swear and promise to examine with the most scrupulous attention the charges that will be laid against &lt;the defendant&gt;; to betray neither the interests of the defendant, nor the interests of the society that accuses him, nor the interests of the victim; not to communicate with anybody until you [declare your verdict]; not to listen to hatred, malice, fear or affection; to remember that the defendant is presumed to be innocent and that doubt must benefit him; to decide for yourself according to the charges and the means of defense, according to your conscience and intimate conviction, with the impartiality and firmness that befits an honest and free person, and to keep the secret of the deliberations, even after you cease to be a juror.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=02A91B2997BC3B3595EF0412B7BF2110.tpdjo08v_1?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006576160&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071154&amp;dateTexte=20100727|title=Code de procédure pénale, article 304|date=1 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
A [[New Zealand]] juror's oath reads: "Members of the jury: Do each of you swear by Almighty God (or solemnly, sincerely, and truly declare and affirm) that you will try the case before you to the best of your ability and give your verdict according to the evidence?"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2000/0100/latest/whole.html|title=Jury Amendment Rules 2000 (SR 2000/100)|date=15 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==

In the [[United Kingdom]], each juror can opt either to swear an oath on the holy book of their choice (provisions are made for Christians, Muslims, Sikhs, and Hindus) or to affirm. The oath typically takes the form "I swear [by almighty God/by Allah/by Waheguru/on the Gita] that I will faithfully try the defendant and give a true verdict according to the evidence." Affirmation, which was made available to Quakers and Moravians by the [[Quakers and Moravians Act 1838]] and later extended to anybody who chooses to do so, takes the form "I solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm that I will faithfully try the defendant and give a true verdict according to the evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1978/19/part/II/crossheading/solemn-affirmations|title=Oaths Act 1978|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, a federal juror's oath usually states something to the effect of, "Do you and each of you solemnly swear that you will well and truly try and  a true deliverance make between the United States and ______, the defendant at the bar, and a true verdict render according to the evidence, so help you God?"

[[Jury instruction]]s sometimes make reference to the juror's oath. For example, the Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions developed by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit]] for use by [[U.S. District Court]]s state:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov./downloads/pji10-cir-crim.pdf|title=Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions|pages=9|chapter=Duty to Follow Instructions|author=Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction Committee of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|You, as jurors, are the judges of the facts. But in determining what actually happened–that is, in reaching your decision as to the facts–it is your sworn duty to follow all of the rules of law as I explain them to you.

You have no right to disregard or give special attention to any one instruction, or to question the wisdom or correctness of any rule I may state to you. You must not substitute or follow your own notion or opinion as to what the law is or ought to be. It is your duty to apply the law as I explain it to you, regardless of the consequences. However, you should not read into these instructions, or anything else I may have said or done, any suggestion as to what your verdict should be. That is entirely up to you.

It is also your duty to base your verdict solely upon the evidence, without prejudice or sympathy. That was the promise you made and the oath you took.}}

[[James Duane (law professor)|James Duane]] has said, with regard to the juror's oath, "In federal court it is not even prescribed by statute. It is simply an old tradition judges have made up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Litigation|volume=22|number=4|pages=6-60|date=1996|author=Duane, James|url=http://www.constitution.org/2ll/2ndschol/131jur.pdf|title=Jury Nullification: The Top Secret Constitutional Right}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LTI technology is partly based on the work of the late [[Arthur Lessac]], a Professor of Theater at the State University of New York and the creator of Lessac Kinesensic Training, and LTI has licensed exclusive rights to exploit Arthur Lessac's copyrighted works in the fields of speech synthesis and speech recognition. Based on the view that music is speech and speech is music, Lessac's work and books focused on body and speech energies and how they go together. Arthur Lessac's textual annotation system, which was originally developed to assist actors, singers, and orators in marking up scripts to prepare for performance, is adapted in LTI's speech synthesis system as the basic representation of the speech to be synthesized (Lessemes), in contrast to many other systems which use a phonetic representation.&lt;ref&gt;M. Munro, S. Turner, A. Munro, and K. Campbell [Eds.] (2010), ''Collective Writings on the Lessac Voice and Body Work: A Festschrift,'' Llumina Press. {{ISBN|1605943436}} (specifically the chapter therein called “Use of Lessemes in text-to-speech synthesis” by R. Nitisaroj and G. A. Marple)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“TTS Is Finding Its Way” by Lauren Shopp, posted Nov. 1, 2007): http://www.speechtechmag.com/Articles/Editorial/Feature/TTS-Is-Finding-Its-Way-40067.aspx; viz paragraphs 5 – 7  of “Defining Expression”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lessac, Arthur (1997). ''The use and training of the human voice : a bio-dynamic approach to vocal life (3rd ed.)''. Mountain View, CA: Mayfield Pub.. pp. xv, 291 p. : ill. ; 22 cm.. {{ISBN|1-55934-696-5}}. LCCN 96018629; and Lessac, Arthur (1981, c1978), ''Body wisdom : the use and training of the human body (1st ed.)''. New York, N.Y.: Drama Book Specialists. pp. vii, 278 p. : ill. ; 27 cm.. {{ISBN|0-89676-070-7}}. LCCN 81005472. OCLC 7671791.&lt;/ref&gt; 

LTI’s software has two major components: (1) a linguistic front-end that converts plain text to a sequence of prosodic and phonosensory graphic symbols (Lessemes) based on Arthur Lessac's annotation system, which specify the speech units to be synthesized; (2) a signal-processing back-end that takes the Lessemes as acoustic data and produces human-sounding synthesized speech as output, using unit selection and concatenation.  

LTI’s text-to-speech system came in second in the world-wide Blizzard Challenge 2011 and 2012. The first-place team in 2011 also employed LTI's "front-end" technology, but with its own back-end.&lt;ref&gt;*“Data for the Blizzard Challenge 2011 ... provided by Lessac Technologies” (info included on SynSig page regarding Blizzard Challenge 2011):  http://www.synsig.org/index.php/Blizzard_Challenge_2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Participation in Blizzard Challenge: http://festvox.org/blizzard/bc2011/LESSAC_Blizzard2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Blizzard Challenge, conducted by the [[Language Technologies Institute]] of [[Carnegie Mellon University]], was devised as a way to evaluate speech synthesis techniques by having different research groups build voices from the same voice-actor recordings, and comparing the results through listening tests.  

LTI was founded in 2000 by [[H. Donald Wilson]] (chairman), a lawyer, [[LexisNexis]] entrepreneur and business associate of Arthur Lessac; and [[Gary A. Marple]] (chief inventor), after Marple suggested that Arthur Lessac's  kinesensic voice training might be applicable to computational linguistics. After Wilson’s death in 2006, his nephew John Reichenbach became the firm’s CEO.

'''Macro-Puinavean''' is a hypothetical proposal linking some very poorly attested languages to the [[Nadahup languages|Nadahup family]]. The [[Puinave language]] is sometimes linked specifically with the Nadahup languages ({{sc|aka}} ''[[Maku people (disambiguation)|Maku]]''), as '''Puinave–Maku''', and the [[Maku language of Roraima]] is sometimes connected to the [[Arutani–Sape languages]] (yet again also known as ''Maku'') in a ''Kalianan'' branch, a connection which Kaufman (1990) finds "promising", but there is too little data on these languages to know for sure. [[Hodï language|Hodï]] has been proposed specifically as a sister of Puinave–Nadahup.

Epps (2008)&lt;ref&gt;Patience Epps, 2008. ''A Grammar of Hup''. Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; criticizes the Puinave–Nadahup proposal for relying on inaccurate data, having no clear concept of basic vocabulary, and using an unsystematic mix of Nadahup languages in the comparison. The languages were originally linked simply because they are all called ''Maku'' "babble" by [[Arawakans]]; that is, because they are spoken by [[hunter-gatherer]]s, and since then some linguists have attempted to verify the connection by finding cognates. However, no convincing cognates have yet been found. For example, Rivet and Tastevin claim that the Hup pronoun ''am'' "I" corresponds to Puinave ''am'' "I", but the Hup pronoun ''’am'' means "you"; the Hup pronoun for "I" is ''’ãh''. Other "strikingly similar" pairs, such as Puinave ''ueyu'' "day" and Hup ''uerhó'' (''{{IPA|wæd.hɔ́}}'') "sun", are not particularly convincing, and no regular sound correspondences have been detected.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2140">'''Magne Rommetveit''' (4 October 1918 – 6 January 2009) was a Norwegian lexicographer.

He was born in [[Stord]]. He [[examen artium|finished]] his secondary education in [[Voss]] in 1940 and took the [[cand.philol.]] degree in 1950. He worked as a lexicographer associated with the [[University of Oslo]], and eventually became a [[docent]] and professor of Nynorsk philology from 1978 to 1988. He was involved in ''[[Nynorskordboka]]'' and ''[[Norsk Ordbok (Nynorsk)|Norsk ordbok]]'', but his main work was the agricultural lexicon ''Norsk landbruksordbok''. Commencing the work in 1955, it was published at [[Det Norske Samlaget|Samlaget]] in 1978 with 80,000 entries. He later wrote the more popular book on Nynorsk synonyms, ''Med andre ord''. Published in 1985 as a follow-up of the earlier ''På godt norsk'', it was reissued several times.&lt;ref name=dt1&gt;{{Cite news|title=Magne Rommetveit til minne|last=Lie|first=Tove|date=16 January 2009|work=Dag og Tid|page=27|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dt2&gt;{{Cite news|title=Magne Rommetveit (1918–2009)|last=Lægreid|first=Erling|authorlink=Erling Lægreid|date=16 January 2009|work=Dag og Tid|page=12|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nm.no/tekst.cfm?id=2783|title=Magne Rommetveit er død|last=Lothe|first=Hege|date=9 January 2009|publisher=[[Noregs Mållag]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2009 Russia Maximum Card Nikolai Gogol 01(front).jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Maximum card for birth bicentenary of [[Nikolai Gogol]] where the card, stamp and first day of issue postmark are in concordance]]

In [[philately]] a '''maximum card''' (also known as a maxi-card, or maxicard) is a [[postcard]] with a [[postage stamp]] placed on the picture side of the card where the stamp and card match or are in maximum ''concordance'' (similarity).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.postcrossing.com/blog/2012/03/19/postcard-formats-maxicards|title=Postcard formats: Maxicards|website=www.postcrossing.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.virginstamps.com/world_maximum_cards_maximaphily_cartoline_maximum.html|title=The Wonderful World of Maximum Cards|website=www.virginstamps.com|access-date=2017-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cancellation or postmark is usually related to the image on the front of the card and the stamp.

Not every country issues maximum cards (e.g. USA does not) and some who do (e.g.. Germany) have only a limited number of releases every year whereas others issue maximum cards for every stamp (e.g. Australia).

The collecting of maximum cards is known as [[maximaphily]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5480">Patrick '''Osmund Lewry''' (1929–1987) was a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] who made significant contributions to the [[history of logic]] and the [[philosophy of language]] in the thirteenth century.  Lewry studied mathematical logic under [[Lejewski]] and [[A.N. Prior]] at Manchester (1961–2). From 1962–7 he taught the philosophy of language and logic at Hawkesyard.  He was assigned to the [[Blackfriars, Oxford|Oxford Blackfriars]] in 1967.  Dissatisfaction with teaching led him to work for an Oxford D.Phil. on the logic teaching of [[Robert Kilwardby]].  In 1979 he began the study of the history of grammar, logic and rhetoric at Oxford in the period 1220–1320.  In 1979 he went to the [[Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies]] in [[Toronto]] first as a research associate, then as a senior fellow. He died on 23 April 1987 at the age of 57 at the [[Blackfriars, Oxford|Oxford Dominican House]].

==Work==
Lewry wrote multiple works on Kilwardby's works, and argued that Kilwardby influenced [[Roger Bacon]]'s thoughts. In particular, Kilwardby is argued to have influenced Bacon's theories on epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;Tachau 1988 pp. 12, 25&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Lewry specialized in identifying medieval sources and the attribution of authors for various manuscripts with a special focus on the works attributed to Kilwardby. In one instance, he provided evidence that the work ''Commenti super Priscianum Maiorem'', previously attributed to Kilwardby, was not, in fact, written by the medieval thinker. Later critics have followed his lead and removed any attribution.&lt;ref&gt;Deely 2001 p. 439&lt;/ref&gt; Lewry was not limited to the works of Kilwardby; he also provided evidence regarding works attributed to [[Pseudo-Scotus]].&lt;ref&gt;Read 1993 p. 236–237&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40456">'''Persian verbs''' are very regular compared with those of most European languages. From the two stems given in dictionaries (e.g. ''gir, gereft'' 'take, took', ''nevis, nevešt'' 'write, wrote', ''deh, dād'' 'give, gave' etc.) it is possible to make all the other forms of almost any verb. The main irregularity is that given one stem it is not usually possible to predict the other. Another irregularity is that the verb 'to be' has no stem in the present tense.

Persian verbs are inflected for three singular and three plural persons. The 2nd and 3rd person plural are often used when referring to singular persons for politeness.

There are fewer tenses in Persian than in English. There are about ten tenses in all. The greatest variety is shown in tenses referring to past events. A series of past tenses (''past simple'', ''imperfect'', and ''pluperfect'') is matched by a corresponding series of perfect tenses (''perfect simple'', ''perfect continuous'', and ''perfect pluperfect'' — the last of these made by adding a perfect ending to the pluperfect tense). These perfect tenses are used sometimes much as the English perfect tense (e.g. 'I have done' etc.), but often in an inferential or reportative sense ('apparently I had done' etc.), similar to the perfect tense in Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;Lazard (1985); cf. Johanson &amp; Utas (2000), p. 218; Simeonova &amp; Zareikar (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''present'' tense has a range of meanings (habitual, progressive, punctual, historic). In colloquial Persian this tense is also used with future meaning, although there also exists a separate future tense used in formal styles. In colloquial Persian there are also three progressive tenses (present, past, and perfect).

There are two [[subjunctive mood]] forms, present and perfect. Subjunctive verbs are often used where English uses an infinitive, e.g. 'I want to go' is expressed in Persian as 'I want I may go'.

A perfect participle is made by adding ''-e'' to the second stem. This participle is active in intransitive verbs, e.g. ''rafte'' 'gone', but passive in transitive verbs, e.g. ''nevešte'' 'written (by someone)'. As well as being used to make the perfect tenses, this perfect participle can be used to make the passive of transitive verbs, by adding different parts of the verb ''šodan'' 'to become'.

Compound verbs, such as ''bāz kardan'' 'to open' (lit. 'to make open') and ''yād gereftan'' 'to learn', are very frequently used in modern Persian.

In colloquial Persian, commonly used verbs tend to be pronounced in an abbreviated form, for example ''ast'' 'he is' is pronounced ''e'', ''miravad'' 'he goes' is pronounced ''mire'', and ''miguyam'' 'I say' is pronounced ''migam''.

In Persian the verb usually comes at the end of the clause, although there are sometimes exceptions (for example in colloquial Persian it is common to hear phrases such as ''raftam Tehrān'' 'I went to Tehran' where the destination follows the verb).&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.78, 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infinitives and stems==
Infinitives end in تن (''-tan'') or دن (''-dan''). The principle parts of a verb are the infinitive stem and present stem. The infinitive stem (often called the past stem)&lt;ref&gt;Khomeijani Farahani (1990), p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; is made simply by removing the ن (''-an'') from the infinitive:

* کردن (''kardan'', 'to make/to do') - کرد (''kard'')
* داشتن (''dāštan'', 'to have') - داشت (''dāšt'')
* گرفتن (''gereftan'', 'to take') - گرفت (''gereft'')
* دیدن (''didan'', 'to see') - دید (''did'')
* نوشتن (''neveštan'' 'to write') - نوشت (''nevešt'')
* رفتن (''raftan'' 'to go') - رفت (''raft'')
* شدن (''šodan'' 'to become') - شد (''šod'')

The present stem tends to vary more, and in many common verbs bears little resemblance to the infinitive stem:

* کردن (''kardan'') - کن (''kon'')
* داشتن (''dāštan'') - دار (''dār'')
* گرفتن (''gereftan'') - گیر (''gir'')
* دیدن (''didan'') - بین (''bin'')
* نوشتن (''neveštan'') - نويس (''nevis'')
* رفتن (''raftan'') - رو (''rav'' or ''ro'')
* شدن (''šodan'') - شو (''šav'' or ''šo'')

The present indicative, present subjunctive, and present participle are made from the present stem, other tenses from the infinitive stem. Both stems can be used to make verbal nouns such as گفتوگو ''goftogu'' (or ''goftegu'') 'dialogue', رفت وآمد ''raft o āmad'' 'going and coming', خوش نويس ''xošnevis'' 'calligrapher'.

The infinitive itself differs in usage from the English infinitive; for example, the subjunctive not the infinitive is used in sentences such as 'I want to go' or 'I am able to go'. The Persian infinitive is more like a verbal noun or gerund,&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; used in phrases such as نوشتن اين کتاب ''neveštan-e in ketāb'' 'the writing of this book' or اختراع نوشتن ''exterā'-e neveštan'' 'the invention of writing'.

Note that in the transliteration used in this article, the letter 'x' represents a velar fricative sound, similar to the 'ch' in ''Bach'' or ''Loch Ness'', and 'š' and 'č' represent the sounds of English 'sh' and 'ch'.&lt;ref&gt;The transliteration is that of Windfuhr (1979) and Mace (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participles==
Persian verbs have two participles - perfect and present.

The perfect participle is formed by adding ه ''-e'' to the infinitive stem. It is passive in transitive verbs but active in intransitive verbs (e.g. ''rafte'' 'gone').
* کردن (''kardan'') - کرده (''karde'') 'done' or 'made'
* گرفتن (''gereftan'') - گرفته (''gerefte'') 'taken'
* دیدن (''didan'', to see) - دیده (''dide'') 'seen'
* نوشتن (''neveštan'' 'to write') - نوشته (''nevešte'') 'written'

As well as being used to make the perfect tenses, the perfect participle can be used as an adjective or noun:&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.117.&lt;/ref&gt;
*ماهِ گذشته ''māh-e gozašte'' 'the past month', i.e. 'last month'
*نوشته‌هاى او ''neveštehā-ye u'' 'his writings'

The present participle, which is less common, is formed by adding نده ''-ande'' to the present stem. Usually this is used as an agent noun (e.g. نويسنده ''nevisande'' 'writer'), though sometimes it is a verbal adjective (e.g. سال آينده ''sāl-e āyande'' 'the coming year', i.e. 'next year').&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.116.&lt;/ref&gt; A true participle ending in ''-ān'' (e.g. خندان ''xandān'' 'smiling') also exists for some verbs.&lt;ref&gt;Khomeijani Farahani (1990), p.123.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal endings===
Personal forms of verbs are formed mostly with simple suffixes. The personal suffixes for the present and future tense and the two subjunctive tenses are:
* ـم (''-am'') (first person singular) = 'I'
* ـی (''-i'') (second person singular informal) = 'you sg.'
* ـد (''-ad'') (third person singular informal), colloquially pronounced ''-e'' = 'he, she'
* ـیم (''-im'') (first person plural) = 'we'
* ـید (''-id'') (second person plural), colloquially pronounced ''-in'' = 'you' (plural or polite)
* ـند (''-and'') (third person plural), colloquially pronounced ''-an'' = 'they' or 'he/she' (polite)

The 2nd and 3rd persons plural are often used when referring to singular persons in a polite or formal setting.

The past, imperfect, and pluperfect tenses have very similar endings, except that there is no ending in the 3rd person singular:
* ـم (''-am'') (first person singular)
* ـی (''-i'') (second person singular informal)
* - ( - ) (third person singular informal)
* ـیم (''-im'') (first person plural)
* ـید (''-id'') (second person plural), colloquially pronounced ''-in''
* ـند (''-and'') (third person plural), colloquially pronounced ''-an''

These same endings are used for the verbs هست ''hast'' 'he is' and نيست ''nist'' 'he isn't', despite their being present tenses.

There is no ending in the 3rd person singular, but often in informal speech, the suffix ''-eš'' (lit. 'his/her') is added to supply the gap, e.g. ''goft-eš'' 'he said'.&lt;ref&gt;Khomeijani Farahani (1990), p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The perfect tenses have the following personal endings:
* ـه‌ام (''-e am'') (first person singular)
* ـه‌ای (''-e i'') (second person singular informal)
* ـه‌است (''-e ast'') (third person singular informal); colloquially ''ast'' is usually omitted.
* ـه‌ايم (''-e im'') (first person plural)
* ـه‌ايد (''-e id'') (second person plural)
* ـه‌اند (''-e and'') (third person plural)

Examples of various tenses are given below using the verb کردن ''kardan'' 'to do'. Note that personal pronouns are frequently dropped and are provided here for clarity.

==Present tenses==
===General present===
The present tense is formed by prefixing می ''mi-'' to the present stem with personal endings:

* من می‌کنم ''man mikonam'' 'I do, I am doing, I will do'
* تو می‌کنی ''to mikoni'' 'you sg. do'
* او می‌کند ''u mikonad'' 'he/she does'
* ما می‌کنیم ''mā mikonim'' 'we do'
* شما می‌کنید ''šomā mikonid'' 'you do' - formal or plural
* آنها می‌کنند ''ānhā mikonand'' 'they do'

The negative is made with the prefix ''ne-'', which is stressed: ''man nemikonam'' 'I don't do'.

In classical Persian the present tense is often found without the prefix ''mi-'', but in modern Persian ''mi-'' is always added except in the verb ''dāram'' 'I have', where it is usually omitted.&lt;ref&gt;Khomeijani Farahani (1990), p.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The present tense has various present meanings (general, habitual, progressive, performative); it can also have a future meaning (see below). Colloquially the present tense can also be used as a historical present when narrating events of the past, especially when relating events which occurred suddenly or unexpectedly.&lt;ref&gt;Khomeijani Farahani (1990), p.103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another meaning is the equivalent of an English perfect continuous in sentences such as:
*''yek sāat ast ke montazer-e to hastam'' 'I have been waiting for you for an hour' (lit. 'it is one hour that I am expecting you')&lt;ref&gt;Fallahi (1992), p.753; Khomeijani Farahani (1990), p.147.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present tense of 'to be'===

The present tense of the verb بودن ''budan'' 'to be' is irregular in that it has no present stem. Instead it consists of [[clitic|enclitic]] words which cannot be used without a preceding noun or adjective. They are as follows:

* ام ''am'' 'I am'
* اى ''i'' 'you are'
* است ''ast'' 'he, she, it is' (colloquially pronounced ''e'')
* ايم ''im'' 'we are'
* ايد ''id'' 'you are' (plural or formal)
* اند ''and'' 'they are' (or 'he/she is' - formal)

An example of the use of these is as follows:
*من دختر تو ام؛ این برادر من است؛ تو پدر من ای
:''man doxtar-e to am; in barādar-e man ast; to pedar-e man i''&lt;br /&gt;'I am your daughter; this is my brother; you (sg.) are my father.'

There is also an emphatic form of the present tense of 'to be', which despite being a present tense, has the endings of a past tense as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.97.&lt;/ref&gt;
* هستم ''hastam'' 'I am'
* ھستی ''hasti'' 'you are'
* ھست ''hast'' 'he/she/it is'
* ھستيم ''hastim'' 'we are'
* ھستيد ''hastid'' 'you are' (plural or formal)
* ھستند ''hastand'' 'they are' (or 'he/she is' - formal)

Yet another, but less commonly used, form of the verb 'to be' is ''mibāšam'' 'I am', etc., which has the normal present tense endings.&lt;ref&gt;Khomeijani Farahani (1990), p.31; Mace (2003), p.98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative of the verb 'to be' in modern Persian is ''nistam'' 'I am not', which has the same endings as ''hastam''.&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.99.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present progressive===
The present tense can be reinforced in its progressive meaning by adding the present tense of داشتن ''dāštan'' 'to have' before the main verb. It is used in colloquial Persian only:

* من دارم می‌کنم ''man dāram mikonam'' 'I am doing (at this moment)'
* تو داری می‌کنی ''to dāri mikoni''
* او دارد می‌کند ''u dārad mikonad''
* ما داریم می‌کنیم ''mā dārim mikonim'' 
* شما دارید می‌کنید ''šomā dārid mikonid''
* آنها دارند می‌کنند ''ānhā dārand mikonand''

The two halves of the verb are usually separated by other words, e.g. ''u dārad qazā mixorad'' 'he is eating at the moment'.&lt;ref&gt;Khomeijani Farahani (1990), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no negative.&lt;ref&gt;Windfuhr (1979), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Past tenses==

===Past simple===
The past simple is formed with the infinitive stem and personal endings. There is no ending in the 3rd person singular:
* من کردم ''man kardam'' 'I did'
* تو کردی ''to kardi''
* او کرد ''u kard''
* ما کردیم ''mā kardim''
* شما کردید ''šomā kardid''
* آنها کردند ''ānhā kardand''

The stress in this tense goes on the syllable before the ending, e.g. ''kárdam'', ''geréftam'' 'I took'.&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.83.&lt;/ref&gt; But in a compound verb, the stress goes on the word before the verb, e.g. on ''kār'' in ''kār kardam'' 'I worked'.&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative is made with ''na-'' (stressed): ''man nákardam'' 'I didn't do (it)'.

In addition to its normal meaning of the simple past (e.g. 'he went'), the past simple also has some idiomatic uses in Persian. For example, colloquially it can be used in 'if' and 'when' clauses referring to future time:&lt;ref&gt;Khomeijani Farahani (1990), p.108, 5, 152.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''vaqt-i &lt;u&gt;rasidid&lt;/u&gt; Landan, fowran be mā telefon konid'' 'when you reach London, phone us at once'
*''tā to &lt;u&gt;bargardi&lt;/u&gt;, man nāme-rā nevešte am'' 'by the time you come back I will have written the letter'

Another idiom is ''āmadam!'' 'I'm coming (at once!)'&lt;ref&gt;Khomeinaji Farahani (1990), p.108, 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The past simple tense in Persian is also often used where English might use the perfect to refer to events which have just occurred:
*''havapeymā be zamin &lt;u&gt;nešast&lt;/u&gt;'' 'the plane has just this moment landed'&lt;ref name=YSF&gt;Dehqani-e Tafti, H. ''Yāddāšthāye Safar-e Farang''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''astaqferollāh! az dar vāred &lt;u&gt;šod&lt;/u&gt;!'' 'talk of the devil! he's just come in the door!'&lt;ref name=YSF /&gt;

===Imperfect===
The imperfect is formed by prefixing می ''mi-'' to the simple past:&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.101.&lt;/ref&gt;

* من میکردم ''man mikardam'' 'I was doing, used to do, would do, would have done'
* تو میکردی ''to mikardi''
* او میکرد ''u mikard''
* ما میکردیم ''mā mikardim''
* شما میکردید ''šomā mikardid''
* آنها میکردند ''ānhā mikardand''

The negative has ''ne-'': ''man nemikardam'' 'I was not doing'.

The imperfect of بودن ''budan'' 'to be' and داشتن ''dāštan'' 'to have' do not use the prefix می ''mi-'',&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.101.&lt;/ref&gt; except sometimes when the meaning is 'would be' or 'would have':
* من بودم ''man budam'' 'I was'
* من داشتم ''man dāštam'' 'I had'

The negative of these is made with ''na-'': ''nabudam'' 'I was not'.

As well as its main past habitual or past progressive meaning ('I used to go', 'I was going'), the imperfect in Persian is also used in a conditional meaning ('I would go', 'I would have gone'), for example:
*''agar ān-rā midāneštam, be šomā migoftam'' 'if I knew that, I would tell you' / 'if I had known that, I would have told you'&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.162.&lt;/ref&gt;

It can also be used in sentences expressing unfulfilled wishes concerning the present or the past:&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.167-8.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''del-am mixāst miraftam'' 'I would love to have gone' / 'I would have loved to go' / 'I would love to be going'
*''kāš u zende bud!'' 'I wish he were alive'
*''dust dāštam jā-ye u mibudam!'' 'I would love to have been in his place'

===Past progressive===
In colloquial Persian the progressive aspect of the imperfect tense can be reinforced in its progressive meaning by adding the past tense of داشتن ''dāštan'' before it:&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.103.&lt;/ref&gt;

* من داشتم میکردم ''man dāštam mikardam'' 'I was doing (at that moment)'
* تو داشتی میکردی ''to dāšti mikardi''
* او داشت میکرد ''u dāšt mikard''
* ما داشتیم میکردیم ''mā dāštim mikardim''
* شما داشتید میکردید ''šomā dāštid mikardid''
* آنها داشتند میکردند ''ānhā dāštand mikardand''

When used in a sentence, the two parts of the verb are usually separated by other words, e.g. 
*داشتم فراموشت ميکردم ''dāštam farāmuš-et mikardam'' 'I was beginning to forget you'

There is no negative.

===Pluperfect===
The pluperfect is a compound tense formed from the perfect participle and the simple past of the verb بودن (to be). As well as its ordinary use as a pluperfect, like the imperfect it can also be used in a conditional sense:
* من کرده بودم ''man karde budam'' 'I had done', 'I would have done'
* تو کرده بودی ''to karde budi''
* او کرده بود ''u karde bud''
* ما کرده بودیم ''mā karde budim''
* شما کرده بودید ''šomā karde budid''
* آنها کرده بودند ''ānhā karde budand''

The negative is formed with ''na-'': ''man nakarde budam'' 'I hadn't done'.

The verb ''budan'' 'to be' is not used in the pluperfect tense, the simple past being used instead.&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.86; Khomeijani Farahani (1990), p.132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a continuous version of the pluperfect is found (''man mikarde budam'') but this is rare and not generally used; some Persian grammarians consider it ungrammatical.&lt;ref&gt;Roohollah Mofidi, [http://persianacademy.ir/UserFiles/File/D/07/D-07-02.pdf ''"Budan va dāštan: do fe'l-e istā-ye fārsi"''], p.77.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as its ordinary pluperfect meaning ('he had gone'), the pluperfect can also be used instead of the imperfect in the sense 'would have gone' or 'if (only) he had gone':&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.167-8.&lt;/ref&gt;
* کاش تصادف نکرده بودم ''kāš tasādof nakarde budam!'' 'if only I hadn't had an accident!'
* اگر نیامده بود که آن اتفاق نمی‌افتاد ''agar nayāmade bud ke ān ettefāq nemioftād'' 'if he hadn't come, that incident wouldn't have happened!'&lt;ref&gt;Iraj Pezeshkzad, ''Dāi Jān Nāpoleon''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perfect tenses==
Corresponding to each of the past tenses, Persian has a set of perfect tenses. These tenses are not only used in the ordinary perfect sense ('he has done X', 'he has sometimes done X') but also in colloquial Persian in an inferential or reported sense ('it appears that he did X'),&lt;ref&gt;Boyle (1966), Windfuhr (1979), p.90; Windfuhr (1980), p.281; Lazard (1985); Estaji &amp; Bubenik (2007); Simeonova &amp; Zareikar (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Most other Iranian dialects of the region have a similar use of the perfect tense and it is likely that this is due to areal contact with Turkish, which is also spoken in Iran.

===Perfect simple===
The perfect simple is formed by adding the present-tense suffixes of the verb بودن ''budan'' ('to be') to the perfect participle:

* من کرده ام ''man karde am'' 'I have done'
* تو کرده ای ''to karde i''
* او کرده است ''u karde ast'' (colloquially ''u karde'', with ''ast'' omitted)
* ما کرده ایم ''mā karde im''
* شما کرده اید ''šomā karde id''
* آنها کرده اند ''ānhā karde and''

The negative is made with ''na-'' (stressed): ''man nakarde am'' 'I have not done'.

The perfect tense is used in situations similar to those described for the perfect in English.&lt;ref&gt;Comrie (1976), 52ff.&lt;/ref&gt; One situation is the perfect of result:
*''raside and'' 'they have arrived (and are still here)'&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.118.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''man qalam-am-rā gom karde am'' 'I've lost my pen'&lt;ref&gt;Khomeijani Farahani (1990), p.141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another is the experiential perfect, to describe an event that has happened before (and may happen again):
*''man se bār az Āmrikā didan karde am'' 'I have visited America three times'&lt;ref&gt;Khomeijani Farahani (1990), p.140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another use of the perfect is to describe a situation that has lasted a long time up to now:&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.119.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''mā hamiše be qarb hasad borde im'' 'we have always been envious of the west'&lt;ref&gt;Jalal Al-e Ahmad, ''Qarbzadegi''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''u tamām-e omr-eš injā zendegi karde ast'' 'he has lived here all his life'&lt;ref&gt;Khomeijani Farahani (1990), p.14, 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the English perfect, the Persian perfect is compatible with a past-time adverbial.&lt;ref&gt;Khomeijani Farahani (1990), p.16, 137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simeonova &amp; Zareikar.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used in sentences such as:
*''in xāne dar sāl-e 1939 sāxte šode ast'' 'this house was built in 1939'
*''Manučehr ketāb-rā diruz be u pas dade ast'' 'Manuchehr gave the book back to him yesterday'

Another use which differs from English is in sentences of the type 'it is a long time since X happened':
*''faqat šeš māh ast ke az Englestān &lt;u&gt;āmade&lt;/u&gt;'' 'it is just six months since he came from England'&lt;ref name=YSF /&gt; 

With verbs meaning 'stand', 'sit', 'lie' the perfect can represent a present state:
*''istāde ast'' 'he is standing'&lt;ref&gt;Khomeijani Farahani (1990), p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perfect continuous===
The perfect continuous is made by adding the prefix ''mi-'' to the perfect:
* من ميکرده ام ''man mikarde am'' 'I have been doing'; 'I used to do'

The negative (which is rare) is made with ''ne-'': ''nemikarde am'' 'I have not been doing'.

This tense is not used in the same way in Persian as the English perfect continuous. As noted above, the present, not the perfect is used in sentences of the kind 'I have been waiting for an hour' (lit. 'it is an hour that I am waiting for you'). 

However, it can be used in sentences such as the following referring to events which have been happening repeatedly or continuously for a long time:&lt;ref&gt;cf. Lazard in Johanson &amp; Utas (2000), 219.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''gozašte-ye man hamiše marā ta'qib mikarde ast'' 'my past has always been following me'&lt;ref&gt;Bozorg Alavi, Čašmhā-yaš''&lt;/ref&gt;
*''u sālhā dar in šahr zendegi mikarde'' 'he has lived in this city for years'&lt;ref&gt;Khomeijani Farahani (1990), p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common use which differs from English is to express a situation that no longer exists, that is, it is the equivalent of 'I used to do':
*''man ālmāni harf mizade am, ammā hālā farāmuš karde am'' 'I used to speak German, but now I have forgotten it'&lt;ref&gt;Lazard, in Johanson &amp; Utas (2000), p.218.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It can also be used in an inferential sense,&lt;ref&gt;Windfuhr (1987), p.84; (1987), p.537.&lt;/ref&gt; as in:
*''az muy-e xis-eš peydā bud ke ābtani mikarde'' 'from his wet hair it was evident that he had been bathing'&lt;ref&gt;Jalal Al-e Ahmad, ''Gāvxuni''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''baččehā bāzi &lt;u&gt;mikarde and&lt;/u&gt; ke sedā-ye šomā-rā našenide and'' '(it was no doubt) because the children were playing that they didn't hear you call'&lt;ref&gt;Khomeijani Farahani (1990), p.157.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perfect progressive===
A progressive version of the perfect continuous is also found in colloquial Persian, but it seems only in the 3rd person:&lt;ref&gt;Khomeijani Farahani (1990), p.43f.&lt;/ref&gt;
* او داشته ميکرده ''u dāšte mikarde'' 'apparently he was doing'

It is typically used in an inferential sense (that is, with the idea 'it would seem that...'), for example, in sentences in which the speaker is reporting something he has been told, but did not personally witness, such as the following:
*''&lt;u&gt;dāšte&lt;/u&gt; māšin &lt;u&gt;midozdide&lt;/u&gt;, hesābi zadan-eš; panj ruz bimārestān bude'' '(apparently) he was (caught) stealing a car, they gave him a proper beating; (it seems) he was five days in hospital.'&lt;ref name=Aq&gt;Shams Al-e Ahmad, ''Aqiqe''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perfect pluperfect===
A perfect version of the pluperfect (also known as the 'double perfect')&lt;ref&gt;Windfuhr (1987), p.85; Khomeijani Farahani (1990), p.46ff; Simeonova &amp; Zareikar (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; can be made by changing ''budam'' in the pluperfect to ''bude am''. This is occasionally used in a non-inferential sense, but much more frequently it is inferential:
* من کرده بوده ام ''man karde bude am'' 'I have sometimes been in the position of having done'; 'it seems that I had done'

A typical example of its use is the following:
*''migoft komunist ast... čand-i piš se mah-i &lt;u&gt;rafte bude&lt;/u&gt; Mesr'' 'he told me that he was a communist ... (it would seem that) some time previously he had gone to Egypt for about three months'&lt;ref name=XDM&gt;Jalal Al-e Ahmad, ''Xas-i dar Miqāt''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future tenses==
The future tense is formed by adding a shortened version of the infinitive, identical with the infinitive stem, to the verb خواهم ''xāham'' 'I want'. It is rarely used in colloquial Persian, since the present tense is usually used with a future meaning instead (especially with verbs of motion):&lt;ref&gt;Fallahi (1999), p.69; Khomeijani Farahani (1990), p.115, Mace (2003), p.100; Phillott (1919), p.508.&lt;/ref&gt;
* خواهم کرد ''xāham kard'' 'I will do' 
* خواهی کرد ''xāhi kard''
* خواهد کرد ''xāhad kard''
* خواهيم کرد ''xāhim kard''
* خواهيد کرد ''xāhid kard''
* خواهند کرد ''xāhand kard''

The positive verb is stressed on the personal ending: ''xāhám kard''.&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.31.&lt;/ref&gt; The negative is ''naxāham kard'' 'I will not do', with stress on ''ná-''.

There is no distinction between simple and continuous in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Fallahi (1999), p.60, 63.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also no future perfect. To represent the future perfect (e.g. 'I will have finished') Persian uses either the future simple or colloquially the perfect simple:&lt;ref&gt;Fallahi (1999), p.62-3.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''tā jom'e tamām xāham kard'' 'I shall have finished by Friday'
*''tā jom'e tamām karde am'' 'I shall have finished by Friday'

Another way of expressing future in colloquial Persian is to use a form meaning literally 'he wants to do it' in the sense 'he is about to do it', for example:
*''havāpeymā mixād parvāz kone'' 'the plane is about to take off'&lt;ref&gt;Fallahi (1999), p.66.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''havāpeymā mixāst parvāz kone'' 'the plane was about to take off'

There are also other expressions used for referring to the future, such as ''qarār ast'' 'it is arranged' or ''tasmim dāram'' 'I'm intending to', followed by the subjunctive:&lt;ref&gt;Fallahi (1999), p.64ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Ali qarār est fardā biyāyad'' 'Ali is to come tomorrow'
*''man tasmim dāram sāl-e āyande yek āpārtmān bexaram'' 'I'm going to buy an apartment next year'

The present tense is also frequently used with future reference, but especially of verbs of motion or arriving. A time adverbial is also required to avoid ambiguity:&lt;ref&gt;Fallahi (1999), p.69.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''barādar-am fardā be Širāz miravad'' 'my brother is going to Shiraz tomorrow'

==Subjunctive tenses==
===Present subjunctive===
The present subjunctive is formed from by prefixing بـ ''be-'' to the present stem with personal endings, e.g. ''benevisam'' 'I may write'. When the verb has the vowel ''o'' this changes to ''bo-'':&lt;ref name=M108&gt;Mace (2003), p.108.&lt;/ref&gt;

*  بکنم ''bokonam'' 'that I do, I may do'
*  بکنی ''bokoni''
*  بکند ''bokonad''
*  بکنیم ''bokonim'' 
*  بکنید ''bokonid''
*  بکنند ''bokonand''

When used as part of a compound verb, the prefix ''be-'' is sometimes omitted, e.g. چکار کنم ''če kār konam?'' 'what am I to do?'

The negative also lacks the prefix ''be-'': ''nakonam'' 'that I not do'.

The present subjunctive of the verb بودن 'to be' is باشم ''bāšam'', with the same endings as above. The present subjunctive of the verb داشتن 'to have' is usually replaced by the perfect subjunctive داشته باشم ''dāšte bāšam''.&lt;ref name=M108 /&gt;

The present subjunctive is very common in Persian. It is used whenever it is uncertain whether an event will take place, or whether a situation is true, e.g.&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.148.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*شاید بروم ''šāyad beravam'' 'maybe I'll go'
*ممکن است که بيايد ''momken ast ke biyāyad'' 'it is possible that he will come'
*اگر بروم می دوم ''agar beravam, midavam'' 'if I go, I will run'
*اميد است که حالت خوب باشد ''omid ast ke hāl-et xub bāšad'' 'I hope you are well'

It is used for indefinite relative clauses such as the following:&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.155.&lt;/ref&gt;
*آيا کسی هست که فارسی بلد باشد؟ ''āyā kas-i hast ke fārsi balad bāšad?'' 'is there anyone who knows Persian?'

The subjunctive is also used after phrases such as ''qabl az inke'' 'before...' (of future or past time), ''tā'' 'until...' (of future time only), ''tā'' 'so that':&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), pp.156-9.&lt;/ref&gt;
*قبل ازاينکه برويد، اين را امضا کنيد ''qabl az in ke beravid, in-rā emzā konid'' 'before you go, sign this'

It is also used instead of an infinitive after verbs such as 'I want', 'I can', 'I must', 'it is possible that', and in indirect commands:&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.109, 150.&lt;/ref&gt;
*باید بروم ''bāyad beravam'' 'I must go'
*فرمود که حمله کنند ''farmud ke hamle konand'' 'he ordered them to attack'

===Perfect subjunctive===
The perfect subjunctive is formed by adding ''bāšam'' to the perfect participle. One of the main uses is in sentences referring to an event or state in the past about which there is an element of doubt:&lt;ref&gt;Lambton (1963), p.153; Khomeijani Farahani (1990), p.161.&lt;/ref&gt;
*گمان می‌کنم رفته باشد''gomān mikonam rafte bāšad'' 'I think he may have gone'
*او باید اشتباه کرده باشد''u bāyad eštebāh karde bāšad'' 'he must have made a mistake'
*امیدوارم که دیر نکرده باشم''omidvār-am ke dir nakarde bāšam'' 'I hope I'm not too late'
*می‌ترسم او رفته باشد''mitarsam u rafte bāšad'' 'I'm afraid he may have gone'&lt;ref&gt;Boyle (1966), p.69.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used for wishes:&lt;ref&gt;Khomeijani Farahani (1990), p.161.&lt;/ref&gt;
*کاش رفته باشد''kāš rafte bāšad!'' 'if only he were gone'

The negative is made with ''na-'': ''nakarde bāšam'' 'that I have not done'.

===Imperative===
The imperative (command) is similar to the subjunctive, except that the 2nd person singular has no ending:
* بنويس ''benevis!'' 'write!'
* بنويسيد ''benevisid'' 'write!' (plural or formal)

The negative lacks the prefix ''be-'': ''nanevis!'' 'do not write!'.

If the present stem ends in ''-av'', as in ''rav'' 'go', this changes in the imperative singular to ''-o'':
* برو ''boro!'' 'go!'

The imperative of the verb ''dāštan'' 'to have' generally uses the perfect subjunctive form:
* داشته باش ''dāšte bāš!'' 'have!'

===Optative===
Although it mostly appears in classical Persian literature, the [[Optative mood|optative]] mood is sometimes used in common Persian. It is formed by adding ''-ād'' to the present stem: 
* کردن / کن ''kardan (kon-)'' 'to do' → Present Stem کن ''kon''- → کناد ''konād'' ('may s/he do it!').  To negate it a prefix ''ma-'' is added: مکناد ''makonād'' ('may s/he not do that! we wish it will never happen') (= نکند ''nakonad'' in Modern Persian).

Although in general, this inflection has been abandoned, yet remnants of its usage can be observed in colloquial expressions such as ''harče bādā bād'' (هرچه بادا باد) 'come what may' and ''dast marizād'' (دست مريزاد) lit. 'may that hand not spill [what it is holding]', meaning 'well done'.

==Passive voice==
Transitive verbs in Persian can be made passive by adding different tenses of the verb ''šodan'' 'to become' to the perfect participle, e.g.&lt;ref name=M129&gt;Mace (2003), p.129.&lt;/ref&gt;
''nāme nevešte (na)šode ast'' 'the letter has (not) been written'
''nāme nevešte xāhad šod'' 'the letter will be written'

In the subjunctive, the prefix ''be-'' is usually omitted:&lt;ref name=M129 /&gt;
''nāme bāyad nevešte šavad'' 'the letter must be written'

In compound verbs, the light verb ''kardan'' is simply replaced with ''šodan''. For example, from ''čāp kardan'' 'to print' is made:
''āgahi diruz čāp šod'' 'the letter was printed yesterday'&lt;ref name=M129 /&gt;

== Intransitive, Transitive and Causative ==
Like English verbs, Persian verbs are either [[Transitive verb|transitive]] (requiring an [[Object (grammar)|object]]) or [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]]. In Persian an [[Accusative case|accusative]] marker (enclitic), را ''rā'', comes after any definite direct object:
* Intransitive:  دویدم ''davidam'' = 'I ran'. 
* Transitive: او را دیدم ''u-rā didam'' = 'I saw him'

Note: If the direct object is indefinite, no را ''rā'' is needed. Example:
* cf.  مردی دیدم ''mard-i didam'' = 'I saw a man'

An intransitive verb can be turned into a transitive one by making it into a causative verb. This is done by adding ''-ān-'' (in the past tense ''-ānd-'') to the present stem of the verb. For example:
* Intransitive verb: خوابیدن ''xābidan'' (present stem: خواب ''xāb-'') 'to sleep' →  خوابیدم ''xābidam'' = 'I slept'. 
* Causative form: خواباندن ''xābāndan'' 'to cause to sleep' → او را خواباندم ''u-rā xābāndam'' = 'I caused him to sleep' ≈ 'I put him to bed'.
 
There are also cases where a causative verb is formed from a transitive verb:
* Transitive verb خوردن ''xordan'' (خور xor-) (to eat) → Causative: خوراندن ''xorāndan'' ('to make eat') ≈ 'to feed'.

Causative verbs are not comprehensively productive, but are applied to certain verbs only.

==Colloquial pronunciation==
In colloquial Persian, many of the most commonly used verbs are pronounced in an abbreviated form; and ''ān'' and ''ām'' many become ''un'' and ''um''. Here are some examples:&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.84.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ast'' &gt; ''e'' 'he is'
*''mideham'' &gt; ''midam'' 'I give'
*''miravam'' &gt; ''miram'' 'I go'
*''mixānam'' &gt; ''mixunam'' 'I read'
*''miyāyam'' &gt; ''miyām'' 'I come'
*''āmadam'' &gt; ''umadam'' 'I came'
*''mišavam'' &gt; ''mišam'' 'I become'
*''mišavad'' &gt; ''miše'' 'he becomes'
*''mitavānam'' &gt; ''mitunam'' 'I can'
*''miguyad'' &gt; ''mige'' 'he says'

==Compound verbs==
Many verbs nowadays are compound verbs and many old simple verbs have been replaced by a compound.&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.124ff; Khomeijani Farahani (1990), pp.47ff.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most frequent verbs (known as [[light verb]]s) used to form compound verbs is کَردَن ''kardan'' 'to do, to make'.  For example, the word صُحبَت ''sohbat'' (originally from Arabic) means 'conversation', while صُحبَت کَردَن ''sohbat kardan'' means 'to speak'. Only the [[light verb]] (e.g. کَردَن ''kardan'') is conjugated; the word preceding it is not affected. For example:                                                                                                     
*صُحبَت میکُنَم ''sohbat mikonam'' 'I speak' or 'I am speaking' (as in the ability to speak a language)
*دارَم صُحبَت میکُنَم ''dāram sohbat mikonam'' 'I am speaking'
*صُحبَت کَردهاَم ''sohbat karde am'' 'I have spoken'
*صُحبَت خواهَم کَرد ''sohbat xāham kard'' 'I will speak'

Some other light verbs used to form compound verbs are: 
*دادن ''dādan'' ('to give') as in ''rox dādan'' 'to happen'
*گرفتن ''gereftan'' ('to take') as in ''yād gereftan'' 'to learn'
*زدن ''zadan'' ('to hit') as in ''harf zadan'' 'to talk, to speak'
*خوردن ''xordan'' ('to eat') as in ''zamin xordan'' 'to fall down'
*شدن ''šodan'' ('to become') as in ''ārām šodan'' 'to calm down'
*داشتن ''dāštan'' ('to have') as in ''dust dāštan'' 'to love'

Some other examples of compound verbs with کَردَن ''kardan'' are:

*فِکر کَردَن ''fekr kardan'' 'to think'
*فَراموش کَردَن ''farāmuš kardan'' 'to forget'
*گَریه کَردَن ''gerye kardan'' 'to cry'
*تَعمیر کَردَن ''ta'mir kardan'' 'to repair'

Equivalents for فِکر کَردَن ''fekr kardan'' and گَریه کَردَن ''gerye kardan'' are پنداشتن ''pendāštan'' and گریستن ''geristan'', which are normally used in a literary context rather than in daily conversation.

==Auxiliary Verbs==
The following auxiliary verbs are used in Persian:
*بایَد ''bāyad'' - 'must': Not conjugated. Followed by a subjunctive.
*شایَد ''šāyad'' - 'might': Not conjugated. Followed by a subjunctive.
*تَوانِستَن ''tavānestan'' - 'can': Conjugated. Followed by a subjunctive.
*خواستَن ''xāstan'' - 'want': Conjugated. Followed by a subjunctive.
*خواهَد ''xāham'' - 'will': Conjugated. Followed by the short infinitive.

==Tenses in indirect speech==
In indirect sentences introduced by a past-tense verb (e.g. 'he said that...', 'he asked whether...', 'it was obvious that...'), if the second verb refers to a situation simultaneous with, or an event shortly to follow, the main verb, the present tense is used in Persian. It does not change to a past tense as in English:&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), pp.147ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''migoft (ke) komunist &lt;u&gt;ast&lt;/u&gt;'' 'he said (that) he was a communist'&lt;ref name=XDM /&gt;

If the second verb refers to a time earlier than the second verb, it is common to use one of the perfect tenses for the second verb:
*''ma'lum šod ke hads-am dorost &lt;u&gt;bude ast&lt;/u&gt; va re'is-e farhang &lt;u&gt;gofte bude&lt;/u&gt;...'' 'it become obvious that my guess had been correct and that the Director of Education had said...'&lt;ref&gt;Jalal Al-e Ahmad, ''Modir-e Madrase''.&lt;/ref&gt;

However the pluperfect can be used if the fact is certain:
*''fahmidam ke rafte bud Ālmān'' 'I realised that he had been to Germany'&lt;ref name=Aq /&gt;

If the second verb merely represents an idea rather than a statement of fact, or a wish or a possibility, the subjunctive is used:&lt;ref&gt;Mace (2003), p.151.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''heyf ast ke barf nabāšad'' 'it's a pity that there's no snow'
*''omidvār-am ke zud biāyand'' 'I hope they come soon'

'''Persuasive writing''' intends to convince readers to believe in an idea and to do an action. Many writings such as critics, reviews, reaction papers, editorials, proposals, advertisements, and brochures use different ways of persuasion to influence readers.

==Three common techniques in persuasive writing==

'''1.''' Presenting strong evidence, such as facts and statistics, statements of expert authorities, and research findings establishes credibility. Readers will more likely be convinced to side with the writer’s position or agree with his or her opinion if it is backed up by verifiable evidence. 

'''2.''' Concrete, relevant, and reasonable examples can enhance the writer’s idea or opinion. They can be based on observations or from the writer’s personal experience. 

'''3.''' Accurate, current, and balanced information adds to the credibility of persuasive writing. The writer does not only present evidence that favor his or her ideas, but he or she also acknowledges some evidence that opposes his or her own. In the writing, though, his or her ideas would be sounder.

==Ethos, logos, and pathos==
'''Ethos''' is the appeal to ethics. It convinces the audience of the credibility of the writer. The writer’s expertise on his or her subject matter lends to such credibility. The level of education and profession of the writer also come into play.

'''Logos''' is the appeal to logic and reason. It is the most commonly accepted mode in persuasion because it aims to be scientific in its approach to argumentation. In writing, facts are presented in a logical manner, and faulty logic is avoided.

'''Pathos''' is the appeal to emotion. This aims to convince the audience by appealing to human emotions. Emotions such as sympathy, anger, and sadness motivate humans; using pathos will then get the audience to be emotionally invested in the subject of the writing.

'''Pokrovsk Raion''' ({{lang-uk|Покровський район}}; {{lang-ru|Покровский район}}), formerly '''Krasnoarmiisk Raion''' ({{lang-uk|Красноармійський район}}; {{lang-ru|Красноармейский район}}) is a [[raion]] ([[district]]) within [[Donetsk Oblast]] in eastern [[Ukraine]]. Its [[capital city|administrative center]] is [[Pokrovsk, Ukraine|Pokrovsk]], which is incorporated separately as a [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]] and does not belong to the raion. Its area is {{convert|1,316|km2|abbr=on}} and its population is approximately {{Ua-pop-est2017|30,653}}.

Within the Dobropilskyi Raion there are: 3 [[urban-type settlement]]s (Hrodivka, Novoekonomichne and Udachne), 13 [[selsoviet]]s, and 99 settlements. Also included within the raion are: 22 [[kolkhoz]]y, 7 [[sovhoz]]y, 5 industrial organizations, 3 hospitals, 36 schools, and 31 libraries.

An architectural monument in the raion is the Petropavlovs'ka Church (1840 – village of Krasne), Church of the Birth of the [[Theotokos]] ({{lang-ru|церковь Рождества Богородицы}}) (1799 – urban-type settlement of Novoekonomichne), and the Voznesens'ka Church (1893 – village of Novotroyits'ke). The composer [[Sergei Prokofiev]] (1891–1953) was born here.

In May 2014, the raion requested a referendum for its absorption into the [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]], citing the instability in the Donetsk Oblast and order and stability in Dnipropetrovsk. Dnipropetrovsk governor Ihor Kolomoisky said that the oblast was willing to do so, assuming it was popular opinion in the raion.

On 21 May 2016, [[Verkhovna Rada]] adopted decision to rename Krasnoarmiisk Raion to Pokrovsk Raion and Krasnoarmiisk to Pokrovsk according to the law prohibiting names of Communist origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.golos.com.ua/article/269361|title=Pro perejmenuvannja dejakih naselenih punktiv|date=21 May 2016|publisher=[[Holos Ukrainy]]|language=Ukrainian|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Power-knowledge''' ({{lang-fr|le savoir-pouvoir}}) is a [[concept]] coined by the French [[philosopher]] [[Michel Foucault]].

== Definition ==
According to Foucault's understanding of power, power is based on knowledge and makes use of knowledge; on the other hand, power reproduces knowledge by shaping it in accordance with its anonymous intentions. Power (re-) creates its own fields of exercise through knowledge.

Foucault incorporates this inevitable mutuality into his [[neologism]] power-knowledge, the most important part of which is the hyphen that links the two aspects of the integrated concept together (and alludes to their inherent inextricability).

It is helpful noting that Foucault has a textual understanding of both power and knowledge. Both power and knowledge are to be seen as de-centralised, relativistic, ubiquitous, and unstable (dynamic) systemic phenomena. Thus Foucault's concept of power draws on micro-relations without falling into [[reductionism]] because it does not neglect, but emphasizes, the systemic (or structural) aspect of the phenomenon.

However, he does not actually define knowledge.

== Implications ==
According to this understanding, knowledge is never neutral, as it determines force relations. The notion of power-knowledge is therefore likely to be employed in critical, normative contexts.

== History of the term ==
In his later works, Foucault suggests that power-knowledge was later replaced in the modern world, with the term [[governmentality]] which points to a specific mentality of governance.

{{British Royal Family}}

'''Prince Michael of Kent''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|sep=,|size=100|GCVO|KStJ|CD}} (Michael George Charles Franklin; born 4 July 1942) is a member of the [[British royal family]]. He is a paternal first cousin of [[Queen Elizabeth II]], being a [[Descendants of George V and Mary of Teck|grandson]] of [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. He is currently 47th in the [[line of succession to the British throne]], but at the time of his birth was seventh in the line of succession.

Prince Michael occasionally represents the Queen at some functions in [[Commonwealth realm]]s outside the United Kingdom. Otherwise, he manages his own consultancy business and undertakes various commercial work around the world. He has also presented some television documentaries on the royal families of Europe.

==Early life==
Prince Michael was born during the [[Second World War]] on 4 July 1942, at [[Coppins]], [[Iver]], Buckinghamshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35623 |date=7 July 1942 |page=2987 |nolink=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the third child of [[Prince George, Duke of Kent]], who was a son of [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] and a younger brother of [[King George VI]]. At the time of his birth Michael was seventh in the [[line of Succession to the British throne]]. His mother was [[Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark|Princess Marina]], a daughter of [[Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark]] and [[Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia]].

At his christening on 4 August 1942 in the Private Chapel of [[Windsor Castle]], his godparents were: his paternal uncle the King; the [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen of the Netherlands]] (for whom her son-in-law [[Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld|Prince Bernhard]] stood proxy); the [[Haakon VII of Norway|King of Norway]] (his great-uncle); US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (for whom the Duke of Kent stood proxy);&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;{{cite web|title=Invitation to FDR to become Godfather|url=http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box36/a327y02.html|website=Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Frederica of Hanover|Hereditary Princess of Greece]] (who was not present), the wife of [[Paul of Greece]], his first cousin-once-removed; the [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester|Duke of Gloucester]] (his paternal uncle, who was absent); the [[Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine|Dowager Marchioness of Milford Haven]] (his paternal first cousin twice-removed); and [[Princess Patricia of Connaught|Lady Patricia Ramsay]] (his paternal first cousin twice-removed). Because of the war, newspaper reports did not identify the location of the christening and said instead that it took place at "a private chapel in the country".&lt;ref name="times"&gt;[[The Times]], 5 August 1942&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yvonne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm#Christenings|title=Yvonne's Royalty Home Page: Royal Christenings|website=users.uniserve.com|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Just seven weeks after Michael's birth, his father was killed in a [[plane crash]] near [[Caithness]], Scotland, on 25 August 1942.

At the age of five, Prince Michael was a [[Page boy (wedding attendant)|page boy]] at the wedding of his cousins, [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten]].&lt;ref name="60facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page6118.asp |title=Royal.gov.uk – 60 Facts, Fact 9 |publisher= |accessdate=27 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204820/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page6118.asp |archivedate=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and military service==
[[File:Etoncollege.JPG|thumb|right|Eton College]]

He was educated at [[Sunningdale School]] and [[Eton College]].&lt;ref name="edu" /&gt; Besides being fluent in French and having a "working knowledge"&lt;ref name="edu" /&gt; of German and Italian, he was the first member of the royal family to learn Russian.&lt;ref name="edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=The current Royal Family|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/PrinceandPrincessMichaelofKent/Earlylifeandeducation.aspx|website=Official Website of the British Monarchy|accessdate=4 February 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501201239/http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/PrinceandPrincessMichaelofKent/Earlylifeandeducation.aspx|archivedate=1 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Michael entered the [[Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst]], in January 1961, from where he was commissioned into the [[11th Hussars (Prince Albert's Own)]], in 1963, he later served in [[The Royal Hussars (Prince of Wales's Own)]] after the 1969 amalgamation between the 11th Hussars and the [[10th Royal Hussars (Prince of Wales's Own)]]. He saw service in Germany, [[Hong Kong]], and [[Cyprus]], where his squadron formed part of a United Nations peacekeeping force in 1971. Subsequent tours of duty, during a military career that spanned twenty years, included a number of appointments on the [[Defence Intelligence Staff]]. He retired from the Army with the rank of [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=48589 |date=21 April 1981 |page=5767 |supp=y |nolink=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debretts.com/people/royal-family/biographies/prince-michael-kent|title=Prince Michael of Kent, Biographies, The Royal Family, People of Influence|publisher=[[Debrett's]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141120193701/http://www.debretts.com/people/royal-family/biographies/prince-michael-kent|archivedate=20 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Prince Michael was made Honorary [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]] (later Honorary Rear Admiral and currently Vice Admiral) of the [[Royal Naval Reserve]], and in 2002 he was made Honorary [[Air Commodore]] of [[RAF Benson]] (promoted to Honorary Air Marshal in 2012). From 2009 to 2012 he was Regimental Colonel of the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] and has been, since 31 January 2012, Royal Honorary Colonel of that regiment.&lt;ref name="LG60084 SUP"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=60084 |date=13 March 2012 |page=4993 |supp=y |nolink=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of the [[Essex and Kent Scottish Regiment]] in Canada.

==Activities and patronages==
[[File:Michael of Kent.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Prince Michael of Kent in 2008]]

As the third child of George V's fourth son, it was not expected that Prince Michael, as the only second son in the extended royal family, would undertake many engagements on behalf of the royal family. He has performed official duties in the Commonwealth realms other than the United Kingdom and has represented the Queen abroad.

He has, however, never received a [[Civil List|parliamentary annuity]] or an allowance from the British [[Privy Purse]], unlike both his elder brother, [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]], and his sister, [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra]], who both carry out official royal duties in the United Kingdom and receive British parliamentary annuities.

==Marriage==
[[File:HRH Prince Michael of Kent 6 Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|upright|Prince Michael, photographed by [[Allan Warren]].]]
On 30 June 1978, Prince Michael was married, at a civil ceremony, at the [[Rathaus, Vienna]], [[Austria]], to [[Princess Michael of Kent|Baroness Marie Christine von Reibnitz]], the only daughter of the [[Silesia]]n nobleman [[Gunther von Reibnitz|Baron Gunther Hubertus von Reibnitz]] and of his [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] wife, Maria Anna Carolina Franziska Walpurga Bernadette, Countess [[Szapáry]] de Muraszombath, Széchysziget et Szapár. After receiving [[Pope John Paul II]]'s permission, the couple later received a blessing of their marriage in a Roman Catholic ceremony on 29 June 1983 at [[Archbishop of Westminster|Archbishop's House, London]].

At the time of the marriage, Marie Christine von Reibnitz was not only a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], but also a divorcée. She had previously been married to the banker Thomas Troubridge; they separated in 1973, divorced in 1977, and had their marriage annulled by the Roman Catholic Church a year later, two months before her marriage to Prince Michael. Under the terms of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], Prince Michael forfeited his place in the line of succession to the throne through his marriage to a Roman Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;Picknett, Lynn, Prince, Clive, Prior, Stephen &amp; Brydon, Robert, ''War of the Windsors: A Century of Unconstitutional Monarchy'' (2002), p. 271. Mainstream Publishing. {{ISBN|1-84018-631-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was reinstated to the line of succession on 26 March 2015 with the coming into force of the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]], and is 47th in line to the throne {{as of|2018|06|lc=y}}.

Prince and Princess Michael of Kent have two children, both of whom were brought up as members of the [[Church of England]], and have therefore been in the line of succession to the throne since birth:

* [[Lord Frederick Windsor]], born 6 April 1979 at [[St Mary's Hospital, London]]; married, 12 September 2009, [[Sophie Winkleman]]. Educated at Eton College and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. They have two daughters, Maud and Isabella.
* [[Lady Gabriella Windsor]], born 23 April 1981 at [[St Mary's Hospital, London]]. Educated at Downe House, Brown University in the US, and [[Linacre College, Oxford]].

They share the same great-grandfather, [[Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich]]. The Prince is the patron of organisations which has close ties with Russia, including the Russo-British Chamber of Commerce and the St Gregory's Foundation.&lt;ref name="Russia-Official"/&gt; In his capacity as patron of Children's Fire and Burns Trust, Michael has led fundraising rallies in 1999 and 2003 in Russia to raise money for the charity. He also led another rally in 2005 and raised money for the [[Royal Marsden Hospital]] and Britain's Charities Aid Foundation Russia.&lt;ref name="Russia-Official"/&gt;

===Sport===
Prince Michael was a part of the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] rowing team that won the Maiden Fours at Bedford in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princemichael.org.uk/the-prince/activities-interests/|title=Activities &amp; Interests|publisher=Prince Michael of Kent's official website|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Michael competed for Great Britain in the 1971 FIBT World Bobsleigh Championships but crashed and failed to finish the event. He was official non-travelling reserve for the [[1972 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref name="times2"&gt;[[The Times]], 21 January 1972&lt;/ref&gt; He took part in the [[1970 London to Mexico World Cup Rally]] in an Austin Maxi, but he and his crew failed to finish the event.

==Controversy==

In 2002, both Prince and Princess Michael of Kent were the subject of criticism over the rent paid on their accommodation at Kensington Palace following scrutiny by the [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|House of Commons Public Accounts committee]] on the cost of royal palaces and whether they were value for money.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2586227.stm&lt;/ref&gt; The committee had called on the Queen to evict its residents and put the apartments on a more commercial footing. When it was claimed that the couple paid a rent of only £69 per week for the use of their apartments at Kensington Palace, Buckingham palace announced that "The Queen is paying the rent for Prince and Princess Michael of Kent's apartment at a commercial rate of £120,000 annually, from her own private funds. This rent payment by The Queen is in recognition of the Royal engagements and work for various charities which Prince and Princess Michael of Kent have undertaken at their own expense, and without any public funding."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page3956.asp |title=Corrections to inaccurate media stories about the Royal Family |publisher=Official website of the British monarchy |accessdate=27 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303174815/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page3956.asp |archivedate=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Michael has been under close scrutiny by the media for financial assistance given to him by Russian oligarch [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hui|first=Sylvia|title=Queen's cousin given financial assistance by exiled Russian tycoon|url=https://news.yahoo.com/queens-cousin-given-financial-assistance-exiled-russian-tycoon-153711225.html|work=Associated Press|publisher=yahoo.com|date=13 May 2012|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, ''The Sunday Times'' reported that the Prince had received £320,000 during a six-year period from 2002 to 2008 into a family business owned by the prince's secretary, from a fund controlled by Berezovsky, in which 56 payments of between £5,000 and £15,000 were sent through offshore companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Michael Gifted 320,000 pounds by Berezovsky – paper|url=https://sputniknews.com/world/20120513173425576/|website=sputniknews.com|publisher=Sputnik International|date=13 May 2012|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''The Sunday Times'' Berezovsky stated, "There is nothing underhand or improper about the financial assistance I have given Prince Michael.

The '''Kremna Prophecies''' or '''Prophecy from Kremna''' are a collection of [[prophecy|prophecies]] purporting to have been written before the twentieth-century events that they describe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/profecias/esp_profecia07c.htm The Prophecies of Mitar Tarabic]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The Kremna Prophecies originated in the village of [[Kremna]], in [[Serbia]]. Illiterate peasants Miloš Tarabić (Милош Тарабић) and his nephew Mitar Tarabić (Митар Тарабић, 1829-1899) built a reputation for predicting the future. Their village [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] priest, Zaharije Zaharić (Захарије Захарић, 1836-1918) is said to have recorded their predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/profecias/esp_profecia07c.htm|title=The Prophecies of Mitar Tarabich|author=Mitar Tarabić, Zaharije Zaharić|work=Nexus Magazine|date=January 2006|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Tarabićes died before 1900. The following simple translations, from Serbo-Croatian to English, were prepared by Robert Gaković.

==Evaluation==
At least one author has questioned whether the "accurate" prophecies were published in advance of the events they foretell: [[Voja Antonić#Non-Prophecy from Kremna - a study of deception|Voja Antonić]] (in [[Serbian language|Serbian]]) in ''Kremansko neproročanstvo: studija jedne obmane'' (''Non-Prophecy from Kremna - a study of deception'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.calameo.com/read/0008207830f8b7ea0daab Non-Prophecy from Kremna - a Study of Deception]&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
'''Publilius Syrus''' ([[fl.]] 85–43 BC&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.ca/books?id=_QQSAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Moral Sayings of Publius Syrus, a Roman Slave: From the Latin]'' trans. D. Lyman. Sketch of the Life of Syrus, page x&lt;/ref&gt;), was a [[Latin]] writer, best known for his [[Sententia|sententiae]]. He was a [[Syria (Roman province)|Syrian]] who was brought as a slave to [[Italy]], but by his wit and talent he won the favour of his master, who freed and educated him. Publilius' name, due to early medieval palatalization of 'l' between two 'i's, is often presented by manuscripts (and some printed editions) in [[Corruption (linguistics)|corrupt form]] as 'Publius'.

==Work==
His [[Mime artist#Greek and Roman mime | mime]]s, in which he acted, had a great success in the provincial towns of Italy and at the games given by [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] in 46 BC. Publilius was perhaps even more famous as an improviser, and received from Caesar himself the prize in a contest in which he vanquished all his competitors, including the celebrated [[Decimus Laberius]].

All that remains of his corpus is a collection of ''[[Sententiae]]'', a series of [[moral]] maxims in [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]] and [[trochaic]] [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]. This collection must have been made at a very early date, since it was known to [[Aulus Gellius]] in the 2nd century AD. Each maxim consists of a single verse, and the verses are arranged in alphabetical order according to their initial letters. In the course of time the collection was interpolated with sentences drawn from other writers, especially from apocryphal writings of [[Seneca the Younger]]. The number of genuine verses is about 700. They include many [[wikt:pithy|pithy]] sayings, such as the famous "''iudex damnatur ubi nocens absolvitur''" ("The judge is condemned when the guilty is acquitted") adopted as its motto by the ''[[Edinburgh Review#Edinburgh Review.2C 1802.E2.80.931929|Edinburgh Review]]''.

==Texts==
As of 1911, the best texts of the ''Sentences'' were those of [[Eduard Wölfflin]] (1869), A. Spengel (1874), and [[Wilhelm Meyer (philologist)|Wilhelm Meyer]] (1880), with complete critical apparatus and ''index verborum''; editions with notes by O. Friedrich (1880), [[R. A. H. Bickford-Smith]] (1895), with full bibliography; see also W. Meyer, ''Die Sammlungen der Spruchverse des Publilius Syrus'' (1877), an important work.

==Influence==
Seneca the Younger strived to develop a "sententious style" like Publilius throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/4341636| jstor = 4341636| title = "Seneca" in the Middle Ages| journal = The Classical Weekly| volume = 36| issue = 13| pages = 151| year = 1943| last1 = Heller | first1 = J. L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quotes Syrus in his'' [[Epistulae morales ad Lucilium|Moral Epistles to Lucilius]]'' in the eighth moral letter, "On the Philosopher's Seclusion"&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 8]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the ninety-fourth, "On the Value of Advice".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 94]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Shakespeare]] in the first scene of the fifth act of ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]],'' has Don Pedro proverbially say: "if she did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Much Ado About Nothing (Shakespeare)#Scene 1. Before LEONATO.27S House.]]&lt;/ref&gt; W.L. Rushton argues that this is derived from [[John Lyly|John Lyly's]] ''[[Euphues]]''. If Shakespeare had not taken this from Lyly, then he and Lyly both derived this expression from Publilius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2914181| jstor = 2914181| title = Much Ado About Nothing (V.

The Muddy Waters song Rollin' Stone was named after the proverb and the Rolling Stones band was named after the Muddy Waters song.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11890">'''Pyrrolizidine alkaloid sequestration''' by [[insect]]s is a strategy to facilitate [[Defense in insects|defense]] and mating. Various species of insects have been known to utilize molecular compounds from [[plants]] for their own defense and even as their [[pheromone]]s or precursors to their pheromones. A few [[Lepidoptera]] have been found to sequester chemicals from plants which they retain throughout their life and some  members of [[Erebidae]] are examples of this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="reddy2004"&gt;{{citation |author1=Reddy, G.V.P. |author2=A. Guerrero  |lastauthoramp=yes | date = 2004 | title = Interactions of insect pheromones and plant semiochemicals | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 9 | pages = 253–261 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2004.03.009 | pmid = 15130551 | issue = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the mid-twentieth century researchers investigated various members of Arctiidae, and how these insects sequester [[pyrrolizidine alkaloid]]s (PAs) during their life stages, and utilize these chemicals as adults for [[pheromones]] or pheromone precursors. PAs are also used by members of the Arctiidae for defense against predators throughout the life of the insect.&lt;ref name="boppre1989" &gt;{{citation | author = Boppre, M | date = 1990 | title = Lepidoptera and Pyrrolizidine alkaloids exemplification of complexity in chemical ecology | journal = Journal of Chemical Ecology | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 165–185 | doi = 10.1007/BF01021277 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Pyrrolizidine alkaloid]]s are a group of chemicals produced by plants as [[secondary metabolite]]s, all of which contain a [[pyrrolizidine]] nucleus. This nucleus is made up of two [[pyrrole]] rings bonded by one carbon and one nitrogen. There are two forms in which PAs can exist and will readily interchange between: a pro-toxic free base form, also called a tertiary [[amine]], or in a non-toxic form of [[N-oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Hartmann, T.  |author2=D. Ober  |lastauthoramp=yes | date = 2000 | title = Biosynthesis and metabolism of pyrrolizidine alkaloids in plants and specialized insect herbivores | journal = Topics in Current Chemistry | publisher = Springerlink | place = Berlin | issn = 0340-1022 | volume = 209 | pages = 207–243 | doi = 10.1007/3-540-48146-X_5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have collected data that strongly suggests that PAs can be registered by [[taste receptor]]s of [[predator]]s, acting as a deterrent from being ingested.&lt;ref name="eisner1987"&gt;{{citation |author1=Eisner, T  |author2=J. Meinwald  |lastauthoramp=yes | date = 1987 | editor = G.J. Blomquist | contribution = Alkaloid-derived pheromones and sexual selection in Lepidoptera | title = Pheromone Biochemistry | place = New York | pages = 251–269. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taste receptors are also used by the various [[moth]] species that sequester PAs, which often stimulates them to feed.&lt;ref name="hartmann2005" /&gt; As of 2005, all of the PA sequestering insects that have been studied have all evolved a system to keep concentrations of the PA pro-toxic form low within the insect’s tissues.&lt;ref name="hartmann2005"&gt;{{citation | author = Hartmann, T., C.

Researchers have found a number of Arctiidae that utilize PAs for protection and for male [[pheromones]] or precursors of the male pheromones, and some studies have found evidence suggesting PAs have behavioral and developmental effects.

Parsimony suggests that the sequestering of PAs in the larval stage evolved in the subfamily Arctiinae common ancestor. The loss of ability to sequester and utilize PAs has occurred in a number of species, along with the switch from larval uptake to adult uptake of PAs occurring multiple times within the Arctiinae taxon.&lt;ref name="hartmann2005" /&gt;
	
Members of [[Arctiidae]] typically sequester PAs from their diets, but sometimes must specifically ingest fluids excreted by plants that are not a part of their diets.&lt;ref name="boppre1989" /&gt; Sequestered PAs are kept in various tissues and varying concentration which is dependent upon the species.&lt;ref name="hartmann2005" /&gt; PAs are found in the [[cuticle]] of all studied [[Arctiidae]] mentioned here, but some also package these chemicals into their [[spermatophore]]s as seen in ''[[Creatonotos gangis]]'' and ''[[Creatonotos transiens]]''.&lt;ref name="boppre1985"/&gt; The display of PAs on the [[exoskeleton]] is believed to cue predators to the unpalatability of the [[prey]].

Eisner and Eisner looked at the palatability of PA positive and negative ''U. ornatrix'' to [[wolf spiders]], ''[[Lycosa ceratiola]]'', in both the larval form and adult form.&lt;ref name="eisner1991"/&gt; They found that the pyrrolizidine-positive organisms were typically released unharmed by spiders except in two field circumstances where the larvae were probably envenomated prior to the spider’s release and died two days after the attack. All of the PA-negative organisms were eaten by spiders. These findings were in line with prior studies done by Eisner and Meinwald which looked at [[orb weavers]] and ''U. ornatrix'', along with spiders being fed [[beetle]] larva covered in PAs, which they rejected.&lt;ref name="eisner1987" /&gt; All of these findings support PAs being utilized for defense against predation.

Studies have further elucidated the defenses and uses of PAs in Arctiidae. One study researched ''C. myrodora'' and how PAs protect this species from spider predation among other things.&lt;ref name="conner2000" /&gt; It found that PAs ingested from fluids excreted by plants aided in defense from predation. All organisms permitted access to PA-containing diets that were fed to spiders were cut loose from the webs. Females that had PA-deprived diets, but were allowed to mate with PA-positive males, were also released from the spider’s webs. Further observations showed that male ''C. myrodora'' have a pair of pouches where they produce PA-laden filaments, which are typically released over the female prior to [[copulation]] as a [[nuptial gift]]. Experiments show that the filaments give the females more PAs, explaining why spiders released mated PA-negative females from their webs. Most of the PAs from the males were subsequently transferred to the eggs when deposited. Three clusters of eggs that were laid after copulation with a PA-positive male all tested positive for alkaloids and the one cluster that resulted from a PA-negative male copulation tested negative. By the eggs getting a dose of PAs, the authors suggest that the eggs are being protected from predators such as [[Coccinellidae]] beetles.&lt;ref name="conner2000" /&gt;

Jordan and others’ study found a very interesting effect of the larval ingestion of PAs. Male ''[[Estigmene acrea]]'' moths that consumed PAs in their diet as larvae produced [[hydroxydanaidal]], a volatile PA compound, and displayed their [[coremata]]: a bifid, inflatable male-specific organ, utilized in dispersing pheromones in the adult stage. Larvae that were fed diets without PAs rarely displayed their coremata and did not produce hydroxydanaidal. E. acrea have been observed in the wild displaying their coremata, an activity which attracts both males and females and is known as ''lekking''. Lekking was described by Willis and Birch in 1982, but larvae raised in the laboratory prior to this study rarely engaged in lekking or corematal displays. Scientists were unsure of why this phenomenon didn’t occur in the lab, but laboratory raised larvae were usually reared on commercially available food which lacks PAs. The authors suggest that the PAs are used by the males to attract other moths by releasing the volatile PA hydroxydanaidal into the air. It is suggested in this study that this strategy of mate attraction came about by tapping into the PA affinity already programmed into the moths for feeding, which is further supported by the observation that E. acrea females release their pheromones a little bit later in the evening than the males.&lt;ref name="jordan2005" /&gt;
	
Similar uses of coremata to attract other moths have been observed in ''C. gangis'' and ''C. transiens'' along with altered development of coremata when larvae are reared without PAs.&lt;ref name="boppre1985" /&gt; Boppre and Schneider observed adult males of these two species that were not permitted to eat PAs. Their coremata only developed into two, stalk-like projections with very few hairs arising from these stalks. Males that were given plants that produced PAs to feed upon, developed long coremata with four tubes, each longer than the males body, and each tube was highly pubescent. The authors suggest from this observation that there is a basic corematal phenotype, the two stalked coremata, and that PAs are required to form full coremata which is much larger and more elaborate than the basic corematal expression. These observations were further investigated by feeding larvae different amounts of PAs which had a direct correlation to the development of the coremata, which reached a maximum plateau around 2&amp;nbsp;mg of PAs ingested while in larval form. Similar to Jordan and others’ findings, the males raised on a diet devoid of PAs did not produce hydroxydanaidal.&lt;ref name="boppre1985" /&gt;

The '''Tolai language''', or '''Kuanua''', is spoken by the [[Tolai people]] of [[Papua New Guinea]], who live on the [[Gazelle Peninsula]] in [[East New Britain]] Province. (This language is often referred to in the literature as ''Tolai''. However, Tolai is actually the name of the cultural group. The Tolais themselves refer to their language as ''a tinata tuna'', which translates as "the real language". ''Kuanua'' is apparently a word in [[Ramoaaina language|Ramoaaina]] meaning "the place over there".)

==Characteristics==
Unlike many languages in Papua New Guinea, Tolai is a healthy language and not in danger of dying out to [[Tok Pisin]], although even Tolai suffers from a surfeit of loanwords from Tok Pisin, e.g. the original ''kubar'' has been completely usurped by the Tok Pisin ''braun'' for brown or the Tok Pisin ''vilivil'' for bicycle has replaced the former ''aingau''. It is considered a prestigious language and is the primary language of communication in the two major centers of East New Britain: [[Kokopo]] and [[Rabaul]].

Tolai lost the phoneme /s/. For instance, the word for 'sun' in closely related languages of South [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] is ''kesakese'', and this has been reduced to ''keake'' in Tolai. However, /s/ has been reintroduced through numerous loanwords from English and Tok Pisin.

==Classification==
Tolai belongs to the [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] branch of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] [[language family]]. The most immediate subgroup is the [[Patpatar–Tolai]] group of languages which also includes [[Lungalunga language|Lungalunga]] (also spoken on the Gazelle Peninsula) and [[Patpatar]] (spoken on [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]]).

==Geographic distribution==
Tolai is spoken on the Gazelle Peninsula in the East New Britain Province of Papua New Guinea.

===Derived languages===
Tolai is said to be one of the major [[substratum]] languages of Tok Pisin. Some common Tok Pisin vocabulary items that likely come from Tolai (or a closely related language) include:

''aibika'' (from ''ibika'') - [[Abelmoschus manihot|Hibiscus manihot]]&lt;br&gt;
''buai'' - [[betelnut]]&lt;br&gt;
''diwai'' (from ''dawai'') - tree, wood&lt;br&gt;
''guria'' - [[earthquake]]&lt;br&gt;
''kawawar'' (from ''kavavar'') - [[ginger]]&lt;br&gt;
''kiau'' - egg&lt;br&gt;
''lapun'' - elderly person&lt;br&gt;
''liklik'' (from ''ikilik'') - small&lt;br&gt;
''umben'' (from ''uben'') - [[fishing net]]

Vowel sounds can also be realised as [ɪ, ɛ, ʌ, ɔ, ʊ].

===Independent pronouns===

Tolai pronouns have four [[grammatical number|number]] distinctions (singular, dual, trial and plural) and three [[grammatical person|person]] distinctions (first person, second person and third person) as well as an [[inclusive and exclusive we|inclusive/exclusive]] distinction. There are no [[grammatical gender|gender distinctions]].

{| class="wikitable"

|- align="center"
! 1st exclusive
| ''iau''&lt;br&gt;(I) || ''(a)mir''&lt;br&gt;(he/she and I) || ''(a)mital''&lt;br&gt;(both of them, and I) || ''avet''&lt;br&gt;(all of them, and I)
|- align="center"

| ''ia''&lt;br&gt;(he/she) || ''dir''&lt;br&gt;(they two) || ''dital''&lt;br&gt;(they three) || diat&lt;br&gt;(they)
|}

The plural pronouns lose their final -t when used before a verb. ''''Da''' vana!' - 'Let's go!', 'Pa '''ave''' gire.' - 'We didn't see.', ''''Dia''' tar pot' - 'They have already arrived.'

===Syntax===
The usual word order of Tolai is [[Agent–verb–object|SVO]].

===Morphology===
There is an irregular pattern involving the prefix '''ni-''', which changes a verb to a noun. Ordinarily, the prefix is added to the verb, as in ''laun'' "to live" → ''a '''ni'''laun'' "the life", ''ian'' "to eat" → ''a '''ni'''an'' "the food", ''aring'' "to pray" → ''a '''ni'''aring'' "the prayer". However, in some cases it becomes an [[infix]] {{angbr|'''in'''}}: ''varubu'' "to fight" → ''a v'''in'''arubu'' "the fight", ''tata'' "to talk" → ''a t'''in'''ata'' "the language", ''mamai'' "to chew betelnut" → ''a m'''in'''amai'' "(a small supply of) betelnuts for chewing". This infix is inserted after the initial phoneme of the verb. It could also be described as the prefix '''ni-''' being added as a prefix, and the initial phoneme of the verb changing places with the ''n'' of the prefix.

'''Tomás Ó Caiside''', aka '''An Caisideach Bán''', c. 1709 – 1773?, was an Irish [[friar]], soldier, and poet.

==Biography==

Ó Caiside's family was of [[Ulster]] stock, his parents settling in Drishacaun townland, parish of Kilmurry, [[Castleplunkett]], [[County Roscommon]]. What is known of his life is told in ''Eachtra Thomáis Uí Chaiside'' ("The Adventures of Tomás Ó Caiside") which he wrote himself. Two surviving copies, one by his friend and contemporary [[Brian Ó Fearghail]], are kept in the [[Royal Irish Academy]] and the [[British Museum]].

He was dismissed from the friary of [[Ballyhaunis]] "on account of a bad senseless marriage" and spent the rest of his life travelling all over Ireland and Britain, as well as central Europe. In 1733 he served in the [[Duke of Berwick]]'s regiment and was later pressed into the [[Prussian army]], where he encountered the [[Potsdam Giants]], alongside fellow-Irishman [[James Kirkland (Irish giant)]].

He mentions having been in the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]]; the [[Black Forest]]; [[Sandhausen]]; [[Hanover]]; [[Prussia]]; [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]]; [[Bristol]]; and [[Bideford]].

His poems include:

* ''An Caisideach Bán''
* ''Béal Átha hAmhnais''
* ''Máire Bhéal Átha hAmhnais''
* ''Faoisdin Uí Chaiside'' (''Ó Caiside's Confession'')
* ''Bríd Ní Bheirn''
* ''An Bráithrín Buartha'' (''The Troubled Friar'')

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2687">A '''top drive''' is a mechanical device on a [[drilling rig]] that provides clockwise torque to the [[drill string]] to drill a [[borehole]]. It is an alternative to the [[rotary table (drilling rig)|rotary table]] and [[kelly drive]]. It is located at the [[swivel (drill rig)|swivel's]] place below the traveling block and moves vertically up and down the derrick.  

The top drive allows the drilling rig to drill the longer section of a stand of [[drill pipe]] in one operation.  A rotary table type rig can only drill {{convert|30|ft|adj=on}} (single drill pipe) sections of drill pipe whereas a top drive can drill {{convert|60|-|90|ft|adj=on}} stands (double and triple drill pipe respectively, a triple being three joints of drillpipe screwed together), depending on the drilling rig size.  Handling longer sections of drill pipe enables a drilling rig to make greater daily progress because up to {{convert|90|ft|adj=on}} can be drilled at a time, thus requiring fewer "connections" to add another {{convert|30|ft|adj=on}} of drill pipe. Another advantage of top drive systems is time efficiency.  When the bit progresses under a kelly drive, the entire string must be withdrawn from the well bore for the length of the [[Kelly drive|kelly]] in order to add one more length of drill pipe.  With a top drive, the [[Draw-works|draw works]] only has to pick up a new stand from the rack and make up two joints.  Making fewer and quicker connections reduces the risk of a stuck string from annulus clogging while [[drilling fluid]] is not being pumped.  

Several different kinds of top drives exist, and are usually classified based on the "Safe Working Load" (SWL) of the equipment and the size and type of motor used to rotate the drillpipe. For offshore and heavy duty use, a 1000 short ton unit would be used, whereas a smaller land rig may only require a 500 short ton device. Various sizes of hydraulic motors, or AC or DC electric motors, are available.

[[File:omega-exp-omega-labeled.svg|thumb|300px|Representation of the ordinal numbers up to &amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sup&gt;. Each turn of the spiral represents one power of &amp;omega;. Transfinite induction requires proving a '''base case''' (used for 0), a '''successor case''' (used for those ordinals which have a predecessor), and a '''limit case''' (used for ordinals which don't have a predecessor).]]

'''Transfinite induction''' is an extension of [[mathematical induction]] to [[well-order|well-ordered sets]], for example to sets of [[ordinal number]]s or [[cardinal number]]s.

Let P(α) be a [[Property (philosophy)#Properties in mathematics|property]] defined for all ordinals α. Suppose that whenever P(β) is true for all  β &lt; α, then P(α) is also true.  Then transfinite induction tells us that P is true for all ordinals.

Usually the proof is broken down into three cases:

* '''Zero case:''' Prove that P(0) is true.
* '''Successor case:''' Prove that for any [[successor ordinal]] α+1, P(α+1) follows from P(α) (and, if necessary, P(β) for all β &lt; α).
* '''Limit case:''' Prove that for any [[limit ordinal]] λ, P(λ) follows from [P(β) for all β &lt; λ].

All three cases are identical except for the type of ordinal considered.  They do not formally need to be considered separately, but in practice the proofs are typically so different as to require separate presentations. Zero is sometimes considered a [[limit ordinal]] and then may sometimes be treated in proofs in the same case as limit ordinals.

==Transfinite recursion==
'''Transfinite recursion''' is similar to transfinite induction; however, instead of proving that something holds for all ordinal numbers, we construct a sequence of objects, one for each ordinal.

As an example, a basis for a (possibly infinite-dimensional) vector space can be created by choosing a vector &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; and for each ordinal α choosing a vector that is not in the span of the vectors &lt;math&gt;\{v_{\beta}|\beta&lt;\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt;. This process stops when no vector can be chosen.

More formally, we can state the Transfinite Recursion Theorem as follows:

* '''Transfinite Recursion Theorem (version 1)'''. Given a class function&lt;ref&gt;A class function is a rule (specifically, a logical formula) assigning each element in the lefthand class to an element in the righthand class. It is not a [[function (mathematics)|function]] because its domain and codomain are not sets.&lt;/ref&gt; ''G'': ''V'' → ''V'' (where ''V'' is the [[Class (set theory)|class]] of all sets), there exists a unique [[transfinite sequence]] ''F'': Ord → ''V'' (where Ord is the class of all ordinals) such that
:''F''(α) = ''G''(''F'' &lt;math&gt;\upharpoonright&lt;/math&gt; α) for all ordinals α, where &lt;math&gt;\upharpoonright&lt;/math&gt; denotes the restriction of ''F'''s domain to ordinals &lt; α.

As in the case of induction, we may treat different types of ordinals separately: another formulation of transfinite recursion is the following:

* '''Transfinite Recursion Theorem (version 2)'''. Given a set ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and class functions ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''G''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, there exists a unique function ''F'': Ord → ''V'' such that
* ''F''(0) = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,
* ''F''(α + 1) = ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''F''(α)), for all α ∈ Ord,
* ''F''(λ) = ''G''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'' &lt;math&gt;\upharpoonright&lt;/math&gt; λ), for all limit λ ≠ 0.

Note that we require the domains of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''G''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to be broad enough to make the above properties meaningful.  The uniqueness of the sequence satisfying these properties can be proved using transfinite induction.

More generally, one can define objects by transfinite recursion on any [[well-founded relation]] ''R''. (''R'' need not even be a set; it can be a [[proper class]], provided it is a [[binary relation#Relations over a set|set-like]] relation; that is, for any ''x'', the collection of all ''y'' such that ''y R x'' must be a set.)

==Relationship to the axiom of choice==
Proofs or constructions using induction and recursion often use the [[axiom of choice]] to produce a well-ordered relation that can be treated by transfinite induction. However, if the relation in question is already well-ordered, one can often use transfinite induction without invoking the axiom of choice.&lt;ref&gt;In fact, the domain of the relation does not even need to be a set. It can be a proper class, provided that the relation ''R'' is set-like: for any ''x'', the collection of all ''y'' such that ''y''&amp;nbsp;''R''&amp;nbsp;''x'' must be a set.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many results about [[Borel sets]] are proved by transfinite induction on the ordinal rank of the set; these ranks are already well-ordered, so the axiom of choice is not needed to well-order them.

The following construction of the [[Vitali set]] shows one way that the axiom of choice can be used in a proof by transfinite induction:
: First, [[well-order]] the [[real number]]s (this is where the axiom of choice enters via the [[well-ordering theorem]]), giving a sequence &lt;math&gt; \langle r_{\alpha} | \alpha &lt; \beta \rangle &lt;/math&gt;, where &amp;beta; is an ordinal with the [[cardinality of the continuum]].  Let ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; equal ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  Then let ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; equal ''r''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, where α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is least such that ''r''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is not a [[rational number]].  Continue; at each step use the least real from the ''r'' sequence that does not have a rational difference with any element thus far constructed in the ''v'' sequence.  Continue until all the reals in the ''r'' sequence are exhausted.  The final ''v'' sequence will enumerate the Vitali set.
The above argument uses the axiom of choice in an essential way at the very beginning, in order to well-order the reals. After that step, the axiom of choice is not used again.

Other uses of the axiom of choice are more subtle. For example, a construction by transfinite recursion frequently will not specify a ''unique'' value for ''A''&lt;sub&gt;α+1&lt;/sub&gt;, given the sequence up to α, but will specify only a ''condition'' that ''A''&lt;sub&gt;α+1&lt;/sub&gt; must satisfy, and argue that there is at least one set satisfying this condition. If it is not possible to define a unique example of such a set at each stage, then it may be necessary to invoke (some form of) the axiom of choice to select one such at each step.  For inductions and recursions of [[countable set|countable]] length, the weaker [[axiom of dependent choice]] is sufficient. Because there are models of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] of interest to set theorists that satisfy the axiom of dependent choice but not the full axiom of choice, the knowledge that a particular proof only requires dependent choice can be useful.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2670">OneSource is an evolving data analysis tool used internally by the [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC) Vocabulary Services Team, and made available to general data management community.  It is used by the greater [[US Department of Defense]] (DoD) and [[NATO]] community for [[controlled vocabulary]] management and exploration. It provides its users with a consistent view of [[syntactical]], [[lexicon|lexical]], and [[semantic]] data vocabularies through a community-driven web environment.  It was created with the intention of directly supporting the DoD [[Net-centric]] Data Strategy of visible, understandable, and accessible data assets.

OneSource serves developers, integrators, managers, and [[community of interest]] (COI) participants as a focus point for searching, navigating, annotating, [[semantic matching]], and mapping data terms extracted from military standards, COI vocabularies, programs of record, and other schemas and data sources.

OneSource is based upon a [[United States Air Force]] researched and developed [[triplestore]] [[knowledge base]] architecture, which allows [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]], [[Web Ontology Language]], [[relational database]], [[spreadsheet]], and even custom data models to be handled and presented in the same manner.  Initial capability was released in 2006.  Version 2 was released in 2008 with the previously disjoint matching and mapping capabilities fully integrated for use in a web browser.

'''''Writing and Difference''''' ({{lang-fr|L'écriture et la différence}}) is a book by French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]], collecting some of the early lectures and essays that established his international fame. It was published in 1967 alongside ''[[Of Grammatology]]'' and ''[[Speech and Phenomena]]''.

==Summary==

===Cogito and the History of Madness===
{{Main article|Cogito and the History of Madness}}

The collection contains the essay ''Cogito and the History of Madness'', a critique of [[Michel Foucault]]. It was first given as a lecture on March 4, 1963, at a conference at the ''[[Collège philosophique]]'', which Foucault attended, and caused a rift between the two,&lt;ref name="Powell06p34-5"&gt;Powell (2006), pp. 34–5{{full citation needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly prompting Foucault to write ''[[The Order of Things]]'' (1966) and ''[[The Archaeology of Knowledge]]'' (1969).&lt;ref name="GinzburgNihilism"&gt;Carlo Ginzburg (1976), ''Il formaggio e i vermi'', translated in 1980 as ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4IUREWq_o3MC The Cheese and the Worms: The Cosmos of a Sixteenth-Century Miller]'', trans. Anne Tedeschi (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press), xviii. {{ISBN|978-0-8018-4387-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence and Metaphysics===
In "Violence and Metaphysics," Derrida comments on the writings of [[Emmanuel Levinas]]. He honors Levinas for his ethical philosophy of openness to the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]]. Indeed, he goes along with the idea that to live for the Other is the highest good. But he challenges the idea that only [[face-to-face interaction]] can be ethical. Whereas Levinas sees written communication as dead and unresponsive, Derrida argues that writing can be just as valuable a space for ethical encounter. He writes, in characteristic support for writing: "Is it not possible to invert all of Levinas’s statements on this point? By showing, for example, that writing can assist itself, for it has time and freedom, escaping better than speech from empirical urgencies."&lt;ref&gt;''Writing and Difference'', 102&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Structuralist Controversy===
Included in the collection is his 1966 lecture at [[Johns Hopkins University]], which changed the course of the conference leading it to be renamed ''The Structuralist Controversy'', and caused Derrida to receive his first major attention outside France. The lecture is titled ''[[Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences]]''.
