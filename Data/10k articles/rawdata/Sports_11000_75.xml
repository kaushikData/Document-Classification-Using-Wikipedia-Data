[[File:Big_Sam_Allardyce_signs_autographs_for_fans_October_2014.jpg|thumb|[[Sam Allardyce]] resigned as [[England national football team manager]] following the scandal]]
The '''2016 English football scandal''' is a [[sport]]s [[corruption]] scandal which began on 26 September 2016 following the publishing of the first part of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper's '''"Football for Sale"''' investigation into corruption in English football.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/26/exclusive-how-sam-allardyce-tried-to-make-as-much-money-as-possi/|title=Exclusive: How Sam Allardyce tried to make as much money as possible as England manager - before his first match|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal resulted in the resignation of [[England national football team]] manager [[Sam Allardyce]] after only one game in charge, as well as the sacking or suspension of numerous [[English Football League]] club staff, including [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] assistant manager [[Tommy Wright (footballer, born 1966)|Tommy Wright]].&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/09/29/corruption-at-the-top-of-the-championship-live-reaction-to-the-r/|title=Tommy Wright sacked by Barnsley for accepting £5k cash 'bung' following Telegraph investigation|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline of events==

===26 September===
On 26 September, ''The Daily Telegraph'' published footage filmed by undercover reporters in which then England manager Sam Allardyce is shown speaking with fictitious Asian businessmen, detailing how to get around [[FIFA]] and [[Football Association]] bans on [[Third-party ownership in association football|third-party ownership of football players]],&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; before making derogatory comments about former England assistant manager [[Gary Neville]] and previous England manager [[Roy Hodgson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/26/exclusive-sam-allardyce-mocked-predecessor-roy-hodgson---and-hit/|title=Exclusive: Sam Allardyce mocked predecessor Roy Hodgson - and hit out at Gary Neville|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allardyce subsequently spoke about [[HM Revenue and Customs]], calling them the "most corrupt business in the world", Allardyce himself having been caught up in alleged tax fraud schemes in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/27/exclusive-sam-allardyce-claimed-hmrc-is-the-most-corrupt-busines/|title=Exclusive: Sam Allardyce claimed HMRC is the 'most corrupt business' in Britain|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===27 September===
Following the revelations by ''The Daily Telegraph'', the FA and Allardyce agreed on 27 September for him to resign as England manager with immediate effect by mutual consent, with [[Gareth Southgate]] being named as caretaker manager. Following Allardyce's departure, ''The Daily Telegraph'' published further details of much wider-reaching corruption through English club football, claiming that eight [[Premier League]] managers accepted "bungs" for player transfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/27/exclusive-eight-premier-league-managers-took-transfer-bungs-clai/|title=Exclusive: Eight Premier League managers accused of taking transfer bungs|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 September, ''The Daily Telegraph'' revealed that the [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] assistant manager [[Tommy Wright (footballer, born 1966)|Tommy Wright]] had taken a £5000 "bung" in order to arrange for the club to purchase part-owned players from a fictitious Far East firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/28/how-barnsley-assistant-manager-tommy-wright-took-5k-bung-to-help/|title=How Barnsley assistant manager Tommy Wright took £5k bung to help agents place players at his club - then took part in bizarre meeting|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was initially suspended by Barnsley as they launched an investigation into the allegations; he was sacked on 28 September.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk1"/&gt;

===28 September===
On 28 September, it was claimed by ''The Daily Telegraph'' that [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] manager [[Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink]] had agreed to become an ambassador for a fictitious Far East sports company involved in third-party ownership of players in exchange for £55,000, subsequently also discussing potential tax avoidance involving his bank account in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/28/qpr-manager-jimmy-floyd-hasselbaink-asked-for-55k-to-act-for-spo/|title=QPR manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink asked for £55k to act for sports company that proposed selling players to his club|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hasselbaink denied the claim, although he admitted he had been naive, and was supported by Queens Park Rangers after their internal investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37654637|title=Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink: QPR back manager over Daily Telegraph claims|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] chairman [[Massimo Cellino]] was shown on video agreeing to sell 20% of the club in order to work around third-party player ownership rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/28/leeds-united-owner-massimo-cellino-suggested-ways-of-getting-round-player-purchase-rules/|title=Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino offers to sell 20 per cent of club to help 'businessmen' get round third party rules|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===29 September===
On 29 September, ''The Daily Telegraph'' released further footage from their investigation, alleging to show the assistant manager of [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], [[Eric Black]], advising fictitious businessmen on how to bribe lower league clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/29/how-southamptons-eric-black-advised-businessmen-how-to-bribe-low/|title=How Southampton’s Eric Black advised ‘businessmen’ how to bribe lower league staff to get players for fictitious agency|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Jimmy Houtput, chairman of [[Belgian First Division B]] club [[Oud-Heverlee Leuven]], allegedly offered his club as a "conduit" in order to aid third-party companies in gaining ownership of football players in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/29/belgium-football-club-offered-itself-as-a-conduit-to-help-a-fict/|title=Belgium football club offered itself as a conduit to help a fictitious investment firm get around third party ownership - against FA and Fifa rules|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houtput resigned as OH Leuven chairman the following day.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/30/belgian-football-club-chairman-resigns-after-offering-club-as-co/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
[[Wales national football team|Wales]] manager [[Chris Coleman (footballer)|Chris Coleman]] commented that corruption in the football industry should be punished by lifetime bans for the perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/29/chris-coleman-condemns-unforgivable-industry-of-football-corrupt/|title=Chris Coleman: We belong to an industry where there is corruption - ban corrupt managers for life|author=Tom Morgan and Christopher Hope|website=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former player and pundit [[Alan Shearer]] was particularly critical, claiming he "didn't think England could stoop any lower" following the [[UEFA Euro 2016 knockout phase#England v Iceland|England team's 1–2 loss to Iceland]] during [[UEFA Euro 2016]] three months earlier, and called the team "a laughing stock of world football".&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37490396Z|title=Sam Allardyce: England a laughing stock - Alan Shearer|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ACOLOP''' ([[acronym]] for {{lang|pt|'''Associação dos Comités Olímpicos de Língua Oficial Portuguesa'''}}; {{lang-en|Association of the Portuguese Speaking Olympic Committees}}), is an [[Olympic Movement|Olympic]]-related [[non-profit organisation]] officially established on June 8, 2004, in [[Lisbon]]. It was founded by the [[National Olympic Committee|national Olympic committees]] (NOCs) of [[Angola]], [[Brazil]], [[Cape Verde]], [[East Timor]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Macau]] ([[People's Republic of China|Chinese SAR]]), [[Mozambique]], [[Portugal]] and [[São Tomé and Príncipe]]; it also includes [[Equatorial Guinea]] as an associate member. On April 2006, [[India]] (represented by the [[Goa]] Olympic Association) and [[Sri Lanka]] were admitted also as associate members, based on their common historical past with Portugal.

The [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]-speaking countries are spread through four continents and reach a total population of about 250 million people. Portuguese thus occupies a place among the most spoken languages in the world. The purpose of reinforcing the bonds between these nations and promoting unity and cooperation through sport was the main reason for ACOLOP's creation.

==Goals and projects==
The goals which guide this organisation are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comiteolimpicoportugal.pt/conteudo-detalhe.php?id=148 |title=Associação dos Comités Olímpicos de Língua Official Portuguesa (ACOLOP) |publisher=[[Olympic Committee of Portugal|Comité Olímpico de Portugal]] |accessdate=2006-10-15 |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619120100/http://comiteolimpicoportugal.pt/conteudo-detalhe.php?id=148 |archivedate=2006-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The spreading of the [[Olympic Charter|Olympic ideals]] on every member country and territory;
* Equality, mutual respect and interest convergence-based cooperation between every member country and territory;
* Cooperation of every member country and territory on the definition of objectives, data exchange and common interests defense;
* Development of Olympic solidarity programs with the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) support;
* Cooperation on an [[Olympic Games]] mission-chief level;
* Joint-bids for places on the International Olympic Movement structure;
* Staging of the ACOLOP Games ([[Lusophony Games]]).

At the 8th general assembly, in Macau (February 2, 2007), the president Manuel Silvério stated the intention of campaigning for the elevation of Portuguese language to official status inside the IOC and [[Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa]] (ANOCA) structures. On the agenda is also the creation of a "Lusophone Olympic Academy", institution of an "International Lusophony Day", promotion of an annual [[football (soccer)|football]] tournament and also an annual sporting awards gala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.comiteolimpicoportugal.pt/detalhe-noticia.php?id_new=514 |title=8.ª Assembleia-Geral da ACOLOP debate futuro |date=2007-02-02 |accessdate=2007-02-09 |publisher=Comité Olímpico de Portugal |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927034433/http://www.comiteolimpicoportugal.pt/detalhe-noticia.php?id_new=514 |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 8, 2007, precisely three years after the creation of the ACOLOP, the organization's new official portal was launched. Its servers are located on the organization's headquarters in Macau. This portal was established with the purpose of strengthening the communication between the Lusophone world and the ACOLOP. It serves also as a platform to display all news and activities concerning all member associations, especially those that do not have a portal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acolop.info/noticia.php?id=28 |title=Site assinala três anos de vida: ACOLOP global |publisher=ACOLOP |date=2007-06-08 |accessdate=2007-06-08 |language=Portuguese, English |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929165244/http://www.acolop.info/noticia.php?id=28 |archivedate=2007-09-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohammad Daoud Oudeh''' ({{lang-ar|محمد داود عودة}}), commonly known by his [[nom de guerre]] '''Abu Daoud''' or '''Abu Dawud''' ({{lang-ar|أبو داود}}) 1937,  – 3 July 2010)&lt;ref&gt;Bard, Mitchell. [http://www.france24.com/en/20100703-mastermind-behind-munich-olympics-attacks-dies-abu-daoud-palestine-israel "Mastermind behind the Munich Olympics attacks dies".] France24. 3 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] known as the planner, architect and mastermind of the [[Munich massacre]]. He served in a number of commanding functions in [[Fatah]]'s armed units in [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]].

==Biography==
Oudeh was born in Silwan, East Jerusalem, in 1937.&lt;ref name=tnational/&gt;&lt;ref name=jessup&gt;{{cite book|last=Jessup|first=John E.|title=An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Conflict and Conflict Resolution, 1945-1996|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|page=150|url=https://www.questia.com/read/106899354/an-encyclopedic-dictionary-of-conflict-and-conflict}} {{Subscription required|via=Questia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a teacher by training.&lt;ref name=jessup/&gt; He taught physics and maths in [[Jordan]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name=jessup/&gt; Then he worked at the justice ministry of [[Kuwait]]&lt;ref name=jessup/&gt; and studied law.&lt;ref name=tnational/&gt; He lived in [[Jerusalem]] until the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], when he was displaced as [[Israel]] recaptured the eastern portion of the city; he resettled in Jordan, where he joined the PLO. In 1970, Abu Daoud was one of the founders of Fatah. From 1971, he was leader of the [[Black September (group)|Black September]], a Fatah offshoot created to avenge the [[Black September (Jordan)|September 1970 expulsion]] of the [[Fedayeen]] Movement from [[Jordan]] and carry out international operations. The group gained international notoriety for its role in the Munich massacre at the [[1972 Munich Olympics]], in which a number of athletes on the Israeli team were taken hostage by Black September.  Eleven Israeli athletes and a German policeman were killed by the end of the multi-day standoff.

After the Black September operations, Oudeh  began to live in Eastern Europe and Lebanon.&lt;ref name=trevor&gt;{{cite news|last=Mostyn|first=Trevor|title=Mohammed Oudeh (Abu Daoud) obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/04/mohammed-oudeh-abu-daoud-obituary|accessdate=16 December 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resumed his activity in Fatah and the PLO in close collaboration with [[Abu Iyad]] and other officials. He led armed units in [[Lebanon]] during the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. In January 1977, Oudeh was intercepted by French police in [[Paris]] while travelling from [[Beirut]] under an assumed name.&lt;ref name="'70s 319"&gt;{{cite book|title=How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first=David|authorlink=David Frum|year= 2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0-465-04195-7|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under protest from the PLO, [[Iraq]], and [[Libya]], who claimed that because Oudeh  was traveling to a PLO comrade's funeral he should receive [[diplomatic immunity]], the French government refused a [[West German]] [[extradition]] request on grounds that forms had not been filled in properly and put him on a plane to [[Algeria]] before [[Germany]] could submit another request.&lt;ref name="'70s 319"/&gt; Oudeh fled to [[Eastern Europe]], then to Lebanon until the 1975 [[Lebanese Civil War]] broke out, then back to Jordan.

On 1 August 1981,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vn4xAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=z6QFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1201,2333085&amp;dq=daoud&amp;hl=en "Suspected Olympic massacre mastermind shot"], ''Montreal Gazette'', 6 August 1981, p10&lt;/ref&gt; Oudeh was shot five times from a distance of around two meters in the coffee shop of the Victoria Inter-Continental Hotel in [[Warsaw]], but he survived the attack, chasing his would-be assassin down to the front entrance before collapsing. Oudeh claimed the attempted assassination was carried out by a Palestinian double agent recruited by the [[Mossad]], and claimed the would-be assassin was executed by the PLO ten years later.

After the 1993 [[Oslo Accords]], he moved to [[Ramallah]] in the [[West Bank]]. Following a trip to Jordan and the publication of his memoirs, Oudeh was banned from returning to Ramallah. He settled with his family in [[Syria]], the only country that would take him. He lived on a pension provided by the [[Palestinian Authority]] and  gave interviews to [[Aljazeera]] and other Arab and international media outlets about his life, the Munich events, and Palestinian politics. Oudeh was allowed safe passage through Israel in 1996, so he could attend a PLO meeting in the [[Gaza Strip]] to rescind an article in the PLO charter calling for Israel's eradication.

==Munich massacre==
As a commander of Black September, Abu Daoud was the mastermind behind the Munich massacre. He planned the operation in July 1972, briefed the execution cell on the specifics of the operation, and accompanied the members of the execution cell to the Olympic Village by taxi on the night/early morning of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, Guri.  [http://www.jewishjournal.com/opinion/article/nazis_at_the_olympic_village_gate "Nazis at the Olympic Village Gate."] ''Jewish Journal''.  4 August 2016.  4 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It was on the evening of 4 September 1972, the day before the operation commenced in the early morning of 5 September 1972, that Abu Daoud briefed the assassination squad and issued final instructions over dinner in a restaurant at the Munich railway station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Abu Daoud|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=4 July 2010|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/sport-obituaries/7871498/Abu-Daoud.html|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in 2006, Abu Daoud gave several personal interviews after the release of the Steven Spielberg film ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'' revived discussions of the massacre. Abu Daoud remained unrepentant regarding his role in the Munich attacks, stating on Germany's ''Spiegel TV'', "I regret nothing. You can only dream that I would apologize."&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt; In an Associated Press interview, he justified the operation by claiming it was a strategic success, declaring, "Before Munich, we were simply terrorists. After Munich, at least people started asking who are these terrorists? What do they want? Before Munich, nobody had the slightest idea about Palestine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Munich mastermind has no regrets|author=Zeina Karam|newspaper=Seattle Post Intelligencer|agency=Associated Press|date=24 February 2006|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/olympics/260723_mastermind24.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published works==
He published his autobiography ''Palestine: From Jerusalem to Munich'' in French in 1999. It was later published in English as ''Memoirs of a Palestinian Terrorist'', also titled ''Palestine-A History of the Resistance Movement, by the Sole Survivor of Black September'' by Arcade Publishing in hardcover format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Memoirs-Palestinian-Terrorist-Abu-Daoud/dp/1559704292|title=Memoirs of a Palestinian Terrorist'|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English version is now out of print. The book is a first hand account of the rise of the Palestinian resistance movement from its inception to the attack at the 1972 Munich Olympics. Regarding the book and his subsequently being barred from returning to the West Bank, "The Israeli decision to bar my return is linked to an event which happened 27 years ago, the Munich operation, which we considered a legitimate struggle against the enemy we (the PLO) were fighting."&lt;ref name="reuters1"&gt;Makdesi, Marwan, Dominic Evans and Jon Hemming. [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6622GL20100703 "Palestinian who planned Munich attack dies in Syria".] [[Reuters]]. 3 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the Palestinian Prize for Culture was granted to Abu Daoud for his book ''Palestine: From Jerusalem to Munich'', in which he describes how he planned and executed the Munich operation. As part of the prize, Abu Daoud was awarded 10,000 French francs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mastermind of Munich Massacre to Receive the Palestine Prize |author=Fayez Abbas |newspaper=Yedioth Ahronoth |date=14 November 1999 |url=http://www.gamla.org.il/english/article/1999/nov/ler1.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715084357/http://www.gamla.org.il/english/article/1999/nov/ler1.htm |archivedate=15 July 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Peace Can't Work |author=Arnold Beichman |work=National Review |date=5 May 2003 |url=http://article.nationalreview.com/268735/why-peace-cant-work/arnold-beichman |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707185549/http://article.nationalreview.com/268735/why-peace-cant-work/arnold-beichman |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 3 July 2010, Daoud died of [[Renal failure|kidney failure]] at [[Al-Andalus]] Hospital&lt;ref name="reuters1"/&gt; in [[Damascus]], Syria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/international/planner-of-deadly-munich-olympics-attack-dies-in-syria-1.299788 "Planner of deadly Munich Olympics attack dies in Syria".] ''Haaretz Daily Newspaper''. 3 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; After a funeral service in the Al Wasim Mosque in Yarmouk with his coffin draped in the [[Palestinian flag]], he was buried in the Martyrs Cemetery of the [[Yarmouk (camp)|Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp]] on the southern outskirts of Damascus. He was survived by his wife, five daughters and a son.&lt;ref name=trevor/&gt; His daughter Hana Oudeh, in the eulogy, said her father was "a great loving and sincere man whose dream was to go back to Palestine." Representatives of various Palestinian groups, including Fatah and [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]], attended the funeral. Shortly before his death, Oudeh said in a statement to Israelis, "Today, I cannot fight you anymore, but my grandson will and his grandsons too."&lt;ref name=tnational&gt;{{cite news|title=Mohammed Daoud Oudeh, mastermind of Munich kidnappings|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/mohammed-daoud-oudeh-mastermind-of-munich-kidnappings|accessdate=16 December 2012|newspaper=The National|date=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a condolence letter to Abu Daoud's family following his death, [[President of the Palestinian National Authority|Chairman]] of the [[Palestinian Authority]] [[Mahmoud Abbas]] wrote, "He is missed. He was one of the leading figures of Fatah and spent his life in resistance and sincere work as well as physical sacrifice for his people's just causes."&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news|title=Suspected Munich massacre mastermind dead, reports say|work=CNN|date=3 July 2010|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/07/03/munich.mastermind.dead/index.html?fbid=UmPw3wDi82F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi=157&amp;doc_id=2531|title=Abbas on mastermind of Munich Olympics massacre: "A wonderful brother, companion, tough and stubborn, relentless fighter"|author=Itamar Marcus and Nan Jacques Zilberdik|date=6 July 2010|publisher=Palestinian Media Watch|accessdate=6 July 2010|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100711142628/http://palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi=157&amp;doc_id=2531|archivedate=11 July 2010&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}{{Arnold Schwarzenegger series}}The '''Arnold Strongman Classic''' is an annual competition featuring [[strength athletes]] from all over the world. Created by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[Jim Lorimer (fitness trainer)|Jim Lorimer]], it is an offshoot of the [[Arnold Sports Festival]] which takes place annually in [[Columbus, Ohio]], [[United States|USA]]. Instead of focusing on endurance, speed and athleticism like the [[World's Strongest Man]], the competition is geared toward the heaviest instruments in the world to find out who truly is the strongest man.

== History ==
The Arnold Strongman (which has been variously referred to as the "Arnold Classic", the "Arnold Classic Strongman", "Arnold's Summit" and "Arnold's Strongest Man") is one of the many offshoots of the Arnold festival. The Arnold Sports Festival, founded in 1989  as the [[Arnold Classic]] and named after [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], was originally a bodybuilding contest.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} It featured a competition for men (Arnold Classic) and for women ([[Ms. International]]). The bodybuilding contests have since expanded to include a [[Fitness International]] and [[Figure International]] competition for women. However, the event had also expanded to include other sports and events, one of which was a strongman, introduced in late 2002. This Strongman event was created by a powerlifter named [[Dr. Terry Todd]] at the request of Arnold Schwarzenegger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/features/2005/powerlifting/index.html Feature Story: Body of Work: Two record-setting powerlifters pump up world's largest physical culture collection&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620060833/http://www.utexas.edu/features/2005/powerlifting/index.html |date=2013-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of the programme led to the Classic becoming the Arnold Fitness Weekend and now the [[Arnold Sports Festival]]. According to the [[Arnold Sports Festival]] co-producer, Jim Lorimer: ''"The Arnold Strongman Classic has been growing in popularity every year, and we are very excited that many strong men are returning."''&lt;ref name="AS"/&gt;  January 29, 2008

In 2002 the American professional wrestler and former weight lifter [[Mark Henry]] won the competition.&lt;ref name="SLAM!"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/henry_mark.html|title=Mark Henry|last=Milner|first=John M.|author2=Oliver, Greg|accessdate=March 20, 2009|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|work=Slam! Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to competing in what were the four official events — the Apollon's Wheel, the deadlift, the Hummer push and the 800+lbs Farmer's Walk — the competitors were given the opportunity to attempt to lift the [[Thomas Inch]] "unliftable" dumbbell, or ''Inch Bell''. A prize of $1000 was awarded to the man who could pull it the highest in the air. Five men chose to try the Bell&lt;ref&gt;Bergmanis, Philippi, Pfister, Schoonveld, and Henry&lt;/ref&gt; with Mark Henry winning the $1000 by pulling it to the level of his chest.  Pfister raised the Inch Bell over his head with his right hand, to a standing ovation, but his lift was disqualified because he briefly stabilised the dumbbell with his left hand when it was on his knee and because he used a "continental clean" when raising the dumbbell to his chest.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gripboard.com/index.php?/topic/1455-apolloninch/&lt;/ref&gt;  Pfister was however also awarded $1000.

From 2003 to 2008 the Arnold Strongman was won every year by [[Žydrūnas Savickas]] of [[Lithuania]] (see [[#Full results|Full results]] below). In 2008 he received a $40,000 check from Gerard Dente of MHP, an [[Audemars Piguet]] watch by [[Robert Ronan]] and the Louis Cyr trophy (after the legendary strongman, [[Louis Cyr]]) and congratulations from Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. In the competition 12 world records were set with Savickas setting three of them. In the Tire Deadlift he lifted 1,027&amp;nbsp;lbs. In the Circus Dumbbell he tied with [[Derek Poundstone]] for the world record with nine lifts each, and in the Manhood Stones he lifted 525&amp;nbsp;lbs, three times.&lt;ref name="AS"/&gt;

American [[Derek Poundstone]] won in 2009 &amp; 2010. Derek took the vacant throne from Zydrunas when he took 2009 off from the competition. When Savickas returned in 2010, Derek retained his title by defeating Zydrunas.&lt;ref name="AS"/&gt;

Just days before the 2011 contest, 2 time defending champion Derek Poundstone was forced to withdraw from the contest due to injury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rxmuscle.com/strongman/strongman-articles/2630-derek-poundstone-withdraws-from-the-arnold-strongman-classic.html Derek Poundstone Withdraws from the Arnold Strongman Classic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Shaw came in and won the contest, and [[Mike Jenkins (strongman)|Mike Jenkins]], the winner of the 2010 Arnold Strongman amateur event who was competing in his first ever professional strongman competition, shocked many and finished in second place ahead of 6 time champion Zydrunas Savickas who came in third.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.rxmuscle.com/strongman/strongman-articles/2647-brian-shaw-of-colorado-wins-the-tenth-arnold-strongman-classic.html Brian Shaw of Colorado Wins the Tenth Arnold Strongman Classic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the inaugural ''"Arnold Strongman Classic-Europe"'' contest was formed, and is a joint promotion between Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jim Lorimer (Arnold Sports Festival co-promoter), Dr. Rafael Santonja (president of the International Federation of Body Building, "IFBB") as well as [[Strength athletics in the United States|American Strongman Corporation]] and [[Strongman Champions League]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.ironmind.com/ironmind/opencms/Articles/2012/Sep/Strongman_Champions_League_Coming_to_the_Arnold_Classic-Europe.html Strongman Champions League Coming to the Arnold Classic–Europe&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''"Arnold Strongman Classic-Europe"'' contest will differ significantly from the format of the original Arnold Strongman Classic event, with less of an emphasis on brute strength and heavy events, and will include a wider variety of events and some speed/loading events similar to [[Strongman Champions League]] and [[World's Strongest Man]] contests.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The format change is due largely in part to the event being broadcast and televised in 85 countries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6220">The '''British Basketball League Most Valuable Player award''' is an annual award of the United Kingdom's top professional [[basketball]] league, the [[British Basketball League]]. It is awarded to the league's top performing player throughout the duration of the season. The award is decided by a panel consisting of each of the League’s team's head coaches who submit one vote each at the end of the regular season, and the player with the most votes is presented with the award. Only on one occasion - the [[2006–07 British Basketball League season|2006–2007 season]] - has the award been shared between two players ([[Jeff Bonds]] and [[Brian Dux]]) due to a tie in the voting. Four players - [[Alton Byrd]], [[Tony Dorsey]], [[Trey Moore]] and [[Andrew Sullivan (basketball)|Andrew Sullivan]] - have won the award twice, whilst only two [[United Kingdom|British]]-born players have won the award, namely [[Roger Huggins]] and 43-time winner Lekan Popoola.

'''Camel racing''' is a popular sport in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, Jordan, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman,  Australia, and Mongolia. Professional camel racing, like [[horse racing]], is an event for [[betting]] and tourist attraction. [[Camel]]s can run at speeds up to 65&amp;nbsp;km/h (18&amp;nbsp;m/s; 40&amp;nbsp;mph) in short sprints and they can maintain a speed of 40&amp;nbsp;km/h (11&amp;nbsp;m/s; 25&amp;nbsp;mph) for an hour.
Camels are often controlled by child jockeys, but allegations of human rights abuses have led to nationwide bans on underage labor in the [[UAE]] and [[Qatar]]. In modern camel racing, camels are often controlled by [[Robot jockey|remote controlled robotic whips]].

A major camel race is the [[Camel Cup]] held at [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory|Alice Springs]] which is the second biggest prize purse camel race in Australia. It is held annually and includes not only the camel races themselves, but also a collection of market stalls and other entertainment.

The biggest [[prize money]] camel race in Australia is "The Boulia desert Sands" with a A$25,000 prize purse in Queensland.

==Child jockeys==
Children are often favored as jockeys because of their light weight. It has been reported that thousands of children (some reported as young as 2 years old) are [[human trafficking|trafficked]] from countries such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Pakistan,India and Sudan for use as jockeys for camel racing industry in [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2005/46606.htm 2005 U.S. State Department Trafficking in Persons Report]. State.gov. Retrieved 2011-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates range of 5,000 – 40,000 child camel jockeys in the Persian Gulf region.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Williamson, Lucy. (2005-02-04) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4236123.stm South Asia | Child camel jockeys find hope]. BBC News. Retrieved 2011-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article438324.ece The Times | UK News, World News and Opinion]. Timesonline.co.uk. Retrieved 2011-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many child camel jockeys are seriously injured by falling off the camels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4063391.stm Middle East | Help for Gulf child camel jockeys]. BBC News (2004-12-02). Retrieved 2011-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The child jockeys live in camps (called "ousbah") near the racetracks and many are victims of abuse.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Hundreds of children have been rescued from camel farms in Oman, Qatar, and [[UAE]] and taken back to their original homes or kept in shelter homes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/general/under-age-camel-jockeys-get-caring-hand-1.106700 Under-age camel jockeys get caring hand]. gulfnews. Retrieved 2011-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Many however, are unable to identify their parents or home communities in South Asia or Sudan. Some countries have issued penalties for those who trafficked child camel jockeys and ordered the owners responsibilities for returning the children back to their home countries. However, they report that in many instances the children rescued were those who had been sold away by their own parents in exchange for money or a job abroad. If they were returned, the children would again be sold for the same purposes. Other children did not speak their native languages, or did not know how to live outside the camel farms.

A prominent activist for rehabilitation and recovery of the jockeys is Pakistani lawyer [[Ansar Burney]]. He has focused a portion of his work on eliminating the use of child jockeys.

===Banning===
The United Arab Emirates was the first to ban the use of children under 15 as jockeys in camel racing when [[Sheikh]] [[Hamdan bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan|Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan]] announced the ban on 29 July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data/theuae/2005/May/theuae_May691.xml&amp;section=theuae UAE enforces stringent steps to eradicate child jockeys] (Wam), ''[[Khaleej Times]]'', 24 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the UAE paid compensation to 879 former jockeys.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Dean.

Retrieved 2012-01-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  The UAE now issues penalties such as jail and banning for those found using children as jockeys.  In 2010, volunteers from Anti-Slavery International photographed violations of this ban.&lt;ref&gt;Peachey, Paul.

Retrieved 2012-01-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Qatar, the [[Emir of Qatar]], [[Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani|Hamad Al Thani]], banned child jockeys in 2005&lt;ref name=GUK&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/life/thisweek/story/0,12977,1458529,00.html Can robots ride camels?] by Ian Sample, ''[[The Guardian]]'', Thursday, 2005-04-14&lt;/ref&gt; and directed that, by 2007, all camel races would be directed by [[robot jockey|robotic jockey]]s.&lt;ref name=Wired&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.11/camel.html?pg=1&amp;topic=camel&amp;topic_set= "Robots of Arabia"] by Jim Lewis, ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', Issue 13.11, November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''carrom ball''' (also known as the '''sodukku ball''' in parts of India) is a style of [[spin bowling]] delivery used in [[cricket]]. The ball is released by flicking it between the thumb and a bent middle finger in order to impart spin. Though the delivery was first brought in use in early 1940s, it was re-introduced by [[Ajantha Mendis]] in 2008 as well as by Indian spinner [[Ravichandran Ashwin]] later.
[[Image:Iverson grip 1950.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Iverson's unique bowling grip]]

==Origin and history==
The first bowler known to have used this style of delivery was the Australian [[Jack Iverson]]&lt;ref name="Jack Iverson Player Profile"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/5980.html |accessdate=2011-08-09 |title=Jack Iverson Player Profile |publisher=cricinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], who used it throughout his [[Test cricket]] career in the period after the Second World War, although he did not use the name "carrom ball". Fellow countryman [[John Gleeson (cricketer)|John Gleeson]] used a similar grip a decade later,&lt;ref name="John Gleeson Player Profile"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/5398.html |accessdate=2011-08-09 |title=John Gleeson Player Profile |publisher=cricinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by the end of the 1970s the method was almost forgotten. It has since re-entered cricketing consciousness because of its use by [[Ajantha Mendis]] of [[Sri Lanka cricket team|Sri Lanka]], with the new name of carrom ball. Mendis unveiled this delivery during the [[2008 Asia Cup]].&lt;ref name="Ajantha Mendis Player Profile"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/sri-lanka-v-australia-2011/content/player/268739.html |accessdate=2011-08-09 |title=Ajantha Mendis Player Profile |publisher=cricinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ravichandran Ashwin]] calls his variation the 'sodukku ball'. In the [[Tamil language]], sodukku means "snapping of fingers". This is reflected in the way the ball is delivered, by a "snap" of the middle finger and the thumb. Ashwin says that he first learned to bowl this type of delivery playing street cricket in [[Chennai]], while using a tennis ball, and later in his childhood he perfected the delivery with a real cricket ball.&lt;ref name="The Spinner Who Thrives On Pressure"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/517887.html |accessdate=2011-08-09 |title=The Spinner Who Thrives On Pressure |publisher=cricinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took nine wickets in his debut Test against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in November 2011 and used the carrom ball to dismiss [[Marlon Samuels]] in the second innings. New Zealander [[Mitchell Santner]] is believed to be the first left handed spin bowler to have used the method in international cricket, dismissing Pakistan opener [[Fakhar Zaman (cricketer)|Fakhar Zaman]] with a delivery in the carrom ball style during a one-day international match on January 16, 2018 &lt;ref&gt;https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/cricket/100629401/mitchell-santner-unveils-miracle-ball-to-completely-bamboozle-pakistan-batsman&lt;/ref&gt;.
==Method==
The [[cricket ball|ball]] is held between the thumb, forefinger and the middle finger and, instead of a conventional release, the ball is squeezed out and flicked by the fingers like a [[carrom]] player flicking the disc on a carrom board. It is different from wrist-bowled deliveries. Traditional leg-spin is bowled with anti-clockwise wrist movement for a right-armed bowler, while [[Muttiah Muralitharan]]'s special type of off-spin is bowled with clockwise wrist movement. A finger-bowled delivery such as traditional off-spin is bowled with a clockwise finger movement. '''Carrom spin''' can be considered a third category of spin bowling after leg spin and off spin, as the middle finger and thumb flick or squeeze the ball out of the hand, like a carrom player flicking a striker in the indoor game of [[carrom]]. When the centre finger is gripped towards the leg side, the ball spins from leg to off; when the centre finger is gripped towards the off side, the ball spins from off to leg. Depending on the degree the ball is gripped towards the leg side, the carrom ball could also travel straight. The carrom ball can therefore spin to either the off or leg sides or travel straight (as opposed to the popular misconception that it only spins towards the off side).

'''Changi Sailing Club''' ([[Abbreviation]]: '''CSC'''; [[Simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: 樟宜帆船俱乐部) is a [[sailing]] [[Club (organization)|club]] located in [[Changi]], in the North-East of [[Singapore]]. It regularly organises and holds competitions for both [[Dinghy|dinghies]] as well as [[keelboat]]s. Started in 1936, the club has had a rich history and is known for having produced notable sailors such as [[Benedict Tan]], [[Siew Shaw Her]], and more recently, [[Teo Wee Chin]]. It was originally the Royal Air Force sailing club alongside RAF Changi.  The Sembawang Dockyard history also gives little mention of the years it was a Royal Naval Dockyard.

The club houses a bar where patrons can enjoy the seaview. The bar offers drinks and finger food.

== History ==
44 years before the opening of Clipper Magazine Stadium and the Lancaster Barnstormers' inaugural season, the [[Lancaster Red Roses]] entertained baseball enthusiasts for 20 years at [[Stumpf Field]]. Efforts for a new stadium and a new team began in 1987, and what was a long sixteen-year battle finally paid off with an announcement in 2003. The Commonwealth of [[Pennsylvania]] agreed to fund roughly half of the cost with [[Opening Day Partners]] and the city of Lancaster covering the remainder. The original plan in 2001 called for a proposed, $20-million ballpark to be constructed on the Diseley Farm site, across from Long's Park in [[Manheim Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Manheim Township]].  However, those plans were cancelled because of residential concerns about traffic and political concerns about the use of [[eminent domain]] and rezoning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.lancasteronline.com/local/4/234730 Diseley Farm ballpark] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310105240/http://articles.lancasteronline.com/local/4/234730 |date=2009-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After this plan was terminated, most Lancaster County politicians preferred a downtown ballpark in order to revitalize a run-down neighborhood. The Redevelopment Authority of the County of Lancaster settled on an industrial site on the corner of North Prince and Frederick streets, where a company called Ace Rents existed. Initially, Ace Rents stalled the process, but quickly came to an agreement as they did not want to cause delay.&lt;ref name="Aces Rents relocated"&gt;[http://www.lchra.com/lchra_2008/07_reports_documents/newsletters/2004%20spring%20newletter%20files/spring%202004.htm Aces Rents relocated] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624105808/http://www.lchra.com/lchra_2008/07_reports_documents/newsletters/2004%20spring%20newletter%20files/spring%202004.htm |date=2009-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The groundbreaking ceremony was held on April 28, 2004, and Clipper Magazine Stadium was finished just before it opened on May 11, 2005.

With its brick façade and steel beams, the architecture of Clipper Magazine Stadium alludes to its industrial surroundings.  Located in Lancaster's [[Northwest Corridor (Lancaster)|Northwest Corridor]], the ballpark faces many downtown factories and is itself constructed over a former rail yard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openingdaypartners.com/design.cfm Clipper's architecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003135035/http://www.openingdaypartners.com/design.cfm |date=2011-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coincidentally, this section of Lancaster city (between North Mary and North Charlotte Streets, south of the Harrisburg Pike) was historically known as the "base ball ground", circa 1886.&lt;ref name="Aces Rents relocated"/&gt;

===2007 Atlantic League All-Star Game===
In July 2007, the Lancaster Barnstormers hosted the Atlantic League All-Star Game at Clipper Magazine Stadium.  The league's former North Division won, 8-6.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlanticleague.com/cgi-bin/news/news.cgi?id=1184283743 2007 All-Star Game] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123163537/http://www.atlanticleague.com/cgi-bin/news/news.cgi?id=1184283743 |date=2007-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ballpark attractions==

Clipper Magazine Stadium includes 6,000 green, chair-back seats in two levels divided by an open, 360° concourse. It also features other seating options such as luxury suites with professional catering, lawn seating that expands the ballpark's seating capacity to 7,500, and bleachers along the left-field wall. Additionally, the venue has three entertainment venues for children: the [[Weis Markets|Weis]] Horse Around Corral featuring a carousel, jungle gyms, a rock climbing wall, and various inflatables; Cylo's Clubhouse that allows for youth to interact with the Barnstormers' bovine mascot, [[Lancaster Barnstormers#Mascot|Cylo]]; and the [[Turkey Hill (company)|Turkey Hill]] Birthday Zone that hosts birthday celebrations.

Scott]]. Scott was a former Lancaster mayor (1974–1979) who initiated the civic effort toward Clipper Magazine Stadium.

One of the ballpark's highlights is Hess’ Picnic Pavilion, a concession stand with a red barn façade that includes a traditional ballpark menu with an emphasis on items produced in Lancaster County.  This emphasis includes Hess’s BBQ (a four-time Pennsylvania state [[barbecue]] champion),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Fans Can Chow Down On Hess’s Bbq In Amelia’s Picnic Pavilion | work=Lancaster Barnstormers | url=http://lancasterbarnstormers.com/news.cfm?newsID=567 | accessdate=February 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Auntie Anne's]] soft pretzels, [[Kunzler &amp; Company, Inc.|Kunzler]] hot dogs, beer from the [[Lancaster Brewing Company]], and [[Turkey Hill (company)|Turkey Hill]] ice cream and iced tea.  Other regional foods provided at Clipper Magazine Stadium include [[cheesesteak]]s and [[whoopie pie]]s.

Before the 2013 Atlantic League season, the Lancaster Barnstormers made a series of improvements to Clipper Magazine Stadium. The first of these was a new playground for children along the third-base line featuring a foam-based protective floor. Other improvements included a renovated picnic area with new tents and a deck comprising synthetic materials instead of wood, a new right-field wall, landscaping beyond the outfield, and computerized irrigation controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Home Run Harbor| work=Lancaster Barnstormers | url=http://lancasterbarnstormers.com/news.cfm?newsID=1153 | accessdate=April 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Home Run Harbor===

Prior to the 2008 season, a unique feature was added to Clipper Magazine Stadium:  Home Run Harbor, a 36,000-gallon, artificial pond with 10 bumper boats equipped with water cannons, a small waterfall, and a bridge. An estimated 30% of the home runs at the ballpark are hit toward the Home Run Harbor area, making the location a great place to see long-ball action. Safety netting prevented incoming baseballs from injuring patrons of the attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Home Run Harbor| work=Lancaster Barnstormers | url=http://lancasterbarnstormers.com/news.cfm?newsID=334 | accessdate=April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bumper boats attraction was closed after the 2015 season.

===Silverball Museum Arcade===

The Lancaster Barnstormers added the Silverball Museum Arcade in time for the 2011 Atlantic League season.  It is a coin-free attraction that includes nostalgic arcade games from the 1930s to some of the video games played in the present.  Each machine possesses a description of its history and inspiration.  The Silverball Museum Arcade also has televisions and multimedia detailing everything pinball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Pinball Museum to Open at Clipper Magazine Stadium | work=Ballpark Business | url=http://ballparkbiz.wordpress.com/2011/04/26/pinball-museum-to-open-at-clipper-magazine-stadium/#more-18816 | accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stitches Sculpture===

In late 2012, an artist named Derek Parker installed his baseball stitches sculpture along Clipper Magazine Stadium's main walkway on North Prince Street. It symbollically links the ballpark to Lancaster city. As the sixth Poetry Paths project completed by [[Franklin &amp; Marshall College]]'s Writer's House, the stitches also tie professional baseball and the arts. It includes the Le Hinton poem called "Our Ballpark" and is part of a $250,000 initiative by the Lancaster County Community Foundation to add art and poetry into Lancaster city's urban environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Sculptor has Lancaster city's ballpark in stitches| work=Lancaster Online| url=http://lancasteronline.com/article/local/714946_Sculptor-has-Lancaster-city-s-ballpark-in-stitches.html | accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LeSean McCoy Celebrity Softball Game===

In 2012, the Barnstormers held its first annual celebrity softball game, which was hosted by [[LeSean McCoy]], an [[All-Pro]] running back on the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] native.

[[File:Shirley Heights.jpg|thumb|''[[Shirley Heights (horse)|Shirley Heights]]'', Derby winner by [[Bob Demuyser]] (1920-2003)]]
The '''Irish Derby''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: '''Dearbaí na hÉireann''') is a [[Group races|Group 1]] [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in Ireland open to three-year-old [[thoroughbred]] [[Colt (horse)|colts]] and [[Filly|fillies]]. It is run at the [[Curragh Racecourse|Curragh]] over a distance of 1 mile and 4 furlongs (2,414 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late June or early July.

It is Ireland's equivalent of the [[Epsom Derby]], and it is currently held three weeks after the English race.

==History==
The earliest version of the Irish Derby was an event called the O'Darby Stakes. This was established in 1817, but it was discontinued after 1824. A subsequent race titled the Curragh Derby was inaugurated in 1848, but this was again short-lived.

The modern Irish Derby was created by the [[Earl of Howth|3rd Earl of Howth]], the [[Henry Moore, 3rd Marquess of Drogheda|3rd Marquess of Drogheda]] and the [[James Caulfeild, 3rd Earl of Charlemont|3rd Earl of Charlemont]]. It was first run in 1866, and it was initially contested over 1 mile, 6 furlongs and 3 yards. It was extended by 9 yards in 1869, and cut to its present distance in 1872. The first Epsom Derby winner to achieve victory in the Irish version was [[Orby (horse)|Orby]], trained in Ireland by Fred McCabe, in 1907.

The Irish Derby became a major international race in 1962, when its prize money was substantially increased. [[Joseph McGrath (Irish politician)|Joe McGrath]], a founder of the [[Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake]], combined the race with the sweepstake, and it became known as the Irish Sweeps Derby. The event began to regularly attract the winners of the Epsom Derby, and [[Santa Claus (horse)|Santa Claus]] became the second horse to win both races in 1964.

The Irish Derby was sponsored by [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] from 1986 to 2007, and it has been backed by Dubai Duty Free since 2008. It is currently staged on the second day of the Curragh's three-day Irish Derby Festival meeting.

A total of eighteen horses have now completed the English-Irish Derby double, and the most recent was [[Harzand (horse)|Harzand]] in 2016.

* William Brophy, Herbertstown House, Two-Mile-House, Naas, Co. Kildare. Farmer, Breeder and Owner 
In 1880 William Brophy completed a unique double by owning the winner of both the Irish Derby with King of the Bees and the Irish Grand National with Controller.   Also uniquely both winners were out of the same Dam Winged Bee.

'''Lawrence Donegan''' (born 13 July 1961), is a Scottish [[musician]], [[journalist]], and former golf correspondent for ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lawrencedonegan Lawrence Donegan], ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt;

Donegan was born on 13 July 1961 in [[Stirling, Scotland|Stirling]], and educated at [[St Modan's High School]] in Stirling and at the [[University of Glasgow]], where his musical career began. He was the [[bassist]] in [[The Bluebells]], whose biggest hit was "Young at Heart," and [[Lloyd Cole and the Commotions]]. After Lloyd Cole and the Commotions split, Donegan became a journalist and an author. In between times he worked as the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] assistant to [[Brian Wilson (Labour politician)|Brian Wilson]] MP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://celticunderground.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=357:celtic-underground-podcast-97-golf-politics-and-rock-a-roll&amp;catid=34:audio&amp;Itemid=58 Celtic Underground Podcast 97 - Golf, Politics and Rock &amp; Roll], 9 July 2010, accessed 11 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; While in that role, he was part of a one-off band called the Stop Its that recorded an anti-[[Tax per head|poll tax]] song of a similar name. The band also included David Hill, later press spokesman for [[Tony Blair]].&lt;ref&gt;Pendennis [http://politics.guardian.co.uk/diary/story/0,,1041884,00.html Spin those discs], 14 September 2003, accessed 13 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and Tim Luckhurst, who later became editor of the ''Scotsman'' newspaper and is Professor of Journalism at the University of Kent.  In the late 1980s Donegan made a number of appearances with South London football team, Belair Casuals FC.  Donegan is a now golf journalist for ''The Guardian'', having previously worked at ''[[The Scotsman]]''. He has held a post with the former publication since 2004, although he has been at the newspaper since 1994, as a general reporter and then as the Scotland Correspondent from 1997-2004.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; During the [[2010 Olympics|2010 Winter Olympics]], Donegan gained notoriety for his overly critical reviews of the games. Journalists believed that his harsh reviews and similar critiques coming from the British media were made as an attempt to make the games look bad as the following Olympics would be held in London.&lt;ref&gt;Huffington Post [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andy-miah/why-britains-media-are-fa_b_470119.html Why Britain’s Media are Failing at The Vancouver Olympic Games], 22 April 2010, accessed 22 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, ''[[The Guardian]]'' made a tongue-in-cheek reference to the severe criticism of the prior games by the British by inviting a Canadian journalist to similarly critique the [[2012 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics in London]] as the 'worst ever'.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian [https://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/the-worst-olympics-ever The worst Olympics ever], 29 July 2012, accessed 22 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
His golf writing is most famous for prematurely writing off a number of golfers careers including golfer Darren Clarke with the acidic words "continues their inexorable descent towards golfing irrelevance" before Darren Clarke later went on to win the British Open.
 
He has written non-fiction books:
*'''''Four Iron in the Soul:''''' (Penguin, 1998) - the story of his year caddying for [[Ross Drummond]], the 438th best golfer in the world at the time, also published as ''Maybe It Should Have Been A 3-Iron'' in [[North America]].
*'''''California Dreaming: A Smooth-running, Low-mileage, Cut-price American Adventure:''''' (Washington Square Press, 1999) - about the time he spent as a [[used-car salesman]] in the [[United States]]
*'''''No News at Throat Lake:''''' (Penguin, 2000) - about working for a bi-weekly newspaper in the small [[County Donegal]] village of [[Creeslough]] in the west of [[Ulster]].
*'''''Quiet Please:''''' (Yellow Jersey Press, 2004) - about his experiences as a [[Ryder Cup]] steward.
*'''''Shergar:''' The Final Word'' - (HarperCollins 2009) The story of the kidnapping of the world famous race horse, [[Shergar]].

The '''Met Center''' was an [[indoor arena]] that stood in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]], United States, a suburb of [[Minneapolis]]. The arena, which was completed in 1967 by Minnesota Ice, just to the north of [[Metropolitan Stadium]], seated 15,000. It was best known as the home of the [[Minnesota North Stars]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) from 1967 to 1993. For its first 15 years, its official name was the '''Metropolitan Sports Center'''; the more familiar shorter name was adopted in 1982.

The Met's other tenants included the ABA's [[Minnesota Muskies]], which played just one season before moving to Miami for the 1968-69 season. The league responded by moving the defending champion [[Pittsburgh Pipers]] to Bloomington, but the Pipers left to return to Pittsburgh after the season. The [[North American Soccer League (1968–1984)|NASL]]'s [[Minnesota Kicks]] played two indoor seasons at the Met from 1979 to 1981.  The [[Minnesota Strikers]] of the [[Major Soccer League]] (MISL) played indoor soccer at the Met Center from 1984 to 1988. The [[Minnesota high school boys hockey|Boys' High School Hockey Tournament]] was also held there from 1969 to 1975.

The arena also held entertainment-related shows, including the very first performance of ''[[Sesame Street Live]]'' in September 1980.

==History==
The Met Center was considered to be one of the finest arenas in the NHL for many years, both for its sightlines, and its ice surface. Among NHL players, the Met was known for its fast ice and good lighting. Players also had much praise for the locker rooms and training facilities. The Met never boasted fancy amenities, and by comparison to modern arenas it had cramped concourses and very few frills (though some luxury suites were added in the 1980s). As a sports facility, it could best be described as utilitarian, a theme which repeated itself in most Minnesota sports facilities built before 1988 (such as Metropolitan Stadium and the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]]). Like the Metrodome, the Met Center was heavily utilized as a Minnesota sports venue, hosting various high school hockey and basketball events over the course of its lifetime. Here are North Stars in action in the 1991 Clarence Campbell Finals Game 2 at Edmonton.

After the North Stars moved to [[Dallas, Texas]] in 1993 and became the [[Dallas Stars]], the Met Center was demolished on December 13, 1994 in a series of three [[building implosion|controlled implosions]].  The series of implosions was required after the initial detonation (which was intended to be the only one) failed spectacularly to bring down the building on live television. &lt;ref&gt;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7-zf_DgpDic&lt;/ref&gt; The NHL returned to Minnesota in 2000 when the expansion [[Minnesota Wild]] began play at [[Xcel Energy Center]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]].  Meanwhile, the [[Harlem Globetrotters]], an annual visitor to the Met Center, moved on, as had a large portion of Met Center's concert business, to [[Target Center]].

For several years after the arena was demolished, the property served as an overflow lot for the [[Mall of America]]. In 2004, an [[IKEA]] store opened on the west end of the property, and the new American Boulevard was rerouted through the east end of the property.  The remainder of the site is planned long-term to become the site of Mall of America Phase II, of which the IKEA would be an anchor store.

'''Notwane FC''' is a [[Association football|football]] club from [[Botswana]] based in [[Gaborone]]. It is named after the [[Notwane River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://botswanapremierleague.com/team/2842/Notwane/253/Botswana-Premier-League-2014-15/|title=Notwane|publisher=Botswana Premier League}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwane is owned by GMG Global Investments, a subsidiary of GMG Holdings  and recently made major scoop by signing former South African international players, former [[Orlando Pirates]] player [[Benedict Vilakazi (soccer)|Benedict Vilakazi]] and former [[Mamelodi Sundowns F.C.|Mamelodi Sundowns]] player [[Manqoba Ngwenya]]{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==History==
Notwane were founded in 1965 and played in the first season of the Botswana Premier League.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3067">The '''Paul Sauvé Arena''' was an [[indoor arena]] located at 4000 Beaubien Est. in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], in its [[Rosemont, Quebec|Rosemont]] district. Built in 1960 and demolished in 1992-93, the arena had a capacity of 4,000 people. It was named after [[Paul Sauvé]] (March 24, 1907 – January 2, 1960), a Quebec Premier with the Union Nationale. 

The arena hosted some of the most important events in modern Quebec political history. It was the site of the [[Parti Québécois]] election victory celebrations on November 15, 1976 and on April 13, 1981. Additionally, it was the site of two of the most important moments of the [[Quebec referendum, 1980|1980 referendum]]. On May 14, 1980 [[Pierre Trudeau]] delivered his "first among equals" speech that was his major contribution to the campaign battle, and [[René Lévesque]] delivered his passionate concession speech on May 20, 1980.

The Paul Sauvé Arena was, most popularly, the home to Quebec professional wrestling. In the mid-1960s, [[Johnny Rougeau]] and partner [[Bob Langevin]] created "Les As de la Lutte" (Wrestling Aces) and made the arena its main venue for wrestling shows, which ran from 1965 to 1975. The arena was also home to a founding franchise in the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]]. The [[Rosemont National]] played two seasons (from 1969 to 1971, finishing 8th and 9th) before moving to Laval. In the late 1960s the Montreal Canadiens lacrosse team played in the arena, and rock concerts including those performed by [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], and [[Eric Burdon and The Animals]]. Finally, boxing was always a big draw, and the arena saw many memorable fights.

On a more prestigious note, it also hosted preliminary [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|volleyball]] matches at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]]. Before decay, costs and low attendances doomed the arena, it was used for curling hall, and later a bingo hall, a gymnasium, a bowling alley, and trade shows.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6867">'''Skurfing''' as a sport has two common forms: "water skurfing" and "street skurfing".

==Water Skurfing==
[[File:GoonBoySkurfing.jpg|350px|right|thumb|A person water skurfing]]

Water Skurfing was inspired by an unknown man being pulled by a boat on a surfboard in Lake Havasu, AZ. Water Skurfing is a form of [[water skiing]] that uses a [[surfboard]] or similar board instead of skis.  The skurfer is towed behind a [[motorboat]] at planing speed with a tow rope similar to that of [[kneeboarding|Knee Boarding]] and [[wakeboarding]].  It shares an advantage with kneeboarding in that the motorboat does not require as much speed as it does for water skiing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.streetdirectory.com/etoday/great-tips-on-how-to-skurf-upaful.html|title=Great Tips On How To Skurf|last=|first=|date=|website=Street Directory|publisher=|access-date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skurfing is a towsport and it is very similar to water skiing. The skurfboard, however, is a surfboard and is usually shorter by about two feet, wider and has three larger fins that make the board easier to manoeuvre while being pulled behind a boat. The planing speed of the motorboat is equivalent to the speed generated by a wave and allows the skurfer to ride behind the boat the same way a surfer would ride a wave. One of the advantages of skurfing when compared with surfing is that when the water is flat, skurfing is still possible. Skurfing can be done behind a boat or a jet ski on a river or in an ocean. The manoeuvres on a skurfboard are similar to those on a surfboard, these include.
* cut-backs  
* 180
* 360
* aerial jumps
* power slides
* freeriding

Freeriding is when the wake is surfed without the rope. First the rider pulls themselves up the rope so that they are skurfing in the largest part of the wake. The rider then gently pumps the board to maintain speed and moves their weight further forward to help them stay on the wake wave. Once they are being propelled by the wake the rope is thrown back into the boat.

Skurfing has developed into its own unique sport but has also been used in adapting other sports such as surfing. Before skurfing was invented there were limitations to paddling onto larger waves when surfing because surfers lacked the speed needed to stay in front of the wave. Skurfing has shown the world the potential of big wave surfing by towing the surfer towards big waves. Therefore, giving the surfer the speed needed to catch the wave successfully.

The early usage was a [[portmanteau]] of skiing (as in [[water skiing]]) and [[surfing]], and was used to describe a popular [[Surface Water Sports|surface water sport]] in which the participant is towed on a surfboard behind a boat with a ski rope.

Although the "Skurfer" (a branded water-sport product) was originally trademarked by a surfer named Tony Finn in the mid 1980s, the word 'Skurfing' was potentially first coined in New Zealand by surfboard shaper Allan Byrne. Allan Byrne lent a surfboard to Jeff Darby and friends in Queensland Australia who started to make their own and later came in contact with Tony Finn who was to later produce the brand Skurfer' under royalty.

Many years prior to Tony Finn and the 'Skurfer', Australian surfboard shaper and inventor Bruce McKee along with associate Mitchell Ross, launched the world's first 
mass-produced plastic roto-moulded construction 'Skurfboard' named the 'Mcski', later renamed 'SSS' skiboard and then 'Wake-snake' in Australia. The board had adjustable rubber foot-straps, concave tunnel bottom and a keel fin. Two smaller side fins were later added for greater hold and more maneuverability.

Bruce McKee and associate Mitchell Ross negotiated with USA's Medalist Waterskis and the first American production was launched.
The launch of the product's American version being named the 'Surf-Ski' was in 1984 at Chicagos 'IMTEC' show. At the show McKee also met Tony Finn who was the proposed Californian representative. 
Tony Finn, went on to do his own negotiations with Darby and company from Australia and the result as mentioned above were the US boards later launched under the 'Skurfer' brand name.
    
Surfing is highly popular in the state of [[Western Australia]] and in many other places in the world. Unlike most other water sports where the participant is towed, water skurfing is not a professional sport and has no official competitions. It is a freestyle sport with highly individualistic style and form. There are no defined styles or conventions, rather it is about personal style.

Water Skurfing is considered by many to be a precursor to [[wakeboarding]], as the skurfboards evolved in the late 1980s into compression-moulded products (aka "skiboards") then eventually into the twin-tipped [[Wakeboard]].

=== Styles ===
There are two main styles of water skurfing, the noseriding style, mostly used by people who surf on a longboard. The alternative is with cutbacks, carves and other turns. Some skurfers even get air over the wake.

A new style of water skurfing has recently emerged in the sport where the fins are removed from the bottom of the board. This finless style requires more balance and finesse than having the fins attached. Not having fins limits cutbacks and carving, but allows the rider to spin the board around in a 360-degree rotation.

==Street Skurfing==
[[File:Caster skates.jpg|right|thumb|A person street skurfing]]
This usage is a [[portmanteau]] of [[Skateboarding]] and [[Surfing]]. See also [[Freeline skates]].

Street Skurfing is the melding of many elements of skateboarding with the technical and practically applicable skills gained from slalom, downhill, or any other side-sport disciplines such as surfing, snowboarding, skateboarding, and casterboarding. It focuses heavily on spins, slides, "[[Human positions|stance]]" changes, and carving. There are no set rules, tricks, or techniques except the heavy emphasis of a fluid and surf-like execution through a course. The usually adopted terrain is a mix of steep grade roads, driveways, concrete banks, and ditches.

=== Styles ===

There are two types of styles for street skurfing.  The first style involves a single board (often a skateboard or custom-cut deck).  The second style is actually a common term used for caster skating.  It involves two separated boards or skates instead of a single skateboard. One of the advantages of having separated skates is that the rider can maneuver with both feet individually.  In addition, Street Skurfing involves making much tighter turns, s-shape motions, and even travelling up and down hills.

[[File:Speedsuit.jpg|thumb|A woman wearing a speedsuit in a [[triathlon]]]]

A '''speedsuit''' is an item of [[unisex]] exercise attire or an industrial uniform used when quick clothing changes are necessary. It is either a single piece of clothing which tightly fits the torso and, optionally, varying amounts of the arms and legs; overall, it is similar to a [[leotard]], though intentionally made especially tight and constricting to hug the body for varying purposes of warmth (when used in [[snowboarding]] or [[skiing]]) and [[hydrodynamics]] (when used in swimming and other water sports), or it is a tight fitting collared [[jumpsuit]] similar to [[coveralls]].

==In popular culture==
A running gag in ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'', beginning with the episode "[[Hate Floats]]" is [[Dr. Venture]]'s assertions regarding the superiority of a "[[boilersuit|speedsuit]]" and his desire to outfit his son [[List_of_The_Venture_Bros._characters#Team_Venture|Dean]] in a speedsuit, initially for his birthday and later as a rite of passage. A gag in the initial episode mentions how a speedsuit is what a "super-scientist" wears "for the rest of his life", and explanation within the [[Fictional universe|imagined reality]] of the show for the reason why animated characters are always shown in the same clothing and animated in the same outfits regardless of the circumstance.

'''The exchange''' in [[chess]] refers to a situation in which one player loses a [[minor piece]] (i.e. a [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]] or [[Knight (chess)|knight]]) but captures the opponent's [[Rook (chess)|rook]].  The side which wins the rook is said to have ''won the exchange'', while the other player has ''lost the exchange'', since the rook is usually [[Chess piece relative value|more valuable]]. Alternatively, the side that has won the rook is ''up the exchange'', and the other player is ''down the exchange''. The opposing captures often happen on consecutive moves, although this is not strictly necessary.  It is generally detrimental to lose the exchange, although occasionally one may find reason to purposely do so; the result is an [[#The exchange sacrifice|''exchange sacrifice'']] (see below). The [[#Minor exchange|''minor exchange'']] is an uncommon term for the exchange of a bishop and knight.

Note that ''the'' exchange differs from the more general "[[Exchange (chess)|exchange]]" or "an exchange", which refers to the loss and subsequent gain of arbitrary pieces, for example to "exchange queens" would mean that each side's queen is [[capture (chess)|captured]] {{harv|Hooper|Whyld|1992|p=130}}.

The value of the exchange (i.e. the difference between a rook and a minor piece) has been considered for decades.  [[Siegbert Tarrasch]] put its value as 1½ [[pawn (chess)|pawns]] in the [[Chess endgame|endgame]], but not for the [[chess opening|opening]] or the first part of the [[Chess middlegame|middlegame]].  That is widely accepted today, but [[Jacob Sarratt]], [[Howard Staunton]], and [[José Capablanca]] felt that the exchange was worth two pawns.  [[Tigran Petrosian]] thought that one pawn was the right value.  [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] said that a rook is slightly better than a knight and two pawns but slightly worse than a bishop and two pawns {{harvcol|Soltis|2004|p=110}}.  [[Cecil Purdy]] said that the value depends on the total number of pawns on the board.  The reason is that when there are many pawns, the rooks will have limited mobility because there will not be open [[file (chess)|files]].  The exchange is barely worth 1½ points when there are 14 or more pawns on the board.  Only when there are ten or fewer pawns may the exchange be worth 2 points  {{harvcol|Soltis|2004|p=134}}.  Purdy gave the value as 1½ points in the opening and increasing to 2 points in the endgame.  In the middlegame the value would be closer to 1½ than to 2 {{harvcol|Purdy|2003|pp=146–52}}.  [[Edmar Mednis]] gave the value as 1½ in the endgame {{harvcol|Mednis|1978|p=120}}, {{harvcol|Mednis|1987|p=107}}.  [[Max Euwe]] put the value at 1½ in the middlegame and said that two pawns are more than sufficient compensation for the exchange {{harvcol|Euwe|Kramer|1994|p=38}}. [[Larry Kaufman]]'s computer research puts the value as 1¾ pawns, but only 1¼ pawns if the player with the minor piece has the {{chessgloss|bishop pair}} {{harvcol|Soltis|2004|p=110}}.  [[Hans Berliner]] puts the difference between a rook and knight as 1.9 pawns and the difference between a rook and a bishop as 1.77 pawns {{harvcol|Berliner|1999|p=14}}.  In practice, one pawn may be sufficient compensation for the loss of the exchange, whereas two pawns almost always is {{harvcol|Soltis|2004|p=110}}.

==In the endgame==
In the middlegame, the advantage of an exchange is usually enough to win the game if the side with the rook has one or more pawns.  In an endgame without pawns, the advantage of the exchange is normally not enough to win (see [[pawnless chess endgame]]).  The most common exceptions when there are no pawns are (1) a rook versus a bishop in which the defending king is trapped in a corner of the same color as his bishop, (2) a knight separated from its king that may be cornered and lost, and (3) the king and knight are poorly placed {{harvcol|Nunn|2002|pp=9,31}}.

In the endgame of a rook and a pawn versus a knight and a pawn, if the pawns are [[passed pawn|passed]] the rook is much stronger and should win.  If the pawns are not passed, the side with knight has good [[draw (chess)|drawing]] chances if its pieces are well-placed {{harvcol|Müller|Lamprecht|2001|pp=260–63}}.

In the endgame of a rook and a pawn versus a bishop and pawn, If the pawns are on the same file, the bishop has good chances to draw if the pawns are blocked and the opposing pawn is on a square the bishop can attack; otherwise the rook usually wins.  If the pawns are passed the rook normally wins.  If the pawns are not passed and are on adjacent files, it is difficult to assess but the bishop may be able to draw {{harvcol|Müller|Lamprecht|2001|pp=274–79}}.

In an endgame with more pawns on the board (i.e. a rook and pawns versus a minor piece with the same number of pawns) the rook usually wins {{Harvcol|Müller|Lamprecht|2001|pp=256–91}}.  This position is typical.  The superior side should remember these things:
# the main idea is to get the king through to capture opposing pawns
# force as many opposing pawns as possible onto the same color square as the bishop
# some pawn exchanges may be necessary to open [[file (chess)|files]], but keep pawns on both sides of the board
# try to keep the position unbalanced. A passed pawn almost immediately becomes a winning advantage {{Harvcol|Fine|Benko|2003|pp=478–79}}.

If the minor piece has an extra pawn (i.e. one pawn for the exchange), the rook should win, but with difficulty.  If the minor piece has two extra pawns, the endgame should be a [[draw (chess)|draw]] {{Harvcol|Fine|Benko|2003|pp=478ff}}.

==The exchange sacrifice {{anchor|Exchange sacrifice|exchange sacrifice}}==
An ''exchange sacrifice'' occurs when one player gives up a rook for a minor piece. It is often used to destroy the enemy [[pawn structure]] (as in several variations of the [[Sicilian Defence]] where Black [[capture (chess)|captures]] a knight on c3 with a rook), to establish a minor piece on a strong square (often threatening the enemy king), to improve one's own pawn structure (creating, for example, [[connected pawns|connected]] [[passed pawn]]s such as in [http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1031758 A Yurgis vs. Botvinnik, 1931]), or to gain time for development.  The exchange sacrifice contrasts with other [[sacrifice (chess)|sacrifices]] in that during the early-middle to middle game the board is sufficiently crowded to where the rook is not as effective as an active knight or a good bishop, this is why such exchange sacrifices happen usually from moves 20 to 30, and rarely occur in the later moves. When they do occur in the endgame, it is usually to create and [[promotion (chess)|promote]] a [[passed pawn]] {{harvcol|Soltis|2004|p=115}}.  Subsequently, the relative importance of the pieces might be different than the standardized [[Chess piece relative value]] system and takes advantage of the fluctuating values of the pieces during the progression of the game.  The sacrifice might also be used to increase the influence of one's own minor pieces by eliminating opposition from their counterparts (such as in the Petrosian versus Spassky game below, where even a double exchange sacrifice was successful).  A common example of this idea is the elimination an opponent's bishop, with the expectation that in doing so one's own bishop will increase in power from being unopposed on the color squares in which it resides.  There is often more dynamic play and positional considerations such as pawn structure or piece placement compared to sacrifices due to a mating attack or a pawn sacrifice to gain the initiative.  Sometimes the exchange can be sacrificed purely on long term positional objectives, as frequently demonstrated by former world champion [[Tigran Petrosian]].

[[Tigran Petrosian]], the [[world chess championship|World Champion]] from 1963–1969, was well known for his especially creative use of this device. He once responded (only half jokingly), when asked what was his favourite piece, as saying "The rook, because I can sacrifice it for minor pieces!"{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} In the game [[Samuel Reshevsky|Reshevsky]] versus Petrosian at the 1953 [[Candidates Tournament]] in Zurich,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1106248 Reshevsky vs. Petrosian, 1953]&lt;/ref&gt; he sacrificed the exchange on move 25, only for his opponent to sacrifice it in return on move 30. This game is perhaps the most famous and most frequently taught example of the exchange sacrifice.

There are no open [[file (chess)|files]] in this position for the rooks to exploit. Black sacrificed the exchange with 
: '''25... Re6!!'''
With the rook not on e7, the black knight will be able to get to a strong [[outpost (chess)|outpost]] on d5.  From there the knight will be attacking the pawn on c3, and if the white bishop on b2 does not move to d2, it will be of little use.  In addition, it will be practically impossible to break Black's defense on the white squares.  The next few moves were:
: '''26. a4?! Ne7!'''
: '''27. Bxe6 fxe6'''
: '''28. Qf1! Nd5'''
: '''29. Rf3 Bd3'''
: '''30. Rxd3 cxd3'''
The game was drawn on move 41 {{harvcol|Kasparov|2004|p=14}}.

Black [[resign (chess)|resigned]] because the position was a winning endgame for White (two knights and five pawns versus one knight and four pawns) {{harvcol|Kasparov|2004|pp=72–74}}.

Rxb7!!'''.  As compensation for the sacrifice, Black became weak on the white squares, which were dominated by White's bishop.  The exchange sacrifice also deprived Black of the [[bishop pair]] and his remaining bishop was a [[bad bishop]].  Black returned the exchange on move 28, making the [[material (chess)|material]] equal, but White had a strong [[initiative (chess)|initiative]].  Black missed a better 28th move after which White could have forced a draw, but would have had no clear advantage.  White won the game on move 38 {{harvcol|Nunn|2001|pp=149–58}}.

==Minor exchange==
The '''minor exchange''' refers to the capture of the opponent's [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] for the player's [[knight (chess)|knight]] (or, more recently, the stronger [[minor piece]] for the weaker) {{harvcol|Soltis|2004|p=169}}.  [[Bobby Fischer]] used the term {{harvcol|Benko|2007|pp=192,199,216}}, but it is rarely used.

In most chess positions, a bishop is worth slightly more than a knight because of its longer range of movement.  As a chess game progresses, [[pawn (chess)|pawn]]s tend to get traded, removing support points from the knight and opening up lines for the bishop. This generally leads to the bishop's advantage increasing over time.

Traditional [[chess theory]] espoused by masters such as [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] and [[Siegbert Tarrasch]] puts more value on the bishop than the knight.  In contrast, the [[Hypermodernism (chess)|hypermodern]] school favored the knight over the bishop.  Modern theory is that it depends on the position, but that there are more positions where the bishop is better than where the knight is better {{harvcol|Mayer|1997|p=7}}.

There are some occasions when a knight can be worth more than a bishop, so this exchange is not necessarily made at every opportunity to do so.

A rook and bishop usually work better together than a rook and knight in the endgame {{harvcol|Mayer|1997|pp=201–8}}, {{harvcol|Beliavsky|Mikhalchishin|2000|p=141}}. [[José Raúl Capablanca]] stated that a queen and knight work better together than a queen and bishop in the endgame {{harvcol|Mayer|1997|pp=209–18}}. More recently, [[John L. Watson|John Watson]] has stated that from his study of this endgame that an unusually large proportion of queen and knight versus queen and bishop endings are drawn, and that most decisive games are characterized by the winning side having one or more obvious advantages (for example, having a knight against a bad bishop in a {{chessgloss|closed game|closed}} position, or having a bishop in a position with pawns on both sides of the board, particularly if the knight has no natural [[outpost (chess)|outpost]]). Watson states that positions in this endgame in general "are very volatile, and often the winning side is simply the one who starts out being able to win material or launch an attack on the opposing king" {{harvcol|Watson|1998|p=73}}.  [[Glenn Flear]] agrees with that assessment for endgames.  He could not find an endgame by Capablanca that supported his statement.  The statistics for queen and bishop versus queen and knight endgames are about even.  Most decisive games were won because of a significant advantage from the [[chess middlegame|middlegame]] and only a limited number of positions show an inherent superiority for one over the other {{harvcol|Flear|2007|p=422}}.
