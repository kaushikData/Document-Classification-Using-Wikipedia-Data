'''Adolf Dygasiński''' (March 7, 1839, [[Niegosławice, Pińczów County|Niegosławice]]–June 3, 1902, [[Grodzisk Mazowiecki]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] novelist, publicist and educator. In [[Polish literature]], he was one of the leading representatives of [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]]. 
==Life==
During his literary career, Dygasiński wrote forty-two short stories and novels. 
Since 1884 his works were being published in book-form and enjoyed considerable success. 
They were translated into Russian and German. 
In 1891, Dygasiński went on a trip to Brazil on a trail of Polish emigrants from [[Partitioned Poland]]. 
He produced a series of letters describing the tragic fate of Polish emigrees in South America. In the following years Dygasiński maintained a position of a tutor and coach for numerous wealthy landowning families. Late in life he settled in [[Warsaw]], where he died on June 6, 1902, and was buried at the local [[Powązkowski Cemetery]].

==Works== 
In his work Dygasiński often focused on topics of rural life and residents of small towns, highlighting the common fate of both, human and animal communities. Some of his most important work include: 

*Wilk, psy i ludzie (Wolf, dogs and humans; 1883) 
*Ogólne zasady pedagogiki dotyczące wykształcenia umysłu, uczuć, moralności i religijności (General principles of teaching in the education of mind, emotions, morality, and religion; 1883)

'''''Apeiron''''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|p|aɪ|r|ɒ|n}}; {{lang|grc|ἄπειρον}}) is a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning "(that which is) unlimited," "boundless", "infinite", or "indefinite"&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)/peiros2|ἄπειρον|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang|grc|ἀ-}} ''a-'', "without" and {{lang|grc|πεῖραρ}} ''peirar'', "end, limit", "boundary",&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pei{{=}}rar|πεῖραρ|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Ionic Greek]] form of {{lang|grc|πέρας}} ''peras'', "end, limit, boundary".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pe/ras|πέρας|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is akin to [[Persian language|Persian]] ''piramon'', meaning "boundary, circumference, surrounding".

==''Apeiron'' as an origin==
The ''apeiron'' is central to the [[cosmology|cosmological]] theory created by [[Anaximander]], a 6th-century BC [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] whose work is mostly lost.  From the few existing fragments, we learn that he believed the beginning or ultimate reality (''[[arche]]'') is eternal and infinite, or boundless (''apeiron''), subject to neither old age nor decay, which perpetually yields fresh materials from which everything we can perceive is derived.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Phys.'' Γ5, 204b, 23sq.&lt;DK12,A16.&gt;, Hippolytus, ''Haer.'' I 6, 1 sq. &lt;DK 12 A11, B2.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''Apeiron'' generated the [[Opposite (semantics)|opposite]]s (hot–cold, wet–dry, etc.) which acted on the creation of the world ([[cf.]] [[Heraclitus]]). Everything is generated from ''apeiron'' and then it is destroyed by going back to ''apeiron'', according to necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Simplicius, ''in Phys.'', p. 24, 13sq.&lt;DK 12 A9,B1.&gt;, p. 150, 24sq.&lt;DK 12 A9.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that infinite worlds are generated from ''apeiron'' and then they are destroyed there again.&lt;ref&gt;Aetius I 3,3&lt;Pseudo-Plutarch; DK 12 A14.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

His ideas were influenced by the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythical]] tradition and by his teacher [[Thales]] (7th to 6th century BC). Searching for some universal principle, Anaximander retained the traditional religious assumption that there was a cosmic order and tried to explain it rationally, using the old mythical language which ascribed divine control on various spheres of reality. This language was more suitable for a society which could see gods everywhere; therefore the first glimmerings of laws of nature were themselves derived from divine laws.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. World Publishing Co. Cleveland and New York. pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks believed that the universal principles could also be applied to human societies. The word ''nomos'' (law) may originally have meant ''natural law'' and used later to mean man-made law.&lt;ref&gt;L. H. Jeferry  (1976) ''The archaic Greece. The Greek city states 700-500 BC''. Ernest Benn Ltd. London &amp; Tonbridge p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek philosophy entered a high level of abstraction. It adopted ''apeiron'' as the origin of all things, because it is completely indefinite. This is a further transition from the previous existing [[mythical]] way of thought to the newer [[rationalism|rational]] way of thought which is the main characteristic of the [[Archaic period in Greece|archaic period]] (8th to 6th century BC). This shift in thought is correlated with the new political conditions in the Greek [[city states]] during the 6th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Vernant (1964) ''Les origins de la pensee grecque''. PUF Paris. p. 128; J. P. Vernant (1982) '' The origins of Greek thought''. Ithaca, Cornell University Press. pp. 118, 128. {{ISBN|0-8014-9293-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roots==
In the mythical [[Greece|Greek]] [[cosmogony]] of [[Hesiod]] (8th to 7th century BC) the first [[Greek primordial deities|primordial god]] is [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]], which is a void or gap. Chaos is described as a gap either between [[Tartarus]] and the earth's surface (Miller's interpretation) or between earth's surface and the sky (Cornford's interpretation).&lt;ref&gt;''The Theogony of Hesiod''. Transl. H. G. Evelyn White (1914): 116, 736-744 [http://www.sacred-tests.com/cla/hesiod/theogony/htm online]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'First of all': On the Semantics and Ethics of Hesiod's Cosmogony - Mitchell Miller - Ancient Philosophy (Philosophy Documentation Center)|url = https://www.pdcnet.org//pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=ancientphil&amp;id=ancientphil_2001_0021_0002_0251_0276&amp;onlyautologin=true|website = www.pdcnet.org|access-date = 2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Ritual Basis for Hesiod's Theogony|last = Cornford|first = Francis|publisher = |year = 1950|isbn = |location = |pages = 95–116|work = The Unwritten Philosophy and other Essays}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can name it also [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]] (having no bottom).

Alternately, Greek [[philosopher]] [[Thales]] believed that the origin or first principle was water. [[Pherecydes of Syros]] (6th century BC) probably called the water also ''Chaos'' and this is not placed at the very beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Presocratic philosophers|author=G.S. Kirk, J.E. Raven and M. Schofield|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFpd86J8PLsC&amp;pg |page=57| isbn =978-0-521-27455-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the creation stories of Near East the primordial world is described formless and empty. The only existing thing prior to creation was the water abyss. The Babylonian cosmology [[Enuma Elish]] describes the earliest stage of the universe as one of watery chaos and something similar is described in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|author=William Keith Chambers Guthrie|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&amp;pg|isbn=9780521294201}} p 58,59 {{ISBN|0-521-29420-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Hindu]] cosmogony which is similar to the [[Vedic]] ([[Hiranyagarbha]]) the initial state of the universe was an absolute darkness.

Hesiod made an abstraction, because his original ''chaos'' is a void, something completely indefinite. In his opinion the origin should be indefinite and indeterminate.&lt;ref&gt;O. Gigon (1968) ''Der Umsprung der Griechishe Philosophie. Von Hesiod bis Parmenides''. Bale. Stuttgart, Schwabe &amp; Co. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The indefiniteness is spatial in early usages as in [[Homer]] (indefinite sea). A fragment from [[Xenophanes]] (6th century BC)&lt;ref&gt;&lt;DK 21 B 28&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; shows the transition from ''chaos'' to ''apeiron'': "The upper limit of earth borders on air. The lower limit reaches down to the unlimited. (i.e. the Apeiron)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The world of Parmenides|author=Karl.R.Popper|year=1998|publisher=Rootledge.New York|url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=V76PlyggwQkC&amp;pg|isbn=9780415173018}} p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Either ''apeiron'' meant the "spatial indefinite" and was implied to be indefinite in kind, or Anaximander intended it primarily 'that which is indefinite in kind' but assumed it also to be of unlimited extent and duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Presocratic Philosophers|author=G.S. Kirk, J.E. Raven and M. Schofield |year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFpd86J8PLsC&amp;pg |pages=10, 110 |isbn=978-0-521-27455-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas may have been influenced by the [[Pythagoreans]]:{{Quote|[...] for they [the Pythagoreans] plainly say that when the one had been constructed, whether out of planes or of surface or of seed or of elements which they cannot express, immediately the nearest part of the unlimited began to be drawn in and limited by the limit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philolaus]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Greek philosophy entered a high level of abstraction making ''apeiron'' the principle of all things and some scholars saw a gap  between the existing ''mythical'' and the new ''rational'' way of thought (''rationalism''). But if we follow the course, we will see that there is not such an abrupt break with the previous thought. The basic elements of nature, [[water (classical element)|water]], [[air (classical element)|air]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[earth (classical element)|earth]], which the first Greek philosophers believed that composed the world, represent in fact the mythical primordial forces. The collision of these forces produced the cosmic harmony according to the Greek cosmogony (Hesiod).&lt;ref&gt;[[Claude Mossé]] (1984) ''La Grece archaique d'Homere a Eschyle.'' Edition du Seuil. p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Anaximander noticed the mutual changes between these elements, therefore he chose something else (indefinite in kind) which could generate the others without experiencing any decay.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Phys.'' Γ5, 204b 23sq.&lt;DK 12 A 16.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a fragment attributed to his teacher Thales:&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius,&lt;DK 11 A1.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; "What is divine? What has no origin, nor end." This probably led his student to his final decision for ''apeiron'', because the divinity applied to it implies that it always existed. The notion of the temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality and Anaximander's description was in terms appropriate to this conception. This ''arche'' is called "eternal and ageless" (Hippolitus I,6,I;DK B2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|author=William Keith Chambers Guthrie|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&amp;pg=PA83 |page=83 |isbn=978-0-521-29420-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of the world==
The ''apeiron'' has generally been understood as a sort of [[Substance theory|primal chaos]]. It acts as the substratum supporting opposites such as hot and cold, wet and dry, and directed the movement of things, by which there grew up all of the host of shapes and differences which are found in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legacy of Parmenides: Eleatic Monism and Later Presocratic Thought |author= Patricia Curd |year=1998|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=77|isbn=978-0-691-01182-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2JX1ulXzogC&amp;pg=PA77}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Out of the vague and limitless body there sprang a central mass—this earth of ours—cylindrical in shape. A sphere of fire surrounded the air around the earth and had originally clung to it like the bark round a tree. When it broke, it created the sun, the moon and the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Plutarch, ''Strom.'' 2, fr.179 Sandbach &lt;DK 12 A 10.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The first animals were generated in the water.&lt;ref&gt;Aetius V 19,4 &lt;DK 12 A 30.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When they came to earth they were transmuted by the effect of the sun. The human being sprung from some other animal, which originally was similar to a fish.&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus, ''Haer.'' I 6,6 &lt;DK 12 A 11.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The blazing orbs, which have drawn off from the cold earth and water, are the temporary gods of the world clustering around the earth, which to the ancient thinker is the central figure.

==Interpretations==
In the commentary of [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] on Aristotle's ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' the following fragment is attributed direct to Anaximander:
{{Quote|Whence things have their origin, there their destruction happens as it is ordained [Greek: ''kata to chreon'' means "according to the debt"]. For they give ''justice'' and ''compensation'' to one another for their ''injustice'' according to the ordering of time.}}
This fragment remains a mystery because it can be translated in different ways. Simplicius comments that Anaximander noticed the mutual changes between the four elements (earth, air, water, fire), therefore he did not choose one of them as an origin, but something else which generates the opposites without experiencing any decay. He mentions also that Anaximander said all these in poetic terms,&lt;ref&gt;Simplicius in Phys. p. 24, 13sq.&lt;DK12a9,B1&gt;
{{Quote|Anaximander from Miletus, son of Praxiades student and descendant of Thales, said that the origin and the element of things (beings) is apeiron and he is the first who used this name for the origin (arche). He says that the origin is neither water, nor any other of the so-called elements, but something of different nature, unlimited. From it are generated the skies and the worlds which exist between them. Whence things (beings) have their origin, there their destruction happens as it is ordained. For they give justice and compensation to one another for their injustice according to the ordering of time, as he said in poetic terms. Obviously noticing the mutual changes between the four elements, he didn't demand to make one of them a subject, but something else except these. He considers that genesis takes place without any decay of this element, but with the generation of the opposites by his own movement.}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that he used the old mythical language. The Goddess ''Justice'' ([[Dike (mythology)|Dike]]), appears to keep the order.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. Cleveland and New York. p. 167–168&lt;/ref&gt; The quotation is close to the original meanings of the relevant Greek words. The word ''dike'' (justice) was probably originally derived from the boundaries of a man's land and transmits metaphorically the notion that somebody must remain in his own sphere, respecting the one of his neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. World publishing company. Cleveland and New York. p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[adikia]]'' (injustice) means that someone has operated outside of his own sphere, something that could disturb "law and order" (''[[Eunomia (goddess)|eunomia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;L. H. Jeffery (1976) ''The archaic Greece. The Greek city states 700–500 BC''. Ernest Benn Ltd. London &amp; Tonbridge. p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; In Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'' ''eunomia'' is contrasted with ''[[hubris]]'' (arrogance).&lt;ref&gt;''Homer: Odyssey.'' 17.487&lt;/ref&gt; Arrogance was considered very dangerous because it could break the balance and lead to political instability and finally to the destruction of a ''city-state''.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra ''The Greek experience''. World publishing company. Cleveland and New York. p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] (1st century BC) transmits a different quotation:
{{Quote|Everything is generated from ''apeiron'' and there its destruction happens. Infinite worlds are generated and they are destructed there again. And he says (Anaximander) why this is ''apeiron''. Because only then genesis and decay will never stop.|Aetius I 3,3&lt;Ps.Plutarch; DK 12 A14.&gt;}}
Therefore, it seems that Anaximander argued about ''apeiron'' and this is also noticed by [[Aristotle]]:
{{Quote|The belief that there is something ''apeiron'' stems from the idea that only then genesis and decay will never stop, when that from which is taken what is generated is ''apeiron''.|Aristotle, ''Physics'' 203b 18–20 &lt;DK 12 A 15.&gt;}}
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]&lt;ref&gt;F. Nietzsche (1962) ''Philosophy in the tragic age of the Greeks.''. Washington DC: Regnery, Gateway.&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that Anaximander was a pessimist and that he viewed all coming to be as an illegitimate emancipation from the eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance. In accordance to this the world of the individual definite objects should perish into the indefinite since anything definite has to eventually return to the indefinite. His ideas had a great influence on many scholars including [[Martin Heidegger]].

[[Werner Heisenberg]], noted for the creation of [[quantum mechanics]], arrived at the idea that the elementary particles are to be seen as different manifestations, different quantum states, of one and the same "primordial substance". Because of its similarity to the primordial substance hypothesized by Anaximander, his colleague [[Max Born]] called this substance ''apeiron''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bmcpsgp-Ml4C&amp;pg=PA546|title= A Cultural History of Physics|last=Simonyi|first=Károly|author-link=Károly Simonyi|date=April 7, 2012|website=Chapter 5.5.10 ''Back to the Apeiron?''|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|accessdate=December 2, 2012|via=[[Google Books]]|isbn= 9781568813295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars in other fields, e.g. [[Bertrand Russell]]&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell (1946) ''History of Western Philosophy'' NY. Simon and Schuster&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maurice Bowra]],&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. World publishing company. Cleveland and N. York. p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; didn't deny that Anaximander was the first who used the term ''apeiron'', but claimed that the mysterious fragment is dealing with the balance of opposite forces as central to reality being closer to the quotation transmitted by Simplicius.

There are also other interpretations which try to match both the previous aspects. ''Apeiron'' is an abstract, void, something that cannot be described according to the Greek pessimistic belief for death. Death indeed meant "nothingless". The dead live like shadows and there is no return to the real world. Everything generated from ''apeiron'' must return there according to the principle genesis-decay. There is a polar attraction between the opposites genesis-decay, arrogance-justice. The existence itself carries a guilt.&lt;ref&gt;O. Gigon (1968) ''Der Umsprung der Griechische Philosophie. Von Hesiod bis Parmenides''. Bale Stutgart, Schwabe &amp; Co. pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|The idea that the fact of existence by itself carries along an incurable guilt is Greek (''Theognis'' 327) and anybody claims that surpasses it, commits arrogance and therefore he becomes guilty. The first half of the 6th century is a period of great social instability in Miletus, the city state where Anaximander lives. Any attempt of excess leads to exaggerations and each exaggeration must be corrected. All these have to be paid according to the debt. The things give justice to one another with the process of time.}}
Justice has to destroy everything which is born. There is no external limit that can restrict the activities of men, except the destruction. Arrogance is an expression of the chaotic element of human existence and in a way a part of the rebounding mechanism of order, because pushing it to exertions causes destruction which is also a reestablishment.&lt;ref&gt;C. Castoriadis (2004) ''Ce qui fait la Grece 1. D'Homere a Heracklite. Seminaires 1982-1983. La creation humain II''. Edition du Seuil. p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on Greek and Western thought==
We may assume that the contradiction in the different interpretations is because Anaximander combined two different ways of thought. The first one dealing with ''apeiron'' is metaphysical (and can lead to [[monism]]), while the second one dealing with mutual changes and the balance of the opposites as central to reality is physical.&lt;ref&gt;M. O. Sullivan (1985) ''The four seasons of Greek philosophy''. Efstathiadis group. Athens. pp. 28–31 (Edition in English)&lt;/ref&gt; The same [[paradox]] existed in the Greek way of thought. The Greeks believed that each individual had unlimitable potentialities both in brain and in heart, an outlook which called a man to live at the top of his powers. But that there was a limit to his most violent ambitions, that arrogance-injustice (''hubris'' or ''adikia'') could disturb the harmony and balance. In that case justice (''[[Dike (mythology)|dike]]'') would destroy him to reestablish the order.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) The Greek experience. World publishing company. Cleveland and New York. pp. 63, 89&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas are obvious in later Greek philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;C. Castoriadis (2004) ''Ce qui fait la grece 1. D'Homere a Heraclite. Seminaires 1982–1983. La creation Humain II''. Editions du Seuil. p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philolaus]] (5th century BC) mentions that nature constituted and is organized with the world from unlimitable ({{lang-grc|ἄπειρα}} ''apeira'', plural of ''apeiron'') and limitable. Everything which exists in the world contains the unlimited (''apeiron'') and the limited.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;DK B1.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Something similar is mentioned by [[Plato]]: Nothing can exist if it doesn't contain continually and simultaneously the limited and the unlimited, the definite and the indefinite.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [[Philebus]] 16c.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some doctrines existing in Western thought, still transmit some of the original ideas: "God ordained that all men shall die", "Death is a common debt". The Greek word ''adikia'' (injustice) transmits the notion that someone has operated outside of his own sphere, without respecting the one of his neighbour. Therefore, he commits [[hubris]]. The relative English word ''arrogance'' (claim as one's own without justification; {{lang-la|arrogare}}), is very close to the original meaning of the aphorism: "Nothing in excess."

==Other pre-Socratic philosophers' ideas about ''apeiron''==
Other [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers had different theories of the ''apeiron''. For the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] (in particular, [[Philolaus]]), the universe had begun as an ''apeiron'', but at some point it inhaled the void from outside, filling the cosmos with vacuous bubbles that split the world into many different parts.  For [[Anaxagoras]], the initial ''apeiron'' had begun to rotate rapidly under the control of a godlike ''[[Nous]]'' (Mind), and the great speed of the rotation caused the universe to break up into many fragments. However, since all individual things had originated from the same ''apeiron'', all things must contain parts of all other things—for instance, a tree must also contain tiny pieces of sharks, moons, and grains of sand. This alone explains how one object can be transformed into another, since each thing already contains all other things in germ.

The '''Black Riders Liberation Party''' (BRLP) is a [[revolutionary]] [[Black Power movement|black power]] organization, based in the United States. The group claims ideological continuity with the original [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther Party for Self-Defense]] and, according to its official website, organizes gang members to "stop commiting genocide against each other and to stand up against white supremacy and capitalist oppression."&lt;ref name="Black Riders Liberation Party"&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Riders Liberation Party official website|accessdate=June 18, 2018|url=http://2servethapeople.wixsite.com/brlp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] classifies the Black Riders as a [[Black separatism|black separatist]] [[hate group]] and notes that its members hold [[Black supremacy|black supremacist]] views.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/active-black-separatist-groups&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2016/active-hate-groups-united-states-2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2017/active-hate-groups-2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Establishment===

The Black Riders Liberation Party traces its origins back to a class conducted at the Youth Training School in [[Chino, California]],&lt;ref name=Kambon&gt;Malaika Kambon, [http://sfbayview.com/2013/09/to-serve-the-people-black-riders-liberation-party-new-generation-black-panther-party-for-self-defense/ "To Serve the People: Black Riders Liberation Party, New Generation Black Panther Party for Self-Defense,"] ''San Francisco Bay View,'' Sept. 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by the [[California Youth Authority]] for prisoners in the [[California]] state penal system.&lt;ref name=Aryana&gt;Comrade Aryana, [http://www.workers.org/ww/1999/aryana1125.php "Black Riders Show Resistance is Possible,"] ''Workers World,'' [Nov. 25, 1999].&lt;/ref&gt; Among these was Mischa Culton,&lt;ref name=Aryana /&gt; an individual also using the [[pseudonym|noms de guerre]] "General T.A.C.O.," an [[acronym]] for Taking All Capitalists Out,&lt;ref name=Markus&gt;Bethania Palma Markus, [http://laist.com/2012/05/04/black_riders_liberation_party_say_t.php "Black Riders Liberation Party Says Authorities Targeted Its Headquarters After May Day Protests,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728151956/http://laist.com/2012/05/04/black_riders_liberation_party_say_t.php |date=2016-07-28 }} ''LAist,'' May 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and "Wolverine Shakur."&lt;ref name=Kilby&gt;Bill Kilby, [https://www.vice.com/read/a-new-generation-black-panther-talks-about-baltimore-and-black-america-511 "A New Generation Black Panther Talks About Baltimore and Black America,"] ''Vice,'' May 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the historic example of the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther Party for Self-Defense]], upon his release from prison in 1996 Culton sought to build a new political organization by gathering others from the predominately [[African-American]] [[ghetto]]s of [[South Central Los Angeles]] and [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]].&lt;ref name=Aryana /&gt;

The fledgling organization started by Culton was energized by a November 17, 1997 police shooting of a mentally troubled black man in the [[Jordan Downs]] housing complex in Watts, a suicidal individual who had lunged at officers with a butter knife.&lt;ref name=Aryana /&gt; The result was a vigilance program given the provocative moniker "Watch a Pig," which encouraged citizens "standing a legal distance from the pigs and making sure they don't brutalize the people," in the words of the group's "Minister of Public Relations."&lt;ref name=Aryana /&gt;

===Development===

Originally limited to [[Southern California]], in 2010 a section of the organization based in [[Oakland, California]] was initiated.&lt;ref name=Kambon /&gt;

In November 2012 the BRLP launched a [[mass organization]] called the Inter-Communal Solidarity Committee in Los Angeles, attempting to build broader support for a common program.&lt;ref name=Kambon /&gt; The new front group was inspired by the [[National Committee to Combat Fascism]] (NCCF) of the Black Panther Party, according to a representative of the organization.&lt;ref name=Kambon /&gt;

In March 2015 the BRLP decided to take advantage of the [[Gun laws in Texas|open gun carrying law]] in [[Texas]], traveling to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] to conduct an armed march to the Texas state capitol together with the [[Huey P. Newton Gun Club]].&lt;ref name=Kilby /&gt; Held in conjunction with the heavily attended [[South by Southwest]] conference, the joint march was conducted in an effort to "raise the cry for armed self-defense" by the black community, according to the marchers.&lt;ref name=Kilby /&gt;

===Ideology===

The group styles itself as an organization of "black revolutionaries" engaged in a "people's war" against a white-dominated "oppressive capitalistic system."&lt;ref name=Aryana /&gt; The group advocates on behalf of [[civil rights]] and [[social justice]] and actively seeks to end gang violence so as to "change gang mentality into revolutionary mentality."&lt;ref name=Markus /&gt;

The BRLP professes a belief in the ideas of [[revolutionary socialism]], and on [[May Day]] 2012 were part of a small and ineffectual [[general strike|"General Strike"]] effort in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=Markus /&gt; The group claimed that their May 1 participation was met with retaliation by government authorities, who are said to have burst into the home of party leader Mischa Culton two days later with automatic rifles during what was later explained as a routine "compliance check" by the [[California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation]].&lt;ref name=Markus /&gt;

The Black Riders have adopted a party manifesto known as the Black Commune program which put forward many of the demands of the original 1966 [[Ten-Point Program]], with the addition of new demands (for the proper medical care of [[AIDS]] sufferers and an end to the trade in [[crack cocaine]] in the black community).&lt;ref name=Kambon /&gt;

The group's founder and chief theoretician, Mischa Culton, has called [[Barack Obama]], the first African-American President of the United States, the "ultimate neocolonial puppet" and "the grand [[House Negro|house negro]]" and declared that the American government and political system was "designed to enslave, massacre, and genocide our people out of this country."&lt;ref name=Kilby /&gt;

Culton advocates for an autonomous, black-directed movement, encouraging sympathetic whites to fight against police abuse and the ideology of [[white supremacy]].&lt;ref name=Kilby /&gt; In a 2015 interview with [[Vice (magazine)|''Vice'']] magazine, he declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It's important that black people are allowed to define themselves and their struggle, for outsiders not to come in and co-opt or water down our righteous revolutionary rage. The main way is to ride on the pigs, to go against the pigs. You've gotta study the history of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], 'cause if you're not John Brown, you might as well get out of town."&lt;ref name=Kilby /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Programs and publications===

In addition to its "Watch a Pig" police monitoring campaign, the BRLP conducts ideological training under the slogan "Educate 2 Liberate" and maintains what it calls the "Break the Lock Prisoner Support" program.&lt;ref name=Kambon /&gt;

The BRLP launched its own newspaper in 2012, the eponymous ''Black Riders Liberation Party.''&lt;ref name=Kambon /&gt;

===In popular culture===

The group was the subject of a 2013 [[documentary film]], ''Let Um Hear Ya Coming.''&lt;ref&gt;''"Let Um Hear Ya Coming'' B.R.L.P. Documentary Film Screening," Indy Bay.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical theism is a form of [[monotheism]]. Whereas most monotheists agree that God is, at minimum, [[omniscience|all-knowing]], [[omnipotence|all-powerful]], and [[omnibenevolent|completely good]],&lt;ref&gt;Pojman and Rea, 2&lt;/ref&gt; classical theism asserts that God is both [[Immanence|immanent]] (encompassing or manifested in the material world) and simultaneously [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] (independent of the material universe); [[Divine simplicity|simple]], and having such attributes as [[Immutability (theology)|immutability]], [[impassibility]], and timelessness.&lt;ref name="Craig98"&gt;Craig, 98&lt;/ref&gt; A key concept in classical theism is that "created beings" (ie, material phenomena, whether sentient biological organisms or insentient matter) are dependent for their existence on the one supreme divine Being. Also, although God is wholly transcendent, he not only creates the material universe but also acts upon the material universe in imposing (or organizing) a Higher Order upon that material reality. This order was called by the ancient Greeks ''[[logos]]''.

Classical theism is associated with the tradition of writers like [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Plotinus]], [[Augustine]], [[Anselm of Canterbury|St. Anselm]], [[Maimonides]], [[Averroes]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref name="Craig98"/&gt;  In opposition to this tradition, there are, today, philosophers like [[Alvin Plantinga]] (who rejects divine simplicity), [[Richard Swinburne]] (who rejects divine timelessness) and [[William Lane Craig]] (who rejects both divine simplicity and timelessness),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reasonablefaith.org/divine-simplicity&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/god-time-and-eternity|title=God, Time, and Eternity - Reasonable Faith|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who can be viewed as [[Theistic Personalism|theistic personalists]]. Philosophers like [[David Bentley Hart]] have defended classical theism itself in recent times.

Classical theism was almost universal among Christian theologians prior to the twentieth century. However, some of its recent critics argue that it is taken from pre-Christian philosophers and incompatible with the occasions in the Bible that describe God as emotional or changing. In defence of classical theism's compatibility with the Bible, these passages can be read in an analogous or [[allegory|allegorical]] sense as containing poetic elements, just as many other passages have also long been read. For example, Exodus 31:18&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Exodus|31:18}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes "the finger of God", and Genesis 3:8&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Genesis|3:8}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes God as noisily walking in the garden of Eden. It is inconsistent that most Christian critics of classical theism would read these latter verses in an allegorical sense, but insist that instances which describe change or passion in God are extremely literal in meaning. Moreover, whereas critics of classical theism charge that it has infiltrated Christian theology from pre-Christian roots such as [[Neoplatonism]], in fact the term "classical theism" belies crucial differences between a traditional Christian and Neoplatonic conception of God. For example, whereas [[Arius]] followed the neo-Platonist Plotinus in asserting that God could not become a physical man, [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]] defended the doctrine of God's incarnation as the man Jesus, while nevertheless defending the immutability and impassibility of Jesus' divine nature. According to a traditional Christian understanding of the ''[[communicatio idiomatum]]'', it can be rightly said that God suffered and died on the cross, but only by virtue of the [[hypostatic union]] of the impassible divine word with Jesus' passible human soul and body.&lt;ref&gt;The Complete Ante-Nicene &amp; Nicene and Post-Nicene Church Fathers Collection. Catholic Way Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, while the [[church father]]s made sure to correct the classical theism of pagan sources where it was incompatible with Christianity, it can be argued that many of the modern Christian critics of classical theism are in fact themselves influenced by an overly uncritical adoption of trends within [[process theology]], which itself has non-Christian philosophical roots in the thought of [[Charles Hartshorne]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''Collectivist anarchism''' (also known as '''anarcho-collectivism''') is a [[revolutionary]]&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"&gt;Patsouras, Louis. 2005. ''Marx in Context''. iUniverse. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anarchism|anarchist]] doctrine that advocates the abolition of both the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]] as it instead envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves.

For the [[collectivization]] of the means of production, it was originally envisaged that workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production.&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"/&gt; Once collectivization takes place, money would be abolished to be replaced with [[labour voucher|labour notes]] and [[worker]]s' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations of voluntary membership based on job difficulty and the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market.&lt;ref name="Bakunin Mikail 1980. p. 369"&gt;Bakunin Mikail. ''Bakunin on Anarchism''. Black Rose Books. 1980. p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with [[anarcho-communism]] where wages would be abolished and where individuals would take freely from a storehouse of goods "to each according to his need". Thus notwithstanding the title, [[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s "collectivist anarchism" is seen as a blend of [[individualism]] and [[collectivism]].&lt;ref&gt;Morriss, Brian. Bakukunin: ''The Philosophy of Freedom''. Black Rose Books Ltd., 1993. p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectivist anarchism is most commonly associated with Bakunin, the [[anti-authoritarian]] sections of the [[First International]] and the early [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchist movement]].

[[Giuseppe Fanelli]] met Bakunin at [[Ischia]] in 1866.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=14}} In October 1868, Bakunin sponsored Fanelli to travel to [[Barcelona]] to share his libertarian visions and recruit revolutionists to the [[International Workingmen's Association]].{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|pp=12–15}} Fanelli's trip and the meeting he organised during his travels provided the catalyst for the [[Spanish Republican government in exile|Spanish exiles]], the largest workers' and peasants' movement in modern Spain and the largest Anarchist movement in modern Europe.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=12}} Fanelli's tour took him first to Barcelona, where he met and stayed with Elie Recluse.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=12}} Recluse and Fanelli were at odds over Recluse's friendships with Spanish republicans and Fanelli soon left Barcelona for Madrid.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=12}} Fanelli stayed in Madrid until the end of January 1869, conducting meetings to introduce Spanish workers, including [[Anselmo Lorenzo]], to the First National.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=13}} In February 1869, Fanelli left Madrid, journeying home via Barcelona.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=14}} While in Barcelona again, he met with painter [[Josep Lluís Pellicer]] and his cousin [[Rafael Farga i Pellicer|Rafael Farga Pellicer]] along with others who were to play an important role establishing the International in Barcelona{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=14}} as well as the [[International Alliance of Socialist Democracy|Alliance]] section.

In 1870, Bakunin led a failed uprising in [[Lyon]] on the principles later exemplified by the [[Paris Commune]], calling for a general uprising in response to the collapse of the French government during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], seeking to transform an imperialist conflict into social revolution. In his ''Letters to A Frenchman on the Present Crisis'', he argued for a revolutionary alliance between the working class and the peasantry, advocated a system of militias with elected officers as part of a system of self-governing communes and workplaces and argued the time was ripe for revolutionary action: {{quote|[W]e must spread our principles, not with words but with deeds, for this is the most popular, the most potent, and the most irresistible form of propaganda.&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1870/letter-frenchman.htm Letters to a Frenchman on the Present Crisis], Mikhail Bakunin, 1870&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

These ideas and corresponded strikingly closely with the program of the Paris Commune of 1871, much of which was developed by followers of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] as [[Marxism|Marxists]] were almost entirely absent from the Commune. Bakunin was a strong supporter of the Commune, which was brutally suppressed by the French government. He saw the Commune as above all a "rebellion against the State" and commended the Communards for rejecting not only the state, but also revolutionary dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1871/paris-commune.htm The Paris Commune and the Idea of the State], Mikhail Bakunin, 1871&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of powerful pamphlets, he defended the Commune and the First International against the Italian nationalist [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], thereby winning over many Italian republicans to the International and the cause of revolutionary socialism. The collectivist anarchists at first used the term "collectivism" to distinguish themselves from the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] of the followers of Proudhon and the state socialists associated with [[Karl Marx]]. Bakunin wrote that "we shall always protest against anything that may in any way resemble communism or state socialism", which Bakunin regarded as fundamentally authoritarian ("Federalism, Socialism, and Anti-Theologism", 1867).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/various/reasons-of-state.htm|title=Federalism, Socialism, Anti-Theologism by Michael Bakunin|first=Mikhail|last=Bakunin|website=marxists.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakunin's disagreements with Marx, which led to the attempt by the Marx party to expel him at the Hague Congress (see below), illustrated the growing divergence between the anti-authoritarian sections of the International, which advocated the direct revolutionary action and organization of the workers and peasants in order to abolish the state and capitalism; and the sections allied with Marx, which advocated the conquest of political power by the working class. Bakunin was "Marx’s flamboyant chief opponent" and "presciently warned against the emergence of a communist authoritarianism that would take power over working people".&lt;ref&gt;Verslius, Arthur (2005-06-20) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/jun/20/00023/ Death of the Left?], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-authoritarian majority, which included most sections of the International, created their own First International at the [[Saint-Imier|St. Imier]] [[Anarchist St. Imier International|Congress]], adopted a revolutionary anarchist program and repudiated the Hague resolutions, rescinding Bakunin's alleged expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas]] Volume One: From Anarchy to Anarchism (300CE to 1939)'', [[Robert Graham (historian)|Robert Graham]], Black Rose Books, March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bakunin accepted elements of Marx’s [[class analysis]] and theories regarding capitalism, acknowledging "Marx’s genius", he thought Marx's analysis was one-sided and that Marx's methods would compromise the social revolution. More importantly, Bakunin criticized "[[authoritarian socialism]]" (which he associated with Marxism) and the concept of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] which he adamantly refused.

The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International proclaimed at the St. Imier Congress (1872) that "the aspirations of the proletariat can have no purpose other than the establishment of an absolutely free economic organization and federation, founded upon the labour and equality of all and absolutely independent of all political government", in which each worker will have the "right to the enjoyment of the gross product of his labours and thereby the means of developing his full intellectual, material and moral powers in a collective setting". This revolutionary transformation could "only be the outcome of the spontaneous action of the proletariat itself, its trades bodies and the autonomous communes".&lt;ref name="blackrosebooks.net"&gt;[http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm No profile created for this contactAnarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Volume One |]. Black Rose Books. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar position was adopted by the Workers' Federation of the Spanish Region in 1882 as articulated by an anarchist veteran of the First International, Jose Llunas Pujols, in his essay "Collectivism".&lt;ref name="blackrosebooks.net"/&gt;

By the early 1880s, most of the European anarchist movement had adopted an anarchist communist position, advocating the abolition of wage labour and distribution according to need. Ironically, the "collectivist" label then became more commonly associated with Marxist state socialists who advocated the retention of some sort of wage system during the transition to full [[communism]]. The anarchist communist [[Peter Kropotkin]] attacked this position in his essay "The Collectivist Wages System", which was reprinted in his book ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' in 1892.

Bakunin's socialism was known as "collectivist anarchism", where "socially: it seeks the confirmation of political equality by economic equality. This is not the removal of natural individual differences, but equality in the social rights of every individual from birth; in particular, equal means of subsistence, support, education and opportunity for every child, boy or girl, until maturity and equal resources, and facilities in adulthood to create his own well-being by his own labor".&lt;ref name="Revolutionary Catechism"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1866/catechism.htm ''Revolutionary Catechism''], Mikhail Bakunin, 1866&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectivist anarchism advocates the abolition of both the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. It instead envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves. For the [[collectivization]] of the means of production, it was originally envisaged that workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production.&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"/&gt; Once collectivization takes place, money would be abolished to be replaced with [[labour voucher|labour notes]] and [[worker]]s' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations based on job difficulty and the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market.&lt;ref name="Bakunin Mikail 1980. p. 369"/&gt;

=== Critique of Marxism ===
The dispute between Mikhail Bakunin and Karl Marx highlighted the differences between [[anarchism]] and [[Marxism]]. Bakunin argued—against certain ideas of a number of Marxists—that not all revolutions need to be violent. He also strongly rejected Marx's concept of the "[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]", a concept that vanguardist socialism including Marxist–Leninism would use to justify one-party rule from above by a party representing the proletariat.&lt;ref name=GW158&gt;Woodcock, George (1962, 1975). ''Anarchism'', p. 158. Harmondsworth, England: Penguin Books. {{ISBN|0-14-020622-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bakunin insisted that revolutions must be led by the people directly while any "enlightened elite" must only exert influence by remaining "[[invisible dictatorship|invisible]]...not imposed on anyone...[and] deprived of all official rights and significance".&lt;ref name="Struggle.ws"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://struggle.ws/anarchism/writers/anarcho/anarchism/bakunindictator.html |title=Was Bakunin a secret authoritarian? |publisher=Struggle.ws |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held that the state should be immediately abolished because all forms of government eventually lead to oppression.&lt;ref name=GW158/&gt; Libertarian Marxists argue Marx used the phrase to mean the worker control at the point of production, not a party, would still be a state until society is reorganized according to socialist principles.

{{quote|They [the Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship—their dictatorship, of course—can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up.|Mikhail Bakunin, ''Statism and Anarchism''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm |title=Anarchist Theory FAQ Version 5.2 |publisher=Gmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
While both social anarchists and Marxists share the same final goal, the creation of a free, [[egalitarian]] society [[Classless society|without social classes]] and government, they strongly disagree on how to achieve this goal. Anarchists believe that the classless, stateless society should be established by the [[direct action]] of the masses, culminating in [[social revolution]]; and refuse any intermediate stage such as the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] on the basis that such a dictatorship will become a self-perpetuating fundament. For Bakunin, the fundamental contradiction is that for the Marxists "anarchism or freedom is the aim, while the state and dictatorship is the means, and so, in order to free the masses, they have first to be enslaved".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Mikhail Bakunin |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1873/statism-anarchy.htm |title=Works of Mikhail Bakunin 1873 |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Bakunin also wrote of meeting Marx in 1844: {{quote|As far as learning was concerned, Marx was, and still is, incomparably more advanced than I. I knew nothing at that time of political economy, I had not yet rid myself of my metaphysical observations... He called me a sentimental idealist and he was right; I called him a vain man, perfidious and crafty, and I also was right.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Brian Morris, Bakunin: The Philosophy of Freedom, 1993, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bakunin found Marx's economic analysis very useful and began the job of translating ''[[Das Kapital]]'' into Russian. In turn, Marx wrote of the rebels in the Dresden insurrection of 1848 that "[i]n the Russian refugee Michael Bakunin they found a capable and cool headed leader".&lt;ref&gt;New York Daily Tribune (October 2, 1852) on 'Revolution and Counter Revolution in Germany'&lt;/ref&gt; Marx wrote to [[Friedrich Engels]] of meeting Bakunin in 1864 after his escape to Siberia, saying: "On the whole he is one of the few people whom I find not to have retrogressed after 16 years, but to have developed further".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Brian Morris, Bakunin: The Philosophy of Freedom, 1993, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakunin has sometimes been called the first theorist of the "[[new class]]", meaning that a class of intellectuals and bureaucrats running the state in the name of the people or the proletariat—but in reality in their own interests alone. Bakunin argued that the "[s]tate has always been the patrimony of some privileged class: a priestly class, an aristocratic class, a bourgeois class. And finally, when all the other classes have exhausted themselves, the State then becomes the patrimony of the bureaucratic class and then falls—or, if you will, rises—to the position of a machine".

Bakunin also had a different view as compared to Marx's on the revolutionary potential of the [[lumpenproletariat]] and the [[proletariat]]. As such, "[b]oth agreed that the proletariat would play a key role, but for Marx the proletariat was the exclusive, leading revolutionary agent while Bakunin entertained the possibility that the [[peasants]] and even the lumpenproletariat (the unemployed, common criminals, etc.) could rise to the occasion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://workerscompass.org/pubs/marxism_anarchism_roberston.pdf|title="Marxism and Anarchism: The Philosophical Roots of the Marx-Bakunin Conflict – Part Two" by Ann Robertson.|website=workerscompass.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakunin "considers workers' integration in capital as destructive of more primary revolutionary forces. For Bakunin, the revolutionary archetype is found in a peasant milieu (which is presented as having longstanding insurrectionary traditions, as well as a communist archetype in its current social form—the peasant commune) and amongst educated unemployed youth, assorted marginals from all classes, brigands, robbers, the impoverished masses, and those on the margins of society who have escaped, been excluded from, or not yet subsumed in the discipline of emerging industrial work...in short, all those whom Marx sought to include in the category of the lumpenproletariat".&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/deleuze-marx-politics-nicholas-thoburn-3 Nicholas Thoburn. "The lumpenproletariat and the proletarian unnameable" in ''Deleuze, Marx and Politics''].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Statism and Anarchy.jpg|thumb|''[[Statism and Anarchy]]'' by Bakunin, Russian first print (1873)]]

=== Comparison with anarcho-communism ===
The difference between collectivist anarchism and [[anarcho-communism]] is that under the former a wage system is retained based on the amount of labor performed. Anarchist communism, like collectivist anarchism, also advocates for the socialization of production, but the distribution of goods as well. Instead of "to each according to his labor", in anarcho-communism the community would supply the subsistence requirements to each member free of charge according to the maxim "to each according to his needs".&lt;ref&gt;This paragraph sourced by Shatz, Marshall; Guess, Raymond; Skinner, Quentin. The Conquest of Bread and Other Writings. Cambridge University Press. p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectivist anarchism stresses collective ownership of productive, subsistence and distributary property while communist anarchism negates the concept of ownership in favor of usage or possession with productive means being a possession not owned by any individual or particular group. Anarcho-communists believe that subsistence, productive and distributive property should be common or social possessions while personal property should be private possessions. Collectivist anarchists agree with this, but disagree on the subject of remuneration as some collectivist anarchists, such as Mikhail Bakunin, believe in the remuneration of labor while anarcho-communists, such as [[Peter Kropotkin]], believe that such remuneration would lead to the recreation of currency and that this would need a state. It could thus be said that collectivist anarchists believe in freedom through collective ownership of production and a communal market of sorts to distribute goods and services and compensate workers in the form of remuneration. Collectivist anarchism could thus be seen as a combination of communism and mutualism.

Collectivist anarchists are not necessarily opposed to the use of currency, but some while opposing the retaining of money—propose the adoption of [[labour voucher]]s or "personal credit" (such as [[Participatory economics|participatory economists]]). Most collectivist anarchists see their philosophy as a carryover to anarcho-communist, but some see the system and the use of a labour voucher system as permanent rather than a transition. Collectivist anarchist James Guillaume argued that such a society would "guarantee the mutual use of the tools of production which are the property of each of these groups and which will by a reciprocal contract become the collective property of the whole [...] federation. In this way, the federation of groups will be able to [...] regulate the rate of production to meet the fluctuating needs of society".&lt;ref&gt;James Guillaume. ''Bakunin on Anarchism''. p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue for [[workplace autonomy]] and self-management "the workers in the various factories have not the slightest intention of handing over their hard-won control of the tools of production to a superior power calling itself the 'corporation'".&lt;ref&gt;James Guillaume. ''Bakunin on Anarchism''. p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'' compares and contrasts collectivist anarchism with anarcho-communism this way: {{quote|The major difference between collectivists and communists is over the question of "money" after a revolution. Anarcho-communists consider the abolition of money to be essential, while anarcho-collectivists consider the end of private ownership of the means of production to be the key. As Kropotkin noted, "[collectivist anarchism] express[es] a state of things in which all necessaries for production are owned in common by the labour groups and the free communes, while the ways of retribution [i.e. distribution] of labour, communist or otherwise, would be settled by each group for itself."&lt;ref&gt;''Anarchism''. p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while communism and collectivism both organise production in common via producers' associations, they differ in how the goods produced will be distributed. Communism is based on free consumption of all while collectivism is more likely to be based on the distribution of goods according to the labour contributed. However, most anarcho-collectivists think that, over time, as productivity increases and the sense of community becomes stronger, money will disappear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/secA3.html%23seca32&amp;date=2009-10-25+06:42:45 A.3 What types of anarchism are there?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Performance ==
Application of many collectivist anarchists projects have been successful&lt;ref name="libcom.org"&gt;"Workers Power and the Spanish Revolution," by Tom Wetzel, http://libcom.org/library/workers-power-and-the-spanish-revolution-tom-wetzel&lt;/ref&gt; as sources during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] noted in the Catalan region: {{quote|In distribution the collectives' co-operatives eliminated middlemen, small merchants, wholesalers, and profiteers, thus greatly reducing consumer prices. The collectives eliminated most of the parasitic elements from rural life, and would have wiped them out altogether if they were not protected by corrupt officials and by the political parties. Non-collectivised areas benefited indirectly from the lower prices as well as from free services often rendered by the collectives (laundries, cinemas, schools, barber and beauty parlours, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Anarchist Collectives]]'', p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tom Wetzel describes another collectivization: {{quote|Another industry that was totally re-organized was hair-cutting. Before July 19th, there had been 1,100 hairdressing parlors in Barcelona, most of them extremely marginal. The 5,000 assistant hairdressers were among the lowest-paid workers in Barcelona. The Generalitat had decreed a 40-hour week and 15 percent wage increase after July 19th—one of the Esquerra’s attempts to woo worker support. This spelled ruin for many hairdressing shops. A general assembly was held and it was agreed to shut down all the unprofitable shops. The 1,100 shops were replaced by a network of 235 neighborhood haircutting centers, with better equipment and lighting than the old shops. Due to the efficiencies gained, it was possible to raise wages by 40 percent. The entire network was run through assemblies of the CNT barber’s union. The former owners became members of the union.&lt;ref name="libcom.org"/&gt;}}

'''David Wulstan Myatt'''&lt;ref&gt;Some accounts give Myatt's middle name as William, such as the 1998 edition of Searchlight magazine [http://www.declarepeace.org.uk/captain/murder_inc/site/nazi.html] and Black Sun: Chapter "Nazi satanism and the new Aeon", Goodrick-Clarke, 2002. But, these accounts are seen as unreliable as the authors have allegedly never corresponded with Myatt. However, several authors did and confirm his middle name as Wulstan, namely [[George Michael|Michael, George]]. (2006) ''[[The Enemy of My Enemy]]'' and [[Jeffrey Kaplan (academic)|Kaplan, Jeffrey]]. (1998) ''[[Nation and Race]]: The Developing Euro-American Racist Subculture'', Northeastern University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|1-55553-331-0}}. Additionally, there is Myatt himself (q.v. his poetry and Greek translations).&lt;/ref&gt; (born 1950), formerly known as '''Abdul-Aziz ibn Myatt'''&lt;ref&gt;Myatt originally changed his name to Abdul-Aziz (which he has penned articles under) but has been accused that he was trying to hide his identity so on the advice of an Imaam he added the ibn Myatt so people would know who he was.{{cite web |url=http://forums.islamicawakening.com/showpost.php?p=7269&amp;postcount=9 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925103842/http://forums.islamicawakening.com/showpost.php?p=7269&amp;postcount=9 |archivedate=2008-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Abdul al-Qari''',&lt;ref&gt;R.

The counterterrorism author [[Jon B.

Myatt came to public attention in 1999, a year after his Islamic conversion, when a pamphlet he wrote many years earlier, ''A Practical Guide to Aryan Revolution'', described as a "detailed step-by-step guide for terrorist insurrection",&lt;ref name="cyberspace"&gt;Whine, Michael. ''Cyberspace: A New Medium for Communication, Command and Control by Extremists'', Studies in Conflict &amp; Terrorism, Volume 22, Issue 3.

It has also been suggested that Myatt's ''A Practical Guide to Aryan Revolution'' might have influenced the German [[National Socialist Underground]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Koehler: ''The German National Socialist Underground (NSU)'', in Jackson, Paul and Shekhovtsov, Anton (editors): ''The Post-War Anglo-American Far Right: A Special Relationship of Hate''. Palgrave Macmillan, 2014. pp. 134-135. {{ISBN|9781137396211}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/ytring/ikke-sa-ensomme-ulver-1.11026908 |accessdate=2012-09-23 |title=Ikke så ensomme ulve |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923015005/http://www.nrk.no/ytring/ikke-sa-ensomme-ulver-1.11026908 |archivedate=September 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, Myatt has written extensively about his rejection of his extremist past and about his rejection of extremism in general.

Myatt has translated works of ancient Greek literature, translated and written a commentary on the Greek text of eight tractates of the [[Corpus Hermeticum]], and written several collections of poems. He is currently translating and writing a commentary on the Greek text of the [[Gospel of John]].

==Personal life==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Dm32.jpg|right|thumb|250px|David Myatt]] --&gt;
David Wulstan Myatt grew up in [[Tanganyika_(territory)|Tanganyika]], where his father worked as a civil servant for the British government, and later in the [[Far East]], where he studied [[martial arts]].&lt;ref name=Michael142/&gt; He moved to [[England]] in 1967 to complete his schooling, and has said that he began a degree in [[physics]] but did not complete it, leaving his studies to focus on his political activism.&lt;ref name="notes1"&gt;Myatt, David. [https://www.webcitation.org/5klWRf4ZN?url=http://www.geocities.com/davidmyatt/notes1.html "Towards Identity and the Galactic Empire"]. 2009-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt; He is reported to live in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] &lt;ref&gt;''[[Sunday Mercury]]'', July 9, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''Sunday Mercury'', February 16, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and to have been married three times.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidmyatt.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/david-myatt-myngath.pdf|accessdate=2013-02-06|title=Myngath - Some Recollections of A Wyrdful and Extremist Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jeffrey Kaplan (academic)|Jeffrey Kaplan]], Myatt has undertaken "a global odyssey which took him on extended stays in the Middle East and East Asia, accompanied by studies of religions ranging from Christianity to Islam in the Western tradition and Taoism and Buddhism in the Eastern path. In the course of this [[Siddhartha (novel)|Siddhartha]]-like search for truth, Myatt sampled the life of the monastery in both its Christian and Buddhist forms."&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;Kaplan, Jeffrey (2000). ''Encyclopedia of white power: a sourcebook on the radical racist right''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, p. 216ff; p.512f&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs and career==
Political scientist [[George Michael (professor)|George Michael]] writes that Myatt has "arguably done more than any other theorist to develop a synthesis of the extreme right and Islam,"&lt;ref name=Michael142&gt;Michael, George. (2006) ''[[The Enemy of My Enemy]]: The Alarming Convergence of Militant Islam and the Extreme Right''. University Press of Kansas, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; and is "arguably England’s principal proponent of contemporary neo-Nazi ideology and theoretician of revolution."&lt;ref&gt;Michael, George. ''The New Media and the Rise of Exhortatory Terrorism.'' Strategic Studies Quarterly (USAF), Volume 7 Issue 1, Spring 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

He described Myatt as an "intriguing theorist"&lt;ref name=Michael142/&gt; whose "[[Faust]]ian quests"&lt;ref name=Michael142/&gt; not only involved studying [[Taoism]] and spending time in a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and later a [[Christianity|Christian monastery]],&lt;ref name=Michael43&gt;Michael, George. (2006) ''[[The Enemy of My Enemy]]: The Alarming Convergence of Militant Islam and the Extreme Right''. University Press of Kansas, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; but also allegedly involved exploring the [[occult]], and [[Paganism]] and what Michael calls "quasi-[[Satanism|Satanic]]" secret societies, while remaining a committed National Socialist.&lt;ref name=Michael43/&gt;

Myatt is also alleged to have been the founder of the occult group the [[Order of Nine Angles]] (ONA/O9A) or to have taken it over,&lt;ref name="blacksun"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas. ''Black Sun'', NYU Press, 2002, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; written the publicly available teachings of the ONA under the pseudonym Anton Long,&lt;ref name="ryan1"&gt;Ryan, Nick. ''Into a World of Hate''. Routledge, 2003, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; with his role being "paramount to the whole creation and existence of the ONA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://regardingdavidmyatt.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/senholt-the-sinister-tradition.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2012-09-23 |title=The Sinister Tradition |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bpiHBIrr?url=https://regardingdavidmyatt.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/senholt-the-sinister-tradition.pdf |archivedate=September 26, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Senholt, "ONA-inspired activities, led by protagonist David Myatt, managed to enter the scene of grand politics and the global 'War On Terror', because of several foiled terror plots in Europe that can be linked to Myatt's writings".&lt;ref name="Senholt_identities"&gt;Senholt, Jacob. ''Secret Identities in The Sinister Tradition'', in Per Faxneld and Jesper Petersen (eds), ''The Devil's Party: Satanism in Modernity''. Oxford University Press, 2012. {{ISBN|9780199779246}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Myatt has always denied such allegations about involvement with the ONA,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ryan2"&gt;Ryan, Nick. ''Into a World of Hate''. Routledge, 2003, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidmyatt.ws/myatt-and-the-o9a.html |accessdate=2014-04-03 |title=Myatt and the ONA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518094100/http://www.davidmyatt.ws/myatt-and-the-o9a.html |archivedate=May 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and using the pseudonym Anton Long,&lt;ref name=ethos&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidmyatt.ws/ethos-of-extremism-parts1-2-6.html |accessdate=2014-04-03 |title=The Ethos of Extremism |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304044759/http://www.davidmyatt.ws/ethos-of-extremism-parts1-2-6.html |archivedate=March 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has repeatedly challenged his accusers to provide evidence of such allegations, which so far they have failed to do.&lt;ref name="myatt_honour"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://davidmyatt.wordpress.com/a-matter-of-honour-2/|accessdate=2017-06-22|title=A Matter Of Honour}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Sieg expressed doubts regarding Myatt being Long, writing that he considered it to be "implausible and untenable based on the extent of variance in writing style, personality, and tone" between Myatt and Long's writings.&lt;ref&gt;Sieg, George. ''Angular Momentum: From Traditional to Progressive Satanism in the Order of Nine Angles.'' International Journal for the Study of New Religions, volume 4, number 2. 2013. p.257.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jeffrey Kaplan (academic)|Jeffrey Kaplan]] also suggested that Myatt and Long are separate people,&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Jeffrey. ''Religiosity and the Radical Right: Toward the Creation of a New Ethnic Identity'', in Jeffrey Kaplan and Tore Bjørgo (editors), ''Nation and Race: The Developing Euro-American Racist Subculture''. Northeastern University Press. 1998. p.115. {{ISBN|978-1-55553-331-1}}. Kaplan additionally states that the individual who used the pseudonym Anton Long was a friend of Myatt's in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;/ref&gt; as did the religious studies scholar Connell R. Monette who wrote that it was quite possible that 'Anton Long' was a pseudonym used by multiple individuals over the last 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;Monette, Connell. ''Mysticism in the 21st Century''. 2013. Sirius Academic Press. p.92. {{ISBN|978-1-940964-00-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, British anti-fascist magazine ''[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]]'' wrote that: "[Myatt] does not have the appearance of a Nazi [[Ideology|ideologue]] ... [S]porting a long ginger beard, [[J. Barbour &amp; Sons|Barbour]] jacket, cords and a tweed flat cap, he resembles an eccentric country gentleman out for a Sunday ramble. But Myatt is anything but the country [[squire]], for beneath this seemingly innocuous exterior is a man of extreme and calculated hatred. Over the past ten years, Myatt has emerged as the most ideologically driven nazi in Britain, preaching race war and terrorism [...] Myatt is believed to have been behind a 15-page document which called for race war, under the imprint [[White Wolves]]."&lt;ref name=search2000&gt;''Theoretician of Terror'', Searchlight, issue #301, July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a 2003 [[UNESCO]] conference in [[Paris]], which concerned the growth of [[anti-Semitism]], it was stated that "David Myatt, the leading hardline Nazi intellectual in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] since the 1960s [...] has converted to Islam, praises bin Laden and al Qaeda, calls the 9/11 attacks 'acts of heroism,' and urges the killing of Jews. Myatt, under the name Abdul Aziz Ibn Myatt supports suicide missions and urges young Muslims to take up Jihad. Observers warn that Myatt is a dangerous man..."&lt;ref&gt;Simon Wiesenthal Center: ''Response'', Summer 2003, Vol 24, #2&lt;/ref&gt; This view of Myatt as a radical Muslim, or [[Jihadi]],&lt;ref&gt;Myatt was described by author [[Martin Amis]] as "a fierce Jihadi". ''The Second Plane''. Jonathan Cape, 2008, p.157&lt;/ref&gt; is supported by Professor [[Robert S. Wistrich]], who writes that Myatt, when a Muslim, was a staunch advocate of "Jihad, suicide missions and killing Jews..." and also "an ardent defender of bin Laden".&lt;ref&gt;Wistrich, Robert S, ''A Lethal Obsession: Anti-Semitism from Antiquity to the Global Jihad'', Random House, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-4000-6097-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Myatt's writings justifying suicide attacks was, for several years, on the ''Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades'' (the military wing) section of the [[Hamas]] website.&lt;ref&gt;Durham, Martin. ''White Rage: The Extreme Right and American Politics''. Routledge, 2007, p.113&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, Myatt has written extensively about his rejection of both Islam&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidmyatt.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/david-myatt-myngath.pdf|accessdate=2013-02-06|title=Myngath - Some Recollections of A Wyrdful and Extremist Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his extremist past,&lt;ref name="myatt_extremism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidmyatt.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/myatt-understanding-extremism-v2.pdf|accessdate=2013-02-06|title=Understanding and Rejecting Extremism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="myatt_de_novo_caelo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidmyatt.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/myatt-de-novo-cealo.pdf|accessdate=2012-06-25|title=De Novo Caelo}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing that: "What I [...] came to understand, via pathei-mathos, was the importance - the human necessity, the virtue - of love, and how love expresses or can express the numinous in the most sublime, the most human, way. Of how extremism (of whatever political or religious or ideological kind) places some abstraction, some ideation, some notion of duty to some ideation, before a personal love, before a knowing and an appreciation of the numinous."&lt;ref name="myatt_genesis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidmyatt.info/genesis-of-my-unknowing.html |accessdate=2012-06-25 |title=Pathei-Mathos - Genesis of My Unknowing |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150718030020/http://www.davidmyatt.info/genesis-of-my-unknowing.html |archivedate=July 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to writing about Islam and National Socialism, Myatt has translated works by [[Sophocles]],&lt;ref name=Walton&gt;J.

==Political activism==
Myatt joined [[Colin Jordan]]'s [[British Movement]], a neo-Nazi group, in 1968, where he sometimes acted as Jordan's bodyguard at meetings and rallies.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas. "Hitler's Priestess: Savitri Devi, the Hindu-Aryan Myth and Neo-Nazism", NYU Press, 2000, p.215&lt;/ref&gt; Myatt would later become Leeds Branch Secretary and a member of British Movement's National Council. &lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Paul. ''Colin Jordan and Britain's Neo-Nazi Movement'', Bloomsbury Publishing, 2016, p.174. {{ISBN|9781472514592}} &lt;/ref&gt; From the 1970s until the 1990s, he remained involved with [[paramilitary]] and neo-Nazi organisations such as [[Column 88]] and [[Combat 18]],&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clark, N. (2001) pp.215-217 ''[[Black Sun (book by Goodrick-Clarke)|Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity]]''. (chapter 11 in particular)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lowles, N. (2001) ''White Riot: The Violent Story of Combat 18''. Milo Books, England; this edition 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and was imprisoned twice for violent offences in connection with his political activism.&lt;ref name=Michael142/&gt;

Myatt was the founder and first leader of the [[National Socialist Movement (1960s)|National Socialist Movement]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Arkadiusz Sołtysiak.

He also co-founded, with Eddy Morrison, the neo-Nazi organization the NDFM (National Democratic Freedom Movement) which was active in Leeds, England, in the early 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clark, N.

(2002) p.223. ''Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity''. New York University Press. {{ISBN|0814731244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the NDFM, [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]] wrote (in a polemic against NDFM co-founder Eddy Morrison): "The National Democratic Freedom Movement made little attempt to engage in serious politics but concentrated its activities mainly upon acts of violence against its opponents. [...] Before very long the NDFM had degenerated into nothing more than a criminal gang."&lt;ref&gt;''Spearhead''. April, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
See also ''David Myatt and the Occult-Fascist Axis,'' in the anti-fascist magazine ''Searchlight'', No. 241 (July 1995), pp.6–7, where it is stated that NDFM members, including Myatt, were involved in a series of violent attacks on coloured people and left-wingers.&lt;/ref&gt; Myatt, writing in his autobiography ''Myngath'', admits that during this time he did organize a small gang "whose aim was to liberate goods, [[Fence_(criminal)|fence]] them, and make some money with the initial intent of aiding our political struggle." Myatt was subsequently arrested in a raid by the Yorkshire Regional Crime Squad, and imprisoned for leading this gang.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

It is also alleged that in the early 1980s Myatt tried to establish a Nazi-occultist commune in [[Shropshire]],&lt;ref name="Observer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidmyatt.ws/biog.html |title=The Promethean Peregrinations of David Myatt |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226164830/http://www.davidmyatt.ws/biog.html |archivedate=February 26, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although Myatt denies this allegation, claiming that his aim was to establish an agrarian community solely based on the Nazi principles of [[Blood and soil|Blood and Soil]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and which project was advertised in Colin Jordan's ''Gothic Ripples'' newsletter,&lt;ref&gt;''Searchlight'', #104 (February 1984) and #106 (April 1984(&lt;/ref&gt; with Goodrick-Clark writing that "after marrying and settling in Church Stretton in Shropshire, [Myatt] attempted in 1983 to set up a rural commune within the framework of Colin Jordan's Vanguard Project for neo-nazi utopias publicized in ''Gothic Ripples''".&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clark, N. (2002) p.222. ''Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity''. New York University Press. {{ISBN|0814731244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael writes that Myatt took over the leadership of Combat 18 in 1998, when [[Charlie Sargent]], the previous leader, was jailed for murder.&lt;ref name=Michael142/&gt;

===Alleged influence on David Copeland===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Dm11.jpg|right|thumb|David Myatt]] --&gt;
In November 1997, Myatt allegedly posted a [[Racism|racist]] and [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] pamphlet he had written called ''Practical Guide to Aryan Revolution'' on a website run out of British Columbia, Canada by Bernard Klatt. The pamphlet included chapter titles such as "[[Assassination]]", "Terror Bombing", and "Racial War".&lt;ref name="Vacca, John R 2005, p.420"&gt;Vacca, John R. "Computer Forensics: Computer Crime Scene Investigation", Charles River Media, 2005, p.420 {{ISBN|1-58450-389-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Michael Whine of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, "[t]he contents provided a detailed step-by-step guide for terrorist insurrection with advice on assassination targets, rationale for bombing and sabotage campaigns, and [[rules of engagement]]."&lt;ref name="cyberspace"/&gt;

In February 1998, detectives from S012 Scotland Yard raided Myatt's home in [[Worcestershire]] and removed his computers and files. He was arrested on suspicion of incitement to murder and [[incitement to ethnic or racial hatred|incitement to racial hatred]],&lt;ref name="cyberspace"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; but the case later dropped, after a three-year investigation,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidmyatt.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/david-myatt-myngath.pdf|accessdate=2013-02-06|title=Myngath - Some Recollections of A Wyrdful and Extremist Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the evidence supplied by the Canadian authorities was not enough to secure a conviction.&lt;ref name="Vacca, John R 2005, p.420"/&gt;

It was a copy of the ''Practical Guide to Aryan Revolution'' pamphlet that, in 1999, was discovered by police in the flat of David Copeland,&lt;ref name=copsey&gt;Copsey, Nigel &amp; Worley, Matthew (2017). ''Tomorrow Belongs to Us: The British Far Right since 1967''. Routledge, 2017, {{ISBN|9781317190882}}, p.156.&lt;/ref&gt; the London nailbomber &amp;ndash; who was also a member of Myatt's National Socialist Movement &amp;ndash; and thus which allegedly influenced him to plant homemade bombs targeting immigrants in [[Brixton]], [[Brick Lane]], and inside the [[Admiral Duncan pub]] on [[Old Compton Street]] in London, frequented by the black, Asian, and gay communities respectively.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Mark Weitzman: Antisemitismus und Holocaust-Leugnung: Permanente Elemente des globalen Rechtsextremismus, in Thomas Greven: Globalisierter Rechtsextremismus?

Copeland told police he had been trying to spark a "racial war."&lt;ref name="panorama"/&gt;

Following the conviction of Copeland for murder on June 30, 2000, after a trial at the Old Bailey, one newspaper wrote of Myatt: "This is the man who shaped mind of a bomber; Cycling the lanes around Malvern, the mentor who drove David Copeland to kill [...] Riding a bicycle around his Worcestershire home town sporting a wizard-like beard and quirky dress-sense, the former monk could easily pass as a country eccentric or off-beat intellectual. But behind David Myatt's studious exterior lies a more sinister character that has been at the forefront of extreme right-wing ideology in Britain since the mid-1960s."&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Mercury'', July 9, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''BBC's'' ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'', in 1998 when Myatt was leader of the NSM, he called for "the creation of racial terror with bombs".&lt;ref
name="panorama" /&gt; Myatt is also quoted by ''Searchlight'' as having stated that "[t]he primary duty of all National Socialists is to change the world. National Socialism means revolution: the overthrow of the existing System and its replacement with a National-Socialist society. Revolution means struggle: it means war. It means certain tactics have to be employed, and a great revolutionary movement organised which is primarily composed of those prepared to fight, prepared to get their hands dirty and perhaps spill some blood".&lt;ref name=search2000/&gt;

==Conversion to Islam==
Myatt converted to [[Islam]] in 1998. He told Professor George Michael that his decision to convert began when he took a job on a farm in England. He was working long hours in the fields and felt an affinity with nature, concluding that the sense of harmony he felt had not come about by chance. He told Michael that he was also impressed by the militancy of [[Islamist]] groups, and believed that he shared common enemies with Islam, namely "the capitalist-consumer West and international finance."&lt;ref name=Michael144&gt;Michael, George.

While, initially, some critics &amp;ndash; specifically the anti-fascist ''Searchlight'' organization &amp;ndash; suggested that Myatt's conversion "may be just a political ploy to advance his own failing anti-establishment agenda",&lt;ref name="icbirmingham_midland"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100localnews/page.cfm?objectid=12645580&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50002|accessdate=2006-05-01|title=Midland Nazi turns to Islam|date=2003-02-16|author=Amardeep Bassey|publisher=Birmingham Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is now generally accepted that his conversion was genuine.&lt;ref name=Covenant&gt;Miller, Rory (2007).

According to an article in ''[[The Times]]'' published on 24 April 2006, Myatt then believed that: "The pure authentic Islam of the revival, which recognises practical jihad as a duty, is the only force that is capable of fighting and destroying the dishonour, the arrogance, the materialism of the West ... For the West, nothing is sacred, except perhaps Zionists, Zionism, the hoax of the so-called Holocaust, and the idols which the West and its lackeys worship, or pretend to worship, such as democracy...

In 2010, Myatt publicly announced that he had rejected Islam,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''Myngath - Some Recollections of the Wyrdful Life of David Myatt'', Thormynd Press, 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-557-56804-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin: ''Terrorist's Creed: Fanatical Violence and the Human Need for Meaning'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2012, p.152. {{ISBN|9780230241299}}&lt;/ref&gt; having developed his own ''[[Weltanschauung]]'',&lt;ref name="myatt_culture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="myatt_patheimathos" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidmyatt.ws/biog.html |title=The Promethean Peregrinations of David Myatt |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226164830/http://www.davidmyatt.ws/biog.html |archivedate=February 26, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; writing that "the Way of Pathei-Mathos is an ethical, an interior, a personal, a non-political, a non-interfering, a non-religious but spiritual, way of individual reflexion, individual change, and empathic living, where there is an awareness of the importance of virtues such as compassion, humility, tolerance, gentleness, and love",&lt;ref name="myatt_conspectus"&gt;[http://davidmyatt.wordpress.com/about/conspectus/ Conspectus of The Philosophy of Pathei-Mathos]&lt;/ref&gt; and that "living according to the way of pathei-mathos [...] means being compassionate or inclining toward compassion by trying to avoid causing, or contributing, to suffering".&lt;ref name="myatt_conspectus"/&gt;

=="The Numinous Way" and Pathei-Mathos==
Myatt describes ''the Numinous Way'' as "the result of a four-decade long ''pathei-mathos'' and [...] the often difficult process of acknowledging my many personal mistakes",&lt;ref name="numinous-way-myatt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidmyatt.ws/numinous-way-myatt.html |accessdate=2011-09-17 |title=The Numinous Way of David Myatt |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422004128/http://www.davidmyatt.ws/numinous-way-myatt.html |archivedate=April 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and writes that it is an apolitical, and individual, way of life,&lt;ref name="development"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidmyatt.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/myatt-recuyle-of-pathei-mathos.pdf|accessdate=2013-01-18|title= Recuyle of the Philosophy of Pathei-Mathos}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on empathy and ''[[πάθει μάθος]], ''pathei-mathos,&lt;ref name="development" /&gt; where race and the concept of the folk not only have no place&lt;ref name="race_and_folk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidmyatt.wordpress.com/race-folk-and-clan/ |accessdate=2013-01-18 |title=Race, Folk, and Clan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808162631/http://davidmyatt.wordpress.com/race-folk-and-clan/ |archivedate=August 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but are regarded as unethical abstractions.&lt;ref name="myatt_culture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="development" /&gt;

He defines ''pathei-mathos'' by saying: "The Greek term πάθει μάθος derives from the ''[[Oresteia#Agamemnon|Agamemnon]]'' of [[Aeschylus]] (written c. 458 BCE), and can be interpreted, or translated, as meaning learning from adversary, or wisdom arises from (personal) suffering; or personal experience is the genesis of true learning."&lt;ref&gt;"Pathei-Mathos The Greek term πάθει μάθος derives from The Agamemnon of Aeschylus (written c. 458 BCE), and can be interpreted, or translated, as meaning learning from adversary, or wisdom arises from (personal) suffering; or personal experience is the genesis of true learning. When understood in its Aeschylean context, it implies that for we human beings pathei-mathos possesses a numinous, a living, authority. That is, the understanding that arises from one’s own personal experience – from formative experiences that involve some hardship, some grief, some personal suffering – is often or could be more valuable to us (more alive, more relevant, more meaningful) than any doctrine, than any religious faith, than any words/advice one might hear from someone else or read in some book. Thus, pathei-mathos, like empathy, offers we human beings a certain conscious understanding, a knowing; and, when combined, pathei-mathos and empathy are or can be a guide to wisdom, to a particular conscious knowledge concerning our own nature (our physis), our relation to Nature, and our relation to other human beings, leading to an appreciation of the numinous and an appreciation of virtues such as humility and εὐταξία." https://web.archive.org/web/20160228123422/https://perceiverations.wordpress.com/about-2/some-terms-explained/&lt;/ref&gt; Pathei-Mathos is thus an aspect of or element in ''the Numinous Way'', although the former term comes to predominate over the latter in Myatt's writings beginning 2012.

Myatt writes that "the numinous sympathy – συμπάθεια (sympatheia, benignity) – with another living being that empathy provides naturally inclines us to treat other living beings as we ourselves would wish to be treated: with fairness, compassion, honour, and dignity. It also inclines us not to judge those whom we do not know; those beyond the purveu – beyond the range of – our faculty of empathy".&lt;ref name="conspectus"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://davidmyatt.wordpress.com/2012/12/07/summary-of-the-philosophy-of-pathei-mathos/ |title=Summary of the Philosophy of Pathei-Mathos |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160228123312/https://davidmyatt.wordpress.com/2012/12/07/summary-of-the-philosophy-of-pathei-mathos/ |archivedate=February 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myatt links his ''Numinous Way'' to Hellenistic philosophy and places it in the Western philosophical tradition.&lt;ref name="myatt_culture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidmyatt.wordpress.com/about/development-of-the-numinous-way/|accessdate=2013-01-18|title=The Development of The Numinous Way }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="myatt_patheimathos" /&gt;

'''Democratized transactional giving''' is a form of corporate philanthropy and the latest evolution in [[cause marketing]], (defined as when for-profit companies join forces with nonprofits to promote a cause) where consumers, and not the brand in question, have maximum control over the causes they choose to support. Augmenting traditional corporate philanthropy and participatory cause marketing, democratized transactional giving empowers consumers to become better brand and cause advocates while promoting a strong behavioral influence that seeks to yield greater loyalty and brand commitment.

Successful democratized transactional giving is the outgrowth or result of a fully realized [[cause-related loyalty marketing]] campaign which not only links [[nonprofits]] and for-profits together, but does so in the context of an existing company’s [[loyalty program]]. The result is that consumers can convert any unused rewards issued by the company in the form of points, miles or other units to causes and nonprofits of their own choosing.

== Difference from traditional corporate philanthropy ==
According to KULA Causes, Inc., of Boulder, Colorado, which in 2010 designed and launched the Cause-Related Loyalty Marketing (CLM) software solution for companies looking to improve their loyalty and philanthropic efforts, corporate philanthropy/cause marketing has evolved in three phases.

Phase one was an autocratic approach where the brand selected the cause in question, the brand told the “cause story,” and the result was low customer behavioral influence. Phase two witnessed the growth of participatory cause marketing. Under this improvement, the brand still selects a number of causes (and tells the cause story) while customers choose causes from among that limited selection. The result is growing customer behavioral influence. In democratized transactional giving decisions and brand advocacy responsibility has been passed on to the consumer – a level of control that inspires a strong behavioral influence.

== Benefits for companies ==

When companies allow customers to donate unused rewards to causes of the customer’s choosing, the customer develops a greater appreciation for the company. [[Edelman]] PR found in its 2012 Goodpurpose Study that "72% of consumers would recommend a brand that supports a good cause over one that doesn’t, a 39% increase since 2008."&lt;ref&gt;Allison Goldberg, "Introducing: Goodpurpose 2012", Purpose. Edelman.com, April 25, 2102&lt;/ref&gt; By facilitating democratized transactional giving, companies can see that benefit as deepened customer loyalty.

== Benefits for consumers ==

Humans’ hard-wired capacity for [[empathy]] fuels the desire to help those in need, because people can imagine themselves in the same situation.&lt;ref&gt;Ray B. Williams, "Are We Entering the Age of Empathy?", Psychology Today, October 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers who act on this impulse benefit from the positive feelings associated with spending money on a good cause.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth W. Dunn, Daniel T. Gilbert and Timothy D. Wilson, 2011, "If money doesn't make you happy, then you probably aren't spending it right", ''Journal of Consumer Psychology'' 21, 117-118&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits for nonprofits ==

Nonprofits as a whole benefit when consumers rather than companies dictate where donations, including donations of unredeemed loyalty-program rewards, will go. This is because increasing numbers of consumers participating in democratized transactional giving also mean a wider diversity of nonprofits being helped according to each individual consumer’s cause affinities – the types of causes they tend to support.

A '''devil''' is the [[personification]] of [[evil]] as it is conceived in many and various cultures and religious traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity'' Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} pages 11 &amp; 34&lt;/ref&gt; It is seen as the objectification of a hostile and destructive force.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell. ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity’'. Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to specify a particular definition of any complexity that will cover all of the traditions, beyond that it is a manifestation of evil.  It is meaningful to consider the devil through the lens of each of the cultures and religions that have the devil as part of their mythos.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell. ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity’'. Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} p. 41-75&lt;/ref&gt; 

The history of this concept intertwines with theology, mythology, psychiatry, art and literature, maintaining a validity, and developing independently within each of the traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell. ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity.'' Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} page 44 &amp; 51&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs historically in many contexts and cultures, and is given many different names — [[Satan]], [[Lucifer]], [[Beelzebub]], [[Mephistopheles]] — and attributes: It is portrayed as blue, black, or red; It is portrayed as having horns on its head, and without horns, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Arp, Robert.

''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity'' Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} page 66&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the devil has been taken seriously often, but not always, for example when devil figures are used in advertising and on candy wrappers.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell.'' The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity’'. Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} page 41 &amp; 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Jeffrey Burton.

== Etymology ==
The Modern English word ''[[:wikt:devil|devil]]'' derives from the [[Middle English]] ''[[wikt:devel|devel]]'', from [[Old English]] ''[[wikt:deofol|dēofol]]'', that in turn represents an early Germanic borrowing of [[Latin]] ''[[:wikt:diabolus|diabolus]]''. This in turn was borrowed from {{lang-el|[[:wikt:διάβολος|διάβολος]]}} ''diábolos'', "slanderer",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddia%2Fbolos διάβολος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang|el|διαβάλλειν}} ''diabállein'', "to slander" from [[wikt:διά|διά]] ''diá'', "across, through" and βάλλειν ''bállein'', "to hurl", probably akin to the [[Sanskrit]] ''gurate'', "he lifts up".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/devil|title=Definition of DEVIL|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
In his book ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity'' [[Jeffrey Burton Russell]] discusses various meanings, and difficulties that are encountered when using the term ''Devil''.  He doesn’t claim to define the word in a general sense, but he describes the limited use that he intends for the word in his book — limited in order to “minimize this difficulty” and “for the sake of clarity”. In this book Russel uses the word ''Devil'' as "the [[personification]] of [[evil]] found in a variety of cultures", as opposed the word "[[Satan]]", which he reserves specifically for the figure in the [[Abrahamic religions]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=D2-Na937xRYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Devil:+Perceptions+of+Evil+from+Antiquity+to+Primitive+Christianity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGsLKW1qneAhVEzoMKHYZ_DXMQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Devil%3A%20Perceptions%20of%20Evil%20from%20Antiquity%20to%20Primitive%20Christianity&amp;f=false The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity]'' Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} pages 11 &amp; 34&lt;/ref&gt;

In the introduction to his book, ''Satan: A Biography'', Henry Ansgar Kelly discusses various considerations and meanings that he has encountered in using terms such as ''devil'' and ''Satan'', etc. While not offering a general definition, he describes that in his book "whenever ''diabolos'' is used as the proper name of Satan", he signals it by using "small caps."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Henry Ansgar|date=2006|title=Satan: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gPIpQg0lRbMC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=intitle:satan+inauthor:kelly#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|location=Cambridge, England|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521604024|pages=3–4|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has a variety of definitions for the meaning of "devil", supported by a range of citations: "Devil" may refer to Satan, the supreme spirit of evil, or one of the Satan's emissaries or demons that populate Hell, or to one of the spirits that possess a demonic person; "devil" may refer to one of the "malignant deities" feared and worshiped by "heathen people", a demon, a malignant being of superhuman powers; figuratively “devil" may be applied to a wicked person, or playfully to a rogue or rascal, or in empathy often accompanied by the word “poor" to a person — "poor devil".&lt;ref&gt; Craige, W. A.; Onions, C. T. A. "Devil". ''A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles: Introduction, Supplement, and Bibliography''. Oxford: Clarendon Press. (1933) p. 283-284&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==

{{Main|Apep|Set (mythology)}}
Apep ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|p|ɛ|p|,_|ˈ|ɑː|-}}) or Apophis ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|p|ə|f|ᵻ|s}}; {{lang-grc|Ἄποφις}}; also spelled Apepi or Aapep) was the [[ancient Egyptian deity]] who embodied [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]] (''[[Isfet (Egyptian mythology)|ı͗zft]]'' in Egyptian) and was thus the opponent of light and [[Ma'at]] (order/[[truth]]). He appears in [[Art of ancient Egypt|art]] as a giant serpent. His name is reconstructed by Egyptologists as *ʻAʼpāpī, as it was written ''ꜥꜣpp(y)'' and survived in later [[Coptic language|Coptic]] as {{coptic|Ⲁⲫⲱⲫ}} ''Aphōph''.&lt;ref name="Wörterbuch"&gt;[[Adolf Erman|Erman, Adolf]], and [[Hermann Grapow]], eds. 1926–1953. ''Wörterbuch der aegyptischen Sprache im Auftrage der deutschen Akademien''. 6 vols. Leipzig: J. C. Hinrichs'schen Buchhandlungen. (Reprinted Berlin: Akademie-Verlag GmbH, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

The deity Set was originally associated with both positive and negative roles: a protector of [[Ra]] on the solar boat from the Serpent of Chaos, and a [[usurper]] who killed and mutilated his brother in order to assume the throne. However, he was later [[Demonizing the enemy|demonized]] and he became quite unpopular. According to Herman te Velde, the demonization of Set took place after Egypt's conquest by several foreign nations in the [[Third Intermediate Period|Third Intermediate]] and [[Late Period of Ancient Egypt|Late Periods]]. Set, who had traditionally been the god of foreigners, thus also became associated with foreign oppressors, including the [[Assyria]]n and [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] empires. It was during this time that Set was particularly vilified, and his defeat by [[Horus]] widely celebrated. Set's negative aspects were emphasized during this period. Set was the killer of [[Osiris]], having hacked Osiris' body into pieces and dispersed it so that he could not be [[Resurrection|resurrected]]. The Greeks later linked Set with [[Typhon]] because both were evil forces, [[Weather god|storm deities]], and sons of the Earth that attacked the main gods.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Nevertheless, throughout this period, in some outlying regions of Egypt Set was still regarded as the heroic chief deity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Set has also been classed as a [[Trickster]] deity who, as a god of disorder, resorts to deception to achieve bad ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2009|title=The Trickster Revisited: Deception as a Motif in the Pentateuch|journal=Studies in Biblical Literature|volume=117|pages=16–17|author=Dean Andrew Nicholas|ISSN=1089-0645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Zoroastrianism ==
{{Main|Angra Mainyu|Dualistic cosmology}}
[[Zoroastrianism]] probably introduced the first idea of the conceptual ''devil''; a principle of evil independently existing apart from God.&lt;ref name="Russell99"&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity'' Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} page 99&lt;/ref&gt; In Zoroastrianism, good and evil derive from two ultimately opposed forces.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Hinnells ''The Zoroastrian Diaspora: Religion and Migration'' OUP Oxford 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-191-51350-3}} page 108&lt;/ref&gt; The force of good is called [[Ahura Mazda]] and the "destructive spirit" in [[Avestan language|Avestan-language]] called [[Angra Mainyu]]. The [[Middle Persian]] equivalent is [[Ahriman]]. They are in eternal struggle and neither is all-powerful, especially Angra Mainyu is limited to space and time: in the end of time, he will be finally defeated. While Ahura Mazda creates what is good, Angra Mainyu is responsible for every evil and suffering in the world, such as toads and scorpions.&lt;ref name="Russell99"/&gt;

== Buddhism ==
[[Buddhism]] contains a devil-like figure called [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; ([[Sanskrit]]: ''māra''; {{CJKV|t=魔|s=魔|p=mó}}; Tibetan Wylie: ''bdud''; {{lang-km|មារ}}; {{lang-my|မာရ်နတ်}}; {{lang-th|มาร}}; {{lang-si|මාරයා}}), who is a tempter figure in Buddhism, distracting humans from practicing the spiritual life by making mundane things alluring, or the negative seem positive. He tempted [[Gautama Buddha]] by trying to seduce him with the vision of beautiful women who, in various legends, are often said to be [[Mara (demon)#Three daughters|Mara's daughters]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 4.25, entitled, "Māra's Daughters" (Bodhi, 2000, pp. 217-20), as well as [[Suttanipata|Sn]] 835 (Saddhatissa, 1998, page 98). In each of these texts, Mara's daughters (''Māradhītā'') are personified by sensual Craving (''[[taṇhā]]''), Aversion (''arati'') and Passion (''rāga'').&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Buddhist cosmology]], Mara personifies unwholesome impulses, unskillfulness, the "death"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nirvanadhamma.com/en/articles/hidden-danger-of-existence%21/higher-realms/mara-the-god-of-death/ Mara-the god of death]&lt;/ref&gt; of the spiritual life.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

== Tengrism ==
Among the [[Tengrism|Tengristic]] myths, [[Erlik]] refers to a devil-like figure as the ruler of [[Tamag|hell]], who is also the first human. According to one narrative, Erlik and God swam together over the primordial waters. When God was about to create the earth, he send Erlik to dive into the waters and collect some mud. Erlik hid inside his mouth to later create his own world. But when God commanded earth to expand Erlik got troubled by the earth in his mouth. God aided Erlik to spit it out. The earth carried by Erlik gave place to the unpleasant areas of the world. Because of his sin, he was assigned to evil. In another cariant, the creator-god is identified with [[Ulgen]]. Again, Erlik appears to be the first human. He desired to create a human just as Ulgen did, thereupon Ulgen reacted by punishing Erlik, casting him into the underworld there he becomes its ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade ''History of Religious Ideas, Volume 3: From Muhammad to the Age of Reforms'' University of Chicago Press, 31.12.2013 {{ISBN|9780226147727}} p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Adams Leeming ''A Dictionary of Creation Myths'' Oxford University Press 2014 {{ISBN|9780195102758}} p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tengrism, there is no death by meaning that life comes to an end, it is merely a transition into the invisible world. As the ruler of hell, Erlik enslaves the souls, who are damned to hell. Further he lurks on the souls of those humans living on earth, by causing death, disease and illnesses. At time of birth, Erlik sends a [[Kormos]] to seize the soul of the new-born, following him the rest of his life in an attempt to seize his soul by hampering, misguide and injure him. When Erlik succeeds in destroying the a humans body, the Kormos sent by Erlik will try take him down into the underworld. However a good soul will be brought to paradise, by a ''Yayutshi'' sent by Ulgen.&lt;ref&gt;Plantagenet Publishing ''The Cambridge Medieval History Series volumes 1-5'' &lt;/ref&gt; Some shamans also made sacrifices to Erlik, for gaining a higher rank in the underworld, if they should be damned to hell.

== Yazidism ==
According to [[Yazidism]] there is no entity that represents evil in opposition to God; such [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] is rejected by Yazidis,&lt;ref&gt;Birgül Açikyildiz ''The Yezidis: The History of a Community, Culture and Religion'' I.B.Tauris 2014 {{ISBN|978-0-857-72061-0}} page 74&lt;/ref&gt; and evil is regarded as non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;Wadie Jwaideh ''The Kurdish National Movement: Its Origins and Development'' Syracuse University Press 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-815-63093-7}} page 20&lt;/ref&gt; Yazidis adhere to strict monism and are prohibited from uttering the word "devil" and from speaking of anything related to [[hell]].&lt;ref&gt;Florin Curta, Andrew Holt ''Great Events in Religion: An Encyclopedia of Pivotal Events in Religious History [3 volumes]'' ABC-CLIO 2016 {{ISBN|978-1-610-69566-4}} page 513&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judaism ==
{{Further|Satan#Judaism}}
[[Yahweh]], the god in pre-exilic [[Judaism]], created both good and evil, as stated in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 45:7: "I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things." The Devil did not exist in early Jewish scriptures. However, the influence of [[Zoroastrianism]] during the [[Achaemenid Empire]] introduced evil as a separate principle into the Jewish belief-system, which gradually externalized the opposition until the Hebrew term ''satan'' developed into a specific type of supernatural entity, changing the monistic view of Judaism into a dualistic one.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity'' Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN| 978-0-801-49409-3}} page 58&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Rabbinic Judaism]] rejected{{when?|date=October 2018}} the [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah) | Enochian books]] (written during the [[Second Temple period]] under [[Persians|Persian]] influence), which depicted the Devil as an independent force of evil besides God.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, David R.

Christianity identifies the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]] with the [[Serpents in the Bible|serpent]] who tempted [[Adam and Eve]] to eat the [[forbidden fruit]], and describes him as a [[fallen angel]] who terrorizes the world through evil,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; is the [[antithesis]] of [[God|Truth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/devil|title=Definition of DEVIL|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shall be condemned, together with the fallen angels who follow him, to eternal fire at the [[Last Judgement]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In mainstream [[Christianity]] the devil is usually referred to as [[Satan]]. Some modern Christians {{Who|date=April 2016}} consider the devil to be an [[angel]] who, along with one-third of the angelic host (the demons) rebelled against [[God]] and has consequently been condemned to the [[Lake of Fire]]. He is described {{Attribution needed|date=April 2016}} as hating all humanity (or more accurately creation), opposing God, spreading lies and wreaking havoc on their souls.

Satan is often identified {{by whom|date=April 2016}} as the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] who convinced [[Eve]] to eat the [[forbidden fruit]]; thus, Satan has often been depicted as a serpent. Although this identification is not present in the [[Adam and Eve]] narrative, this interpretation goes back at least as far as the time of the writing of the [[Book of Revelation]], which specifically identifies Satan as being the serpent (Rev. 20:2).

In the [[Bible]], the devil is identified with "the dragon" and "the old serpent" in the [[Book of Revelation]] 12:9, 20:2 have also been identified with Satan, as has "the prince of this world" in the [[Gospel of John]] 12:31, 14:30; and "the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience" in the [[Epistle to the Ephesians]] 2:2; and "the god of this world" in [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians|2 Corinthians]] 4:4.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|2:2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also identified as the dragon in the [[Book of Revelation]] (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#Chapter 12|Rev. 12:9]]&lt;/ref&gt;), and the tempter of the [[Gospels]] (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#Chapter 4|Mat. 4:1]]&lt;/ref&gt;).

The devil is sometimes called [[Lucifer]], particularly when describing him as an angel before his fall, although the reference in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 14:12 to Lucifer, or the Son of the Morning, is a reference to a Babylonian king.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the entries in [http://studylight.org/con/ntb/view.cgi?number=T3103 Nave's Topical Bible], the [http://studylight.org/dic/hbd/view.cgi?number=T3937 Holman Bible Dictionary] and the [http://studylight.org/com/acc/view.cgi?book=isa&amp;chapter=14&amp;verse=12#Isa14_12 Adam Clarke Commentary].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beelzebub]] is originally the name of a [[Philistines|Philistine]] god (more specifically a certain type of [[Baal]], from ''Ba‘al Zebûb'', lit. "Lord of Flies") but is also used in the New Testament as a synonym for Satan. A corrupted version, "Belzeboub", appears in [[Divine Comedy|The Divine Comedy]] (Inferno XXXIV).

In other, non-mainstream, Christian beliefs (e.g. the beliefs of the [[Devil in Christianity#Unitarians and Christadelphians|Christadelphians]]) the word "satan" in the Bible is not regarded as referring to a supernatural, personal being but to any 'adversary' and figuratively refers to human sin and temptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/devil.htm |title=Do you Believe in a Devil?

Gnostic and Gnostic influenced religions repeatedly addressed the idea, that the material world is inherently evil. The ''One true God'' is far remote, beyond the material universe, therefore this universe must be gouverned by an inferior imposter deity. This deity was identified by some sects, such as the [[Sethianism|Sethians]] or the [[Marcionism|Marcions]], with the deity of the Old testament. [[Tertullian]] accuses [[Marcion of Sinope]], that he {{quote|
[held that] the Old Testament was a scandal to the faithful … and … accounted for it by postulating [that Jehovah was] a secondary deity, a [[Demiurge|demiurgus]], who was god, in a sense, but not the supreme God; he was just, rigidly just, he had his good qualities, but he was not the good god, who was Father of Our Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;ref name="Marcion"&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Marcionites}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[John Arendzen]] (1909) in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] (1913) mentions that [[Eusebius]] accused [[Apelles (gnostic)|Apelles]], the 2nd-century AD Gnostic, of considering the Inspirer of Old-Testament prophecies to be not a god, but an evil angel.&lt;ref name="Apelles"&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Gnosticism}}&lt;/ref&gt; These writings commonly refer to the Creator of the material world as "a [[Demiurge|demiurgus]]".&lt;ref name="Marcion" /&gt; to distinguish him from the ''One true God''.

=== Catharism ===
In the 12th century in Europe the [[Catharism|Cathars]], who were rooted in [[Gnosticism]], dealt with the problem of evil, and developed ideas of dualism and demonology. The Cathars were seen as a serious potential challenge to the Catholic church of the time. The Cathars split into two camps. The first is ''absolute'' dualism, which held that evil was completely separate from the good God, and that God and the devil each had power. The second camp is ''mitigated'' dualism, which considers [[Lucifer]] to be a son of God, and a brother to Christ. To explain this they used the parable of the prodigal son, with Christ as the good soon, and Lucifer as the son that strayed into evilness. The Catholic church responded to dualism in 1215 AD in the Fourth Lateran Council, saying that God created everything from nothing, and the Devil was good when he was created, but he made himself bad by his own free will.&lt;ref&gt;Rouner, Leroy (1983).

Vroom ''Probing the Depths of Evil and Good: Multireligious Views and Case Studies'' Rodopi 2007 {{ISBN|9789042022317}} page 249&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, God allowed the Devil to seduce humanity. Evil and suffering are regarded as a test or a chance to proof confidence in God.&lt;ref&gt;Jerald D. Gort, Henry Jansen, Hendrik M. Vroom ''Probing the Depths of Evil and Good: Multireligious Views and Case Studies'' Rodopi 2007 {{ISBN|9789042022317}} page 249&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers and mystics emphasized Iblis himself as a role model of confidence in God, because God ordered the angels to prostrate themselves, Iblis was forced to choose between God's command and God's will (not to praise someone else than God). He successfully passed the test, yet his disobedience caused his punishment and therefore suffering. However, he stays patient and is rewarded in the end.&lt;ref&gt;Jerald D. Gort, Henry Jansen, Hendrik M. Vroom ''Probing the Depths of Evil and Good: Multireligious Views and Case Studies'' Rodopi 2007 {{ISBN|9789042022317}} page 254-255&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims held that the [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic]] [[Jinn]], [[Tutelary deity|tutelary deities]], became subject under [[Islam]] to the judgment of God, and that those who did not submit to the law of God are [[Shaitan|demons]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} page 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Like in Christianity, Iblis was once a pious creature of God, but later cast out of heaven, due to his pride. However, to maintain God's absolute sovereignty&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 45&lt;/ref&gt;, Islam adopts the line taken by Irenaeus, instead of the later Christian consensus, that the Devil did not rebel against God, but against humanity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell ''Lucifer: The Devil in the Middle Ages'' Cornell University Press 1986 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49429-1}} page 57&lt;/ref&gt; Further, although Iblis is generally regarded as a real bodily entity,&lt;ref&gt;Cenap Çakmak ''Islam: A Worldwide Encyclopedia [4 volumes]'' ABC-CLIO 2017 {{ISBN|978-1-610-69217-5}} page 1399&lt;/ref&gt; he plays a less significant role as the personification of evil than in Christianity. Iblis is merely a tempter, notable for inciting humans into sin by ''whispering'' into humans minds (waswās), akin to the Jewish idea of the Devil as ''[[yetzer hara]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fereshteh Ahmadi, Nader Ahmadi ''Iranian Islam: The Concept of the Individual'' Springer 1998 {{ISBN|978-0-230-37349-5}} page 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nils G. Holm ''The Human Symbolic Construction of Reality: A Psycho-Phenomenological Study'' LIT Verlag Münster 2014 {{ISBN|978-3-643-90526-0}} page 54&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, ''Shaitan'' refers unilaterally to forces of evil, including the Devil Iblis, then he causes mischief.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/shaitan&lt;/ref&gt; Shaitan is also linked to humans psychological nature, appearing in dreams, causing anger or interrupting the mental preparation for prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Cenap Çakmak ''Islam: A Worldwide Encyclopedia [4 volumes]'' ABC-CLIO 2017 {{ISBN|978-1-610-69217-5}} page 1399&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the term ''Shaitan'' also refers to beings, who follow the evil suggestions of Iblis. Furthermore, the principle of "Shaitan" is in many ways a symbol of spiritual impurity, representing humans own deficits, in contrast to a "[[Mumin|true Muslim]]", who is free from anger, lust and other devilish desires.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gauvain ''Salafi Ritual Purity: In the Presence of God'' Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|9780710313560}} page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Sufism and Mysticsm ===
{{See also|Nafs}}
In contrast to ''Occidental philosophy'', the Sufi idea of seeing "Many as One" and considering the creation in their essence as the Absolute, leads to the idea of the dissolution of any dualism between the ego substance and the "external" substinantial objects. The rebellion against God, mentioned in the Quran, takes place on the level of the [[nafs|psyche]], that must be trained and disciplined for its union with the [[Ruh|spirit]] that is pure. Since psyche drives the body, ''flesh'' is not the obstacle to human, but an unawarness that allowed the impulsive forces to cause rebellion against God on the level of the psyche. Yet, it is not a dualism between body, psyche and spirit, since the spirit embraces both psyche and corperal aspects of human.&lt;ref&gt;Fereshteh Ahmadi, Nader Ahmadi ''Iranian Islam: The Concept of the Individual'' Springer 1998 {{ISBN|978-0-230-37349-5}} page 81-82&lt;/ref&gt; Since the world is hold as the mirror in which God's attributes are reflected, participation in worldly affairs is not necessarily seen as opposed to God.&lt;ref&gt;Fereshteh Ahmadi, Nader Ahmadi ''Iranian Islam: The Concept of the Individual'' Springer 1998 {{ISBN|978-0-230-37349-5}} page 79&lt;/ref&gt; The Devil activates the selfish desires of the psyche, leading him astray from the Divine.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Kane, Bernd Radtke ''The Concept of Sainthood in Early Islamic Mysticism: Two Works by Al-Hakim Al-Tirmidhi - An Annotated Translation with Introduction'' Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|978-1-136-79309-7}} page 48&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is the  ''[[I (pronoun)|I]]'' that is regarded as evil, and both Iblis as well as [[Pharaohs in the Bible|''Pharao'']] are present as symbols for uttering "I" in ones own behavior. Therefore it is recommanded, to use the term ''I'' as rare as possible. It is only God who has the right to say "I", since it is only God, who is self-subsistent. Uttering "I" is therefore a way to compare oneselves to God, regarded as ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Awn Satan's Tragedy and Redemption: Iblis in Sufi Psychology BRILL 1983 {{ISBN|9789004069060}} p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Salafism ===

[[Salafism|Salafi]] strands of Islam commonly emphasize a [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] worldview between the believers and the unbelievers,&lt;ref&gt;Thorsten Gerald Schneiders ''Salafismus in Deutschland: Ursprünge und Gefahren einer islamisch-fundamentalistischen Bewegung'' transcript Verlag 2014 {{ISBN|9783839427118}} page p. 392 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; with the Devil as the enemy of God's path.

While in classical [[hadith]]s, the demons (''Shayateen'') and the [[jinn]] are responsible for impurity and possibly endanger people, in Salafi thought, it is the Devil himself, who lurks on the believers,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gauvain ''Salafi Ritual Purity: In the Presence of God'' Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|9780710313560}} page 68&lt;/ref&gt; always striving to lead them astray from God. The Devil is regarded as an omnipresent entity, permanently inciting humans into sin, but can be ''pushed away'' by remembering the name God.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gauvain ''Salafi Ritual Purity: In the Presence of God'' Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|9780710313560}} page 69&lt;/ref&gt; The Devil is regarded as an external entity, threatening the everyday life of the believer, even in social aspects of life.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kiefer, Jörg Hüttermann, Bacem Dziri, Rauf Ceylan, Viktoria Roth, Fabian Srowig, Andreas Zick ''„Lasset uns in shaʼa Allah ein Plan machen“: Fallgestützte Analyse der Radikalisierung einer WhatsApp-Gruppe'' Springer-Verlag 2017 {{ISBN|9783658179502}} page 111&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for example, it is the Devil, who is responsible for [[Western world|Western]] [[emancipation]].&lt;ref&gt;Janusz Biene, Christopher Daase, Julian Junk, Harald Müller ''Salafismus und Dschihadismus in Deutschland: Ursachen, Dynamiken, Handlungsempfehlungen'' Campus Verlag 2016 9783593506371 page 177 (german)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bahá'í Faith ==
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], a malevolent, superhuman entity such as a ''devil'' or ''satan'' is not believed to exist.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= satan |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 304}}&lt;/ref&gt; These terms do, however, appear in the Bahá'í writings, where they are used as metaphors for the lower nature of man. Human beings are seen to have [[free will]], and are thus able to turn towards God and develop spiritual qualities or turn away from God and become immersed in their self-centered desires. Individuals who follow the temptations of the self and do not develop spiritual virtues are often described in the Bahá'í writings with the word ''satanic''.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt; The Bahá'í writings also state that the devil is a metaphor for the "insistent self" or "lower self" which is a self-serving inclination within each individual. Those who follow their lower nature are also described as followers of "the Evil One".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Bahá'u'lláh|author2=Baháʼuʼlláh| authorlink = Bahá'u'lláh| title = Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas| url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-8.html#pg87| origyear = 1873–92| year = 1994| publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust| location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA| isbn = 0-87743-174-4| page = 87| chapter = Tablet of the World }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shoghi Effendi quoted in {{cite book| last = Hornby| first = Helen| title = Lights of Guidance: A Bahá'í Reference File| url = http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance_2&amp;chapter=4#n1738| year = 1983| publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust, New Delhi, India| isbn = 81-85091-46-3| page = 513| editor = Hornby, Helen (Ed.) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dignitas Personae''''' is the title of a 2008 [[instruction (religion)|instruction]] by the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] giving doctrinal directives on certain embryonic ethical controversies that had emerged since 1987, after ''[[Donum Vitae]]'' was released.

The document takes a critical stance against [[selective reduction]], [[prenatal diagnosis]], [[preimplantation diagnosis]], [[in vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]], [[cryopreservation]], [[embryo transfer]], some forms of [[genetic engineering]], [[embryo donation]], which have been criticized as unethical by pro-life ethicists because they provoke the termination of embryonic cell reproduction. 

The doctrinal material is not only addressed to Catholic couples, but also to pharmacists, doctors, ethicists, theologians, politicians and industrialists so that they may try to tackle these issues together. Other related documents, such as ''Humanae Vitae'', were also written for a wide variety of individuals and specialists on the matter.     

''Dignitas Personae'' also reiterates Church opposition to [[contraception]] and [[abortion]], mentioning new methods of birth control such as [[female condom]]s and the [[morning-after pill]].

The '''Doctor of Clinical Hypnotherapy''' ('''DCH''') degree is an [[educational accreditation|unaccredited]] degree in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.minnesota-institute-of-advanced-communication-skills.com/Hypnosis-Degrees-and-Schools.htm&lt;/ref&gt; One example is  Breyer State University an online unaccredited University that offers a Phd in Hypnotherapy PhD Program. The program at Breyer State University, is composed of, listening to audio tapes, online distance education, a required Dissertation, the practice of actually practicing hypnotizing subjects, interacting with other Hypnotherapy students and class professors. There are also existing hypnotherapy certification programs. Because the majority of hypnotherapy degrees are offered through programs that are unaccredited in nature, they do not have to meet any requirements established by national licensing standards.

The DCH was an unaccredited doctoral degree offered in the United States, which provided in-depth theory and training in applied clinical hypnotherapy. Individual programs offered by institutions in the US vary but generally combine distance learning with local practicum training. Because some hypnotherapy degrees are offered through programs that are unaccredited in nature, they do not have to meet any requirements established by national licensing standards. However, the American Institute of Hypnotherapy (AIH) was approved by the [[California Bureau for Private Postsecondary &amp; Vocational Education]]&lt;ref&gt;Website for the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary &amp; Vocational Education, http://www.bppe.ca.gov/&lt;/ref&gt; but a former FBI consultant, [[John Bear]], has said that there is much difference between having "approval" and "accreditation".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.ie/national-news/revealed-another-top-adviser-has-dodgy-degree-231550.html&lt;/ref&gt; The BPPVE do not accredit programs. According to the BPPVE database (as of 25 May 2010), the American Institute of Hypnotherapy is now located in [[Carmel, California]], but indicate that they no longer offer degree training in clinical hypnotherapy.

==American Institute of Hypnotherapy (AIH)==

Originally approved by the State of California to grant degrees in early 1980s, the American Institute of Hypnotherapy offered unaccredited bachelors and doctorate degrees in clinical hypnotherapy which served a way point as there were no accredited programs available in the specialization at the time. AIH sought to establish hypnotherapy as a separate field. The program could be completed by distance learning and directed independent study (DIS) but required attendance at seminars, practicals, workshops, studying a range of relevant texts and developing a 20-30 page academic paper on each course/text. These were graded by faculty for content and analysis of the topic. The program modeled a Psy.D program, offering the opportunity to study many diverse authors, researchers and applications in hypnosis including pain control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthrestoration.ie/american_institute_of_hypnothera.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012232712/http://www.healthrestoration.ie/american_institute_of_hypnothera.htm |archivedate=2011-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer concerns==
Accredited doctorate degrees in mental health, such as [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], [[Doctor of Psychology|Psy.D.]], and [[Doctor of Education|Ed.D.]], are tightly controlled by state and federal laws. The D.C.H. degree is largely unregulated. There is a growing concern among these professionals that hypnotists are misleading consumers.&lt;ref&gt;http://mentalhealth.about.com/cs/psychotherapy/a/initials.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Some have illegally attempted to offer psychotherapy under generic titles such as "doctor" or "psychotherapist", without proper training or background.

==Hypnotherapy training==
There are several professional membership organizations in the United States that require minimum standards in specialized hypnotherapy education to become members as well as certified as a hypnotherapist (C.Ht.).&lt;ref&gt;[[Hypnotherapy]]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these organizations certify vocational hypnotherapists, and do not require health care training or experience for certification. Four of these professional membership organizations in the U.S. are The [[National Guild of Hypnotists]], the [[American Board of Clinical Hypnotherapy]], The American Counsel of Hypnotist Examiners (A.C.H.E) and [[International Medical and Dental Hypnotherapy Association]] (IMDHA). These are educational membership organizations dedicated to standards and practice efforts in understanding and extending applications in hypnotherapy. In addition, the [[Hypnosis Society of Pennsylvania]] has a process of recognition of training programs in conjunction with the Hypnotist Union as a [[Service Employee Union]] credential in the USA. Other good organizations with high standards in the field of hypnosis and hypnotherapy include The National Association for Transpersonal Psychology, The International Association of Counselors and Therapists and the American Association of Hypnotic Anesthesiology. All above-mentioned organizations are excellent vocational certifying agencies with high standards for membership to their associations.

However, the [[American Society of Clinical Hypnosis]] (ASCH) has long claimed to be the "gold-standard" of organizations which train and certify health care professionals in the art of hypnotherapy. Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, psychologists, etc.) with a master's degree or higher can receive certification through a rigorous application process and training.While A.S.C.H, has a high standard of training in clinical applications of hypnosis, it largely accommodates certification for professionals already in other field of the healing and helping professions. The hypnotherapy training itself, in general holds no more requirements than those required by other less "official" certifying bodies.  The [[National Board for Certified Clinical Hypnotherapists]], also offers a certifications for healthcare professionals with rigorous requirements for such recognition it is another organization that certifies mental health and medical professionals who meet the rigorous qualifications of the board, have advanced degrees from accredited colleges or universities and are licensed to practice in their respective states. But again, these rigorous requirements have less to do with the demand for excellence of education in hypnosis, over other more vocational certifying agencies and more to do with the applicants already obtained past academic achievements. The vocational requirements for hynotherapuetic certifications are set  no lower over all in of training in hypnosis standards than those of other well known The ASCH, BCCH or similar certifying boards. Within the community of hypnotherapists, hypnosis and hypnotherapy are seen as a unique and specialized field, a  profession in its own right independent to other professions.To the average hypnotherapist, though medical men, psychologists, counselors and others may unitize hypnosis as a part of what they do in their own profession, they only employ hypnosis as one of several tools and are not experts since they do not specialize in clinical hypnosis, but rather uses the modality in conjunction with their field of clinical expertise.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.natboard.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Some Doctorate degrees in the past have also been conferred by various certifying bodies and schools based on minimum requirements of 300 hours or more classroom hours, 100 hours externships under the guidance of clinical hypnotherapist's already well established and life experience as a practicing hypnotherapist. Some hypnotherapists who have met these requirements have been conferred doctorate degrees based on years of clinical experience and practice in the field. The College of Medical and Dental Hypnotherapy in the USA is one such school that used to confer a Doctorate in this manner, Though, at present it is no longer offered, its last official conferred degree being in the year 2004.

The Hypnosis Motivation Institute (HMI), based in [[Tarzana, California]], is a nationally, not regionally, accredited college dedicated exclusively to teaching hypnosis and hypnotic techniques.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hypnosis.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; {{better source|date=June 2016}} HMI offers both local classes on its campus in Tarzana, as well as a comprehensive distance learning based program. HMI is accredited by the Accrediting Council for Continuing Education and Training (ACCET) and the Distance Education and Training Council (DETC) (both accrediting agencies recognized by the U.S. Department of Education) and is approved by the California Board of Behavioral Sciences (BBS), the Dental Board of California (DBC) and the California Board of Registered Nursing (BRN) to provide continuing education credits for ongoing licensing requirements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6756">The '''Electronic Retailing Self-Regulation Program''' ('''ERSP''') is a self-regulatory program created in 2004 by American business organizations to promote consumer confidence. ERSP is a program of the Electronic Retailing Association http://www.retailing.org in conjunction with the [[National Advertising Review Council]] (NARC) and administered by the Council of [[Better Business Bureaus]]. The mission of the program is to enhance consumer confidence in electronic retailing, by providing a forum to self-regulate [[direct response advertising]].

ERSP was created for several reasons, to: improve consumer confidence in electronic retailing; demonstrate the strong commitment of this industry to effective self-regulation; provide a quick and efficient mechanism for review of high-profile [[advertising]] (such as weight-loss advertising) and affecting the discontinuance of advertising containing egregious claims. ERSP investigates the truth and accuracy of claims in direct response advertising from inquiries brought to ERSP’s attention through competitor’s challenges, consumer’s concerns, or through ERSP’s ongoing monitoring program. Working as a voluntary program, ERSP is an efficient and useful tool to assist direct response marketers with timely and cost effective measures to minimize government interference and increase consumer confidence. 

The direct response industry includes long-form ([[infomercial]]) productions, short-form [[commercials]], live home [[shopping channels]], print advertising, Internet marketing, cell phone advertising, [[broadband]] channels, and radio advertising. Anything that has a direct link to the marketer: either a 1-[[800 number]], [[email]], or [[website]] is within ERSP’s purview.

ERSP inquires about the evidentiary support that a marketer possesses for product claims communicated through any form of direct-response advertising. Advertising claims come to ERSP’s attention through competitive challenges and ERSP’s ongoing monitoring program. 

Among the most significant benefits afforded by this program are:&lt;br&gt;
• '''speed''' – the ERSP mandate is to resolve all inquiries within 60 calendar days&lt;br&gt;
• '''cost''' –low cost alternative to litigation &lt;br&gt;
• '''burden of proof''' – ERSP does not require that injury to a consumer be proven as may be required by law and&lt;br&gt; 
• '''confidentiality''' – a company may bring cases anonymously to ERSP and, conversely, any proprietary information submitted confidentially will remain so in an ERSP challenge.&lt;br&gt;
 
The 60-day structure of this program is vital in limiting marketer inconvenience, but comprehensive enough to provide a thorough review. The success of the program lies in the voluntary participation by direct response marketers and the nature of the self-regulatory format. With the beneficial nature of this format for the electronic retailing industry, ERSP looks forward to not only continuing its monitoring program but to addressing the challenges brought by both consumers and competitors of electronic marketing.

Core claims at issue in an ERSP inquiry might include:

• Establishment Claims (“Clinically proven”)&lt;br&gt;
• Performance Claims (how well a product performs)&lt;br&gt;
• Testimonials (Anecdotal tales from consumers about their results with the product)&lt;br&gt;
• Weight Loss Claims&lt;br&gt;
• Health and Safety&lt;br&gt;
• Disclosures&lt;br&gt;
• Before and After Photographs&lt;br&gt;
• Puffery&lt;br&gt;
• Comparative Claims

ERSP opened its first case in August 2004.

== How the ERSP Process Works ==

ERSP details its concerns in an initial letter of inquiry and the marketer is given 15 calendar days to respond to ERSP with substantiation for the issues raised. ERSP then has 15 calendar days to ask the marketer for more information regarding its submission. Upon receipt of that request the marketer has 10 days to answer ERSP’s questions, and upon receipt of that, ERSP has 15 calendar days to reach a decision. 

If a marketer does not respond to the initial inquiry letter by ERSP, a press release summarizing the claims at issue and announcing a 10-calendar-day response for the marketer is released.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:ERSP5.jpg]] --&gt;

== ERSP Determinations – What to Expect ==

Participants in an ERSP review can anticipate one of three results:

• ERSP determines that the core claims at issue are supported by reasonable evidence. &lt;br&gt;
• ERSP recommends the marketer modify core claims.&lt;br&gt;
• ERSP determines there is no support for the claims at issue and recommends that the advertiser pull the advertisement.

ERSP also refers marketers to the appropriate [[regulatory agency]] if they fail to respond or refuse to comply with ERSP’s findings. Compliance inquiries are also conducted to confirm compliance with ERSP recommendations.&lt;br&gt;

== ERSP Review Program ==
In January 2012, the Electronic Retailing Self-Regulation Program (ERSP) expanded its purview to monitor and review advertising of the coaching and mentoring and live seminar industry. The program is called the “ERSP Review Program.”  The ERSP Review Program has two fundamental components: 1) review of telemarketing practices and free live seminar events which include telesales phone calls,  scripts and recordings of free, live seminar events ; 2) monitoring of lead generation advertising applicable to the coaching and mentoring industry including print, broadcast and online advertising.

== ERSP Copy Review ==
In 2014 ERSP introduced its Copy Reviewservice which is offered to members of the direct response industry and provides a review of advertising and the reasonable messages being communicated in the advertisement (usually conducted before the advertising is nationally disseminated). The review is focused on the legal, regulatory, self-regulatory and/or statutory provisions that should be considered and/or adhered to with respect to representations (express or implied) disseminated in an advertisement. Unlike a preclearance service which entails a comprehensive review of a marketer’s substantiation, a copy review evaluation is a “''non evidentiary''” review and is limited to “''primary''” and “''core''” claims communicated in an advertisement. Consumer complaints can be sent into ERSP via this [http://savvyshopper.org/savvyshopper/complaintlog/complaint_frame.htm complaint form].&lt;br&gt;

'''Elme Marie Caro''' (4 March 1826, [[Poitiers]], [[Vienne]] – 13 July 1887, [[Paris]]) was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]].

==Life==
His father, a professor of philosophy, gave him an education at the [[Collège Stanislas de Paris|Stanislas College]] and the [[École Normale]], where he graduated in 1848. After being professor of philosophy at several provincial universities, he received the degree of doctor, and came to Paris in 1858 as master of conferences at the École Normale.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1861, he became inspector of the [[Academy of Paris]], in 1864 professor of philosophy to the Faculty of Letters, and in 1874 a member of the [[Académie française]]. 
He married [[Pauline Cassin]], the author of the ''Pêche de Madeleine'' and other well-known novels.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In his philosophy, he was mainly concerned to defend [[Christianity]] against modern [[Positivism]]. The philosophy of [[Victor Cousin]] influenced him strongly, but his strength lay in exposition and criticism rather than in original thought.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Besides important contributions to ''La France'' and the ''[[Revue des deux mondes]]'', he wrote ''Du mysticisme au XVIII&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle'' (1852–1854), ''L'Idée de Dieu'' (1864), ''Le Matérialisme et la science'' (1868), ''Le Pessimisme au XIX&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle'' (1878), ''Jours d'épreuve'' (1872), ''M. Littré et le positivisme'' (1883), ''[[George Sand]]'' (1887), ''Mélanges et portraits'' (i888), ''La Philosophie de Goethe'' (2nd ed., 1880).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4976">[[File:Emanuel Rádl.jpg|thumb|Emanuel Rádl]]
'''Emanuel Rádl''' (December 21, 1873 &amp;ndash; May 12, 1942) was an original [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[biologist]], [[History of science|historian of science]], [[philosophy|philosopher]] and a critical supporter of [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk|Masaryk´s]] pre-war democratic [[Czechoslovakia]]. He earned international renown by his works on the evolution of neural system and as historian of evolution theories.

== Life and thought ==
One of five children of a village merchant's family in [[Pyšely]] (35&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Prague]]), Rádl studied biology at [[Charles University]] in Prague, where he became assistant professor in 1904 and full professor in 1919. He worked on the [[neural system]] of [[insects]], on [[phototropism]] and on the evolution of [[visual perception|sight]]. Influenced by the German biologist and philosopher [[Hans Driesch]], he became interested in [[vitalism|philosophy of life]] and in a large work ''The History of Biological Theories'' (in German 1905&amp;ndash;1909, in English 1930; reprint in 1988) he criticized the [[evolutionism]] of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann&amp;ndash;Markoš (eds.). ''Emanuel Rádl''. Praha 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; At the book's climax at the end of Chapter 33, Rádl dismisses Darwinism with the words

{{quote|We may therefore sum up the modern position in Driesch's words: 'For those with insight Darwinism has been dead for a long time'... Darwinism as a tyrannic doctrine, which imperiously enchains the minds of men, is dead.|Rádl, ''The History of Biological Theories'', 1930. p. 388}}

Under the influence of Masaryk he inclined more and more towards philosophical questions, became a critic of scientific [[positivism]] and after the establishment of [[Czechoslovakia]] (1918) a public critic of several contemporary tendencies he considered dangerous. He wrote books on Czech and German [[nationalism]], on [[social justice]], on the fundamental differences between the West and the East and very early against the misuse of [[racial theories]] and against [[antisemitism]]. Together with the Protestant theologian J. L. Hromádka he co-founded the Czech Academic [[YMCA]] and published numerous booklets on various public topics. In 1934 he presided the 8th International Congress of Philosophy in Prague, but after 1935 he was gradually excluded from public life by a serious illness. He died in 1942 in Prague during the German occupation in almost complete isolation. His posthumous book ''Consolation from Philosophy'', in the oppressive mood of war, is a highly personal profession of faith in the lasting values of truth and religion and evoked a lively discussion after its publication in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Patočka]], ''Věčnost a dějinnost''. Praha 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"How to save our civilization from decay? This is the desperate question of our time, the more desperate that no one feels the danger."&lt;ref&gt;E. Rádl, ''Útěcha z filosofie''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8515">An '''Enlightenment Intensive''' is a group [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreat]] designed to enable a [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|spiritual enlightenment experience]] within a relatively short time.

Religious teachings and philosophical concepts are generally avoided.

== Origins ==
Charles Berner (1927 – 2007), who was later known as,  Yogeshwar Muni, created the Enlightenment Intensive.  In the 1960s he formed the Institute of Ability where he and his wife Ava promoted “holistic health techniques such as fasting and massage, communication exercises like those used in encounter groups, emotional release therapies, past life regression, and a host of other modalities popular among the 1960’s counterculture.” &lt;ref&gt;Faulds, R;(2009){{ISBN|0974410675}};Peaceable Kingdom Books;&lt;/ref&gt;

Berner was known for his skills in helping people improve their life.  He taught that honest communication and understanding between one’s self and others was the path to improved relationships, enlightenment and fulfilling the purpose of Life.&lt;ref&gt;Berner,C.;(2015)Relating and Spiritual Consciousness;{{ISBN|1518696287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Berner had observed that those who were most identified with their self-image, ego or personality tended not to make much progress in personal therapy, which may require flexibility.

Mystics who practise insight or [[jnana yoga]] report a momentary change of [[consciousness]] bringing a direct experience of the [[reality]] or truth of [[self (spirituality)|self]] or of others, or of existence, such as is known in various traditions as [[kensho]], [[satori]] or [[samadhi]]. But traditional techniques for this realisation depend upon a monastic or [[eremitic]] life difficult to attain for the average Westerner.

In spring 1968 it "just suddenly occurred" to Charles Berner - "what source it came from I know not but it wasn't a process of sitting down and figuring it out"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Noyes, L. (1998), ''The Enlightenment Intensive: Dyad Communication (created by his wife Ava Berner) as a Tool for Self-Realization''. North Atlantic Books. ({{ISBN|1883319730}})&lt;/ref&gt; - to combine meditation methods with the structure of an interpersonal workshop.

The first experimental Enlightenment Intensive was held soon afterwards in the Californian desert with Charles and Ava Berner. Bill Savoie, in an unpublished book, The Bridge to One, writes that “in May 1968 Charles announced we would have a 5 day Enlightenment Intensive. We would just go for it and see what would happen. Charles had a community of about 150 people who would stay connected with his teachings. At that first Enlightenment Intensive there were 26 people. Both Peggy and I were there."&lt;ref&gt;Berner, C; Enlightenment and the Enlightenment Intensive:Volume 2;(2014);{{ISBN|978-1492263289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“The Enlightenment Intensive retreat that Berner created in 1968 grew out of his interest and research with using interpersonal communication to facilitate the enlightened state and personal growth.  Berner wondered if there were more effective ways to accelerate spiritual development and personal growth for his students and clients.” &lt;ref&gt;Berner,C.;(2015)Relating and Spiritual Consciousness;{{ISBN|1518696287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berner combined “the 10,000 year old self inquiry meditation, ‘Who Am I,’ with a 20th Century western communication technique developed by Ava Berner called the relating dyad.  The result that Berner and his students discovered was that this combination increased consciousness and quickened the process of enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Berner,C.;(2015)Relating and Spiritual Consciousness;{{ISBN|1518696287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Presentation is the technique used by us,” writes Berner in a booklet titled, Enlightenment.  “By continual interaction with another, by presenting continually to another the results of contemplation of the nature of one’s self, the process of enlightenment is accelerated.  One maintains his state of increased consciousness because it is achieved while in contact with another, and so one is in Life and the enlightenment is useful.”(5) This was a major discovery in the history enlightenment techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Berner,C.;(2015)Relating and Spiritual Consciousness;{{ISBN|1518696287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berner ran dozens over the next few years, gradually refining the format and method, optimising the retreat for the "weekend truth-seeker". He also trained others to lead groups. His 99th and last Enlightenment Intensive was held in Berkeley in 1975.

== Structure ==
The typical intensive is three days long: there are also longer Enlightenment Intensives (e.g., seven days, two weeks, six weeks) using essentially the  same format as a three-day. It is led by a "master" or "facilitator" whose role is to set up the retreat, ensure it runs smoothly and provide participants with information, support and encouragement, both as a whole and individually. It has a set of rules designed to ensure a single-minded focus on the purpose of the retreat.

A typical day starts early in the morning and lasts until late in the evening and usually consists of a single structure interspersed with eating, washing, exercise, work and meditation. Each day there are ten to twelve 40-minute periods where participants work in dyads, rotating partners, giving an instruction, chosen by the participant or the master/facilitator, often called a ''[[koan]]''. The most usual instructions are "tell me who you are", tell me what you are", "tell me what life is" or "tell me what another is".

One partner gives the instruction to the other and listens intently without any response. The "talking" partner looks for a direct experiential answer and reports it to their partner. This continues for 5 minutes when, in response to a bell or chime, the "talking" partner becomes the "listening" partner for 5 minutes. After 40 minutes there is a break before resuming with another partner.

When participants have a direct experience of great clarity they may present an answer to the master/facilitator. The participant then continues, either with another instruction or the same instruction.

There may be a period on the last day to support integration of the experience into daily life. There may also be a follow-up meeting after some days.

==Influence==
Enlightenment Intensives are now held in many countries around the world. They may be offered as a "stand-alone" process outside any tradition, movement or organization. There are also numerous derivative processes going by different names, perhaps involving some alteration of the format.

{{Nihongo|'''Fukusai-ji'''|福済寺}} is an [[Ōbaku]] [[Zen]] temple in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Nagasaki prefecture|Nagasaki]], [[Japan]].  Its honorary ''[[Buddhist temples in Japan#sangō|sangō]]'' prefix is {{nihongo|''Bunshizan''|分紫山}}. Founded in 1628 and later destroyed in 1945, Fukusai-ji has since been reconstructed in the shape of a turtle with an 18-metre high [[aluminium alloy]] statue of [[Kannon]], the [[Bodhisattva]] of compassion. The interior is famous for the 25-metre [[Foucault Pendulum]] which swings over the remains of 16,500 Japanese killed during [[World War II]].

'''Girolamo Manfredi''' or '''Hieronimus de Manfredis''' (1430 - 1493) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[philosopher]], [[physician]] and [[astronomer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://thesaurus.cerl.org/cgi-bin/record.pl?rid=cnp01236801|title= Manfredi, Girolamo (1430 - 1493) in CERL Thesaurus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived and worked in Bologna, becoming a notable citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/655293?journalCode=rq|title= Review of "Mai sotto Saturno: Girolamo Manfredi, medico e astrologo" by Tommaso Duranti | doi=10.1086/655293 | volume=63|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|pages=643–644 | last1 = Azzolini | first1 = Monica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Born in [[Bologna]] in a family of lawyers, he led his studies in his hometown, in [[Ferrara]] where he graduated in 1455, and in [[Parma]] where he completed his Ph.D. He taught [[Logic]] and other disciplines in Bologna for the rest of his life.

He entered the [[minor orders]] and he had the [[tonsure]] in 1459.&lt;ref name="DBI"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/girolamo-manfredi_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title= MANFREDI, Girolamo. Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 68 (2007). By Anna Laura Trombetti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He disputed with [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] and worked together with [[Cola Montano]] and [[Galeotto Marzio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://books.google.it/books?id=faOmE4MXVlMC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;lpg=PA181&amp;dq=Girolamo+Manfredi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=m6Jk0HCYQY&amp;sig=VkGp6W4GnJU5RiOOzuZ9wsnVRHg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI8Ja_0L3VAhVJKMAKHbBJAOs4FBDoAQgzMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Girolamo%20Manfredi&amp;f=false|title= Notizie degli scrittori bolognesi, raccolte da Giovanni Fantuzzi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manfredi died in Bologna during the summer of 1493.&lt;ref name="DBI" /&gt;

He wrote his works both in latin and [[Vulgar Latin|vernacular]]. His most acclaimed book is ''Liber de homine (Il Perché)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fupress.net/index.php/mes/article/viewFile/9770/9075|title= Girolamo Manfredi’s Il Perché.

'''Helsinki Finite-State Technology''' ('''HFST''') is a computer programming [[Library (computing)|library]] and set of utilities for natural language processing with [[finite-state machine|finite-state]] automata and [[finite-state transducer]]s. It is [[free and open-source software]], released under a mix of the [[GNU General Public License]] version 3 (GPLv3) and the [[Apache License]].

==Features==
The library functions as an interchanging interface to multiple backends, such as OpenFST, [[Foma (software)|foma]] and SFST. The utilities comprise various compilers, such as hfst-twolc (a compiler for morphological two-level rules),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/~koskenni/esslli-2001-karttunen/&lt;/ref&gt; hfst-lexc (a compiler for lexicon definitions) and hfst-regexp2fst (a regular expression compiler). Functions from [[Xerox]]'s proprietary scripting language xfst is duplicated in hfst-xfst, and the pattern matching utility pmatch in hfst-pmatch, which goes beyond the finite-state formalism in having [[recursive transition network]]s (RTNs).

The library and utilities are written in [[C++]], with an interface to the library in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and a utility for looking up results from transducers ported to [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and Python.

Transducers in HFST may incorporate [[Finite-state transducer#Weighted automata|weights]] depending on the backend. For performing FST operations, this is currently only possible via the OpenFST backend. HFST provides two ''native'' backends, one designed for fast lookup (''hfst-optimized-lookup''), the other for format interchange. Both of them can be weighted.

==Uses==
HFST has been used for writing various linguistic tools, such as spell-checkers, hyphenators, and morphologies.&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/flammie/omorfi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://giellatekno.uit.no/doc/infra/infraremake/HowToConfigureAndOptimiseSpellers.html&lt;/ref&gt; Morphological dictionaries written in other formalisms have also been converted to HFST's formats.&lt;ref&gt;https://sourceforge.net/projects/hfst/files/resources/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hugh Everett III''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|v|ər|ɪ|t}}; November 11, 1930 – July 19, 1982) was an American [[physicist]] who first proposed the [[many-worlds interpretation]] (MWI) of [[quantum physics]], which he termed his "relative state" formulation.

Discouraged by the scorn&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=hugh-everett-biography "The Many Worlds of Hugh Everett"] by Peter Byrne, from ''Scientific American'', December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; of other physicists for MWI, Everett ended his physics career after completing his Ph.D. Afterwards, he developed the use of generalized [[Lagrange multipliers]] for [[operations research]] and applied this commercially as a defense analyst and a [[consultant]]. He was married to Nancy Everett née Gore. They had two children: Elizabeth Everett and [[Mark Oliver Everett]], who became frontman of the musical band [[Eels (band)|Eels]].

== Early life and education ==
Born in 1930, Everett was born and raised in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area. Everett's parents separated when he was young.  Initially raised by his mother (Katherine Lucille Everett née Kennedy), he was raised by his father (Hugh Everett Jr) and stepmother (Sarah Everett née Thrift) from the age of seven.&lt;ref name="MAD"/&gt;

Everett won a half scholarship to [[St. John's College High School]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]  From there, he moved to the nearby [[The Catholic University of America|Catholic University of America]] to study [[chemical engineering]] as an undergraduate.  While there, he read about [[Dianetics]] in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]''.  Although he never exhibited any interest in [[Scientology]] (as Dianetics became), he did retain a distrust of conventional medicine throughout his life.&lt;ref name="MAD"/&gt;

During [[World War II]] his father was away fighting in Europe as a [[Lieutenant Colonel|lieutenant colonel]] on the general staff.  After [[World War II]], Everett's father was stationed in [[West Germany]], and Hugh joined him, during 1949, taking a year out from his undergraduate studies. Father and son were both keen photographers and took hundreds of pictures of [[West Germany]] being rebuilt. Reflecting their technical interests, the pictures were "almost devoid of people".&lt;ref name="MAD"/&gt;

==Princeton==
Everett graduated from the Catholic University of America in 1953 with a degree in chemical engineering, although he had completed sufficient courses for a [[mathematics]] degree as well. He received a [[National Science Foundation]] fellowship that allowed him to attend [[Princeton University]] for graduate studies. He started his studies at Princeton in the mathematics department, where he worked on the then-new field of [[game theory]] under [[Albert W. Tucker]], but slowly drifted into physics. In 1953 he started taking his first physics courses, notably Introductory Quantum Mechanics with [[Robert Dicke]].&lt;ref name="MAD"/&gt;

During 1954, he attended Methods of Mathematical Physics with [[Eugene Wigner]], although he remained active with mathematics and presented a paper on military game theory in December. He passed his general examinations in the spring of 1955, thereby gaining his [[master's degree]], and then started work on his dissertation that would (much) later make him famous. He switched thesis advisor to [[John Archibald Wheeler]] some time in 1955, wrote a couple of short papers on [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and completed his long paper, ''Wave Mechanics Without Probability'' in April 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Fabio Freitas, ''Os estados relativos de Hugh Everett III: uma análise histórica e conceitual.'' Programa de Pós-Graducação em Ensino, Filosofia e História das Ciências. 2007 {{cite web |url=http://www.ppgefhc.ufba.br/dissertacoes/freitas2004.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218094638/http://www.ppgefhc.ufba.br/dissertacoes/freitas2004.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his third year at Princeton, Everett moved into an apartment which he shared with three friends he had made during his first year, [[Hale Trotter]], Harvey Arnold&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvey J. Arnold, Obituary|year=2013|url=http://www.stubbsconner.com/obituaries/Harvey-Arnold/#!/Obituary}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles Misner]].  Arnold later described Everett as follows: {{Quote|He was smart in a very broad way. I mean, to go from chemical engineering to mathematics to physics and spending most of the time buried in a science fiction book, I mean, this is talent.&lt;ref name=MAD/&gt;}} It was during this time that he met Nancy Gore, who typed up his ''Wave Mechanics Without Probability'' paper. Everett married Nancy Gore the next year.&lt;ref name="grandchildren"&gt;[[Mark Oliver Everett]], ''Things the Grandchildren Should Know'', {{ISBN|978-0-316-02787-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eugene"&gt;Eugene Shikhovtsev, ''Biographical Sketch of Hugh Everett, III'', [http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/everett/everett.html Eugene Shikhovtsev's Biography of Everett, maintained by [[Max Tegmark]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The long paper was later retitled as ''The Theory of the [[Universal wavefunction|Universal Wave Function]]''.

Wheeler himself had traveled to Copenhagen in May 1956 with the goal of getting a favorable reception for at least part of Everett's work, but in vain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Olival Freire, Jr.]]: ''Science and exile: David Bohm, the hot times of the Cold War, and his struggle for a new interpretation of quantum mechanics'' [https://arxiv.org/ftp/physics/papers/0508/0508184.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olival Freire Jr.: ''Science and exile: David Bohm, the Cold War, and a new interpretation of quantum mechanics'' {{cite web|url=http://www.controversia.fis.ufba.br/index_arquivos/Freire-Bohm-HSPS.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326192406/http://www.controversia.fis.ufba.br/index_arquivos/Freire-Bohm-HSPS.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1956 Everett started defense work in the Pentagon's [[Weapons Systems Evaluation Group]], returning briefly to Princeton to defend his thesis after some delay in the spring of 1957.  A short article, which was a compromise between Everett and Wheeler about how to present the concept and almost identical to the final version of his thesis, was published in ''[[Reviews of Modern Physics]]'' Vol 29 #3 454-462, (July 1957), accompanied by an approving review by Wheeler.  Everett was not happy with the final form of the article.&lt;ref name=MAD/&gt;

==After Princeton==
[[File:Hugh Everett at New Mexico 1956 course attedence certicate.jpg|320px|thumb|right|Everett's attendance marked the transition from academia to commercial work.]]

Upon graduation in September 1956, Everett was invited to join the Pentagon's newly-forming [[Weapons Systems Evaluation Group]] (WSEG), managed by the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]]. Between 23–26 October 1956 he attended a weapons orientation course managed by [[Sandia National Laboratories]] at [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] to learn about [[nuclear weapon]]s and became a fan of computer modeling while there. In 1957, he became director of the WSEG's Department of Physical and Mathematical Sciences. After a brief intermission to defend his thesis on quantum theory at Princeton, Everett returned to WSEG and recommenced his research, much of which, but by no means all, remains classified. He worked on various studies of the [[Minuteman missile]] project, which was then starting, as well as the influential study ''The Distribution and Effects of Fallout in Large Nuclear Weapon Campaigns''.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Everett III and George E.Pugh, "The Distribution and Effects of Fallout in Large Nuclear-Weapon Campaigns", in ''Biological and Environment Effects of Nuclear War'', Hearings Before the Special Sub-Committee on Radiation of the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy, June 22–26, 1959, Washington, D.C., U.S. Government Printing Office, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1962/pauling-lecture.html Dr. Linus Pauling Nobel Peace Prize 1962 lecture] (and reprinted in ''Peace'' by Frederick W. Haberman, Irwin Abrams, Tore Frängsmyr, Nobelstiftelsen, Nobelstiftelsen (Stockholm), published by World Scientific, 1997 {{ISBN|981-02-3416-3}}), delivered on December 11, 1963, in which he mentioned the work by Pugh and Everett regarding the risks of nuclear profliferation and even quoted them from 1959. Pauling said: "This is a small nuclear attack made with use of about one percent of the existing weapons. A major nuclear war might well see a total of 30,000 megatons, one-tenth of the estimated stockpiles, delivered and exploded over the populated regions of the United States, the Soviet Union, and the other major European countries. The studies of Hugh Everett and George E. Pugh [21], of the Weapons Systems Evaluation Division, Institute of Defense Analysis, Washington, D.C., reported in the 1959 Hearings before the Special Subcommittee on Radiation, permit us to make an estimate of the casualties of such a war. This estimate is that sixty days after the day on which the war was waged, 720 million of the 800 million people in these countries would be dead, sixty million would be alive but severely injured, and there would be twenty million other survivors. The fate of the living is suggested by the following statement by Everett and Pugh: 'Finally, it must be pointed out that the total casualties at sixty days may not be indicative of the ultimate casualties. Such delayed effects as the disorganization of society, disruption of communications, extinction of livestock, genetic damage, and the slow development of radiation poisoning from the ingestion of radioactive materials may significantly increase the ultimate toll.' ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

During March and April 1959, at Wheeler's request, Everett visited [[Copenhagen]], on vacation with his wife and baby daughter, in order to meet with [[Niels Bohr]], the "father of the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]". The visit was a complete disaster; Everett was unable to communicate the main idea that the universe is describable, in theory, by an objectively existing universal wave function (which does not "collapse"); this was simply heresy to Bohr and the others at Copenhagen. The conceptual gulf between their positions was too wide to allow any meeting of minds; [[Léon Rosenfeld]], one of Bohr's devotees, talking about Everett's visit, described Everett as being "undescribably [sic] stupid and could not understand the simplest things in quantum mechanics". Everett later described this experience as "hell...doomed from the beginning".&lt;ref name="Heresy"/&gt;

However, whilst in Copenhagen, in his hotel, he started work on a new idea to use generalized [[Lagrange multipliers]] for [[mathematical optimization]]. Everett's theorem, published in 1963, relates the [[duality (optimization)|Lagrangian bidual]] to the primal problem.&lt;ref name="Lagrange"/&gt;

In 1962 Everett accepted an invitation to present the relative-state formulation (as it was still called) at a conference on the foundations of quantum mechanics held at [[Xavier University]] in Cincinnati.&lt;ref name="Heresy"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Osnaghi | first1 = Stefano | last2 = Freitas | first2 = Fabio | last3 = Olival Freire | first3 = Jr | year = 2009 | title = The Origin of the Everettian Heresy | url = http://stefano.osnaghi.free.fr/Everett.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics | volume = 40 | issue = 2| pages = 97–123 | doi = 10.1016/j.shpsb.2008.10.002 | bibcode = 2009SHPMP..40...97O }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his exposition Everett presented his derivation of probability and also stated explicitly that observers in all branches of the wavefunction were equally "real." He also agreed with an observation from the floor that the number of branches of the universal wavefunction was an [[uncountable infinity]].&lt;ref name="Heresy"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Osnaghi | first1 = Stefano | last2 = Freitas | first2 = Fabio | last3 = Olival Freire | first3 = Jr | year = 2009 | title = The Origin of the Everettian Heresy | url = http://stefano.osnaghi.free.fr/Everett.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics | volume = 40 | issue = 2| pages = 97–123 | doi = 10.1016/j.shpsb.2008.10.002 | bibcode = 2009SHPMP..40...97O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1964, Everett and several WSEG colleagues started Lambda Corp. to apply military modeling solutions to various civilian problems. During the early 1970s, defense budgets were curtailed and most money went to operational duties in the [[Vietnam War]], resulting in Lambda eventually being absorbed by the General Research Corp.

In 1973, Everett and Donald Reisler (a Lambda colleague and fellow physicist) left the firm to establish DBS Corporation in [[Arlington, Virginia]]. Although the company researched [[United States Navy]] ship maintenance optimization and weapons applications, it "specialized in analyzing the socioeconomic effects of government [[affirmative action]] programs" as a contractor under the auspices of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and the [[Department of Health, Education and Welfare]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hugh-everett-biography/&lt;/ref&gt; For a period of time, the company was partially supported by [[American Management Systems]], a business consulting firm that drew upon algorithms developed by Everett. He concurrently held a non-administrative vice presidency at AMS and was frequently consulted by the firm's founders. 

Everett cultivated an early aptitude for [[computer programming]] at IDA and favored the [[TRS-80]] at DBS, where he primarily worked for the rest of his life.

== Later recognition ==
In 1970 [[Bryce DeWitt]] wrote an article for ''[[Physics Today]]'' on Everett's relative-state theory, which evoked a number of letters from physicists.  These letters, and DeWitt's responses to the technical objections raised, were also published.  Meanwhile DeWitt, who had corresponded with Everett on the many-worlds / relative state interpretation when originally published in 1957, started editing an anthology on the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.  In addition to the original articles by Everett and Wheeler, the anthology was dominated by the inclusion of Everett's 1956 paper ''The Theory of the [[Universal Wavefunction]]'', which had never been published before.  The book was published late in 1973, sold out completely, and it was not long before an article on Everett's work appeared in the [[science fiction]] magazine, ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]''.&lt;ref name="Heresy"/&gt;

In 1977, Everett was invited to give a talk at a conference Wheeler had organised at Wheeler's new location at the [[University of Texas at Austin]].  As with the Copenhagen visit, Everett vacationed from his defense work and traveled with his family.  Everett met DeWitt there for the first and only time.  Everett's talk was quite well received and influenced a number of physicists in the audience,&lt;ref name="Heresy"/&gt; including Wheeler’s graduate student, [[David Deutsch]], who later promoted the many-worlds interpretation to a wider audience.&lt;ref name="Heresy"/&gt;  Everett, who "never wavered in his belief in his many-worlds theory",&lt;ref name="newsciMark"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Aldhous| first = Peter| title = Parallel lives can never touch| magazine = New Scientist| issue = 2631|date=2007-11-24| url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19626311.800-interview-parallel-lives-can-never-touch.html| accessdate = 2007-11-21| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  enjoyed the presentation; it was the first time for years he had talked about his quantum work in public.  Wheeler started the process of returning Everett to a physics career by establishing a new research institute in California, but nothing came of this proposal.  Wheeler, although happy to introduce Everett's ideas to a wider audience, was not happy to have his own name associated with Everett's ideas.  Eventually, after Everett's death, he formally renounced the theory.&lt;ref name="Heresy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gardner|first= Martin|authorlink= Martin Gardner|title= Are Universes Thicker Than Blackberries?|date=July 2003|publisher= [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]|location= New York|isbn= 0-393-05742-9|chapter= Multiverses and Blackberries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and legacy ==

At the age of 51, Everett died suddenly of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at home&lt;ref name="grandchildren"/&gt; in his bed on the night of July 18–19, 1982. Everett's obesity, frequent [[chain-smoking]] and alcohol drinking&lt;ref name="grandchildren"/&gt; almost certainly contributed to this, although he seemed healthy at the time. A committed atheist,&lt;ref name="MAD"/&gt; he had asked that his remains be disposed of in the trash after his death. His wife kept his ashes in an urn for a few years, before complying with his wishes.&lt;ref name="MAD"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Byrne|title=The Many Worlds of Hugh Everett III: Multiple Universes, Mutual Assured Destruction, and the Meltdown of a Nuclear Family|isbn=978-0-19-955227-6|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2010|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About Hugh's death his son, [[Mark Oliver Everett]], later said: {{quote|I think about how angry I was that my dad didn't take better care of himself.  How he never went to a doctor, let himself become grossly overweight, smoked three packs a day, drank like a fish and never exercised.  But then I think about how his colleague mentioned that, days before dying, my dad had said he lived a good life and that he was satisfied.  I realize that there is a certain value in my father's way of life.  He ate, smoked and drank as he pleased, and one day he just suddenly and quickly died.  Given some of the other choices I'd witnessed, it turns out that enjoying yourself and then dying quickly is not such a hard way to go.&lt;ref&gt;''Things the Grandchildren Should Know'', {{ISBN|978-0-316-02787-8}}, pg 235&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Of the companies Everett initiated, only Monowave Corporation still exists (in [[Seattle]] as of March 2015). It is managed by co-founder Elaine Tsiang, who received a Ph.D. in physics under [[Bryce DeWitt]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] before working for DBS as a programmer.

Everett's daughter, Elizabeth, committed suicide in 1996 (saying in her suicide note that she wished her ashes to be thrown out with the garbage so that she might "end up in the correct parallel universe to meet up w[ith] Daddy"),&lt;ref name="MAD" /&gt; and in 1998, his wife, Nancy, died of cancer. Everett's son, [[Mark Oliver Everett]], who found Everett dead, is also known as "E" and is the main singer and songwriter for the band [[Eels (band)|Eels]]. The Eels album ''[[Electro-Shock Blues]]'', which was written during this time period, is representative of these deaths. 

Mark explored his father's work in the hour-long BBC television documentary ''[[Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/tv/2007/11/last_nights_tv_parallel_worlds.html Last night's TV: Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives], Nancy Banks-Smith, Guardian blog, 27 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bandweblogs.com/blog/2007/11/16/parallel-worlds-parallel-lives-bbc-four-documentary-about-eels-founder-mark-everett-and-his-father/ Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives BBC Four documentary about Eels founder Mark Everett and his father] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214084339/http://www.bandweblogs.com/blog/2007/11/16/parallel-worlds-parallel-lives-bbc-four-documentary-about-eels-founder-mark-everett-and-his-father/ |date=2008-02-14 }}, Band Weblogs, 16 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/tv/wk48/mon.shtml#mon_parallelworlds "][[Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives]]", BBC Press Release&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008d2zj "Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives"], BBC iPlayer&lt;/ref&gt; The program was edited and shown on the [[Public Broadcasting Service]]'s [[Nova (TV series)|Nova]] series in the USA during October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/manyworlds/ Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives"], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] [[Nova (TV series)|Nova]] TV program, October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Healy, Pat, [http://www.readmetro.com/show/en/Boston/20081021/1/26/ "‘Nova’ came for his soul: Eels front man on the healing power of a science doc about his dad"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715161722/http://www.readmetro.com/show/en/Boston/20081021/1/26/ |date=2011-07-15 }}, [[Metro International|Metro newspaper]], October 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=hugh-everett-new-film-tackles-many-2008-10-21 Hugh Everett: New film tackles "many worlds" theory of quantum mechanics] 60 second science, Scientific American blog, by Jordan Lite and George Musser&lt;/ref&gt;

In the program, Mark mentions how he wasn't aware of his fathers' status as a brilliant and influential physicist until his death in 1982.

'''''In the Shadow of the Silent Majorities, Or, the End of the Social''''' ({{lang-fr|À l’ombre des majorités silencieuses ou la fin du social}}) is a 1978 [[Philosophy|philosophical]] [[treatise]] by [[Jean Baudrillard]], in which he analyzes the [[mass society|masses]] and their relation to meaning.  The masses are presented as the ideal form of resistance to the social.&lt;ref name=Anarchist&gt;{{cite web |url = http://anarchistnews.org/content/university-social-death-and-inside-joke |title = The University, Social Death and the Inside Joke |publisher = Anarchist News |author = worker |date = 18 February 2010 |accessdate = 12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication history ==

The first edition of the book was published in the final issue of the magazine ''Les Cahiers d'Utopie'' in 1978.&lt;ref name=Tonka&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sens-tonka.net/lombre-majorites-silencieuses-ou-fin-social |title = À l'ombre des majorités silencieuses ou la fin du social |publisher = Sens &amp; Tonka &amp; Cie |date = 15 February 2005 |language = french |accessdate = 12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Violeau&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.after1968.org/app/webroot/uploads/JB%2068%20Utopie%20-%20JLVioleau.doc |title = Jean Baudrillard, 68 et la fonction utopique |publisher = After 1968 |author = Jean-Louis Violeau |language = french |accessdate = 12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated to English by Paul Foss, John Johnston and Paul Patton, and published by the Foreign Agents imprint of [[Semiotext(e)]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=Congress1&gt;{{cite web |url = https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=9234&amp;recCount=25&amp;recPointer=1&amp;bibId=12895179 |title = In the shadow of the silent majorities, Or, the end of the social, and other essays |publisher = Library of Congress Online Catalog |accessdate = 12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second edition was published in 2007.&lt;ref name=Congress2&gt;{{cite web |url = https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=9250&amp;recCount=25&amp;recPointer=0&amp;bibId=14959642 |title = In the shadow of the silent majorities, Or, the end of the social, and other essays |publisher = Library of Congress Online Catalog |accessdate = 12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main ideas ==

In the 1970s, magazines such as ''Utopie'', ''Noir et rouge'', ''ICO'', ''Socialisme ou Barbarie'', ''Pouvoir ouvrier'', and the [[Situationist International|Situationists]] were unconditionally opposed to the official culture. They saw the masses as hypnotized into submission by a "[[The Society of the Spectacle|society of the spectacle]]." However, Baudrillard interpreted the passivity of the masses in a different way.&lt;ref name=Violeau /&gt;

The work starts with the idea that meaning has been devalued. "For a long time, capital had only to produce goods; consumption ran by itself... Today it is necessary to produce consumers, to produce demand, and this production is infinitely more costly than that of goods." The same applies to meaning. "Today, everything has changed; no longer is meaning in short supply, it is produced everywhere, in ever increasing quantities – it is demand which is weakening... Everywhere the masses are encouraged to speak... They are urged to live socially, electorally, organizationally, sexually, in participation, in festival, in free speech, etc."&lt;ref name=Shadow3&gt;{{cite book |last = Baudrillard |first = Jean |date = 1983 |title = In the Shadow of the Silent Majorities |publisher = Semiotext(e) |page = 52 |isbn = 0936756004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central point of the book is that the masses actively refuse meaning. It is an explicit break with [[sociology]].&lt;ref name=Ballardian&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ballardian.com/crimes-of-the-near-future-baudrillard-ballard |title = Crimes of the Near Future: Baudrillard / Ballard |publisher = Ballardian |author = Benjamin Noys |date = 21 March 2007 |accessdate = 12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While modernity laments the ignorance of the docile masses, Baudrillard argues that the indifference of the masses to political events, history, art, and culture, is actually "a collective retaliation" and "a refusal to participate in the recommended ideals, however [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightened]]."&lt;ref name=Journal&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www2.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol4_2/v4-2-jrlindsey.html |title = Rethinking the Political: Taking Baudrillard's "Silent Majorities" Seriously |publisher = International Journal of Baudrillard Studies, Vol. 4, No. 2 |author = Jason Royce Lindsey |date = July 2007 |accessdate = 12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the masses can do - and all they will do - is enjoy the spectacle.&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;{{cite web |url = https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/shadow-silent-majorities |title = In the Shadow of the Silent Majorities, New Edition |publisher = The MIT Press |accessdate = 12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since "their representation is no longer possible,"&lt;ref name=Shadow&gt;{{cite book |last = Baudrillard |first = Jean |date = 1983 |title = In the Shadow of the Silent Majorities |publisher = Semiotext(e) |page = 20 |isbn = 0936756004}}&lt;/ref&gt; the masses are probed by means of surveys, polls, and tests. Politics is forced to rely on [[Simulacra and Simulation|simulations]] of the people as a substitute.&lt;ref name=Journal /&gt; Masses are "far too conforming to every solicitation and with a [[hyperreality|hyperreal]] conformity which is the extreme form of non-participation."&lt;ref name=Shadow2&gt;{{cite book |last = Baudrillard |first = Jean |date = 1983 |title = In the Shadow of the Silent Majorities |publisher = Semiotext(e) |page = 48 |isbn = 0936756004}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Baudrillard stated in a later interview: "People do in fact defend themselves, they have their defensive and even offensive strategies; but this time, through indifference."&lt;ref name=Block&gt;{{cite magazine |last = Williamson |first = Judith |date = 1989 |title = An Interview with Jean Baudrillard |magazine = Block}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1378">An '''invincible error''' is, in [[Christian philosophy]], a normally [[sin|sinful action]] which is not considered sinful because it was committed through blameless ignorance that one's actions were harmful or otherwise prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05525a.htm 'Error' in Catholic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the stated philosophy, a sin occurs when a person knowingly commits an evil act, meaning that they must know both:
*that they are committing the act
*that the act is evil
If a person is ignorant of one of these two facts, then the type of ignorance becomes important. If the person is intentionally or willfully ignorant, this is known as ''[[vincible ignorance]]'', and the act is still considered a sin. If, however, the person is unintentionally ignorant of one of these two key facts, then they are considered ''invincibly'' ignorant, and have committed an invincible error.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.katapi.org.uk/MoralTH/ChV.htm Elements of Moral Theology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620050432/http://katapi.org.uk/MoralTH/ChV.htm |date=2006-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Israr Ahmed''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|ڈاکٹر اسرار احمد}}}}; 26 April 1932 – 14 April 2010; MA, [[MBBS]]) was a Pakistani [[Islamic theologian]],&lt;ref name="tanzeem.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tanzeem.info/webapps/tip_dnnweb/Organization/TheFounder.aspx |title=About the Founder:Dr. Israr Ahmad |publisher=Tanzeem.org |date= |accessdate=22 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320020504/http://tanzeem.info/webapps/tip_dnnweb/Organization/TheFounder.aspx |archivedate=20 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islamic philosophy|philosopher]],&lt;ref name="Grand Strategic review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hashmi|first=Salima|title=On the Philosophy of Dr. Israr Ahmed|url=http://www.grandestrategy.com/2010/04/on-philosophy-of-dr-israr-ahmed.html|publisher=Grand Strategic review|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Islamic scholar]]&lt;ref name="Dawn Archives, April 15th, 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Our Staff Reporter|title=Prominent scholar Dr Israr Ahmed dies|url=http://archives.dawn.com/archives/43760|accessdate=15 March 2013|newspaper=Dawn Archives, 15 April 2010|date=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was followed particularly in South Asia as well as by South Asian Muslims in the Middle East, Western Europe, and North America.&lt;ref name="Dr.IA"&gt;[http://islam.islamabad.net/ islamabad.net, "Dr. Israr Ahmed"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329114424/http://islam.islamabad.net/ |date=29 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the founder of the [[Tanzeem-e-Islami]] and an offshoot activist of the rightist [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]].&lt;ref name="Dawn Archives, April 15th, 2010"/&gt; Ahmed wrote and published 60 books on different aspects of Islam and religion, nine of which were translated into English.&lt;ref name="Dawn Archives, April 15th, 2010"/&gt;

==Early life and education==

Israr Ahmed was born in [[Hisar (city)|Hisar]], a province of [[Punjab Province (British India)|East Punjab]] of [[British Indian Empire]], on 26 April 1932.&lt;ref name="Peace TV promotion"&gt;{{cite web|last=Peace TV|title=Dr. Israr Ahmad|url=http://www.peacetv.tv/en-gb/speakers/dr-israr-ahmed|publisher=Peace TV promotion|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a [[Indian Civil Service|civil servant]] in the [[British Government]]&lt;ref name="Peace TV promotion"/&gt; who relocated his family from Hisar to [[Montgomery (Pakistan)|Montgomery]], now [[Sahiwal]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab Province]] of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="tanzeem.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peace TV promotion"/&gt;

After graduating from a local high school, Ahmed moved to [[Lahore]] to attend the [[King Edward Medical University]] in 1950.&lt;ref name="Dawn Archives, April 15th, 2010"/&gt; He received his [[MBBS]] from [[King Edward Medical University]] in 1954 and began practising medicine.&lt;ref name="Dawn Archives, April 15th, 2010"/&gt;

In 1950, he joined [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] led by [[Abul Ala Maududi]], but left the party when the latter opted for participating in electoral politics in 1957. Ahmed resigned from the Jamaat-e-Islami in April 1957 because of its involvement in [[Politics of Pakistan|national politics]], which he believed was irreconcilable with the revolutionary methodology adopted by the Jama'at in the pre-1947 period.&lt;ref name="Dr.IA"/&gt; His interest in Islam and philosophy grew further and he subsequently moved to [[Karachi]], [[Sindh Province]] in the 1960s where he enrolled in [[Karachi University]]. After submitting his thesis in 1965, he earned his MA degree in [[Islamic Studies]] from Karachi University.&lt;ref name="Dawn Archives, April 15th, 2010"/&gt;

==Work==

===Literature and philosophy===

In 1967, Ahmed wrote and published the important philosophy book, ''Islamic Renaissance: The Real Task Ahead'', in which he briefly explained the abstract idea of the [[caliphate]] system. He maintained that only by revitalising [[Iman (concept)|Iman]] and importance of faith among the Muslims in general and intelligentsia in particular.{{Citation needed|date= January 2018}} His solution was to teach Qur'an in contemporary idiom backed by the highest level of scholarship. Commenting on scientific aspects, Ahmed wrote that "this undertaking would remove the existing dichotomy between modern physical and social sciences on the one hand, and Islamic revealed knowledge on the other."{{Citation needed|date= January 2018}}

He criticised modern democracy and the prevalent electoral system and argued that the head of an Islamic state could reject the majority decisions of an elected assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Mumtaz Ahmad, "Media-Based Preachers and the Creation of New Muslim Publics in Pakistan," NBR Special Report 22, February 2010 [http://nbr.org/publications/specialreport/pdf/SR22.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmed was awarded the [[Sitara-i-Imtiaz]] in 1981. He has authored over 60 books in Urdu on topics related to Islam and Pakistan, nine of which have been translated into English and other languages.&lt;ref name="tanzeem.org"/&gt;

== Health ==
Ahmed relinquished the leadership of Tanzeem-e-Islami in October 2002 because of bad health. Hafiz Akif Saeed is the present Amir of the Tanzeem to whom all rufaqaa of Tanzeem renewed their pledge of Baiyah.&lt;ref name="TanzeemAmeer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tanzeem.info/webapps/tip_dnnweb/Organization/TheAmeer.aspx |title=Biography of Ameer Tanzeem-e-Islami Hafiz Akif Saeed |publisher=Tanzeem.org |accessdate=22 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320022000/http://tanzeem.info/webapps/tip_dnnweb/Organization/TheAmeer.aspx |archivedate=20 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Like [[Wahiduddin Khan]], [[Naeem Siddiqui]] and [[Javed Ahmad Ghamidi]], Ahmed also worked closely with Syed [[Abul A'la Maududi]] (alternative spelling Syed Maudoodi; often referred to as Maulana Maududi) (1903–1979) and [[Amin Ahsan Islahi]]. Supporters describe his vision of Islam as having been synthesised from the diverse sources. He has also acknowledged the "deep influence" of [[Shah Waliullah Dehlawi]], the 18th century Indian Islamic leader, anti-colonial activist, jurist, and scholar.&lt;ref name="KhilafaPerson"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.khilafahmovement.org/israrahmed.htm |title=The Khilafah Movement Famous Personalities |publisher=Khilafahmovement.org |date=26 April 1932 |accessdate=26 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004224132/http://www.khilafahmovement.org/israrahmed.htm |archivedate=4 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

"In the context of Qur'anic exegesis and understanding, Ahmed was a firm traditionalist of the genre of Mehmood Hassan Deobandi and Allama Shabbir Ahmed Usmani; yet he presented Qur'anic teachings in a scientific and enlightened way".&lt;ref name="Dr.IA"/&gt;
Ahmed believed in what he called "Islamic revolutionary thought," which consists of the idea that Islam &amp;ndash; the teachings of the Qur'an and the [[Sunnah]] &amp;ndash; must be implemented in the social, cultural, juristic, political, and economic spheres of life. In this he is said to follow Mohammad Rafiuddin and [[Muhammad Iqbal]]. The first attempt towards the actualisation of this concept was reportedly made by Abul Kalam Azad through his short-lived party, the Hizbullah. Another attempt was made by Sayyid [[Abul Ala Maududi]] through his Jamaat-e-Islami party. Although the Jamaat-e-Islami has reached some influence, Ahmed resigned from the party in 1956 when it entered the electoral process and believed that such an involvement led to "degeneration from a pure Islamic revolutionary party to a mere political one".&lt;ref name="TanzeemHistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tanzeem.info/webapps/tip_dnnweb/Organization/Background.aspx |title=Background/History of Tanzeem-e-Islami |publisher=Tanzeem.org |date= |accessdate=22 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320020956/http://tanzeem.info/webapps/tip_dnnweb/Organization/Background.aspx |archivedate=20 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tanzeem-e-Islami==
Originally a member of [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], Ahmed became disappointed with its electoral activity, "significant policy matters", and what he saw as the "lack of effort to create an Islamic renaissance through the revolutionary process."  He and some other individuals resigned from JI and in 1956 founded the nucleus of Tanzeem-e-Islami, an attempt to create a "disciplined organization." "A resolution was passed which subsequently became the Mission Statement of Tanzeem-e-Islami."&lt;ref name="Dr.IA"/&gt;

Along with his work to revive "the Qur'an-centered Islamic perennial philosophy and world-view" Ahmed aimed with his party to "reform the society in a practical way with the ultimate objective of establishing a true Islamic State, or the System of [[Caliphate|Khilafah]]".&lt;ref name="tanzeem.org"/&gt;

===Hizb ut-Tahrir===
According to Tanzeem-e-Islami's FAQ, while both [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and Tanzeem-e-Islami share belief in reviving the Caliphate as a means of implementing Islam in all spheres of life, Tanzeem-e-Islami does not believe in involvement in electoral politics, armed struggle, coup d'état to establish a caliphate, and has no set plan of detailed workings for the future Caliphate. Tanzeem-e-Islami emphasises that iman (faith) among Muslims must be revived in "a significant portion of the Muslim society" before there can be an Islamic revival.&lt;ref name="tanzeemFAQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tanzeem.info/webapps/tip_dnnweb/FAQs.aspx |title=Tamzeem-e-Islami Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Tanzeem.org |accessdate=22 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320023217/http://tanzeem.info/webapps/tip_dnnweb/FAQs.aspx |archivedate=20 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abul Ala Maududi===
While Ahmed "considers himself a product" of the teachings of "comprehensive and holistic concept of the Islamic obligations" of [[Abul Ala Maududi]], he opposes Jamaat-e-Islami's "plunge" into "the arena of power politics," which he considered to have been "disastrous."&lt;ref name="tanzeemFAQ"/&gt;

===Danger of foreign powers===
{{Main|2011 NATO attack in Pakistan|2011 India-Pakistan border shooting|2008 Mumbai attacks}}
In response to the [[2007 Pakistani state of emergency|state of emergency]] in 2007, Ahmed called for lifting the emergency, reinstatement of [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]] [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of Pakistan|justices]], and withdrawal of all actions taken in pursuance of the proclamation of emergency and the [[Provisional Constitutional Order|PCO law]] besides resignation of [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Pervez Musharraf]].&lt;ref name="Dawn News Archives 2007"/&gt;

In a televised press conference, Ahmed called for resignation of [[Pervez Musharraf]] from both [[President of Pakistan|president]] and [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|chief of army staff]].&lt;ref name="Dawn News Archives 2007"/&gt; Ahmed appealed to President General Musharraf to lift the state emergency and step down for the nation's greater interests.&lt;ref name="Dawn News Archives 2007"/&gt; At the television news channels, Ahmed also predicted and warned the nation that, "If the situation worsens, the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO forces]] are waiting on the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|western front]] to move into Pakistan and may deprive the country of its [[Nuclear power in Pakistan|nuclear assets]] while on the [[Eastern Pakistan|eastern front]], India is ready to stage an [[Operation Jackpot|action replay]] of [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1971|1971 events]] and has alerted its [[Indian Armed Forces|armed forces]] to intervene in to check threats to peace in the region."&lt;ref name="Dawn News Archives 2007"&gt;{{cite news|last=Our Reporter|title=Dr Israr advises Musharraf to call it a day|url=http://archives.dawn.com/2007/11/20/nat20.htm|accessdate=16 March 2013|newspaper=Dawn News Archives 2007|date=20 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversy==

In 2006 Canada's ''[[National Post]]'' newspapers quoted Ahmed as saying that "Islam's renaissance will begin in Pakistan... because the Arab world is living under subjugation. Only the Pakistan region has the potential for standing up against the nefarious designs of the global power-brokers and to resist the rising tides of the Jewish/Zionist hegemony.&lt;ref name="investigativeproject.org"&gt;[http://www.investigativeproject.org/article/539 "FBI's Latest Outreach Outrage", by [[Steven Emerson]], IPT News, 7 November 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Asia Times'' reports that in September 1995 Ahmed told the annual convention of the Islamic Society of North America: "The process of the revival of Islam in different parts of the world is real. A final showdown between the Muslim world and the non-Muslim world, which has been captured by the Jews, would soon take place. The Gulf War was just a rehearsal for the coming conflict." He appealed to the Muslims of the world, including those in the US, to prepare themselves for the coming conflict.&lt;ref name="atimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/EG03Df07.html |title="Al-Qaeda clone takes root in the US," by B Raman, July 3, 2003 |publisher=Atimes.com |date=3 July 2003 |accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and funeral==

Ahmed died of cardiac arrest at his home in Lahore on the morning of 14 April 2010.&lt;ref name="Renowned Islamic scholar Dr Israr Ahmed is dead"&gt;{{cite web |last=News |first=Arab |url=http://arabnews.com/world/article43026.ece |title=Renowned Islamic scholar Dr Israr Ahmed is dead |publisher=Arabnews.com |date= |accessdate=26 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927150815/http://arabnews.com/world/article43026.ece |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his son, his health deteriorated at around 1:30&amp;nbsp;am with pain in the back.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5117">'''Jean-Baptiste Robinet''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁɔbinɛ|lang}}; 23 June 1735 &amp;ndash; 24 March 1820), also known as Jean-Baptiste-René Robinet, was a [[France|French]] [[naturalist]], known for his five-volume work ''De la nature'' (1761-8). He was also involved in the sequel publications to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', took on [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]'s editorial role, and was a translator of numerous works to the [[French language]].

==Life==
Robinet was born in [[Rennes]] on 23 June 1735&lt;!--Note Biographie Universelle states 1745--&gt;, and died there on 24 March 1820. Early in life he was educated by the Jesuits and embraced the rule of St. Ignatius, but soon regretted his loss of freedom and entered the world of letters. He traveled to Holland to publish his book ''De la nature'' which in time gained notoriety due to the peculiar opinions presented in the book. Upon his return to Paris in 1778 he was appointed [[Censorship in France|royal censor]] and private secretary to [[Antoine-Jean Amelot de Chaillou]]. During the [[French revolution]] he lost all employment and retired to his home, where he lived in relative seclusion, occupied only with family duties. He had been a disciple of [[encyclopédistes]], but was also committed to the principles of the church. He eventually returned to the church and signed a recantation of his errors.&lt;ref&gt;François-Xavier Feller, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fk5xmFBLUhsC&amp; ''Biographie Universelle ou Dictionnaire Historique''... Vol.7] J. Leroux (1849) p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Robinet is one of the many precursors in the [[history of evolutionary thought]] who contributed to the process which later crystallized in the work of [[Charles Darwin]]. Jean-Baptiste was led from observations into the idea of the [[transmutation of species]] and so into a theory of [[evolution]], which in some important respects anticipated modern ideas. In ''De la nature'', published in 1761, Nature was not God, but necessarily and eternally evolved from Divine essence. Creation is the everlasting work of the Deity, who from eternity has been working and smoothly progressing in the manner of Nature. There are no leaps. All things must have come from unity, which has been infinitely diversified. Kingdoms, classes and species are artificial works of man, of which Nature knows nothing. The orangutan was next to man in the scale of being. All the links of Nature's chain may not yet have been discovered, but they would be discovered before long.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bonamy Price]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=8YEFAAAAQAAJ&amp; ''The Contemporary Review'', Vol.14] "Nature Development and Theology" Strahan &amp; Co., Publishers (1870)&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinet represented a [[Teleology|teleological]] point of view in his discussions on evolution. All was produced from a divine, pre-existing, and static master-plan. He wrote that in diverse lower animals, Nature advances, groping towards the excellence of the human being. Some imperceptible progress is made at each step, each new production a variation of the primitive design, becoming very responsive after a number of metamorphoses. The development of the human machine had taken a long succession of arrangements, compositions and dissolutions, additions and deletions, alterations, cancellations, and changes of all kinds.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Baptiste-René Robinet, ''Considérations philosophiques de la gradation des formes de l’être, ou les essais de la nature qui apprend à faire l’homme'', 1768, pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinet, in collaboration with [[Charles-Joseph Panckoucke]] were exponents of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', and published a supplement to it in four volumes (1776-1777). He also participated in the publication of one of the first works of its kind, the thirty volume social science distionary ''Dictionnaire universel des sciences morales, économique, politique et diplomatique; ou bibliothèque de l’homme d’État et du citoyen'' (1777–83) created as a "library of statesmen and citizens”.&lt;ref&gt;Daniele Besomi (editor), "Crises and cycles in economic dictionaries and encyclopedias", London: Routledge, 2012, pp. 15 and 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinet also published numerous translations into French, in particular, works by [[David Hume]] and [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Jean-Baptiste-René Robinet|Jean-Baptiste-René Robinet]], French Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt; He was probably the translator of Hume's ''Essays Moral and Political'' and drew heavily upon it in his ''Considerations sur l'état présent de la littérature en Europe''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jones, ''The Reception of David Hume In Europe'' Continuum International Publishing Group (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and her third, ''Morality Play: Case Studies in Ethics'', was published by [[McGraw-Hill]] in 2005&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, Jessica (2005). ''Morality Play''. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; (with a second edition published by Waveland Press in 2013&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, Jessica (2013). ''Morality Play''. Indianapolis: Waveland Press.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Having previously focussed her research on human health, including her early research interests in the connections between health and the environment, Pierce began to focus her research on animals in the 2000s.&lt;ref name="Welcome"/&gt; She co-authored ''Wild Justice: The Moral Lives of Animals'' with the [[ecologist]] and [[ethologist]] [[Marc Bekoff]], and this was published in 2010 by the [[University of Chicago Press]].&lt;ref&gt;Bekoff, Marc, and Jessica Pierce (2010). ''Wild Justice''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, the authors draw upon evolutionary theory and ethology to argue that many animals display evidence of [[consciousness]], as well as a range of behaviours which they categorise under the categories of ''[[cooperation]]'', ''[[empathy]]'' and ''[[justice]]''. These observations are used to make a case that animals may have a sense of [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;Sax, Boria (2010). "Book review: ''Wild Justice: The Moral Lives of Animals''".

'''John Rogers Searle''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɜr|l}}; born 31 July 1932) is an American [[philosopher]]. He is currently Willis S. and Marion Slusser Professor Emeritus of the Philosophy of Mind and Language and Professor of the Graduate School at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Widely noted for his contributions to the [[philosophy of language]], [[philosophy of mind]], and [[social philosophy]], he began teaching at UC Berkeley in 1959.

As an undergraduate at the [[University of Wisconsin]], Searle was secretary of "Students against [[Joseph McCarthy]]". He received all his university degrees, BA, MA, and DPhil, from the [[University of Oxford]], where he held his first faculty positions. Later, at UC Berkeley, he became the first tenured professor to join the 1964–1965 [[Free Speech Movement]]. In the late 1980s, Searle challenged the restrictions of Berkeley's 1980 [[Rent control in the United States|rent stabilization ordinance]]. Following what came to be known as the California Supreme Court's "Searle Decision" of 1990, Berkeley changed its rent control policy, leading to large rent increases between 1991 and 1994.

In 2000 Searle received the [[Jean Nicod Prize]];&lt;ref name="cnrs.fr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnrs.fr/cw/en/nomi/prix/nicod2000.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923222438/http://www.cnrs.fr/cw/en/nomi/prix/nicod2000.html |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004, the [[National Humanities Medal]];&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/news/press-release/2004-11-17|title=President Bush Awards 2004 National Humanities Medals|author=|date=|work=NEH.gov|access-date=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2006, the [[Mind &amp; Brain Prize]]. Searle's early work on [[speech acts]], influenced by [[J. L. Austin]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], helped establish his reputation. His notable concepts include the "[[Chinese room]]" argument against [[Computational theory of mind|"strong" artificial intelligence]]. In March 2017, Searle was accused of [[sexual assault]].

==Biography==
Searle's father, G. W. Searle, an electrical engineer, was employed by [[AT&amp;T Corporation]]; his mother, Hester Beck Searle, was a physician.{{citation needed|date= November 2017}}

Searle began his college education at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] and in his junior year became a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]] at the [[University of Oxford]], where he obtained all his university degrees, BA, MA, and DPhil.{{citation needed|date= November 2017}}

His first two faculty positions were at Oxford as Research Lecturer, and Lecturer and Tutor at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]].{{citation needed|date= November 2017}}

===Politics===
While an undergraduate at the [[University of Wisconsin]], Searle became the secretary of "Students against [[Joseph McCarthy]]".&lt;ref name="ditext.com"&gt;http://www.ditext.com/searle/campus/1.html&lt;/ref&gt; (McCarthy at that time served as the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|junior senator]] from [[Wisconsin]].) In 1959 Searle began teaching at Berkeley, and he was the first tenured professor to join the 1964–65 [[Free Speech Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~jsearle/Free+Speech+Movement-1.htm|title= Socrates and Berkeley Scholars Web Hosting Services Have Been Retired - Web Platform Services|website= socrates.berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1969, while serving as chairman of the Academic Freedom Committee of the Academic Senate of the University of California,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ditext.com/searle/campus/4.html&lt;/ref&gt; he supported the university in its dispute with students over the [[People's Park (Berkeley)|People's Park]].
In ''The Campus War: A Sympathetic Look at the University in Agony'' (1971),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ditext.com/searle/campus/campus.html |title= The Campus War |accessdate= 2012-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Searle investigates the causes behind the campus protests of the era. In it he declares: "I have been attacked by both the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] and ... several radical polemicists ... Stylistically, the attacks are interestingly similar. Both rely heavily on insinuation and innuendo, and both display a hatred{{spaced ndash}}one might almost say terror{{spaced ndash}}of close analysis and dissection of argument." He asserts that "My wife was threatened that I (and other members of the administration) would be [[assassination|assassinated]] or violently attacked."&lt;ref name="ditext.com"/&gt;

In the late 1980s, Searle, along with other landlords, petitioned Berkeley's rental board to raise the limits on how much he could charge tenants under the city's 1980 [[Rent control in the United States |rent-stabilization ordinance]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''Searle v. City of Berkeley Rent Stabilization Bd.'' (1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 1251, 1253 [243 Cal.Rptr. 449]&lt;/ref&gt; The rental board refused to consider Searle's petition and Searle filed suit, charging a violation of due process. In 1990, in what came to be known as the "Searle Decision", the California Supreme Court upheld Searle's argument in part and Berkeley changed its rent-control policy, leading to large rent-increases between 1991 and 1994. Searle was reported to see the issue as one of fundamental rights, being quoted as saying "The treatment of landlords in Berkeley is comparable to the treatment of blacks in the South...our rights have been massively violated and we are here to correct that injustice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2004-12-14/article/20296?headline=Letters-to-the-Editor|title= Letters to the Editor. Category: Features from The Berkeley Daily Planet|first= Berkeley Daily Planet, Berkeley|last= California|date= December 14, 2004|work= BerkeleyDailyPlanet.com|access-date= April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court described the debate as a "morass of political invective, ad hominem attack, and policy argument".&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Korngold, Whatever Happened to Landlord-Tenant Law?, 77 Neb. L. Rev. (1998).
Available at: http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/nlr/vol77/iss4/5&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]], Searle wrote an article arguing that the attacks were a particular event in a long-term struggle against forces that are intractably opposed to the United States, and signaled support for a more aggressive [[Neoconservatism|neoconservative]] [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] [[foreign policy]]. He called for the realization that the United States is in a more-or-less permanent [[war|state of war]] with these forces. Moreover, a probable course of action would be to deny [[terrorist]]s the use of foreign territory from which to stage their attacks. Finally, he alluded to the long-term nature of the conflict and blamed the attacks on the lack of American resolve to deal forcefully with America's enemies over the past several decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~jsearle/pdf/terrorism.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515215424/http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~jsearle/pdf/terrorism.pdf |archive-date=2008-05-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual assault allegations===
In March 2017, Searle became the subject of [[sexual assault]] allegations. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported: "A new lawsuit alleges that university officials failed to properly respond to complaints that John Searle, an 84-year-old renowned philosophy professor, sexually assaulted his 24-year-old research associate last July and cut her pay when she rejected his advances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-essential-education-updates-southern-lawuit-alleges-a-uc-berkeley-philosophy-1490299535-htmlstory.html|last= Watanabe|first= Tessa|title= Lawsuit alleges that a UC Berkeley professor sexually assaulted his researcher and cut her pay when she rejected him|work= Los Angeles Times|date= March 23, 2017|access-date= March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2017/03/23/berkeley-renowned-philosopher-john-searle-accused-of-sexual-assault-and-harassment-by-former-cal-aide|last= Fraley|first= Malaika|title= Berkeley: Renowned philosopher John Searle accused of sexual assault and harassment at UC Berkeley|work= East Bay Times|date= March 23, 2017|access-date= March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case brought to light several earlier complaints against Searle, on which Berkeley allegedly had failed to act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.buzzfeed.com/katiejmbaker/john-searle-complaints-uc-berkeley|last= Baker|first= Katie J. M. |title= UC Berkeley Was Warned About Its Star Professor Years Before Sexual Harassment Lawsuit|work= BuzzFeedNews|date= April 7, 2017|access-date= April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
The lawsuit, filed in a California court on March 21, 2017, sought damages both from Searle and from the [[Regents of the University of California]] as his employers. It also claims that Jennifer Hudin, the director of the John Searle Center for Social Ontology, where the complainant had been employed as an assistant to Searle, has stated that Searle "has had sexual relationships with his students and others in the past in exchange for academic, monetary or other benefits".&lt;ref name="BuzzFeed"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.buzzfeed.com/katiejmbaker/famous-philosophy-professor-accused-sexual-harassment|last= Baker|first= Katie J.M.|title= A Former Student Says UC Berkeley's Star Philosophy Professor Groped Her And Watched Porn At Work|work= BuzzFeedNews|date= March 24, 2017|access-date= March 28, 2017}} Contains facsimile of the suit.&lt;!--which is why BuzzFeed, not normally relied on by WP, is cited--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
After news of the lawsuit became public, several previous allegations of sexual harassment by Searle were also revealed.&lt;ref&gt;

===Awards and recognitions===
Searle has five honorary-doctorate degrees from four different countries and is an honorary visiting professor at [[Tsing Hua University]] and at [[East China Normal University]].

In 2000 Searle received the [[Jean Nicod Prize]];&lt;ref name="cnrs.fr"/&gt; in 2004, the [[National Humanities Medal]];&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and in 2006, the [[Mind &amp; Brain Prize]].

==Philosophy==

===Speech acts===
Searle's early work, which did a great deal to establish his reputation, was on [[speech act]]s. He attempted to synthesize ideas from many colleagues{{spaced ndash}}including [[J. L. Austin]] (the "[[illocutionary act]]", from ''[[J. L. Austin#How to Do Things With Words|How To Do Things with Words]]''), [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[G.C.J. Midgley]] (the distinction between regulative and constitutive rules){{spaced ndash}}with his own thesis that such acts are constituted by the [[rules of language]]. He also drew on the work of [[Paul Grice]] (the analysis of meaning as an attempt at being understood), Hare and Stenius (the distinction, concerning meaning, between illocutionary force and propositional content), [[P. F. Strawson]], [[John Rawls]] and [[William Alston]], who maintained that sentence meaning consists in sets of regulative rules requiring the speaker to perform the illocutionary act indicated by the sentence and that such acts involve the utterance of a sentence which (a) indicates that one performs the act; (b) means what one says; and (c) addresses an audience in the vicinity.

In his 1969 book ''Speech Acts'', Searle sets out to combine all these elements to give his account of [[illocutionary act]]s. There he provides an analysis of what he considers the prototypical illocutionary act of promising and offers sets of semantical rules intended to represent the [[linguistic meaning]] of devices indicating further illocutionary act types. Among the concepts presented in the book is the distinction between the "illocutionary force" and the "propositional content" of an [[utterance]]. Searle does not precisely define the former as such, but rather introduces several possible illocutionary forces by example. According to Searle, the sentences...
# Sam smokes habitually.
# Does Sam smoke habitually?
# Sam, smoke habitually!
# Would that Sam smoked habitually!

...each indicate the same propositional content (Sam smoking habitually) but differ in the illocutionary force indicated (respectively, a statement, a question, a command and an expression of desire).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John R. Searle |title=Speech Acts: An Essay in the Philosophy of Language |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 1969 | isbn= 9780521096263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a later account, which Searle presents in ''Intentionality'' (1983) and which differs in important ways from the one suggested in ''Speech Acts'', illocutionary acts are characterised by their having "conditions of satisfaction" (an idea adopted from Strawson's 1971 paper "Meaning and Truth") and a "[[direction of fit]]" (an idea adopted from [[Elizabeth Anscombe]]). For example, the statement "John bought two candy bars" is satisfied if and only if it is true, i.e. John did buy two candy bars. By contrast, the command "John, buy two candy bars!" is satisfied if and only if John carries out the action of purchasing two candy bars. Searle refers to the first as having the "word-to-world" direction of fit, since the words are supposed to change to accurately represent the world, and the second as having the "world-to-word" direction of fit, since the world is supposed to change to match the words. (There is also the double direction of fit, in which the relationship goes both ways, and the null or zero direction of fit, in which it goes neither way because the propositional content is presupposed, as in "I'm sorry I ate John's candy bars.")

In ''Foundations of Illocutionary Logic''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John R. Searle, Daniel Vanderveken |title=Foundations of Illocutionary Logic |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year= 1985 | isbn= 0-521-26324-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Foundations_of_illocutionary_logic.html?id=M_c8AAAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1985, with Daniel Vanderveken), Searle prominently uses the notion of the "illocutionary point".&lt;ref&gt;Although Searle does not mention earlier uses of the concept, it originates from [http://philpapers.org/rec/SESP Alexander Sesonske's article "Performatives"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle's speech-act theory has been challenged by several thinkers in a variety of ways. Collections of articles referring to Searle's account are found in Burkhardt 1990&lt;ref&gt;Burkhardt, Armin (ed.), Speech Acts, Meaning and Intentions: Critical Approaches to the Philosophy of John R. Searle. Berlin / New York 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lepore / van Gulick 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Lepore, Ernest / van Gulick, Robert (eds): John Searle and his Critics. Oxford: Basil Blackwell 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{overly detailed|section|date=April 2017}}
In the early 1970s, Searle had a brief exchange with [[Jacques Derrida]] regarding speech-act theory. The exchange was characterized by a degree of mutual hostility between the philosophers, each of whom accused the other of having misunderstood his basic points.&lt;ref name=limitedinc&gt;Derrida, Jacques. ''Limited, Inc.'' Northwestern University Press, 1988. p. 29: "...I have read some of his [Searle's] work (more, in any case, than he seems to have read of mine)"&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}&lt;!--Footnote provided only sources half the claim.--&gt; Searle was particularly hostile to Derrida's [[deconstruction]]ist framework and much later refused to let his response to Derrida be printed along with Derrida's papers in the 1988 collection ''[[Limited Inc]]''. Searle did not consider Derrida's approach to be legitimate philosophy or even intelligible writing and argued that he did not want to legitimize the deconstructionist point of view by dedicating any attention to it. Consequently, some critics&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, Ian. 2004. "''un dialogue de sourds?'' Some implications of the Austin–Searle–Derrida debate", in ''Jacques Derrida: critical thought''. Ian Maclachlan (ed.) Ashgate Publishing, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; have considered the exchange to be a series of elaborate misunderstandings rather than a debate, while others&lt;ref name="Alfino"&gt;"Another Look at the Derrida-Searle Debate". Mark Alfino. Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric, Vol. 24, No. 2 (1991), pp. 143–152 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/40237667]&lt;/ref&gt; have seen either Derrida or Searle gaining the upper hand. The level of hostility can be seen from Searle's statement that "It would be a mistake to regard Derrida's discussion of Austin as a confrontation between two prominent philosophical traditions", to which Derrida replied that that sentence was "the only sentence of the 'reply' to which I can subscribe".&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Glendinning]]. 2001. ''Arguing with Derrida''. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators have frequently interpreted the exchange as a prominent example of a confrontation between [[Analytical philosophy|analytical]] and [[continental philosophy]].

The '''Searle–Derrida debate'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; began in 1972, when, in his paper  "Signature Event Context", Derrida analyzed [[J. L. Austin]]'s theory of the [[illocutionary act]]. While sympathetic to Austin's departure from a purely denotational account of language to one that includes "force", Derrida was sceptical of the framework of normativity employed by Austin. He argued that Austin had missed the fact that any speech event is framed by a "structure of absence" (the words that are left unsaid due to contextual constraints) and by "iterability" (the repeatability of linguistic elements outside of their context). Derrida argued that the focus on [[intentionality]] in speech-act theory was misguided because intentionality is restricted to that which is already established as a possible intention. He also took issue with the way Austin had excluded the study of fiction, non-serious or "parasitic" speech, wondering whether this exclusion was because Austin had considered these speech genres governed by different structures of meaning, or simply due to a lack of interest.

In his brief reply to Derrida, "Reiterating the Differences: A Reply to Derrida", Searle argued that Derrida's critique was unwarranted because it assumed that Austin's theory attempted to give a full account of language and meaning when its aim was much narrower. Searle considered the omission of parasitic discourse forms to be justified by the narrow scope of Austin's inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Gregor Campbell. 1993. "John R. Searle" in Irene Rima Makaryk (ed). Encyclopedia of contemporary literary theory: approaches, scholars, terms. University of Toronto Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Searle, "Reiterating the Différences: A Reply to Derrida", Glyph 2 (Baltimore MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; Searle agreed with Derrida's proposal that intentionality presupposes iterability, but did not apply the same concept of intentionality used by Derrida, being unable or unwilling to engage with the continental conceptual apparatus.&lt;ref name="Alfino"/&gt; This, in turn, caused Derrida to criticize Searle for not being sufficiently familiar with [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] perspectives on intentionality.&lt;ref name="Hobson"&gt;Marian Hobson. 1998. Jacques Derrida: opening lines. Psychology Press. pp. 95–97&lt;/ref&gt; Searle also argued that Derrida's disagreement with Austin turned on his having misunderstood Austin's (and Peirce's) [[type–token distinction]] and his failure to understand Austin's concept of failure in relation to [[performativity]]. Some critics&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; have suggested that Searle, by being so grounded in the analytical tradition, was unable to engage with Derrida's continental phenomenological tradition and was at fault for the unsuccessful nature of the exchange.

Derrida, in his response to Searle ({{nowrap|"a b c ..."}} in ''Limited Inc''), ridiculed Searle's positions. Arguing that a clear sender of Searle's message could not be established, he suggested that Searle had formed with Austin a ''société à responsabilité limitée'' (a "[[limited liability company]]") due to the ways in which the ambiguities of authorship within Searle's reply circumvented the very speech act of his reply. Searle did not respond. Later in 1988, Derrida tried to review his position and his critiques of Austin and Searle, reiterating that he found the constant appeal to "normality" in the analytical tradition to be problematic.&lt;ref name="Alfino"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, "Afterwords" in ''Limited, Inc.''

In the debate, Derrida praises Austin's work, but argues that he is wrong to banish what Austin calls "infelicities" from the "normal" operation of language. One "infelicity," for instance, occurs when it cannot be known whether a given speech act is "sincere" or "merely citational" (and therefore possibly ironic, etc.). Derrida argues that every iteration is necessarily "citational", due to the graphematic nature of speech and writing, and that language could not work at all without the ever-present and ineradicable possibility of such alternate readings. Derrida takes Searle to task for his attempt to get around this issue by grounding final authority in the speaker's inaccessible "intention". Derrida argues that intention cannot possibly govern how an iteration signifies, once it becomes hearable or readable. All speech acts borrow a language whose significance is determined by historical-linguistic context, and by the alternate possibilities that this context makes possible. This significance, Derrida argues, cannot be altered or governed by the whims of intention.

In 1995, Searle gave a brief reply to Derrida in ''The Construction of Social Reality''. "Derrida, as far as I can tell, does not have an argument. He simply declares that there is nothing outside of texts (''Il n'y a pas de 'hors-texte''')."  Then, in ''Limited Inc.'', Derrida "apparently takes it all back", claiming that he meant only "the banality that everything exists in some ''context'' or other!"  Derrida and others like him present "an array of weak or even nonexistent arguments for a conclusion that seems preposterous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Searle|first=John|title=The Construction of Social Reality|location=London|publisher=Allen Lane The Penguin P.|date=1995|pages= 159–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Of Grammatology]]'' (1967), Derrida claims that a text must not be interpreted by reference to anything "outside of language", which for him means "outside of writing in general".  He adds:  "''There is nothing outside of the text'' [there is no outside-text;  ''il n'y a pas de hors-texte'']" (brackets in the translation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Derrida|first=Jacques|title=Of Grammatology|translator=[[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]]|location=Baltimore|publisher=Johns Hopkins U.P.|date=1976|page=158}}&lt;!--Is this the same in the "corrected" translation, 1997?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a metaphor:  ''un hors-texte'' is a bookbinding term, referring to a 'plate' bound among pages of text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collins Robert French-English English-French Dictionary|location=London/Paris|publisher=Collins/Robert|edition=2|date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Searle cites Derrida's supplementary metaphor rather than his initial contention.  However, whether Searle's objection is good against that contention is the point in debate.

===Intentionality and the background===
Searle defines [[intentionality]] as the power of minds to be about, to represent (see [[Correspondence theory of truth]]), or to stand for, things, properties and states of affairs in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, ''Intentionality'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of intentionality is an important part of discussions of Searle's "Philosophy of Mind". Searle emphasizes that the word 'intentionality, (the part of the mind directed to/from/about objects and relations in the world independent of mind) should not be confused with the word 'intensionality' (the logical property of some sentences that do not pass the test of 'extensionality').&lt;ref&gt;Searle "Making the Social World: The Structure of Human Civilization" (2010) p. 48-62&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Intentionality: An Essay in the Philosophy of Mind'' (1983), Searle applies certain elements of his account(s) of "illocutionary acts" to the investigation of [[intentionality]]. Searle also introduces a technical term ''the Background'',&lt;ref&gt;Searle, ''Intentionality'' (1983); ''The Rediscovery of the Mind'' (1992) ch. 8&lt;/ref&gt; which, according to him, has been the source of much philosophical discussion ("though I have been arguing for this thesis for almost twenty years," Searle writes,&lt;ref&gt;"Literary Theory and Its Discontents", ''New Literary History'', 640&lt;/ref&gt; "many people whose opinions I respect still disagree with me about it"). He calls ''Background'' the set of abilities, capacities, tendencies, and dispositions that humans have and that are not themselves intentional states. Thus, when someone asks us to "cut the cake" we know to use a knife and when someone asks us to "cut the grass" we know to use a lawnmower (and not vice versa), even though the actual request did not include this detail. Searle sometimes supplements his reference to the ''Background'' with the concept of ''the Network'', one's network of other beliefs, desires, and other intentional states necessary for any particular intentional state to make sense. Searle argues that the concept of a Background is similar to the concepts provided by several other thinkers, including Wittgenstein's [[private language argument]] ("the work of the later Wittgenstein is in large part about the Background"&lt;ref&gt;Searle, ''The Rediscovery of the Mind'' (1992), p.177&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s ''[[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]]''.

To give an example, two chess players might be engaged in a bitter struggle at the board, but they share all sorts of Background presuppositions: that they will take turns to move, that no one else will intervene, that they are both playing to the same rules, that the fire alarm won't go off, that the board won't suddenly disintegrate, that their opponent won't magically turn into a grapefruit, and so on indefinitely. As most of these possibilities won't have occurred to either player,&lt;ref&gt;Searle, ''The Rediscovery of the Mind'' (1992), p.185&lt;/ref&gt; Searle thinks the Background must be unconscious, though elements of it can be called to consciousness (if the fire alarm does go off, say).

In his debate with Derrida, Searle argued against Derrida's view that a statement can be disjoined from the original intentionality of its author, for example when no longer connected to the original author, while still being able to produce meaning. Searle maintained that even if one was to see a written statement with no knowledge of authorship it would still be impossible to escape the question of intentionality, because "''a meaningful sentence is just a standing possibility of the (intentional) speech act''". For Searle ascribing intentionality to a statement was a basic requirement for attributing it any meaning at all.&lt;ref name="reply"&gt;John Searle, "''Reiterating the Différences: A Reply to Derrida'"', Glyph 2 (Baltimore MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1977 p. 202''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Graff. 1988. Summary of Reiterating the differences. in Derrida, JAcques. Limited Inc. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consciousness===
Building upon his views about intentionality, Searle presents a view concerning consciousness in his book ''The Rediscovery of the Mind'' (1992). He argues that, starting with behaviorism (an early but influential scientific view, succeeded by many later accounts that Searle also dismisses), much of modern philosophy has tried to deny the existence of consciousness, with little success. In ''Intentionality'', he parodies several alternative theories of consciousness by replacing their accounts of intentionality with comparable accounts of the hand:

:No one would think of saying, for example, "Having a hand is just being disposed to certain sorts of behavior such as grasping" (manual [[behaviorism]]), or "Hands can be defined entirely in terms of their causes and effects" (manual [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]]), or "For a system to have a hand is just for it to be in a certain computer state with the right sorts of inputs and outputs" (manual [[Turing machine]] functionalism), or "Saying that a system has hands is just adopting a certain stance toward it" (the [[intentional stance|manual stance]]). (p. 263)

Searle argues that philosophy has been trapped by a [[false dichotomy]]: that, on the one hand, the world consists of nothing but objective particles in fields of force, but that yet, on the other hand, consciousness is clearly a subjective first-person experience.

Searle says simply that both are true: consciousness is a real subjective experience, caused by the physical processes of the brain. (A view which he suggests might be called ''[[biological naturalism]]''.)

====Ontological subjectivity====
Searle has argued&lt;ref&gt;Searle, J R: ''The Mystery of Consciousness'' (1997) p. 95-131&lt;/ref&gt; that critics like [[Daniel Dennett]], who (he claims) insist that discussing subjectivity is unscientific because science presupposes objectivity, are making a [[category error]]. Perhaps the goal of science is to establish and validate statements which are ''epistemically'' objective, (i.e., whose truth can be discovered and evaluated by any interested party), but are not necessarily ''ontologically'' objective.

Searle calls any [[value judgment]] epistemically ''subjective''. Thus, "[[Mount McKinley|McKinley]] is prettier than [[Mount Everest|Everest]]" is "epistemically subjective", whereas "McKinley is higher than Everest" is "epistemically objective." In other words, the latter statement is evaluable (in fact, falsifiable) by an understood ('background') criterion for mountain height, like 'the summit is so many meters above sea level'. No such criteria exist for prettiness.

Beyond this distinction, Searle thinks there are certain phenomena (including all conscious experiences) that are ''ontologically'' subjective, i.e. can only exist as subjective experience. For example, although it might be subjective or objective in the epistemic sense, a doctor's note that a patient suffers from back pain is an ontologically ''objective'' claim: it counts as a medical diagnosis only because the existence of back pain is "an objective fact of medical science".&lt;ref&gt;Searle, J R: ''The Mystery of Consciousness'' (1997) p.122&lt;/ref&gt; The pain itself, however, is ''ontologically subjective'': it is only experienced by the person having it.

Searle goes on to affirm that "where consciousness is concerned, the existence of the appearance ''is'' the reality".&lt;ref&gt;Searle, J R: ''The Mystery of Consciousness'' (1997) p.112&lt;/ref&gt; His view that the epistemic and ontological senses of objective/subjective are cleanly separable is crucial to his self-proclaimed [[biological naturalism]].

====Artificial intelligence====

{{See also|Chinese room|philosophy of artificial intelligence}}
A consequence of biological naturalism is that if we want to create a conscious being, we will have to duplicate whatever physical processes the brain goes through to cause consciousness. Searle thereby means to contradict what he calls "[[Chinese room#Strong AI|Strong AI]]", defined by the assumption that as soon as a certain kind of software is running on a computer, a conscious being is thereby created.&lt;ref&gt;". . . I call the view that all there is to having a mind is having a program, Strong AI, . . . " ''The Rediscovery of the Mind'', p.201&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Searle presented the "[[Chinese room]]" argument, which purports to prove the falsity of strong AI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.searle2.html "Minds, Brains and Programs"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010221025515/http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.searle2.html |date=2001-02-21 }}, ''The Behavioral and Brain Sciences''.3, pp.&amp;nbsp;417–424. (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; Assume you do not speak Chinese and imagine yourself in a room with two slits, a book, and some scratch paper. Someone slides you some Chinese characters through the first slit, you follow the instructions in the book, transcribing characters as instructed onto the scratch paper, and slide the resulting sheet out the second slit. To people on the outside world, it appears the room speaks Chinese—they slide Chinese statements in one slit and get valid responses in return—yet you do not understand a word of Chinese. This suggests, according to Searle, that no computer can ever understand Chinese or English, because, as the [[thought experiment]] suggests, being able to 'translate' Chinese into English does not entail 'understanding' either Chinese or English: all which the person in the thought experiment, and hence a computer, is able to do is to execute certain syntactic manipulations.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with John R. Searle | http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people/Searle/searle-con4.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=Jacob|title=Thinking Machines: The Search for Artificial Intelligence|journal=Distillations |date=2016|volume=2|issue=2|pages=14–23|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/thinking-machines-the-search-for-artificial-intelligence|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stevan Harnad]] argues that Searle's "Strong AI" is really just another name for [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] and [[computationalism]], and that these positions are the real targets of his critique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cogprints.org/4023/ Harnad, Stevan (2001)], "What's Wrong and Right About Searle's Chinese Room Argument", in M.; Preston, J., Essays on Searle's Chinese Room Argument, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Functionalists argue that consciousness can be defined as a set of informational processes inside the brain. It follows that anything that carries out the same informational processes as a human is also conscious. Thus, if we wrote a computer program that was conscious, we could run that computer program on, say, a system of ping-pong balls and beer cups and the system would be equally conscious, because it was running the same information processes.

Searle argues that this is impossible, since consciousness is a physical property, like digestion or fire. No matter how good a simulation of digestion you build on the computer, it will not digest anything; no matter how well you simulate fire, nothing will get burnt. By contrast, informational processes are  ''observer-relative'': observers pick out certain patterns in the world and consider them information processes, but information processes are not things-in-the-world themselves. Since they do not exist at a physical level, Searle argues, they cannot have ''causal efficacy'' and thus cannot cause consciousness. There is no physical law, Searle insists, that can see the equivalence between a personal computer, a series of ping-pong balls and beer cans, and a pipe-and-water system all implementing the same program.&lt;ref&gt;Searle 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social reality===
Searle extended his inquiries into observer-relative phenomena by trying to understand social reality. Searle begins by arguing collective intentionality (e.g. "we're going for a walk") is a distinct form of intentionality, not simply reducible to individual intentionality (e.g. "I'm going for a walk with him and I think he thinks he's going for a walk with me and he thinks I think I'm going for a walk with him and ...").

In ''The Construction of Social Reality'' (1995), Searle addresses the mystery of how social constructs like "baseball" or "money" can exist in a world consisting only of physical particles in fields of force. Adapting an idea by [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Elizabeth Anscombe]] in "On Brute Facts," Searle distinguishes between [[Brute fact|''brute facts'']], like the height of a mountain, and ''institutional facts'', like the score of a baseball game. Aiming at an explanation of social phenomena in terms of Anscombe's notion, he argues that society can be explained in terms of institutional facts, and institutional facts arise out of collective intentionality through constitutive rules with the logical form "X counts as Y in C". Thus, for instance, filling out a ballot counts as a vote in a polling place, getting so many votes counts as a victory in an election, getting a victory counts as being elected president in the presidential race, etc.

Many sociologists, however, do not see Searle's contributions to social theory as very significant. [[Neil Gross]], for example, argues that Searle's views on society are more or less a reconstitution of the sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]]'s theories of social facts, social institutions, collective representations, and the like. Searle's ideas are thus open to the same criticisms as Durkheim's.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Neil. "Comment on Searle", in ''Anthropological Theory'', vol. 6 (1): 45–56. 2006. https://www.scribd.com/doc/22379828/Gross-Comment-on-Searle&lt;/ref&gt; Searle responded that Durkheim's work was worse than he had originally believed and, admitting he had not read much of Durkheim's work, said that, "Because Durkheim's account seemed so impoverished I did not read any further in his work."&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John. "Durkheim versus Searle and the waves of thought", in ''Anthropological Theory'', vol. 6 (1): 57–69. https://www.scribd.com/doc/22379838/Searle-Reply-to-Gross&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Lukes]], however, responded to Searle's response to Gross and argued point by point against the allegations that Searle makes against Durkheim, essentially upholding Gross' argument that Searle's work bears great resemblance to Durkheim's. Lukes attributes Searle's miscomprehension of Durkheim's work to the fact that Searle never read Durkheim.&lt;ref&gt;Lukes, Steven.

====Searle–Lawson debate&lt;!--linked from 'Searle–Lawson debate'--&gt;====
In recent years, Searle's main interlocutor on issues of social ontology has been [[Tony Lawson]]. Although their accounts of social reality are similar, there are important differences. Lawson places emphasis on the notion of social totality whereas Searle prefers to refer to institutional facts. Furthermore, Searle believes that emergence implies causal reduction whereas Lawson argues that social totalities cannot be completed explained by the causal powers of their components. Searle also places language at the foundation of the construction of social reality while Lawson believes that community formation necessarily precedes the development of language and therefore there must be the possibility for non-linguistic social structure formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawson|first=Tony|date=2016-12-01|title=Comparing Conceptions of Social Ontology: Emergent Social Entities and/or Institutional Facts?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jtsb.12126/abstract|journal=Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour|language=en|volume=46|issue=4|pages=359–399|doi=10.1111/jtsb.12126|issn=1468-5914}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Searle|first=John R.|date=2016-12-01|title=The Limits of Emergence: Reply to Tony Lawson|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jtsb.12125/abstract|journal=Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour|language=en|volume=46|issue=4|pages=400–412|doi=10.1111/jtsb.12125|issn=1468-5914}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawson|first=Tony|date=2016-12-01|title=Some Critical Issues in Social Ontology: Reply to John Searle|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jtsb.12129/abstract|journal=Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour|language=en|volume=46|issue=4|pages=426–437|doi=10.1111/jtsb.12129|issn=1468-5914}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate is ongoing and takes place additionally through regular meetings of the Centre for Social Ontology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and the Cambridge Social Ontology Group at the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.csog.econ.cam.ac.uk/events/Workshop-CISO2|title=Workshop on Critical Issues in Social Ontology. — The Cambridge Social Ontology Group|last=|first=|date=|website=www.csog.econ.cam.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationality===
In ''Rationality in Action'' (2001), Searle argues that standard notions of rationality are badly flawed. According to what he calls the Classical Model, rationality is seen as something like a train track: you get on at one point with your beliefs and desires and the rules of rationality compel you all the way to a conclusion. Searle doubts this picture of rationality holds generally.

Searle briefly critiques one particular set of these rules: those of mathematical [[decision theory]]. He points out that its axioms require that anyone who valued a quarter and their life would, at some odds, bet their life for a quarter. Searle insists he would never take such a bet and believes that this stance is perfectly rational.

Most of his attack is directed against the common conception of rationality, which he believes is badly flawed. First, he argues that reasons don't cause you to do anything, because having sufficient reason ''wills'' (but doesn't ''force'') you to do that thing. So in any decision situation we experience a gap between our reasons and our actions. For example, when we decide to vote, we do not simply determine that we care most about economic policy and that we prefer candidate Jones's economic policy. We also have to make an effort to cast our vote. Similarly, every time a guilty smoker lights a cigarette they are aware of succumbing to their craving, not merely of acting automatically as they do when they exhale. It is this gap that makes us think we have ''freedom of the will''. Searle thinks whether we really have [[free will]] or not is an open question, but considers its absence highly unappealing because it makes the feeling of freedom of will an epiphenomenon, which is highly unlikely from the evolutionary point of view given its biological cost. He also says: " ''All rational activity presupposes free will'' ".&lt;ref&gt;''Rationality in Action'' by John R. Searle (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, Searle believes we can rationally do things that don't result from our own desires. It is widely believed that one cannot derive an "ought" from an "is", i.e. that facts about how the world is can never tell you what you should do ('[[Hume's Law]]'). By contrast, in so far as a fact is understood as relating to an institution (marriage, promises, commitments, etc.), which is to be understood as a system of constitutive rules, then what one should do can be understood as following from the institutional fact of what one has done; institutional fact, then, can be understood as opposed to the "brute facts" related to Hume's Law. For example, Searle believes the fact that you promised to do something means you should do it, because by making the promise you are participating in the constitutive rules that arrange the system of promise making itself, and therefore understand a "shouldness" as implicit in the mere factual action of promising. Furthermore, he believes that this provides a desire-independent reason for an action—if you order a drink at a bar, you should pay for it even if you have no desire to. This argument, which he first made in his paper, "How to Derive 'Ought' from 'Is'" (1964),&lt;ref&gt;John Searle, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2183201 How to Derive 'Ought' from 'Is']", ''The Philosophical Review'', '''73''':1 (January 1964), 43–58&lt;/ref&gt; remains highly controversial, but even three decades later Searle continued to defend his view that "..the traditional metaphysical distinction between fact and value cannot be captured by the linguistic distinction between 'evaluative' and 'descriptive' because all such speech act notions are already normative."&lt;ref&gt;John Searle in Thomas Mautner, "Dictionary of Philosophy" (Penguin 1996). {{ISBN|0-14-051250-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, Searle argues that much of rational deliberation involves adjusting our (often inconsistent) patterns of desires to decide between outcomes, not the other way around. While in the Classical Model, one would start from a desire to go to Paris greater than that of saving money and calculate the cheapest way to get there, in reality people balance the niceness of Paris against the costs of travel to decide which desire (visiting Paris or saving money) they value more. Hence, he believes rationality is not a system of rules, but more of an adverb. We see certain behavior as rational, no matter what its source, and our system of rules derives from finding patterns in what we see as rational.

''Multiple'' tests of artificial-intelligence efficacy are needed because, "just as there is no single test of [[Athletics (physical culture)|athletic]] prowess, there cannot be one ultimate test of [[intelligence]]."  One such test, a "Construction Challenge", would test perception and physical action—"two important elements of intelligent behavior that were entirely absent from the original [[Turing test]]."  Another proposal has been to give machines the same standardized tests of science and other disciplines that schoolchildren take.  A so far insuperable stumbling block to artificial intelligence is an incapacity for reliable [[disambiguation]].  "[V]irtually every sentence [that people generate] is [[ambiguity|ambiguous]], often in multiple ways."  A prominent example is known as the "pronoun disambiguation problem":  a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a [[pronoun]] in a sentence—such as "he", "she" or "it"—refers.

[[Image:Justus Lipsius - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|Justus Lipsius]]

'''Justus Lipsius''' ('''Joest Lips''' or '''Joost Lips'''; 18 October 1547 – 23 March 1606)&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Lipsius, Justus |volume=16|page=743|short=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[philologist]], [[philosopher]] and [[Christian humanism|humanist]]. Lipsius wrote a series of works designed to revive ancient [[Stoicism]] in a form that would be compatible with [[Christianity]]. The most famous of these is ''[[De Constantia]]'' (''On Constancy''). His form of Stoicism influenced a number of contemporary thinkers, creating the [[intellectual history|intellectual movement]] of [[Neostoicism]]. He taught at the universities in [[Jena]], [[Leiden]] and [[Leuven]].

==Early life==
[[Image:Peter Paul Rubens 118.jpg|thumb|''[[The Four Philosophers]]'' (c. 1615. Oil on panel; 167 x 143 cm, [[Pitti Palace]], [[Florence]]). One of Lipsius's students was [[Philip Rubens]], the brother of the painter [[Peter Paul Rubens]]. In his friendship portrait of about 1615, the painter depicted himself, his brother, Lipsius and [[Jan van den Wouwer]], another pupil of Lipsius, (left to right) along with Lipsius' dog Mopsulus. A bust of Seneca behind the philosopher references his work, while the ruins of [[Rome]]'s [[Palatine Hill]] in the background further commemorate the classical influences. Rubens painted a similar friendship portrait while in [[Mantua]] around 1602 (now in the [[Wallraf-Richartz Museum]], [[Cologne]]) that also includes Lipsius.]]

Lipsius was born in [[Overijse]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] (in modern [[Belgium]]). His parents sent him early to the Jesuit college in [[Cologne]], but they feared that he might become a member of the [[Society of Jesus]], so when he was sixteen they removed him to the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Louvain]] in [[Leuven]].

The publication of his ''Variarum Lectionum Libri Tres'' (1567), which he dedicated to [[Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle|Cardinal Granvelle]], earned him an appointment as a Latin secretary, and a visit to [[Rome]] in the retinue of the cardinal. Here Lipsius remained for two years, devoting his spare time to the study of the Latin classics, collecting inscriptions and examining manuscripts in the [[Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana|Vatican]]. After he returned from Rome, he published a second volume of miscellaneous criticism (''Antiquarum Lectionum Libri Quinque'', 1575); compared with the ''Variae Lectiones'' of eight years earlier, it shows that he had advanced from the notion of purely [[conjectural emendation]] to that of emending by [[collation]].

==Academic career==
In 1570 he travelled through [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Bohemia]], where the [[University of Jena]] engaged him as a teacher for more than a year, a position which implied conformity to the [[Lutheran Church]]. On his way back to [[Leuven]], he stopped some time in [[Cologne]], where he must have comported himself as a [[Catholic]].

He then returned to Leuven, but the [[Eighty Years' War]] soon drove him to take refuge via [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]] to the Northern Netherlands, where, in 1579, the newly founded [[University of Leiden]] appointed him professor of history. He held the position of rector of the university for four terms and was a driving force behind the growth and innovation in the early years.&lt;ref name="WOI"&gt;Willem Otterspeer: ''Het bolwerk van de vrĳheid : de Leidse universiteit, 1575–1672''. Amsterdam : Uitgeverij Bert Bakker, 2000. {{ISBN|90-351-2240-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eleven years that Lipsius spent in [[Leiden]] were the period of his greatest productivity.  It was during this time that he prepared his [[Lucius Annaeus Seneca|Seneca]], and perfected, in successive editions, his [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]], and brought out a series of other works. Some were pure scholarship, some were collections from classical authors, and others were of general interest. One of this latter class was a treatise on politics (''Politicorum Libri Sex'', 1589), in which he showed that, though a public teacher in a country which professed toleration, he had not departed from the state maxims of [[Duke of Alva|Alva]] and [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]. He wrote that a government should recognize only one religion, and extirpate dissent by fire and sword. This avowal exposed him to attacks, but the prudent authorities of Leiden saved him, by prevailing upon him to publish a declaration that his expression ''Ure, seca'' ("Burn and carve") was a metaphor for a vigorous treatment.

==Later life==
[[Image:2006 Belgium 10 Lipsius Justus front.JPG|160px|thumb|The [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Belgium)#2006 coinage|Justus Lipsius Commemorative Coin]]]]
In the spring of 1590, leaving Leiden under pretext of taking the waters in [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], he went to [[Mainz]], where he reconciled with the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. This event deeply interested the Catholic world, and invitations from the courts and universities of [[Italy]], [[Austria]] and [[Spain]] poured in on Lipsius. But he preferred to remain in his own country, and he finally settled in Leuven, as professor of Latin in the [[Collegium Trilingue|Collegium Buslidianum]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

He was not expected to teach, and appointments as [[privy council|privy councillor]] and [[historiographer royal]] to King Philip II of Spain eked out his trifling stipend. He continued to publish dissertations as before, the chief being his ''De militia romana'' (1595) and his ''Lovanium'' (1605), intended as an introduction to a general history of Brabant.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Lipsius died in [[Leuven]].

==Legacy==
The former headquarters of the [[European Council]] (2004-2017) and the [[Council of the European Union]] (1995-2017), the [[Justus Lipsius building]], bears his name, having been constructed over the site of ''Rue Juste Lipse'', which linked ''[[Rue Belliard]]'' to ''[[Rue de la Loi]]'' in the [[Brussels and the European Union|European Quarter]] of [[Brussels]]. The building is still used by both institutions for offices and low-level meetings and so ''Justus Lipsius'' features heavily in the EU-lexicon.

In 2006, he was selected to appear on the 10 euro [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Belgium)#2006 coinage|Justus Lipsius Silver commemorative Coin]], minted by Belgium. The reverse side of the coin shows his portrait together with the years of his life (1547–1606).

==Political thinking==
The German historian Gerhard Oestreich has argued that Lipsius's ideas about the ideal citizen, a man who acts according to reason, is answerable to himself, is in control of his emotions, and is ready to fight, had found wide acceptance in the turbulent times of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. The Lipsian view, translated to politics, would have been at the basis of rationalisation of the state and its apparatus of government, autocratic rule by the prince, discipline dispensed to subjects, and strong military defence. The principles would have laid the foundation for military revolution that transformed first European warfare and then the internal organisation of the European states themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Oestreich, G: ''Neostoicism &amp; the Early Modern State'', Cambridge University press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;  These conclusions of Oestreich have met with some scepticism in the academic community, and the notion that Lipsius' political ideas had a decisive influence on political developments and military reforms in the [[Dutch Republic]] has been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s9737.pdf Chapter 1.  Justus Lipsius and the Post-Machiavellian Prince], in: Christopher Brooke, ''Philosophic Pride: Stoicism and Political Thought from Lipsius to Rousseau'', Princeton University Press, 2012, p. 12-36&lt;/ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''''LPH'''''; {{Lang-de|Vorlesungen über die Philosophie der Weltgeschichte}}, '''''VPW'''''), is a major work by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831), originally given as lectures at the [[University of Berlin]] in 1822, 1828, and 1830.  It presents [[History|world history]] in terms of the Hegelian philosophy in order to show that history follows the dictates of [[reason]] and that the natural progress of history is due to the outworking of [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute spirit]].

The text was originally published in 1837 by the editor [[Eduard Gans]], six years after Hegel's death, utilizing Hegel's own lecture notes as well as those found that were written by his students. A second German edition was compiled by Hegel's son, [[Karl von Hegel|Karl]], in 1840. A third German edition, edited by [[Georg Lasson]], was published in 1917.

==Themes==

===Written history===
Hegel begins by distinguishing three methods or modes of doing history: Original History, Reflective History and Philosophical History.

Original history is like that of [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]], these are almost contemporaneous writings limited to deeds, events and states of society which they had before their very eyes and whose culture they shared.

Reflective history is written at some temporal distance from the events or history considered.  However, for Hegel, this form of history has a tendency to impose the cultural prejudices and ideas of the historians' era upon the past history over which the historian reflects.

Philosophical history for Hegel, is the true way.  Hegel maintains that with philosophical history the historian must bracket his own preconceptions and go and find the overall sense and the driving ideas out of the very matter of the history considered.&lt;ref name="Lectures" /&gt;

===Spirit===
Hegel's lectures on the philosophy of world history are often used to introduce students to Hegel's philosophy, in part because Hegel's sometimes difficult style is muted in the lectures, and he discourses on accessible themes such as world events in order to explain his philosophy. Much of the work is spent defining and characterizing ''[[Geist]]'' or spirit.  The ''Geist'' is similar to the culture of people, and is constantly reworking itself to keep up with the changes of society, while at the same time working to produce those changes through what Hegel called the "cunning of reason" (''List der Vernunft'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Thinkers such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (1744–1803) and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] (1762–1814) had written on the concept and importance of world history and nationalism, and Hegel's philosophy continues this trend, while breaking away from an emphasis on nationalism and striving rather to grasp the full sweep of human cultural and intellectual history as a manifestation of spirit.

===Theodicy===
Hegel explicitly presents his lectures on the philosophy of history as a [[theodicy]], or a reconciliation of [[divine providence]] with the evils of history.&lt;ref&gt;''Lectures'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjfaimuprzoC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=theodicy p. 42].&lt;/ref&gt; This leads Hegel to consider the events of history in terms of universal reason: "That world history is governed by an ultimate design, that it is a rational process... this is a proposition whose truth we must assume; its proof lies in the study of world history itself, which is the image and enactment of reason."&lt;ref&gt;''Lectures'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjfaimuprzoC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=%22That+world+history+is+governed+by+an+ultimate+design,+that+it+is+a+rational+process%22%22this+is+a+proposition+whose+truth+we+must+assume;+its+proof+lies+in+the+study+of+world+history+itself,+which+is+the+image+and+enactment+of+reason.%22 p. 28].&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate design of the world is such that absolute spirit, here understood as [[God]], comes to know itself and fully become itself in and through the triumphs and tragedies of history. Hegel is clear that history does not produce happiness - "history is not the soil in which happiness grows. The periods of happiness in it are the blank pages of history";&lt;ref&gt;''Lectures'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjfaimuprzoC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=%22history+is+not+the+soil+in+which+happiness+grows.+The+periods+of+happiness+in+it+are+the+blank+pages+of+history%22 p. 79].&lt;/ref&gt; "History as the slaughter-bench" (''Geschichte Als Schlachtbank'')&lt;ref&gt;''The Hegel Dictionary'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=khvwPJMzNzMC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=%22slaughter-bench+of+history%22%22History+as+a+slaughter-bench%22Schlachtbank p. 218].&lt;/ref&gt; - and yet the aims of reason are accomplished. Hegel writes: "we must first of all know what the ultimate design of the world really is, and secondly, we must see that this design has been realized and that evil has not been able to maintain a position of equality beside it."&lt;ref&gt;''Lectures'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjfaimuprzoC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=%22we+must+first+of+all+know+what+the+ultimate+design+of+the+world+really+is,+and+secondly,+we+must+see+that+this+design+has+been+realised+and+that+evil+has+not+been+able+to+maintain+a+position+of+equality+beside+it.%22 p. 43].&lt;/ref&gt; To see the reason in history is to be able to account for the evil within it. He argued against the 'professional historians' of the day such as [[Leopold von Ranke|Ranke]]. Hegel points out that the understanding and consequently writing of history always relies on a framework. Hegel chose to openly admit and explain his framework rather than hide it as many historians choose to do.

===History===
According to Hegel, "World history... represents the development of the spirit's consciousness of its own [[Freedom of will|freedom]] and of the consequent realization of this freedom.".&lt;ref&gt;''Lectures'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjfaimuprzoC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=%22represents+the+development+of+the+spirit's+consciousness+of+its+own+freedom+and+of+the+consequent+realisation+of+this+freedom.%22 p. 138].&lt;/ref&gt; This realization is seen by studying the various cultures that have developed over the millennia, and trying to understand the way that freedom has worked itself out through them. Hegel's account of history begins with ancient cultures as he understood them. His account of the civilizations relied upon 19th century European scholarship, and contains an unavoidable [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] bias. At the same time, the developmental nature of Hegel's philosophy meant that rather than simply deprecating ancient civilizations and non-European cultures, he saw them as necessary (if incomplete or underdeveloped) steps in the outworking of absolute spirit. Hegel's lectures on the philosophy of history contain one of his most well-known and controversial claims about the notion of freedom:

&lt;blockquote&gt;World history is the record of the spirit's efforts to attain knowledge of what it is in itself. The [[Persian Empire|Orientals]] do not know that the spirit or man as such are free in themselves. And because they do not know that, they are not themselves free. They only know that '''One''' is free.... The consciousness of freedom first awoke among the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], and they were accordingly free; but, like the Romans, they only knew that '''Some''', and not all men as such, are free.... The [[Germans#Middle Ages|Germanic nations]], with the rise of [[Christianity]], were the first to realize that '''All''' men are by nature free, and that freedom of spirit is his very essence.&lt;ref&gt;''Lectures'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjfaimuprzoC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=%22World+history+is+the+record+of+the+spirit's+efforts+to+attain+knowledge+of+what+it+is+in+itself.+The+Orientals+do+not+know+that+the+spirit+or+man+as+such+are+free+in+themselves.+And+because+they+do+not+know+that,+they+are+not+themselves+free.+They+only+know+that+One+is+free.%22%22The+consciousness+of+freedom+first+awoke+among+the+Greeks,+and+they+were+accordingly+free;+but,+like+the+Romans,+they+only+knew+that+Some,+and+not+all+men+as+such,+are+free%22%22The+Germanic+nations,+with+the+rise+of+Christianity,+were+the+first+to+realize+that+All+men+are+by+nature+free,+and+that+freedom+of+spirit+is+his+very+essence.%22 p. 54].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, Hegel maintains that the consciousness of freedom in history moves from [[despotism]], to a sense that freedom is a privilege of a few, to a robust notion that humanity is free in and of itself. Hegel believes that the spirit of human freedom is best nurtured within a [[constitutional monarchy]] in which the monarch embodies the spirit and desires of the governed, and his reading of history locates the rise of such forms of government in the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic nations]] of, for example, the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Prussia]] after the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Hegel's "one, some, and all" proposition follows the basic geographical metaphor Hegel takes throughout his philosophy of history, namely, "World history travels from [[Eastern world|east]] to [[Western world|west]]; for [[Europe]] is the absolute end of history, just as [[Middle East|Asia]] is the beginning."&lt;ref&gt;''Lectures'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjfaimuprzoC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=%22World+history+travels+from+east+to+west;+for+Europe+is+the+absolute+end+of+history,+just+as+Asia+is+the+beginning.%22 p. 197].&lt;/ref&gt; When referring to the east, Hegel generally has in mind the historical cultures of [[Persia]], though at times he does reference [[China]] and spends a great deal of space discussing [[India]] and [[Indian religions]]. 
However he also said that the view of history (including his own) should be open to change based on the 'empirical facts' available.

==The text==

===German editions===
Because of the nature of the text (collections of edited lecture notes), critical editions were slow in forthcoming. The standard German edition for many years was the manuscript of Hegel's son Karl Hegel, published in 1840. The German edition produced by Eva Moldenhauer and Karl Michel (1986)&lt;ref name="editions2"&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Moldenhauer
 |first=Eva and Karl Markus Michel (Ed.)
 |title=Vorlesungen über die Philosophie der Geschichte
 |year=1986
 |publisher=Suhrkamp Verlag
 |location=Frankfurt a.M.
 |language=German
 |isbn=3-51828212-3
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; essentially follows Karl Hegel's edition. The only critical edition in German of the text of the lectures is Georg Lasson's 4 vol. edition (1917–1920). This edition was published repeatedly (last in two volumes in 1980) by Felix Meiner Verlag, Hamburg. The long introduction was re-edited on the basis of Lasson's publication in 1955, by Johannes Hoffmeister.

===English editions===
No full English translation of the complete lectures has ever been produced. The first English translation was made from Karl Hegel's edition, which lacked much material discovered later. This translation, made by John Sibree (1857),&lt;ref name="editions4"&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Sibree
 |first=John (Ed. and Trans.)
 |title=The Philosophy of World History
 |year=1956

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is still the only English version which contains not only the Introduction, but the shorter body of the lectures according to Karl Hegel's 1840 manuscript. Though it is incomplete, this translation is often used by English speaking scholars and is prevalent in university classrooms in the English-speaking world.

An English translation of the Introduction to the lectures was produced by [[Robert S. Hartman]] (1953) which included an introduction and additional editorial footnotes.&lt;ref name="editions5"&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Hartman
 |first=Robert S. (Ed. and Trans.)

 |publisher=Prentice-Hall

 |isbn=0-02351320-9
 |LCCN=53004476
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartman produced this translation before Hoffmeister's critical edition was published, and it is quite short, only 95 pages.

An English translation of Hoffmeister's critical edition of the Introduction was produced in 1974 by H. B. Nisbet. This edition presents the full text of the Introduction to Karl Hegel manuscript, as well as all later additions included in the Hoffmeister edition of the Introduction. As such, it is the only critical edition of any portion of the lectures available in English. No translation of the full edition of the lectures following Lasson has yet been produced.

'''Luce Irigaray''' ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|r|ɪ|ɡ|ə|r|eɪ}}; {{IPA-fr|iʁigaʁɛ|lang}}; born 3 May 1930) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]]-born [[France|French]] [[Feminism|feminist]], [[philosopher]], [[linguist]], [[Psycholinguistics|psycholinguist]], [[psychoanalytic theory|psychoanalyst]] and [[culture theory|cultural theorist]]. She is best known for her works ''Speculum of the Other Woman'' (1974) and ''This Sex Which Is Not One'' (1977). Presently, she is active in the Women's Movements in both France and Italy.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/irigaray/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Luce Irigaray received a bachelor's degree from the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|University of Louvain]] in 1954 and a master's degree from the same university in 1956 and taught at a high school in [[Brussels]] from 1956 to 1959.

In 1960 she moved to [[Paris]] to pursue a master's degree in Psychology from the [[University of Paris]], which she earned in 1961, she also received a [[specialist diploma]] in Psychopathology from the school in 1962. In 1968, she received a [[doctorate]] in Linguistics from [[Paris X Nanterre]]. Her thesis was titled ''Approche psycholinguistique du langage des déments''.

She completed a PhD in Linguistics in 1968 from the [[University of Vincennes in Saint-Denis]] (University of Paris VIII). Her dissertation on speech patterns of subjects suffering from dementia became her first book, ''Le langage des déments'', published in 1973. In 1974, she earned a second PhD in Philosophy.

In the 1960s, Irigaray started attending the psychoanalytic seminars of Jacques Lacan and joined the [[École Freudienne de Paris]] (Freudian School of Paris), directed by Lacan. She was expelled from this school in 1974 after the publication of her second doctoral thesis ([[doctorat d'État]]), ''Speculum of the Other Woman'' (''Speculum: La fonction de la femme dans le discours philosophique'', later retitled as ''Speculum: De l'autre femme''), which received much criticism from both the Lacanian and Freudian schools of psychoanalysis. This criticism brought her recognition. But she was removed from her position as an instructor at the University of Vincennes as well as ostracized from the Lacanian community.

She held a research post at the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] since 1964, where she is now a Director of Research in Philosophy. Her initial research focused on dementia patients, about whom she produced a study of the differences between the language of male and female patients.

Noted also is that in her writings, Irigaray has stated a concern that an interest in her biography would affect the interpretation of her ideas as the entrance of women into intellectual discussions has often also included the challenging of women's point of view based on biographical material. Her most extensive autobiographical statements thus far are gathered in Through Vegetal Being (co-authored with [[Michael Marder]]). Overall, she maintains the belief that biographical details pertaining to her personal life hold the possibility to be used against her within the male dominated educational establishment as a tool to discredit her work.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Luce-Irigaray&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works and publications==
Her first major book ''Speculum of the Other Woman,'' based on her second dissertation, was published in 1974, In ''Speculum,'' Irigaray engages in close analyses of phallocentrism in Western philosophy and psychoanalytic theory, analyzing texts by Freud, Hegel, Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, and Kant. The book's most cited essay, "The Blind Spot of an Old Dream," critiques Freud's lecture on femininity.

In 1977, Irigaray published ''This Sex Which is Not One'' (''Ce sexe qui n'en est pas un'') which was subsequently translated into English with that title and published in 1985, along with ''Speculum''. In addition to more commentary on psychoanalysis, including discussions of Lacan's work, ''This Sex Which is Not One'' also comments on political economy, drawing on structuralist writers such as Lévi-Strauss. For example, Irigaray argues that the phallic economy places women alongside signs and currency, since all forms of exchange are conducted exclusively between men. (See the essay "Women on the Market", which is Chapter Eight of ''This Sex Which Is Not One''.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ledpup |url=https://caringlabor.wordpress.com/2010/11/10/luce-irigaray-women-on-the-market/ |title=Luce Irigaray, "Women on the Market" &amp;#124; caring labor: an archive |publisher=Caringlabor.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irigaray draws upon [[Karl Marx]]’s [[Marxian economics|theory of capital and commodities]] to claim that women are exchanged between men in the same way as any other commodity is. She argues that our entire society is predicated on this exchange of women.  Her exchange value is determined by society, while her use value is her natural qualities.  Thus, a woman’s self is divided between her use and exchange values, and she is only desired for the exchange value. This system creates three types of women: the mother, who is all use value; the virgin, who is all exchange value; and the prostitute, who embodies both use and exchange value.&lt;ref name=Market&gt;Irigaray, L. (1985) "Women on the Market." in {{cite book | last1 = Rivkin | first1 = J. | last2 = Ryan | first2 = M. (eds) | title = Literary theory, an anthology | publisher = Blackwell | location = Malden, Mass | year = 1998 | pp = 799–811 | isbn = 9780631200291 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the same essay, "Women on the Market," Irigaray uses additional Marxist foundations to argue that women are in demand due to their perceived shortage and as a result, males seek "to have them all," or seek a surplus like the excess of commodity buying power, capital, that capitalists seek constantly.

Irigaray speculates thus that perhaps, "the way women are used matter less than their number." In this further analogy of women "on the market," understood through Marxist terms, Irigaray points out that women, like commodities, are moved between men based on their exchange value rather than just their use value, and the desire will always be surplus – making women almost seem like capital, in this case, to be accumulated. "As commodities, women are thus two things at once: utilitarian objects and bearers of value."&lt;ref name=Market/&gt;

==Themes==
Some of Irigaray's books are imaginary dialogues with significant contributors to Western philosophy, such as [[Nietzsche]] and [[Heidegger]]. However Irigaray also writes a significant body of work on [[Hegel]], [[Descartes]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]] and [[Levinas]], as well as [[Merleau-Ponty]]. She continued to conduct empirical studies about language in a variety of settings, researching the differences between the way men and women speak. This focus on sexual difference is the key characteristic of Irigaray's oeuvre, since she is seeking to provide a site from which a feminine language can eventuate.

==Criticism==
Many feminists criticize the perceived essentialist positions of Luce Irigaray.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Delphy, L'Ennemi principal, tome 2 : Penser le genre (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is much debate among scholars as to whether or not Irigaray's theory of sexual difference is, indeed, an essentialist one. The perception that Luce Irigaray's work is essentialist concentrates on her attention to sexual difference, taking this to constitute a rehearsal of heteronormative sexuality. As Helen Fielding states, the uneasiness among feminists about Irigaray’s discussion of masculinity and femininity does not so much reveal Irigaray’s heteronormative bias, but "arises out of an inherited cultural understanding [on the part of her critics] that posits nature as either unchanging organism or as matter that can be ordered, manipulated and inscribed upon. Hence the concern over essentialism is itself grounded in the binary thinking that preserves a hierarchy of...culture over nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fielding | first1 = H. | journal = Continental Philosophy Review | volume = 36 | pages = 1–26| doi = 10.1023/A:1025144306606 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = |title=Questioning nature: Irigaray, Heidegger and the potentiality of matter}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
W. A. Borody has criticised Luce Irigaray's phallogocentric argument as misrepresenting the history of philosophies of "indeterminateness" in the West. Luce Irigaray's  "black and white" claims that the masculine=determinateness and that the feminine=indeterminateness contain a degree of cultural and historical validity, but not when it is deployed to self-replicate a similar form of the gender-othering it originally sought to overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne A. Borody (1998) pp. 3, 5 Figuring the Phallogocentric Argument with Respect to the Classical Greek Philosophical Tradition Nebula: A Netzine of the Arts and Science, Vol. 13 (pp. 1–27) &lt;http://kenstange.com/nebula/feat013/feat013.html&gt;.
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]], in their book critiquing postmodern thought (''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'', 1997), criticize Luce Irigaray on several grounds. They say she regards [[mass-energy equivalence|E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] as a "sexed equation" because of their interpretation of her response to a question on the subject, for instance when she says "Is E=Mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; a sexed equation? Perhaps it is. Let us make the hypothesis that it is insofar as it privileges the [[speed of light]] over other speeds that are vitally necessary to us. What seems to me to indicate the possible sexed nature of the equation is not directly its uses by nuclear weapons, rather it is having privileged what goes the fastest."&lt;ref&gt;Irigaray, Luce. "Sujet de la science, sujet sexué?" pp.95-121 In: Sens et place des connaissances dans la société. Paris: Centre National de Recherche Scientifique. 1987. p.110.&lt;/ref&gt;  They also take issue with the assertion that [[fluid mechanics]] is unfairly neglected because it deals with "feminine" [[fluid]]s in contrast to "masculine" [[Solid mechanics|rigid mechanics]]. In a review of Sokal and Bricmont's book, [[Richard Dawkins]]&lt;ref name="Dawkins_review"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sokal | first = Alan | title = Intellectual impostures : postmodern philosophers' abuse of science | publisher = Profile Books | location = London | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781861976314 }} cited in Dawkins, R. "Postmodernism disrobed", ''Nature'' (journal), vol. 394, pp. 141-143, 9 July 1998. Retrieved 18 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that, "You don't have to be a physicist to smell out the daffy absurdity of this kind of argument (...), but it helps to have Sokal and Bricmont on hand to tell us the real reason why turbulent flow is a hard problem (the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] are difficult to solve)."

In the [[science]] of [[biology]], a '''mechanism''' is a system of causally interacting parts and processes that produce one or more effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mechanisms in Science|last1=Craver|first1=Carl |last2= Tabery|first2= James|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2017 Edition)|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-mechanisms/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientists]] explain [[phenomena]] by describing mechanisms that could produce the phenomena. For example, [[natural selection]] is a mechanism of [[biological evolution]]; other mechanisms of evolution include [[genetic drift]], [[mutation]], and [[gene flow]].   In [[ecology]], mechanisms such as [[predation]] and host-parasite interactions produce change in [[ecological systems]]. In practice, no description of a mechanism is ever complete because not all details of the parts and processes of a mechanism are fully known. For example, natural selection is a mechanism of evolution that includes countless, inter-individual interactions with other individuals, components, and processes of the environment in which natural selection operates.

==Characterizations/ definitions==
Many characterizations/definitions of '''mechanisms''' in the [[philosophy of science]]/biology have been provided in the past decades. For example, one influential characterization of neuro- and molecular biological mechanisms is as follows: mechanisms are entities and activities organized such that they are productive of regular changes from start to termination conditions (Peter Machamer, [[Lindley Darden]], &amp; [[Carl Craver]] 2000; 'MDC' hereafter). Other characterizations have been proposed by [[Stuart Glennan]] (1996, 2002), who articulates an interactionist account of mechanisms, and [[William Bechtel]] (1993, 2006), who emphasizes parts and operations (cf. MDC).

The MDC characterization is as follows: mechanisms are entities and activities organized such that they are productive of changes from start conditions to termination conditions. There are three distinguishable aspects of this characterization:

;Ontic aspect
:The ontic constituency of biological mechanisms includes entities and activities.{{examples|date=November 2014}} Thus, the MDC conception postulates a dualistic ontology of mechanisms, where entities are substantial components, and activities are reified components of mechanisms. This augmented ontology increases the explanatory power of the MDC conception.

;Descriptive aspect
:Most descriptions of mechanisms (as found in the scientific literature) include specifications of the entities and activities involved, as well as the start and termination conditions. {{examples|date=November 2014}}This aspect is mostly limited to linear mechanisms, which have relatively unambiguous beginning and end points between which they produce their phenomenon, although it may be possible to arbitrarily select such points in cyclical mechanisms (e.g., the [[Krebs cycle]]).

;Epistemic aspect
:Mechanisms are dynamic producers of phenomena. MDC emphasize activities, which are causes that are reified. {{examples|date=November 2014}}It is because of activities that the MDC conception of mechanisms is able to capture the dynamicity of mechanisms as they bring about a phenomenon.

==Analysis==
Mechanisms in science/biology have reappeared as a subject of philosophical [[analysis]] and discussion in the last several decades because of a variety of factors, many of which relate to metascientific issues such as [[explanation]] and [[Causality|causation]]. For example, the decline of Covering Law (CL) models of explanation, e.g., Hempel's [[deductive-nomological model]], has stimulated interest how mechanisms might play an explanatory role in certain domains of [[science]], especially higher-level disciplines such as biology (i.e., neurobiology, molecular biology, neuroscience, and so on). This is not just because of the philosophical problem of giving some account of what "laws of nature," which CL models encounter, but also the incontrovertible fact that most biological phenomena are not characterizable in nomological terms (i.e., in terms of lawful relationships). For example, protein biosynthesis does not occur according to any law, and therefore, on the DN model, no explanation for the biosynthesis phenomenon could be given.

==Explanations==
Mechanistic explanations come in many forms. [[Wesley Salmon]] proposed what he called the "ontic" conception of explanation, which states that explanations are mechanisms and causal processes ''in the world''. There are two such kinds of explanation: ''etiological'' and ''constitutive''. Salmon focused primarily on etiological explanation, with respect to which one explains some phenomenon ''P'' by identifying its causes (and, thus, locating it within the causal structure of the world). Constitutive (or componential) explanation, on the other hand, involves describing the components of a mechanism ''M'' that is productive of (or causes) ''P.'' Indeed, whereas (a) [[Noam Chomsky]] differentiates between descriptive and explanatory adequacy, where the former is defined as the adequacy of a theory to account for at least all the items in the domain (which need explaining), and the latter as the adequacy of a theory to account for no more than those domain items, and (b) past philosophies of science differentiate between descriptions of phenomena and explanations of those phenomena, in the non-ontic context of mechanism literature, descriptions and explanations seem to be identical. This is to say, to explain a mechanism ''M'' is to describe it (specify its components, as well as background, enabling, and so on, conditions that constitute, in the case of a linear mechanism, its "start conditions").

{{Hinduism}}
'''Nama Japam''' or '''Nama Sankeertanam''' is the ''[[japa]]'' (repetition) or ''[[Sankirtana]]'' of ''nama'' (name) of the Almighty.  The devotee chooses ''[[Ishta-deva]]'' or ''[[Ishta devata]]'' (Sanskrit ''{{IAST|iṣṭa-deva(tā)}}'', literally "cherished [[Deva (Hinduism)|divinity]]" from ''iṣṭa'' "desired, liked, cherished" and ''[[devatā]]'' "godhead, divinity," or ''[[deva (Hinduism)|deva]]'' "deity") and picks up a name of the Ishta deva to repeatedly [[chant]] the name vocally or in the mind any time, anywhere.  Devotees can form a group and do sankeertanam or singing together of name of the Almighty.

[[Bhishma]] considered chanting of the ''[[Vishnu sahasranama]]'' the best and easiest of all dharmas, or the means to attain relief from all bondage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stephen-knapp.com/thousand_names_of_the_supreme.htm "Thousand Names of the Supreme"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adi Sankaracharya]], the [[Advaita]] enlightened master, in verse 27 of his hymn, [[Bhaja Govindam]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kamakoti.org/shlokas/kshlok19.htm Bhaja Govindam: kamakoti.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; said that the [[Gita]] and Vishnu sahasranama should be chanted and the form of the Lord of [[Lakshmi]]-Narayana should always be meditated on. He also said that the Sahasranama bestowed all noble virtues on those who chanted it.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2005/12/16/stories/2005121603040200.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=On the Buddha in verse | date=December 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sri Krishna has mentioned in Srimad [[Bhagavad Gita]], that He resides in the hearts of those who chant and sing His namas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6255">[[Monsignor|Mons.]] ThDr. '''Oto Mádr''', [[Honorary degree|dr. h. c.]] (15 February 1917 – 27 February 2011) was a Czech [[Roman Catholic]] priest, [[theologian]], university professor, long-time [[political prisoner]] and the chief editor of ''Theological Texts'' ({{lang-cs|Teologické texty}}).

== Life ==
Mádr studied at the Archbishop's high school in the [[Bubeneč]] district of Prague, before continuing his education at the [[Charles University]] School of Theology (1936–1939). He was ordained as a priest in 1942 and began as a parish priest. After the end of [[World War II]], he continued his study of [[Ethics in religion#Christian ethics|moral theology]] at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University|Gregorian University in Rome]] (1948–1949). He then returned to [[Czechoslovakia]], where he was awarded the title of [[Doctor of Theology]] for his study on the works of [[Francisco Suárez]]. He remained active in the management of his parish, but also worked as a high-school teacher and was a prominent figure in the circles of [[Catholic Action]]. He was a youth pastor in the church of The Most Holy Saviour in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1185258379-cesty-viry/312298380030004/video/%20 Towards the fullness of life "''K plnosti života''"] – TV documentary from the cycle Paths of faith ("Cesty víry") on Oto Mádr (11 March 2012, time 5:20)&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested in May 1951 and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] for alleged [[espionage]] for the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and organization of illegal religious activity, in a [[miscarriage of justice]].

After release on probation in 1966, he worked in various blue-collar jobs. He returned briefly in 1968 to the Charles University School of Theology and was fully [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] in 1970 (his rehabilitation was cancelled in 1975, and renewed in 1990). He was sent away to a parish in the border areas in 1970 ([[Dolní Žandov]] near [[Cheb]]), and he returned to Prague only as a pensioner in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oto-madr.cz/Zivot-v-datech|title=His life in dates|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, he did not retire from his theological work, and was one of the main organizers of the Catholic [[samizdat]]. He continued in his collaboration with exiles, maintained relationships with foreign visitors, and participated in the preparation of secretly ordained priests and in the organization of theological colloquia at home. He was one of the main advisers to [[František Tomášek]] (from 1968), writing a couple of fundamental texts for him, which Tomášek published under his name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ustrcr.cz/data/pdf/pamet-dejiny/pad1102/73-87.pdf Petr Blažek: Operation “Teolog”], 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Mádr published the journal ''Theological Texts'' ({{lang-cs|Teologické texty}}) from 1978, first as samizdat, then after the [[Velvet Revolution]] as a normal [[revue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teologicketexty.cz/casopis/autori/autor/Madr-Oto.html|title=Articles in the revue Teologické texty authored by Oto Mádr|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published tens of books in samizdat, mainly translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oto-madr.cz/Bibliografie|title=The official bibliography of Oto Mádr|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to the Charles University School of Theology with his friend Josef Zvěřina in 1990, but after Zvěřina's death the same year he was again removed, returning permanently only after a change in the leadership of the school in 2002. He received an [[honorary degree]] in 1991 from the [[University of Bonn]] and was awarded the [[Order of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] III. class in 1997. He was a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of the [[Vyšehrad Chapter|Vyšehrad chapter]] from 1999.

==His views==
In 1903 he edited ''[[Problems of Idealism]]'' which included his essay "Нравственный идеализм в философии права" (Moral idealism in the philosophy of law). Novgorodtsev was a [[Neo-Kantian]] and considered [[natural law]] as providing a moral criterion for criticising and improving [[positive law]].&lt;ref name="GSE"/&gt; In The Crisis of Modern Legal Consciousness (1911), he declared that all ideas for resolving modern social and moral contradictions were Utopian. He criticised the theory of scientific socialism.&lt;ref name="GSE"/&gt; He rejected [[scientific socialism]] and viewed all proposals for resolving modern social and moral contradictions as Utopian.&lt;ref name="GSE"/&gt;

'''Pedro Domingo Murillo''' (September 17, 1757– January 29, 1810) was a patriot of [[Upper Peru]] who played a key role in [[Bolivian War of Independence|Bolivia's independence]].

==Biography==
On 17 September 1757, Pedro Domingo Murillo was born in the city of La Paz. His father, Juan Ciriaco Murillo, was from one of its elite families, whereas his mother Mary Ascencia Carasco was of native pedigree. Juan Ciriaco had been training for priesthood in the catholic church, becoming a priest soon after Pedro's birth. Juan took charge of his education. It is thought Pedro may have attended the Colegio Seminario de San Carlos, in La Paz. At the [[St Francis Xavier University of Chuquisaca]] (later renamed [[Sucre]]), Pedro then studied law, but left before completing. By age 21, he had married Olmedo Manuel de la Concha in [[Potosí]], the high-altitude silver mining city at the foot of ''[[Cerro Rico|Cerro de Potosí]].'' Within 3 years the family, with at least two children, had moved to [[Irupana]].

From the earliest colonial days, the control of upper Peru by the Spanish crown had been firm. Late 1780 saw the [[Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II]]. In helping to vanquish this Murillo distinguished himself, and was appointed Lieutenant of the Militia.

Within 5 years, Juan Ciriaco Murillo had died, leaving most of his fortune to Pedro's children. His paternal aunt, Catalina Felipe, filed a lawsuit disputing this. At first, this was defeated. However, in papers submitted to court, Murillo falsely claimed a degree in law.

This deception had been achieved with some cunning. First, Pedro abused the goodwill of a rector at [[St Francis Xavier University of Chuquisaca]]. The date set to take the examination is known only to the Attorney General of the colonial government, [[Real Audiencia]]. Murillo claimed his submission had been via the Notary Sebastian del Toro, who worked regularly for members of the [[Real Audiencia]]. The certificate had been submitted days ago, the day "forgotten." Though with no certificate, Murillo asserted he had performed brilliantly in the examination, and had obtained his law degree. A year later in [[La Paz]], Murillo was denounced as having forged his licence to practice law. Challenged by Judge Sebastian Segurola, a friend, to present the original certificate, Murillo simply disappeared. A search at his home revealed documents falsified in Murillo's handwriting. Forged by him had been the signatures of as many as four notaries, as they each subsequently attested.

In the case against his aunt, the truth surfaced. Murillo not only lost the case, but his falsely attested profession had also been in contempt of court. He had to flee the authorities. Pardoned by early 1789, he tried his hand in mining.

Concern arose throughout Spanish South America when French forces back in Spain, led by Bonaparte, forced the fall of Ferdinand VII; what seemed the usurping of the Spanish crown by Napoleon's brother Joseph. Memories also smoldered of the violent suppression 30 years earlier of grievances from indigenous communities in upper Peru. In 1805, Murillo was part of a group conspiring against the Spanish government, but was discovered and brought to trial.

Upper Peru regional government in Chuquisaca, the Real Audiencia of Charcas, became uneasy about the loyalties of the local governor. Supported by the faculty of the [[St Francis Xavier University of Chuquisaca]], they deposed him and formed a junta on 25 May 1809. With the King impeded from reigning, logic suggested the Indies should govern themselves. A self-determination movement kicked off with the incessant ringing of the bell of the St Francis Xavier Basilica in Chuquisaca (nowadays [[Sucre]]). Meanwhile, Murillo was plotting back in [[La Paz]], leading outright rebellion 16 July. At a self-appointed Junta Tuitiva ("protecting junta") there a few days later, Murillo demanded nothing less than the secession of upper Peru from the Spanish Empire. He is said to have claimed the revolution was 'igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to extinguish'. This touches on an unresolved point (see historiography at [[Chuquisaca Revolution]]). By some in [[Bolivia]] (but not in [[Ecuador]]) the moment is claimed as the spark that lit the Liberation of South America from Spain (''Primer grito libertario'').

To suppress what had become a serious insurrection, royalist troops were despatched, some from the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] and others from [[Buenos Aires]]. Though some regiments comprising natives refused to intervene against an avowedly patriotic movement, the uprising was repressed. Murillo had to flee, but was captured. He was hanged, along with others, on 29 January 1810, where he made the following statement:

{{quote|Compatriots, I die, but tyrants won't be able to extinguish the torch I ignited. Long live freedom!&lt;ref&gt;"Compatriotas, yo muero, pero la tea que he encendido ya no podrán extinguirla los tiranos. ¡Viva la libertad! (Murillo) - Cabrera, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Every 16 July in [[La Paz]], the local populace honours what are regarded as patriotic deeds of 1809. A regional celebration begins when the various national and local authorities collaborate to light the Torch of Liberty at what is dubbed the house of the martyr. There follows a parade through central [[La Paz]]. Their own torches  symbolising the one Murillo claimed to have ignited, citizens form the "Parade of Torches."

'''Francis Sheldon Hackney''' (December 5, 1933 – September 12, 2013) was a prominent U.S. [[educator]]. He was the Boies Professor of [[United States History]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

==Early life==
Hackney was born in Birmingham, Alabama in 1933.  After graduating from [[Vanderbilt University]], Hackney earned his Ph.D. in American History at [[Yale University]], where he worked with eminent Southern historian [[C. Vann Woodward]]. He subsequently served in the Navy for five years.

==Career==
Hackney began his career as a lecturer in history at [[Princeton University]]. There, he taught in an Upward Bound program for disadvantaged students and played a role in the creation of the university's African American Studies program. While at Princeton, he moved into administration, serving as the provost from 1972 to 1975. 

From 1975 to 1980, Hackney was the president of [[Tulane University]]. At Tulane, Hackney was best known for approving the November 1979 decision to tear down [[Tulane Stadium]], the on-campus home of the [[Tulane Green Wave football|Green Wave football]] team from 1926 through 1974. The Wave moved to the [[Louisiana Superdome]] upon its completion in August 1975. Tulane Stadium stood vacant for nearly five years after Tulane and the [[National Football League|NFL's]] [[New Orleans Saints]] played their final games there, hosting high school football games and an ill-fated [[ZZ Top]] concert in 1976.

Hackney was president of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] from 1981 to 1993. He was also the Chairman of the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) from 1993 to 1997, appointed by [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]]. His defining initiative in the job was his first: "A National Conversation on American Pluralism and Identity," a project that helped finance and shape about 1,400 public meetings from 1994 to 1997.

Hackney specialized in the history of the American South since the Civil War. He had in an interest in American utopias and other social movements with an emphasis on the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and the 1960s. Among the articles and books on history that Hackney published, ''Populism to Progressivism in Alabama'' won the Albert J. Beveridge Award of the [[American Historical Association]]. [http://www.newsouthbooks.com/bkpgs/detailtitle.php?isbn_solid=1588382974 Dixie Redux: Essays in Honor of Sheldon Hackney], an edited collection of essays authored by his former students and collaborators will be released in November 2013.

Hackney was credited at the University of Pennsylvania with raising undergraduate minority enrollment from 13 to 30 percent and with increasing the endowment from about $160 million to $1 billion.  Towards the end of his tenure, there was the so-called [[Water buffalo incident]], a controversial affair involving a student charged with racial harassment that raised issues involving free speech and university judicial procedures nationally. In particular, Hackney's role in the incident was a subject of his 1993 Senate confirmation hearings for the NEH appointment. Hackney's memoir about the turmoil of his confirmation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hackney|first=Sheldon|authorlink=Sheldon Hackney|title=The Politics of Presidential Appointment: A Memoir of the Culture War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FbtIAQAAQBAJ|publisher=NewSouth Books|isbn=978-1-58838-068-5|page=101|chapter=Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ''The Politics of Presidential Appointment: A Memoir of the Culture War'' {{ISBN|1-58838-068-8}}, was published in 2002.  During his confirmation, critics derided him as the "pope of political correctness."  "I resent bitterly being slandered by slogan", Dr. Hackney told the Senate committee. "I am not just a cardboard figure. I am someone who has spent years defending free speech, and I will do that at NEH as well." He was confirmed, 76 to 23, and assumed the job previously held by Lynne Cheney.

==Personal life and death==
Hackney was the son-in-law of [[Virginia Durr|Virginia]] and [[Clifford Durr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mvtimes.com/calendar/2007/09/06/sheldon_hackney.php |title=The Martha's Vineyard Times: Gentleman &amp; Scholar Sheldon Hackney |publisher=Mvtimes.com |date=2007-09-06 |accessdate=2013-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617054109/http://www.mvtimes.com/calendar/2007/09/06/sheldon_hackney.php |archivedate=2013-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hackney died at [[Martha's Vineyard]], Massachusetts in 2013, aged 79. He had [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/obituaries/la-me-sheldon-hackney-20130915,0,4600244.story |title=Sheldon Hackney dies at 79; educator chaired endowment for humanities |publisher=latimes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Summum Pyramid SE 20030406.jpg|thumb|right|The Summum Pyramid]]

'''Summum''' is a religion and [[philosophy]] that began in 1975 as a result of American citizen [[Claude Nowell|Claude "Corky" Nowell's]] claimed encounter with beings he described as "Summa Individuals". According to Nowell, these beings presented him with concepts regarding the nature of creation, concepts that have always existed and are continually re-introduced to humankind by advanced beings who work along the pathways of creation. As a result of his experience, Nowell founded Summum in order to share the "gift" he received with others.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1980, as a reflection of his newfound path, he changed his name to [[summum bonum|Summum Bonum]] Amon Ra,&lt;ref&gt;

Summum religious practices draw upon both [[Ancient Egyptian religion]] and the Hebrew prophet [[Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;

== &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Basis of the philosophy ==

[[File:Summum nothing and possibility.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Summum sign: "The grand principle of creation is: 'Nothing and possibility come in and out of bond infinite times in a finite moment.'"]]

Summum's philosophy stems from what it considers to be principles of nature that cannot be attributed to any person.&lt;ref name="SummumBook"&gt;
{{cite book| last =Ra| first =Summum Bonum Amen| authorlink =| editor =| others =| title =SUMMUM: Sealed Except to the Open Mind| origyear =1975| month =| url =http://www.summum.us/philosophy/ebook/ebook.htm| accessdate =May 26, 2006| edition =| date =| year =2004| publisher =Summum| location =Salt Lake City| language =| doi =| pages =| chapter =| chapterurl =| quote =| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060626083953/http://www.summum.us/philosophy/ebook/ebook.htm| archivedate =June 26, 2006| df =mdy-all}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
These principles flower in different forms and were outlined before in the writings of ''[[Kybalion|The Kybalion]]'' first published in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
But Summum, considering ''The Kybalion'' incomplete and antiquated, rewrote the book after it entered the [[public domain]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The new [[derivative work]] utilized a more modern language and incorporated the new information said to have been presented by Ra to the Summa Individuals. Included in that information is an explanation and description of how creation came about. The rewrite resulted in a book published by Summum entitled ''SUMMUM: Sealed Except to the Open Mind'', and it provides an outline of the group's philosophy. The basis of the philosophy is the "Grand Principle of Creation" that states, "[[Nothing]] and [[Subjunctive possibility|Possibility]] come in and out of bond infinite times in a finite moment". The principle of creation generates the totality of existence which the Summum philosophy refers to as "SUMMUM", and from this master principle emanate "Seven Summum Principles" known as Psychokinesis, Correspondence, Vibration, Opposition, Rhythm, Cause and Effect, and Gender.&lt;ref name="SummumBook" /&gt;

Summum states that its teachings are the same as the teachings of Gnostic Christianity and maintains that knowledge does not come from things such as the intellect or obedience or faith, but from revelatory experience.&lt;ref name="GnosticChristianity"&gt;

| accessdate = May 11, 2007
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Summum teaches the "Systematic Law of Learning" which explains that knowledge is attained through questioning and experience.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Summum, devotion and spiritual practice leads to revelatory experience, and that was the basis of the authentic teachings of Jesus.&lt;ref name="GnosticChristianity" /&gt;

== Etymology and philosophical meaning ==

The word "summum" is Latin and is the neuter form of "summus" which means "highest".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=summum%20bonum "summum bonum." The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language Fourth Edition 2000. Dictionary.com. 26 May 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of the Summum philosophy, "summum" means "the sum total of all creation".&lt;ref name="AboutSummum"&gt;
{{cite web
| last =
| first =
| authorlink = 
| date = 
| url = http://www.summum.us/about/
| title = About Summum
| format =
| work =
| pages =
| publisher = Summum
| accessdate = May 26, 2006
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Summum appears to distinguish between "Summum" and "SUMMUM" in that "Summum" is the name of an organization and philosophy while "SUMMUM" is a name given to the totality of existence.&lt;ref name="SummumBook"/&gt;

== Meditation ==

Practice of the religion involves [[meditation]] upon the aspect of creation that is within one's self. Summum believes that within all created things is an [[essence]] which is the [[spirit]] of the creator, and that the more one directs his or her attention to this indwelling spirit, the more one realizes its existence and moves along the lines of [[spirituality|spiritual]] progression, developing "spiritual Psychokinesis".&lt;ref name="SummumBook" /&gt; It appears that there is no recognized [[deity]] per se in the philosophy, but rather that people are all part of the mind of the [[universe]] and that the universe collectively constitutes something great and worthy of study and meditation.

According to Summum, our mental states dictate our sense of harmony and disharmony, and the resulting experiences become part of our memories that then hold us captive.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nectar Publications ==

Summum produces "Nectar Publications", which are wines used in the meditation practices that Summum teaches. The nectars are made inside the Summum Pyramid, and according to Summum are imbued with resonations that contain spiritual concepts. Summum has made a number of different types of nectars, each containing its own "message". A small amount of nectar is consumed prior to meditation, and the alcohol is said to carry the resonations across the [[blood–brain barrier]] where they are released in the brain. [[Perception]] of the nectars' effects is said to depend upon the [[awareness]] of the person using them.&lt;ref name="nectars"&gt;
{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| date =| url =http://www.summum.us/nectars/publications.shtml| title =The Summum Nectar Publications| work =| pages =| publisher =Summum| accessdate =May 28, 2006| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060716200843/http://www.summum.us/nectars/publications.shtml| archivedate =July 16, 2006| df =mdy-all}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Governmental authorities consider the nectars to be [[wine]] and required that Summum obtain a winery license in order to make them. Summum is Utah's first federally bonded winery.&lt;ref name="nectars"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mummification ==

[[File:Cat Mummification by Summum.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A cat being mummified by Summum]]

Summum practices "Modern [[mummy|Mummification]]" and "Transference" as a means to guide one's essence to a greater destination following the death of the body.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Summum is a [[501(c)|501(c)(3)]] non-profit [[corporation sole]] that was granted a religious exemption from the [[IRS]] for its mummification service.&lt;ref name="AboutSummum"/&gt; The service is available to anyone for spiritual reasons and is also offered for pets. Summum does request and accept donations.&lt;ref&gt;

The first person to undergo the mummification process was Nowell himself, who died in January 2008. His body is encased inside a bronze [[wikt:mummiform |mummiform]] [[casket]] that is covered in gold and stands inside the group's [[pyramid]].&lt;ref name="CNNBeliefBlog"&gt;

== Participants ==

According to its founder, over 250,000 people worldwide have "received" Summum instruction.  As the organization does not keep formal membership records, this figure is based on the number of bottles of wine it has distributed.&lt;ref name="APSummumStory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="APNews"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ten Commandments ==

Summum contends that the principles and nature of creation are continuously re-introduced to humankind by evolved beings.&lt;ref name="SummumBook"/&gt; The group holds that in one such case, [[Moses]] in the Old Testament was given both a "lower" and "higher" knowledge from a divine being. The lower knowledge was embodied in the more widely known [[Ten Commandments]], while the higher was expressed in what Summum refers to as the "Seven Aphorisms".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.summum.us/philosophy/principles.shtml Full text of the Seven Aphorisms]&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Summum, when Moses first descended from Mount Sinai, he had with him the higher law inscribed on stone tablets. However, the undeveloped condition of the Israelites prevented them from understanding. Moses returned to Mount Sinai and returned with another set of tablets containing the lower law that was much easier for the people to comprehend. The higher law was only shared with a few capable of understanding its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
This appears to coincide with one of Summum's precepts that states, "The voice of wisdom is silent, except to the OPEN MIND",&lt;ref name="SummumBook"/&gt; and in this aspect, Summum resembles an [[Esotericism|esoteric]] religious movement.

According to the group, the "Seven Aphorisms" are:&lt;ref&gt;

# SUMMUM is MIND, thought; the universe is a mental creation.
# As above, so below; as below, so above.
# Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates.
# Everything is dual; everything has an opposing point; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes bond; all truths are but partial truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.
# Everything flows out and in; everything has its season; all things rise and fall; the pendulum swing expresses itself in everything; the measure of the swing to the right is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates.
# Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause; everything happens according to Law; Chance is just a name for Law not recognized; there are many fields of causation, but nothing escapes the Law of Destiny.
# Gender is in everything; everything has its masculine and feminine principles; Gender manifests on all levels.

Summum followers have gained attention as of late in that they have proposed that their Seven Aphorisms be placed in public places alongside the [[Ten Commandments]], specifically in several locations in [[Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;

[[Christians]] and town fathers have objected, claiming that the Ten Commandments are of great historic significance to the United States, and as such are not solely a religious statement, whereas the seven aphorisms are a modern philosophy. Summum has prevailed in other litigation where the [[Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled that Summum was denied its right to free speech and governments had engaged in discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;

The governments in those cases elected to remove their Ten Commandments monument rather than allow Summum to erect its Seven Aphorisms monument.&lt;ref name="APNews"/&gt; However, [[Pleasant Grove, Utah]], was successful in getting the [[United States Supreme Court]] to hear their case. Their argument is that the acceptance of a monument is not an instance of a public forum where speakers may not be discriminated against, but rather a form of government speech that does not require neutral viewpoints.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPostNews"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 25, 2009, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously against Summum in the ''Pleasant Grove'' case. Justice [[Samuel Alito]], in his opinion for the court, asserted that a municipality's acceptance and acquisition of a privately funded permanent monument erected in a public park while refusing to accept other privately funded permanent memorials is a valid expression of governmental speech, which is permissible and not an unconstitutional interference with the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. According to Alito, "the display of a permanent monument in a public park" is perceived by an ordinary and reasonable observer to be an expression of values and ideas of the government, the owner of the park and the monument, even though the particular idea expressed by the monument is left to the interpretation of the individual observer. Alito made a clear distinction between forms of private speech in public parks, such as rallies and temporary holiday displays (Christmas trees and menorahs), and the government speech represented by permanent monuments. He opined that even long-winded speakers eventually go home with their leaflets and holiday displays are taken down; but permanent monuments endure and are obviously associated with their owners. Alito wrote, "cities and other jurisdictions take some care in accepting donated monuments." While Summum and its supporters attempted to persuade the Court that preventing governments from selecting monuments on the basis of content would be tenable, Justice Alito noted that such a situation would put government in the position of having to choose between accepting permanent monuments with conflicting messages that do not represent the values and ideals of the community, and removing all monuments from public space. As described by Alito, if the law accorded with Summum and its supporters, New York would have been required to accept a Statue of Autocracy from the German Empire or Imperial Russia when it accepted the Statue of Liberty from France.&lt;ref name="SLTrib"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In a companion case, Summum requested a monument of its Seven Aphorisms be placed next to a Ten Commandments monument in Roy Park, a public park in the city of [[Duchesne, Utah]]. Following the Supreme Court's ruling in ''Pleasant Grove v. Summum'', Summum claimed the ruling opened the door for a new challenge based on church-state separation claims. Unlike Pleasant Grove, the Duchesne Ten Commandments monument was the only one in the park. Duchesne decided to move the monument to the city cemetery to avoid continuing litigation, citing counsel from their attorney who said the solitary monument would establish a religion for the city. As a result of the monument's removal from the city park, Summum's lawsuit became [[Mootness|moot]] and was dismissed.&lt;ref name="DesNewsSummumDuchesne"&gt;{{cite news

== Summum Pyramid ==

The Summum Pyramid is a sanctuary and temple used by the organization of Summum for instruction in the Summum philosophy. It is located in Salt Lake City, Utah, and was built during 1977 to 1979. The [[pyramid]] is 40 feet long at the base, 26 feet high, and is oriented towards [[true north]] of the [[Earth]]. The structure also incorporates the [[Divine Proportion]], or Golden Ratio, in its design.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1821">'''Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir''' is the adoptive daughter of [[Simone de Beauvoir]]. She is a [[philosophy]] [[professor]].  The meeting between the two women was recounted in the book ''Tout compte fait'', which Beauvoir dedicated to her.

Le Bon was one of a number of young women that de Beauvoir and [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Jean-Paul Satre]] cared and provided for. The two met in 1960, when Le Bon was 17 and de Beauvoir was 57. The relationship between them was, in Le Bon's words, "carnal but not sexual".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/09/26/stand-by-your-man|title=Stand By Your Man|last=Menand|first=Louis|date=2005-09-19|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-12-17|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Beauvoir legally adopted Le Bon in 1980, making her the sole executor of her will.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After the death of Simone de Beauvoir in 1986, Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir published several volumes of letters:

*''Lettres à Sartre'' - an anthology of the letters between Simone de Beauvoir and Sartre
*''Lettres à [[Nelson Algren]]''
*''Correspondance croisée'' (Simone de Beauvoir and [[Jacques-Laurent Bost]])
*''Anne, ou quand prime le spirituel'' (republication of Simone's first novel)

It is one of ten [[short stories]] in the collection ''[[Tsutsumi Chūnagon Monogatari]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Riverside Counselor's Stories: Vernacular Fiction of Late Heian Japan |author=Backus, Robert L. |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |year=1985 |pages=xxii |isbn=0-8047-1260-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
The [[protagonist]] befriends insects, names her attendants after them, and engages in [[Japanese poetry|poetic exchanges]] involving furry caterpillars, leading to [[laughter]] on the part of others. Portrayed as even more [[Eccentricity (behaviour)|eccentric]] is her disregard for her [[Physical attractiveness|physical appearance]]: she leaves her hair [[Hairstyle|untrimmed]]; has [[depilation|unplucked]] eyebrows; neglects to [[Ohaguro|blacken her teeth]]; and allows herself to be seen by men. 'Oh, how regrettable! Why does she have such a weird mind'. When an incipient love affair comes to an end along with the tale it is of little surprise to any of the observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Riverside Counselor's Stories: Vernacular Fiction of Late Heian Japan |author=Backus, Robert L. |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |year=1985 |pages=41–69, esp. p.63 |isbn=0-8047-1260-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
[[Donald Keene]] has suggested that, while the [[Reader-response criticism|reader]] may be attracted by her independence of mind, the author was probably trying to [[satirize]] those with eccentric behaviour and unconventional tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Seeds in the Heart: Japanese Literature from Earliest Times to the Late Sixteenth Century]] |author=[[Donald Keene|Keene, Donald]] |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |year=1999 |page=542 |isbn=0-231-11441-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Backus argues that the modern reader may prefer her independence and naturalness to the "excessive artificiality of the Heian conception of feminine beauty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Riverside Counselor's Stories: Vernacular Fiction of Late Heian Japan |author=Backus, Robert L. |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |year=1985 |page=43 |isbn=0-8047-1260-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also draws parallels with the vernacular [[setsuwa]] tradition and anecdotes told of [[List of Daijō Daijin#Heian Period|Fujiwara Munesuke]] (1077–1162), the 'Bee-Keeping Minister', who gave his favourites names such as "Long Legs", "Short Horns", and "Speckled Wings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Riverside Counselor's Stories: Vernacular Fiction of Late Heian Japan |author=Backus, Robert L. |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |year=1985 |pages=45f. |isbn=0-8047-1260-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michele Marra also refers to Fujiwara Munesuke, again links the tale with setsuwa that similarly challenge [[Imperial Court in Kyoto|court]] orthodoxy, and suggests that the story may see [[Sacca|Buddhist truth]] preferred to the values of the [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara]] aristocracy at the end of the [[Heian period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Aesthetics of Discontent: Politics and Reclusion in Medieval Japanese Literature |author=Marra, Michele |publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]] |year=1991 |pages=63–69, esp. p. 69 |isbn=0-8248-1364-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life'''" was an essay by the philosopher [[William James]], which he first delivered as a lecture to the Yale Philosophical Club, in 1891. It was later included in the collection, ''The Will to Believe and other Essays in Popular Philosophy.'' 

He drew a distinction between three questions in [[ethics (philosophy)|ethics]]: [[psychological]], [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]], [[casuistry|casuistic]]. 

"The psychological question asks after the historical origin of our moral ideas and judgments; the metaphysical question asks what the very meaning of the words 'good,' 'ill,' and 'obligation' are; the casuistic question asks what is the measure of the various goods and ills which men recognize, so that the philosopher may settle the true order of human obligations."&lt;ref&gt;James, William. „The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life“. The Will to Believe and Other Essays in Popular Philosophy: Human Immortality. New York: Dover Publications, 1956, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The psychological question==
As James sees it, the psychological question is whether human ideas of good and evil arise from "the association of [certain ideals] with act of simple bodily pleasures and reliefs from pain."&lt;ref&gt;James (1956), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that some elements of our moral sentiment do have such a source, and that [[Jeremy Bentham]] and his followers have done the world a lasting service by pointing that out. 

But he doesn't believe that association and pleasure/pain calculus are adequate to account for the psychology of morality. One must also admit innate, brain-born ideas or tendencies.

In a famous passage that recalls some of [[Dostoyevsky]]'s work, James wrote that "if the hypothesis were offered of a world in which Messrs Fourier's and Bellamy's and Morris' utopias should all be outdone, and millions kept permanently happy on the one simple condition that a certain lost soul on the far-off edge of things should lead a life of lonely torture,"&lt;ref&gt;James (1956), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; most people would feel that the enjoyment of such a utopia would be a "hideous thing" at such a cost. That feeling, he infers, must be brain born. The passage was the inspiration for [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s short story "[[The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas]]&lt;ref&gt;Le Guin, Ursula K. (1973). [http://www.galvinfamily.org/philosophy_education/phil20/readings/leguin/omelas.htm "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712005652/http://www.galvinfamily.org/philosophy_education/phil20/readings/leguin/omelas.htm |date=2011-07-12 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; (Variations on a theme by William James)".

==The metaphysical question==
The gist of this section is the contention that to be good, something has to be desired, by some sentient being. 

A world of only rocks would have no good or bad. A world with one thinking being in it would have plenty of good and bad—some things would work out as that being wanted them, others wouldn't. It could even have moral conflict of a sort, as that one thinker may have trouble rendering his own ideals consistent with one another. 

From such considerations, James concludes that "claim" and "obligation" are two sides of the same coin. Without a claim actually made by some concrete person there can be no obligation, but there is obligation wherever there is a claim.

==The casuistic question==
But this resolution of the metaphysical question only makes the casuistic question (settling the true order of human obligations) seem hopelessly difficult. If everything that anyone could want of me, or that I could want from myself, be considered an obligation, then my obligations are hopelessly in conflict with one another. 

"The various ideals [operating in the world] have no common character apart from the fact that they are ideals. No single abstract principle can be so used as to yield to the philosopher anything like a scientifically accurate and genuinely useful casuistic scale." How, then, shall I make choices? how shall I live?

James' answer is that history is resolving this problem for us, and our task is to co-operate in the process by which it does so, by which apparently irreconciliable demands are reconciled over time. One might say, although the terminology would be foreign to him, that he found his [[ethics]] within a pluralist [[meta-ethics]].

'''Thomas Samuel Kuhn''' ({{IPAc-en|k|uː|n}}; July 18, 1922&amp;nbsp;– June 17, 1996) was an American [[physics|physicist]], [[history of science|historian]] and [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] whose controversial 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' was influential in both academic and popular circles, introducing the term ''[[paradigm shift]]'', which has since become an English-language idiom.

Kuhn made several notable claims concerning the progress of [[scientific knowledge]]: that scientific fields undergo periodic "paradigm shifts" rather than solely progressing in a linear and continuous way, and that these paradigm shifts open up new approaches to understanding what scientists would never have considered valid before; and that the notion of scientific truth, at any given moment, cannot be established solely by [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] criteria but is defined by a consensus of a [[sociology of scientific knowledge|scientific community]]. Competing paradigms are frequently [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurable]]; that is, they are competing and irreconcilable accounts of reality. Thus, our comprehension of science can never rely wholly upon "objectivity" alone. Science must account for subjective perspectives as well, since all objective conclusions are ultimately founded upon the subjective conditioning/worldview of its researchers and participants.

==Life==
Kuhn was born in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], to Samuel L. Kuhn, an industrial engineer, and Minette Stroock Kuhn, both Jewish. He graduated from [[Taft School|The Taft School]] in Watertown, CT, in 1940, where he became aware of his serious interest in mathematics and physics. He obtained his [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] degree in [[physics]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1943, where he also obtained [[Master of Science|MS]] and PhD degrees in physics in 1946 and 1949, respectively, under the supervision of [[John Hasbrouck Van Vleck|John Van Vleck]].&lt;ref&gt;The title of his doctoral thesis was ''The Cohesive Energy of Monovalent Metals as a Function of Their Atomic Quantum Defects'' {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} .&lt;/ref&gt; As he states in the first few pages of the preface to the second edition of ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', his three years of total academic freedom as a [[Harvard Junior Fellow]] were crucial in allowing him to switch from physics to the history and philosophy of science. He later taught a course in the history of science at Harvard from 1948 until 1956, at the suggestion of university president [[James Bryant Conant|James Conant]]. After leaving Harvard, Kuhn taught at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in both the philosophy department and the history department, being named Professor of the [[History of science]] in 1961. Kuhn interviewed and tape recorded Danish physicist [[Niels Bohr]] the day before Bohr's death.&lt;ref name='bohr'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/4517-5|title=Last interview with Niels Bohr by Thomas S.

Kuhn |date=November 17, 1962 |work=Oral History Transcript – Niels Bohr |publisher=Center for History of Physics |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Berkeley, he wrote and published (in 1962) his best known and most influential work:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Alexander Bird |title=Thomas Kuhn |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thomas-kuhn/ |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''. In 1964, he joined [[Princeton University]] as the M.&amp;nbsp;Taylor Pyne Professor of Philosophy and History of Science. He served as the president of the [[History of Science Society]] from 1969–70.&lt;ref&gt;The History of Science Society [http://www.hssonline.org/about/society_presidents.html "The Society: Past Presidents of the History of Science Society"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212134009/http://www.hssonline.org/about/society_presidents.html |date=December 12, 2013 }}. Retrieved December 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 he joined the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) as the [[Laurance Rockefeller|Laurance S. Rockefeller]] Professor of Philosophy, remaining there until 1991. In 1994 Kuhn was diagnosed with lung cancer. He died in 1996.

Thomas Kuhn was married twice, first to Kathryn Muhs with whom he had three children, then to Jehane Barton Burns (Jehane R. Kuhn).

==''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''==
{{Main|The Structure of Scientific Revolutions}}
''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (''SSR'') was originally printed as an article in the ''[[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]]'', published by the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In this book, Kuhn argued that science does not progress via a linear accumulation of new knowledge, but undergoes periodic revolutions, also called "[[paradigm shift]]s" (although he did not coin the phrase),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the nature of scientific inquiry within a particular field is abruptly transformed. In general, science is broken up into three distinct stages. Prescience, which lacks a central paradigm, comes first. This is followed by "[[normal science]]", when scientists attempt to enlarge the central paradigm by "puzzle-solving". Guided by the paradigm, normal science is extremely productive: "when the paradigm is successful, the profession will have solved problems that its members could scarcely have imagined and would never have undertaken without commitment to the paradigm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In regard to experimentation and collection of data with a view toward solving problems through the commitment to a paradigm, Kuhn states: "The operations and measurements that a scientist undertakes in the laboratory are not 'the given' of experience but rather 'the collected with diffculty.' They are not what the scientist sees—at least not before his research is well advanced and his attention focused. Rather, they are concrete indices to the content of more elementary perceptions, and as such they are selected for the close scrutiny of normal research only because they promise opportunity for the fruitful elaboration of an accepted paradigm. Far more clearly than the immediate experience from which they in part derive, operations and measurements are paradigm-determined. Science does not deal in all possible laboratory manipulations. Instead, it selects those relevant to the juxtaposition of a paradigm with the immediate experience that that paradigm has partially determined. As a result, scientists with different paradigms engage in different concrete laboratory manipulations."&lt;ref&gt;https://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of normal science, the failure of a result to conform to the paradigm is seen not as refuting the paradigm, but as the mistake of the researcher, contra [[Karl Popper|Popper's]] [[falsifiability]] criterion. As anomalous results build up, science reaches a ''crisis'', at which point a new paradigm, which subsumes the old results along with the anomalous results into one framework, is accepted. This is termed ''revolutionary science''.

In ''SSR'', Kuhn also argues that rival paradigms are [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurable]]—that is, it is not possible to understand one paradigm through the conceptual framework and terminology of another rival paradigm. For many critics, for example [[David Stove]] (''[[Popper and After]]'', 1982), this thesis seemed to entail that theory choice is fundamentally [[irrational]]: if rival theories cannot be directly compared, then one cannot make a rational choice as to which one is better. Whether Kuhn's views had such [[Relativism|relativistic]] consequences is the subject of much debate; Kuhn himself denied the accusation of [[relativism]] in the third edition of ''SSR'', and sought to clarify his views to avoid further misinterpretation. [[Freeman Dyson]] has quoted Kuhn as saying "I am not a Kuhnian!",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the [[relativism]] that some philosophers have developed based on his work.

The enormous impact of Kuhn's work can be measured in the changes it brought about in the vocabulary of the philosophy of science: besides "paradigm shift", Kuhn popularized the word "[[paradigm]]" itself from a term used in certain forms of [[linguistics]] and the work of [[Georg Lichtenberg]] to its current broader meaning, coined the term "[[normal science]]" to refer to the relatively routine, day-to-day work of scientists working within a paradigm, and was largely responsible for the use of the term "[[Paradigm shift|scientific revolutions]]" in the plural, taking place at widely different periods of time and in different disciplines, as opposed to a single [[scientific revolution]] in the late Renaissance. The frequent use of the phrase "paradigm shift" has made scientists more aware of and in many cases more receptive to paradigm changes, so that Kuhn's analysis of the evolution of scientific views has by itself influenced that evolution.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Kuhn's work has been extensively used in social science; for instance, in the [[post-positivist]]/[[positivist]] debate within [[International Relations]]. Kuhn is credited as a foundational force behind the post-[[Robert K. Merton|Mertonian]] [[sociology of scientific knowledge]]. Kuhn's work has also been used in the Arts and Humanities, such as by Matthew Edward Harris to distinguish between scientific and historical communities (such as political or religious groups): 'political-religious beliefs and opinions are not epistemologically the same as those pertaining to scientific theories'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Matthew|title=The notion of papal monarchy in the thirteenth century : the idea of paradigm in church history|year=2010|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|location=Lewiston, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-7734-1441-9|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because would-be scientists' worldviews are changed through rigorous training, through the engagement between what Kuhn calls 'exemplars' and the Global Paradigm. Kuhn's notions of paradigms and paradigm shifts have been influential in understanding the history of economic thought, for example the [[Keynesian revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ghanshyam Mehta, ''The Structure of the Keynesian Revolution'', London, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; and in debates in political science.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Alan Ryan]], "Paradigms Lost: How Oxford Escaped the Paradigm Wars of the 1960s and 1970s', in Christopher Hood, Desmond King, &amp; Gillian Peele, eds, ''Forging a Discipline'', Oxford University Press, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

A defense Kuhn gives against the objection that his account of science from ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' results in relativism can be found in an essay by Kuhn called "Objectivity, Value Judgment, and Theory Choice."&lt;ref name="Kuhn 1977 320–39"&gt;{{cite book
|last=Kuhn
|first=Thomas
|title=The Essential Tension: Selected Studies in Scientific Tradition and Change

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this essay, he reiterates five criteria from the penultimate chapter of ''SSR'' that determine (or help determine, more properly) theory choice:
# ''Accurate'' – empirically adequate with experimentation and observation
# ''Consistent'' – internally consistent, but also externally consistent with other theories
# ''Broad Scope'' – a theory's consequences should extend beyond that which it was initially designed to explain
# ''Simple'' – the simplest explanation, principally similar to [[Occam's razor]]
# ''Fruitful'' – a theory should disclose new phenomena or new relationships among phenomena

He then goes on to show how, although these criteria admittedly determine theory choice, they are imprecise in practice and relative to individual scientists.  According to Kuhn, "When scientists must choose between competing theories, two men fully committed to the same list of criteria for choice may nevertheless reach different conclusions."&lt;ref name="Kuhn 1977 320–39"/&gt; For this reason, the criteria still are not "objective" in the usual sense of the word because individual scientists reach different conclusions with the same criteria due to valuing one criterion over another or even adding additional criteria for selfish or other subjective reasons. Kuhn then goes on to say, "I am suggesting, of course, that the criteria of choice with which I began function not as rules, which determine choice, but as values, which influence it."&lt;ref name="Kuhn 1977 320–39"/&gt; Because Kuhn utilizes the history of science in his account of science, his criteria or values for theory choice are often understood as descriptive normative rules (or more properly, values) of theory choice for the scientific community rather than prescriptive normative rules in the usual sense of the word "criteria", although there are many varied interpretations of Kuhn's account of science.

==Polanyi–Kuhn debate==
Although they used different terminologies, both Kuhn and [[Michael Polanyi]] believed that scientists' subjective experiences made science a relativized discipline. Polanyi lectured on this topic for decades before Kuhn published ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''.

Supporters of Polanyi charged Kuhn with plagiarism, as it was known that Kuhn attended several of Polanyi's lectures, and that the two men had debated endlessly over [[epistemology]] before either had achieved fame. The charge of plagiarism is peculiar, for Kuhn had generously acknowledged Polanyi in the first edition of ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''.&lt;ref name=Kuhn44/&gt; Despite this intellectual alliance, Polanyi's work was constantly interpreted by others within the framework of Kuhn's paradigm shifts, much to Polanyi's (and Kuhn's) dismay.&lt;ref&gt;Moleski, Martin X. [http://www.missouriwestern.edu/orgs/polanyi/TAD%20WEB%20ARCHIVE/TAD33-2/TAD33-2-fnl-pg8-24-pdf.pdf Polanyi vs. Kuhn: Worldviews Apart.] The Polanyi Society. Missouri Western State University. Retrieved March 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award==
In honor of his legacy, the "Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award" is awarded by the [[American Chemical Society]] to speakers who present original views that are at odds with mainstream scientific understanding. The winner is selected based in the novelty of the viewpoint and its potential impact if it were to be widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://web2011.acscomp.org/awards/thomas-kuhn-paradigm-shift-award | title = Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award | publisher = [[American Chemical Society]] | accessdate = September 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
Kuhn was named a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim Fellow]] in 1954, and in 1982 was awarded the [[George Sarton Medal]] by the [[History of Science Society]]. He also received numerous honorary doctorates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10735">The '''United Nations Interpretation Service''' is a part of the Meetings and Publishing Division (MPD) of the UN's Department for General Assembly and Conference Management (DGACM). Its core function is to provide [[Language interpretation|interpretation]] from and into Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish for meetings held at [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations Headquarters]], and those at other locations which the department is responsible for servicing. Interpretation is essential to the inter-governmental bodies for the proper conduct and smooth functioning of their deliberations.&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;Abud-Krafft, Salome and Elena Howard. United Nations Interpretation Service: Information for Incoming Headquarters Staff. (Publisher: United Nations Department of General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services, New York: 2000), 2 May 2000, 15 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNIS&gt;[http://un-interpreters.org/index.html Interpreters of the United Nations, UN-Interpreters.org], retrieved on: 08 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and evolution==
The creation of the conference [[Language interpretation|interpreting]] service – and the interpreting profession itself – at the United Nations has a direct connection with the evolution of international [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] relations, the [[League of Nations]], the [[Nuremberg trials]], the [[History of the United Nations|founding of the United Nations]], and the birth of [[multilingualism]] within the United Nations itself.&lt;ref name=Baigorri&gt;[http://webeus.usal.es ''Interpreters at the United Nations: A History''] Baigorri-Jalón, Jesús. Barr, Anne (English translation from Spanish). Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca:2004, page 106. {{ISBN|84-7800-643-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Endrst/&gt;

===Early days of the interpreting profession===
Most of the early interpreters of the United Nations were natural [[Polyglotism|polyglot]]s who were uprooted by wars and revolutions. For years, the only criterion used to select potential interpreters was the knowledge of two international languages the interpreters had to communicate in. Polyglots were found mainly in privileged social groups, government employees and professionals in [[Colonialism|colonial]] empires, in militarily and diplomatically powerful nations, in political or ideological exiles, in those who leave their countries temporarily for academic purposes, and in children of couples who speak different languages.&lt;ref name=Baigorri/&gt;

After the 1960s, there was change in the sociological make-up of UN interpreters. The United Nations began recruiting and training potential interpreters who were [[Monolingualism|monolingual]] from birth but had learned and specialized in languages. This generation of interpreters did not come from privileged groups or complex migratory backgrounds.&lt;ref name=Baigorri/&gt;

In contrast with the early beginnings of the profession, there was also a progressive addition of women in the field of conference interpreting.&lt;ref name=Baigorri/&gt;

===Modern-day conference interpreting===
At the League of Nations and during the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|San Francisco Conference]] (1945) before the formal founding of the United Nations, the interpreters played a vital and visible role in meetings. In consecutive interpretation, conference interpreters spoke from the same dais as the original speakers, and the speaker stops periodically so that the interpreter can interpret what has just been said while the participants in the meeting viewed and listened to the consecutive interpreter. The conference interpreters were often exposed to selected or large audiences and the [[Mass media|media]].&lt;ref name=Baigorri/&gt;&lt;ref name=Endrst&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1309/is_n3_v28/ai_11547959/print "Interpreters: Inside the Glass Booth"], Endrst, Elsa B. ''The UN Chronicle'', United Nations Publications (1991), Gale Group (2004)], date retrieved: 28 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the late 1940s and the early 1950s, United Nations officials introduced simultaneous interpretation as a preferred method for the majority of UN meetings because it saved time and improved the quality of the output. Simultaneous interpreting – a mode that confined the interpreters in glass-encased booths aided with earpieces and microphones – arose in the 1920s and 1930s when American businessman [[Edward Filene]] and British engineer [[A. Gordon-Finlay]] developed simultaneous interpretation equipment with [[IBM]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Origins of Simultaneous Interpretation Equipment|url=http://www.infinitytranslations.com/simultaneous_interpretation_blog.html|publisher=Infinity Translation Services|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also used in the post-World War II Nazi war crime trials held in [[Nuremberg]], Germany.&lt;ref name=Baigorri/&gt;&lt;ref name=Endrst/&gt;

# The speaker talks to a "microphone discussion system" connected to a central system.
# The central control system distributes the signal to the audience that do not need interpretation and to the simultaneous interpreter.
# Audio consoles are placed in the interpretation booths. Interpreters receive the signal, and are still able to capture the environment of the meeting.
# The interpreter talks to his or her transmitter and the signal goes back to the central console.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc24.org/2001/issue05/story07/graph.html How The Translation System Works Arnone, Michael and Javier Ruiz.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4062">'''Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Klykov''' (Russian: Вячеслав Михайлович Клыков; 19 October 1939 — 2 June 2006) was a [[Russia]]n sculptor who specialized in public monuments to key figures of national history and culture.

He was born into a peasant family near [[Kursk]] and studied in the Surikov Art Institute in Moscow, matriculating in 1964. Klykov's bronze statues did not conform to the precepts of [[Socialist Realism]]. His playful sculptural decor for the Central Musical Theatre for Children (1979) made him famous. In the late 1980s Klykov turned to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] for inspiration and support. His public statue of [[Sergius of Radonezh]] in [[Radonezh]] (1987) was the first memorial installed in the Soviet Union without permission from the authorities.

Klykov's other high-profile commissions include the memorial and church on the [[Field of Prokhorovka]] (1995), the public statues of Sts. [[Cyril and Methodius]] on [[Slavyanskaya Square]] (1991) and [[Marshal Zhukov]] on [[Manezhnaya Square, Moscow|Manege Square]] (1995). He was also responsible for the statue of [[St. Vladimir]] in [[Kherson]] (1993) and several monuments to [[Nicholas II]], including the first one erected in Russia, in 1996, which was blown up by anti-monarchists on several occasions.

In the 1990s, Klykov created and ran the International Fund of Slavonic Literature and Culture, a nationalist organization with close connections to the ''[[Pamyat]]'', and (later) ''[[Rodina (political party)|Rodina]]''. In July 1991, Klykov signed the open letter [[A Word to the People]], an anti-Perestroika publication. In 1990s, Klykov was close to the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|CPRF]]; on 21 November 2005, he was elected the chairman of the re-founded [[Union of the Russian People]]. In 2005, he signed the "letter of 500", a controversial appeal to the Prosecutor General to review all Jewish organizations in Russia for extremism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.xeno.sova-center.ru/6BA2468/6BB4208/706B4D8?print=on |title=Alexander Verkhovsky.

'''''Zhongfeng Mingben''''' ({{zh|中峰明本|w=Chung-feng Ming-pen}} {{nihongo|Chūhō Myōhon}}, 1263–1323){{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=155}} was a [[Chan Buddhism|Chan Buddhist]] master who lived at the beginning of [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan China]]. He adhered to the rigorous style of the [[Linji school]] and influenced [[Zen]] through several Japanese teachers who studied under him.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b}}

==Biography==
Zhongfeng Mingben's family name was Sun.{{sfn|Lauer|2002|p=50}} He was the youngest of seven children.{{sfn|Lauer|2002|p=50}} His mother died when he was nine years old.{{sfn|Lauer|2002|p=51}} Already in his teenage years he wanted to become a monk.{{sfn|Lauer|2002|p=51}} From fifteen he observed the [[Upāsaka and Upāsikā|layman]]'s [[Five Precepts]].{{sfn|Lauer|2002|p=51}} His left hand became mutilated when, in his youth he burned the little finger as a sacrifice to the Buddha.{{sfn|Patry Leidy|2009|p=352}} This may have been inspired by chapter 23 of the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'':{{sfn|Lauer|2002|p=51}}
{{quote|If there is one, opening up his thought, wishes to attain [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|Anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi]], if he can burn a finger or a toe as an offering to a Buddhastupa, he shall exceed one who uses realm or walled city, wife or children, or even all the lands, mountains, forests, rivers, ponds, and sundry precious objects in the whole thousand-million-fold world as offerings.{{sfn|Lauer|2002|p=51}}}}

In 1287 Zhongfeng Mingben received [[tonsure]] at Shiziyuan [[vihara|Monastery]] on [[Tianmu Mountain]].{{sfn|Patry Leidy|2009|p=352}} In 1288 he was ordained as a [[bhikkhu|monk]].{{sfn|Lauer|2002|p=52}} Contrary to the norm, he grew long hair in (presumed) accordance with his teacher, Gaofeng Yuanmai.{{sfn|Patry Leidy|2009|p=352}}

As a young man he was appointed to succeed the abbot of the monastery on Tianmu Mountain, but fled the monastery in a search for solitude.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=159}}

As an adult he had an "overpowering physical build".{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=159}} He was called "The old Buddha south of the sea", an allusion to [[Mazu Daoyi]], (709–788){{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=159}} one of the most influential teachers of Chan Buddhism, who lived during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907), the "golden age of Zen".{{sfn|McRae|2003}} Zhongfeng Mingben declined a number of titles, appointments and positions, temporarily choosing instead a life of wandering and solitary meditation.{{sfn|Patry Leidy|2009|p=352}} He turned down an invitation of [[Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan]] to come to the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan court]].{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=197}}

==Teachings==

===Illusion===
In Zhongfeng Mingben's ''Huanzhu Jiaxun'', "Family instructions of Illusory Abiding",{{sfn|Heller|2009a}} he describes himself as "the illusionary man", alluding to the play of [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] and the ability of tricksters to create an illusionary world.{{sfn|Heller|2009a|pp=271–277}} Zhongfeng Mingben states that this world is illusory, but that there is no alternative to this illusion. Students have to realize the pervasiveness of this illusion, and learn to act within it.{{sfn|Heller|2009a|p=273}} The alternative for this illusionary or relative world, [[Two truths doctrine|the absolute truth]], is not to be regarded as an enduring phenomenon.{{sfn|Heller|2009a|p=294}}

Zhongfeng Mingben relies on the ''[[Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment]]'' in his teachings on how to overcome this illusion.{{sfn|Heller|2009a|p=285}} This sutra gives metaphors connected to illusion to explain the insubstantial nature of ignorance, such as dreams or flowers in the sky.{{sfn|Heller|2009a|p=285}}{{refn|group=note|"Flowers in the sky" is translated in Japanese as "Kuge" (ch. 19; "[[Shobogenzo]]" by [[Dogen Zenji]]). Sky stands for "empty" thus "Flowers in the empty". This corresponds to the principle of the [[Impermanence|insubstantiality]] (one of the [[Three marks of existence|three seals of Buddhism]]) thus that everything exists and nothing is real, in the sense that nothing has its own fixed reality, fixed measure, fixed form, nothing that is alive, has its own nature or independent, autonomous substantiality.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.flowersinthesky.com/fnc_en.htm Cultural association "Flowers in the Sky"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=note|The Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment says: "What is ignorance? Good sons, all sentient beings fall into various inverted views without beginning. Just like a disoriented person who confuses the four directions, they mistakenly take the [[Mahābhūta|Four Elements]] as the attributes of their bodies and the conditioned shadows of the [[Ṣaḍāyatana|Six Objects]] as the attributes of their mind. It is just like when our eyes are diseased and we see flowers in the sky, or a second moon. Good sons, the sky actually has no flowers—they are the false attachment of the diseased person. And because of this false attachment, not only are we confused about the self-nature of the sky; we are also mixed up about the place where real flowers come from. From this, there is the falsely existent transmigration through life and death. Therefore it is called "ignorance."&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.acmuller.net/bud-canon/sutra_of_perfect_enlightenment.html The Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment (Yuanjue jing), translated by Charles Muller] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015054918/http://www.acmuller.net/bud-canon/sutra_of_perfect_enlightenment.html |date=October 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Illusory phenomena emerge from an intrinsically pure ground.{{refn|group=note|The [[Buddha nature]], or the [[Eight Consciousnesses#Aālayavijñāna|Aālayavijñāna]]}} Since the illusions are not real in themselves, their disappearance will not change this pure ground. But the disappearance itself is also illusionary since the mind is enlightened or pure from the beginning. This makes it impossible to speak of either being enlightened or unenlightened, a position which is clearly at odds with basic Buddhist teachings. This is "cured" by overcoming "the discriminating thought processes that posit terms like ''illusion'' and ''real''".{{sfn|Heller|2009a|pp=287–288}}

===Physical practice===
Illusion is also created by relying on words. There are alternative, non-discursive ways of relating to words, one of them being ''k'an-hua'', "observing the key phrase", the method of [[Kōan#Observing the phrase|kōan study]] introduced by [[Dahui Zonggao]] (1089–1163).{{sfn|Heller|2009a|pp=273 &amp; 303}} Insight must be based in bodily experience rather than mere intellectual discrimination.

Another physical practice is calligraphy, the writing of characters. This writing is a bodily act. The writing of a character is not an intellectual inquiry, but "a performance of it".{{sfn|Heller|2009a|p=302}} Zhongfeng Mingben was a celebrated calligraphy artist.{{sfn|Lauer|2002}}

===Pure Land===
Zhongfeng Mingben merged Chán with [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]] teachings.{{sfn|Payne|Tanaka|2004|p=212}} Together with [[Yongming Yanshou]]  (904–975), who lived three centuries earlier, he was an influential proponent of this dual practice.{{sfn|Payne|Tanaka|2004|p=212}}

==Influence==

===Monastic discipline===
Zhongfeng Mingben lived after the "golden age of Chán" of the Tang and the proliferation of Chán during the Tang. His age was regarded as an age of ''mofa'' ([[Mappō|"Degenerate age of the Law"]]).{{sfn|Lauer|2002|p=50}} Zhongfeng Mingben attributed this to a lack of monastic discipline and a lack of personal dedication by monks,{{sfn|Lauer|2002|p=50}} and tried to counter this by writing a monastic code, the ''Huan-chu ch'ing-kuei'' (Jpn. ''Genju shingi''), in 1317.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=161}} This work influenced [[Musō Soseki]], a contemporary of Zhongfeng Mingben, when he wrote his guidelines for monasteries and monks, the ''Rinsen kakun''.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=161}}

===Gong-an===
{{further|Kōan}}
Zhongfeng Mingben was the first to compare the sayings and teachings of the 'masters of the old' with the public cases of the court, the ''gong-an''.

According to Zhongfeng Mingben ''gōng'àn'' abbreviates ''gōngfǔ zhī àndú'' (公府之案牘, Japanese ''kōfu no antoku'' – literally the ''andu'' "official correspondence; documents; files" of a ''gongfu''  "government post"), which referred to a "public record" or the "case records of a public law court" in [[Tang dynasty|Tang-dynasty]] China.{{sfn|Sasaki|1965|pp=4–6}}{{sfn|Foulk|2000|pp=21–22}}{{refn|group=note|Assertions that the literal meaning of ''kung-an'' is the table, desk, or bench of a magistrate appear on page 18 of Foulk 2000. See also {{sfn|McRae|2003|pp=172–173, note 16}}}} ''Kōan/gong'an'' thus serves as a [[metaphor]] for principles of reality beyond the private opinion of one person, and a teacher may test the student's ability to recognize and understand that principle.

===Japanese Zen===
[[File:Epistle to Zhongfeng Mingben.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Epistle to Zhongfeng Mingben {{nobreak|(与中峰明本尺牘, yochūhō myōhon sekitoku)}} One of six letters, ink on paper; {{nobreak|[[Seikadō Bunko Art Museum]]}}, Tokyo]]

Several Japanese Buddhists came to China to study with Zhongfeng Mingben on Mount T'ien-mu. They formed the Genjū line of the [[Five Mountain System#The Rinka|Rinka monasteries]], the more independent monasteries outside the cities and the [[Five Mountain System]] of government-approved temples. Kosen Ingen   was the most important of these Japanese students.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=197}}{{refn|group=note| (1295–1374) Founding priest of [[Chōju-ji (Kamakura)|Hōkizan Chōju-ji]] temple, [[Kenchoji|Kenchoji School]], Rinzai&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|title=Chojuji |url=http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~qm9t-kndu/chojuji.htm |accessdate=18 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805175751/http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~QM9T-KNDU/chojuji.htm |archivedate=August 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Other students include Kohō Kakumyō, a teacher of [[Bassui Tokushō]],{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=199}} and [[Jakushitsu Genkō]] (1290–1367), the founder of [[Eigen-ji]].{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|pp=203–204}}

Although they never met, Zhongfeng Mingben had a close affinity with [[Musō Soseki]], via the Japanese students who studied with him.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=159}}

===Wild fox slobber===
[[Hakuin|Hakuin's]] warning against "wild fox slobber" can be traced back to Zhongfeng Mingben.{{sfn|Hakuin|2009|pp=243–244, note 15}} The term "wild fox" points to teachers who lead students astray by giving wrong information. The term wild fox is also the name of the [[Wild fox koan]]. Whereas Zhongfeng Mingben warns against the impossible attempt of totally silencing the mind,{{sfn|Hakuin|2009|pp=243–244, note 15}} Hakuin uses the term in a more positive sense, to denote the workings of koans, which "possess the power to cause sudden death in students, raising the great doubt in their minds that will lead them to the 'great death' and the rebirth of [[satori]] and [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]]".{{sfn|Hakuin|2009|pp=243–244, note 15}}

==Criticism==
Zhongfeng Mingben's teachings mark the beginning of a development in Chinese Chán which made it vulnerable in the competition with other teachings:
{{quote|[T]he tradition came to be increasingly anti-intellectual in orientation and, in the process, reduced its complex heritage to simple formulae for which literal interpretations were thought to be adequate.{{sfn|Wright|2000|pp=209–210}}}}

This development left Chinese Chán vulnerable for criticisms by neo-Confucianism, which developed after the [[Song dynasty]]. Its anti-intellectual rhetoric was no match for the intellectual discourse of the neo-Confucianists.{{sfn|Wright|2000|pp=210–211}}
