'''''Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer''''' (1993) is a documentary film about [[Aileen Wuornos]], made by [[Nick Broomfield]]. It documents Broomfield's attempts to interview Wuornos, which involves a long process of mediation through her adopted mother Arlene Pralle and lawyer, Steve Glazer.

The film essentially highlights the exploitation of Wuornos by those around her and questions the fairness of her trial, given the vested interests of the police.

The film was used by the defense in the Wuornos trial in 2001 to highlight the incompetence of Wuornos' original lawyer. It was through this process that Broomfield decided to make a second film, ''[[Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer]]''.

For the feature film ''[[Monster (2003 film)|Monster]]'', [[Charlize Theron]] used this film as source material, apparently watching clips in-between takes in order to perfect her character. For her performance, Theron won a [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] Oscar, awarded on what would have been Wuornos's birthday.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0340855/awards&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/wuornos805.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''An Uncommon Story''''' ({{lang-ru|Необыкнове́нная исто́рия|translit=Neobyknovennaya istoriya}}) is an [[Autobiography|autobiographical]] literary [[memoir]] by [[Ivan Goncharov]], written in 1875&amp;ndash;1876 (with an 1878 addendum) and first published in [[1924 in literature|1924]]. Parts of it were later included into ''The Complete Goncharov'' (1978&amp;ndash;1980, Vol VII).

According to the [[Gale (publisher)|''Gale Encyclopedia of Biography'']], ''An Uncommon Story'' "…confirmed the psychopathic side of [its author's] personality; it is an account of imagined plots against him and imagined attempts by others to plagiarize his work."&lt;ref name="gale"&gt;{{cite web | author = | date=| url=http://www.answers.com/topic/ivan-goncharov| title =Ivan Aleksandrovich Goncharov| publisher  = Gale Encyclopedia of Biography| accessdate = 2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers disagreed, finding there was much more veracity to Goncharov's claims than had previously been reported.&lt;ref name="feb"&gt;{{cite web | author = Budanova, N.F.| date = | url = http://feb-web.ru/feb/gonchar/critics/gmi/gmi-1842.htm| script-title=The Uncommon Story: The True Facts. Foreword. | publisher  = feb-web.ru|language=Russian| accessdate = 2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''An Uncommon Story'' had one single agenda: to prove that [[Ivan Turgenev]] has not only borrowed  major ideas, character types, and conflicts from Goncharov's ''[[The Precipice (Ivan Goncharov)|The Precipice]]'' to use in his ''[[Home of the Gentry]]'', but also (in the author's words) "infused the best European literature with them." 

''An Uncommon Story'' caused much debate; that it was published at all caused some controversy, for according to its author's special request, these memoirs were to be issued only in case plagiarism accusations were brought against him after his death. Since no such allegations have ever been made, Goncharov's book was formally published contrary to his will. In this same note, however, the author mentioned that he wished for future "historians of Russian literature" to take hold of it. 

It was the latter who deemed the publication advisable since (according to scholar N. F. Budanova) "it shed an important light upon Goncharov and Turgenev's relations," and also provided researchers with "valuable material for making a comparative analysis of both classic novels which, indeed, had striking similarities."&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Ivan Goncharov.jpg|thumb|left|Ivan Goncharov]]
In the mid-1850s, Ivan Goncharov and Ivan Turgenev were on friendly terms. Goncharov, who'd launched his career in a spectacular fashion and was declared by some a "true [[Nikolay Gogol]] heir", had no serious rival as a novelist on the Russian literary scene until the late 1850s; [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] was still in exile, [[Leo Tolstoy]] was writing novelets and short stories, and Turgenev was considered a master of miniatures. 

The success of ''[[Home of the Gentry]]'' must have come as a surprise to Goncharov, who'd never considered Turgenev a novelist. In a letter dated March 28, 1859, he wrote: "Would it be permissible for me to comment on your talent? I'd say you've got a gift for drawing tender landscapes, and have a keen ear, but you seem to be eager to erect monumental structures [...] and give us drama.&lt;ref&gt;Russian: ''Если смею выразить Вам взгляд мой на Ваш талант, то скажу, что Вам дан нежный, верный рисунок и звуки, а Вы порываетесь строить огромные здания... и хотите дать драму.&lt;/ref&gt; Goncharov's opinion seemingly never altered.&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

Literary historians argued later that Turgenev's overnight success might have seemed totally undeserved for Goncharov, who, for quite a while, felt like he was the only master of his field. Goncharov produced one  novel in a decade, but his new rival did it in a seemingly fleeting manner, which must have made the injustice look even more gross. 

Of all the possible explanations for the improbable manner in which Turgenev, a master of miniatures, could have suddenly re-invented himself as a novelist, only one for Goncharov looked plausible: the younger man must have nicked his own ideas, structures, conflicts, and character types, and "with these pearls started to play his own lyre." 

Some commentators later dismissed such claims as borne out of jealousy, aggravated by Goncharov's natural suspiciousness, impressionability, and general [[hypochondria]]. Others argued that this would have been too simple an explanation, for while many of Goncharov's allegations were far-fetched, some were not altogether groundless. At least one fact was undisputed: in 1855, having returned from his long sea voyage, Goncharov laid out before Turgenev, his then good friend, the whole plan of his future third novel, which he has conceived as far back as 1849.&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;
[[File:Iwan Turgenew.jpg|thumb|[[Ivan Turgenev]]]]

In 1887, four years after Turgenev's death, Goncharov attached a note to this novel's original text, which read: "This manuscript contains the material for a novel which in 1869, as ''[[Vestnik Evropy]]'' was about to publish it, I gave the title ''The Precipice''. Before that I used to refer to is as ''Raisky, the Artist'' and was freely expounding upon it to my fellow writers, mostly to Turgenev. It was to him that in 1855, soon after returning from my around-the-world journey, I recounted in detail, in the course of several meetings, all the details of it [...] because he, being a perceptive and sensitive  man of art, seemed to be most sympathetic to those of my works that he promised a great future for."&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

Judging by Goncharov and Turgenev's correspondence, in the mid-1850s, the two men were very close. Goncharov valued Turgenev as a well-educated, clever critic with an impeccable literary taste. In ''An Uncommon Story'' he wrote: "Once Turgenev told me briefly: 'As long as one single Russian remains on Earth, ''[[Oblomov]]'' will be remembered... Another time, as I was reading him form chapters I've written in Petersburg, he suddenly rose from his divan and departed to his bedroom. 'Old sparrow as I am, you touched me to tears', he said upon his return, wiping his eyes."&lt;ref&gt;An Uncommon Story. P.202.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tellingly, Turgenev even prompted minor detail to ''Oblomov'', namely, in the scene where Olga and Schtoltz converse in [[Switzerland]]. Goncharov acknowledged Turgenev's priority in "discovering nihilism", and admitted there was historical and artistic authenticity to Bazarov's character. In the late 1850s relations between the two apparently deteriorated, and in March 1860 things came to a head.&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

===Accusations of plagiarism===
Prior to the publication of ''Home of the Gentry'', Goncharov took an opportunity to get acquainted with the original text at recitals held by Turgenev for a circle of friends. He pointed to its author that many ideas, fragments of a plotline and situations looked very much like they've been copied from ''The Precipice'', the novel which was yet unpublished but very familiar to Turgenev in every detail. On March 27, 1860, Goncharov reminded Turgenev in a letter: "Remember, there was the time when you agreed that the general plan of your novel and characters' interactions had been similar [to that of mine]; you even excluded one scene, too obviously similar to mine, which made me feel totally satisfied." In another letter, dated March 28, Goncharov specified the scene similar to that which involved Vera and grandmother (in ''The Precipice''), which, being "a weak one", had been "magnanimously sacrificed" by Turgenev.&lt;ref&gt;''Complete Goncharov'', Moscow, 1978, Vol.VIII, p.263.&lt;/ref&gt; The scene mentioned was absent from the final version of ''Home of the Gentry'', but references to it have been found in rough copies of the novel; this  corroborated Goncharov's claim that Turgenev indeed had been making some cuts so as to make parallels less obvious. According to N. Budanova, "it is important to bear in mind that parallels between the two novels were for all to see and Turgenev at one point conceded as much, blaming his 'over-impressionability' for this."&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

On March 29, 1860, in the critic [[Stepan Dudyshkin]]'s flat an "arbitrary court" took place, with [[Pavel Annenkov]], [[Alexander Druzhinin]] and [[Aleksandr Nikitenko]] present. The court's verdict was conciliatory: "Since both Turgenev's and Goncharov's novels have had for their ground the very same soil of Russian reality, similarities and coincidences, in ideas and even phraseology, would only be natural and for both writers excusable."&lt;ref&gt;Annenkov, Pavel. Literature Memoirs. М., 1960. Pp.441—442. //Nikitenko, Vol.2, pp.115—116.&lt;/ref&gt; After that Goncharov and Turgenev stopped communicating. In 1864, at Druzhinin's funeral, they made peace but never became friends again, even if Turgenev in one of his letters mentioned his feeling "very close to Goncharov." As Turgenev's new novels were appearing one after another, Goncharov was becoming more and more resentful, apparently seeing his worst suspicions confirmed.&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

====The manuscript====
The original manuscript, a notebook, consisting of 53 pages, held in the Russian National Library, according to N.Budanova, looks very much like a rough copy that's never been revisited by the author, with lots of edits, some fragments blotted out so as to be unreconstructable. The notebook consists of two parts, written in different times. Part 1, ''Uncommon Story (True Facts)'', pages 1–50, is dated December 1875 and January 1876. The author's commentary to it reads: {{quote|Hereby I express my will for my ancestors or whoever get hold of this manuscript, to extract from it and make public whatever they feel necessary [...] but only if, through Turgenev’s efforts, or otherwise, a notion (based on similarities between my novel and those of Turgenev and some West European authors) should become prevalent in the press that it was me who had borrowed from them and not vice versa, and that I was just following other people's steps. [Otherwise]... I would like this manuscript to be burnt down or transferred to the Imperial Public library for the use of future historians of Russian literature.}} 
Part 2, pages 51–53, dated July 1878, had another note attached to it: "I've sealed the previous fifty pages in an envelope as finished. But in the course of the last 2.5 years lots of things have happened related to this case and I see that, having once started, I need to continue..." There is an inscription on the envelope: "These papers which have to do with me personally, I commit to Sophia Aleksandrovna Nikitenko for her to deal with them as I asked her to. Ivan Goncharov, May 19, 1883".&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

== Analysis ==
''An Uncommon Story'' was first published in 1924 by the Russian Public Library archives, with a foreword by D. I. Abramovich. It was preceded by the publication in 1923 of the whole of the Goncharov-Turgenev correspondence by Boris Engelgardt, who accompanied it with a thorough analysis of the two authors' relations.&lt;ref&gt;I.A.Goncharov and I.S.Turgenev. From the Unpublished material of the Pushkin House. Foreword and commentaries by B.M. Engelgardt, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt; For decades, the issue lay dormant. 
[[File:Uncommon story autograph.jpg|thumb|Page 1 of ''An Uncommon Story'' manuscript. 1875 authoghraph.]]
Then in 1972, A. Batyuto suggested Goncharov might have been a major influence on early Turgenev, after all.&lt;ref&gt;Batyuto, A. Turgenev and Goncharov // Turgenev the Novelist. Leningrad, 1972. Pp.326—349.&lt;/ref&gt; Having drawn the comparative analysis of Turgenev's ''[[On the Eve]]'' and Goncharov's ''The Precipice'', the author came to the conclusion: the former most obviously used "methods of novel-structuring he'd borrowed from other writers, Goncharov included". According to Batyuto, when it came to the art of building up a novel, Turgenev in his early days was certainly taking cues from Goncharov.&lt;ref&gt;Batyuto, p.347.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1976, O. Demikhovskaya in an article called "I.A. Goncharov and I.S. Turgenev" criticized the 'biased approach' to the problem demonstrated by Engelgardt, who in 1923 made an emphasis on Goncharov's personal idiosyncrasies as being the major factor behind the conflict. She presented Turgenev as the guilty party and recounted numerous quarrels he had with [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].&lt;ref&gt;The New Materials, 1976. Pp.85—94.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to V. Nezdvedtsky, the reason behind the two writers' conflict was "the typological resemblances of both and Goncharov's jealousy of his more fortunate rival." The author poined out that, while working on a completely new type of Russian novel (and leaving behind Grigorovich and Pisemsky with their traditionalism), both Goncharov (who first came up with the idea of plotline's "poetisation") and Turgenev were up against common challenges and were therefore keenly aware of each other's works. This by no means involved plagiarism: Goncharov himself in ''An Uncommon Story'' drew nothing but parallels, the critic argued. Nezdvetsky thought the conflict might have been easily resolved should Turgenev have been more straightforward in admitting his earlier influences.&lt;ref&gt;Nezdvedtsky, V.A. The Uncommon Story, VII, pp.449—458 // The Turgenev vs Goncharov conflict as an issue for literary historians. // Slavica. Debrecen. 1986. Vol.XXIII. Pp.315—332.&lt;/ref&gt; N. Budanova thought such thing would have been impossible at the time for it would have been perceived by the public as a confession of plagiarism.&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt; 

While the fact that ''The Precipice'' and ''Home of the Gentry'' had a lot in common, Goncharov's other allegations have been unanimously dismissed by literary historians as groundless. Parallels he's drawn between ''The Precipice'' and Turgenev's ''[[Fathers and Sons (novel)|Fathers and Sons]]'' were proved to be far-fetched, as was his claim that ''[[Torrents of Spring]]'', was 'an improvisation' on ''The Precipice''{{'}} part I.&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt; Goncharov's claims that some European authors started to use his ideas and character types through Turgenev's influence are seen to be void, although Budanova noted that  some contemporary critics might have prompted such an idea to the author who in his later life grew to be highly impressionable and suspicious. For example, [[Aleksey Suvorin]] in his article "The French Society in [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s new novel" suggested that the ''[[Sentimental Education]]''{{'}} main character Frédéric Moreau was "akin to the so-called 'people of the 1840s' in Russia and that he was "similar to Raisky... its just that Flaubert has treated his character more objectively than our respected novelist."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Vestnik Evropy]]''. 1870, No.2. P.822.&lt;/ref&gt; Some similarities between Goncharov's characters and those of [[Madame Bovary]] have been mentioned by Russian critics too.&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

Goncharov's allegations, made in ''An Uncommon Story'', that Turgenev did a lot of harm to Russian literature in the West, have been proved invalid. On the contrary, Turgenev has been praised by many as an avid a promoter of Russian classics: his own translations of the works by [[Pushkin]], [[Lermontov]] and [[Gogol]] into French did a lot to popularize them in Europe. Several translations of important Russian works have been made through his recommendations. "We have every reason to insist that Turgenev preached Russian literature to the West. Forms and methods of such popularization have been different, and it is upon Turgenev's great authority that Western views on many Russian novels are still being based upon," wrote Soviet scholar Mikhail Alekseev in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Alexeyev, M.P. I.S.Turgenev as the Russian Literature's propagator in the West. The works of the New Russian literature dpt. Moscow, Leningrad, 1948. P.80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Basilica of Our Lady''' ({{lang-nl|Basiliek van Onze-Lieve-Vrouw}}; [[Limburgish]]/[[Maastrichtian dialect|Maastrichtian]] [colloquial]: ''Slevrouwe'') is a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church in the historic center of [[Maastricht]], [[Netherlands]]. The church is dedicated to [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Our Lady]] of the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]] ({{lang-nl|Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-Tenhemelopneming}}) and is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[parish church]] in the [[Diocese of Roermond]]. The church is often referred to as the ''Star of the Sea'' ({{lang-nl|Sterre der Zee}}), after the church's main [[Roman Catholic devotions|devotion]], [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea]].

== History ==
The present-day church is probably not the first church that was built on this site. However, since no [[archeology|archeological]] research has ever been carried out inside the building, nothing certain can be said about this. The church's site, inside the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[castrum]] and adjacent to a religious shrine dedicated to the god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], suggests that the site was once occupied by a Roman temple. It is not unlikely that the town's first church was built here and that this church in the 4th or 5th century became the [[cathedral]] of the [[diocese]] of [[Prince-Bishopric_of_Liège#Origin_of_the_bishopric|Tongeren-Maastricht]]. 

Some time before the year 1100 the church became a [[collegiate church]], run by a [[college (canon law)|college]] of [[canon (priest)|canons]]. The canons were appointed by the [[prince-bishop]] of [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège|Liège]]. The [[Provost (religion)|provosts]] were chosen from the [[Chapter (religion)|chapter]] of [[St. Lambert's Cathedral, Liège]]. The chapter of Our Lady's had around 20 canons, which made it a middle-sized chapter in the [[diocese of Liège]]. Until the end of the chapter in 1798 it maintained its strong ties with Liège. Parishioners of Our Lady's were identified in old documents as belonging to the ''Familia Sancti Lamberti''.&lt;ref&gt;Bosman, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that the chapter of [[Basilica of Saint Servatius|Saint Servatius]] was the more powerful institution in Maastricht, with strong ties to the [[emperors of the Holy Roman Empire]], but throughout the [[Middle Ages]] the two churches remained rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Bosman, pp. 25-34&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Interieur OLV-kerk, Maastricht (Ph v Gulpen, ca 1860).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Interior in the mid-19th-century]]
Most of the present church was built in the 11th and 12th centuries. Construction of the imposing [[westwork]] started shortly after 1000 AD. In the 13th century the nave received Gothic vaults. Around 1200 the canons abandoned their communal lifestyle, after which canons' houses were built in the vicinity of the church. In the 14th century a parish church was built next to the collegiate church, so the main building could be reserved for the canons' religious duties. Of this parish church, dedicated to [[Saint Nicholas|Saint Nicolas]], very little remains as it was demolished in 1838. Apart from Saint Nicholas Church, the parish made use of three other chapels dedicated to [[Hilary of Poitiers|Saint Hilarius]], [[Eberigisil|Saint Evergislus]], and Saint Mary Minor.&lt;ref&gt;Bosman, pp. 165-166&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-16th century the present late Gothic cloisters replaced the earlier cloisters.

After the incorporation of Maastricht in the [[French First Republic]] in 1794, the town's religious institutions were dissolved (1798).  Many of the [[church treasure]]s were lost during this period. The church and cloisters were used as a blacksmith shop and stables by the military [[garrison]]. This situation continued until 1837 when the church was restored to the religious practice. This coincided with the demolishing of Saint Nicholas Church and the transfer of the parish to Our Lady's.

From 1887 to 1917 the church was thoroughly restored by well-known Dutch architect [[Pierre Cuypers]]. Cuypers basically removed everything that did not fit his ideal of a Romanesque church. Parts of the east choir, the two choir towers, and the south aisle were almost entirely rebuilt.

The church was elevated to the rank of [[minor basilica]] by [[Pope Pius XI]] on 20 February 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sterre-der-zee.nl/teksten/geschiedenis.html|title=Geschiedenis|language=Dutch|work=Sterre-der-zee.nl|author=Church website|accessdate=11 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206034033/http://www.sterre-der-zee.nl/teksten/geschiedenis.html|archivedate=6 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description exterior ==
[[File:OLVOostkoorKapiteelApsis.jpg|thumb|Romanesque capital of the apse]]
The building is largely [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] in style and is considered an important example of the [[Mosan art|Mosan]] group of churches that are characterized by massive [[westwork]]s and pseudo-[[transept]]s. Our Lady's in Maastricht indeed has a tall, massive westwork and two pseudo-transepts on each side. The westwork, built of carbonic [[sandstone]], dates from the early 11th century and is flanked by two narrow towers with [[marl]]stone [[turret]]s. Some [[spolia]], probably from the former Roman [[castrum]] of Maastricht, were used on the lower parts of the westwork. The [[nave]] with its transept and pseudo-transepts largely dates from the second half of the 11th century.

The church has two [[Choir (architecture)|choirs]] and two [[crypt]]s. The east choir dates from the 12th century and is decorated with carved Romanesque [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] (several of which are 19th-century copies). The east crypt is a century older. During the building campaign the original plan for the eastern part of the church was abandoned and a new scheme, based on the newly finished choir of [[St. Lambert's Cathedral, Liège]], adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Bosman, pp. 143-149&lt;/ref&gt; The current, heavily-restored choir towers are roofed with [[Rhenish helm]]s of stone rather than shingling. One of the towers, named after [[Saint Barbara]], was used for storage of the city archives and the [[church treasury]].

A 13th-century [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Portal (architecture)|portal]], rebuilt in the 15th century, provides access to the church from [[Onze Lieve Vrouweplein]]. It is also the entrance of the so-called ''Mérode chapel'' (or ''Star of the Sea chapel'').

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Description interior ==
Although the interior of the church underwent many changes throughout the centuries, it has an 'authentic' Romanesque feel to it. This is largely due to the restoration ideas of the architect [[Pierre Cuypers]], who had several of the larger Gothic windows replaced by small Romanesque windows, thus creating a darker, 'mystical' atmosphere. Cuypers also removed the white [[plastering]] of the late Baroque period and had several altars built in a [[Romanesque Revival|Romanesque]] or [[Gothic Revival]] style. Despite all these changes, the turbulent history of the building is still legible. Some murals dating from the Middle Ages have survived (including one of [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]] from the 14th century). A mural on a pillar of [[Saint Christopher]] and the [[Infant Jesus]] dates from 1571. The large ceiling painting in the choir is Neo-Romanesque and dates from the Cuypers restoration. All [[stained glass]] windows are from the 19th or 20th century.

[[Image:OLV-00.jpg|thumb|Church plan with cloisters]]
The furnishing of the church interior has followed the fashion of the time but suffered badly during the years of [[desecration]] (1798-1837). In 1380 the church had 33 altars&lt;ref&gt;Van Term, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; but most of the medieval church inventory got lost in the turbulence that followed the arrival of the French in 1794. A precious baptismal font by the Maastricht metalworker [[Aert van Tricht]] (c. 1500) survived but was stripped of most of its ornaments. Several Baroque [[confessional]]s and a richly carved [[pulpit]] were taken over from a former nearby [[Jesuit]] church. The 18th-century Baroque altar, now in the southern transept, is from the former Church of Saint Nicholas. The large [[pipe organ]] was built in 1652 by André Severin.

Among the works of art owned by the church are a wood panel of ''The dream of Jacob'' (Flemish, c. 1500-1550), a large canvas with the [[Holy Family]] (Southern Netherlands, c. 1600), a large painting of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] (Southern Netherlands, 17th century), two paintings attributed to [[Erasmus Quellinus II]], one of [[Saint Cecilia]] and one of [[Saint Agnes]] (17th century), a 14th-century German [[Pieta]], two 15th-century statues of the [[Virgin Mary]] (including the famous one in the Star of the Sea chapel), an [[Anna selbdritt]] and a [[Saint Christopher]], both attributed to the Maastricht sculptor [[Jan van Steffeswert]] (c. 1500).

The [[architectural sculpture]] in the interior of the Basilica of Our Lady belongs to the highlights of [[Mosan art]]. The 20 highly symbolic capitals in the choir [[ambulatory]] depict scenes from the [[Old Testament]], as well as various kinds of animals, monsters, birds, naked or scarcely dressed humans entangled in foliage, and humans fighting with animals. One capital in particular is famous as it was signed 'Heimo', probably by its maker who may also be represented on it, handing over a capital to the [[virgin Mary]]. The carved capitals and [[corbel]]s of the choir gallery, as well as the capitals in the nave, are of a slightly later date and less vivid, depicting mainly foliage with some human and animal figures.&lt;ref&gt;Den Hartog, pp. 415-463&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the carved capitals, as well as some important [[relief]]s elsewhere in the church, date from the second half of the 12th century. A close relationship has been established between the Romanesque sculpture in Our Lady's and that in the [[Basilica of Saint Servatius]] in Maastricht, the [[Pieterskerk, Utrecht|Church of St Peter]] in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] and the [[Doppelkirche Schwarzrheindorf|Schwarzrheindorf double chapel]] in [[Bonn]].&lt;ref&gt;Den Hartog, pp. 270-281, 327&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cloisters and Star of the Sea chapel ==
[[File:Maastricht sept 2011 056 Basiliek van Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-Tenhemelopneming (Maastricht).jpg|thumb|Star of the Sea chapel - interior]]
Access to the [[cloisters]], which enclose a garden, is through the church. The current [[cloisters]] were built in marlstone in late Gothic style with some [[Renaissance]] elements in 1558/59. They replaced the older Romanesque cloisters, of which some capitals have survived in the collection of the [[Bonnefantenmuseum]].&lt;ref&gt;Den Hartog, pp. 482-488&lt;/ref&gt; The floor of the cloisters is paved with monumental grave stones, some of them from the demolished Saint Nicholas Church. In 1910 a tower of the Roman castrum was found in the cloister garden.

For many people the main attraction of the Basilica of Our Lady is the miraculous statue of [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea]]. This 15th-century wooden statue was originally housed in a nearby [[Franciscan]] monastery. In 1801 it was moved to the former parish church of Saint Nicholas, adjacent to Our Lady's. After the closure of that church in 1837, the statue moved to Our Lady's. In 1903 it was placed in a Gothic chapel near the main entrance where it remains today and where it is daily visited by hundreds of worshipers. Twice a year it is being carried around town in the city's religious [[procession]]s.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Treasury ==
The Basilica of our Lady possesses an important historical church [[treasure]] consisting of [[relic]]s, [[reliquary|reliquaries]], textiles and [[liturgical]] objects. From the 14th century onwards it had a separate treasury room (Dutch: ''[[schatkamer]]''), which at one point was located in the Tower of Saint Barbara (also the church's archives). It is believed that the choir gallery of Our Lady's was specifically built in the 12th century for the public showing of the recently acquired relics from [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Bosman, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; During the Middle Ages great rivalry existed between Maastricht's two religious chapters. At several occasions the chapter of Saint Servatius complained about the fact that the canons at Our Lady's showed their relics in the open air, which only St Servatius' was allowed to do. The relics display, especially at the time of the [[Pilgrimage of the Relics, Maastricht|Septennial Pilgrimage]] (Dutch: ''Heiligdomsvaart''), drew large numbers of [[pilgrim]]s from all over Europe, bringing in revenue for the churches.&lt;ref&gt;Koldeweij/Van Vlijmen, pp. 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:0OLVSchatkamer01 Zuid.jpg|thumb|Main chamber of the Treasury]]
[[File:0OLVSchatkamer06 Textielschat.jpg|thumb|Chest of drawers with liturgical vestments]]
Today the church treasure is only a fraction of what it once was. Many gold and silver objects were melted down in order to pay for [[war tax]]es during the tumultuous period after the French conquest of Maastricht in 1794. Other pieces were sold for personal gain or given away. Even as late as 1837, the church lost two of its most precious possessions out of ignorance. A 10th-century reliquary in the shape of a [[patriarchal cross]], allegedly containing the largest particle of the [[True Cross]], and the so-called "pectoral cross of [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]]" (both originating from Constantinople and probably taken to Maastricht by [[crusaders]]) were given away by a former canon and are now in the treasury of the [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Vatican City]].&lt;ref&gt;De Kreek, pp. 90-115&lt;/ref&gt; Two copper-gilt reliefs depicting angels are now in the [[Treasury of the Basilica of Saint Servatius]].&lt;ref&gt;De Kreek, pp. 237-246&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases the reliquaries were lost but the content (the relics) was saved. This is the case with the so-called "[[Girdle of Thomas|Virgin's Girdle]]". Of the original silver statues of the Virgin and two angels only a silver tube with the girdle survived.&lt;ref&gt;De Kreek, pp. 167-174&lt;/ref&gt;

The treasure of the basilica of Our Lady as it is today consists of reliquary boxes, cases or busts made of ([[Gilding|gilded]]) silver or copper, [[Silvering|silvered]] lead, brass, ivory, horn, bone and wood; [[chalice]]s, [[paten]]s, [[monstrance]]s and other liturgical implements made of silver, silver-gilt, brass or tin; ecclesiastical [[vestment]]s and ancient fabrics used for wrapping relics; antique books and manuscripts; paintings, prints and sculptures; and some archeological finds. The highlights are:
* Silver reliquary for the "girdle of the Virgin Mary" (Maastricht?, 14th century, incomplete)
* Tower belonging to a silver statue of [[Saint Barbara]] (Maastricht?, 16th century, the statue was melted down in 1795)&lt;ref&gt;De Kreek, pp. 179-181&lt;/ref&gt;
* Three ivory reliquary chests (southern Italy or Spain, 12th or 13th century)&lt;ref&gt;De Kreek, pp. 143-148&lt;/ref&gt;
* Three reliquary horns: one made of cattle horn with silvered lead furnishings (Scandinavia, 10th century), one of ivory with red copper furnishings (Southern Europe, 14th or 15th century) and one made of wood (Germany, 15th century)&lt;ref&gt;De Kreek, pp. 158-164&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two silver [[ostensorium|ostensoria]] (Meuse-Rhine, 14th and 15th centuries)&lt;ref&gt;De Kreek, pp. 192-195, 205-207&lt;/ref&gt;
* Red velvet ''bursa'' or reliquary purse (France, 15th century). In 1913 there were 8 textile bursas in the treasury (some 13th century); all but one lost.&lt;ref&gt;De Kreek, pp. 132-141&lt;/ref&gt;
* So-called "Robe of [[Lambert of Maastricht|Saint Lambert]]" (Central Asia, 10th-13th centuries?)&lt;ref&gt;De Kreek, pp. 230-236&lt;/ref&gt;
Forthermore, the treasury is home to a collection of [[Roman Catholic devotions|devotional objects]] ([[crucifix]]es, [[statuette]]s, [[rosary|rosaries]], [[scapular]]s, [[pilgrim badge]]s, and [[In memoriam card]]s) belonging to the foundation "Santjes en Kantjes".

'''Benoy''' is an international firm of [[architects]], [[master planners]], [[interior architects]] and [[graphic designers]] working from [[design studios]] in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Shanghai]] and [[Beijing]]. The company is primarily known for its global retail architecture, with projects such as [[Westfield London]] UK, [[Elements, Hong Kong]], and [[ION Orchard and The Orchard Residences|ION]] Singapore.

Its philosophy is that 'creativity and viability are not mutually exclusive'.

== Company history ==
Founded by Gordon Benoy as a small architectural company in rural [[Nottinghamshire]], the company developed and grew until 1987 when, after a merger, 'Gordon Benoy &amp; Partners' became 'Fitch Benoy'. During the early 1990s the deep recession at that time created difficulties for many in the property and construction industry. Consequently, in 1992 a [[management buyout]] resulted in the current company name ''Benoy''.

The company is headed by its chairman, Graham Cartledge CBE, who has been with the company since 1974.

The company has expanded from the UK. In 2002 it opened its first overseas office in Hong Kong which has been quickly followed by offices in Shanghai, Singapore, Beijing, Mumbai, Abu Dhabi and Kuala Lumpur. In 2015, Benoy extended its global presence to Dubai and Melbourne.
 
The company now employs over 500 staff across 11 locations.

The '''British Shakespeare Company''' was a British open-air touring [[Shakespeare]] Company.   Founded by Robert J. Williamson in 1994 (as the '''R. J. Williamson Company'''), it was renamed in 2005.  Originally based in [[Leeds]] (performing in the ruins of [[Kirkstall Abbey]]), the company later established Shakespeare festivals for [[Brighton]], [[Nottingham]], The [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Kew Gardens]], [[Cannizaro Park]] in Wimbledon and [[Holland Park Theatre]] in central London.

The company produced two of Shakespeare's most commercially popular plays each year from 1994 to 2007, totalling over 700 performances, usually featuring household names from film, television and stage. These have included [[James Alexandrou]] from ''[[EastEnders]]'', [[Pierce Brosnan]]'s actor son Sean, the dancer and performer [[Wayne Sleep]], and the comedian [[Norman Pace]]. The 2007 shows, ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' and ''[[As You Like It]]'' toured Norway, Windsor, Leeds and Oxford. In 2008 the company performed ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' for two nights at [[Arundel Castle]].

The company's last tour in 2009 starred [[Mark Arden]], [[Louisa Lytton]], [[Daniela Lavender]], [[David Davies (actor)|David Davies]], [[Gabriel Thomson]], [[Steven Blakeley]] and Robert J. Williamson. The company performed ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' and ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''. This was the BSC's largest tour, commencing at the [[Rose Theatre, Kingston]], [[Trinity College, Dublin]], Ramme Gaard in Norway, before visiting [[Gawsworth Hall]] in Cheshire, [[Norwich Cathedral]], [[Kentwell Hall]] in Suffolk, [[Kirkstall Abbey]] in Leeds, Burgrave Palace in [[Prague]], Sterts Theatre in Cornwall and [[Arundel Castle]] in West Sussex.  Since this tour there has been no further activity by the company.

From 2006, when the company began performing at [[Ramme Gaard]], an ecological estate with an outdoor [[amphitheatre]] on the coast of [[Norway]], the Norwegian billionaire and philanthropist [[Petter Olsen]] was its patron.

The '''Bèze Abbey''' ({{lang-fr|Abbaye Saint-Pierre, Saint-Paul de Bèze}}), was a monastery founded in 629&amp;nbsp;AD in Burgundy, France. 
It was destroyed several times during the next three centuries by Frankish warlords, Saracens, Normans and Hungarians.
At the end of the 10th century the abbey was re-founded and entered a golden age for the next two centuries.
By the 13th century the spiritual life of the abbey had declined and the monks were mainly concerned with temporal matters. 
The abbey lost most of its monks during the [[Hundred Years' War]] and the [[Black Death]] of the 14th century.
In 1429 it was fortified with stone walls, a moat and towers, two of which have survived.
The abbey was again devastated by feuds in 1513, and by the [[French Wars of Religion]] (1562–98) and the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48).

In 1662 a final revival began when the monastery came under the [[Congregation of Saint Maur]].
Most of the surviving buildings date from the reconstruction by this congregation in the 18th century.
At the start of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789 the monastery was dissolved and the property taken over by the state.
It was sold, and the church and main buildings demolished so the stone could be used for building.
The owners of the property added an orangerie and laid out a park in the 19th century.
Today the private owners have made the grounds and buildings open for visitors for a small fee.

The abbey's location was called the "Fountain of Bèze", after a [[karst spring]] that is the source of the [[Bèze (river)|Bèze river]].
The ''Chronique de Bèze'' from the first 3rd of the 12th century, describes foundation of the abbey on an unoccupied site.{{sfn|Marillier|Velard|1958|p=35}}
The Chronicle says:
{{blockquote|He found a place between the [[Saône]] and [[Tille (river)|Tille]], where there sprang an important river called Bèze, with very clear waters, drinkable and rich in all sorts of fish. This river was not like the others which, along their course, increase by receiving streams; from its source, it is a great river. There are all kinds of herbs that can serve as food in case of scarcity ... The land is fairly good and bears abundant fruit if it is cultivated. The meadows are quite rich; it is possible to raise flocks. Forests surround this place; they are sufficient to provide timber and all that is necessary to man.{{sfn|Chronicon beanense|p=234}} }}

Amalgaire's wife Aquilina gave him two sons and one daughter, born between 595 and 605.
His son Adalric would succeed him while his son Waldelene was educated as a monk at the [[Luxeuil Abbey]] under the [[Rule of Saint Columbanus]].
His daughter Adalsinde also became a nun.{{sfn|Dupraz|1961|p=26}}
Waldelene became the first abbot at Bèze.{{sfn|Dunod de Charnage|1750|p=56}}
Amalgaire also founded a monastery at [[Bregille (Besançon)|Bregille]] on the right bank of the [[Doubs (river)|Doubs]] for his daughter Adalsinde, who became its first abbess. 
This monastery was given the existing Church of Saint Martin at Bregville.{{sfn|Dunod de Charnage|1750|p=56}}
Amalgaire gave the Bèze Abbey a rich endowment of 31 domains with forests, vineyards and buildings, cultivators and winegrowers.{{sfn|Dupraz|1961|p=26}}
He gave it vineyards in the Gevrey-Chambertin region that today are the source of the famous [[Chambertin-Clos de Bèze]] red Burgundy wine.{{sfn|Parker|2010|p=408}}

==Merovingian period (629–714)==

The monks of Bèze followed the [[Rule of Saint Columbanus]], which Waldalène brought from [[Luxeuil Abbey]].
The first buildings were a rectangular stone structure surrounded by wood and earth outbuildings with thatched roofs.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}
After the death of Amalgaire around 655 civil war raged in Burgundy and the country was ravaged by rival bands of [[Neustria]]n and [[Austrasia]]n Franks.{{sfn|Choullier|1879|p=339}}
The reign of [[Chlothar III]] (r. 657–673), son of [[Clovis II]] (r. 639–657), had just started in Austrasia in late 657 when civil disturbances made Brégille untenable.
Adalsinde and her brother Adalric begged her brother Waldelène and his monks to give her and her nuns refuge in Bèze, and in return transferred to him the priests of Saint Martin.{{sfn|Dupraz|1961|p=28}}

Bèze was also ruined, its property titles destroyed and its monks scattered.
When peace was restored Waldalene made haste to repair the losses of his monastery.
To proceed faster he used credit from the new [[Duke of Burgundy]], Sichelm.{{sfn|Choullier|1879|p=339}}
A diploma was issued by Chlothar III in 658 or 664 that confirmed the donations made by Amalgaire.{{sfn|Choullier|1879|p=339}}
Duke Adalric lost his duchy some time between 658 and 664.{{sfn|Dupraz|1961|p=34}}
The king entrusted the lord Gengoul with the protection of the abbey.{{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}
The duke, or his son [[Adalrich, Duke of Alsace]], was restored to possession of the monastery of Bèze by the royal precept of 665.{{sfn|Dupraz|1961|p=34}}
Adalric abused his authority to ransack the abbey.{{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}
Later Adalric deserted King [[Theuderic III]] of Neustria (r. 673–691) and joined his enemies, who chose [[Dagobert II]] (r. 676–679) as King of Austrasia.{{sfn|Wood|2014|loc=PT361}}

[[File:Theuderic III.jpg|thumb|[[Theuderic III]] of Neustria]]
The war between Theuderic of Neustria and Dagobert of Austrasia once more devastated Bèze.
Waldalène had to rebuild the abbey from ruins.
In 676 Theuderic, now victorious, gave Waldalène all of Adalric's property.{{sfn|Duplus|1866|p=130}}
Adalric settled permanently in Alsace after the troubles of 675–676.{{sfn|Dupraz|1961|p=35}}
Waldalène died in 680.{{sfn|Duplus|1866|p=128}}
The abbey flourished under the three abbots that followed, Bercand or Bercang, around 680, Ferréol around 700 and Syranne around 720.{{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}

==Carolingian period (714–990)==

The [[Saracen]]s, who had conquered Spain in 714, crossed the Pyrennees and devastated the south of France.
They penetrated up the [[Rhône]], the [[Saône]] and the [[Loire]] until finally defeated by [[Charles Martel]] at the [[Battle of Tours]] in 732.{{sfn|Duplus|1866|p=65}}
The Saracens sacked the abbey of Bèze around 730.{{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}
Dom [[Jean Mabillon]] relates that they destroyed [[Autun]], pulled down the Abbey of Bèze (''monasterium Besuense''), were repulsed from [[Sens]] when they attacked it in 732, but then massacred Saint Mellin and the monks of Luxeuil Abbey.{{sfn|Lagneau|1870|p=160}}
The anthropologist Gustave Lagneau&lt;sup&gt;([[:fr:Gustave Lagneau|fr]])&lt;/sup&gt; considered that some of the present population of the region showed signs of Saracen descent.{{sfn|Lagneau|1870|p=160}}

Between 751 and 754 King [[Pepin the Short]] (r. 751–768) gave the abbey to his concubine, Angla or Anglais wife of Théodard, to be desecrated or dilapidated by her according to her caprice.{{sfn|Guillon|1817|p=38}}
Pepin also dismissed the bishop of Langres at this time, and replaced him by his brother Remi.{{sfn|Guillon|1817|p=98}}
After this the abbey was entrusted to the bishops of Langres, but due to the difficulties of the times it was only rebuilt under the Emperor [[Louis the Pious]] (r. 814–840), when Bishop Albéric restored the buildings and reintroduced discipline.{{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}

Albéric was made Bishop of Langres by Louis the Pious around 820.{{sfn|Tems|1775|p=503}}
The Chronicle of Bèze relates that Albéric was afflicted by a violent colic that made him despair of his life.
An old man appeared to him in a dream and told him he would recover if he promised to reestablish the monastery.
He made the promise and regained his health.{{sfn|Tems|1775|p=503}}
Albéric gave Bèze the church of Saint Laurent in [[Beurey]] in 830.{{sfn|Choullier|1879|p=342}}
Louis the Pious visited Langres in 830 with his son [[Lothair I|Lothair]] and held a provincial council.{{sfn|Tems|1775|p=504}}
This council and other synods seem to have resulted in the general reform that reestablished the common life of the canons and caused all the monasteries to restore their original rules.{{sfn|Mangen|1765|p=370}}
At Albéric's request Louis issued a charter that confirmed all the property of the abbey.{{sfn|Choullier|1879|p=340}}{{efn|A manuscript from Bèze states that the council at Langres in 830 granted the monks the tithes from certain vineyards donated to them by their founder. It is possible that this is a later fabrication used to support Bèze in a dispute with the canons of Langres.{{sfn|Constable|1964|p=211}} }}
Albéric repaired the church of Saint-Mammès at the abbey.{{sfn|Tems|1775|p=504}}
Alberic died in 839 and his body was taken to Bèze on 22 December 839.{{sfn|Mangen|1765|p=367}}

[[File:Kalandozasok.jpg|thumb|Hungarian campaigns in Europe]]
On 6 October 883 Geilon, bishop of Langres, gave the abbey of Bèze the relics of Saint [[Prudent de Narbonne]], which he had brought back from a chapel in [[Narbonne]] after his pilgrimage to [[Santiago de Compostela]].{{sfn|Duplus|1866|p=322}}
In 887, when marauding [[Normans]] approached the monks of Bèze transported the body of Saint Prudent to Saint-Etienne de Dijon. 
When the invasion was over the monks rebuilt the ruins of the abbey and asked for the saint's body from Dijon.{{sfn|Duplus|1866|p=323}}
The canons of Dijon at first refused, then at the command of Bishop Gauthier of Langres pretended to comply, but in fact gave the monks the body of Saint Silvin.
Eventually the ruse was discovered, and the body of Saint Prudent was carried with great ceremony from Dijon to Bèze in 931.{{sfn|Duplus|1866|p=323}}

The abbey was destroyed twice during the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe]]. It was burned in July 936 when the Hungarians came from Burgundy, and again the next year when the Hungarians had spread through France, Burgundy and Aquitaine, plundering and ravaging everywhere.{{sfn|Mangen|1765|p=414}}
The Hungarians caused so much damage to the monastery that it could not be restored for eleven years.{{sfn|Mangen|1765|p=415}}

==Golden age (990–1200)==
[[File:Guillaume de Dijon.JPG|thumb|[[William of Volpiano]], Abbot of Bèze from 990 to 1031]]
At the end of the 10th century Bruno de Roucy, Bishop of Langres, asked [[Majolus of Cluny]] to send monks to rebuild the abbeys of the Langres diocese.
Among them was [[William of Volpiano]],{{efn|Much of what is known of William of Volpiano comes from the ''Life of St William of Dijon'' by Rodulphus Glaber, a former monk at Bèze and other abbeys who finally settled at Cluny. He is not a particularly reliable source.{{sfn|Williams|1938|p=100}} }} who became abbot of Saint-Bénigne at Dijon, and was also abbot of Bèze from 990 until his death in 1031.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}
William introduced the customs of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] to both abbeys.{{sfn|Vergnolle|2001|p=234}}
The [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] is first mentioned in the Chronicle of Beze when it comes to the William, an Italian who became abbot in 990.{{sfn|O'Carroll |1953|p=414}}
Unlike Saint-Bénigne, the properties of the abbey were concentrated in the immediate vicinity, towards [[Champlitte]] and the [[Saône]].
Thanks to William's reforms Bèze attracted gifts from local nobles such as the Fouvents, descendants of the counts of Atuyer, the Beaumonts and Montsaugeons towards Langres and the Beaujeus on the Saône.{{sfn|Vergnolle|2001|p=234}}
The property included serfs. For example, in the 11th century the abbey received the serf Arnulf and "one half of the sons or daughters of the said Arnulf" for the benefit of Sir Henri de Ferté's soul.{{sfn|Coulton|2012|loc=PT40}}

Raoul le Blanc, Viscount of Dijon, became a monk at Saint-Bénigne, then was made grand-prior of Bèze under abbot William and played a major role in the restoration of the abbey.{{sfn|Débax|2008|p=269}}
Raoul dedicated his immense fortune to entirely rebuilding the abbey, including executing two ossuaries in the chapel of the Virgin and replacing the remains of the old destroyed tombs. {{sfn|Bulletin de la Société historique ... Langres 1959|p=258}}
He rebuilt the church on a larger scale, and it was dedicated in 1016 or 1018 in a ceremony arranged by Lambert de Vignory, Brunon's successor as bishop in a ceremony attended by many bishops and clergy from various provinces of France.{{sfn|Kleinclausz|1895|p=226}}
In 1018 the lord of Fouvent founded the priory of Saint-Sépulcre beside his castle, subordinate to Bèze abbey.{{sfn|Vergnolle|2001|p=234}}

Ulger or Olger 1, former prior of Beze, was abbot from 1031 to 1052.
He died on return from a pilgrimage to Jersusalem. {{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}
In October 1050 [[Pope Leo IX]] visited Langres, where he settled a dispute between the Bèze monks and the Langres canons over tithes from one of the monks' vineyards. He said that "By the authority of the Holy Fathers who preceded me in the see of Rome, it was permitted that no church founded in honour of St Peter, the prince of the Apostles, should pay a rent of tithes to another church." This silenced the canons.{{sfn|Constable|1964|p=215}} 
In 1066 a solemn assembly of bishops, abbots and local lords was held at the abbey of Bèze to settle difference between the abbot of Saint-Benigne and the officers of [[Robert I, Duke of Burgundy|Robert, Duke of Burgundy]].{{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}
In 1083 Ponce, lord of the Château de Beaujeu, gave the abbey a chapel built in honour of Saint Vallier with lands and various rights.{{sfn|Vergnolle|2001|p=234}}

Étienne de Joinville&lt;sup&gt;([[:fr:Étienne de Joinville|fr]])&lt;/sup&gt; was the son and grandson of counts on his father's side, and grandson of Arnoul, count of Reynel on his mother's side.
He served as a soldier before becoming a monk.{{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}
He was a monk at the Priory of Saint-Oyan-de-Bar and then at Cluny, where his uncle Widon was Grand Prior.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}
He was appointed prior at Sainte-Germaine de Bar-sur-Aube, then of Bar-sur-Seine.
In 1088 he was chosen as abbot of Bèze by bishop Robert.{{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}
Under the abbot Étienne de Jonvelle (c. 1088–1124) the grants multiplied, particularly in the form of restitution of churches.{{sfn|Vergnolle|2001|p=234}}
Humbert de Fouvent, who had been killed in the service of the Bishop of Langres around 1085–87, was buried at Bèze.
His widow gave the abbey the chapel of his castle, the church of Lavoncourt and two silver ''cyphes''.{{sfn|Vergnolle|2001|p=235}}
In 1093 Irmuin de Seveux gave the abbey the churches of Saint-Denis and Saint-Laurent.{{sfn|Vergnolle|2001|p=232}}
[[Pope Paschal II]] stayed at the abbey in 1107.
He was accompanied by Henry, Abbot of [[Saint-Jean-d'Angély]].{{sfn|Clark|1969|p=550}}

[[File:Paschal Alberici.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Paschal II]] ]]
Étienne doubled the size of the abbey's domain by restitution and donations, and expanded the abbey buildings, extending the church to the river.
{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}{{efn|Étienne de Joinville's epitaph says ''ecclesiae caput extendit super amnem'' (he extended the church head on the river).{{sfn|Brasart|2014}} }}
There are still remains of an axial chapel from the early 12th century.{{sfn|Lauvergeon|2000}}
This is all that is left of Étienne's buildings.
The chapels would have extended towards the Bèze river from the apse of the church.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}{{efn|The chapels today are buried due to the work of the abbot Jean de Sauveboeuf around 1680, who raised the river level to obtain a greater head of water to power the abbey forges. He dumped over 4,000 cart loads of earth and stone into the river to raise its bed.
The complaints by the people of Bèze to the Intendant of Langres about the abbot's action have been preserved.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}} }}
Under Étienne's rule the number of monks grew to about 50 living in the abbey and another 50 in subordinate priories.
The monk Jean (died 1120) wrote the ''Chronicon Besuense'', a history of the abbey from its foundation to the start of the 12th century.
The monk Teobaudus (died 1130) wrote the ''Miracula Sancti Prudentii'', which described the miraculous cures that had been effected by the relics of Saint Prudent. 
The monk Raoul the Bald wrote the ''Libri Quinque Historiae'', a history of events from 900 to 1044.
He famously wrote of the period, "At that time the kingdom of France was covered with a white cloak of churches."
In 1198 the abbey was accidentally burned.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}

==Feudalism, decline and ruin (1200–1662)==

In 1215 the abbot Albert received a letter from Pope Innocent III on the subject of damages caused by a fire which had forced the abbot to send the monks to Cluny.{{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}
In 1219 the abbey finally accepted an offer that had first been made in 1049 and sold its Clos de Bèze vineyard to the canons of Langres.{{sfn|Pitte|2012|p=48}}{{efn|The Cathedral Chapter of Saint-Mammès at Langres was the nominal owner of the Clos de Bèze vineyards until the French Revolution, but in the 17th century it leased them to lay owners.{{sfn|Coates|2008|p=83}} }} 
Over time the rule was relaxed and the monks became more concerned with temporal than spiritual matters.
In 1253 the abbot Geoffroy II was the first to hold the feudal title "Baron de Bèze".
Around 1280 the abbot Girard III built a school outside the village for children who were not destined for the church.
The building on the Place de Verdun still stands.
The archives tell of disputes between the abbot and the bishop of Langres, disputes between the monks and the people of Bèze, disputes with the local lords, disputes over feudal dues and rights of use.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}
In 1307 a dispute between the Bèze Abbey and some burgesses of the abbey was heard first by the Jours de Troyes, then escalated to the king's [[Parlement]].{{sfn|Benton|1991|p=205}}

The [[Hundred Years' War]] began in 1337.{{sfn|Seward|1999|loc=PT53}}
The [[Black Death]] appeared in [[Marseille]], then spread throughout France in 1348–49.
Some thought the world was ending, and others thought God was punishing France for her sins.{{sfn|Seward|1999|loc=PT53}}
[[Guillaume de Chanac]] became abbot in 1352. 
He later became bishop of Chartres and a cardinal.{{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}
In 1389 a complaint was lodged by 15 officers and monks of the abbey against the abbot Thiéry de Charmes concerning maladministration of the neighboring school. 
The award, issued by the court of Langes on the Saturday before [[Pentecost]], meticulously itemized the rights and duties of the abbot.
These included the requirement to supply wine to the master and clerics of Bèze to drink after [[vigils]].{{sfn|Muteau|1882|p=107}}

[[File:Bèze - Tour des Chaux.jpg|thumb|Chaix Tower in the south]]
Simon de Torcenay was abbot from 1423 until his death in 1444.
He repaired the buildings and strengthened the fortifications.{{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}
In 1425 he built the first forges on the Bèze.
He was a "warrior monk" and fortified the abbey with walls surrounded by a moat and accessed over a drawbridge
He built a second line of walls to fortify the village.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}
Around 1428 [[Claus de Werve]] made a polychromed limestone statue of the ''Virgin and Child'' for the abbey, which was installed in the Church of Saint-Martin at [[Bézouotte]] and has survived.
Construction of the fortified enclosure began in 1429.
The Chaux tower in the south and the Oysel tower in the north still stand, and carry the arms of Simon de Torcenay.{{sfn|Ancienne abbaye bénédictine ... Mérimée}}
In 1433 there was a risk of rebellion by the lords of Château-Vilain, Grancey and Vergy against the Duke of Burgundy.
On 10 May 1433 the duke addressed letters patent to the monks and people of Bèze telling them to remain faithful to the king of France and refuse entry to any stranger or enemy. 
That year he invited the abbot Simon de Torcenay, his  councilor and chamberlain, to attend a solemn ceremony of a chapter of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]].{{sfn|Béguillet|1848|p=707}}

Bèze was devastated by the war between the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] and [[Franche-Comté]], in which the Swiss invaded in 1513.
During the [[French Wars of Religion]] the Bishop of Langres supported [[Henry IV of France]] but Bèze was occupied by forces of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]].
In 1592 there were only six monks and two novices left.
With the introduction of the "''commende''" system the abbot was appointed by the king and had sole responsibility for managing the property.
Abbots, living outside the abbey, kept most of the income and granted the monks the bare minimum.
In 1615 the lay lord Charles de Ferrières was appointed abbot.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}

In 1636, as a precaution, the relics of the Abbey of Bèze were deposited with the Abbey of Saint-Bénigne in Dijon.
They were brought back from there 22 years later.{{sfn|Gaspard|1843|p=115}}
During the [[Thirty Years' War]] in 1636 the Austrian army of [[Matthias Gallas]] ravaged the [[Vingeanne]] valley.
Swedish mercenaries, nominally allies of France, destroyed what was left.
The abbey was ruined, with only a few monks left, each living in a small house they had built for themselves.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}

==Last revival (1662–1789)==
[[File:Bèze Abbey in 1690.jpg|thumb|Bèze Abbey in 1690]]
In 1662 a final revival of the monastery began with the arrival of 12 monks of the Congregation of Saint-Maur.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}
The Congregation of St Maur had been granted letters patent by [[Louis XIII of France]] in 1618 to manage the reformed monasteries of France.
It contained more than 180 monasteries by the end of the 17th century.
The congregation enforced a return to the strict Rule of Saint Benedict.
It is best known for its scholarship, including historical research, biblical studies, chronology and liturgy.{{sfn|Toke|1913}}
The abbey was probably partially rebuilt in the 17th century.{{sfn|Lauvergeon|2000}}
In 1731 the abbey and its revenues were transferred to the newly created [[Bishopric of Dijon]]. 
It was now administered by a simple "prior" rather than an abbot, and depended on the bishop for funding.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}

The Congrégation de Saint-Maur planned a reconstruction program for the abbey, with plans that provided more southern light and air to the monks' cells.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}
The buildings and Saint Peter and Paul church were destroyed and rebuilt from 1738, using materials from the old building.{{sfn|Lauvergeon|2000}}
The initial plans were changed in 1769 under the direction of the architect Charles Saint-Père, who conceived a large building south of the church.{{sfn|Ancienne abbaye bénédictine ... Mérimée}}
It had a central section holding the refectory and the dormitory, with two wings.{{sfn|Ancienne abbaye bénédictine ... Mérimée}}
Of the {{convert|113|m}} long "monastic palace",  the wings have survived but the main building, which held the cells of the monks on the first floor, has been destroyed.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}

The buildings included an infirmary, guest rooms for distinguished visitors, a library that had 4,175 volumes according to the May 1790 inventory and apartments for the Cellerier and Sous-Cellerier, who looked after the material life of the abbey.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}
The west wing held a large library on the second floor.
A cloister gallery runs along the central north side.{{sfn|Ancienne abbaye bénédictine ... Mérimée}}
There is a storehouse arranged symmetrically with the west wing.{{sfn|Ancienne abbaye bénédictine ... Mérimée}}
The church was roughly the same as the former church, but somewhat shortened and no longer extending to the river.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}

==Post-revolution (1789–present)==
[[File:Bèze - Abbaye Saint-Pierre de Bèze - 001.jpg|thumb|View from the northwest]]
At the start of the [[French Revolution]], on 2 November 1789 the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|Constituent Assembly]] decreed nationalization of the lands of the church and the religious houses.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=61}}{{sfn|Pettegree|2007|p=4}}
The monks were turned out of the abbeys and left to look after themselves.{{sfn|Wittberg|1994|p=38}}
In May 1790 the municipality of Bèze made an inventory of the monks' property. 
The last three monks left in January 1791.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}
The municipality acquired the storehouse to hold the town hall and the school.{{sfn|Ancienne abbaye bénédictine ... Mérimée}}

In August 1791 a Langres paper maker named Faitout obtained possession of the other buildings.
After a failed spinning project the abbey church began to be destroyed around 1796 and the stones sold.
The central part of the buildings was demolished in 1805.
The former "convent house" was sold in 1804 to Frédéric Rochet, an ironmaster. 
The property then passed through several hands before being acquired by the Dijon industrialist Philippe Breuil in 1872, whose descendants owned the property as of 2014.
The forges on the Belle Ile en Bèze operated until the end of the 19th century, when they were replaced by a hydroelectric power station, which operated until the 1960s.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}
Sheds, stables and an [[orangerie]] in the southwest were built after 1845 and a park laid out.{{sfn|Ancienne abbaye bénédictine ... Mérimée}}{{sfn|Lauvergeon|2000}}
The English-style park was planted with many unusual trees in the 19th century and includes a flower garden with old roses.{{sfn|Abbaye de Bèze ... Association des Amis}}

The site has a total area of {{convert|4|ha}}.{{sfn|Abbaye de Bèze ... Association des Amis}}
There are two 4-level horseshoe towers from the old enclosure.
The Oysel tower to the north has had its internal divisions destroyed.
The Chaix tower to the west has a vaulted ground floor and 2nd and 3rd floors reached by a stairway in the thickness of the wall.
Of the main structure what remains are two symmetrical buildings with basements and two floors.
There is an elongated building to the east and remains of other structures including a barrel-vaulted chapel.{{sfn|Lauvergeon|2000}}
The axial chapel survives with two pilasters and their capitals.{{sfn|Ancienne abbaye bénédictine ... Mérimée}}
The east and west wings of the 18th century convent building, the Chaux and Oysel towers including the washhouse, the floor of the old church and the axial chapel, facades, roofs and cellar structure were registered as ''[[Monument historique|Monuments Historiques]]'' on 15 September 2010.{{sfn|Ancienne abbaye bénédictine ... Mérimée}}
The property is privately owned. Both the park and gardens are open to visitors, for a small fee.{{sfn|Abbaye Saint Pierre de Bèze (4 ha)}}

[[File:Sahih_Al-Bukhari_in_English.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sahih_Al-Bukhari_in_English.png|thumb|Book of [[Sahih al-Bukhari|Sahih Bukhari]], featuring 3882 chapters.]]

A '''chapter''' is one of the main divisions of a piece of writing of relative length, such as a [[book]] of [[prose]], [[poetry]], or [[law]]. A chapter book may have multiple chapters and these can be referred to by the things that may be the main topic of that specific chapter. In each case, chapters can be numbered or titled or both.  An example of a chapter that has become well known is "Down the [[White Rabbit|Rabbit]]-Hole", which is the first chapter from ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.

==Chapter structure==

Many [[novel]]s of great length have chapters. [[Non-fiction]] books, especially those used for reference, almost always have chapters for ease of navigation. In these works, chapters are often subdivided into [[Section (writing)|sections]]. Larger works with a lot of chapters often group them in several 'parts' as the main subdivision of the book.

The chapters of reference works are almost always listed in a [[table of contents]]. Novels sometimes use a table of contents, but not always. If chapters are used they are normally numbered sequentially; they may also have titles, and in a few cases an epigraph or prefatory quotation. In older novels it was a common practice to summarise the content of each chapter in the table of contents and/or in the beginning of the chapter.

==Unusual numbering schemes==

In works of fiction, authors sometimes number their chapters eccentrically, often as a [[metafictional]] statement.  For example:
*''[[Seiobo There Below]]'' by [[László Krasznahorkai]] has chapters numbered according to the [[Fibonacci sequence]].
*''[[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]]'' by [[Mark Haddon]] only has chapters which are [[prime numbers]].
*''[[At Swim-Two-Birds]]'' by [[Flann O'Brien]] has the first page titled ''Chapter 1'', but has no further chapter divisions.
*''God, A Users' Guide'' by [[Seán Moncrieff]] is chaptered backwards (i.e., the first chapter is chapter 20 and the last is chapter 1). The novel ''[[The_Running_Man_(novel)|The Running Man]]'' by [[Stephen King]] also uses a similar chapter numbering scheme.
*Every novel in the series ''[[A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'' by [[Lemony Snicket]] has [[triskaidekaphobia|thirteen]] chapters, except the final instalment (''[[The End (A Series of Unfortunate Events)|The End]]''), which has a fourteenth chapter formatted as its own novel.
*''[[Mammoth (John Varley)|Mammoth]]'' by [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]] has the chapters ordered chronologically from the point of view of a non-time-traveler, but, as most of the characters travel through time, this leads to the chapters defying the conventional order.
*''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by [[James Joyce]] has its 18 chapters labelled as episodes, with 3 books split between them.

==Book-like==
In [[ancient civilization]]s, books were often in the form of [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]] [[scroll]]s, which contained about the same amount of text as a typical chapter in a modern book. This is the reason chapters in recent reproductions and translations of works of these periods are often presented as "Book 1", "Book 2" etc.

In the early printed era, long works were often published in multiple volumes, such as the Victorian [[Three-volume novel|triple decker novel]], each divided into numerous chapters. Modern omnibus reprints will often retain the volume divisions. In some cases the chapters will be numbered consecutively all the way through, such that "Book 2" might begin with "Chapter 9", but in other cases the numbering might reset after each part (i.e., "Book 2, Chapter 1"). Even though the practice of dividing novels into separate volumes is rare in modern publishing, many authors still structure their works into "Books" or "Parts" and then subdivide them into chapters. A notable example of this is [[The Lord of the Rings]] which consists of six 'Books', each with a recognizable part of the story, although it is usually published in three volumes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1101">'''Comedia suelta''' or simply '''suelta''' (From Spanish '[[wikt:suelto|suelto]]', "loose", "separate") was a practice of printing plays as a separate edition, often simpler than that of a book with collection of plays: cheaper paper, no binding, no cover sheet, ets. The practice was popular since early 16th century onwards. It was similar to the English practice of ''[[quarto]]'' prints popular since the [[Elizabethan era]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://teatrosiglodeoro.bne.es/DocumentosPdf/31877/031877.pdf Some Problems Posed by ''Suelta'' Editions of Plays], Don W.

'''''{{Lang|de|Die Entführung aus dem Serail}}''''' (&lt;small&gt;German:&lt;/small&gt; [[Help:IPA/Standard German|[ˈdɪ ʔɛntˈfyːʁʊŋ aʊ̯s dem zɛˈʁaɪ̯l]]]) ([[Köchel catalogue|K. 384]]; '''''The Abduction from the Seraglio'''''; also known as '''''{{Lang|it|Il Seraglio}}''''') is an [[opera]] [[Singspiel]] in three acts by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]. The German [[libretto]] is by [[Gottlieb Stephanie]], based on [[Christoph Friedrich Bretzner]]'s [[Belmont und Constanze|''Belmont und Constanze, oder Die Entführung aus dem Serail'']]. The plot concerns the attempt of the hero Belmonte, assisted by his servant Pedrillo, to rescue his beloved Konstanze from the [[seraglio]] of [[Pasha]] Selim. The work premiered on 16 July 1782 at the Vienna [[Burgtheater]], with the composer conducting.

==Origins==
The company that first sponsored the opera was the ''Nationalsingspiel'' ("national [[Singspiel]]"), a pet project (1778–1783) of the Austrian emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. The Emperor had set up the company to perform works in the German language (as opposed to the [[Italian opera]] style widely popular in Vienna). This project was ultimately given up as a failure, but along the way it produced a number of successes, mostly a series of translated works. Mozart's opera emerged as its outstanding original success.&lt;ref&gt;Manning 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

The inspector of the ''Nationalsingspiel'' was [[Gottlieb Stephanie]].&lt;ref name="abert"&gt;Abert 2007, 620&lt;/ref&gt; When the 25-year-old Mozart arrived in Vienna in 1781, seeking professional opportunity, one of the first tasks to which he addressed himself was to become acquainted with Stephanie and lobby him for an opera commission. To this end, he brought a copy of his earlier opera ''[[Zaide]]'' and showed it to Stephanie, who was duly impressed. Mozart also made a strong impression on the manager of the theater, Count [[Orsini-Rosenberg|Franz Xaver Orsini-Rosenberg]], when in the home of Mozart's friend and patroness [[Maria Wilhelmine von Thun und Hohenstein|Maria Wilhelmine Thun]] the Count heard him play excerpts from his opera ''[[Idomeneo]]'', premiered with great success the previous year in [[Munich]].&lt;ref name="abert" /&gt; With this backing, it was agreed that Stephanie would find appropriate material and prepare a libretto for Mozart. Stephanie complied by preparing an altered version of an earlier work [[Belmont und Constanze|''Belmont und Constanze, oder Die Entführung aus dem Serail'']] without attributing or seeking permission from its original author [[Christoph Friedrich Bretzner]]. Bretzner later complained loudly and publicly about the theft.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Mozart received the libretto from Stephanie on 29 July 1781. He had few opportunities to compose professionally during the summer and he set to work on the libretto at a very rapid pace, finishing three major numbers in just two days. A letter to his father [[Leopold Mozart|Leopold]] indicates he was very excited about the prospect of having his opera performed in Vienna, and worked enthusiastically on his project.

At first Mozart thought he needed to finish his opera in only two months, because tentative plans were made to perform it at the September visit of the Russian [[Paul I of Russia|Grand Duke Paul]] (son of [[Catherine the Great]] and heir to the Russian throne). However, it was ultimately decided to perform operas by [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] instead, giving Mozart more time.&lt;ref&gt;Braunbehrens 1990, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

It was around this time that Mozart articulated his views about the role of the composer and the librettist in the preparation of an opera. He wrote to his father (13 October 1781):
{{quote|text=I would say that in an opera the poetry must be altogether the obedient daughter of the music. Why are Italian comic operas popular everywhere – in spite of the miserable libretti? … Because the music reigns supreme, and when one listens to it all else is forgotten. An opera is sure of success when the plot is well worked out, the words written solely for the music and not shoved in here and there to suit some miserable rhyme ... The best thing of all is when a good composer, who understands the stage and is talented enough to make sound suggestions, meets an able poet, that true phoenix;&lt;ref&gt;By this Mozart meant something exceedingly rare. The same metaphor is used in the first scene of Mozart's later opera ''[[Così fan tutte]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; in that case, no fears need be entertained as to the applause – even of the ignorant.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Braunbehrens 1990, 61–62&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It would seem that something along these lines did happen—that is, Mozart decided to play a major role in the shaping of the libretto, insisting that Stephanie make changes for dramatic and musical effect. On 26 September Mozart wrote:
{{quote|text=Now comes the rub! The first act was finished more than three weeks ago, as was also one aria in act 2 and the drunken duet ["Vivat Bacchus", act 2] ... But I cannot compose any more, because the whole story is being altered – and, to tell the truth, at my own request. At the beginning of act 3 there is a charming quintet or rather finale, but I would prefer to have it at the end of act 2. In order to make this practicable, great changes must be made, in fact an entirely new plot must be introduced – and Stephanie is up to his neck in other work. So we must have a little patience.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Braunbehrens 1990, 77–78&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mozart was evidently quite pleased to have in Stephanie a librettist who would listen to him. The September 26 letter also says:
{{quote|text=Everyone abuses Stephanie. It may be the case he is only friendly to my face. But after all he is preparing the libretto for me – and, what is more, exactly as I want it – and by Heaven, I don't ask anything more of him.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Braunbehrens 1990, 62&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With the delays for rewriting, the composition took several more months. The premiere took place on 16 July [[1782 in music|1782]], at the [[Burgtheater]] in Vienna.

==Character==
''Die Entführung aus dem Serail'' is in the genre of "Singspiel", thus the music lacks [[recitative]]s and consists entirely of set numbers. As Hughes notes, the action is mostly carried forward by the spoken dialogue, so the libretto gave Mozart little opportunity to display an achievement for which his later operas are celebrated, namely the construction of scenes in which the plot is both reflected in and driven forward by the music.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Spike (1972:20)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Die Entführung'' is lighthearted and frequently comic, with little of the deep character exploration or darker feelings found in Mozart's later operas.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Manning 1982&lt;/ref&gt; The opera was inspired by a contemporary interest in the exotic culture of the [[Ottoman Empire]], a nation which had only recently ceased to be a military threat to Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Braunbehrens (1990, 74). Braunbehrens suggests that "preparations had just begun to celebrate" the centennial of lifting of the Turkish [[Battle of Vienna|Siege of Vienna]] in 1683. Later in the decade, Austria was again at war with Turkey (see [[Austro–Turkish War (1787–1791)]]) but this was a war of aggression, not defense.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Two contemporary works also showing the contemporary interest in matters Turkish were Giovanni Paolo Marana's ''[[Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy]]'' and [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[Persian Letters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Mozart's opera includes a [[Turkish music (style)|Westernized version of Turkish music]], based very loosely on the Turkish [[Janissary Music|Janissary band music]].

Certain aspects of the opera conform to an eighteenth-century European view of [[orientalism]]. The Pasha's titular harem, for example, reprised themes of sexual libertinage. And the comically sinister overseer, Osmin, is a send-up of earlier stereotypes of Turkish despotism.&lt;ref&gt;Osterhammel (1998) notes: "Neben das alte Bild des dämonisierten Feindes trat in der künstlerischen Repräsentation nun der übertölpelte Buffo-Türke, wie man ihn als Haremswächter Osmin auf Mozarts ''Entführung aus dem Serail'' (1782) kennt." [Next to the older image of the demonised enemy stood the over-the-top Turkish Buffoon in cultural representation, such as the Harem overseer Osmin from Mozart's ''Abduction from the Seraglio''.] p.&amp;nbsp;34&lt;/ref&gt; However, the opera also defies the stereotype of despotic Turkish culture, since its climax entails a selfless act of forgiveness on the part of the Pasha.&lt;ref&gt;Others have suggested that the Pasha is portrayed positively for acting like a Christian. This argument is made in Matthew Head – ''Orientalism, Masquerade and Mozart's Turkish Music'',{{Full citation needed|date=November 2018}} and possibly implied by Mary Hunter who says that he is "represented as European by his act of mercy" (in "The ''Alla Turca'' Style" in [[Jonathan Bellman]] (ed) – ''The Exotic in Western Music''){{Full citation needed|date=November 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The music includes some of the composer's most spectacular and difficult arias. Osmin's act 3 aria "[[O, wie will ich triumphieren]]" includes characteristic 18th century [[coloratura]] passage work, and twice goes down to a low [[D (musical note)|D]] ([[Scientific pitch notation|D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]), one of the lowest notes demanded of any voice in opera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manitobaopera.mb.ca/learn/trivia.html|title=Learn About Opera|publisher=|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most famous aria in the opera is the long and elaborate "Martern aller Arten" ("Tortures of all kinds") for Konstanze, an outstanding challenge for sopranos. Konstanze sings in a kind of [[sinfonia concertante]] with four solo players from the orchestra; the strikingly long orchestral introduction, without stage action, also poses problems for stage directors.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion, see Rosen (1997, 165) and Eisen (2006, 164–165).&lt;/ref&gt;

The virtuosity of these roles is perhaps attributable to the fact that when he took up the task of composing the opera, Mozart already knew the outstanding reputations of the singers for whom he was writing, and he tailored the arias to their strengths.&lt;ref name="abert" /&gt; The first Osmin was [[Ludwig Fischer (bass)|Ludwig Fischer]], a bass noted for his wide range and skill in leaping over large intervals with ease. Similarly, Mozart wrote of the first Konstanze, [[Caterina Cavalieri]], "I have sacrificed Konstanze's aria a little to the flexible throat of Mlle. Cavalieri."

==Reception==
[[File:Entfuhrung aus dem Serail484.jpg|thumb|Mozart (at center) attended a performance of his own opera ''Die Entführung aus dem Serail'' while [[Mozart's Berlin journey|visiting Berlin]] in 1789. Franz Frankenberg performed the role of Osmin, Friedrich Ernst Wilhelm Greibe played Pedrillo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Starší divadlo v českých zemích do konce 18. století|editor-last=Jakubcová|editor-first=Alena|authorlink= |year=2007|publisher=Divadelní ústav, Academia|location=Prague|isbn=978-80-200-1486-3|page=707|url= |language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] The opera was a huge success. The first two performances brought in the large sum of 1200 florins, three times what Mozart's salary had been for his old job in Salzburg.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch 1965, 201&lt;/ref&gt; The work was repeatedly performed in Vienna during Mozart's lifetime,&lt;ref&gt;For a listing see Deutsch 1965, 201&lt;/ref&gt; and throughout German-speaking Europe.&lt;ref&gt;See the index entry for the opera in Deutsch 1965. The Stuttgart premiere had to wait until 19 September 1795, because the singspiel ''Belmont und Constanze'', set to the same story by Christian Ludwig Dieter (1757–1822), first performed there in 1784, was so popular as to preclude any performances of Mozart's version; ''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', 5th ed, 1954, [[Eric Blom]], ed.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1787, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] wrote (concerning his own efforts as a librettist):
{{quote|text=All our endeavour ... to confine ourselves to what is simple and limited was lost when Mozart appeared. ''Die Entführung aus dem Serail'' conquered all, and our own carefully written piece has never been so much as mentioned in theater circles.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Deutsch 1965, 305. The work of his own to which Goethe refers is his ''{{Lang|de|Scherz, List und Rache}}'' which was used for an opera {{ill|Scherz, List und Rache|de|lt=of the same title}} by [[Max Bruch]] in 1858.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the opera greatly raised Mozart's standing with the public as a composer, it did not make him rich: he was paid a flat fee of 100 Imperial ducats (about 450 florins) for his work, and made no profits from the many subsequent performances.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch 1965, 202&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera reached Paris in November 1801, when [[Frédéric Blasius]] conducted Ellmenreich's company in performances at the [[Théâtre de la Gaîté (boulevard du Temple)|Théâtre de la Gaîté]].&lt;ref&gt;Noiray, Michel. "Blasius [Blassius], (Matthieu-)Frédéric" in [[Stanley Sadie]], ed., ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', 4 vols. (London: Macmillan, 1992), 1: 498&lt;/ref&gt;

This opera is firmly ensconced in the repertoire today. 

==="Too many notes"===
The complexity of Mozart's work noted by Goethe also plays a role in a well-known tale about the opera which appeared in the early (1798) biography of Mozart by [[Franz Xaver Niemetschek]]. In the version of the anecdote printed in ''[[John Bartlett (publisher)|Bartlett]]'s Book of Anecdotes'', a reference work, the story is told like this:

{{quote|text=The Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] commissioned the creation of ''The Abduction from the Seraglio'', but when he heard it, he complained to Mozart, "That is too fine for my ears – there are too many notes." Mozart replied, "There are just as many notes as there should be."&lt;ref&gt;Bernard and Fadiman (2000, 339)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The authenticity of this story is not accepted by all scholars.&lt;ref&gt;See Schmidt-Hensel, and references cited there.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the version given by the Bartlett reference (and many other places) includes a translation of the original German that is dubious. The original reads as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Cited text from: [http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/nc/ueber-uns/presse/detail/article/2006-10-16-362.html "... gewaltig viele Noten, lieber Mozart!". ''Die Mozart-Autographe der Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224154541/http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/nc/ueber-uns/presse/detail/article/2006-10-16-362.html |date=2010-12-24 }}, Exhibition notes, Berlin 2006, by Roland Dieter Schmidt-Hensel, State Library Berlin; [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation|Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz]].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Zu schön für unsere Ohren, und gewaltig viel Noten, lieber Mozart!}}

"Too many notes" is not a plausible translation of the German phrase "gewaltig viel Noten". Mautner (1956:33), translating Niemetschek, renders this as "an extraordinary number of notes", while Branscombe (2006) translates it simply as "very many notes".&lt;ref&gt;Branscombe (2006, 165)&lt;/ref&gt; The anecdote, which is often repeated, is considered by some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Beales (2006, 238–239)&lt;/ref&gt; to unfairly give the Emperor a bad reputation concerning both his own musical abilities and his appreciation and support of Mozart.

==Instrumentation==
The singers perform with a [[Classical period (music)|Classical-era]] [[orchestra]]: pairs of [[western concert flute|flute]]s (2nd doubling piccolo), [[oboe]]s, [[clarinet]]s, [[bassoon]]s, [[Natural horn|horn]]s, [[trumpet]]s, a set of two [[timpani]], and [[string section|strings]]. They are augmented with the instruments needed for [[Turkish music (style)|"Turkish" music]]: [[bass drum]], [[cymbal]]s, [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], and [[piccolo]]. The aria, "{{Lang|de|Traurigkeit ward mir zum Lose|italic=no}}", is augmented by a [[basset horn]].

The orchestra for the premiere included a number of eminent musicians of the day: first cellist [[Joseph Franz Weigl]], first oboist [[Josef Triebensee]], second horn [[Joseph Leutgeb]], and the clarinettist brothers [[Anton Stadler|Anton]] and [[Johann Stadler]]. In the first violin section was [[Josepha Weber|Franz de Paula Hofer]], who later became Mozart's brother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;Edge (1992:72–73)&lt;/ref&gt; The four musicians who played the "Turkish" instruments remain anonymous, though it is known that they were recruited for this purpose by one Franz Tyron, [[Kapellmeister]] of the Austrian Second Field Artillery Regiment.&lt;ref&gt;Edge (1992:75)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
:Place: the country house of the Pasha (German "Bassa"), in Turkey
:Time: 16th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=C. F. Bretzner|editor1-last=Bloch|editor1-first=John W.|title=The Abduction from the Seraglio (libretto)|date=1962|publisher=[[G. Schirmer]]|location=New York|page=IV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act 1===
After a lively overture, Belmonte enters, looking for his betrothed, Konstanze, who with her English servant Blonde has fallen into the hands of pirates and been sold to [[Pasha]] Selim (Aria: "Hier soll ich dich denn sehen" – "Here surely I must find her").&lt;ref&gt;English titles from ''[http://www.chandos.net/Details06.asp?CNumber=CHAN%203081 The Abduction From the Seraglio]'', [[Chandos Records]] CHAN 3081 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Osmin, the Pasha's bad-tempered servant, comes to pluck [[Common fig|fig]]s in the garden and contemptuously ignores Belmonte's questions (Aria: "Wer ein Liebchen hat gefunden" – "You may think, you've found a maiden"). Belmonte tries to obtain news of his servant, Pedrillo, who has been captured with the women and is serving as a servant in the Pasha's palace. Osmin replies with insults and abuse (Duet: "Verwünscht seist du samt deinem Liede!" – "The devil take you and your song, sir"). Belmonte leaves in disgust. Pedrillo enters and Osmin rages at him, vowing to get him tortured and killed in many different ways (Aria: "Solche hergelaufne Laffen" – "These young men who go a-spying"). Osmin leaves and Belmonte enters and happily reunites with Pedrillo. Together they resolve to rescue Konstanze and Blonde, who is Pedrillo's fiancée (Aria: "Konstanze, Konstanze, dich wiederzusehen … O wie ängstlich" – "Konstanze, Konstanze, to see thee again … Oh what trembling").

Accompanied by a chorus of [[Janissaries]] ("Singt dem großen Bassa Lieder" – "Sing to the mighty Pasha Selim"), Pasha Selim appears with Konstanze, for whose love he strives in vain (Aria of Konstanze: "Ach ich liebte" – "How I loved him"). Pedrillo tricks the Pasha into hiring Belmonte as an architect. When Belmonte and Pedrillo try to enter the palace, Osmin bars their way, but they hurry past him anyway (Terzett: "Marsch! Marsch! Marsch! Trollt euch fort!" – "March! March! March! Clear off!").

===Act 2===
[[File:John frederick lewis-reception1873.jpg|thumb|An illustration of the women's quarters in a [[seraglio]], [[John Frederick Lewis]], 1873]]
The Pasha has given Blonde to Osmin, to be his slave; however, she defiantly rebuffs her new master's rough lovemaking attempts (Aria: "Durch Zärtlichkeit und Schmeicheln" – "With smiles and kind caresses"), threatens to scratch out his eyes, and chases him out of the room (Duet: "Ich gehe, doch rate ich dir" – "I'm going, but mark what I say"). Konstanze enters and greets Blonde in distress (Aria: "Welcher Wechsel herrscht in meiner Seele … Traurigkeit ward mir zum Lose" – "Oh what sorrow overwhelms my spirit … Endless grief tortures my spirit"). The Pasha enters, demands her love, and threatens to use force, but she resolutely rejects him. (Aria: "Martern aller Arten" – "Tortures unrelenting")  Left alone, he muses on her determination to remain chaste, which increases his desire for her.

Pedrillo informs Blonde that Belmonte has come and is planning to rescue them. Blonde is filled with joy. (Aria: "Welche Wonne, welche Lust" – "Oh, the happy, happy day"). After singing a short ditty to boost his courage (Aria: "Frisch zum Kampfe" – "Now Pedrillo, now for battle!"), Pedrillo invites Osmin to drink (Duet: "Vivat [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]! Bacchus lebe!" – "Here's to Bacchus, long live Bacchus").  Despite his [[Khamr|religious prohibition against alcoholic beverages]], Osmin drinks heavily and falls asleep.  Konstanze joins Belmonte who declares his love (Aria: "Wenn der Freude Tränen fließen" – "When tears of joy flow"). The two couples reunite (Quartet, Belmonte, Konstanze, Pedrillo, Blonde: "Ach Belmonte! Ach, mein Leben" – "Ah, Belmonte, ah my dear one!"). After their initial expressions of love and joy, Belmonte and Pedrillo both question anxiously whether their respective fiancees have remained faithful during their forced separation; to their delight the women respond with indignation and dismay, and Blonde slaps Pedrillo's face. The two men apologize for their failure of confidence; the women forgive them for the offensive questions.

===Act 3===
Belmonte and Pedrillo come to the garden with ladders (Aria, Belmonte: "Ich baue ganz auf deine Stärke" – "Love, only love, can now direct me").  Pedrillo gets the attention of the women by singing a ballad about a rescue similar to the one he is planning (Romanze, Pedrillo: "In Mohrenland gefangen war" – "In Moorish lands a maiden fair"). However, Osmin enters, sees the ladders, and rouses the castle.  Osmin exults in the prospect of seeing them all hanged (Aria: "[[O, wie will ich triumphieren]]" – "My triumphant hour's approaching"). Belmonte pleads for their lives and tells Pasha Selim that his father is a Spanish [[Grandee]] and Governor of [[Oran]], named Lostados, and will pay a generous ransom. Unfortunately, Pasha Selim and Lostados are long-standing enemies. The Pasha rejoices in the opportunity to subject his enemy's son to a horrible death. He leaves Belmonte and Konstanze to bid each other a last farewell; they lovingly assure each other that being tortured to death will be a pleasure, so long as they get tortured to death together (Duet: "Welch ein Geschick! O Qual der Seele.... Weh, du soltest für mich sterben" – "What dreadful fate conspires against us.... Woe, you will die because of me"). However, the Pasha decides that he can make a better point against Lostados by showing mercy and releasing Belmonte and his friends. All are set at liberty – much to the dismay of Osmin, who would prefer to see them all brutally executed (Finale: "Nie werd' ich deine Huld verkennen" – "Your noble mercy passes measure").

==Adaptations==
The Finnish composer [[Aulis Sallinen]] wrote an opera called ''[[Palatsi (opera)|The Palace]]'' (first performed 1995); it contains characters whose names are adapted from ''Abduction'' and loosely uses elements of the plot of Mozart's opera as the starting point of a satirical fantasy.

Music professor, composer, and humorist [[Peter Schickele]] claims to have "discovered" [[P. D. Q. Bach]]'s ''[[The Abduction of Figaro]]'', a [[pastiche]] of the ''Entführung'' and Mozart's ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''.

The '''''Donne Triptych''''' (or '''''Donne Altarpiece''''') is a hinged-[[triptych]] altarpiece by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Hans Memling]]. It consists of five individual panel paintings: a central inner panel, and two double-sided wings. It was painted for [[Sir John Donne]], probably sometime between the late 1470s or early 1480s, and is in the permanent collection of the [[National Gallery]], London, with the panels still in their original frames.

When Donne commissioned the work is unknown. Art historians have debated whether it was painted in the early 1480s, around the same time Memling painted ''[[Mystic Marriage of St. Catherine (Memling)|Virgin and Child with Saints Catherine of Alexandria and Barbara]]'', in New York at the [[Metropolitan Art Museum]]. An earlier date of sometime in the late 1470s is possible, at the time he completed the similar ''[[St John Altarpiece (Memling)|St John Altarpiece]]'', or it may have been painted as a precursor to that altarpiece.&lt;ref name = "Met"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/437054 "Virgin and Child with Saints"].

The donor, Sir John Donne, was a Welsh-born diplomat for the [[House of York]] who visited Bruges at least once, in 1468 to attend [[Charles the Bold]] and [[Margaret of York]]'s wedding; how he became acquainted with Memling is as uncertain as when he commissioned the triptych.&lt;ref name ="Bruce79"&gt;Bruce, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6080">The '''epic laws of folk narrative''' were a series of principles identified by [[Axel Olrik]] for understanding the structure and form of [[Oral tradition|folktales]], and have a foundational significance in European [[Folkloristics|folklore studies]].&lt;ref&gt;‘Epic Laws of Folk Narrative’, in The Study of Folklore, ed. by [[Alan Dundes]] (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1965), pp. 129–41 (p. 129).&lt;/ref&gt;

Olrik's formulation of his 'epic laws' was inspired by an idea of [[Moltke Moe]], but whereas Moe sought to derive rules for the historical development of narratives, Olrik's approach focuses on the structure of oral narrative.&lt;ref name=Dundes85&gt;[[Alan Dundes]], ''International Folkloristics: Classic Contributions by the Founders of Folklore'', Lanham, Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1999, {{ISBN|9780847695140}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jQ6bGz4qmWsC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=Axel+Olrik,+Epic+laws&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UrzjUJPWNqjmiwLjuoHIDw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Moe%27s%20notion%20of%20epic%20laws&amp;f=false p. 85].&lt;/ref&gt; The principles were articulated in various publications, the first prominent one appearing in Danish in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Axel Olrik, 'Episke love i folkedigtningen', ''Danske Studier'', 5 (1908): 69-89 (http://danskestudier.dk/materiale/1908.pdf).&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Olrik presented the principles in German at an interdisciplinary congress in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Axel Olrik, ‘Epic Laws of Folk Narrative’, trans. by Jeanne P. Steager in ''The Study of Folklore'', ed. by [[Alan Dundes]] (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1965), pp. 129–41 (p. 129).&lt;/ref&gt;

Olrik's thought on 'epic laws' was part of a wider project, developed with [[Kristian Erslev]], for understanding oral narrative (which Olrik called ''sagn'' in Danish), also including principles for the study of sources and a theory of transmission.&lt;ref name="DBL"&gt;Bengt Holbek, [http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Historie/Folkemindeforsker/Axel_Olrik "Axel Olrik"], ''[[Dansk Biografisk Leksikon]]'', retrieved 1 January 2013 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Olrik drew on non-European material, his focus was explicitly on European folk narrative.

'''Etching''' is traditionally the process of using strong [[acid]] or [[mordant]] to cut into the unprotected parts of a [[metal]] surface to create a design in [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] (incised) in the metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/etching |title=Etching &amp;#124; Definition of etching by Merriam-Webster |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern manufacturing, other chemicals may be used on other types of material. As a method of [[printmaking]], it is, along with [[engraving]], the most important technique for [[old master print]]s, and remains in wide use today.  In a number of modern variants such as [[Etching (microfabrication)|microfabrication etching]] and [[photochemical machining|photochemical milling]] it is a crucial technique in much modern technology, including [[circuit board]]s.

In traditional pure etching, a metal (usually copper, zinc or steel) plate is covered with a waxy [[ground (drawing surface)|ground]] which is resistant to acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cairnsregionalgallery.com.au/ed-artiststudio.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Artist's Stdio : What Is Etching? |publisher=Cairnsregionalgallery.com.au |accessdate=2015-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906124255/http://www.cairnsregionalgallery.com.au/ed-artiststudio.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist then scratches off the ground with a pointed etching needle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/bosse/grand/207.htm |title=Abraham Bosse |language=fr|publisher=Expositions.bnf.fr |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he or she wants a line to appear in the finished piece, so exposing the bare metal. The échoppe, a tool with a slanted oval section, is also used for "swelling" lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/bosse/grand/209.htm |title=Abraham Bosse |language=fr|publisher=Expositions.bnf.fr |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plate is then dipped in a bath of acid, technically called the ''[[mordant]]'' ([[French language|French]] for "biting") or ''etchant'', or has acid washed over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/bosse/grand/210.htm |title=Abraham Bosse |language=fr|publisher=Expositions.bnf.fr |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acid "bites" into the metal (it dissolves part of the metal) where it is exposed, leaving behind lines sunk into the plate. The remaining ground is then cleaned off the plate. The plate is inked all over, and then the ink wiped off the surface, leaving only the ink in the etched lines.

The plate is then put through a high-pressure [[printing press]] together with a sheet of paper (often moistened to soften it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/bosse/grand/204.htm |title=Abraham Bosse |language=fr|publisher=Expositions.bnf.fr |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper picks up the ink from the etched lines, making a print. The process can be repeated many times; typically several hundred impressions (copies) could be printed before the plate shows much sign of wear. The work on the plate can also be added to by repeating the whole process; this creates an etching which exists in more than one [[State (printmaking)|state]].

Etching has often been combined with other [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] techniques such as [[engraving]] (e.g., [[Rembrandt]]) or [[aquatint]] (e.g., [[Francisco Goya]]).

==History==
[[Image:Virgin and child with cat.jpg|thumb|[[Rembrandt]], [[The Virgin and Child with a Cat]], 1654. Original copper etching plate above, example of the print below, with composition reversed.]]
{{Main|Old master print}}

===Origin===
Etching by [[goldsmith]]s and other metal-workers in order to decorate metal items such as guns, armour, cups and plates has been known in Europe since the [[Middle Ages]] at least, and may go back to antiquity. The elaborate decoration of armour, in Germany at least, was an art probably imported from Italy around the end of the 15th century—little earlier than the birth of etching as a printmaking technique. Printmakers from the German-speaking lands and Central Europe perfected the art and transmitted their skills over the Alps and across Europe. [[File:Wenzel Hollar nach Jan Meyssens.jpg|thumb|Self-portrait etched by Wenceslaus Hollar]]

[[File:BM engraved printing plates.jpg|thumb|Selection of early etched printing plates from the [[British Museum]]]]

The process as applied to printmaking is believed to have been invented by [[Daniel Hopfer]] (circa 1470–1536) of Augsburg, Germany. Hopfer was a craftsman who decorated armour in this way, and applied the method to printmaking, using iron plates (many of which still exist). Apart from his prints, there are two proven examples of his work on armour: a shield from 1536 now in the Real Armeria of Madrid and a sword in the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]] of Nuremberg. An Augsburg horse armour in the [[German Historical Museum]], [[Berlin]], dating to between 1512 and 1515, is decorated with motifs from Hopfer's etchings and [[woodcut]]s, but this is no evidence that Hopfer himself worked on it, as his decorative prints were largely produced as patterns for other craftsmen in various media. The oldest dated etching is by [[Albrecht Dürer]] in 1515, although he returned to engraving after six etchings instead of developing the craft.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Brian D. [http://artinprint.org/article/freedom-and-resistance-in-the-act-of-engraving-or-why-durer-gave-up-on-etching/ "Freedom and Resistance in the Act of Engraving (or, Why Dürer Gave up on Etching),"] &lt;i&gt;Art in Print&lt;/i&gt; Vol. 7 No. 3 (September-October 2017), 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The switch to copper plates was probably made in Italy, and thereafter etching soon came to challenge [[engraving]] as the most popular medium for artists in [[printmaking]]. Its great advantage was that, unlike engraving where the difficult technique for using the [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] requires special skill in metalworking, the basic technique for creating the image on the plate in etching is relatively easy to learn for an artist trained in drawing.  On the other hand, the handling of the ground and acid need skill and experience, and are not without health and safety risks, as well as the risk of a ruined plate.

Prior to 1100&amp;nbsp;AD, the New World [[Hohokam]] independently utilized the technique of acid etching in marine shell designs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Farb]], ''Man's Rise to Civilization'' (1978) p.205, citing [[Emil Haury|Emil Walter Haury]], ''The Hohokam: Desert Farmers and Craftsmen'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Callot's innovations: échoppe, hard ground, stopping-out===
[[Jacques Callot]] (1592–1635) from [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] in [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]] (now part of France) made important technical advances in etching technique. He developed the échoppe, a type of etching-needle with a slanting oval section at the end, which enabled etchers to create a swelling line, as engravers were able to do.
[[Image:Gärtnerin mit Korb (Belange).jpg|thumb|right|Etching by [[Jacques Bellange]], ''Gardener with basket'' c. 1612]]

Callot also appears to have been responsible for an improved, harder, recipe for the etching ground, using [[lute]]-makers' varnish rather than a wax-based formula. This enabled lines to be more deeply bitten, prolonging the life of the plate in printing, and also greatly reducing the risk of "foul-biting", where acid gets through the ground to the plate where it is not intended to, producing spots or blotches on the image. Previously the risk of foul-biting had always been at the back of an etcher's mind, preventing too much time on a single plate that risked being ruined in the biting process. Now etchers could do the highly detailed work that was previously the monopoly of engravers, and Callot made full use of the new possibilities.

Callot also made more extensive and sophisticated use of multiple "stoppings-out" than previous etchers had done. This is the technique of letting the acid bite lightly over the whole plate, then stopping-out those parts of the work which the artist wishes to keep light in tone by covering them with ground before bathing the plate in acid again. He achieved unprecedented subtlety in effects of distance and light and shade by careful control of this process. Most of his prints were relatively small—up to about six inches or 15&amp;nbsp;cm on their longest dimension, but packed with detail.

One of his followers, the Parisian [[Abraham Bosse]], spread Callot's innovations all over Europe with the first published manual of etching, which was translated into Italian, Dutch, German and English.

The 17th century was the great age of etching, with [[Rembrandt]], [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]] and many other masters. In the 18th century, [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]], [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] and [[Daniel Chodowiecki]] were the best of a smaller number of fine etchers. In the 19th and early 20th century, the [[Etching revival]] produced a host of lesser artists, but no really major figures. Etching is still widely practiced today.

==Variants==
[[Aquatint]] uses acid-resistant resin to achieve tonal effects.

Soft-ground etching uses a special softer ground. The artist places a piece of paper (or cloth etc. in modern uses) over the ground and draws on it. The print resembles a drawing.

{{further|William Blake#Relief etching}}
Relief etching was invented by [[William Blake]] in about 1788, and he has been almost the only artist to use it in [[All Religions are One#Relief etching|its original form]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/biography.xq?b=illum&amp;targ_div=d1| title = Illuminated Printing| publisher = [[William Blake Archive]]| date = 2003| accessdate = January 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, from 1880–1950 a photo-mechanical ("line-block") variant was the dominant form of commercial printing for images. A similar process to etching, but printed as a [[relief print]], so it is the "white" background areas which are exposed to the acid, and the areas to print "black" which are covered with ground. Blake's exact technique remains controversial. He used the technique to print texts and images together, writing the text and drawing lines with an acid-resistant medium.

Carbograph etching was invented in 2006 and yields an image like that of a charcoal drawing:

==Printmaking technique in detail==
[[File:Tools of etching.svg|thumb|600px|left|Steps in the typical technique]]
A waxy acid-resist, known as a ground, is applied to a metal plate, most often [[copper]] or [[zinc]] but [[steel]] plate is another medium with different qualities. There are two common types of ground: hard ground and soft ground.

Hard ground can be applied in two ways. Solid hard ground comes in a hard waxy block. To apply hard ground of this variety, the plate to be etched is placed upon a hot-plate (set at 70 degrees C), a kind of metal worktop that is heated up. The plate heats up and the ground is applied by hand, melting onto the plate as it is applied. The ground is spread over the plate as evenly as possible using a roller. Once applied the etching plate is removed from the hot-plate and allowed to cool which hardens the ground.

After the ground has hardened the artist "smokes" the plate, classically with 3 beeswax tapers, applying the flame to the plate to darken the ground and make it easier to see what parts of the plate are exposed. Smoking not only darkens the plate but adds a small amount of wax. Afterwards the artist uses a sharp tool to scratch into the ground, exposing the metal.

[[Image:Paula Modersohn-Becker Landschaft unter Bäumen.jpg|thumb|right|''Landscape under Trees'', etching by [[Paula Modersohn-Becker]], c. 1902]]

The second way to apply hard ground is by liquid hard ground. This comes in a can and is applied with a brush upon the plate to be etched. Exposed to air the hard ground will harden. Some printmakers use
oil/tar based [[asphaltum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magical-secrets.com/studio/glossary |title=Glossary &amp;#124; Magical-Secrets: A Printmaking Community |publisher=Magical-Secrets |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[bitumen]] as hard ground, although often bitumen is used to protect steel plates from rust and copper plates from aging.

Soft ground also comes in liquid form and is allowed to dry but it does not dry hard like hard ground and is impressionable. After the soft ground has dried the printmaker may apply materials such as leaves, objects, hand prints and so on which will penetrate the soft ground and expose the plate underneath.

The ground can also be applied in a fine mist, using powdered rosin or spraypaint. This process is called aquatint, and allows for the creation of tones, shadows, and solid areas of color.

The design is then drawn (in reverse) with an etching-needle or échoppe. An "echoppe" point can be made from an ordinary tempered steel etching needle, by grinding the point back on a carborundum stone, at a 45–60 degree angle. The "echoppe" works on the same principle that makes a fountain pen's line more attractive than a ballpoint's: The slight swelling variation caused by the natural movement of the hand "warms up" the line, and although hardly noticeable in any individual line, has a very attractive overall effect on the finished plate. It can be drawn with in the same way as an ordinary needle.

The plate is then completely submerged in a solution that eats away at the exposed metal. [[Iron(III) chloride|Ferric chloride]] may be used for etching copper or zinc plates, whereas nitric acid may be used for etching zinc or steel plates. Typical solutions are 1 part FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to 1 part water and 1 part nitric to 3 parts water. The strength of the acid determines the speed of the etching process.
* The etching process is known as ''biting'' (see also spit-biting below).
* The waxy resist prevents the [[acid]] from biting the parts of the plate which have been covered.
* The longer the plate remains in the acid the deeper the "bites" become.

[[Image:Aetzung Landschaft.jpg|thumb|left|Example of etching]]
During the etching process the printmaker uses a bird feather or similar item to wave away bubbles and detritus produced by the dissolving process, from the surface of the plate, or the plate may be periodically lifted from the acid bath. If a bubble is allowed to remain on the plate then it will stop the acid biting into the plate where the bubble touches it. Zinc produces more bubbles much more rapidly than copper and steel and some artists use this to produce interesting round bubble-like circles within their prints for a Milky Way effect.

The detritus is powdery dissolved metal that fills the etched grooves and can also block the acid from biting evenly into the exposed plate surfaces. Another way to remove detritus from a plate is to place the plate to be etched face down within the acid upon plasticine balls or marbles, although the drawback of this technique is the exposure to bubbles and the inability to remove them readily.

For aquatinting a printmaker will often use a test strip of metal about a centimetre to three centimetres wide. The strip will be dipped into the acid for a specific number of minutes or seconds. The metal strip will then be removed and the acid washed off with water. Part of the strip will be covered in ground and then the strip is redipped into the acid and the process repeated. The ground will then be removed from the strip and the strip inked up and printed. This will show the printmaker the different degrees or depths of the etch, and therefore the strength of the ink color, based upon how long the plate is left in the acid.

The plate is removed from the acid and washed over with water to remove the acid. The ground is removed with a solvent such as [[turpentine]]. Turpentine is often removed from the plate using methylated spirits since turpentine is greasy and can affect the application of ink and the printing of the plate.

Spit-biting is a process whereby the printmaker will apply acid to a plate with a brush in certain areas of the plate. The plate may be aquatinted for this purpose or exposed directly to the acid. The process is known as "spit"-biting due to the use of saliva once used as a medium to dilute the acid, although gum arabic or water are now commonly used.

[[Image:Félicien Rops - Pornokratès - 1878 (2).jpg|thumb|''Pornocrates'' by [[Félicien Rops]]. Etching and [[aquatint]]]]
A piece of matte board, a plastic "card", or a wad of cloth is often used to push the ink into the incised lines. The surface is wiped clean with a piece of stiff fabric known as ''[[tarlatan]]'' and then wiped with [[newsprint]] paper; some printmakers prefer to use the blade part of their hand or palm at the base of their thumb. The wiping leaves ink in the incisions. You may also use a folded piece of organza silk to do the final wipe. If copper or zinc plates are used, then the plate surface is left very clean and therefore white in the print. If steel plate is used, then the plate's natural tooth gives the print a grey background similar to the effects of aquatinting. As a result, steel plates do not need aquatinting as gradual exposure of the plate via successive dips into acid will produce the same result.

A damp piece of paper is placed over the plate and it is run through the press.

===Nontoxic etching===
Growing concerns about the health effects of acids and solvents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.princeton.edu/sites/ehs/artsafety/sec13.htm |title=Welcome to the Office of Environmental Health and Safety &amp;#124; Office of Environmental Health and Safety |publisher=Web.princeton.edu |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagoartistsresource.org/node/9287 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825165930/http://www.chicagoartistsresource.org/node/9287 |date=August 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; led to the development of less toxic etching methods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenart.info/galvetch/etchtabl.htm |title=Traditional intaglio printmaking methods, their health hazards, new non-toxic substitutes |publisher=Greenart.info |date=2013-03-14 |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 20th century. An early innovation was the use of floor wax as a hard ground for coating the plate. Others, such as printmakers Mark Zaffron and Keith Howard, developed systems using [[acrylic polymer]]s as a ground and ferric chloride for etching. The polymers are removed with sodium carbonate (washing soda) solution, rather than solvents. When used for etching, ferric chloride does not produce a corrosive gas, as acids do, thus eliminating another danger of traditional etching.

The traditional aquatint, which uses either powdered rosin or enamel spray paint, is replaced with an airbrush application of the acrylic polymer hard ground. Again, no solvents are needed beyond the soda ash solution, though a ventilation hood is needed due to acrylic particulates from the air brush spray.

The traditional soft ground, requiring solvents for removal from the plate, is replaced with water-based relief printing ink. The ink receives impressions like traditional soft ground, resists the ferric chloride etchant, yet can be cleaned up with warm water and either soda ash solution or ammonia.

Anodic etching has been used in industrial processes for over a century. The etching power is a source of direct current. The item to be etched (anode) is connected to its positive pole. A receiver plate (cathode) is connected to its negative pole. Both, spaced slightly apart, are immersed in a suitable aqueous solution of a suitable electrolyte. The current pushes the metal out from the anode into solution and deposits it as metal on the cathode. Shortly before 1990, two groups working independently&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Behr | first = Marion | last2 = Behr | first2 = Omri | title = Environmentally safe Etching | journal = Chem Tech | volume = 21 | issue = #4 | pages = 210– | year = 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nick|first1=Semenoff|last2=Christof|first2=C.|title=Using Dry Copier Toners in Intaglio and Electro-Etching of metal Plates|journal=Leonardo|date=1999|volume=24|issue=4|pages=389–394|doi=10.2307/1575513|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed different ways of applying it to creating intaglio printing plates.

Some of the earliest printmaking workshops experimenting with, developing and promoting nontoxic techniques include Grafisk Eksperimentarium, in Copenhagen, Denmark, Edinburgh Printmakers, in Scotland, and [[New Grounds Print Workshop]], in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

===Photo-etching===
[[File:2013 12 diciembre (30)2.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Luca Giordano]], 18th century]]
{{main|Photochemical machining}}
Light sensitive polymer plates allow for photorealistic etchings. A photo-sensitive coating is applied to the plate by either the plate supplier or the artist. Light is projected onto the plate as a negative image to expose it. Photopolymer plates are either washed in hot water or under other chemicals according to the plate manufacturers' instructions. Areas of the photo-etch image may be stopped-out before etching to exclude them from the final image on the plate, or removed or lightened by scraping and burnishing once the plate has been etched. Once the photo-etching process is complete, the plate can be worked further as a normal intaglio plate, using [[Drypoint|drypoint]], further etching, engraving, etc. The final result is an intaglio plate which is printed like any other.

==Types of metal plates==
[[File:Insekto_(1976)_01.jpg|thumb|Insekto [[Lito Mayo]], Philippines,1976]]
{{main|Photochemical machining}}

[[Copper]] is a traditional metal, and is still preferred, for etching, as it bites evenly, holds texture well, and does not distort the color of the ink when wiped. [[Zinc]] is cheaper than copper, so preferable for beginners, but it does not bite as cleanly as copper does, and it alters some colors of ink. [[Steel]] is growing in popularity as an etching substrate. Increases in the prices of copper and zinc have steered steel to an acceptable alternative. The line quality of steel is less fine than copper, but finer than zinc. Steel has a natural and rich aquatint.

The type of metal used for the plate impacts the number of prints the plate will produce. The firm pressure of the printing press slowly rubs out the finer details of the image with every pass-through. With relatively soft copper, for example, the etching details will begin to wear very quickly, some copper plates show extreme wear after only ten prints. Steel, on the other hand, is incredibly durable. This wearing out of the image over time is one of the reasons etched prints created early in a numbered series tend to be valued more highly. An artist thus takes the total number of prints he or she wishes to produce into account whenever choosing the metal.

==Industrial uses==
{{Main|Chemical milling}}
{{See also|Etching (microfabrication)}}
Etching is also used in the manufacturing of [[printed circuit board]]s and [[semiconductor device]]s, and in the preparation of metallic specimens for microscopic observation.

==Controlling the acid's effects==
There are many ways for the printmaker to control the acid's effects.

===Hard grounds===
[[Image:Lesser Ury Junges Mädchen im Café.jpg|thumb|right|''Young Girl in cafe with street-view'', etching by [[Lesser Ury]], 1924]] 
Most typically, the surface of the plate is covered in a hard, [[wax]]y 'ground' that resists acid. The printmaker then scratches through the ground with a sharp point, exposing lines of metal which the mordant acid attacks.[[File:Sugar Lift and Spit Bite Effects.jpg|thumb|left|Example of sugar lift and spit bite effect]]

===Aquatint===
[[Aquatint]] is a variation in which particulate resin is evenly distributed on the plate, then heated to form a screen ground of uniform, but less than perfect, density. After etching, any exposed surface will result in a roughened (i.e., darkened) surface. Areas that are to be light in the final print are protected by varnishing between acid baths. Successive turns of varnishing and placing the plate in acid create areas of tone difficult or impossible to achieve by drawing through a wax ground.

===Sugar lift===
Here designs in a syrupy solution of sugar or [[Camp Coffee]] are painted onto the metal surface prior to it being coated in a liquid etching ground or 'stop out' varnish. When later the plate is placed in hot water the sugar dissolves and lifts off leaving the image. The plate can then be etched.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ghost-ships-nick-richards.jpg|thumb|right|A contemporary example of Etching with spit-bite - 'Ghost Ships' (2012) by [http://www.nick-richards.com/project/ghost-ships/ Nick Richards RCA].]] --&gt;

===Spit bite===
A mixture of nitric acid and [[Gum Arabic]] (or almost never – saliva) which can be dripped, spattered or painted onto a metal surface giving interesting results. A mixture of nitric acid and [[rosin]] can also be used.

==Printing==
[[File:Cylinder press at SCAD-Lacoste in Vaucluse, France.jpg|thumb|right|Cylinder press for printing etchings]] Printing the plate is done by covering the surface with [[printing ink]], then rubbing the ink off the surface with ''[[tarlatan]]'' cloth or newsprint, leaving ink in the roughened areas and lines. Damp paper is placed on the plate, and both are run through a [[printing press]]; the pressure forces the paper into contact with the ink, transferring the image (''c.f.'', [[chine-collé]]). Unfortunately, the pressure also subtly degrades the image in the plate, smoothing the roughened areas and closing the lines; a [[copper]] plate is good for, at most, a few hundred printings of a strongly etched imaged before the degradation is considered too great by the artist. At that point, the artist can manually restore the plate by re-etching it, essentially putting ground back on and retracing their lines; alternatively, plates can be [[electroplating|electro-plated]] before printing with a harder metal to preserve the surface. [[Zinc]] is also used, because as a softer metal, etching times are shorter; however, that softness also leads to faster degradation of the image in the press.

==Faults==
[[File:Foul Bite through Soft Ground on Zinc.jpg|thumb|Example of foul bite in acid etching]]

''Foul-bite'' or "over-biting" is common in etching, and is the effect of minuscule amounts of acid leaking through the ground to create minor pitting and burning on the surface. This incidental roughening may be removed by smoothing and polishing the surface, but artists often leave faux-bite, or deliberately court it by handling the plate roughly, because it is viewed as a desirable mark of the process.

=="Etchings" euphemism== &lt;!-- This is linked from the redirect [[Come up and see my etchings]] --&gt;
The phrase "Want to come up and see my etchings?" is a romantic euphemism by which a person entices someone to come back to their place with an offer to look at something artistic, but with ulterior motives. The phrase is a corruption of some phrases in a novel by [[Horatio Alger, Jr.]] called ''The Erie Train Boy'', which was first published in 1891. Alger was an immensely popular author in the 19th century—especially with young people—and his books were widely quoted. In chapter XXII of the book, a woman writes to her boyfriend, "I have a new collection of etchings that I want to show you. Won't you name an evening when you will call, as I want to be certain to be at home when you really do come." The boyfriend then writes back "I shall no doubt find pleasure in examining the etchings which you hold out as an inducement to call."

This was referenced in a 1929 [[James Thurber]] cartoon in which a man tells a woman in a building lobby: "You wait here and I'll bring the etchings down".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/cartoonists/2011/09/sexual-revolutions.html |title=My Sexual Revolution |author=Robert Mankoff |publisher=Newyorker.com |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also referenced in [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s 1934 novel ''[[The Thin Man]]'', in which the narrator answers his wife asking him about a lady he had wandered off with by saying: "She just wanted to show me some French etchings."&lt;ref&gt;Hammett, Dashiell, ''The Thin Man'', (1934) in Five Complete Novels, New York: Avanel Books, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;592.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was given new popularity in 1937: in a well publicized case, violinist [[David Rubinoff]] was accused of inviting a young woman to his hotel room to view some French etchings, but instead seducing her.

As early as 1895, [[Hjalmar Söderberg]] used the reference in his "[[Decadent movement|decadent]]" [[debut novel|début novel]] ''Delusions'' (swe: ''Förvillelser)'', when he lets the dandy Johannes Hall lure the main character's younger sister Greta into his room under the pretence that they browse through his etchings and engravings (e.g., ''[[Die Sünde]]'' by [[Franz Stuck]]).&lt;ref&gt;Förvillelser, Lind &amp; Co., 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;158—163&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fish and Elephant''''' ({{zh|c=今年夏天|p=Jīn nián xià tiān|l=This summer}}) is documentary filmmaker and former TV hostess [[Li Yu (director)|Li Yu]]'s [[feature film]] [[directorial debut]]. The film is also often referred to as the first Chinese mainland film to broach the topic of [[lesbian]] relationships in China.&lt;ref name=Kraicer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinesecinemas.org/fishandelephant.html|title=Fish and Elephant: review by Shelly Kraicer|author=Kraicer, Shelly|publisher=Chinesecinemas.org|accessdate=2008-01-29|date=2002-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ADI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianlife.com/ext/magazine/viewArticles/id/23641052|title =

The story follows the elephant keeper in the [[Beijing Zoo]] who maintains an aquarium of fish in her home (hence the two-animal title), and her lesbian lover, a fabric saleswoman in an outdoor market. Her relationship is tested, however, when her recently divorced mother returns to town in the hope of setting her daughter up in marriage. Further complicating matters is one of Xiaoqun's ex-lovers also returning to her life with the law in pursuit.

The film was produced by Cheng Yong Productions and was an "underground" production (in that it was not made with official support). Moreover, the film was cast entirely with non-professional actors and actresses.&lt;ref name=Kraicer/&gt;

==Cast==
* '''Pan Yi''' as '''Xiaoqun''', the elephant keeper at the Beijing Zoo.
* '''Shitou''' as '''Xiaoling''', Xiaoqun's girlfriend, she sells clothes she makes in a market stall.
* '''Zhang Qianqian''' as '''Junjun''', Xiaoqun's ex-girlfriend. She re-enters Xiaoqun's life a fugitive, wanted for the murder of her father.
* '''Zhang Jilian''' as '''Xiaoqun's mother''', a divorcee who is unaware of her daughter's sexual orientation. She attempts to set her daughter up on a series of blind dates.

==Production==
Filmed on an almost-square 16&amp;nbsp;mm format,&lt;ref name=Kraicer/&gt; ''Fish and Elephant'' was the first feature film by [[Li Yu (director)|Li Yu]], who had previously directed several documentaries, including 1997's ''Sisters'', a film which had run into state interference.&lt;ref name=AMA&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.amamedia.org/movies/showcase/02showcase/fish_and_elephant.html|title =2002 China Film Showcase: Fish and Elephant|publisher =Asia Media Access|date =2002|accessdate =2008-02-02|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080120195650/http://www.amamedia.org/movies/showcase/02showcase/fish_and_elephant.html|archivedate =2008-01-20|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casting by Li Yu was done entirely with non-professionals. The two leads, Xiaoqun (Pan Yi) and Xiaoling (Shitou), were cast after Li began visiting various lesbian bars in [[Beijing]]. Similarly, several of the film's "blind dates" were based on actual dates set up by Li through classified ads. The men's reactions upon Xiaoqun revealing her sexual orientation therefore are entirely natural and accurate.&lt;ref name=Kraicer/&gt; Some have reported that this focus on amateurs was only partially by choice, in that Li had been unable to sign on established talent due to the controversial script and story.&lt;ref name=ADI/&gt;

==Release==

===International and domestic film festivals===
Once the film's production was complete, it faced several challenges before it could be seen by audiences. Due to its underground status, Li Yu did not have the support of the Chinese authorities. An attempt to deliver a print to the Venice Film Festival in 2001 led to it being lost.&lt;ref name=Kraicer/&gt; Later screenings, therefore, like at the Toronto Film Festival, for example, had to be on [[videotape]] instead of a film reel.&lt;ref name=Kraicer/&gt; Fortunately for Li, copies of ''Fish and Elephant'' eventually managed to screen at over 70 different film festivals around the world.&lt;ref name=SHR&gt;International Bar Association, et al. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gem-0JOOWVMC ''Sexuality and Human Rights'']. Haworth Press, p. 182. {{ISBN|1-56023-555-1}}. Google Book Search. Retrieved 2008-10-14&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it was shown only once in Mainland China at a LGBT film festival that was quickly shut down by authorities.&lt;ref name=SHR/&gt;

===DVD release===
''Fish and Elephant'' was released on [[DVD]] in the United States by the [[LGBT]]-focused distributor, [[Ariztical Entertainment]] on May 23, 2006. The edition features the original [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin-language]] dialogue and includes English subtitles.

==Reception==
Upon its dissemination to international audiences, ''Fish and Elephant'' was praised for being groundbreaking in subject matter, but mediocre in execution. ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out New York]]'', for example,
though generally positive in its praise also noted that there was "nothing here to surprise western viewers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/newyork/reviews/66729/Fish_and_Elephant.html |title=Fish and Elephant movie review |publisher=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out New York]] |accessdate=2008-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222004408/http://www.timeout.com/film/newyork/reviews/66729/Fish_and_Elephant.html |archivedate=2008-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese film critic Shelly Kraicer, meanwhile, analyzed the film and concluded, "[''Fish and Elephant's''] flaws are those, entirely forgivable, of a first film, of a novice director who really wants to try to cram all of her ideas into one work."&lt;ref name=Kraicer/&gt; The film's release was similarly noted by the film criticism website ''Senses of Cinema'', which stated that, "''Fish and Elephant'' might be overlooked by film festivals in favour of other more glossy underground Chinese films produced this year...", but the author would nonetheless "recommend it and will keep an eye out for [Li Yu's] future works."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/festivals/01/17/vancouver.html|title=The 20th Vancouver International Film Festival - A Report|author=Roose-Runge, Lisa|publisher=Senses of Cinema|date=October 2001|accessdate=2008-02-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080116153602/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/festivals/01/17/vancouver.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first recipients of the [[Royal Designers for Industry]] distinction in 1937, he is remembered for his work for the [[D’Oyly Carte Opera Company]].

==Life and career==
Sheringham was born in London, the son of an [[Anglican]] clergyman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=SHERINGHAM, Rev. Harry Alsager|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=1598|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1598}} Rev. Sheringham was the father of George and Hugh, the Angling Editor for [[The Field (magazine)|''The Field'']].&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the King’s School, [[Gloucester]], the [[Slade School]] of Art (1899–1901), and the [[Sorbonne]], Paris (1904–06).

'''Glasgow Art Club''' is a club for practising and retired artists and lay members with an interest in the arts, that has become over the generations “a meeting place for artists, business leaders and academics.”&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/treasures-of-a-city-institution-to-be-shared-as-art-club-opens-its-doors-1.994878 The Herald Scotland article 29 December 2009] Retrieved 2011-08-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Following initial discussions at a tea room above a baker’s shop in [[Candleriggs]], Glasgow, on the proposal to form a club, the first formal meetings of the club were held at the Waverley Temperance Hotel, on [[Buchanan Street]], Glasgow, with Dennistoun elected the club’s first president.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WZNEAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lbUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2941,5814965&amp;dq=glasgow+art+club&amp;hl=en Glasgow Herald article 6 June 1893 ''Glasgow Art Club''] Retrieved 2011-08-17&lt;/ref&gt; Membership was to grow during the 1870s, with professional artists joining and exhibitions being held and in 1875 the club moved to another hotel called the Waverley, this time one on the city’s [[Sauchiehall Street]]. From there the club was to relocate to the Royal Hotel on the city’s [[George Square]], renting rooms for six months at a time, where life and sketching classes were held.

Membership of the club began to be extended beyond painters (in 1881 the pioneering photographer [[James Craig Annan]] was admitted as a ‘’photographic artist’’&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/smgpubs/access/998716441.html?dids=998716441:998716441&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+05%2C+2006&amp;author=ALAN+TAYLOR&amp;pub=Sunday+Herald&amp;desc=REVEALED%3A+THE+SECRET+OF+THE+GLASGOW+BOY%2C+THE+ROYAL+PAINTING+AND+SOME+OLD+PHOTOGRAPHIC+PLATES+HIDDEN+IN+A+DUSTY+ARCHIVE&amp;pqatl=google Article Sunday Herald 5 March 2006] Retrieved 2011-08-17&lt;/ref&gt;  and in 1903 John M.

In 1878 the club moved to rented premises at 62 Bothwell Street&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  and the need to raise funds led to a change in the club’s constitution and the admission in 1886 of male lay members with an interest in the arts (admission of women not extended until 1982.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-_89AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fkkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4926,6089733&amp;dq=glasgow+art+club&amp;hl=en Glasgow Herald article 27 March 1982 ''Club opens its doors to women after 100 years''] Retrieved 2011-08-17&lt;/ref&gt; ) With membership burgeoning new premises were rented at 151 Bath Street, these formally opened on 12 November 1886&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4llEAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9bEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4801,3489443&amp;dq=glasgow+art+club&amp;hl=en Glasgow Herald article 13 November 1886 ''Glasgow Art Club''] Retrieved 2011-08-17&lt;/ref&gt;  but soon afterwards two adjacent town houses on Bath Street were purchased, these converted by the architect [[John Keppie]], a member of the club, creating also an exhibition gallery in what were the back gardens of the adjacent houses.

The club’s stature in Glasgow was confirmed when on the occasion of the official opening by the Prince of Wales of the [[International Exhibition of Science, Art and Industry|Glasgow International Exhibition of Science, Art and Industry]] in 1888, the [[Lord Provost]] of Glasgow presented the Prince and Princess of Wales with an album of paintings by members of the Glasgow Art Club.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=w_ORaKkuc5QC&amp;dat=18880721&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en The Sydney Mail article 21 July 1888 ''The Glasgow Exhibition''] Retrieved 2011-08-17&lt;/ref&gt; In the succeeding years the club has played host to many events, including, on the evening of 28 October 1932 a dinner honouring [[James Pittendrigh Macgillivray|Dr. Pittendrigh Macgillivray]] [[Royal Scottish Academy|RSA]], King’s [[Sculptor in Ordinary for Scotland]] a member of the Club for some fifty years, and club member James B.

==History==

===Formation (2012)===
[[File:zarapeerzada-itp.jpg|thumb|right|250px| [[Zara Peerzada]] as "Saugandi" in [[Saadat Hasan Manto|Manto]]'s ''Hatak (Insult)'' directed by Azeem Hamid at Alhamra Arts Council, [[Lahore]], in 2012]]
The company was founded in 2012 by [[Azeem Hamid]] and Danyaal Syed and now operates all across theatres in [[Lahore]]: [[Alhamra Arts Council]] and [[Ali Institute of Education|Ali Auditorium]] (for classical [[Urdu language|Urdu]] &amp; [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays and musicals) and different educational institutes (for theatre workshops &amp; short plays).

Their first theatrical production ''Hatak'' (literal meaning: ''Insult''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jang.com.pk/thenews/Nov2012-weekly/nos-04-11-2012/she.htm#4 | title=Shehr, NOS, Town Talk | publisher=Jang.com | access-date=2015-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; featured fashion model and actress [[Zara Peerzada]] in the lead role,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newslinemagazine.com/2014/07/interview-zara-peerzada/ | title=Interview: Zara Peerzada | publisher=newslinemagazine.com | accessdate=2015-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was based on the short-story of famous Urdu writer [[Saadat Hassan Manto]], staged in November 2012 at Alhamra Arts Council and received positive reviews from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CkBwLYzCDs | title=Drama 'Hatak' presented in Alhamra report by Raza Zaidi| publisher=City42  | accessdate=2015-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the group collaborating with [[Beaconhouse School System|Beaconhouse School Liberty]] for a theatrical performance ''Dareecha'', based loosely on the writings of the play ''Qurtaba Ka Qazi'' written by [[Imtiaz Ali Taj]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jang.com.pk/thenews/Nov2012-weekly/nos-11-11-2012/she.htm#3 | title=Shehr, NOS, Town Talk Nov 11-2012 | publisher=Jang.com | accessdate=2015-01-08  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years (2013)===
In 2013, the group initiated their year with two short-length plays; ''Dastak (The Knock)'', a play written by [[Meerza Adeeb]] and an original, ''Awaaz (Voice)'', in collaboration with [[Lahore Grammar School]], the latter winning two-awards at Colors &amp; Humour 2013 for the best actress &amp; supporting actor roles. This success was later followed by a sold-out performance of [[Ashfaq Ahmed]]'s tele-play stage adaptation ''Fehmida Ki Kahani, Ustaani Rahat Ki Zubani'' in March, the performance was praised by many literature writers including [[Ayub Khawar]]. The group went on to perform [[Rajinder Singh Bedi]]'s classical satire ''Naql-e-Makani (Moving to a New House)'' from 4th till 6 October,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxP_cLCyMZ4 | title=Famous Novel 'Naql-e-Makani' by Rajinder Singh Bedi to be performed in Lahore report by Mukarram Kaleem| publisher=City42  | accessdate=2015-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was well received by critics and the audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archives.dailytimes.com.pk/national/05-Oct-2013/bedi-s-naql-e-makani-being-staged-at-ali-auditorium | title=Bedi's 'Naql-e-Makani' being staged at Ali Auditorium | publisher=Daily Times | accessdate=2015-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PAR2ZuFX8A | title='Naql-e-Makani' report by Mukarram Kaleem| publisher=City42  | accessdate=2015-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, Azeem Hamid directed ''Kuttay'', a satirical performance based on the writings of [[Nadeem F. Paracha]]'s article ''Dog Gone''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1046970 | title=Dog Gone by Nadeem F. Paracha  | publisher=Dawn News | accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a mock to society. The performance won the [[Imtiaz Ali Taj]] award at a festival held in Lahore, [[Pakistan]].

===International success (2014–2015)===
The following year, it produced several performances, which included ''Jhelum Mein Naupar'' ''(The Sailing Boat in Jhelum)'' featuring stage actress [[Amtul Baweja]] and an adaptation of [[Reginald Rose]]'s famous film ''[[Twelve Angry Men]]'' as ''[[Twelve Angry Men (play)|Twelve Angry Jurors]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://issuu.com/pakistantoday-paperazzi/docs/pakistan_today_paperazzi_issue_25_f | title=Paperazzi Magazine Issue #25  | publisher=Paperazzi Magazine | accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; at different venues in Lahore. In summers, the group went on their first international tour at the [[SPIC MACAY|2nd International SPIC MACAY Convention]] held in [[Chennai]], [[Madras]], [[India]] where they collaborated with [[Koodiyattam]] master Margi Madhu from the [[Chakyar]] clan for the  classical [[Sanskrit theatre]] performance of ''Anguliyankam (The Golden Ring)'' in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/beyond-boundaries/article6152740.ece | title=Beyond Borders  | publisher=The Hindu| accessdate=2016-04-04  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:faizan-itp.jpg|thumb|left|250px| [[Saadat Hasan Manto|Manto]]'s ''Kamra #9 (Room No. 9)'' directed by Azeem Hamid at [[Alhamra Arts Council]], [[Lahore]], in 2014. Visible from left to right: Faizan Naveed as "Nasir", Namwar Ayaz as "Zamaan" and Zoya Uzair as "Shireen".]]
 
In December, the company went on to produce their best known theatrical performance ''[[Kamra No. 9]] (Room No. 9)'' a [[radio play]] written by [[Saadat Hasan Manto]] and directed by Azeem Hamid. The performance was well received by critics and audiences, the ''[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]'' wrote "''Kamra #9'' ... mystery musical is an example of [[Urdu Theater|Urdu theatre]] at its finest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/entertainment/12-Dec-2014/kamra-9-opens-in-lahore | title=Kamra #9 opens in Lahore.| publisher=Daily Times| accessdate=2016-04-04  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shoaib Ahmed (journalist)|Shoaib Ahmed]] of ''[[Dawn Newspaper]]'' wrote "The 60-minute three-act play had such a strong production value that it kept glued the audience to their seats till the end. The literary piece was deeply and meaningfully tailored for the play.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1150088/mantos-kamra-number-9-at-alhamra | title=Manto’s Kamra Number 9 at Alhamra | publisher=Dawn News | accessdate=2015-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; while during an interview to ''[[The Express Tribune]]'', director Azeem Hamid said, "Visualising and creating a 1930s [[Delhi]] feel for a radio play was an immense challenge; we walked around Jalander, India to get inspiration for ''Kamra #9’s'' set design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/805298/a-room-full-of-mantos-imagination/ | title=A room full of Manto’s imagination | publisher=The Express Tribune | accessdate=2015-01-08  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Mani-Nama]]'' blog reviewed the performance saying, "The set was quite modest- a realistic one with an old radio, telephone and chairs. After sometime I witnessed some quality lighting which was done by Shakeel Siddique, who literally set the pace of play with classic lights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://the-mani-nama.blogspot.com/2014/12/by-hammad-anwar-follow-manihammad-about.html | title=Meeting Manto`s mysterious occupant of Kamra#9| publisher=The Mani-Nama Blog| accessdate=2016-04-04  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The News International|The News on Sunday]]'' wrote, "''Kamra #9'' provided insight into human complexities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tns.thenews.com.pk/manto-play-kamra-number-9-on-stage/#.VwQ54uaxkXh | title=Kamra with a view| publisher=The News on Sunday| accessdate=2016-04-04  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aleeza Rasool]], writer and critic, of ''[[Youlin Magazine]]'' reported praising the performance as she wrote, "Firstly, a radio play by Manto was a refreshing choice, for it is one of the lesser-known genres that Manto composed during his brief lifetime. Secondly, the play was very well-acted, and most importantly, the direction was even-tempered, making the play engaging., adding that, "It is unusual to come across the genus of anticipation and suspense in [[Theatre in Pakistan|Pakistani stage plays]], which is why Azeem Hamid, actor and director of the play, deserves a pat on the back for putting up a wonderful performance on Manto’s radio play."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.youlinmagazine.com/blog/stage-play-kamra-no-9/MTA3 | title=The Mysterious Resident of Kamra No. 9| publisher=Youlin Magazine| accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the success in Pakistan, the company went on to perform ''Kamra No. 9'' in [[West Bengal]], India to promote peace between the two bordering nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1141225/jsp/siliguri/story_5164.jsp | title=Santipur stage for theatre festival| publisher=The Telegraph India | accessdate=2015-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an interview with ''[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]]'', "For the past few years, the theatre and cultural activists have been protesting in various ways against fanaticism, trying their best to educate people in rural areas, organising workshops in schools and colleges and staging street theatres. We were hopeful that a peaceful atmosphere would gradually emerge. The [[2014 Peshawar school massacre|Peshawar killings]] have come as an eye-opener," [[Zoya Uzair]], who played the lead role of 'Shireen', said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1141228/jsp/bengal/story_19267064.jsp  | title=Pak Theatre's message of Peace| publisher=The Telegraph India| accessdate=2016-04-04  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's director Azeem Hamid received an 'Address of Honour' from [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|MLA]] [[Ajoy Dey]] of the [[Santipur (Vidhan Sabha constituency)|Santipur Municipality]] for staging and directing ''Kamra No. 9'' in West Bengal. [[File:rashidmehmood-itp.jpg|thumb|right|250px| [[Rashid Mehmood (actor)|Rashid Mehmood]] starred as "Fakir" alongside Shafaq Yousuf as "Munni" in ''Sammi Di Vaar'' staged in [[Lahore]], 2015.]]

In 2015, director Azeem Hamid said in an interview to ''[[My Awesome Journey]]'' that "I decided to revamp ITP. I had been scouting a team of professionals that would be useful in creating intelligent theatre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.myawesomejourney.com/?p=645  | title=Meet: The Very Talented – Azeem Hamid, Founder and CEO at Independent Theatre Pakistan| publisher=My Awesome Journey| accessdate=2016-04-04  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company supported 'The End Polio Now' campaign organized by [[Rotary International]] at [[Alhamra Arts Council]], [[Lahore]] and performed an original monologue ''Scream'' at the event. In December, the group produced a set of three theatrical performances, ''3 Kahaniyan (Three Stories)'' which featured ''Bu (Odour)'' an original play written by [[University of Regina]] graduate Ayesha Mohsin having previously worked with [[CJTR-FM]], a [[Punjabi language]] play ''Sammi Di Vaar  (Sammi's Life)'' written by [[Najm Hosain Syed]] and directed by Mehreen Mir from [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts]], [[London]] which featured famous Pakistani film actor [[Rashid Mehmood (actor)|Rashid Mehmood]], and a stage adaptation of [[Saadat Hasan Manto]]'s short-story ''Badshahat Ka Khatma (Kingdom's End)'' by Azeem Hamid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1218888 | title=Theatre group unfolds ‘3 Kahaniyan’ from 30th| publisher=Dawn News| accessdate=2016-04-04  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theworldofhsy.com/independent-theater-pakistan/ | title=3 Kahaniyan: Independent Theatre Pakistan| publisher=The World of HSY| access-date=4 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2015/11/28/entertainment/teen-kahaniyan-is-ready-to-buzkasha/ | title=Teen Kahaniyan is ready to BUZKASHA!| publisher=Pakistan Today| access-date=4 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Pakistan Today]]'' reported that ''3 Kahaniyan'' received a mixed reception from critics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2015/12/01/entertainment/3-kahaniyan-finally-told/| title=Teen Kahaniyan finally told| publisher=Pakistan Today| access-date=4 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Faizan Javed of ''[[The Nation (Pakistan)|The Nation]]'' praised the performance writing "The immediate response of the audience determines the quality of play being stage. And when it comes to social message for the audience the impact is everlasting. The play ''3 Kahaniyan'' being staged at [[Alhamra Arts Council|Alhamra Hall]] on [[Mall Road, Lahore|Mall Road]] is an example."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=3 December 2015 | url=http://nation.com.pk/entertainment/03-Dec-2015/absurdity-in-all-its-right| title=Absurdity in all its right| publisher=The Nation| access-date=4 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise to fame (2016)===
In March, the company produced the theatrical adaptation of [[Neil Simon]]'s [[Farce|farcical]] play ''[[Rumors (play)|Rumors]]'', which was praised and supported by well known celebrities and film stars like [[Agha Ali]], [[Cybil J.

We should appreciate the young talent because these young people are our future”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nation.com.pk/entertainment/07-Apr-2017/tamasha-festival-begins-in-lahore | title=Tamasha begins in Lahore| publisher=The Nation | accessdate=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Director of [[Polyglot Theatre]], Sue Giles said that through theatre, we achieve an opportunity to present space and time to subjective experience and nourish the child’s brain power. “The idea of ‘value for money’ is another issue how people perceive the place and power of children in our midst. We neglect our children’s physical freedoms we once had,” Sue added. While the session ‘Society and Drama’ highlighted the issues of theatre industry in both countries Pakistan and Korea. The session was moderated by [[Azeem Hamid]] and the panelists were renowned writer [[Asghar Nadeem Syed]] and [[Seok Hong-Kim]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nation.com.pk/lahore/09-Apr-2017/tamasha-day-2 | title=Tamasha Day 2| publisher=The Nation | accessdate=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's director, Azeem Hamid in a radio interview to [[Fifi Haroon]] from ''[[BBC Urdu]]'' said, "Teaching creative expressions like theatre play an important role in building confidence skills, enhancing leadership qualities and empowering empathy to children. Storytelling methods and techniques are very vital to teach a subject much more creatively to a student."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.com/urdu/multimedia/2015/09/150920_rabt_interview_fifi_sq| title=’بچوں کو سوال کرنے دیں‘| publisher=BBC Urdu| accessdate=2016-04-04  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group have collaborated extensively with leading [[Private school|private]] as well as public educational institutions such as [[Lahore Grammar School]], [[The City School (Pakistan)|The City School]], [[Beaconhouse School System]], [[Beaconhouse National University]], [[Institute of Business Administration, Karachi]] and non-for-profit organizations like [[Rabtt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rabtt.org/rabtt-blue-book/ | title=Rabtt - Blue Book| publisher=Rabtt.org | accessdate=2017-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote [[theatre]] and [[literature]] in [[Pakistan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61989">'''Indian art''' consists of a variety of art forms, including plastic arts (e.g., [[pottery]], [[sculpture in the Indian subcontinent|sculpture]]), [[visual arts]] (e.g., [[Indian painting|paintings]]), performing arts and [[textile arts]] (e.g. [[Silk in the Indian subcontinent#Origin|woven silk]]). Geographically, it spans the entire [[Indian subcontinent]], including what is now [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]] and eastern [[Afghanistan]]. A strong sense of design is characteristic of Indian art and can be observed in its modern and traditional forms.

The origin of Indian art can be traced to [[Prehistoric Sweden|pre-historic]] settlements in the 3rd millennium BC. On its way to modern times, Indian art has had cultural influences, as well as religious influences such as [[Hindu art|Hinduism]], [[Buddhist art|Buddhism]], [[Jain art|Jainism]], [[Sikh art and culture|Sikhism]] and [[Islam in India#Indo-Islamic art and architecture|Islam]]. In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups.

In historic art, sculpture in stone and metal, mainly religious, has survived the Indian climate better than other media and provides most of the best remains. Many of the most important ancient finds that are not in carved stone come from the surrounding, drier regions rather than India itself. [[Indian funeral]] and philosophic traditions exclude [[grave goods]], which is the main source of ancient art in other cultures.

Rock art of India includes [[rock relief]] carvings, engravings and paintings. It is estimated there are about 1300 rock art sites with over a quarter of a million figures and figurines.&lt;ref name="Gupta1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jagadish Gupta|title=Pre-historic Indian Painting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H8zpAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=North Central Zone Cultural Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest rock carvings in India were discovered by [[A.C.L. Carlleyle|Archibald Carlleyle]], twelve years before the [[Cave of Altamira]] in Spain,&lt;ref name="Tiwari2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shiv Kumar Tiwari|title=Riddles of Indian Rockshelter Paintings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-jO0fvT4r9gC&amp;pg=PA8|date=1 January 2000|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|isbn=978-81-7625-086-3|pages=8–}}&lt;/ref&gt; although his work only came to light much later via J Cockburn (1899).&lt;ref name="cockburn1899"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cockburn|first1=John|title=Art. V.—Cave Drawings in the Kaimūr Range, North-West Provinces.|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain &amp; Ireland |series=New Series|date=1899|volume=31|issue=1|pages=89–97|doi=10.1017/S0035869X00026113|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0035869X00026113|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[V. S. Wakankar|Dr. V. S. Wakankar]] discovered several painted rock shelters in Central India, situated around the [[Vindhya Range|Vindhya mountain range]]. Of these, the [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]] have been deemed a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/925|title = Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka|date = 2003|accessdate = 12 November 2014|website = UNESCO World Heritage Convention|publisher = UNESCO|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings in these sites commonly depicted scenes of human life alongside animals, and hunts with stone implements. Their style varied with region and age, but the most common characteristic was a red wash made using a powdered mineral called ''geru'', which is a form of Iron Oxide ([[Hematite]]).&lt;ref name=pathak&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pathak|first1=Dr. Meenakshi Dubey|title=Indian Rock Art - Prehistoric Paintings of the Pachmarhi Hills|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/india/pachmarhi/index.php|publisher=Bradshaw Foundation|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indus Valley Civilization ({{circa|lk=no|5000 BCE|1500 BCE}})===
{{main|Indus Valley Civilization}}
Despite its widespread and sophistication, the Indus Valley civilization seems to have taken no interest in public large-scale art, unlike many other early civilizations. A number of gold, [[terracotta]] and stone figurines of girls in dancing poses reveal the presence of some forms of [[dance]]. Additionally, the terracotta figurines included cows, bears, monkeys, and dogs. The animal depicted on a majority of seals at sites of the mature period has not been clearly identified. Part bull, part zebra, with a majestic horn, it has been a source of speculation. As yet, there is insufficient evidence to substantiate claims that the image had religious or cultist significance, but the prevalence of the image raises the question of whether or not the animals in images of the IVC are religious symbols.&lt;ref name=" Keay, John 2000"&gt;Keay, John, India, a History.  New York: Grove Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous piece is the bronze ''Dancing Girl'' of [[Mohenjo-Daro]], which shows remarkably advanced modelling of the human figure for this early date.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 15-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Seals have been found at Mohenjo-Daro depicting a figure standing on its head, and another sitting cross-legged in what some call a [[yoga]]-like pose. This figure, sometimes known as a ''Pashupati'', has been variously identified. Sir John Marshall identified a resemblance to the Hindu god, Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Sir John. Mohenjo-Daro and the Indus Civilisation, 3 vols, London: Arthur Probsthain, 1931&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the Indus Valley Civilization, there is a surprising absence of art of any great degree of sophistication until the Buddhist era.  It is thought that this partly reflects the use of perishable organic materials such as wood.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mauryan art ({{circa|lk=no|322 BCE|185 BCE}})===
{{main|Mauryan art}}

[[File:Ashoka pillar at Vaishali, Bihar, India 2007-01-29.jpg|thumb|right|200 PX|Single Lion capital at [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]].]]
The north Indian [[Maurya Empire]] flourished from 322 BCE to 185 BCE, and at its maximum extent controlled all of the sub-continent except the extreme south as well as influences from [[Ancient Persia|Indian ancient traditions, and Ancient Persia]],&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 22-28&lt;/ref&gt; as shown by the [[Pataliputra capital]].

The emperor [[Ashoka]], who died in 232 BCE, adopted [[Buddhism]] about half-way through his 40-year reign, and patronized several large [[stupa]]s at key sites from the life of the [[Buddha]], although very little decoration from the Mauryan period survives, and there may not have been much in the first place.  There is more from various early sites of [[Indian rock-cut architecture]]. The most famous survivals are the large animals surmounting several of the [[Pillars of Ashoka]], which showed a confident and boldly mature style and craft and first of its kind iron casting without rust until date, which was in use by vedic people in rural areas of the country, though we have very few remains showing its development.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 22-26&lt;/ref&gt; The famous detached [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]], with four animals, was adopted as the official [[Emblem of India]] after [[Partition of India|Indian independence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india.gov.in/knowindia/national_symbols.php?id=9 State Emblem] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511134823/http://www.india.gov.in/knowindia/national_symbols.php?id=9 |date=May 11, 2012 }}, Know India india.gov.in&lt;/ref&gt; Many small popular [[terracotta]] figurines are recovered in archaeology, in a range of often vigorous if somewhat crude styles.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 39-42&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Greco-Buddhist art|Mathura art}}
[[File:Karla caves Chaitya.jpg|thumb|A monumental rock-cut cave, the Great Chaitya at [[Karla caves]], built circa 120 CE.]]
The major survivals of Buddhist art begin in the period after the Mauryans, from which good quantities of sculpture survives after many Hindu, buddhist and jain temples destroyed by mughal rulers time to time. some key sites such as [[Sanchi]], [[Bharhut]] and [[Amaravati Marbles|Amaravati]], some of which remain ''in situ'', with others in museums in India or around the world. Stupas were surrounded by ceremonial fences with four profusely carved [[torana]]s or ornamental gateways facing the cardinal directions. These are in stone, though clearly adopting forms developed in wood. They and the walls of the stupa itself can be heavily decorated with reliefs, mostly illustrating the lives of the Buddha. Gradually life-size figures were sculpted, initially in deep relief, but then free-standing.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 105-117, 26-47&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Mathura]] was the most important centre in this development, which applied to Hindu and Jain art as well as Buddhist.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 59-70&lt;/ref&gt;  The facades and interiors of rock-cut ''[[chaitya]]'' prayer halls and monastic ''[[vihara]]s'' have survived better than similar free-standing structures elsewhere, which were for long mostly in wood. The caves at [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], [[Karla Caves|Karle]], [[Bhaja Caves|Bhaja]] and elsewhere contain early sculpture, often outnumbered by later works such as iconic figures of the Buddha and [[bodhisattva]]s, which are not found before 100 CE at the least.

Buddhism developed an increasing emphasis on statues of the Buddha, which was greatly influenced by Hindu and Jain religious figurative art, The figures of this period which were also influenced by the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of the centuries after the defeat of [[Alexander the Great]].  This fusion developed in the far north-west of India, especially [[Gandhara]] in modern [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 105-117, 71-84 on Gandhara&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian [[Kushan Empire]] spread from [[Central Asia]] to include northern India in the early centuries CE, and briefly commissioned large statues that were portraits of the royal dynasty, [[Mughal miniature]].&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 68-70 (but see p. 253 for another exception)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shunga Dynasty (c. 185 BCE - 72 BCE) ====
''Main article:'' [[Shunga Empire]]

With the fall of the [[Maurya Empire]], control of India was returned to the older custom of regional dynasties, one of the most significant of which was the Shunga Dynasty (c. 185 BCE - 72 BCE) of central India. During this period, as well as during the Satavahana Dynasty which occurred concurrently with the Shunga Dynasty in south India, some of the most significant early Buddhist architecture was created. Arguably, the most significant architecture of this dynasty is the stupa, a religious monument which usually holds a sacred relic of Buddhism. These relics were often, but not always, in some way directly connected to the Buddha. Due to the fact that these stupas contained remains of the Buddha himself, each stupa was venerated as being an extension of the Buddha's body, his enlightenment, and of his achievement of nirvana. The way in which Buddhists venerate the stupa is by walking around it in a clockwise manner.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art History|last=Stokstad|first=Marilyn|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2018|isbn=9780134475882|location=United States|pages=306 - 310}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
[[File:The great stupa.jpg|thumb|The Great Stupa at Sanchi, c. 273 BCE - 232 BCE (Mauryan Empire), enlarged c. 150 BCE - 50 BCE (Shunga Dynasty)]]
One of the most notable examples of the [[Stupa|Buddhist stupa]] from the Shunga Dynasty is The Great Stupa at Sanchi, which was thought to be founded by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka c. 273 BCE - 232 BCE during the Maurya Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/shun/hd_shun.htm|title=Shunga Dynasty (ca.

====[[Satavahana dynasty]] (c. 1st/3rd century BCE  – c. 3rd century CE) ====

Satavahana dynasty was originally under the rule in central India, and after 1st century CE, in the south region. During Satavahana dynasty, a great number of significant Buddhist artworks were produced during this period. [[Stupa|Stupas]] and temples are the most typical Buddhist architectures in this period. Stupas are religious monuments built on burial mounds, which contain relics beneath a solid dome. Stupas in different areas of India may vary in structure, size, and design; however, their representational meanings are quite similar. They are designed based on [[mandala]], a graph of cosmos specific to Buddhism. A traditional stupa has a railing that provides a sacred path for Buddhist followers to practice devotional [[circumambulation]] in ritual settings. Also, ancient Indians considered caves as sacred places since they were habitants of holy men and monks. The Chaitya was constructed from a cave. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art History|last=|first=|publisher=Pearson|year=|isbn=9780134475882|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officially established by [[Kujula Kadphises]], the first Kushan emperor who united the [[Yuezhi]] tribes, Kushan empire was a syncretic empire in central Asia. In this period, Kushan art inherited the [[Greco-Buddhist art]], and the depictions of Buddha himself first appeared in art. Wearing a monk’s robe and a long length of cloth draped over the left shoulder and around the body, the Buddha was depicted with 32 major [[Lakshana|lakshanas]] (distinguishing marks), including a golden-colored body, an [[ushnisha]] (a protuberance) on the top of his head, heavy earrings, elongated earlobes, long arms, the impression of a [[chakra]] (wheel) on the palms of his hands and the soles of his feet, and the [[urna]] (a mark between his eyebrows)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.   

===Gupta art ({{circa|lk=no|320 CE|550 CE}})===
{{main|Gupta_Empire#Art}}
The Gupta period is generally regarded as a classic peak of north Indian art for all the major religious groups. Although painting was evidently widespread, the surviving works are almost all religious sculpture. The period saw the emergence of the iconic carved stone deity in Hindu art, as well as the Buddha-figure and [[Jain]] ''[[tirthankara]]'' figures, these last often on a very large scale.  The two great centers of sculpture were [[Mathura]] and [[Gandhara]], the latter the center of [[Greco-Buddhist art]].

Although the Gupta period marked the "golden age" of classical Hinduism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hinduism: Past and Present|last = Michaels|first = Axel|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0-691-08953-9|location = |pages = 40|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PD-flQMc1ocC&amp;pg=PR4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the early architectural style of Hindu temples were sophisticated and scientific in nature, consisting large courtyards, garbh grah, siting area, prayer area a large complex and well planned architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 1062933|title = A Fitting Approach to God: On Entering the Western Temples at Khajurāho|last = Alles|first = Gregory D.|date = November 1993|journal = History of Religions|doi = 10.1086/463362|pmid = |volume = 33|issue = 2|pages = 161–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in stark contrast to the complex plans with multiple ''shikaras'' (towers) and ''mandapas'' (halls) of various utility as stated in veda outlining building of temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://www.academia.edu/2408684|title = The Representation of Women in the Erotic Sculptures of Khajuraho|date = 29 December 2012|accessdate = 8 November 2014|website = academia.edu|publisher = School of Arts and Aesthetics, Jawaharlal Nehru University|last = Saini|first = Shilpi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Modern and Colonial Era ({{circa|lk=no|1400 CE|1800 CE}}){{Anchor|EarlyModernAndColonialEra}}==

=== Mughal art ===
{{Main|Mughal painting}}
Although [[Islam in India|Islamic footholds in India]] were made as early as the first half of the 10th century, it wasn't until the [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal Empire]] that one observes emperors with a patronage for the fine arts. [[Humayun|Emperor Humayun]], during his reestablishment of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] in 1555, brought with him [[Mir Sayyid Ali]] and [[Abd al-Samad]], two of the finest painters from [[Tahmasp I|Persian Shah Tahmasp]]'s renowned atelier.

During the reign of [[Akbar]] (1556—1605), the number of painters grew from around 30 during the creation of the ''[[Hamzanama]]'' in the mid-1560s, to around 130 by the mid 1590s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Journal|title = Scribal Notes on Mughal Manuscript Illustrations|last = Seyller|first = John|date = 1987|journal = Artibus Asiae|doi = |pmid = |volume = 48|issue = 3/4|pages = 247–277|jstor = 3249873}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to court historian [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu'l-Fazal]], Akbar was hands-on in his interest of the arts, inspecting his painters regularly and rewarding the best.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ain-i Akbari|last = Fazl|first = Abu'l|publisher = Asiatic Society of Bengal|year = 1927|isbn = |location = |pages = |others = Translated by H Blochmann.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is during this time that Persian artists were attracted to bringing their unique style to the empire. Indian elements were present in their works from the beginning, with the incorporation of local Indian flora and fauna that were otherwise absent from the traditional Persian style. The paintings of this time reflected the vibrancy and inclusion of Akbar's kingdom, with production of [[Persian miniature]]s, the [[Rajput painting]]s (including the [[Kangra painting|Kangra school]]) and the [[Pahari painting|Pahari style]] of Northern India. They also influenced the [[Company style]] watercolor paintings created during the British rule many years later.{{Gallery

With the death of Akbar, his son [[Jahangir]] (1605–1627) took the throne. He preferred each painter work on a single piece rather than the collaboration fostered during Akbar's time. This period marks the emergence of distinct individual styles, notably [[Bishandas|Bishan Das]], [[Manohar Das]], [[Abu al-Hasan (Mughal painter)|Abu al-Hasan]], [[Govardhan (Mughal painter)|Govardhan]], and Daulat.&lt;ref name="daulat"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Daulat |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/152389/Daulat |accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Razmnama]]'' (Persian translation of the Hindu epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'') and an illustrated memoir of Jahangir, named ''Tuzuk-i Jahangiri'', were created under his rule. Jahangir was succeeded by [[Shah Jahan]] (1628–1658), whose most notable architectural contribution is the [[Taj Mahal]]. Paintings under his rule were more formal, featuring court scenes, in contrast to the personal styles from his predecessor's time. [[Aurangzeb]] (1658–1707), who held increasingly orthodox Sunni beliefs, forcibly took the throne from his father Shah Jahan. With a ban of music and painting in 1680, his reign saw the decline of Mughal patronage of the arts.

=== Other medieval Indian Kingdoms ===
[[Mughal painting|Mughal art]] influenced the [[Rajput painting|Rajput]], [[Pahari painting|Pahari]], [[Deccan painting|Deccan]], [[Kangra painting|Kangra]] and various other local styles of art. 

In South-Central India, during the late fifteenth century after the Middle kingdoms, the [[Bahmani sultanate]] disintegrated into the [[Deccan sultanates]] centered at [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]], [[Golconda Sultanate|Golconda]], [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate|Ahmadnagar]], [[Barid Shahi Dynasty|Bidar]], and [[Berar Sultanate|Berar]]. They used vedic techniques of metal casting, stone carving, and painting, as well as a distinctive architectural style with the addition of citadels and tombs from Mughal architecture. For instance, the Baridi dynasty (1504–1619) of Bidar saw the invention of [[Bidriware|''bidri'' ware]], which was adopted from Vedic and Maurya period ashoka pillars of zinc mixed with copper, tin, and lead and inlaid with silver or brass, then covered with a mud paste containing sal ammoniac, which turned the base metal black, highlighting the color and sheen of the inlaid metal. Only after the Mughal conquest of Ahmadnagar in 1600 did the Persian influence patronized by the Turco-Mongol Mughals begin to affect Deccan art.

===British period (1841–1947)===

British colonial rule had a great impact on Indian art. Old patrons of art became less wealthy and influential, and Western art more ubiquitous as the British Empire established schools of art in major cities, e.g. the [[Bombay Art Society]] in 1888. The [[Company style]] of paintings became common, created by Indian artists working for European patrons of the [[East India Company]]. The style was mainly [[Romanticism|Romanticized]], with watercolor the primary medium used to convey soft textures and tones.&lt;ref name="MichellLampert1982"&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Michell|author2=Catherine Lampert|author3=Tristram Holland|title=In the Image of Man: The Indian Perception of the Universe Through 2000 Years of Painting and Sculpture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=evtIAQAAIAAJ|year=1982|publisher=Alpine Fine Arts Collection|isbn=978-0-933516-52-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By [[Government of India Act 1858|1858]], the British government took over the task of administration of India under the [[British Raj]].

With the [[Swadeshi Movement]] gaining momentum by 1905, Indian artists attempted to resuscitate the cultural identities suppressed by the British, rejecting the Romanticized style of the Company paintings and the mannered work of Raja Ravi Varma and his followers. Thus was created what is known today as the [[Bengal School of Art]], led by the reworked Asian styles (with an emphasis on Indian nationalism) of [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871—1951), who has been referred to as the father of Modern Indian art.&lt;ref name="India2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hachette India|title=Indiapedia: The All-India Factfinder|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCEYAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT130|date=25 October 2013|publisher=Hachette India|isbn=978-93-5009-766-3|pages=130–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists of the Tagore family, such as [[Rabindranath Tagore]] (1861–1941) and [[Gaganendranath Tagore]] (1867–1938) as well as new artists of the early 20th century such as [[Amrita Sher-Gil]] (1913–1941) were responsible for introducing [[Avant-garde]] western styles into Indian Art. Many other artists like [[Jamini Roy]] and later [[S.H. Raza]] took inspiration from [[folk traditions]]. In 1944, [[K.C.S. Paniker]] founded the Progressive Painters' Association (PPA) thus giving rise to the "madras movement" in art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=For art's sake  |url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2009/02/12/stories/2009021251330400.htm |date= February 12, 2009|publisher= [[The Hindu]]|page=|accessdate=Nov 23, 2014|newspaper=The Hindu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, India became independent of British rule. A group of six artists - [[K. H. Ara]], [[S. K. Bakre]], [[H. A. Gade]], [[M.F. Husain]], [[S.H. Raza]] and [[Francis Newton Souza]] - founded the [[Progressive Artists' Group|Bombay Progressive Artists' Group]] in the year 1952, to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. Though the group was dissolved in 1956, it was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art. Almost all India's major artists in the 1950s were associated with the group. Some of those who are well-known today are Bal Chabda, [[Manishi Dey]], V. S. Gaitonde, [[Krishen Khanna]], [[Ram Kumar (artist)|Ram Kumar]], [[Tyeb Mehta]], [[K. G. Subramanyan]], [[A.

Among the best-known artists of the newer generation include [[Bose Krishnamachari]] and [[Bikash Bhattacharya]]. Another prominent Pakistani modernist was [[Ismail Gulgee]], who after about 1960 adopted an abstract idiom that combines aspects of [[Islamic calligraphy]] with an [[abstract expressionist]] (or [[gestural abstraction]]ist) sensibility.

Painting and sculpture remained important in the later half of the twentieth century, though in the work of leading artists such as [[Nalini Malani]], [[Subodh Gupta]], [[Narayanan Ramachandran]], [[Vivan Sundaram]], [[Jitish Kallat]], they often found radical new directions. Bharti Dayal has chosen to handle the traditional Mithila painting in most contemporary way and created her own style through the exercises of her own imagination, they appear fresh and unusual.

The increase in discourse about Indian art, in English as well as vernacular Indian languages, changed the way art was perceived in the art schools. Critical approach became rigorous; critics like [[Geeta Kapur]], [[R. Siva Kumar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ngmaindia.gov.in/benodebehari_late.asp | title=National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://asiasociety.org/arts/asia-society-museum/past-exhibitions/rabindranath-tagore-last-harvest | title=Rabindranath Tagore: The Last Harvest}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Shivaji K.

{{main|Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism}}

The year 1997 bore witness to two parallel gestures of canon formation. On the one hand, the influential Baroda Group, a coalition whose original members included [[Vivan Sundaram]], [[Ghulam Mohammed Sheikh]], [[Bhupen Khakhar]], and [[Nalini Malani]]—and which had left its mark on history in the form of the 1981 exhibition “Place for People”—was definitively historicized in 1997 with the publication of Contemporary Art in Baroda, an anthology of essays edited by Sheikh. On the other hand, the art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]]'s benchmark exhibition and related publication, A [[Contextual Modernism]], restored the [[Santiniketan]] artists—[[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]], and [[Ramkinkar Baij]]—to their proper place as the originators of an indigenously achieved yet transcultural modernism in the 1930s, well before the Progressives composed their manifesto in the late 1940s. Of the Santiniketan artists, Siva Kumar observed that they “reviewed traditional antecedents in relation to the new avenues opened up by cross-cultural contacts. They also saw it as a historical imperative. Cultural insularity, they realized, had to give way to eclecticism and cultural impurity.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/publications/AbbyGreyAndIndianModernism_GreyNYU_20150116.pdf | title=Home}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Professor R. Siva Kumar.jpg|thumb|art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]]]]
The idea of [[Contextual Modernism]] emerged in 1997 from [[R. Siva Kumar]]'s [[Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism]] as a [[postcolonial]] critical tool in the understanding of an alternative [[modernism]] in the visual arts of the erstwhile colonies like India, specifically that of the Santiniketan artists.

Several terms including [[Paul Gilroy]]'s ''counter culture of modernity'' and [[Tani Barlow]]'s ''Colonial modernity'' have been used to describe the kind of alternative modernity that emerged in non-European contexts. Professor Gall argues that 'Contextual Modernism' is a more suited term because “the colonial in ''colonial modernity'' does not accommodate the refusal of many in colonized situations to internalize inferiority. Santiniketan's artist teachers' refusal of subordination incorporated a counter vision of modernity, which sought to correct the racial and cultural essentialism that drove and characterized imperial Western modernity and modernism. Those European modernities, projected through a triumphant British colonial power, provoked nationalist responses, equally problematic when they incorporated similar essentialisms.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huichawaii.org/assets/gall,-david---overcoming-polarized-modernities.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[R. Siva Kumar]] "The Santiniketan artists were one of the first who consciously challenged this idea of modernism by opting out of both internationalist modernism and historicist indigenousness and tried to create a context sensitive modernism."&lt;ref name="humanitiesunderground.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/ | title=Humanities underground » All the Shared Experiences of the Lived World II}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and thinking about their approach to art since the early 80s. The practice of subsuming [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] under the [[Bengal School of Art]] was, according to Siva Kumar, misleading. ''This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice''.&lt;ref name="humanitiesunderground.org"/&gt;

''Contextual Modernism'' in the recent past has found its usage in other related fields of studies, specially in [[Architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:444711 | title="Contextual modernism" – is it possible?

==Material history of Indian art==
===Sculpture===
{{main|sculpture in the Indian subcontinent}}
[[File:Nataraja01.jpg|right|thumb|[[Chola art|Chola bronze]] statue of ''Nataraja'' at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York City]]
The first known sculpture in the Indian subcontinent is from the [[Indus Valley civilization]] (3300–1700 BC), found in sites at [[Mohenjo-daro]] and [[Harappa]] in modern-day [[Pakistan]]. These include the famous small bronze male dancer. However such figures in bronze and stone are rare and greatly outnumbered by pottery figurines and stone seals, often of animals or deities very finely depicted.  After the collapse of the Indus Valley civilization there is little record of sculpture until the Buddhist era, apart from a hoard of copper figures of (somewhat controversially) c. 1500 BCE from [[Daimabad]].&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 17–20&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the great tradition of Indian monumental sculpture in stone appears to begin relatively late, with the reign of [[Ashoka]] from 270 to 232 BCE, and the [[Pillars of Ashoka]] he erected around India, carrying his edicts and topped by famous sculptures of animals, mostly lions, of which six survive.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 22–24&lt;/ref&gt;  Large amounts of figurative sculpture, mostly in relief, survive from Early Buddhist pilgrimage stupas, above all [[Sanchi]]; these probably developed out of a tradition using wood.&lt;ref name="Harle, 26–38"&gt;Harle, 26–38&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, wood continued to be the main sculptural and architectural medium in [[Kerala]] throughout all historic periods until recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 342-350&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2nd to 1st century BCE in far northern [[India]], in the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]] from what is now southern [[Afghanistan]] and northern [[Pakistan]], sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha's life and teachings. Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form before this time, but only through some of his symbols. This may be because [[Gandhara]]n Buddhist sculpture in modern Afghanistan displays [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Persia]]n artistic influence. Artistically, the Gandharan school of sculpture is said to have contributed wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, acanthus leaf decorations, etc.

The pink sandstone Hindu, [[Jain]] and Buddhist sculptures of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] from the 1st to 3rd centuries CE reflected both native Indian traditions and the Western influences received through the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, and effectively established the basis for subsequent Indian religious sculpture.&lt;ref name="Harle, 26–38"/&gt; The style was developed and diffused through most of India under the [[Gupta Empire]] (c. 320-550) which remains a "classical" period for Indian sculpture, covering the earlier [[Ellora Caves]],&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 87; his Part 2 covers the period&lt;/ref&gt; though the [[Elephanta Caves]] are probably slightly later.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 124&lt;/ref&gt;  Later large scale sculpture remains almost exclusively religious, and generally rather conservative, often reverting to simple frontal standing poses for deities, though the attendant spirits such as apsaras and [[yakshi]] often have sensuously curving poses.  Carving is often highly detailed, with an intricate backing behind the main figure in high relief.  The celebrated [[Lost-wax casting|lost wax]] bronzes of the [[Chola]] dynasty (c. 850–1250) from [[south India]], many designed to be carried in processions, include the iconic form of [[Shiva]] as [[Nataraja]],&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 301-310, 325-327&lt;/ref&gt; with the massive granite carvings of [[Mahabalipuram]] dating from the previous [[Pallava]] dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 276–284&lt;/ref&gt;
The Chola period is also remarkable for its sculptures and bronzes.&lt;ref&gt;Chopra. ''et al.'', p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the existing specimens in the various [[museums]] of the world and in the temples of South India may be seen many fine figures of Siva in various forms, [[Vishnu]] and his wife [[Lakshmi]], Siva saints and many more.&lt;ref name="tri479"&gt;Tri. ''[Title needed]''. p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wall painting===
[[File:Ajanta Padmapani.jpg|thumb|Fresco from the [[Ajanta Caves]], c. 450-500]]
{{details|Cave paintings in India}}

The tradition and methods of Indian cliff painting gradually evolved throughout many thousands of years - there are multiple locations found with prehistoric art. The early caves included overhanging rock decorated with [[Petroglyph|rock-cut art]] and the use of natural caves during the [[Mesolithic]] period (6000 BCE). Their use has continued in some areas into historic times.&lt;ref name="art"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/india/bhi1.html
|title= Prehistoric Rock Art
|publisher=art-and-archaeology.com
|accessdate = 2006-10-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]] are on the edge of the [[Deccan Plateau]] where deep erosion has left huge [[sandstone]] outcrops. The many caves and [[grotto]]s found there contain primitive [[tool]]s and decorative rock paintings that reflect the ancient tradition of human interaction with their landscape, an interaction that continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2006-12-20
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest surviving frescoes of the historical period have been preserved in the [[Ajanta Caves]] with Cave 10 having some from the 1st century CE, though the larger and more famous groups are from the 5th century. Despite climatic conditions that tend to work against the survival of older paintings, in total there are known more than 20 locations in India with paintings and traces of former paintings of ancient and early medieval times (up to the 8th to 10th centuries CE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Best/As/IndMedCavePaint.htm |title=Ancient and medieval Indian cave paintings - Internet encyclopedia |accessdate=2010-06-04 |date=2010-06-10 |work=Wondermondo }}&lt;/ref&gt; although these are just a tiny fraction of what would have once existed. The most significant frescoes of the ancient and early medieval period are found in the Ajanta, [[Bagh Caves|Bagh]], [[Ellora]], and [[Sittanavasal Cave|Sittanavasal]] caves, the last being [[Jain]] of the 7th-10th centuries. Although many show evidence of being by artists mainly used to decorating palaces, no early secular wall-paintings survive.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 355&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1561-Akbar riding the elephant Hawa'I pursuing another elephant across a collapsing bridge of boats (right).jpg|right|thumb|[[Akbar]] riding the elephant Hawa'I pursuing another elephant]]

The [[Chola]] fresco paintings were discovered in 1931 within the circumambulatory passage of the [[Brihadisvara Temple]] at [[Thanjavur]], [[Tamil Nadu]], and are the first Chola specimens discovered. Researchers have discovered the technique used in these frescoes. A smooth batter of limestone mixture is applied over the stones, which took two to three days to set. Within that short span, such large paintings were painted with natural organic pigments. During the [[Thanjavur Nayak|Nayak]] period the Chola paintings were painted over. The Chola frescoes lying underneath have an ardent spirit of [[saivism]] is expressed in them. They probably synchronised with the completion of the temple by Rajaraja Cholan the Great.

[[Kerala mural painting]] has well-preserved [[fresco]] or [[mural]] or [[wall painting]] in temple walls in Pundarikapuram, [[Ettumanoor]] and [[Aymanam]] and elsewhere.

===Miniature painting===
Although few Indian miniatures survive from before about 1000 CE, and some from the next few centuries, there was probably a considerable tradition. Those that survive are initially illustrations for Buddhist texts, later followed by Jain and Hindu equivalents, and the decline of Buddhist as well as the vulnerable support material of the [[palm-leaf manuscript]] probably explain the rarity of early examples.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 361-366&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mughal painting]] in miniatures on paper developed very quickly in the late 16th century from the combined influence of the existing miniature tradition and artists trained in the [[Persian miniature]] tradition imported by the [[Mughal Emperor]]'s court.  New ingredients in the style were much greater realism, especially in portraits, and an interest in animals, plants and other aspects of the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 372-382&lt;/ref&gt;

Miniatures either illustrated books or were single works for [[muraqqa]]s or albums of painting and [[Islamic calligraphy]].  The style gradually spread in the next two centuries to influence painting on paper in both Muslim and Hindu princely courts, developing into a number of regional styles often called "sub-Mughal", including [[Kangra painting]] and [[Rajput painting]], and finally [[Company painting]], a hybrid [[watercolour]] style influenced by European art and largely patronized by the people of the [[British raj]].  From the 19th century Western-style [[easel painting]]s became increasingly painted by Indian artists trained in Government art schools.

===Jewellery===
[[File:Andhra Pradesh Royal earrings 1st Century BCE.jpg|left|thumb|Pair of gold earrings, 1st century BCE, [[Andhra Pradesh]].]]

The [[Indian subcontinent]] has the longest continuous legacy of jewellery-making, with a history of over 5,000 years.&lt;ref name="Untracht, Oppi p15"&gt;Untracht, Oppi. ''Traditional Jewelry of India''. New York: Abrams, 1997 {{ISBN|0-8109-3886-3}}. p15.&lt;/ref&gt; Using jewellery as a [[store of value|store of capital]] remains more common in India than in most modern societies, and gold appears always to have been strongly preferred for the metal. India and the surrounding areas were important sources of high-quality [[gemstone]]s, and the jewellery of the ruling class is typified by using them lavishly. One of the first to start jewellery-making were the people of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]].  Early remains are few, as they were not buried with their owners.

===Other materials===
Wood was undoubtedly extremely important, but rarely survives long in the Indian climate. Organic animal materials such as [[ivory]] or bone were discouraged by the [[Dharmic religions]], although Buddhist examples exist, such as the [[Begram ivories]], many of Indian manufacture, but found in [[Afghanistan]], and some relatively modern [[Ivory carved tusk depicting Buddha life stories|carved tusks]]. In Muslim settings they are more common.

==Contextual history of Indian art==
===Temple art===
{{Main|Indian rock-cut architecture}}

Obscurity shrouds the period between the decline of the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappans]] and the definite historic period starting with the [[Maurya]]s, and in the historical period, the earliest Indian religion to inspire major artistic monuments was [[Buddhism]]. Though there may have been earlier structures in wood that have been transformed into stone structures, there are no physical evidences for these except textual references.  Soon after the Buddhists initiated [[Indian rock-cut architecture|rock-cut caves]], [[Hindu]]s and [[Jain]]s started to imitate them at [[Badami]], [[Aihole]], [[Ellora]], [[Salsette]], [[Elephanta Caves|Elephanta]], [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] and [[Mamallapuram]] and [[Mughals]]. It appears to be a constant in Indian art that the different religions shared a very similar artistic style at any particular period and place, though naturally adapting the [[iconography]] to match the religion commissioning them.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 59&lt;/ref&gt;  Probably the same groups of artists worked for the different religions regardless of their own affiliations.

[[File:Statuetta indiana di Lakshmi, avorio, da pompei, 1-50 dc ca., 149425, 02.JPG|thumb|Indian art also found its way into Italy, within the context of [[Indo-Roman trade]]: in 1938 the [[Pompeii Lakshmi]] was found in the ruins of [[Pompeii]] (destroyed in an eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] in 79 CE).]] 
Buddhist art first developed during the [[Gandhara]] period and [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] Periods around the 1st century BCE. It flourished greatly during the [[Gupta]] Periods and [[Pala Empire|Pala]] Periods that comprise the Golden Age of India. Although the most glorious art of these Indian empires was mostly Buddhist in nature, subsequently Hindu Empires like the [[Pallava]], [[Chola]], [[Hoysala]] and [[Vijayanagara]] Empires developed their own styles of Hindu art as well.

There is no time line that divides the creation of rock-cut temples and free-standing temples built with cut stone as they developed in parallel. The building of free-standing structures began in the 5th century, while rock-cut temples continued to be excavated until the 12th century. An example of a free-standing structural temple is the [[Shore Temple]], a part of the [[Mahabalipuram]] World Heritage Site, with its slender tower, built on the shore of the [[Bay of Bengal]] with finely carved [[granite]] rocks cut like bricks and dating from the 8th century.&lt;ref name="binda"&gt;{{cite book

===Folk and tribal art===

Folk and tribal art in India takes on different manifestations through varied media such as pottery, painting, metalwork,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiansculptor.net/index.htm dhokra art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229115852/http://indiansculptor.net/index.htm |date=2010-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; paper-art, weaving and designing of objects such as jewellery and toys. These are not just aesthetic objects but in fact have an important significance in people's lives and are tied to their beliefs and rituals. The objects can range from sculpture, masks (used in rituals and ceremonies), paintings, textiles, baskets, kitchen objects, arms and weapons, and the human body itself (tattoos and piercings). There is a deep symbolic meaning that is attached to not only the objects themselves but also the materials and techniques used to produce them.

Often [[puranic]] gods and legends are transformed into contemporary forms and familiar images. Fairs, festivals, local heroes (mostly warriors) and local deities play a vital role in these arts (Example: [[Nakashi art]] from [[Telangana]] or [[Cherial scroll painting|Cherial Scroll Painting]]).

Folk art also includes the visual expressions of the wandering nomads. This is the art of people who are exposed to changing landscapes as they travel over the valleys and highlands of India. They carry with them the experiences and memories of different spaces and their art consists of the transient and dynamic pattern of life. The [[rural]], [[tribal]] and arts of the [[nomad]]s constitute the matrix of folk expression. Examples of folk arts are Warli, [[Madhubani art|Madhubani Art]], [[Manjusha Art]], [[Tikuli art|Tikuli Art]] and Gond etc.

While most tribes and traditional folk artist communities are assimilated into the familiar kind of civilised life, they still continue to practice their art. Unfortunately though, market and economic forces have ensured that the numbers of these artists are dwindling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Gramin Vikas Seva Sanshtha |last1=GVSS |title=Evaluation Study of Tribal/Folk Arts and Culture in West Bengal, Orissa, Jharkhand, Chhatisgarh and Bihar |url=http://planningcommission.nic.in/reports/sereport/ser/ser_folk2211.pdf |website=Planning Commission |publisher=Socio-Economic Research (SER) Division, Planning Commission, Govt. of India New Delhi |date=12 June 2011 |page=53 |accessdate=2 March 2015 |quote="... globalization has triggered the emergence of a synthetic macro-culture...is gaining popularity day by day and silently engineering the gradual attrition of tribal/folk art and culture."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Decline of tribal and folk arts lamented|url=http://archive.deccanherald.com/Content/Jul32008/district2008070276661.asp|accessdate=2 March 2015|work=Deccan Herald|date=3 July 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302045047/http://archive.deccanherald.com/Content/Jul32008/district2008070276661.asp|archivedate=2 March 2015|location=Gudibanda, Karnataka, India|quote="In the wave of electronic media, our ... ancient culture and tribal art have been declining, ..., said folklore researcher J Srinivasaiah."}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lot of effort is being made by various NGOs and the Government of India to preserve and protect these arts and to promote them. Several scholars in India and across the world have studied these arts and some valuable scholarship is available on them.

The folk spirit has a tremendous role to play in the development of art and in the overall consciousness of indigenous cultures.

In female [[Human body|human anatomy]], the '''intermammary cleft''' or '''intermammary sulcus''' or '''sulcus intermammarius''' of a woman is delineated by where the fatty portions of each breast sits in relationship to the [[sternum]] (or breastbone).&lt;ref name ="  scoop"&gt;Dr. Ted Eisenberg and Joyce K. Eisenberg, ‘’ The Scoop on Breasts: A Plastic Surgeon Busts the Myths’’, Incompra Press, 2012, {{ISBN|978-0-9857249-3-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It divides the two mammary complexes that consist of two bodies of fatty pads, glandular tissues of [[mammary gland]]s, connective tissues, and skin, as well as two duct systems ([[lactiferous duct]] of [[lymphatic vessel]]) and [[lobule]] [[alveoli]] emanating from two [[nipple]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Heide Schatten and Gheorghe M.

The [[International Federation of Associations of Anatomists]] (IFAA) uses the terms "intermammary sulcus" or "intermammary cleft" when referring to the area between the breasts not including the breasts. In popular usage the area is commonly referred to as a woman's [[cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]], especially when exposed by garments with low necklines.

For legal purposes it was noted by the [[United States federal courts]] that "[[Buttock cleavage|anal cleft or cleavage]]" and "cleavage of the female breast" are so imprecise as to provide no guidance in defining them.&lt;ref&gt;West's federal supplement (First Series), p. 994, West Publishing Co, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Medically, the "width" of a woman's cleavage is determined by the attachment points of her breast tissue to the [[Periosteum|periosteal]] tissue covering her sternum and is also defined somewhat by the medial attachments of the [[pectoralis major muscle]] when implants are in the sub-muscular position.&lt;ref name=bust&gt;{{cite web|last=Oliver|first=Rob|title=I'll boost your boobs or go bust!|url=http://plasticsurgery101.blogspot.com/2007_08_01_archive.html | date=August 29, 2007 | accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plastic surgeon Alan Matarasso said, "Ergonomically speaking, cleavage equals the position of the breasts on the chest wall."&lt;ref name=divide&gt;Daphne Merkin, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/style/tmagazine/TW1792179.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0 The Great Divide]", ''New York Times'', August 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The skin of the cleavage area is frailer than the skin of the face as it has fewer oil glands, and may show loss of elasticity sooner.&lt;ref name=divide /&gt;

[[Poikiloderma of Civatte]], a condition of dilated blood vessels and red to red-brown spots, is common to the upper part of the cleavage, especially for those who wear a sports bra or push-up bra for prolonged periods, and commonly affects fair skinned middle-aged to elderly women.&lt;ref name=divide /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bolognia"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rapini, Ronald P. |author2=Bolognia, Jean L. |author3=Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is characterized by [[hypopigmentation]], hyperpigmentation, telangiectasias and superficial skin atrophy (occasional itching is reported), is another condition caused by long exposure to sunlight.&lt;ref name=murad&gt;Murad Alam and Marisa Pongprutthipan, ''Body Rejuvenation'', page 39, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2010, {{ISBN|978-1-4419-1093-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Osteopathic College of Dermatology [http://www.aocd.org/skin/dermatologic_diseases/Poikiloderma-of-Civatte.html "Dermatologic Disease Database"], ''aocd.org'', referenced July 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a non-contagious chronic [[skin disease]] which affects [[intertriginous]] skin of [[apocrine sweat gland]] bearing areas like the [[inframammary fold]] and intermammary sulcus.

[[Prurigo pigmentosa]] is a rare skin condition of unknown cause that affects depressed places on the chest and back like the intermammary area.

=== Treatment ===
[[Poikiloderma]] and [[Dermatoheliosis]] are treated by [[desquamation]] (skin peeling).&lt;ref name=divide /&gt;&lt;ref name=murad /&gt; There is no single effective treatment for HS. The recommended treatments include [[antibiotic]]s, [[antiandrogen]]s, [[corticosteroid]]s, [[ciclosporin]]s, and [[TNF inhibitor]]s.&lt;ref name=Lyons /&gt;

The '''Japan Media Arts Festival''' is an annual festival held since 1997 by [[Japan]]'s [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]]. The festival begins with an open competition and culminates with the awarding of several prizes and an exhibition.&lt;ref name="OtmazginBen-Ari2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nissim Otmazgin|author2=Eyal Ben-Ari|title=Popular Culture and the State in East and Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MsKoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93|date=March 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-62295-3|pages=93–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cipriani2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerald Cipriani|title=Culture and Dialogue Vol.3, No. 2 (2013) Issue on "Identity and Dialogue"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t50xBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|date=2 May 2014|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-5998-1|pages=8–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiner2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert G.

Based on judging by a jury of artistic peers, awards are given in four categories: Art (formerly called Non-Interactive Digital Art), Entertainment (formerly called Interactive Art; including [[video games]] and [[websites]]), [[Animation]]&lt;!--note: not anime, as foreign animated films sometimes receive awards--&gt;, and [[Manga]]. Within each category, one Grand Prize, four Excellence Prizes, and (since 2002) one Encouragement Prize are awarded.

The '''Kharraqan towers''' are [[mausoleum]]s, built in 1067 and 1093, located on the plains in northern [[Iran]], near [[Qazvin]].

The brick structures stand {{convert|15|m}} tall and {{convert|4|m}} wide, and make extensive use of geometry. Inside the older mausoleum there is a lamp and paintings{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}.

The eastern tower dates from 1067–68, while the western tower dates from 1093.&lt;ref&gt;David Stronach and T. Cuyler Young, Jr, ''Three Seljuq Tomb Towers'', '''Iran''', Vol. 4, 1966:6.&lt;/ref&gt; Both towers appear to be the work of the architect, Muhammad bin Makki al-Zanjani.&lt;ref name="DavidStronach"&gt;David Stronach and T. Cuyler Young, Jr, ''Three Seljuq Tomb Towers'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the occupant of the eastern tower was Abu Sa'id Bijar and the occupant of the western tower was Abu Mansur Iltayti.&lt;ref name="DavidStronach" /&gt;

These towers are remnant examples of architecture that existed during the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk period]] of medieval [[Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;David Stronach and T. Cuyler Young, Jr, ''Three Seljuq Tomb Towers'', 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
Both towers were significantly damaged by the [[2002 Bou'in-Zahra earthquake]]. They were in a good state of preservation before the event, suggesting it was one of the most powerful quakes in the region for approximately 900 years.&lt;ref name=geophysical&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walker |first=R.

'''La troupe du Roi de Suede''', or ''Roi de Suede'' for short, was a French-speaking Swedish [[court theater]], active at the Royal Swedish court from 1699 until 1706.

The ''Roi de Suede'' was engaged by [[Charles XII of Sweden]] because a French language court theater was regarded to be a compulsory thing in the representational life of a royal court at the time. Its leader was [[Rosidor fils]], and commonly, the company have therefore been referred to as simply "The Rosidor Troupe". The company performed both spoken drama, opera and ballet, and was regarded to have upheld a high quality. The performances were staged at the residences of the royal court, as well as in the [[Bollhuset]] in Stockholm.

The [[Great Northern War]] in 1700 caused financial difficulties for the court theater. The [[Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp|queen dowager]] would not allow the troupe to perform at court after the king had left to serve in the war. The king therefore gave permission to the ''Roi de Suede'' to perform at Bollhuset for the public in the city of Stockholm, and ordered the royal court to visit the performances there. From February 1700, they performed in public. Because of the language barrier, these were not a success among the majority of the public. They also arranged public masquerades with card gambling at Bollhuset, which evidently became popular, though also ill reputed. On at least one occasion, at Thorn in 1703, the troupe, or a part of it, traveled to perform for Charles XII during his war service.

In 1703, several of the members of the troupe left when the contract was no longer renewed because of costs. A smaller part of the troupe, however, remained, acquired a second contract in 1704, and continued the activity in Stockholm until the end term of the second contract in 1706.

In [[library science]] and architecture, a '''stack''' or '''bookstack''' (often referred to as a library building's ''stacks'') is a book storage area, as opposed to a reading area.  More specifically, this term refers to a narrow-aisled, multilevel system of iron or steel shelving that evolved in the nineteenth century to meet increasing demands for storage space.&lt;ref name="petroski"&gt;{{cite book|last=Petroski|first=Henry|title=The Book on the Book Shelf|year=1999|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|pages=167–168, 170–172, 184, 191}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An "open-stack" library allows its patrons to enter the stacks to browse for themselves; "closed stacks" means library staff retrieve books for patrons on request.

==Early development==
French architect [[Henri Labrouste]], shortly after making pioneering use of iron in the [[Bibliotheque Sainte-Genevieve]] of 1850, created a four story iron stack for the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].&lt;ref name="ELH"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wiegand|first=Wayne, ed.|title=Encyclopedia of Library History|year=1994|publisher=Garland|pages=352–355}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1857, multilevel stacks with grated iron floors were installed in the [[British Library]].&lt;ref name="petroski" /&gt;  In 1876, William R. Ware designed a stack for [[Gore Hall]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="snead 11" /&gt;  In contrast to the structural relationship found in most buildings, the floors of these bookstacks did not support the shelving, but rather the reverse, the floors being attached to, and supported by, the shelving framework.  Even the load of the building's roof, and of any non-shelving spaces above the stacks (such as offices), may be transmitted to the building's foundation through the shelving system itself. The building's external walls act as an envelope but provide no significant structural support.&lt;ref name="ELH" /&gt;

==Library of Congress and the Snead system==
For the [[Thomas Jefferson Building]] of the [[Library of Congress]], completed in 1897, [[Bernard Richardson Green]] made a number of alterations to the Gore Hall design, including the use of all-metal shelving. The contract was won by the Snead and Company Ironworks, which went on to install its standardized design in libraries around the country.&lt;ref name="snead 11" /&gt; Notable examples include the [[Widener Library]] at Harvard and the seven level stack supporting the Rose Reading Room of the New York Public Library.&lt;ref name="petroski" /&gt;

The Library of Congress bookstacks were designed and patented by Bernard R. Green (1843-1914), the engineer in charge of the Library of Congress construction, where this type of book storage was first used. Although the structure was of cast iron, the shelves were made from strips of thin U section steel, designed to be as light as an equivalent pine shelf. The top surface of the U section was ground, polished and 'lacquered' (the constituents of the lacquer are not known). Green designed the stacks to be modular, able to be erected several stories high as a single freestanding structural entity incorporating staircases and floors, and even capable of supporting a roof structure. He designed the shelves so that they could adjust to book sizes using a simple lug system without the need for any bolts or fixings. Although the bookstacks were decorated and very simply embellished, they are of machine-age industrial design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.salvoweb.com/salvonews/item-snead-cast-iron-bookstack-features-at-hindmans-chicago-sale_23258 |title=Snead cast iron bookstack features at Hindman's Chicago sale |website=salvoweb.com |date= |accessdate=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stacks were typically envisioned for access by library staff fetching books for patrons waiting elsewhere, and so were often built in ways making them unsuitable for public access.  Increasing concern with opening stacks to the public,&lt;ref name="ELH" /&gt; the desire to construct buildings adaptable to changing uses,&lt;ref name="petroski" /&gt; and concerns over the feasibility of storing truly comprehensive collections of books contributed to the decline of the Snead stack. [[Angus Snead Macdonald]], president of the Snead Company from 1915 to 1952, himself advocated for the transition to modular, open plan libraries in the mid twentieth century.&lt;ref name="ELH" /&gt;

==Forms==
For closed stacks, [[mobile shelving]] may be used to minimize floor space.  With computerized indexing, filing by book size saves up to 40% space as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Quito|first1=Anne|title=The New York Public Library has adopted a very unusual sorting system|url=http://qz.com/802744/the-legendary-new-york-public-library-shelves-books-in-its-underground-stacks-by-size-not-subject/|accessdate=13 October 2016|work=[[Quartz (publication)]]|publisher=[[Atlantic Media]]|date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Medici Madonna''''' is an [[panel painting|oil-on-panel]] painting by the [[early Netherlandish painting|Netherlandish]] artist [[Rogier van der Weyden]], dating from around 1460–1464 and housed in the [[Städel]], [[Frankfurt]], Germany.

The work is known to have been commissioned by the [[Medici]] family in [[Florence]], as testified by the Florentine coat of arms with a red lily at the center of the lower step. The work has been variously dated from 1450–1451, when the artist travelled to Rome visiting several Italian courts, or from 1460–1464, the same years of the ''[[Lamentation of Christ (Rogier van der Weyden)|Lamentation of Christ]]'', inspired by [[Beato Angelico]] and now at the [[Uffizi]].

==Description==
Above a gold background, van der Weyden painted a baldachin lined with precious [[damask]] cloth, under which are the [[Virgin with Child]], St. Peter, St. John the Baptist (patron saint of Florence), St. Cosmas (a protector of the House of Medici), and St. Damian.  [[Saints Cosmas and Damian|Cosmas]] is portrayed while putting a coin in a handbag hanging from his belt, a reference of his legend, according to which he had accepted a small sum for  a medical performance, causing rage in his brother Damian.

In the foreground is a still life with the artist's typical attention to natural details. In the centre is a gilt metallic [[amphora]], in which are several lilies: the white ones symbolize the Virgin's purity, while the red ones are another reference to Florence.

{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}}
'''Neoclassical architecture''' is an [[architectural style]] produced by the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical movement]] that began in the mid-18th century. In its purest form, it is a style principally derived from the architecture of [[classical antiquity]], the [[Vitruvius|Vitruvian]] principles, and the work of the [[Italians|Italian]] architect [[Andrea Palladio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/Neoclassical-architecture|title=Neoclassical architecture|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In form, neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than [[chiaroscuro]] and maintains separate identities to each of its parts. The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the [[Rococo]] style of naturalistic ornament, and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the [[Baroque architecture|Late Baroque]] architectural tradition. Neoclassical architecture is still designed today, but may be labelled [[New Classical Architecture]] for contemporary buildings.

In Central and Eastern Europe, the style is usually referred to as ''Classicism'' ({{lang-de|Klassizismus}}), while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical.

==History==
Intellectually, neoclassicism was symptomatic of a desire to return to the perceived "purity" of the arts of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], to the more vague perception ("ideal") of [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] arts and, to a lesser extent, 16th-century [[Renaissance Classicism]], which was also a source for academic Late Baroque architecture.

Many early 19th-century neoclassical architects were influenced by the drawings and projects of [[Étienne-Louis Boullée]] and [[Claude Nicolas Ledoux]]. The many graphite drawings of Boullée and his students depict spare geometrical architecture that emulates the eternality of the universe. There are links between Boullée's ideas and [[Edmund Burke]]'s conception of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. Ledoux addressed the concept of architectural character, maintaining that a building should immediately communicate its function to the viewer: taken literally such ideas give rise to "[[architecture parlante]]".

===Palladianism===
{{main article|Palladian architecture}}
[[File:Stourhead 2.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Palladian revival: [[Stourhead|Stourhead House]], designed by [[Colen Campbell]] and completed in 1720.  The design is based on Palladio's [[Villa Emo|Vill]]

[[Villa Emo|a Emo]].]]
A return to more classical architectural forms as a reaction to the [[Rococo]] style can be detected in some European [[architecture]] of the earlier 18th century, most vividly represented in the [[Palladian architecture]] of Georgian [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] and Ireland.

The [[baroque]] style had never truly been to the English taste. Four influential books were published in the first quarter of the 18th century which highlighted the simplicity and purity of classical architecture: ''[[Vitruvius Britannicus]]'' ([[Colen Campbell]] 1715), ''Palladio's Four Books of Architecture'' (1715), ''[[De Re Aedificatoria]]'' (1726) and ''The Designs of Inigo Jones... with Some Additional Designs'' (1727). The most popular was the four-volume ''Vitruvius Britannicus'' by Colen Campbell. The book contained architectural prints of famous British buildings that had been inspired by the great architects from [[Vitruvius]] to Palladio. At first the book mainly featured the work of [[Inigo Jones]], but the later tomes contained drawings and plans by Campbell and other 18th-century architects. [[Palladian architecture]] became well established in 18th-century Britain.

[[File:WoburnAbbey02.JPG|thumb|left|[[Woburn Abbey]], an excellent example of English Palladianism, designed by [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Burlington's]] student [[Henry Flitcroft]] in 1746.]] 
At the forefront of the new school of design was the aristocratic "architect earl", [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington]]; in 1729, he and [[William Kent]], designed [[Chiswick House]]. This House was a reinterpretation of Palladio's Villa Capra, but purified of 16th century elements and ornament. This severe lack of ornamentation was to be a feature of the Palladianism. In 1734 William Kent and Lord Burlington designed one of England's finest examples of Palladian architecture with [[Holkham Hall]] in [[Norfolk]]. The main block of this house followed Palladio's dictates quite closely, but Palladio's low, often detached, wings of farm buildings were elevated in significance.

This classicising vein was also detectable, to a lesser degree, in the Late Baroque architecture in Paris, such as in [[Claude Perrault|Perrault]]'s east range of the [[Louvre]]. This shift was even visible in Rome at the redesigned façade for [[Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano|S. Giovanni in Laterano]].

===Neoclassicism===
[[File:Berlin Altes Museum Friedrich Thiele 1830.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|[[Altes Museum]], built by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] in Berlin.]]
By the mid 18th century, the movement broadened to incorporate a greater range of Classical influences, including those from [[Ancient Greece]]. The shift to neoclassical architecture is conventionally dated to the 1750s. It first gained influence in England and France; in England, Sir [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|William Hamilton]]'s excavations at [[Pompeii]] and other sites, the influence of the [[Grand Tour]] and the work of [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]] and [[Robert Adam]], was pivotal in this regard. In France, the movement was propelled by a generation of French art students trained in Rome, and was influenced by the writings of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]]. The style was also adopted by progressive circles in other countries such as Sweden and Russia.

An early centre of neoclassicism was Italy, especially [[Naples]], where by the 1730s, court architects such as [[Luigi Vanvitelli]] and [[Ferdinando Fuga]] were recovering classical, Palladian and Mannierist forms in their Baroque architecture (a similar aeathetic move can be seen in the later works of the Piedmontese court architect [[Filippo Juvarra]] in [[Turin]]). Following their lead, [[Giovanni Antonio Medrano]] began to build the first truly neoclassical structures in Italy in the 1730s. In the same period, [[Alessandro Pompei]] introduced neoclassicism to the [[Venetian Republic]], building one of the first lapidariums in Europe in Verona, in the [[Doric style]] (1738). During the same period, neoclassical elements were introduced to [[Tuscany]] by architect [[Jean Nicolas Jadot de Ville-Issey]], the court architect of [[Francis Stephen of Lorraine]]. On Jadot's lead, an original neoclassical style was developed by [[Gaspare Paoletti]], transforming Florence into the most important centre of neoclassicism in the peninsula. In the second half of the century, Neoclassicism flourished also in Turin, [[Milan]] ([[Giuseppe Piermarini]]) and [[Trieste]] ([[Matteo Pertsch]]). In the latter two cities, just as in Tuscany, the sober neoclassical style was linked to the reformism of the ruling Habsburg enlightened monarchs. Nevertheless, the Rococo style remained very much popular in Italy until the Napoleonic regimes, which brought a new archaeological classicism, embraced as a political statement by young, progressive, urban Italians with republican leanings.{{according to whom|date=March 2013}}

International neoclassical architecture was exemplified in [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]'s buildings, especially the [[Altes Museum|Old Museum]] in Berlin, Sir [[John Soane]]'s Bank of England in London and the newly built [[White House]] and [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] in Washington, D.C. of the nascent [[United States|American Republic]]. The style was international.

A second neoclassic wave, more severe, more studied and more consciously archaeological, is associated with the height of the [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleonic Empire]]. In France, the first phase of neoclassicism was expressed in the "Louis XVI style", and the second in the styles called "Directoire" or [[Empire (style)|Empire]]. 

In the decorative arts, neoclassicism is exemplified in French furniture of the Empire style; the English furniture of [[Thomas Chippendale|Chippendale]], [[George Hepplewhite]] and [[Robert Adam]], [[Josiah Wedgwood|Wedgwood]]'s [[bas relief]]s and "black basaltes" [[vase]]s, and the [[Biedermeier]] furniture of Austria. The Scottish architect [[Charles Cameron (architect)|Charles Cameron]] created palatial Italianate interiors for the German-born [[Catherine II the Great]] in [[St. Petersburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/neoclassical-architecture.htm|title=Neoclassical Architecture (1640-1850)|website=www.visual-arts-cork.com|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interior design===
[[File:Château de Malmaison - Appartement de Joséphine 003.jpg|thumb|[[Château de Malmaison]], 1800, room for the [[Empress Joséphine]], on the cusp between [[Directoire style]] and [[Empire style]]]]
Indoors, neoclassicism made a discovery of the genuine classic interior, inspired by the rediscoveries at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. These had begun in the late 1740s, but only achieved a wide audience in the 1760s, with the first luxurious volumes of tightly controlled distribution of ''[[Le Antichità di Ercolano]]'' (''The Antiquities of Herculaneum'').  The antiquities of Herculaneum showed that even the most classicising interiors of the [[Baroque]], or the most "Roman" rooms of [[William Kent]] were based on [[basilica]] and [[temple]] exterior architecture turned outside in, hence their often bombastic appearance to modern eyes: [[pediment]]ed window frames turned into [[gilding|gilded]] mirrors, fireplaces topped with temple fronts.

The new interiors sought to recreate an authentically Roman and genuinely interior vocabulary. Techniques employed in the style included flatter, lighter motifs, sculpted in low [[frieze]]-like relief or painted in monotones ''[[Camaieu|en camaïeu]]'' ("like cameos"),  isolated medallions or vases or busts or ''[[bucrania]]'' or other motifs, suspended on swags of laurel or ribbon, with slender arabesques against backgrounds, perhaps, of "Pompeiian red" or pale tints, or stone colours. The style in France was initially a Parisian style, the ''[[Goût grec]]'' ("Greek style"), not a court style; when [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] acceded to the throne in 1774, [[Marie Antoinette]], his fashion-loving Queen, brought the "Louis XVI" style to court.

However, there was no real attempt to employ the basic forms of Roman furniture until around the turn of the century, and furniture-makers were more likely to borrow from ancient architecture, just as silversmiths were more likely to take from ancient pottery and stone-carving than metalwork: "Designers and craftsmen ... seem to have taken an almost perverse pleasure in transferring motifs from one medium to another".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 110–111, 110 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Adam Style|new phase in neoclassical design]] was inaugurated by Robert and [[James Adam (architect)|James Adam]], who travelled in Italy and Dalmatia in the 1750s, observing the ruins of the classical world. On their return to Britain, they published a book entitled ''The Works in Architecture'' in installments between 1773 and 1779. This book of engraved designs made the ''Adam'' repertory available throughout Europe. The Adam brothers aimed to simplify the [[rococo]] and [[baroque]] styles which had been fashionable in the preceding decades, to bring what they felt to be a lighter and more elegant feel to Georgian houses. ''The Works in Architecture'' illustrated the main buildings the Adam brothers had worked on and crucially documented the interiors, furniture and fittings, designed by the Adams.

===Greek revival===
{{main article|Greek Revival architecture}}
[[File:Saint Isaac's Cathedral in SPB.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|[[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]]]
[[File:PNC Tower Cincinnati - Close-up view.jpg|thumb|Designed by [[Cass Gilbert]], the [[PNC Tower]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], is a prime example of a neoclassical skyscraper with an elaborate Hellenic architecture in the upper portion of the tower]]
From about 1800 a fresh influx of Greek architectural examples, seen through the medium of etchings and engravings, gave a new impetus to neoclassicism, the [[Greek Revival]]. There was little to no direct knowledge of Greek civilization before the middle of the 18th century in [[Western Europe]], when an expedition funded by the [[Society of Dilettanti]] in 1751 and led by [[James Stuart (1713–1788)|James Stuart]] and [[Nicholas Revett]] began serious archaeological enquiry. Stuart was commissioned after his return from Greece by George Lyttelton to produce the first Greek building in England, the garden temple at [[Hagley Hall]] (1758–59).&lt;ref&gt;Though [[Giles Worsley]] detects the first Grecian influenced architectural element in the windows of Nuneham Park from 1756, see [[Giles Worsley]], "The First Greek Revival Architecture", ''The Burlington Magazine'', Vol. 127, No. 985 (April 1985), pp. 226–229.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of British architects in the second half of the century took up the expressive challenge of the Doric from their aristocratic patrons, including [[Joseph Bonomi the Elder|Joseph Bonomi]] and [[John Soane]], but it was to remain the private enthusiasm of connoisseurs up to the first decade of the 19th century.

Seen in its wider social context, Greek Revival architecture sounded a new note of sobriety and restraint in public buildings in Britain around 1800 as an assertion of [[nationalism]] attendant on the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]], the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the clamour for political reform. It was to be [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]]'s winning design for the public competition for [[Downing College, Cambridge]] that announced the Greek style was to be the dominant idiom in architecture. Wilkins and [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]] went on to build some of the most important buildings of the era, including the [[Royal Opera House|Theatre Royal]], [[Covent Garden]] (1808–09), the General Post Office (1824–1829) and the [[British Museum]] (1823–1848), Wilkins [[University College London]] (1826–1830) and the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] (1832–1838). In Scotland, Thomas Hamilton (1784–1858), in collaboration with the artists Andrew Wilson (1780–1848) and Hugh William Williams (1773–1829) created monuments and buildings of international significance; the Burns Monument at Alloway (1818) and the (Royal) High School in Edinburgh (1823–1829).

At the same time the [[Empire style]] in France was a more grandiose wave of neoclassicism in architecture and the decorative arts. Mainly based on Imperial Roman styles, it originated in, and took its name from, the rule of [[Napoleon I]] in the [[First French Empire]], where it was intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state. The style corresponds to the more bourgeois [[Biedermeier]] style in the German-speaking lands, [[Federal style]] in the United States, the [[Regency style]] in Britain, and the ''Napoleonstil'' in Sweden. According to the art historian [[Hugh Honour]] "so far from being, as is sometimes supposed, the culmination of the Neo-classical movement, the Empire marks its rapid decline and transformation back once more into a mere antique revival, drained of all the high-minded ideas and force of conviction that had inspired its masterpieces".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 171–184, 171 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoclassicism continued to be a major force in [[academic art]] through the 19th century and beyond—a constant antithesis to [[Romanticism]] or [[Gothic revival]]s—although from the late 19th century on it had often been considered anti-modern, or even reactionary, in influential critical circles.{{who|date=March 2013}} The centres of several European cities, notably [[St Petersburg]] and [[Munich]], came to look much like museums of Neoclassical architecture.

==Characteristics==
[[File:The White hall of the Gatchina palace.jpg|thumb|A. Rinaldi. The White hall of the Gatchina palace. 1760s. An early example of the Italianate neoclassical interior design in Russian architecture.]]
High neoclassicism was an international movement. Though neoclassical architecture employed the same classical vocabulary as [[Baroque architecture|Late Baroque architecture]], it tended to emphasize its planar qualities, rather than sculptural volumes. Projections and recessions and their effects of [[Chiaroscuro|light and shade]] were more flat; sculptural bas-reliefs were flatter and tended to be enframed in friezes, tablets or panels. Its clearly articulated individual features were isolated rather than interpenetrating, autonomous and complete in themselves.

[[File:L'Enfant plan.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|The L'Enfant Plan for Washington, D.C., as revised by [[Andrew Ellicott]] in 1792.]]
Neoclassicism also influenced city planning; the ancient Romans had used a consolidated scheme for city planning for both defence and civil convenience, however, the roots of this scheme go back to even older civilizations. At its most basic, the [[grid plan|grid system]] of streets, a central forum with city services, two main slightly wider boulevards, and the occasional diagonal street were characteristic of the very logical and orderly Roman design. Ancient façades and building layouts were oriented to these city design patterns and they tended to work in proportion with the importance of public buildings.

Many of these [[urban planning]] patterns found their way into the first modern [[planned cities]] of the 18th century. Exceptional examples include [[Karlsruhe]] and Washington, D.C. Not all planned cities and planned neighbourhoods are designed on neoclassical principles, however. Opposing models may be found in Modernist designs exemplified by [[Brasília]], the [[Garden city movement]], [[levittown]]s, and [[new urbanism]].

==Regional trends==

===Britain===
[[File:Somerset House.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|The central courtyard of[[Sir William Chambers]]' [[Somerset House]] in London.]]
From the middle of the 18th century, exploration and publication changed the course of British architecture towards a purer vision of the Ancient Greco-Roman ideal. [[James Stuart (1713–1788)|James 'Athenian' Stuart]]'s work ''The Antiquities of Athens and Other Monuments of Greece'' was very influential in this regard, as were [[Robert Wood (antiquarian)|Robert Wood]]'s ''Palmyra'' and ''Baalbec''. A combination of simple forms and high levels of enrichment was adopted by the majority of contemporary British architects and designers. The revolution begun by Stuart was soon to be eclipsed by the work of the [[Robert Adam|Adam Brothers]], [[James Wyatt]], [[Sir William Chambers]], [[George Dance the Younger|George Dance]], [[James Gandon]] and provincially based architects such as [[John Carr (architect)|John Carr]] and [[Thomas Harrison (architect)|Thomas Harrison]] of [[Chester]].

In the early 20th century, the writings of [[Albert Richardson]] were responsible for a re-awakening of interest in pure neoclassical design. [[Vincent Harris]] (compare Harris's colonnaded and domed  interior of Manchester Central Reference Library to the colonnaded and domed interior by [[John Carr (architect)|John Carr]] and R R Duke), [[Bradshaw Gass &amp; Hope]] and [[Percy Thomas]] were among those who designed public buildings in the neoclassical style in the [[interwar period]]. In the [[British Raj]] in India, Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]]' monumental city planning for [[New Delhi]] marked the sunset of neoclassicism.
In [[Scotland]] and the north of England, where the Gothic Revival was less strong, architects continued to develop the neoclassical style of [[William Henry Playfair]]. The works of [[Cuthbert Brodrick]] and [[Alexander Thomson]] show that by the end of the 19th century the results could be powerful and eccentric.

===France===
{{main|Neoclassicism in France}}

[[File:Wailly - Chateau de Montmusard - 3.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Château de Montmusard (1765), by [[Charles de Wailly]].]]
The first phase of [[neoclassicism in France]] is expressed in the [[Louis Quinze]] style of architect [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]] ([[Petit Trianon]], 1762–68); the second phase, in the styles called [[Directoire (style)|Directoire]] and "[[Empire (style)|Empire]]", might be characterized by [[Jean Chalgrin]]'s severe astylar [[Arc de Triomphe]] (designed in 1806). In England the two phases might be characterized first by the structures of [[Robert Adam]], the second by those of Sir [[John Soane]]. The interior style in France was initially a Parisian style, the "[[Goût grec]]" ("Greek style") not a court style. Only when the young king acceded to the throne in 1774 did [[Marie Antoinette]], his fashion-loving Queen, bring the [[Louis XVI style]] to court.

From about 1800 a fresh influx of Greek architectural examples, seen through the medium of etchings and engravings, gave a new impetus to neoclassicism that is called the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]]. Although several European cities — notably [[St Petersburg]], [[Athens]], Berlin and [[Munich]] — were transformed into veritable museums of Greek revival architecture, the Greek revival in France was never popular with either the State or the public.

What little there was, started with [[Charles de Wailly]]'s crypt in the church of St Leu-St Gilles (1773–80), and [[Claude Nicolas Ledoux]]'s ''Barriere des Bonshommes'' (1785–89). First-hand evidence of Greek architecture was of very little importance to the French, due to the influence of [[Marc-Antoine Laugier]]'s doctrines that sought to discern the principles of the Greeks instead of their mere practices. It would take until Laboustre's [[Neo-Grec]] of the second Empire for the Greek revival to flower briefly in France.

===Greece===
[[File:Akademie von Athen.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|The [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]] designed by [[Theophil Hansen|Theophil von Hansen]] (1859)]]
[[File:Schliemann mansion 1900.png|thumb|right|upright=1.1|The [[Iliou Melathron]] in 1900]]

After the establishment of the [[Greek Kingdom|Kingdom of Greece]] in 1832, the architecture of Greece was mostly influenced by the Neoclassical architecture. For Athens, the first King of Greece, [[Otto of Greece| Otto I]], commissioned the architects [[Stamatios Kleanthis]] and [[Eduard Schaubert]] to design a modern city plan. The [[Old Royal Palace]] was the first important public building to be built, between 1836 and 1843. Later in the mid and late 19th century, [[Baron Theophil von Hansen|Theophil von Hansen]] and [[Ernst Ziller]] took part in the construction of many neoclassical buildings. Theophil von Hansen designed his first building, the [[National Observatory of Athens]] and two of the three contiguous buildings forming the so-called "Athens Classical Trilogy", namely the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]] (1859) and the [[National Library of Greece]] (1888), the third building of the trilogy being the [[National and Capodistrian University of Athens]] (1843), which was designed by his brother [[Christian Hansen (architect)|Christian Hansen]]. Also he designed the [[Zappeion|Zappeion Hall]] (1888). Ernst Ziller also designed many private mansions in the centre of Athens which gradually became public, usually through donations, such the mansion of [[Heinrich Schliemann]], [[Iliou Melathron]] (1880). The city of [[Nauplio]] is also an important example of Neoclassical Architecture along with the island of [[Poros]].

===Hungary===
[[File:Cathedral, Vác.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Cathedral of [[Vác]] by I. M. A. Ganneval, 1762–1777]]
[[File:Hungarian National Museum, Budapest.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Hungarian National Museum]], [[Budapest]] by Mihály Pollack, 1837-1847]]
The earliest examples of neoclassical architecture in Hungary may be found in [[Vác]]. In this town the triumphal arch and the neoclassical façade of the baroque Cathedral were designed by the French architect Isidor Marcellus Amandus Ganneval (Isidore Canevale) in the 1760s. Also the work of a French architect Charles Moreau is the garden façade of the Esterházy Palace (1797–1805) in Kismarton (today [[Eisenstadt]] in Austria). The two principal architect of Neoclassicism in Hungary was [[Mihály Pollack]] and [[József Hild]]. Pollack's major work is the [[Hungarian National Museum]] (1837–1844). Hild is famous for his designs for the Cathedral of [[Eger]] and [[Esztergom]]. The [[Reformed Great Church of Debrecen]] is an outstanding example of the many Protestant churches that were built in the first half of the 19th century. This was the time of the first iron structures in Hungarian architecture, the most important of which is the [[Chain Bridge (Budapest)]] by [[William Tierney Clark]].

===Malta===
[[File:Malta - Mosta - Triq il-Kbira + Rotunda 01 ies.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Rotunda of Mosta]], which was built between 1833 and 1860]]
Neoclassical architecture was introduced in Malta in the late 18th century, during the final years of [[History of Malta under the Order of Saint John|Hospitaller rule]]. Early examples include the [[National Library of Malta|Bibliotheca]] (1786),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bibliotheca|url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/01141.pdf|website=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|date=28 December 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151206112815/http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/01141.pdf|archivedate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[De Rohan Arch]] (1798)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rohan Gate, Żebbuġ|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20121211/environment/Rohan-Gate-ebbu-.449132|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=11 December 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151204152202/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20121211/environment/Rohan-Gate-ebbu-.449132|archivedate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hompesch Gate]] (1801).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bötig|first1=Klaus|title=Malta, Gozo.

In 1814, a neoclassical [[portico]] decorated with the British coat of arms was added to the [[Main Guard (Valletta)|Main Guard]] building so as to serve as a symbol of British Malta. Other 19th century neoclassical buildings include the [[Monument to Sir Alexander Ball]] (1810), [[RNH Bighi]] (1832), [[St Paul's Pro-Cathedral]] (1844), the [[Rotunda of Mosta]] (1860) and the now-destroyed [[Royal Opera House, Valletta|Royal Opera House]] (1866).&lt;ref name=culturemalta&gt;{{cite web|title=Architecture in Malta under the British|url=http://www.culturemalta.org/48/10/Architecture-in-Malta-under-the-British|website=culturemalta.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007210825/http://www.culturemalta.org/48/10/Architecture-in-Malta-under-the-British|archivedate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoclassicism gave way to other architectural styles by the late 19th century. Few buildings were built in the neoclassical style during the 20th century, such as the [[Domvs Romana]] museum (1922),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Domvs Romana|url=http://heritagemalta.org/museums-sites/domvs-romana/|website=[[Heritage Malta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105055519/http://heritagemalta.org/museums-sites/domvs-romana/|archivedate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Courts of Justice building (Valletta)|Courts of Justice building]] in Valletta (1965–71).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Courts|url=http://www.judiciarymalta.gov.mt/the-courts|website=The Judiciary – Malta|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106133921/http://judiciarymalta.gov.mt/the-courts|archivedate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===
{{main article|Neoclassical architecture in Poland}}
The centre of Polish Neoclassicism was [[Warsaw]] under the rule of the last Polish king [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]]. [[Vilnius University]] was another important centre of the Neoclassical architecture in Europe, led by notable professors of architecture [[Marcin Knackfus]], [[Laurynas Gucevicius]] and [[Karol Podczaszyński]]. The style was expressed in the shape of main public buildings, such as the University's Observatory, [[Vilnius Cathedral]] and the [[Town Hall, Vilnius|town hall]].

The best-known architects and artists, who worked in [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] were [[Dominik Merlini]], [[Jan Chrystian Kamsetzer]], [[Szymon Bogumił Zug]], [[Jakub Kubicki]], [[Antonio Corazzi]], [[Efraim Szreger]], [[Chrystian Piotr Aigner]] and [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]].

===Russia===
{{Main|Neoclassical architecture in Russia|Stalinist architecture}}
In the [[Russian Empire]] at the end of the 19th century, neoclassical architecture was equal to [[Saint Petersburg]] architecture because this style was specific for a huge number of buildings in the city.

In the Soviet Union (1917–1991), neoclassical architecture was very popular among the political elite, as it effectively expressed state power and a vast array of neoclassical building was erected all over the country.

Soviet neoclassical architecture was exported to other socialist countries of the [[Eastern Bloc]], as a gift from the Soviet Union. Examples of this include the [[Palace of Culture and Science]], [[Warsaw]], Poland and the Shanghai International Convention Center in [[Shanghai]], China.

===Spain===
[[File:Museo del Prado 2016 (25185969599).jpg|thumb|[[Prado Museum]] in [[Madrid]], by Juan de Villanueva]]
Spanish Neoclassicism was exemplified by the work of [[Juan de Villanueva]], who adapted [[Edmund Burke|Burke]]'s theories of beauty and the sublime to the requirements of Spanish climate and history. He built the [[Prado Museum]], that combined three functions — an academy, an auditorium and a museum — in one building with three separate entrances.

This was part of the ambitious program of [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]], who intended to make Madrid the Capital of the Arts and Sciences. Very close to the museum, Villanueva built the Astronomical Observatory. He also designed several summer houses for the kings in [[El Escorial]] and [[Aranjuez]] and reconstructed the Major Square of [[Madrid]], among other important works. Villanueva´s pupils expanded the Neoclassical style in Spain.

===The Third Reich===
{{main article|Nazi architecture}}
Neoclassical architecture was the preferred style by the leaders of the National Socialist movement in the [[Third Reich]], especially admired by [[Adolf Hitler]] himself. Hitler commissioned his favourite architect, [[Albert Speer]], to plan a re-design of Berlin as a city comprising imposing neoclassical structures, which would be renamed as [[Welthauptstadt Germania]], the centrepiece of Hitler's Thousand Year Reich.

These plans never came to fruition due to the eventual downfall of Nazi Germany and the [[Death of Adolf Hitler|suicide of its leader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akinblog.nl/2008/03/welthauptstadt-germania-hilters-vision.html|title=Welthauptstadt Germania – Hitler's vision of a new Berlin|last=Akin|first=Akintayo|date=24 March 2008|website=http://akinblog.nl|publisher=akinblog.nl|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708013905/http://akin.blog-city.com/welthauptstadt_germania.htm|archivedate=8 July 2011|deadurl=No|accessdate=5 July 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the new republic, [[Robert Adam]]'s neoclassical manner was adapted for the local late 18th and early 19th-century style, called "[[Federal architecture]]". One of the pioneers of this style was English-born [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]], who is often noted as one of the first formally trained America's professional architects and the father of American architecture. The [[Baltimore Basilica]], the first [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral in the United States, is considered by many experts to be Latrobe's masterpiece.

The widespread use of neoclassicism in American architecture, as well as by French revolutionary regimes, and the general tenor of [[rationalism]] associated with the movement, all created a link between neoclassicism and [[republicanism]] and [[Political radicalism|radicalism]] in much of Europe. The [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] can be seen as an attempt to present a [[monarchism|monarchist]] and [[conservatism|conservative]] alternative to neoclassicism.

In later 19th-century American architecture, neoclassicism was one expression of the [[American Renaissance]] movement, ''ca'' 1880–1917. Its last manifestation was in [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] (1885–1920), and its very last, large public projects in the United States include the [[Lincoln Memorial]] (1922), the [[National Gallery of Art|National Gallery]] in Washington, D.C. (1937), and the [[American Museum of Natural History]]'s Roosevelt Memorial (1936).

Today, there is a small revival of Classical Architecture as evidenced by the groups such as The Institute of Classical Architecture and Classical America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicist.org/ |title=The Institute of Classical Architecture &amp; Art |publisher=Classicist.org |date= |accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The School of Architecture at the University of Notre Dame, currently teaches a fully Classical curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://architecture.nd.edu/arch_home.aspx |title=University of Notre Dame School of Architecture at the |publisher=Architecture.nd.edu |date= |accessdate=11 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709215939/http://architecture.nd.edu/arch_home.aspx |archivedate=9 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==

After a lull during the period of modern architectural dominance (roughly post-World War II until the mid-1980s), neoclassicism has seen somewhat of a resurgence.  This rebirth can be traced to the movement of [[New Urbanism]] and [[postmodern architecture]]'s embrace of classical elements as ironic, especially in light of the dominance of Modernism. While some continued to work with classicism as ironic, some architects such as [[Thomas Gordon Smith]], began to consider classicism seriously.  
While some schools had interest in classical architecture, such as the [[University of Virginia]], no school was purely dedicated to classical architecture. In the early 1990s a program in classical architecture was started by Smith and [[Duncan Stroik]] at the [[University of Notre Dame]] that continues successfully.&lt;ref&gt;[http://architecture.nd.edu/academics/ School of Architecture at the University of Notre Dame] "Twenty years ago the curriculum was reformed to focus on traditional and classical architecture and urbanism."&lt;/ref&gt; Programs at the [[University of Miami]], [[Andrews University]], [[Judson University]] and [[The Prince's Foundation for Building Community]] have trained a number of new classical architects since this resurgence. Today one can find numerous buildings embracing neoclassical style, since a generation of architects trained in this discipline shapes urban planning.

As of the first decade of the 21st century, contemporary neoclassical architecture is usually classed under the umbrella term of [[New Classical Architecture]]. Sometimes it is also referred to as [[Historicism (art)|Neo-Historicism]]/[[Revivalism (architecture)|Revivalism]], Traditionalism or simply ''neoclassical architecture'' like the historical style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arch-tour.blogspot.com/2009/03/neo-classicist-architecture.html Neo-classicist Architecture. Traditionalism. Historicism.]&lt;/ref&gt; For sincere traditional-style architecture that sticks to regional architecture, materials and craftsmanship, the term [[Vernacular architecture|Traditional Architecture]] (or ''vernacular'') is mostly used. The [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] is awarded to major contributors in the field of 21st century traditional or classical architecture, and comes with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist [[Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/ Driehaus Prize for New Classical Architecture at Notre Dame SoA]: "Together, the $200,000 Driehaus Prize and the $50,000 Reed Award represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment"; retained 7 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

;Regional developments
In the [[United States of America|United States]] various contemporary public buildings are built in neoclassical style, with the 2006 [[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]] in [[Nashville]] being an example.

In Britain a number of architects are active in the neoclassical style. Two new university Libraries, [[Quinlan Terry]]'s Maitland Robinson Library at [[Downing College]] and [[ADAM Architecture]]'s [[Sackler Library]] illustrate that the approach taken can range from the traditional, in the former case, to the unconventional, in the latter case. Recently, [[Prince Charles]] came under controversy for promoting a classically designed development on the land of the former [[Chelsea Barracks]] in London. Writing to the [[House of Thani|Qatari Royal family]] (who were funding the development through the property development company [[Qatari Diar]]) he condemned the accepted modernist plans, instead advocating a classical approach. His appeal was met with success and the plans were withdrawn. A new design by architecture firm Dixon Jones is currently being drafted.&lt;ref name="ya"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/25/prince-charles-chelsea-barracks-planning|title=Prince Charles's role in Chelsea barrack planning row 'unwelcome'|publisher=[[The Guardian|Guardian]]|accessdate=15 January 2011|location=London|first=Robert|last=Booth|date=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ROMA Design Group''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] firm of [[architects]], [[landscape architects]], and [[urban planners]] based in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], USA. It was founded in the 1940s by American architect George Rockrise.

==History==
ROMA Design Group was founded in the late 1940s by George Rockrise, an architect with a strong interest in landscape and site design who began his career in [[California]] working for the landscape architect [[Thomas Dolliver Church]].&lt;ref name="SFG Rockrise obit"&gt;Jim Doyle (July 14, 2000) [http://articles.sfgate.com/2000-07-14/news/17653947_1_architect-and-urban-planner-urban-research-association-bay-area "George T. Rockrise"], ''San Francisco Chronicle''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1960 and 1980, Rockrise expanded the firm to include Bob Odermatt, Bob Mountjoy, and Jim Amis as Principals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt3d5nb17s&amp;doc.view=entire_text&amp;brand=default George T. Rockrise Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s Boris Dramov, Bonnie Fisher, and Jim Adams became Principals, having met at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]].  Jim Adams later went on to open ROMA's offices in [[Austin, Texas]].

In 2000, ROMA's design for the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] was selected as the winning submission in an international [[architectural design competition]].&lt;ref name=mlkmemorial&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/A-Dream-Written-in-Stone-S-F-firm-designing-3302962.php#photo-2451239|title=SFGate: A Dream Written in Stone / S.F. firm designing Martin Luther King memorial in Washington|date=October 10, 2000|author=Jesse Hamlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm is currently under the leadership of Boris Dramov, [[FAIA]], [[American Institute of Certified Planners|FAICP]], Design Principal and Bonnie Fisher, [[American Society of Landscape Architects|FASLA]], Landscape Principal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roma.com/about.html About Us], ROMA Design Group&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable projects==

[[Image:Santa Monica Third Street Promenade, Jane Lidz.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Third Street Promenade]], Santa Monica]]
Since the 1950s ROMA Design Group has become known for a wide variety of architecture projects, including San Francisco's [[Cathedral School for Boys|Cathedral School]], the [[Bahrain]]'s U.S. Embassy in [[Manama]], the Domaine Chandon Winery in [[Yountville, California]], [[Oregon]]'s Sun River Resort, and the Inn at the Tides in [[Bodega Bay, California|Bodega Bay]].&lt;ref name="SFG Rockrise obit" /&gt; 

ROMA Design Group has become known for revitalizing declining urban districts of at least 25 cities,&lt;ref name="SFG Rockrise obit" /&gt; for example [[Suisun City, California]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terrain.org/unsprawl/3/ Unsprawl Case Study, Suisun City], Terrain.org.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the firm has long been associated with the transformation of the [[San Francisco]] waterfront after the demolition of the [[Embarcadero Freeway]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baycrossings.com/archives/2000/09_October/newsmaker.htm Bay Crossings: Boris Dramov, Architectural Visionary and Creator of a new waterfront and gateway to San Francisco]&lt;/ref&gt; ROMA's new Ferry Terminal was welcomed by the ''Baycrossing Magazine'', saying the terminal created new hope for the city. According to Boris Dramov, "The effect is intended to speak to the role this space has as a gathering place, counter-pointing the modern and the traditional. You see it with the granite portals through which passengers pass to enter the floats. The stainless steel on floats’ canopies recalls the new trolley stops."&lt;ref name="Crossings lurching"&gt;[http://www.baycrossings.com/Archives/2001/09_October/san_francisco_ferry_terminal_project_lunching_to_the_finish_line.htm "San Francisco Ferry Terminal Project Lurching to the Finish Line"], Baycrossings Magazine, October 9, 2001.

'''Rotring''' (stylized '''rOtring''') is a [[Germany|German]] technical writing and drawing instruments company based in [[Hamburg]].

==History==
[[File:Rotring pens.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Rotring mechanical pencils]]
The company was established in 1928 as "Tintenkuli Handels GmbH". The company's first product was the Tintenkuli, a stylographic pen—a [[fountain pen]] with a narrow steel tube instead of a conventional nib. While stylographic pens were already common in America and in fact pre-dated conventional fountain pens, they had not been previously marketed in Europe, and Rotring would eventually become the name associated with such pens throughout the world.

"Rot ring" directly translates to red ring - which is still placed around the barrel of their pens today. The company's name was changed to Rotring in the early 70s to match the trademark.

Although stylographs never overtook fountain pens for use in writing, by 1953 the Rotring "Rapidograph" became the prototypical [[technical pen]] of its age. Its technology virtually replaced the [[ruling pen]] and greatly simplified technical drawing. Rapidographs are still made today, both by Rotring and by [[Koh-i-Noor Hardtmuth|Koh-i-Noor]], its US subsidiary.

The advent in the 1990s of [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) saw the partial demise of the technical drawing pen. To combat this, Rotring diversified its range of graphic pens, pencils and markers.

In 1998 Rotring was taken over by [[Sanford L.P.|Sanford]], an American company specialising in graphic products and part of [[Newell Rubbermaid]] Inc. since 1992 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Newell Rubbermaid history | url=http://www.newellrubbermaid.com/Images/UploadedDocument/DOC000269.pdf | publisher=Newell Rubbermaid | date=10 June 2011 | accessdate=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Three years after the events in ''[[Runemarks]]'', the Middle World has changed again. After the destruction of the Order, the surviving gods, having rescued their friends from the Black Fortress of Netherworld, have regrouped in the village of Malbry. The General is dead and chances of rebuilding Asgard seem remote. But a prophecy, coupled with the appearance of unnatural creatures in the Middle Worlds, reveal a breach in Chaos, which may lead to another Apocalypse. Once more, Maddy and her friends are forced to confront an enemy. This time, the enemy is one of their own, a renegade from World's End - Maddy's twin sister. They are both the daughters of [[Thor]].

'''''Signum manus''''' (sometimes also known as ''Chrismon'') refers to the medieval practice, current from the [[Merovingian period]] until the 14th century in the [[Frankish Empire]] and its successors, of signing a document or charter with a special type of [[monogram]] or [[royal cypher]].

The term ''Chrismon'' was introduced in [[New Latin]] specifically as a term for the [[Chi Rho]] monogram. As this symbol was used in Merovingian documents at the starting point of what would diversify into the tradition of "cross-signatures", German scholarship of the 18th century extended use of the term ''Chrismon'' to the entire field.&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/MKL1888:Chrismon Chrismon] in ''Meyers Konversations-Lexikon'' 4th ed. (1888/9).&lt;/ref&gt; In medievalist [[paleography]] and ''Diplomatik'' (''ars diplomaticae'', i.e. the study of [[:wikt:diploma#Latin|documents or charters]]), the study of these signatures or sigils was known as ''Chrismologia'' or ''Chrismenlehre'', while the study of [[Christian cross variants|cross variants]] was known as ''Staurologia''.&lt;ref&gt;from ''[[stauros]]'' "stake, cross"; the same term ''Staurologia'' in a different context may also refer to the field of [[Theology of the Cross]].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chrismon'' in this context may refer to the [[Merovingian period]] abbreviation ''I. C. N.'' for ''in Christi nomine'', later (in the [[Carolingian period]]) also ''I. C.'' for ''in Christo'', and still later (in the high medieval period) just ''C.'' for ''Christus''.&lt;ref&gt;  Gatterer (1798), 
[https://books.google.ch/books?id=NaRAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA64  p. 64f].&lt;/ref&gt;

A cross symbol was often drawn as an invocation at the beginning of documents in the early medieval West. 
At the end of documents, commissioners or witnesses would sign with a ''signum manus'', often also in the form of a simple cross. This practice is widespread in Merovingian documents of the 7th and 8th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Garipzanov (2008:161f)&lt;/ref&gt; A related development is the widespread use of the cross symbol on the obverse side of early medieval coins, interpreted as the ''signum manus'' of the moneyer.&lt;ref&gt;Garipzanov (2008:163f)&lt;/ref&gt;
The tradition of minting coins with the monogram of the ruling monarch on the obverse side originates in the 5th century, both in Byzantium and in Rome. This tradition was continued in the 6th century by Germanic kings, including the Merovingians. These early designs were ''box'' monograms. The first ''cruciform'' monogram was used by [[Justinian I]] in the 560s. [[Tiberius III]] used a cruciform monogram with the letters ''R, M'' for Rome and ''T, B'' for Tiberius; [[Pope Gregory III]] used the letters ''G, R, E, O''.&lt;ref&gt;Garipzanov (2008:173)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The earliest surviving Merovingian royal charters, dating to the 7th century, have the box monograms of [[Chlothar II]] and [[Clovis II]].&lt;ref&gt;Garipzanov (2008:167)&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 7th century, the use of royal monograms was abandoned entirely by the Merovingian kings; instead, royal wax seals were first attached to the documents, and the kings would sign their name in full.

The ''signum manus'' in the form of a modified cross symbol first appears in charters of both Frankish Gaul and Anglo-Saxon England in the late 7th and early 8th century. [[Charlemagne]]  first used his cruciform monogram, likely inspired by the earlier papal monograms, in 769, and he would continue to use it for the rest of his reign. The monogram spells ''KAROLVS'', with the 
consonants ''K, R, L, S'' at the ends of the cross-arms, and the vowels ''A, O, V'' displayed in ligature at the center.&lt;ref&gt;Garipzanov (2008:172)&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Louis the Pious]] abandoned the cross monogram, using again a H-type or box monogram.&lt;ref&gt;Garipzanov (2008:182)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Teatro Carignano''' ('''Carignano Theatre''') is a theatre in [[Turin]] and one of the oldest and most important theatres in Italy. Designed by [[Benedetto Alfieri]], it is located opposite the [[Palazzo Carignano]]. Building commenced in 1752 and the theatre was inaugurated the following year with a performance of [[Baldassare Galuppi]]'s opera, ''Calamità de' cuori''. Much of the theatre was destroyed in a fire in 1786, but it was rebuilt in a few months using Alfieri's original plans. Since then it has undergone several renovations. Although today it is primarily used for performances of plays, in the past it was an important [[opera house]]. The theatre is owned by the City of Turin but administered by the theatre company, Teatro Stabile di Torino, and is one of the company's principal performing venues.

'''''The Eternal Frame''''' (1975) is a video-based art installation documenting the reenactment of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] in [[Dealey Plaza]] in a collaboration between two San Francisco-based artist collectives: T.R. Uthco (Diane Andrews Hall, Doug Hall, Jody Procter) and [[Ant Farm (group)|Ant Farm]] ([[Chip Lord]], Doug Michels, Curtis Schreier). The artists taking on the roles of [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]], his wife [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline]], and others, rehearsed extensively to ensure verisimilitude, and when they performed the reenactment, it was executed with a striking attention to detail. While part of the video shows the artists playing on America's obsession with the media (T. R. Uthco's Jody Procter in his role as a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent tells a camera, "We've always been worried about Dallas–it's a rough city, a gun city"), ultimately the video shows that the sacred images of the assassination cannot be mocked. This piece can be seen as a commentary on the pervasive media culture in America, as it explores how the Kennedy assassination itself became a new type of media event.

The title plays on the [[John F. Kennedy Eternal Flame|eternal flame]] at Kennedy's gravesite.

The work is part of the [[Tate]] collection.

The '''Vick Foundation''' was established &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vickfoundation.com/en/index.html Official site]&lt;/ref&gt; in February 2004 to award an annual prize for best [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] [[novel]]. There is also a competition for the most popular short-listed book, based on votes cast by the general public. In 2008, the award will celebrate its 5th anniversary, and the foundation is on the path to becoming an institution in Bulgaria.

==History==
Vick's initiative was acclaimed by those who saw in the prize a new opportunity for the Bulgarian literature after almost 15 years of standstill.

A permanent committee, which includes [[Stefan Danailov]], the current Minister of Culture of [[Bulgaria]], elects а jury. Other members in the committee are Raymond Wagenstein, Boyan Biolchev, Nedyalko Yordanov, Hristo Droumev and Ivan Granitski. The jury changes each year and they select a short list of six Bulgarian novels from which the winner is chosen. One of the member making up the 2008 jury is [[Meglena Kuneva]], the current European commissioner in [[Bulgaria]].

The aim of the foundation is also to enable others to gain access into Bulgarian literature, especially for the literary world beyond Bulgaria.

The award ceremony each year is well attended by members of Bulgarian society and journalist, as can be seen by the [http://www.vickfoundation.com/bg/gallery.html photo gallery on the website]. The event is covered by TV channels in Bulgaria and causes quite a media furor annually. [[KariZa]] and other well-known performers have graced the stages during the award ceremony and the ceremonies are known to be of much entertainment value.

The competition is organised with the support of [[Translation Company EVS]]

The Kentucky '''Women Writers Conference''' had its beginnings in 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Food writer Ruth Reichl will speak at Kentucky Women Writers Conference|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2011/12/10/1989169/food-writer-ruth-reichle-will.html|newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader|date=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a celebration of women writers at the [[University of Kentucky]] (UK). That first year featured [[Maya Angelou]], [[Toni Cade Bambara]], [[Ruth Stone]], [[Alice Walker]], and [[Ruth Whitman]]. Since then, it has become the longest-running annual festival of women writers in the nation, showcasing the talents and issues addressed by established and emerging authors.

UK History faculty Nancy Dye had suggested using surplus funds from Undergraduate Studies to bring women writers to campus. A 16-member committee from the departments of English, Honors, Undergraduate Studies, and Special Collections, along with members of the Lexington community, produced the conference. In 1984–1985 the conference was directed by UK English faculty Jane Gentry Vance, who later served as Kentucky's Poet Laureate.

In 1985–1993, the conference was affiliated with Continuing Education for Women/University Extension and directed by Betty Gabehart. As the conference's longest-running director, Gabehart made significant contributions to its enduring legacy and stability, establishing much of the reputation it enjoys today. In 1994–1996, the conference was affiliated with the Women's Studies Program and directed by Jan Oaks, faculty in English and Gender and Women's Studies. In 1997, former Conference assistant Patti DeYoung served as director.

In 1998 the conference lost university funding when it was unable to find a sponsoring department, and its advisory board established itself as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization. Its new home became the Carnegie Center for Literacy and Learning in downtown Lexington, and it was renamed the Kentucky Women Writers Conference. Its director during those years, 1998–2002, was Jan Isenhour, also director of the Carnegie Center, and its work was carried out by a volunteer board.

In 2002 President Lee Todd reinstated support for the conference to demonstrate the university's commitment to women's programming and community events. Since then, the Conference leadership has continued cultivating wide community support through many partnerships and the committed efforts of its board and volunteers. UK provides staff salaries, office space, and the majority of KWWC's operating expenses. Financial support from the [[Kentucky Foundation for Women]], LexArts, the Kentucky Arts Council, the [[Kentucky Humanities Council]], businesses, and individual patrons remains critical to our ability to attract writers of the highest caliber.

Directors since then have been Brenda Weber (2003) and Rebecca Gayle Howell (2004–06). Howell launched several free community events that have become signature offerings of the conference, including the Gypsy Slam, the [[Sonia Sanchez]] Series, and the Hardwick/Jones keynote reading on mentorship and collaboration. In 2007, Julie Kuzneski Wrinn became Conference director. The 38th annual conference will be held September 15-16, 2017 in Lexington, Kentucky.
