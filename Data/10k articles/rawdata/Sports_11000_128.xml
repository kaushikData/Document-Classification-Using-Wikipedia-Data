The '''[[1973–74 WHA season|1973–74]] [[Toronto Toros]] season''' was the team's first season in Toronto, as they spent their inaugural season as the [[Ottawa Nationals]] in [[1972-73 Ottawa Nationals season|1972-73]].  
{{TOClimit|limit=2}}

==Offseason==
The Nationals were moved to Toronto and sold to [[John F. Bassett]], son of former [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] part owner [[John Bassett]].  The new owner renamed team the Toros, as its short for Toronto, and it is also a Spanish bull.  To attract attention, Bassett signed 18-year-old [[Toronto Marlboros]] star [[Wayne Dillon]], and former Maple Leafs defenseman [[Carl Brewer (ice hockey)|Carl Brewer]] to anchor the blueline.  The Toros also thought they had a deal to sign Maple Leafs star player [[Darryl Sittler]] to a five-year, $1 million contract, however, Sittler decided to return to the Leafs.

The Toros originally planned to move the team into a renovated [[CNE Coliseum]], while [[Bill Ballard]], the son of Maple Leafs owner [[Harold Ballard]] and was running [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] due to his father being in prison, was opposed of the renovation and wanted the team to play in the Gardens.  The Toros decided to spend the season at [[Varsity Arena]], which seated 4,860 fans.

As the [[Ottawa Nationals]] the previous season, the team finished in fourth place in the Eastern Division with a 35-39-4 record, losing to the [[New England Whalers]] in the first round of the playoffs.

==Regular season==
The first game for the Toros was played on October 7, 1973, at [[Varsity Arena]], with Toronto tying the [[Chicago Cougars]] 4-4.  The Toros would get off to a sluggish start, going 0-2-2 in their first four games before defeating the [[Los Angeles Sharks]] 3-0 on the road.  The team continued to slump, and through their first twelve games, sat with a record of 2-7-3.  Toronto would break out of their slump though, and post a record of 17-11-0 in their next 28 games to go over the .500 for the first time.  The Toros would keep up their great play, and end the season in second place in the Eastern Division, with a 41-33-4 record, earning 86 points, which was a twelve-point improvement over the previous season.  Head coach [[Billy Harris (ice hockey b. 1935)|Billy Harris]] won the [[Howard Baldwin Trophy]], presented to the Coach of the Year.

Offensively, Toronto was led by [[Wayne Carleton]], who finished with a team high 37 goals and 92 points and finished sixth in league scoring.  [[Gavin Kirk]] had another solid season, earning 68 points in 78 games, while rookie [[Wayne Dillon]] earned 65 points in 71 games.  The defense was led by [[Brian Gibbons (ice hockey b. 1947)|Brian Gibbons]], who had 35 points, while [[Carl Brewer (ice hockey)|Carl Brewer]] chipped in with 25 points.  [[Rick Cunningham (ice hockey)|Rick Cunningham]] led the Toros with 88 penalty minutes.

In goal, [[Gilles Gratton]] had the majority of playing time, winning 26 games while posting a GAA of 3.53, along with two shutouts.  [[Les Binkley]] backed him up, winning 14 games with a team best 3.27 GAA, and a shutout.

The '''1st Extreme Ironing World Championships''' was the inaugural championship for the quirky British sport of [[extreme ironing]].

The first event, held in mid-September 2002 in [[Valley, Bavaria]], a small village near [[Munich, Germany|Munich]] in the district [[Miesbach (district)|Miesbach]], was host to competitors from ten nations, comprising 12 teams (three were from [[United Kingdom|Britain]]).

==Competing countries==
* [[Austria]]
* [[Australia]]
* [[Chile]]
* [[Croatia]]
* [[Great Britain]]; three teams called GB1, GB2, GB3
* [[Germany]]

==Ironing championship sections==
*'''Urban'''- Involved ironing in/on/around a broken down car.
*'''Water'''- A fast flowing river was the location for this station. Competitors could use surfboards, canoes or rubber rings to help them.
*'''Forest'''- Ironing at the top of a tree did not suit all the competitors.
*'''Lauda'''- A purpose built climbing wall, which ironists had to climb and iron a T-shirt.
*'''Freestyle'''- The section where "anything goes".

==Results==
The GB1 and GB3 teams managed to win the gold and bronze team medals. German and Austrian competitors picked up the individual prizes.

Competitors were tested on their abilities to cope with five arduous ironing tests on a variety of fabrics and in different environments ranging from rocky to forest, urban and water.
A 70-strong contingent gathered in a muddy field to combine the often mundane household task with "extreme" pursuits such as rock climbing.
They were judged on their creative ironing skills as well as the creases in the clothing.
The British team prepared for the championships in different locations such as Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon in the hope of winning prizes including a holiday in Hawaii, [[washing machine]]s and other household goods.

[[File:Hänninhauta 2014.JPG|250px|thumb|A bandy field in Finland at the end of the first half of a match. The skaters in yellow vests in the foreground are [[ball boy]]s.]]

A '''bandy field''' or '''bandy rink''' is an [[ice rink]] used for playing [[bandy]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|last=Klein|first=Jeff Z.|title=It’s Not Hockey, It’s Bandy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/sports/olympics/29bandy.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally, bandy was played on naturally frozen ice, mainly on lakes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaltmuseum.se/011013013430 Digitaltmuseum]&lt;/ref&gt; Teams often had to take time to go out and search for the best ice to use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nordvarmland.com/istid/page.php?id=3725 IFK Likenäs], "Sven Olsson och Rune Håkansson rekar efter bra is för bandyplan."&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, ice started to be created on soccer pitches in the wintertime, allowing for a more safe place to play. This may be the reason the outer measurements are the same as for a soccer field. The first artificially frozen bandy field was created in [[Budapest]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungary]], in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www8.idrottonline.se/DjurgardensIFBandyforening-Bandy/Sponsorer/ |publisher=[[Djurgårdens IF Bandy|Djurgårdens IF]] |title=Sponsorer |language=Swedish |accessdate=25 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325044742/http://www8.idrottonline.se/DjurgardensIFBandyforening-Bandy/Sponsorer/ |archivedate=25 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, indoor arenas started to be built, allowing for a longer season. The world's first indoor bandy arena, the [[Olympic Stadium (Moscow)|Olimpiyskiy]], was built in [[Moscow]] for the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] but has hosted many bandy events since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eventtravel.com/Olimpiiski-Moscow-2|publisher=Event Travel|title=Olympinski Moscow|access-date=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of a bandy field is regulated in section 1.1 of the Bandy Playing Rules set up by the [[Federation of International Bandy]]&lt;ref name=rules&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf |title=Bandy Playing Rules |publisher=Federation of International Bandy |date=1 September 2011 |accessdate=8 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181936/http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf |archivedate=11 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It shall be rectangular and in the range {{convert|4050|-|7150|m2}} ({{convert|45|–|65|m}} by {{convert|90|–|110|m}}), about the same size as a [[Association football pitch|football pitch]] for [[association football]] and considerably larger than an [[ice hockey rink]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehockeywriters.com/bandy-the-other-ice-hockey/|title=Bandy: The Other Ice Hockey|author=Eric Converse|date=May 17, 2013|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For international play, the field must not be smaller than {{convert|100|m}} times {{convert|60|m}}. The field is outlined with distinct and unbroken lines according to section 1.1. These lines are red and between {{convert|5|-|8|cm}} wide, according to section 1.1 D.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;
[[Image:Bandy pitch metric.svg|700px|thumb|center|Standard field measurements, set in the Bandy Playing Rules]]

===Sidelines and borders===
Along the sidelines, section 1.2 of the Rules prescribes the use of a {{convert|15|cm|0|abbr=on}} high border (board, vant, sarg, wand, wall) to be placed to prevent the [[Bandy ball|ball]] from leaving the ice. It should not be attached to the ice, it should be able to glide upon collisions, and should end {{convert|1|–|3|m}} away from the corners, to allow for corner-strokes. The top should have soft protection, to avoid players getting hurt if touching it when coming at high speed.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt; The border was originally only used in Russia, but was introduced to other countries in the 1950s when the rules of the game were standardized and the international governing federation was founded. It allows for a faster game, as the ball stays in play instead of easily leaving the field, which means it would have to be collected and thrown in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iof1.idrottonline.se/SvenskaBandyforbundet/Bandynyheter/Classeshistoriskahorna/Aldrekronikor/Sargensentreforandradebandyn/ |title=Sargens entré förändrade bandyn |language=Swedish |author=Claes-G Bengtsson |date=23 November 2007 |accessdate=22 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118050153/http://iof1.idrottonline.se/SvenskaBandyforbundet/Bandynyheter/Classeshistoriskahorna/Aldrekronikor/Sargensentreforandradebandyn/ |archivedate=18 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the border is frozen to the ice during play, this can be hazardous to the players, and the referee can therefore decide to start or continue the game without such border. The same applies if strong wind relocates the border, under such circumstances the match can also be started or continued without border. This is regulated in comment section C1.8 of the Rules.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;

The border is made of sections which each should be about {{convert|4|m}} long according to section 1.2 of the Rules.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt; Section 1.3 of the Rules prescribes where players must and must not enter or leave the field: Four of these sections of the border shall be painted red on the front side as well as on the backside. These four sections are placed at the middle of the side-line on one side of the field, in front of the players' benches. All exchange of players from both teams must take place over these red-painted border pieces, i.e. over a part of the border which is about 16 m long.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt; According to comment section C3.3 of the Rules, a player who is to be replaced, shall have left the rink before the replacing player can enter the game.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt; Section 1.3  also states that the erroneous exchange of players is to be punished with a penalty of 5 minutes for the in-going player (this length of penalty is shown by the referee displaying a white [[penalty card]]).&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;

===Centre line and corners===
A centre spot denotes the centre of the field and a circle of radius {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}} is centered at it. A centre-line is drawn through the centre spot and parallel with the shortlines.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;

At each of the corners, a {{convert|1|m|abbr=on}} radius quarter-circle is drawn, and a dotted line is painted parallel to the shortline and {{convert|5|m}} away from it without extending into the penalty area. The dotted line can be replaced with a {{convert|0.5|m|adj=on}} long line starting at the edge of the penalty area and extending towards the sideline, {{convert|5|m}} from the shortline.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;

===The goal cage===
Centered at each short-line is a {{convert|3.5|m|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|2.1|m|abbr=on}} high goal cage,&lt;ref name=aba&gt;{{cite web|title=American Bandy Association|url=http://www.usabandy.com/page/show/604524-american-bandy-association|work=About ABA|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; regulated to size, form, material and other properties in section 1.4 of the Rules. The cage may be made of wood, aluminium or steel and has a net to stop the ball when it has crossed the goal-line.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt; The goal-line is the line between the goalposts; section 1.1.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt; The cage shall be of an approved model; the approvement is made by the appropriate governing body. It shall be fitted with small spikes on underside to prevent the goal from being moved by the wind or by minor touch of a player, so that it stays in place. As long as the goal cage stays in place, the match can go on. For safety reasons, the goal-posts shall not have any sharp edges. The goal cage also has two ball baskets, one on each outer side; section 1.4 A. Balls are stored there for the goal-keeper to use when he is to set a ball in play if the ball has been shot over the end line at the side of the goal by a player from the opponent team.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt; This allows the game to start up quicker when this has happened.

In front of the goal cage is a half-circular penalty area with a {{convert|17|m|abbr=on}} radius. A penalty spot is located {{convert|12|m}} in front of the goal and there are two free-stroke spots at the penalty area line, each surrounded by a {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}} circle.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;

==Condition of the ice==

Especially for naturally frozen ice, it may occur that the ice is in too bad condition to play on. The ice shall be inspected by the referee before the game. If the referee deems that the condition of the ice is too bad, comment sections C1.1 and C1.2 allows him to decide that the match has to be cancelled. No one but the referee is allowed to decide on cancellation because of the condition of the ice (but this does not mean that either team is unable to alert the attention of the referee regarding some part of the condition of the ice).&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;

Deficiencies of the rink, including inferior ice quality, are the responsibility of the organiser of the match and according to comment section C1.4 deficiencies shall be reported to the administrative authority.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;

==Outdoors and indoors arenas==
Originally, bandy was played on frozen lakes, but soon football fields were started to be used, by pouring water on them in the wintertime to get a good, flat and safe ice surface.

Starting in the 1980s, and increasingly since 2000, more and more indoor bandy arenas have been built, especially in Russia and Sweden.

'''[[Benin]]''' made its [[Paralympic Games]] début at the [[2000 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Sydney]], sending a single representative ([[Edouard Agboessi]]) to compete in athletics. The country has competed at every edition of the [[Summer Paralympics]] since then, but has never taken part in the [[Winter Paralympics]]. No competitor for Benin has ever won a medal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/Results/search.html?npc=BEN&amp;gender=all&amp;medal=all&amp;sport=all&amp;games=all Benin at the Paralympics], [[International Paralympic Committee]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Bolivia]]''' first participated at the '''[[Olympic Games]]''' in 1936. The nation has sent athletes to compete in every [[Summer Olympic Games]] since 1964, except when they participated in the [[American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]]. The nation has also participated in the [[Winter Olympic Games]] on several occasions since 1956, but not since 1992.

To date, no athlete from Bolivia has ever won an Olympic medal, making it the only South American country never to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/sport/meet-the-worst-ever-olympic-nations--and-how-some-of-them-could-finally-win-a-medal-in-rio-747579.html]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the National U15 Football team has won a gold medal for the country at the [[Youth Olympic Games]] in Singapore 2010.

[[File:King Kenny vs Bolton 2011.jpg|thumb|right|202px|[[Kenny Dalglish]] temporarily served as the caretaker manager of 
[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in 2011, following the sacking of [[Roy Hodgson]]. He was eventually promoted to permanent manager.]]

In [[association football]]ing terms, a '''caretaker manager''' is somebody who takes temporary charge of the management of a [[football club]], usually when the regular [[Manager (association football)|manager]] is dismissed, or leaves for a different club. However, a caretaker may also be appointed if the regular manager is suspended, ill or unable to attend to their usual duties. Caretaker managers are normally appointed at short notice from within the club, usually the assistant manager, a senior coach, or an experienced player.  In other sports, the term "interim manager" is more commonly used.

==Caretaker managers in Eastern Europe==
Caretaker managers in Eastern Europe are [[head coach]]es that carry prefix title '''performing duties''' or sometimes temporary performing duties. These managers do not have a required license ([[UEFA Pro Licence]]) to be full pledged head coaches (managers).

==Caretaker managers in practice==
Famous examples include long-standing [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] assistant manager [[Stewart Houston]], who stepped in after [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] was abruptly sacked in the middle of the [[1994-95 in English football|1994–95]] season and guided the club to the [[1995 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final|1995 European Cup Winners' Cup Final]]. [[Tony Barton (footballer)|Tony Barton]] was appointed manager of [[Aston Villa]] after the departure of [[Ron Saunders]] and led the club to win the 1982 [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] after only three months in charge. Club Director [[Trevor Brooking]] was appointed as caretaker manager of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] following [[Glenn Roeder]]'s illness at the end of the [[2002-03 in English football|2002–03 season]], then again following his dismissal early in the [[2003-04 in English football|2003–04 season]].

==Permanent appointments==
If a caretaker proves to be particularly successful during their spell in charge, they are sometimes given the manager's job permanently. [[Glenn Roeder]] was appointed permanent manager of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] after having taken over as caretaker following [[Graeme Souness]]' dismissal in 2006. This also occurred when [[Ricky Sbragia]] got the [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] job permanently after [[Roy Keane]]'s resignation in November 2008 but he resigned himself at the end of the season [[2008-09 in English football|2008–09]]. This also happened in the [[2010–11 Premier League]]; on 8 January 2011, [[Roy Hodgson]] was sacked by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] after a run of poor results, and with Liverpool languishing in 12th place, [[Kenny Dalglish]] was appointed the caretaker manager of Liverpool for the remainder of the season. After an impressive run of results, which saw Liverpool rise to 6th on the table, Dalglish was appointed the permanent manager of Liverpool, on a three-year contract.

In Norway, a notable example occurred in [[Norwegian Premier League 2006|2006]] when [[Rosenborg BK]] manager [[Per-Mathias Høgmo]] announced he was taking a leave of absence in mid-season, citing health concerns. At the time, Rosenborg were ten points behind leaders [[S.K. Brann|SK Brann]]. His assistant [[Knut Tørum]] was appointed on an interim basis, and proceeded to lead Rosenborg to a furious comeback, clinching the league title with one match to spare. Høgmo announced his resignation two days after Rosenborg clinched, and Tørum was named permanent manager after the season.

On the other hand, [[Tony Parkes]] was named caretaker manager of [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on six separate occasions between 1986 and 2004, without ever being given the role in a permanent capacity. He is still yet to be given a permanent managerial role.

==Notable success==
In November 2007, [[Sandy Stewart (footballer)|Sandy Stewart]] led [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]] to victory in the final of the [[Scottish Challenge Cup]] in his only game in charge as caretaker manager.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stjohnstonefc.co.uk/newsitem.asp?NewsID=2300 "Cup glory for Saints!!!"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720082530/http://www.stjohnstonefc.co.uk/newsitem.asp?NewsID=2300 |date=20 July 2011 }} St Johnstone FC Official website&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2007–08 Süper Lig|2007–08 season]], [[Cevat Güler]] won [[Süper Lig]] as [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]]'s caretaker manager. He was in charge for the last five matches of the season due to [[Karl Heinz Feldkamp]]'s resignation.

In the 2007 [[Hazfi Cup]] [[2007 Hazfi Cup Final|final]], [[Sepahan F.C.|Sepahan]]'s head coach, [[Luka Bonačić]] had travelled to his country, [[Croatia]] for personal reasons and was unavailable to manage the team in the second leg. [[Mansour Ebrahimzadeh]] who was assistant to Bonačić served as caretaker manager for that match. Sepahan won the match and the title.

[[Guus Hiddink]] was caretaker manager of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 2009, leading his team to the semi-final of the UEFA Champions League where they shut out [[FC Barcelona]] at [[Camp Nou]] and tied them back at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] (the latter being a very controversial game, the match official being [[Tom Henning Øvrebø]], with Chelsea eliminated on away goals), and finished off his tenure with the team as they won the [[FA Cup]] The club was reported happy to have Hiddink as manager even on a temporary basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/How-Guus-Hiddink-will-leave-incoming-Chelsea-boss-Carlo-Ancelotti-a-fine-legacy-article26669.html|title=Football News - all the latest breaking football stories - Mirror Online|author=|date=|website=www.mirrorfootball.co.uk|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129232039/http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/How-Guus-Hiddink-will-leave-incoming-Chelsea-boss-Carlo-Ancelotti-a-fine-legacy-article26669.html|archivedate=29 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roberto Di Matteo]] won the [[UEFA Champions League 2011–12|Champions League]] and [[2011-12 FA Cup|FA Cup]] as caretaker manager of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 2012, leading to him being appointed permanent manager on a two-year contract.

==History==

===1925–1933: Foundation and early years===
[[File:David Arellano.PNG|thumb|160px|left|[[David Arellano]], the founder of the club]]
[[File:Colo-Colo 1925.jpg|thumb|right|250px|One of the first Colo-Colo line-ups, 1925]]

The team was founded in early 1925 by [[C.D. Magallanes|Magallanes]]' footballer [[David Arellano]], who led a group of young players leaving that club after institutional problems.&lt;ref&gt;Salinas, Sebastián (2005), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salinas, Sebastián (2005), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, on 19 April, Arellano and the other youths officially established the institutions after meetings and negotiations, where Luis Contreras chose the name Colo-Colo for the club,&lt;ref&gt;Salinas, Sebastián (2005), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to the eponymous [[Mapuche]] cacique [[Colocolo (tribal chief)|Colo Colo]].

The team began to play friendly games, but in 1926, Colo-Colo took part in the [[Primera División de Chile|Metropolitan League of Honour]], where they were proclaimed champions (in unbeaten way) and earned the nickname of "invincible".&lt;ref&gt;Salinas, Sebastián (2005), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Colo-Colo became the first Chilean football team to participate in a tour across Europe. However, on 2 May, during an exhibition match against [[Real Valladolid|Real Unión Deportiva]] at [[Valladolid]], the team founder and captain David Arellano was critically injured after suffering a collision with an opposing player, which caused him [[peritonitis]].&lt;ref&gt;Salinas, Sebastián (2005), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The inflammation led him to his death the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Los Sports |date = 1925–1927 |url = http://www.memoriachilena.cl/archivos2/pdfs/MC0006536.pdf  |title = Los domingos footballísticos |work = Zig-Zag |accessdate = 17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the great impact caused by Arellano’s death, the club won the [[Chilean Primera División|Central League of football]] tournament – then renamed [[Asociación de Fútbol de Santiago|Asociación de Football de Santiago]] – in the 1928,&lt;ref&gt;Salinas, Sebastián (2005), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; 1929&lt;ref&gt;Salinas, Sebastián (2005), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1930&lt;ref&gt;Salinas, Sebastián (2005), p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; seasons.

In the 1931–32 season, Colo-Colo suffered its first institutional crisis due to financial problems, which led to a salary reduction for first team footballers and board members, with their consequent resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Salinas, Sebastián (2005), p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; That season the team played another tournament final against [[Audax Italiano]]. However, due to a platform collapse at Estadio Italiano and the subsequent bracas between the fans, it was decided the game suspension. In that moment, Colo-Colo were winning 2–1. That day's tragedy resulted in 130 injuries and three deaths.&lt;ref name="Tragedy"/&gt; The match was canceled and the champion position for that year remained vacant.&lt;ref name="Tragedy"&gt;Salinas, Sebastián (2005), pp. 299–300.&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors however declared that both [[Audax Italiano]] and Colo-Colo were declared champions.&lt;ref&gt;Larraín, Fernando (1940), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;La Nación (1985), pp. 12 and 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1933–1973: Beginnings in professional football===
In 1933, Colo-Colo alongside six clubs from [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]] decided to create the [[Chilean Primera División|Chilean professional football league]].&lt;ref name="Salinas, Sebastián 2005"&gt;Salinas, Sebastián (2005), p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 July, the team won the [[Campeonato de Apertura (Chile)|Campeonato de Apertura]] ([[Copa Chile]] precursor), after defeating 2–1 to [[Unión Española]].&lt;ref name="Salinas, Sebastián 2005"/&gt; However, in the first [[Chilean Primera División|Primera División]] official tournament, Colo-Colo finished first alongside [[C.D. Magallanes|Magallanes]], which forced the "Cacique" to play a tie-breaker match. That match was lost 2–1 by Colo-Colo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Eduardo | last= Espina |year= 2005 |url = http://rsssf.com/tablesc/chile33.html |title = Chile 1933 |work = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation ([[RSSSF]]) |accessdate = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 the team was undefeated,&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Edgardo (1988), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; and reached its first league title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Eduardo | last= Espina |year= 2005 |url = http://rsssf.com/tablesc/chile37.html |title = Chile 1937 |work = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation ([[RSSSF]]) |accessdate = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two seasons later, in 1939, Colo-Colo won for second time a league title, now under the guidance of the Hungarian coach [[Francisco Platko]],&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Edgardo (1988), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; and with [[Alfonso Domínguez]] as goalscorer with 20 goals in 24 matches.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Edgardo (1988), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; After another title in 1941 with Platko as coach,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Eduardo | last= Espina |year= 2005 |url = http://rsssf.com/tablesc/chile41.html |title = Chile 1941 |work = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation ([[RSSSF]]) |accessdate = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the club went on to win the titles of 1944&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Eduardo | last= Espina |year= 2005 |url = http://rsssf.com/tablesc/chile44.html |title = Chile 1944 |work = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation ([[RSSSF]]) |accessdate = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Eduardo | last= Espina |year= 2005 |url = http://rsssf.com/tablesc/chile47.html |title = Chile 1947 |work = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation ([[RSSSF]]) |accessdate = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Colo-Colo organized the [[South American Club Championship (football)|South American Club Championship]] – [[Copa Libertadores]] background – in Santiago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Esteban | last = Bekerman |year = 2008 |url = http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2008/03/13/noticia_0054.html |title = Hace 60 años, River perdía la gran chance de ser el primer club campeón de América |work = Perfil.com |accessdate = 10 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which brought together the 1947 continent’s champions. In 1945, the club had the worst season in its history, finishing penultimate in eleventh place only ahead of weak [[Badminton F.C.|Badminton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Eduardo | last= Espina |year= 2005 |url = http://rsssf.com/tablesc/chile45.html |title = Chile 1945 |work = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation ([[RSSSF]]) |accessdate = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s, club's president Antonio Labán hired [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] striker [[George Robledo]], paying [[£]]25,000 for its signing.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Edgardo y Salviat, Julio (1975), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Robledo’s performances led the team to the titles of 1953&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Eduardo | last= Espina |year= 2005 |url = http://rsssf.com/tablesc/chile53.html |title = Chile 1953 |work = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation ([[RSSSF]]) |accessdate = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Eduardo | last= Espina |year= 2005 |url = http://rsssf.com/tablesc/chile56.html |title = Chile 1956 |work = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation ([[RSSSF]]) |accessdate = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that age, the club acquired a terrain at [[Macul]], where began the construction of [[Estadio Monumental David Arellano|Estadio Monumental]].&lt;ref name="Marín 1975"&gt;Marín, Edgardo y Salviat, Julio (1975), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the acquisition, the directive invested in a headquarters located at [[Santiago Centro]] (located at Cienfuegos 41) in 1953.

In 1972, now under the orders of coach [[Luis Álamos]] &lt;ref&gt;Marín, Edgardo y Salviat, Julio (1975), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; and with figures like [[Carlos Caszely]] and [[Francisco Valdés]],&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Edgardo (1988), p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; the club won another championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Eduardo | last= Espina |year= 2005 |url = http://rsssf.com/tablesc/chile72.html |title = Chile 1972 |work = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation ([[RSSSF]]) |accessdate = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also obtained the country's attendance record of 45,929 people for a single season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= 2005 |url = http://rsssf.com/tablesc/chile72.html |title = Especial Colo Colo 1972 |work = Minuto 90 |accessdate = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That team was the basis of the so-called "Colo-Colo 73", the first Chilean team to reach a Copa Libertadores final, where it lost against [[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]] of Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Edgardo y Salviat, Julio (1975), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; After Colo-Colo's brilliant campaign, the club went into a competitiveness and institutional crisis not being able to win another league title until 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Eduardo | last= Espina |year= 2005 |url = http://rsssf.com/tablesc/chile79.html |title = Chile 1979 |work = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation ([[RSSSF]]) |accessdate = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; That team featured the talented Brazilian midfielder [[Severino Vasconcelos]] alongside a returning Caszely.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Edgardo (1988), p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in 1975, the construction of Estadio Monumental was finished and the stadium was inaugurated in a league match against [[Deportes Aviación]], but due to problems with the infrastructure and other basic services the stadium was indefinitely closed.

In the 1980s, the club obtained the league titles of 1981 and 1983&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Eduardo | last= Espina |year= 2005 |url = http://rsssf.com/tablesc/chile81.html |title = Chile 1981 |work = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation ([[RSSSF]]) |accessdate = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with coach [[Pedro García Barros|Pedro García]], and the 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Eduardo | last= Espina |year= 2005 |url = http://rsssf.com/tablesc/chile86.html |title = Chile 1986 |work = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation ([[RSSSF]]) |accessdate = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Eduardo | last= Espina |year= 2005 |url = http://rsssf.com/tablesc/chile89.html |title = Chile 1989 |work = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation ([[RSSSF]]) |accessdate = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; honours under [[Arturo Salah]]. The 1987 [[Alianza Lima air disaster]] claimed the lives of sixteen players and Colo-Colo was the first to help the Peruvian team, loaning them 4 players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = En Perú conmemoran 25 años de la tragedia área que enlutó a Alianza Lima | url = http://www.latercera.com/noticia/deportes/2012/12/656-497527-9-en-peru-conmemoran-25-anos-de-la-tragedia-aerea-que-enluto-a-alianza-lima.shtml | publisher = La Tercera |date=8 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless the team won four Copa Chile titles in that decade. During that period, the greatest disappointment was at the continental tournament level with the team only exceeding the first stage in the [[1988 Copa Libertadores]]. On September 30, 1989, the Estadio Monumental was re-inaugurated in an exhibition match against [[CA Peñarol|Peñarol]], which Colo-Colo won 2–1&lt;ref name="ianu"/&gt; with goals by [[Marcelo Barticciotto]] and [[Leonel Herrera Silva|Leonel Herrera]], the son of a 1970s legendary former defender of the same name.

=== 1991–1999: International success ===
[[File:Camiseta Colo-Colo 91.jpg|190px|thumbnail|Colo-Colo's uniform at the [[1991 Copa Libertadores Finals]]]]
The 1990s was the most successful decade in the club's history for the national and international honours achieved. Croatian [[Mirko Jozić]] arrived as coach, leading the team towards its first ''Bicampeonato'' for winning two national titles in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Eduardo | last= Espina |year= 2005 |url = http://rsssf.com/tablesc/chile90.html |title = Chile 1990 |work = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation ([[RSSSF]]) |accessdate = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 5, 1991, after beating [[Club Olimpia|Olimpia]] 3–0 at Monumental with two goals by [[Luis Pérez (Chilean footballer)|Luis Pérez]] and one by [[Leonel Herrera Silva|Leonel Herrera]], Colo-Colo became the first Chilean team to win a [[Copa Libertadores 1991|Copa Libertadores]]. That same season, the "Albos" lost the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] final against Yugoslavian club [[Red Star Belgrade]], after being defeated 3–0 in Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date = 23 October 2008 |url = http://www.dalealbo.cl/copa-intercontinental-1991-estrella-roja-3-0-colo- |title = Copa Intercontinental 1991: Estrella Roja 3–0 Colo Colo |work = Dalealbo.cl |accessdate = 23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the local level, the club won the 1991 league, its third-consecutive title thus achieving its first ''Tricampeonato''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Eduardo | last= Espina |year= 2005 |url = http://rsssf.com/tablesc/chile91.html |title = Chile 1991 |work = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation ([[RSSSF]]) |accessdate = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, the club won the [[1992 Recopa Sudamericana|Recopa Sudamericana]], after beating Brazil's [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube|Cruzeiro]] in a penalty shootout, and also obtained the [[1992 Copa Interamericana|Copa Interamericana]], after winning 3–1 against [[Puebla FC|Puebla]] in Mexico. The last title won by Jozić in Colo-Colo was the 1993 league title, thus closing a successful spell in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Eduardo | last= Espina |year= 2005 |url = http://rsssf.com/tablesc/chile93.html |title = Chile 1993 |work = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation ([[RSSSF]]) |accessdate = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Jozić's departure came a little drought in national titles, but the team managed to get an unforgettable 3-0 win over arch rivals Universidad de Chile in 1995. The team was champion of the 1994 [[Copa Chile 1994|Copa Chile]] and reached the 1994 [[1994 Copa Libertadores|Copa Libertadores]] quarterfinals. The following season saw the arrival of Paraguayan coach [[Gustavo Benítez]], who obtained the 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Eduardo | last= Espina |year= 2005 |url = http://rsssf.com/tablesc/chile96.html |title = Chile 1996 |work = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation ([[RSSSF]]) |accessdate = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1997-C&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Eduardo | last= Espina |year= 2005 |url = http://rsssf.com/tablesc/chile97.html |title = Chile 1997 |work = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation ([[RSSSF]]) |accessdate = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Eduardo | last= Espina |year= 2005 |url = http://rsssf.com/tablesc/chile98.html |title = Chile 1998 |work = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation ([[RSSSF]]) |accessdate = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; league titles. The team advanced to the semifinals of the [[Supercopa Libertadores]] in [[1996 Supercopa Libertadores|1996]], and of the Copa Libertadores in [[1997 Copa Libertadores|1997]], being eliminated both times by Cruzeiro. In 1999, Colo-Colo relived something like 1994, finishing fourth in the Chilean league and having three coaches during that single season: Brazilian [[Nelsinho Baptista]], the caretaker manager Carlos Durán and then [[Fernando Morena]] of Uruguay, who remained until 2001.

=== 1999–present: Bankruptcy and recovery ===
In 1999, after Benítez's departure, the club entered a serious financial crisis. In 23 January 2002, after years of economic mismanagement under the leadership of Peter Dragicevic as president,&lt;ref name="Levanta de Quiebra"&gt;{{cite web |first= Pedro Pablo | last= Vivanco del Río |url = http://www.todoalbo.cl/el-club/historia/ |title = Historia de Colo-Colo en Internet |work = Todoalbo.cl |accessdate = 23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the club was declared bankrupt. Justice named Juan Carlos Saffie as syndic responsible for the institution allowing it not to lose its legal status.&lt;ref name="Levanta de Quiebra"/&gt; Despite the bankruptcy, under [[Jaime Pizarro]] as coach – key player in the obtaining of the [[1991 Copa Libertadores]] – Los Albos won the [[2002 Chilean Primera División season|Torneo de Clausura]], with an almost completely juvenile squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Eduardo | last= Espina |year= 2005 |url = http://rsssf.com/tablesc/chile02.html |title = Chile 2002 |work = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation ([[RSSSF]]) |accessdate = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, in 2005, the joint-stock company Blanco y Negro&lt;ref name = "salah"&gt;{{cite web |author = Sitio Oficial de Colo-Colo |year = 2013 |url = http://www.colocolo.cl/arturo-salah-asumio-como-nuevo-presidente-de-colo-colo/  |title = Información Corporativa Club Social y Deportivo Colo Colo 2013  |language = |accessdate = 25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; took over the administration, concessioning all club assets for thirty years in exchange for paying all debts through an opening process at the [[Santiago Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name="Levanta de Quiebra"/&gt; In the first half of 2006, the judiciary court declared the bankruptcy over.&lt;ref name="Levanta de Quiebra"/&gt;

[[File:Colo Colo Campeón 2006.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Colo-Colo squad celebrating the [[Chilean Primera División|2006 Torneo de Clausura]] obtaining.]]
With the Argentine [[Claudio Borghi]] as coach since 2006, and with players like [[Matías Fernández]] and [[Humberto Suazo]], Colo-Colo obtained a ''Bicampeonato'' winning the [[Chilean Apertura Tournament|Apertura]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date= 21 February 2008 |url = http://papeldigital.info/ltdep/edicion.html?20060703010022 | title = Bravo por el eterno campeón | work= Papel Digital}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chilean Primera División|Clausura]] tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date= 20 February 2008 |url = http://papeldigital.info/ltdep/edicion.html?20061225010022 | title = Festejo entre copas | work= Papel Digital}}&lt;/ref&gt; The squad reached another international final, the [[2006 Copa Sudamericana|Copa Sudamericana]], losing 2–1 to Mexico's side [[CF Pachuca|Pachuca]]. That season, ''El Cacique'' was recognized by the [[IFFHS]] as the world's club of the month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date= 20 October 2006 |url = http://www.iffhs.de/?3d4d443d0b803e8b447cce02285fdcdc3bfcdc0aec70aeedbc08 | title = The world's club of the month | publisher = [[IFFHS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season Colo-Colo won two more consecutive tournaments, winning a ''Tetracampeonato'' for winning four back-to-back championships, being the first Chilean team to achieve that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://papeldigital.info/ltdep/edicion.html?20071224010022 |title = Blanca Navidad | publisher = La Tercera |accessdate = 20 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Borghi's departure, the club obtained its 28th title after defeating [[CD Palestino|Palestino]] in the [[Torneo de Clausura de Chile 2008|2008 Torneo de Clausura]] finals under the coaching of [[Marcelo Barticciotto]], and with [[Lucas Barrios]] as principal scorer, who equaled Luis Hernán Álvarez's record of highest number of goals scored by a Colo-Colo footballer during a single season with 37 goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.terra.cl/deportes/index.cfm?accion=futbolnacional&amp;id_reg=1090066&amp;XjWpZ=PqZ23&amp;titulo_url=%A1Colo_Colo_campeon!_Logro_su_estrella_28_con_historico_goleador |title = ¡Colo Colo campeón! Logró su estrella 28 con histórico goleador | publisher = La Tercera |date = 20 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, the club became the first professional team to play on [[Easter Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://es.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=1086835.html |title = Juego del siglo en Rapa Nui | publisher = [[FIFA.com]] |date = 6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a poor [[Torneo de Apertura de Chile 2009|Torneo de Apertura 2009]] – not reaching the play-offs for the first time – Los Albos started the Clausura very close to relegation positions. However, the team reached the tournament's finals against Universidad Católica, beating them 4–2 in [[Estadio Santa Laura-Universidad SEK|Santa Laura]], with players like [[Esteban Paredes]], [[Macnelly Torres]] and [[Ezequiel Miralles]], coached by [[Hugo Tocalli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.emol.com/noticias/deportes/detalle/detallenoticias.asp?idnoticia=387952 |title = No hay caso con Colo-Colo de amenazado con el descenso a campeón | publisher = Emol.com |date = 9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colo-Colo's last championship was in 2014 after winning the [[2013–14 Campeonato Nacional season|Torneo de Clausura]]. It was the team's 30th Chilean League title.

==Badge, colours and kit==
[[File:Cacique Colo-Colo.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Colocolo (tribal chief)|Colocolo]] bust at [[Estadio Monumental David Arellano]]]]
{{Details|Uniform of Colo-Colo|Badge of Colo-Colo}}
The club's badge represents [[Mapuche]] chieftain [[Colocolo (tribal chief)|Colo Colo]], an important Wall Mapu member who battled in the [[Arauco War]] against the [[Spanish empire]] (1536–1818).&lt;ref name="Colocolo"&gt;{{cite web |date = 19 April 2012 |url = http://www.elamaule.cl/noticia/deporte/87anoscolocolo-conoce-quien-fue-el-cacique-colo-colo |title = Historia del mapuche Colocolo |publisher = El Maule |accessdate = 10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 April 1925, when the club was established, Luis Contreras – one of the players that founded the club – defined the team's badge, in representation of the chief and the country's indigenous people.

Throughout its history, Colo-Colo’s uniform has been a white shirt and black shorts. The uniform was originally designed by Juan Quiñones following the recommendations of [[David Arellano]].

In 1927, after Arellano’s died while playing against Real Unión Deportiva (currently [[Real Valladolid]]), it was decided then that the badge will wear a black horizontal band over it forever, to represent the institution's eternal mourning.

The team’s away kits have varied through its history, from green between 1927 and the mid-1970s and to red from 1975 to 1988.

Colo-Colo initially played on a field called Estadio El Llano but in January 1928 moved to the [[Estadio Campos de Sports de Ñuñoa|Campos de Sports de Ñuñoa]]. The team later moved to [[Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez|Estadio Nacional]] where it played from 1939 to the late 1980s. In 1946 the club bought a stadium from [[Carabineros de Chile]] – then called ''Fortín Mapocho'' – which was closed according security reasons. It was intended to build a 30,000 seat stadium at the site. However, a municipal ordinance prohibited construction in the area. For that reason, Colo-Colo sold the stadium in order to raise funds for the future [[Estadio Monumental David Arellano|Estadio Monumental]].

In 1956, club's president Antonio Labán acquired a 28&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] terrain at [[Macul]], close to the intersection between [[Vicuña Mackenna Avenue|Vicuña Mackenna]] and Departamental. The new stadium was originally planned with a capacity of 120,000. Due to the work's high cost and lack of a government subsidy the project was halted. In 1960, after Chile's successful proposition to hold the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], several congressmen proposed to build a 52,000-seat stadium at Colo-Colo's site. However, the [[1960 Valdivia earthquake|9.5 Valdivia earthquake]] and a willingness from congress stopped the initiative.

Colo-Colo's brilliant campaigns in 1972 and 1973 allowed the stadium construction to resume. It was inaugurated in a league match 1975 which Colo-Colo win 1–0 over [[Deportes Aviación]] with [[Juan Carlos Orellana]], who become the first player to score a goal in Monumental's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.colocolo.cl/estadio-monumental/monumental/historia/ |title = Una historia monumental |publisher= Colocolo.cl |accessdate = 13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the stadium was closed due to lack of basic services and infrastructure. It was not reopened until 1989 thanks to [[Hugo Rubio]]'s transfer to [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]] which allowed the club to receive [[US$]]1 million to repair the problems mentioned. The stadium was called ''Monumental [[David Arellano]]'' in honour of its founder and its definitive inauguration was in a match against Uruguay's [[CA Peñarol|Peñarol]] which Colo-Colo won 2–1.&lt;ref name="ianu"/&gt;

Since its definitive opening, the stadium has seen the [[1991 Copa Libertadores]] and [[1992 Copa Interamericana]] titles as well as several league honors.

Monumental's public record attendance was in 1992 for a derby match with [[Club Universidad de Chile|Universidad de Chile]] which registered an attendance of 70,000 fans approximately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional de Chile |year= 1994 |url = http://www.bcn.cl/obtienearchivo?id=recursoslegales/10221.3/22919/1/HL19327.pdf |title = Historia de la Ley Nº 19.327.

==Supporters and rivalries==
{{Main article|Garra Blanca}}
Colo-Colo is the club with the largest following in Chile, with approximately 42% of the total [[Football in Chile|Chilean football]] fans according to research published in August 2012 by Spanish newspaper agency [[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.marca.com/2012/07/23/futbol/futbol_internacional/chile/1343054579.html | title = Chile es del 'Colo' aunque gane la 'U' | publisher = [[Marca.com]] |date = 23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study showed a 4% growth in comparison to 2006 research by Fundación Futuro that ranked the club in first place with the 38% of the preferences, leaving its rival Universidad de Chile in second place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fundacionfuturo.cl/admin/publicos/Mundial.pdf | title = Mundial | work = Fundación Futuro |date = 31 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 1960s, the club has had organized fan groups, which evolved in the mid-1980s into the so-called ''[[Garra Blanca]]''. They attended Colo-Colo's games and generally rioted, especially in derbies, turning [[Estadio Monumental David Arellano|Estadio Monumental]] surroundings into battlefields against the [[Carabineros de Chile|military police]]. In 2000, the group was declared as [[Barra brava]].

The convocation center is unique among Illinois university athletic projects, because Chicago State University did not have to raise any money for the project.  The money was allocated from the State of Illinois treasury by then Senate President [[Emil Jones]].

The venue hosted the [[2012 Great West Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|2012]] and [[2013 Great West Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|2013]] [[Great West Conference Men's Basketball Tournament]].

'''Energy Brands''', also [[doing business as]] '''Glacéau''', is a privately owned subsidiary of [[The Coca-Cola Company]] based in [[Whitestone, Queens|Whitestone]], [[Queens, New York]] that manufactures and distributes various lines of [[enhanced water]]. Founded in May 1996 by [[J. Darius Bikoff]] with an [[electrolyte]] enhanced line of water called Smartwater, Energy Brands initially distributed its products to health food stores and independent retailers in the New York area. Adding Fruitwater and Vitaminwater to its line in 1998 and 2000, respectively, the company expanded to nationwide distribution in the early 2000s.

By 2002, the Glacéau line of waters were the top selling enhanced water brand in the United States, with the company's Vitaminwater being its best selling product. In 2006, the company earned US$350 million in revenues. The company then began its global expansion, launching its products in the United Kingdom and Australia in 2008, France in 2009 and Argentina in 2011.

Energy Brands is owned primarily by Bikoff, employees, and small investors. Rapper [[50 Cent]] obtained a minority  share of the company as part of an endorsement deal in the company. 30% of the equity was sold to [[LVMH]] sometime in the 2000s, which in turn sold those shares. The shares eventually were sold to India-based [[Tata Group]] in August 2006, which held the shares until May 2007 when The Coca-Cola Company purchased the company as an independent subsidiary, leaving its actual operations with its existing management including Bikoff.

==History==
[[J. Darius Bikoff]], a self-proclaimed [[health nut]] born on September 21, 1961, first conceived of the idea of vitamin enhanced water in 1996. According to him, he was feeling "run down" and concerned he was catching a cold, so he took some [[Vitamin C]] and drank some [[mineral water]]. As he consumed the items, he started thinking about the idea of having them together instead of having to take them separately.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/movers_and_shakers/article3997802.ece |title=Coke's water man J Darius Bikoff gushes forth |first=Andrew |last=Davidson |work=[[The Times|Times Online]], UK Edition |publisher=[[Times Newspapers]] |date=May 28, 2008 |accessdate=2009-01-16  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYDaily"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/money/2001/04/23/2001-04-23_high-energy_formula_for_succ.html |title=High-Energy Formula for Successful Biz |first=Nancy |last=Dillon |work=[[New York Daily News]] |date=April 23, 2001 |accessdate=January 17, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721012720/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/money/2001/04/23/2001-04-23_high-energy_formula_for_succ.html |archivedate=July 21, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded Energy Brands in May 1996 using his personal savings and contracting with an [[aquifer]] in Connecticut for the base water used.&lt;ref name="NYDaily" /&gt; The individual products carried the Glacéau name, with the company's first product being Glacéau Smartwater.&lt;ref name="portfoliomanagement"&gt;{{cite book |title=Value Innovation Portfolio Management |first=Sheila |last=Mello |author2=Wayne Mackey |author3=Ronald Lasser |author4=Richard Tait  |publisher=[[J. Ross Publishing]] |year=2006 |isbn=1-932159-57-6 |page=186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting on the company's early history, Bikoff notes that it was "very tough" as he struggled with founding the company having no actual experience in beverage manufacturing, beyond working in an [[aluminum]] [[fabrication (metal)|fabrication]] factory.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="portfoliomanagement" /&gt; While launching his company, he was also having to deal with personal struggles including a [[divorce]] and having to file for [[bankruptcy]].&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; He started by personally introducing Smartwater to smaller independent [[natural food]] stores around New York, moving to a statewide launch when the product became successful. He used this same basic method, adding in "[[Small business|mom-and-pop stores]]", for the launches of Fruitwater and Vitaminwater in 1998 and 2000, respectively.&lt;ref name="portfoliomanagement" /&gt;  By 2001, the company's drinks were sold in over 4,000 retail stores in the New York area.&lt;ref name="NYDaily" /&gt; According to Bikoff, this enabled his products to go unnoticed by the large beverage makers until the product was firmly established when he could then cultivate relationships with various independent distributors opening the way for nationwide distribution.&lt;ref name="portfoliomanagement" /&gt;

Bikoff eventually allowed [[LVMH]] to buy a 30% equity share in the company. LVMH later sold the stake to another investor, who in turn sold it again.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; The shares ended up in the hands of India-based [[Tata Tea Limited|Tata Group]] in August 2006, which paid [[United States dollar|$]]677 million for the 30% equity, seeking to expand its American business interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolpda/ifs_news/hi/newsid_5279000/5279412.stm |title=Tata taps into US bottled water |publisher=[[BBC]] News |date=August 23, 2006 |accessdate=January 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coca-Cola acquisition===
On May 25, 2007, the company was acquired by [[The Coca-Cola Company]] for $4.1 billion in cash.&lt;ref name="coca-cola20070525"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/presscenter/nr_20070525_glaceau_acquisition.html |title=The Coca-Cola Company Press Release of May 25, 2007 |accessdate=2012-02-16 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527093522/http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/presscenter/nr_20070525_glaceau_acquisition.html |archivedate=May 27, 2007 |df= }} retrieved from archive.org&lt;/ref&gt;

$1.2 billion of the sales went to the Tata Group for its 30% minority ownership, which Tata agreed to sell.&lt;ref name="TS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10359367/1/coke-deal-was-pricey-but-right.html |title=Coke Deal Was Pricey But Right |first=Debra |last=Borchardt |work=[[TheStreet]] |date=May 29, 2007 |accessdate=January 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2007/05/26/stories/2007052605230100.htm |title=Tata Tea makes $523-m profit with Glaceau sale |work=[[The Hindu Business Line]] |date=May 26, 2007 |accessdate=January 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the purchase agreement, Energy Brands remains nearly [[autonomous]] as a subsidiary of Coca-Cola, with Coca-Cola primarily operating with a hands off method, leaving Bikoff and Energy Brands principal operating officers in charge. In discussing the role of Coca-Cola, Bikoff states: "We run independently, we have our own offices. If Coca-Cola don't call me, I don't call them."&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;

In 2008, Energy Brands began launching its products in the United Kingdom and Australia in 2008, with France following in 2009 and Argentina in 2011. The company eventually plans to expand to Canada and Mexico.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;

===Legal disputes===
On April 5, 2006, Energy Brands filed a lawsuit against [[PepsiCo]] in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan alleging that PepsiCo's [[SoBe]] "Life Water" packages infringed its [[trade dress]] for similar drinks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nutrisuplaw.com/docs/lifewater.pdf|title=Schneider Rothman IP Law Group|date=16 May 2015|work=nutrisuplaw.com|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the subsequent settlement Pepsi agreed to change its packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bevnet.com/news/2006/05-03-2006-glaceau_update.asp|title=Judge, Skeptical of Pepsi's Motives, Urges Label Change in Life Water Suit|work=BevNET.com|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bevnet.com/news/2006/05-05-2006-Glaceau_Pepsico.asp|title=Life Water Packaging to Change|work=BevNET.com|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, 2009, the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] filed a class-action lawsuit against Energy Brands' parent company in the Northern District of California Court. The suit alleges that the marketing of the drink as a "healthful alternative" to soda is deceptive and in violation of [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] guidelines. The consumer group states that "according to CSPI nutritionists, the 33 grams of sugar in each bottle of Vitaminwater do more to promote obesity, diabetes and other health problems than the vitamins in the drinks do to perform the advertised benefits listed on the bottles". Coca-Cola dismissed the allegations as "ridiculous," on the grounds that "no consumer could reasonably be misled into thinking Vitaminwater was a healthy beverage" and an attempt by the group to increase its readership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSTRE50E54L20090115 |title=U.S. group sues Coke over VitaminWater health claims |publisher=[[Reuters]] |first1=Martinne |last1=Geller |first2=Lisa |last2=Richwine |date=January 15, 2009 |accessdate=May 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-robbins/the-dark-side-of-vitaminw_b_669716.html?ref=fb&amp;src=sp |title=The Dark Side of Vitaminwater |publisher=[[Huffington Post]] |first1=John |last1=Robbins |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation]] ordered the coordination of different lawsuits against Coca-Cola Co. that alleged it misled the public about the nutritional benefits of Vitaminwater.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masstortdefense.com/2011/02/articles/panel-creates-vitaminwater-mdl/ Panel Creates Vitaminwater MDL] MassTortDefense. February 14, 2011. Retrieved July 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==

===Financials===
As a privately owned company, Energy Brands has never been required to release information about its sales figures or other financial information. Bikoff himself never stated what percentage of the company he owned before it was sold. ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine once reported that he owned only 25% of the company, but in an interview with ''[[The Times]]'', he denied this stating: "Did anyone say I had less than 50%?

But I don’t talk about my share as every story becomes one about personal wealth."&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; In 2006, the company was reported to have an annual sales revenue of $350 million.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="portfoliomanagement" /&gt;

Before the sale to Coca-Cola, 70% shares of the company were held by company employees and smaller investors, with 30% held by the Tata Group.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; In October 2004, rapper Curtis Jackson—known as [[50 Cent]]—was given a minority share in the company in exchange for becoming a spokesperson after learning that he was a fan of the beverage. The health conscious Jackson noted that he first learned of the product while at a gym in [[Los Angeles]], and stated that "they do such a good job making water taste good." After becoming a shareholder and endorser, Jackson worked with the company to create a new grape-flavored "Formula 50" variant of VitaminWater and mentioned the drinks in various songs and interviews. It's unknown how much Jackson made from the purchase of his shares by Coca-cola, with estimates in the financial press mainly in the $100 – 400million range. Though he no longer has an equity stake in the company, Jackson continues to act as a spokesperson for Vitaminwater, enthusiastically supporting the product including singing about it at the [[BET Awards]] and expressing his excitement over the company's continuing to allow his input on products.&lt;ref name="USAToday"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/adtrack/2007-07-29-vitamin-water-50-cent_N.htm |title=50 Cent, Glaceau forge unique bond |first=Theresa |last=Howard |work=[[USA Today]] |date=July 29, 2007 |accessdate=January 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Products===
Energy Brands' first product was Glacéau Smartwater, [[distilled|vapor-distilled]] water with added [[electrolytes]], which was released at the company's launch in 1996.&lt;ref name="NYDaily" /&gt;&lt;ref name="portfoliomanagement" /&gt; Glaceau Fruitwater, adding zero-calorie fruit flavors to the core Smartwater, followed in 1998. In 2000, Vitaminwater was launched, adding vitamins and [[natural flavor]]s with Smartwater.&lt;ref name="NYDaily" /&gt;&lt;ref name="portfoliomanagement" /&gt; Designed to "fill the gap" between [[soft drinks]] and [[water]] for people who knew they should be drinking more water but weren't, Vitaminwater was targeted primarily at adults. With fewer calories than soda, the company states that the drink both hydrates consumers and provides nutrients they are likely to be missing.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;

In 2002, Energy Brands' Glacéau drinks were the top selling brand of enhanced water.&lt;ref name="Strategy"&gt;{{cite book |title=Strategy: Winning in the Marketplace : Core Concepts, Analytical Tools, Cases |first=Arthur A |last=Thompson, |author2=John Gamble |author3=A J Strickland  |publisher=Tsinghua University Press, [[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw Hill]] |chapter=Case 5: Competition in the Bottled Water Industry |page=C-11 |year=2004 |isbn=7-302-09335-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitaminwater is considered its most successful of the four products.&lt;ref name="NYDaily" /&gt;&lt;ref name="portfoliomanagement" /&gt; On April 2, 2009, Glacéau Vitaminwater introduced a new line for the weight-conscious market called Vitaminwater10 that has 10 calories per eight-ounce serving,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Elliott |first=Stuart | title = With Humor, Glacéau Vitaminwater Introduces New Low-Calorie Beverage | date = March 31, 2009 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/01/business/media/01adco.html?ref=business |accessdate=April 5, 2009 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later Vitaminwater Zero, a calorie-free drink, down from the older line that serves 50 kilocalories. Both drinks include [[Truvia]] as a sweetener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=The Number Three Sugar Substitute Truvia Natural Zero-Calorie Sweetner is Now Available in Spoonable Packaging |url=http://www.truvia.com/wcm/groups/public/@truvia/documents/document/na3029698.pdf |date=May 25, 2010 |publisher=[[Truvia]] |accessdate=May 31, 2010 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717105920/http://www.truvia.com/wcm/groups/public/%40truvia/documents/document/na3029698.pdf |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitaminwater Zero also uses [[Erythritol]]. In September 2010, a rebranded version of the 10 calorie drink was introduced to the Canadian market, although Vitaminwater Zero is still exclusively a US product.

VitaminWater is a mineral water product distributed by Energy Brands and was introduced in 2000. Some ingredients are added according to the flavor and intended purpose of the drink.

==='Shonky' award===
In 2008, the Australian consumer organisation [[Choice (Australian consumer organisation)|Choice]] gave one of its annual '[[Shonky]]' awards to VitaminWater, saying that, despite the claim that the drinks were healthy, "one bottle contains about a third of the recommended daily sugar intake for an average adult woman ... and none contains more than 1% fruit juice".  Choice also noted that the label on one flavour blatantly mocked food regulations designed to protect consumers by stating, "We are prohibited from making exaggerated claims about the potency of the nutrients in this bottle", before making exaggerated claims about the potency of the nutrients in the bottle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glaceau Vitamin Water|url=http://classic.choice.com.au/shonkyaward/hall-of-shame/shonkys-2008/shonky-2008-glaceau-vitamin-water.aspx|publisher=Choice|accessdate=13 August 2015}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misleading advertising===
In January 2011, the United Kingdom's [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) ruled that a Summer 2010 advertisement that claimed VitaminWater was "nutritious" was misleading due to the high sugar content (23&amp;nbsp;g per 500&amp;nbsp;ml) of the drink.  The ruling banning the advertisement stated: "Because Vitamin Water contained about a quarter of a consumer's GDA (guideline daily amount) for sugar as well as the added vitamins, we considered that the description of Vitamin Water as 'nutritious' was misleading".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12218673|title=Advert for Coca-Cola Vitamin Water 'misled public'|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hajo Seppelt''' (born 1963 in [[Berlin]]) is a [[Germans|German]] [[journalist]] and [[author]].

== Personal life and education ==
Seppelt is the son of Alfred Seppelt, who was the head of the Berlin Chess Federation from 1984 to 2004.

In 1981, he obtained his college preparatory degree ([[Abitur]]) at the [[:de:Beethoven-Oberschule|Beethoven High School (Berlin)]] in Berlin's Lankwitz neighborhood. He studied sports, social studies, journalism and French at the [[Free University of Berlin]] for a few semesters but did not complete a degree.

== Career ==
Since 1985, Seppelt has worked as a sports reporter for Germany's premier public broadcaster [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]. He has also worked for the Berlin public broadcaster [[Sender Freies Berlin]] and its 2003 successor [[Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg]]. After working for many years as a live commentary for swimming events for ARD, he was stripped of this duty in the early summer of 2006. Seppelt said that this was in reaction to a private email, in which he criticized ARD's uncritical reporting on doping, becoming public. Since 2006, he has worked as a freelance journalist for ARD and has made a number of reports and documentary films about doping.

=== Doping in Germany ===
{{see also|Doping in East Germany}}
Together with former Canadian swimmer [[Karin Helmstaedt]], Seppelt made the documentary film ''Staatsgeheimnis Kinderdoping'' (State Secret Child Doping) about the perpetrators and victims of doping in [[East Germany|East German]] swimming. It was broadcast by ARD. Together with Holger Schück, he published the book ''Anklage: Kinderdoping. Das Erbe des DDR-Sports'' (Indictment Doping: The Legacy of East German Sports) in 1999. It also dealt with the topic of [[Doping in East Germany|state doping]] in Communist East Germany.

In 2006, Seppelt reported extensively about the doping problem in [[Cycle sport|cycling]]. Among other things, his research led to the identification of the German physician Markus China as a member of the doping network organized by Spanish doctor [[Eufemiano Fuentes]].&lt;ref&gt;RBB Online, [http://www.rbb-online.de/unternehmen/presse/presseinformationen/2006/nach_ard_informationen.html Nach ARD-Informationen Deutscher Komplize des spanischen Dopingnetzwerkes identifiziert]&lt;/ref&gt; In November of that year, he was awarded the ''Leuchtturm für besondere publizistische Leistungen'' (''Lighthouse Prize for Special Journalist Achievement'') by the journalists’ association Netzwerk Recherche for his research, reports and exclusive revelations about cyclists [[Jan Ullrich]] and [[Floyd Landis]] and [[Eufemiano Fuentes]].&lt;ref&gt;RBB Online, [http://www.rbb-online.de/unternehmen/presse/presseinformationen/2006/journalistenpreis.html Journalistenpreis für RBB-Sport reporter Hajo Seppelt]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the documentary “Mission: Clean Sport“ Hajo Seppelt and Jo Goll documented the work of German doping control officers. The film highlighted flaws in Germany's doping-control system and caused heady public discussions, which contributed to structural changes in Germany's National Anti Doping Agency (NADA). The report won the ''Silver Chest Award 2007'' at the International Television Film Festival in [[Plovdiv]] and the international ''Sports Movie and TV Award 2007'' in [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;inside-digital.de, {{cite web |url=http://www.inside-digital.de/news/7201.html |title=Seppelt und Goll erhalten zweiten internationalen TV-Preis |accessdate=2015-03-22 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702035637/http://www.inside-digital.de/news/7201.html |archivedate=July 2, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was also nominated for the ''German Television Prize'' and the ''[[Prix Europa]]''.

In mid-January the German Skiing Association (DSV) took legal action, and a Hamburg court issued an injunction against Seppelt for refusing to make a [[Cease and desist|cease-and-desist declaration]] demanded by the DSV about suspicions that German [[Cross-country skiing|cross-country skiers]] and [[Biathlon|biathletes]] had engaged in [[blood doping]] in a Vienna laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;FOCUS Online, [http://www.focus.de/sport/doping/doping_aid_233550.html Deutsche in Wiener Blutbank] (16. Januar 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; A superior court in Hamburg overturned that ruling in Seppelt's favor, concluding that DSV had no right to demand the cease-and-desist declaration because it was not affected by the journalist's reporting. The ruling was based constitutional guarantees of journalist freedom in cases of anonymous sources. The judgement also overturned an injunction from October 21, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;taz, [http://www.taz.de/1/leben/medien/artikel/1/das-klima-ist-rauer/ Das Klima ist rauer] (1. Dezember 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Seppelt's suspicion could not be proved after extensive investigations.

In January 2012 Seppelt and colleagues from the Western German public broadcaster [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] had reports featured on ARD and WDR sports programs about the blood of thirty athletes being exposed to ultra-violet radiation by a sports doctor in the Eastern German city of Erfurt. Several of the athletes concerned were named. In the wake of the broadcasts, a discussion arose as to whether such procedures were banned according to the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) code. WADA itself considered them to be.&lt;ref&gt;Hajo Seppelt: ''[http://www.sportschau.de/doping/interviewhowman100.html Interview mit NADA-Generaldirektor David Howman – Erneuter Kurswechsel der WADA im Fall Erfurt?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607233756/http://www.sportschau.de/doping/interviewhowman100.html |date=2012-06-07 }}'', in: Sportschau.de, 4. Juni 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-doping investigations of the athletes ended up with discontinuations and acquittals due to extenuating circumstances, and a criminal investigation of the doctor concerned was also discontinued. Nonetheless, many experts declared that blood treatments were banned in principle by the laws governing sports. The doctor tried to get a superior court in Cologne to issue an injunction against WDR,&lt;ref&gt;sid: ''[http://www.focus.de/sport/mehrsport/allgemein-doping-erfurter-arzt-erwirkt-einstweilige-verfuegung_aid_719469.html Erfurter Arzt erwirkt einstweilige Verfügung]'', in Focus.de, 1. März 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but the broadcaster won out, and the report was allowed to contain references to “forbidden blood treatments.”&lt;ref&gt;sid: ''[http://www.focus.de/sport/mehrsport/allgemein-doping-erfurter-doping-affaere-wdr-siegt-vor-olg_aid_869665.html Erfurter Doping-Affäre: WDR siegt vor OLG]'', in: Focus.de, 27. November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Doping in China ===
Parallel with the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], ARD broadcast the 45-minute-documentary ''Olympia im Reich der Mittel: Doping in China'' (''Flying High in the Middle Kingdom: Doping in China''), which Seppelt made with Jo Goll. The film reported about doping and doping controls in China, in particularly above proven case of [[stem-cell]] manipulation carried out on top athletes.&lt;ref&gt;DOKfilm, [http://www.dokfilm.de/index.php?article_id=123, Olympia im Reich der Mittel]&lt;/ref&gt; At the International New York Film Festival, it won a world gold medal for long-form reporting. It was also awarded the main prize at 2009 Sportfilm Liberec 2007 - World Facts Challenge festival.&lt;ref&gt;NDR, [http://www.ndr.de/unternehmen/presse/pressemitteilungen/pressemeldungndr4514.html Auszeichnung Sportfilm Liberec 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Doping in Kenya ===
In the spring and summer of 2012, Seppelt and Kempe reported for the first time about doping among Kenyan track-and-field athletes. The focus was primarily on practices among doctors in the background. One athlete told of widespread doping among Kenyan long-distance runners.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://olympia.ard.de/london2012/allemeldungen/kenia167.html Topläufer aus Kenia gesteht in der ARD Doping]'', in: ARD.de, 6. August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://olympia.ard.de/london2012/allemeldungen/kenia169.html Kenianer Kisorio nennt weitere Doping-Details]'', in: ARD.de, 8. August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The reports caused intense reactions in Kenya and met with considerable international resonance. As a result, doping controls were stepped up in the country.

The documentary ''Doping - Top Secret: The Shadowy World of Athletics'' shows that it is relatively easy to obtain banned performance-enhancing drugs in Kenya. It traces the story of an impoverished young runner who seems to have died from the side effects of taking EPO.

Kenyan athletics authorities refused to speak with Seppelt about the issue, and his film presents circumstantial evidence of corruption among Kenyan sports functionaries. Former Boston marathon winner Rito Jeptoo asserts that Kenyan athletes are not subjected to blood tests while training. Another Kenyan runner claims that the national federation suppresses positive doping results in return for bribes.

Seppelt also suggests the International Association of Athletics Federations isn't doing enough to address the problem of doping in endurance disciplines. After evaluating data on athletes' blood collected at major athletics competitions over a number of years, two Australian scientists conclude that doping is the only plausible explanation for some of the measurements. The IAAF also refused to speak with Seppelt about his suspicions.

In August 2015, he presented a nearly hour-long report questioning athletics in general and Kenya's long-distance runners in particular.

Shortly before the IAAF World Championships in London, German broadcaster ARD aired a new episode of ''Doping Top Secret'' in August 2017, titled "The Big Money Run. Africa's Athletes on Sale." The feature by Hajo Seppelt, Benjamin Best, Ulrike Unfug, and Grit Hartmann particularly examines people surrounding and influencing African Athletes in track and field disciplines. It focuses not only on doping, but also delves into shady practices of managers and into the numerous changes of nationality that occur in this core Olympic sport.

=== Doping in Russia ===
{{see also|Doping in Russia}}
In 2014, with the help of athletes who told their stories in front of the camera, Seppelt reported about widespread doping in Russia. In December of that year, ARD broadcast Seppelt's film ''Geheimsache Doping: Wie Russland seine Sieger macht'' (''The Doping Secret: How Russia Makes its Winners''). In this 60-minute documentary, whistleblowers testified to systematic doping in athletics and other sports in Russia. The film presents evidence for these allegations in form of footage and audio recordings secretly made by the whistleblowers as well as official documents. The documentary, which was followed a short time later by films in ARD and WDR, attracted substantial global media resonance and was broadcast worldwide in a number of languages. After its broadcast in Germany, several figures in international sports organizations and anti-doping institutions either resigned their posts or were suspended.&lt;ref&gt;
http://hajoseppelt.de/2014/12/the-secrets-of-doping-how-russia-makes-its-winners/&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, in its Sport Inside program, the WDR broadcast the third part of the series on doping in athletics with a focus on Russia: “Geheimsache Doping: Russlands Täuschungsmanöver” (“The Doping Secret: Russia’s Red Herrings”). In it, Hajo Seppelt, together with co-author Florian Riesewieck, showed how Russian coaches and officials avoided conditions of the World Athletics Federation IAAF and the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA. The 30-minute documentary once again received an extensive international echo and was broadcast in several countries.&lt;ref&gt;
http://hajoseppelt.de/2016/03/doping-secret-russias-red-herrings/&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016 the documentary "Doping - Top secret: The protection racket" (by Hajo Seppelt, Florian Riesewieck, Olga Sviridenko and Felix Becker)  is aired in ARD's weekly programme "Sportschau". It is based on a joint investigation by the French newspaper "Le Monde" and the ARD doping editorial team. The documentary is about criminal activities linked to doping and cover up in international athletics.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ardmediathek.de/tv/Sportschau/Doping-Top-Secret-The-Protection-Rack/Das-Erste/Video?bcastId=53524&amp;documentId=39197456&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018 the German broadcaster [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] announced that Russia declared a visa void which was issued on request of the broadcaster so Seppelt could report on the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], citing Russia that Seppelt is on the list of unwanted persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.presseportal.de/pm/6694/3941380|title=Das Erste: Russland verweigert Hajo Seppelt die Einreise, ARD-Doping-Experte steht auf der Liste "unerwünschter Personen"|last=|first=|date=2018-05-11|work=press release/presseportal.de|access-date=2018-05-11|language=de|trans-title=Das Erste: Russia denies Hajo Seppelt entry, ARD doping expert is on list of "unwanted persons"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://p.dw.com/p/2xYbB|title=German sports journalist Hajo Seppelt refused entry to Russia for World Cup|last=|first=|date=2018-05-11|website=dw.com|publisher=Deutsche Welle|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018 Hajo Seppelt and Florian Riesewieck produced another episode of the documentary series „Doping Top Secret“ in ARD – titled „Russia‘s Football Friends“. This time they focused on suspicious facts in football in Russia, host country of the World Cup.

=== Other reports ===
Prior to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, ARD broadcast the 45-minute-documentary “Flying High in the Middle Kingdom: Doping in China”, which Hajo Seppelt produced with Jo Goll. The film reported about doping and doping controls in China, in particular, about proven cases of stem-cell manipulation carried out on top athletes. At the International New York Film Festival, it won a world gold medal for long-form reporting. It was also awarded the main prize at the 2009 Sportfilm Liberec 2007 – World Facts Challenge Festival. 

Prior to the 2009 World Athletics Championships in Berlin, ARD broadcast the documentary “Doping Top Secret: The String-Pullers in Athletics“ by Hajo Seppelt and Robert Kempe about the people who pull the strings in doping in track-and-field.&lt;ref&gt;ARD, {{cite web |url=http://www.daserste.de/doku/beitrag_dyn~uid,dxikq58dhlz6cjy0~cm.asp |title=Geheimsache Doping |accessdate=2016-04-02 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212144923/http://www.daserste.de/doku/beitrag_dyn~uid,dxikq58dhlz6cjy0~cm.asp |archivedate=February 12, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, ARD broadcast the 30-minute feature “Geheimsache Doping Eiskalter Betrug” (“Doping Top Secret: „Ice-Cold Cheating”). In it, Hajo Seppelt, Robert Kempe and Jochen Leufgens took a look behind the scenes at winter sports.&lt;ref&gt;ARD, {{cite web |url=http://www.daserste.de/doku/beitrag_dyn~uid,8w5zcjd3z5erye6z~cm.asp |title=Geheimsache Doping - Eiskalter Betrug |accessdate=2016-04-02 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210033330/http://www.daserste.de/doku/beitrag_dyn~uid,8w5zcjd3z5erye6z~cm.asp |archivedate=February 10, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of research by Seppelt in September 2010 about the world's top cyclist [[Alberto Contador]], the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] UCI had to admit that the Spanish [[Tour de France]] winner had turned up positive in doping tests. It emerged that the UCI had wanted to keep a positive test by Contador for the substance [[Clenbuterol]] at the Tour de France in July 2010 under wraps.&lt;ref&gt;Tagesschau, {{cite web |url=https://www.tagesschau.de/sport/contador110.html |title=Radsport: Tour-de-France-Sieger Contador unter Dopingverdacht |accessdate=2015-03-22 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003105209/http://www.tagesschau.de/sport/contador110.html |archivedate=October 3, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, Contador was retroactively banned for two years, from August 2010 to August 2012, by the International [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS) for Clenbuterol use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportschau.de/sp/weitere/news201202/06/contador.jsp sportschau] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208225138/http://www.sportschau.de/sp/weitere/news201202/06/contador.jsp |date=2012-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, Seppelt and co-filmmaker Kempe had the chance to film footage about sports for a week in [[Pyongyang]], the capital of [[North Korea]]. The result was the documentary film ''Sport in Nordkorea - Einblicke in eine unbekannte Welt'' (''Sports in North Korea – A Look at an Unknown World''), which was broadcast by ARD in July 2011.

In 2013, Seppelt and Kempe completed a critical documentary about [[Thomas Bach]], shortly before he was elected president of the [[International Olympic Committee]].
In January 2017 Germany's ARD television aired another part of its “Doping Top Secret” series. The new episode focussed on Russian whistleblower Andrey Dmitriev. Frustrated with the persistence of doping in his home country's athletics community, the runner made secret video recordings. The footage enabled him to prove that a big-name coach suspended due to doping links is still working with athletes.

In April 2017, Hajo Seppelt and his colleague Thilo Neumann revealed the existence of positive doping tests for Clenbuterol in the context of follow-up checks during the 2008 Olympic Games in Peking. The journalists also uncovered that the IOC kept these results a secret in consultation with WADA. Research showed that the IOC did not follow up on these cases, even though the organization's regulations demand further investigation in case of positive doping tests. Among the athletes who were tested positive, there was at least one Jamaican sprinter. The IOC's declaration, stating that the positive tests were a result of the athletes’ consumption of meat from China which supposedly contained Clenbuterol and that therefore there where no investigations concerning other possible causes, engendered worldwide criticism.

In June 2017 the German Broadcaster a new Episode of „Doping Top Secret“, titled „Brazil’s dirty game“, was aired by ARD. The documentary by Hajo Seppelt, Florian Riesewieck und Thilo Neumann examined the topic of doping in the host country of the last Football World Championships and of the last Olympic Games. Massive failings and shortcomings of Brazil's doping prevention plans where substantiated. Additionally, a multitude of indications for a culture of doping, deeply rooted in Brazili Football and stretching up to the national elite could be found.

In June 2018 on occasion of the Football World Cup in Russia ARD German TV aired a documentary titled „Doping Top secret: Brazil’s Twelfth man“ (Authors: Hajo Seppelt, Florian Riesewieck, Edmund Willison) about doping in Brazilian football.

The '''Insomnia Summer Show''' was an event held by [[Insomnia Club]] and [[Attila Gergely]] on Saturday, July 18, 2009 at the [[Stadionul Olimpia|Olimpia Stadium]] in [[Satu Mare]], [[Romania]].&lt;ref name="Show"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informatia-zilei.ro/new/2009/07/08/insomnia-summer-show-cu-cage-fight-pe-stadionul-olimpia/|title=Insomnia Summer Show cu Cage Fight pe Stadionul Olimpia|date=8 July 2009|publisher=Informaţai Zilei|language=Romanian|accessdate=20 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured a [[beauty contest]], a [[martial arts]] tournament and three concerts. The announcer for the show was the famous [[Romania]]n actor and comedian [[Sorin Tănase]] from [[Baia Mare]].

The [[beauty contest]] was free to join and many local participants enrolled, including models from the modelling agency, Gaby's Models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaby-models.ro/|title=Gaby's Models|publisher=www.gaby-models.r|language=Romanian|accessdate=20 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were three concerts held, the first concert was from the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] rock band [[Slager Duo]], the second was performed by [[La Familia (rap group)|La Familia]] hip-hop singer Puya and the last concert which closed the event was performed by the [[Romania]]n [[electronic rock]] group [[Voltaj]].&lt;ref name="Show"/&gt;

One of the main events of the show was the [[martial arts]] tournament which featured five [[mixed martial arts]] (MMA) fights that took place in an eight-sided cage located in the middle of the stadium. There were only two categories, under and over {{convert|85|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The referees were Vasile Fușle and Gergely Attila, notable national and international [[judo]] referees.&lt;ref name="Peste"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informatia-zilei.ro/new/2009/07/20/peste-2-500-de-satmareni-la-concertul-puya-%C8%99i-voltaj/|title=Peste 2.500 de sătmăreni la concertul Puya și Voltaj|date=20 July 2009|publisher=Informaţai Zilei|language=Romanian|accessdate=20 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first match was between Cristian Pintea and Cristian Nichita, two kick-boxing contenders that ended after five minutes after Nichita submitted from Pintea's rear naked choke.&lt;ref name="Peste"/&gt;

The following two matches ended with a unanimous decision from the referees.&lt;ref name="Peste"/&gt; The fourth match was the shortest in the tournament, ending after only seven seconds when Raul Maghiar broke his foot after a [[Throw (grappling)|throw]] from the winner Zenobiu Mic, a judoka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazetanord-vest.ro/index_files/sport.htm |title=Match 4 |publisher=Gazeta de Nord Vest |language=Romanian |accessdate=20 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503095737/http://www.gazetanord-vest.ro/index_files/sport.htm |archivedate=May 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last match was the second shortest, lasting two minutes, the winner being Gică Apostu with a submission technique called a guillotine.&lt;ref name="Peste"/&gt;

'''Jack Ernest Pollard''' &lt;small&gt;[[Order of Australia|OAM]]&lt;/small&gt; (31 July 1926 – 25 May 2002) was an Australian sports journalist, writer and [[cricket]] historian.

==Early life==
Born in Sydney on 31 July 1926, Pollard began his journalism career in 1943 as a copy boy at Sydney's ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper. At the age of 18, he was called up to the [[Australian Army]], but a foot injury sustained during an army rugby game saw him sit out nine months at [[Holsworthy Barracks]]. The injury may have saved Pollard's life as his assigned platoon was [[New Guinea campaign|killed in action]] in [[New Guinea]] during World War II.

==Journalism career==
From 1945 to 1947, Pollard lived in post-war Japan working as a sports editor for the armed forces newspaper there. He returned to Sydney briefly, then moved to England, where he worked as a [[horse racing]] writer for a newspaper in [[Sheffield]].

In 1948, he started work as a correspondent for the [[Australian Associated Press]] in London which included a regular column, sometimes serious, other times humorous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article231011363 |title=The OTHER SIDE |newspaper=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]] |issue=2598 |location=Sydney |date=8 February 1953 |accessdate=23 January 2017 |page=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article230099260 |title=AUSTRALIA BLAMED FOR LEAGUE ROW |newspaper=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]] |issue=13,104 |location=Sydney |date=29 January 1952 |accessdate=23 January 2017 |page=22 (LATE FINAL EXTRA) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He covered many major sporting events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Pollard, Jack | title=Meet the Kangaroos : introducing the 1948/9 Australian Rugby League team with superb action shots and pen portraits of all the players | publication-date=1948 | publisher=Hotspur Publishing | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/16762612 | accessdate=23 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also covered events such as the [[1948 Summer Olympics]], ten [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon Championships]] and the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|1948 tour of England]] by [[Don Bradman]]'s [[Australia national cricket team|Australian cricket team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=David |authorlink= |author2= |title=ABC Australian Sports Almanac 2003 |year=2003 |publisher=Hardie Grant Books |location=Sydney |isbn=1-74064-056-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article130568003 |title=One man's view of cricket, both past and present |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=71 |issue=22,114 |date=3 November 1995 |accessdate=23 January 2017 |page=31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing career==
Pollard returned to Sydney in 1956, where he worked as a sports reporter until starting his own publishing company ('''Jack Pollard Publishing'''), which specialised in books on sport and leisure topics. Pollard was a prolific writer and editor, who produced a large number of sporting reference books, including a definitive five-volume history of [[Cricket in Australia|Australian cricket]], encyclopaedias on [[rugby union]], [[golf]], [[horse racing]] and a series of popular fishing guides. He also wrote biographies for several sports stars including tennis players [[Lew Hoad]] and [[Rod Laver]], cricketer [[Keith Miller]] and umpire [[Lou Rowan]], golfer [[Bruce Devlin]], rugby league players [[Ken Thornett]] and [[Johnny Raper]], and [[Australian Football League|VFL]] player [[Peter McKenna]].&lt;ref name="sahof"&gt;[http://www.sahof.org.au/hallOfFame/memberProfile/index.php?memberID=181&amp;memberType=general Jack Pollard OAM – Media] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831004014/http://sahof.org.au/hallOfFame/memberProfile/index.php?memberID=181&amp;memberType=general |date=31 August 2007 }}, [[Sport Australia Hall of Fame]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books on cricket==
Although Pollard's works included all Australian sports,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Pollard, Jack, 1926– | title=Ampol's Australian sporting records | publication-date=1969 | publisher=Pollard Publishing Co | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/21444147 | accessdate=23 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is his cricket writing that is considered an important part of his legacy.

==Retirement==
Pollard retired from publishing in 1981 to concentrate on writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article231270569 |title=NOTICE is hereby given that a petition to wind up Jack Pollard Publishing Pty Limited was, on 24th December, 1981, |newspaper=[[Government Gazette of the State of New South Wales]] |issue=17   |date=5 February 1982 |accessdate=23 January 2017 |page=580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Gibson, Mike | title=Sport historian yearns to write | journal=Bulletin (Sydney) | publication-date=11 August 1981 | issue=11 August 1981 | pages=84 | issn=0007-4039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on 25 May 2002, after suffering a stroke upon his return to Sydney from a research trip in [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]].

The '''Lauber Dezső Sports Hall''' is a sports hall in [[Pécs]] named after [[Dezső Lauber]]. This is the home of both Hungarian Championship A participant women's and men's basketball team of the city: [[PEAC-Pécs]] and [[PVSK Panthers|PVSK-Pannonpower]] (and was the home of the former women's basketball club [[Pécs 2010]].) It hosted the [[EuroBasket 1997 Women]] group stage and [[EuroLeague Women 2003–04]] final four.

Besides sport events, it also hosts other type of events. Mostly Hungarian performers have concerts, but international performers like [[Gilbert Bécaud]] have hit the stage. In 2008 [[Ole Nydahl]] [[buddhist]] [[lama]] has held presentation.

Address: Dr. Veress Endre street 10.

[[File:Peyton Manning passing.jpg|thumb|Peyton Manning was named AP NFL MVP five times, more than any other player in history.]]
The '''National Football League Most Valuable Player Award''' ('''NFL MVP''') is an award given by various entities to the [[American football]] player who is considered the most valuable in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) during the regular season. Organizations which currently give an NFL MVP award or have in the past include the [[Associated Press]] (AP), the [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]] (NEA), [[Pro Football Writers of America]] (PFWA), and [[United Press International]] (UPI). The first award described as a most valuable player award was the [[Joe F. Carr Trophy]], awarded by the NFL from {{NFL year|1938}} to {{NFL year|1946}}. Today, the AP award is considered the ''[[de facto]]'' official NFL MVP award.&lt;ref name=NewtonPFWA/&gt; Since the 2011 season, the NFL has held the annual [[NFL Honors]] ceremony to recognize the winner of the Associated Press MVP award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First-ever 'NFL Honors' show will be hosted by Baldwin in Indy|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d825af687/article/firstever-nfl-honors-show-will-be-hosted-by-baldwin-in-indy|website=NFL.com|publisher=National Football League|accessdate=June 21, 2016|date=January 3, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812081757/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d825af687/article/firstever-nfl-honors-show-will-be-hosted-by-baldwin-in-indy|archivedate=August 12, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Olympic Velodrome''' ({{lang-it|Velodromo Olimpico}}) was a sports venue located in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. Constructed for the [[1960 Summer Olympics]], it hosted the [[Cycling at the 1960 Summer Olympics|track cycling]] and [[Field hockey at the 1960 Summer Olympics|field hockey]] events.

The velodrome was constructed between 1957 and early 1960. Soon after it was built problems were found, as water was draining away the foundations on one side of the velodrome. Concrete was injected into the foundations, which solved the problem only temporarily. It was last used for competition in 1968, when it hosted the [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Velodrome in Rome|url=http://christoph.wernli.org/2008/08/velodrome-in-rome_12.html|publisher=christoph.wernli.org|accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this it was abandoned, until it was [[Building implosion|imploded]] on {{date|2008-07-24}}.

A  '''parachute''' is a device used to slow the motion of an object through an [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] by creating [[Drag (physics)|drag]] (or in the case of ram-air parachutes, aerodynamic [[Lift (force)|lift]]). Parachutes are usually made out of light, strong fabric, originally [[silk]], now most commonly [[nylon]].  They are typically dome-shaped, but vary, with rectangles, inverted domes, and others found. A variety of loads are attached to parachutes, including people, food, equipment, [[space capsule]]s, and [[Bomb#Delivery|bombs]].

A '''[[drogue chute]]''' is used to aid horizontal deceleration of a vehicle including [[fixed-wing aircraft]] and [[drag racing|drag racers]], provide stability, as to assist certain types of [[light aircraft]] in distress,&lt;ref&gt;Ballistic recovery systems {{US patent|4607814 A}}, Boris Popov, August 26, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael |last=Klesius |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/How-Things-Work-Whole-Airplane-Parachute.html |title=How Things Work: Whole-Airplane Parachute |work=Air &amp; Space |date=January 2011

== History ==
===Invention===
[[File:Conical Parachute, 1470s, British Museum Add. MSS 34,113, fol. 200v.jpg|thumb|upright|The oldest known depiction of a parachute, by an anonymous author ([[Italy]], 1470s).]]

The earliest fictional account of a parachute type of device was made some 4,000 years ago when the Chinese noticed that air resistance would slow a person's fall from a height. The [[Western Han Dynasty]] writer [[Sima Qian]] in his book ''[[Records of the Grand Historian|Historical Records]]'' recounts the story of Shun, a legendary Chinese emperor who ran away from his murderous father by climbing onto the top of a high granary. As there was nowhere to go, Shun grabbed two bamboo hats and leaped off and glided downward to safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Ancient Chinese Inventions |last=Deng |first=Yinke |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0521186926 |publication-date=March 3, 2011 |pages=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Oxford Companion to Archaeology |last=Beck |first=Charlotte  |last2=Fagan |first2=Brian |publisher=Oxford University Press  |year=1999 |isbn=978-0195076189 |publication-date=April 30, 1999 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest evidence for the modern parachute dates back to the [[Renaissance]] period.&lt;ref name="Lynn White 1968, 466"&gt;{{harnvb|White|1968|p=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest parachute design appears in an anonymous manuscript from 1470s [[Renaissance Italy]] (British Museum Add. MSS 34,113, fol. 200v), showing a free-hanging man clutching a crossbar frame attached to a conical canopy.&lt;ref name="Lynn White 1968, 462f."&gt;{{harnvb|White|1968|pp=462f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a safety measure, four straps ran from the ends of the rods to a waist belt, marked improvement over another folio (189v), which depicts a man trying to break the force of his fall by the means of two long cloth streamers fastened to two bars which he grips with his hands.&lt;ref name="Lynn White 1968, 465"&gt;{{harnvb|White|1968|p=465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the surface area of the first design appears to be too small to be effective and the wooden frame is superfluous and potentially harmful, the basic concept of a working parachute is apparent.&lt;ref name="Lynn White 1968, 465"/&gt;

Shortly after, a more sophisticated parachute was sketched by the [[polymath]] [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in his ''[[Codex Atlanticus]]'' (fol. 381v) dated to ca. 1485.&lt;ref name="Lynn White 1968, 462f."/&gt; Here, the scale of the parachute is in a more favorable proportion to the weight of the jumper. Leonardo's canopy was held open by a square wooden frame, which alters the shape of the parachute from conical to pyramidal.&lt;ref name="Lynn White 1968, 465"/&gt; It is not known whether the Italian inventor was influenced by the earlier design, but he may have learned about the idea through the intensive oral communication among [[Renaissance technology|artist-engineers of the time]].&lt;ref name="Lynn White 1968, 465f."&gt;{{harnvb|White|1968|pp=465f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feasibility of Leonardo's pyramidal design was successfully tested in 2000 by [[British people|Briton]] [[Adrian Nicholas]] and again in 2008 by the Swiss skydiver Olivier Vietti-Teppa.&lt;ref&gt;BBC: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/808246.stm Da Vinci's Parachute Flies] (2000); FoxNews: [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,352917,00.html Swiss Man Safely Uses Leonardo da Vinci Parachute] (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian of technology [[Lynn White]], these conical and pyramidal designs, much more elaborate than early artistic jumps with rigid [[parasol]]s in Asia, mark the origin of "the parachute as we know it."&lt;ref name="Lynn White 1968, 466"/&gt;

[[File:Homo Volans.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fausto Veranzio]]'s parachute design,  titled ''Homo Volans'' ("Flying Man"), from his ''Machinae Novae'' ("New Contraptions", published in 1615 or 1616)]]
The Croatian polymath and inventor [[Fausto Veranzio]] (1551–1617) examined da Vinci's parachute sketch and kept the square frame but replaced the canopy with a bulging sail-like piece of cloth that he came to realize decelerates a fall more effectively.&lt;ref name=" Lynn White 1968, 465"/&gt; A now-famous depiction of a parachute that he dubbed ''Homo Volans'' (Flying Man), showing a man parachuting from a tower, presumably [[St Mark's Campanile]] in [[Venice]], appeared in his book on mechanics, ''Machinae Novae'' ("New Machines", published in 1615 or 1616), alongside a number of other devices and technical concepts.&lt;ref name="World in Air"&gt;Francis Trevelyan Miller, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MdDNAAAAMAAJ The world in the air: the story of flying in pictures], G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1930, pages 101–106&lt;/ref&gt;

It was once widely believed that in 1617, Veranzio, then aged 65 and seriously ill, implemented his design and tested the parachute by jumping from St Mark's Campanile,&lt;ref name="Paratroops"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TM2EAAAAIAAJ ''He's in the paratroops now''], Alfred Day Rathbone, R.M. McBride &amp; Company, 1943, University of California.&lt;/ref&gt; from a bridge nearby,&lt;ref name="Croatian Language"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9kWNmVnolz0C&amp;pg=PA8 Bogdanski, René. ''The Croation Language by Example'']. As an example for [[Synchronic analysis|Diachronic analysis]]: ''One of his most important inventions, is, without doubt, the parachute, which he experimented and tested on himself, by jumping off a bridge in Venice. As documented by the English bishop John Wilkins (1614–1672) 30 years later, in his book ''Mathematical Magic'' published in London in 1648.&lt;/ref&gt; or from [[St. Martin's Cathedral, Bratislava|St Martin's Cathedral]] in [[Bratislava]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://parachute.askdefine.com/ Parachute] on askdefine.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120120204857/http://www.321chutelibre.fr/parachute/parachute-1.php Parachute] on 321chutelibre (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; In various publications it was errantly  claimed the event was documented some thirty years later by [[John Wilkins]], founder and secretary of the [[Royal Society]] in [[London]], in his book ''[[Mathematical Magick|Mathematical Magick or, the Wonders that may be Performed by Mechanical Geometry]]'', published in London in 1648.&lt;ref name="Croatian Language" /&gt;  However,  Wilkins wrote about flying, not parachutes, and does not mention Veranzio, a parachute jump, or any event in 1617.  Doubts about this test, which include a lack of written evidence, suggest it never occurred, and was instead a misreading of historical notes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aero.com/publications/parachutes/9511/pc1195.htm ''Parachuting''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117014746/http://www.aero.com/publications/parachutes/9511/pc1195.htm |date=November 17, 2015 }} (on Aero.com): "''Like his countryman's concept, Veranzio's seems to have remained an idea only. Though his idea was greatly publicized, no evidence has been found that there ever was a homo volans of his or any other time who tested and proved Veranzio's plan.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th and 19th centuries===

[[File:Early flight 02561u (4).jpg|thumb|upright| The first use of a frameless parachute, by [[André Garnerin]] in 1797]]
[[File: First parachute2.jpg|thumb|upright|Schematic depiction of Garnerin's parachute, from an early nineteenth-century illustration.]]
The modern parachute was invented in the late 18th century by [[Louis-Sébastien Lenormand]] in [[France]], who made the first recorded public jump in 1783. Lenormand also sketched his device beforehand.

Two years later, in 1785, Lenormand coined the word "parachute" by hybridizing an Italian prefix ''para'', an imperative form of ''parare'' = to avert, defend, resist, guard, shield or shroud,  from ''paro'' = to parry, and ''chute'', the French word for ''fall'', to describe the aeronautical device's real function.

Also in 1785, [[Jean-Pierre Blanchard]] demonstrated it as a means of safely disembarking from a [[hot-air balloon]]. While Blanchard's first parachute demonstrations were conducted with a dog as the passenger, he later claimed to have had the opportunity to try it himself in 1793 when his hot air balloon ruptured and he used a parachute to descend (this event was not witnessed by others).

Subsequent development of the parachute focused on it becoming more compact. While the early parachutes were made of [[linen]] stretched over a wooden frame, in the late 1790s, Blanchard began making parachutes from folded [[silk]], taking advantage of silk's strength and light [[weight]]. In 1797, [[André Garnerin]] made the first descent of a "frameless" parachute covered in silk.&lt;ref name="soden"&gt;{{cite book| last = Soden| first = Garrett| title = Defying Gravity: Land Divers, Roller Coasters, Gravity Bums, and the Human Obsession with Falling| url = https://books.google.com/?id=B4K0rfx_E_kC&amp;pg=PA18| year = 2005| publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company| isbn = 978-0-393-32656-7| pages = 21–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1804 [[Jérôme Lalande]] introduced a vent in the canopy to eliminate violent oscillations.&lt;ref name="soden"/&gt;

[[File:Gleb Kotelnikov.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Gleb Kotelnikov]] and his invention, the [[knapsack]] parachute]]
In 1907 [[Charles Broadwick]] demonstrated two key advances in the parachute he used to jump from [[hot air balloon]]s at [[fair]]s: he folded his parachute into a [[backpack|pack]] he wore on his [[back]] and the parachute was pulled from the pack by a [[static line]] attached to the balloon. When Broadwick jumped from the balloon, the static line became taut, pulled the parachute from the pack, and then snapped.&lt;ref name="airspace2010"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911 a successful test took place with a [[Crash test dummy|dummy]] at the [[Eiffel tower]] in [[Paris]]. The puppet's weight was 75&amp;nbsp;kg; the parachute's weight was 21&amp;nbsp;kg. The cables between puppet and the parachute were 9&amp;nbsp;m long.&lt;ref name="DePrins" /&gt; On February 4, 1912, [[Franz Reichelt]] jumped to his death from the tower during initial testing of his wearable parachute.
 
Also in 1911, [[Grant Morton]] made the first parachute jump from an [[airplane]], a [[Wright Model B]] piloted by [[Phil Parmalee]], at [[Venice Beach]], [[California]]. Morton's device was of the "throw-out" type where he held the parachute in his arms as he left the aircraft. In the same year&lt;!--1911--&gt;, Russian [[Gleb Kotelnikov]] invented the first knapsack parachute,&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; although [[Hermann Lattemann]] and his wife [[Katharina Paulus|Käthe Paulus]] had been jumping with bagged parachutes in the last decade of the 19th century.

[[File:Albert Berry parachute.jpg|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;[[Albert Berry (parachutist)|Albert Berry]] collapses his parachute on Kinloch Field at [[Jefferson Barracks Military Post|Jefferson Barracks]], [[Missouri]], after his jump on March 1, 1912.&lt;/center&gt;]]

In 1912, on a road near [[Tsarskoye Selo]], years before it became part of [[St. Petersburg]], Kotelnikov successfully demonstrated the braking effects of a parachute by accelerating a [[Russo-Balt]] automobile to its top speed and then opening a parachute attached to the back seat, thus also inventing the [[drogue parachute]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.bibliotekar.ru/divo/40-22.htm Parachuting] at the site Divo: The Russian Book of records and achievements {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1, 1912, [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] Captain [[Albert Berry (parachutist)|Albert Berry]] made the first (attached-type) parachute jump in the [[United States]] from a [[fixed-wing aircraft]], a [[Benoist Aircraft|Benoist]] pusher, while flying above [[Jefferson Barracks]], [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. The jump utilized a knapsack style parachute stored or housed in a casing on the jumper's body.

[[Štefan Banič]], an immigrant in the United States, from [[Slovakia]] patented an umbrella-like design in 1914&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|1108484}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sold (or donated) the patent to the United States military which later on modified his design, resulting in the first military parachute.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;[http://www.mat.savba.sk/MATEMATICI/matematici.php?cislo=7 Štefan Banič, Konštruktér, vynálezca], Matematický ústav, Slovenská akadémia vied, obituary.

On June 21, 1913, [[Georgia Broadwick]] became the first woman to parachute-jump from a moving aircraft, doing so over [[Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1914, while doing demonstrations for the [[U.S. Army]], Broadwick deployed her chute manually, thus becoming the first person to jump [[free-fall]].

[[File: Photography Q27506.jpg|thumb|Kite balloon observers preparing to descend by parachute.]]
The first military use of the parachute was by [[artillery observer]]s on tethered [[observation balloons]] in [[World War I]]. These were tempting targets for enemy [[fighter aircraft]], though difficult to destroy, due to their heavy [[anti-aircraft]] defenses. Because it was difficult to escape from them, and dangerous when on fire due to their hydrogen inflation, observers would abandon them and descend by parachute as soon as enemy aircraft were seen. The ground crew would then attempt to retrieve and deflate the balloon as quickly as possible. The main part of the parachute was in a bag suspended from the balloon with the pilot wearing only a simple waist harness attached to the main parachute. When the balloon crew jumped the main part of the parachute was pulled from the bag by the crew's waist harness, first the shroud lines, followed by the main canopy. This type of parachute was first adopted on a large scale for their observation balloon crews by the Germans, and then later by the British and French. While this type of unit worked well from balloons, it had mixed results when used on fixed-wing aircraft by the Germans, where the bag was stored in a compartment directly behind the pilot. In many instances where it did not work the shroud lines became entangled with the spinning aircraft. Although a number of famous German fighter pilots were saved by this type of parachute, including [[Hermann Göring]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n-MDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA809 May 1931, ''Popular Mechanics''] photo of observation balloon gondola with external bag parachutes used by British Royal Navy&lt;/ref&gt; no parachutes were issued to Allied "[[heavier-than-air]]" aircrew, since it was thought at the time that if a pilot had a parachute he would jump from the plane when hit rather than trying to save the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lee |first=Arthur Gould |title=No parachute |location=London |publisher=Jarrolds |year=1968 |isbn=0-09-086590-1 }} (?); [[Harper &amp; Row]] 1970, {{ISBN|978-0060125486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Airplane cockpits at that time also were not large enough to accommodate a pilot and a parachute, since a seat that would fit a pilot wearing a parachute would be too large for a pilot not wearing one. This is why the German type was stowed in the fuselage, rather than being of the "backpack" type. Weight was – at the very beginning – also a consideration since planes had limited load capacity. Carrying a parachute impeded performance and reduced the useful offensive and fuel load.

In the U.K., [[Everard Calthrop]], a railway engineer and breeder of Arab horses, invented and marketed through his Aerial Patents Company a "British Parachute" and the "Guardian Angel" parachute. [[Thomas Orde-Lees]], known as the "Mad Major," demonstrated that parachutes could be used successfully from a low height (he jumped from Tower Bridge in London)&lt;ref name="ant2005"&gt;[http://www.antarctic.org.nz/pdf/Antarctic/Antarctic.V23.4.2005.pdf], page 68, "The Journal of the New Zealand Antarctic Society" Vol 23, No. 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/documents/Research/RAF-Historical-Society-Journals/Journal-37-Seminar-Flight%20Safety.pdf "ROYAL AIR FORCE HISTORICAL SOCIETY JOURNAL, #37"], 2006, Page 28&lt;/ref&gt; which led to parachutes being used by the balloonists of the [[Royal Flying Corps]], though they were not available for aircraft.

In 1911, [[Solomon Lee Van Meter, Jr.]] of Lexington Kentucky, submitted for and in July 1916 received a patent for a backpack style parachute – the Aviatory Life Buoy.&lt;ref&gt;Aviatory Life Buoy, {{US patent|1192479}}, July 25, 1916, awarded to inventor Solomon Lee Van Meter, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt; His self-contained device featured a revolutionary quick-release mechanism – the ripcord – that allowed a falling aviator to expand the canopy only when safely away from the disabled aircraft.&lt;ref name=ket&gt;[http://www.ket.org/trips/aviation/vanmeter.htm Kentucky Aviation Pioneers – Solomon Lee Van Meter, Jr. (1888–1937)], KET Aviation Museum Of Kentucky&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto Heinecke, a German airship ground crewman, designed a parachute which the German air service introduced in 1918, becoming the world's first air service to introduce a standard parachute. Although many pilots were saved by these, their efficacy was relatively poor.

In the UK [[Sir Frank Mears]] who was serving as a Major in the [[Royal Flying Corps]] in France (Kite Balloon section) registered a patent in July 1918 for a parachute with a quick release buckle, known as the "Mears parachute" which was in common use from then onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/Details?uri=C2987551|title=The Discovery Service|first=The National|last=Archives|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-World War I===
The experience with parachutes during the war highlighted the need to develop a design that could be reliably used to exit a disabled airplane. For instance, tethered parachutes did not work well when the aircraft was spinning. After the war, Major Edward L. Hoffman of the [[United States Army]] led an effort to develop an improved parachute by bringing together the best elements of multiple parachute designs.  Participants in the effort included [[Leslie Irvin (parachutist)|Leslie Irvin]] and [[James Floyd Smith]]. The team eventually created the Airplane Parachute Type-A. This incorporated three key elements.
* storing the parachute in a soft pack worn on the back, as demonstrated by [[Charles Broadwick]] in 1906;
* a [[Ripcord (skydiving)|ripcord]] for manually deploying the parachute at a safe distance from the airplane, from a design by [[Albert Leo Stevens]]; and 
* a [[pilot chute]] that draws the main canopy from the pack.

In 1919, Irvin successfully tested the parachute by jumping from an airplane. The Type-A parachute was put into production and over time saved a number of lives.&lt;ref name="airspace2010"/&gt;  The effort was recognized by the awarding of the [[Robert J. Collier Trophy]] to Major Edward L. Hoffman in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;[https://naa.aero/awards/awards-and-trophies/collier-trophy/collier-1920-1929-winners Collier 1920–1929 Recipients], [[National Aeronautic Association]] web site.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irvin became the first person to make a premeditated free-fall parachute jump from an airplane. An early brochure of the Irvin Air Chute Company credits William O'Connor as having become, on August 24, 1920, at [[McCook Field]] near [[Dayton, Ohio]], the first person to be saved by an Irvin parachute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ralph S. |last=Cooper |url=http://home.earthlink.net/~ralphcooper/pimagz17.htm |title=The Irvin Parachute, 1924 |publisher=Earthlink.net |accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another life-saving jump was made at McCook Field by test pilot Lt. Harold H. Harris on October 20, 1922. Shortly after Harris' jump, two Dayton newspaper reporters suggested the creation of the [[Caterpillar Club]] for successful parachute jumps from disabled aircraft.

In July 4, 1924 (patent №1607) [[Gleb Kotelnikov]] of Russia became the first parachutist to apply the soft packing of a parachute instead of a hard casing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yazib.org/yb030604.html Russian parachute of Kotelnikov] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with [[Italy]] in 1927, several countries experimented with using parachutes to [[paratroopers|drop soldiers behind enemy lines]]. The regular [[Soviet Airborne Troops]] were established as early as 1931 after a number of experimental military mass jumps starting from August 2, 1930.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Earlier the same year, the first Soviet mass jumps led to the development of the parachuting sport in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=" history"/&gt; By the time of [[World War II]], large [[airborne forces]] were trained and used in surprise attacks, as in the battles for [[Battle of Fort Eben-Emael|Fort Eben-Emael]] and [[Battle for The Hague|The Hague]], the first large-scale, opposed landings of paratroopers in military history, by the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Dr L. de Jong, 'Het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden in de Tweede Wereldoorlog', (Dutch language) part 3, RIOD, Amsterdam, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed later in the war by airborne assaults on a larger scale, such as the [[Battle of Crete]] and [[Operation Market Garden]], the latter being the largest airborne military operation ever.&lt;ref&gt;Dr L. de Jong, 'Het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden in de Tweede Wereldoorlog', (Dutch language) part 10a-II, RIOD, Amsterdam, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Aircraft crew were routinely equipped with parachutes for emergencies as well.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In 1937, [[drag chute]]s were used in aviation for the first time, by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] airplanes in the [[Arctic]] that were providing support for the polar expeditions of the era, such as the first [[manned drifting ice station]] [[North Pole-1]]. The drag chute allowed airplanes to land safely on smaller [[drift ice|ice-floes]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

== Types ==
Today's modern parachutes are classified into two categories – ascending and descending canopies.  All ascending canopies refer to [[paraglider]]s, built specifically to ascend and stay aloft as long as possible.  Other parachutes, including ram-air non-elliptical, are classified as descending canopies by manufacturers.

Some modern parachutes are classified as semi-rigid wings, which are maneuverable and can make a controlled descent to collapse on impact with the ground.

=== Round ===
[[File:USMC Paratrooper.jpg|thumb|upright|An American [[paratrooper]] using an MC1-1C series "round" parachute.]]
Round parachutes are purely a drag device (that is, unlike the ram-air types, they provide no [[lift (force)|lift]]) and are used in military, emergency and cargo applications.  Most have large dome-shaped canopies made from a single layer of triangular cloth [[Gore (segment)|gores]].  Some skydivers call them "jellyfish 'chutes" because of the resemblance to the marine organisms. Modern sports parachutists rarely use this type.
The first round parachutes were simple, flat circulars. These early parachutes suffered from instability caused by oscillations.  A hole in the apex helped to vent some air and reduce the oscillations.  Many military applications adopted conical, ''i.e.'', cone-shaped, or parabolic (a flat circular canopy with an extended skirt) shapes, such as the United States Army [[T-10 parachute|T-10]] static-line parachute. A round parachute with no holes in it is more prone to oscillate and is not considered to be steerable. Some parachutes have inverted dome-shaped canopies. These are primarily used for dropping non-human payloads due to their faster rate of descent.

Forward speed (5–13&amp;nbsp; km/h) and steering can be achieved by cuts in various sections (gores) across the back, or by cutting four lines in the back thereby modifying the canopy shape to allow air to escape from the back of the canopy, providing limited forward speed. Other modifications sometimes used are cuts in various sections (gores) to cause some of the skirt to bow out.  Turning is accomplished by forming the edges of the modifications, giving the parachute more speed from one side of the modification than the other. This gives the jumpers the ability to steer the parachute (such as the United States Army MC series parachutes), enabling them to avoid obstacles and to turn into the wind to minimize horizontal speed at [[landing]].

=== Cruciform  ===
The unique design characteristics of cruciform parachutes decrease oscillation (its user swinging back and forth) and violent turns during descent.  This technology will be used by the United States Army as it replaces its older T-10 parachutes with [[T-11 parachute]]s under a program called Advanced Tactical Parachute System (ATPS).  The ATPS canopy is a highly modified version of a cross/ cruciform platform and is square in appearance. The ATPS system will reduce the rate of descent by 30 percent from {{convert|21|ft/s|m/s}} to {{convert|15.75|ft/s|m/s}}. The T-11 is designed to have an average rate of descent 14% slower than the T-10D, thus resulting in lower landing injury rates for jumpers. The decline in the rate of descent will reduce the impact energy by almost 25% to lessen the potential for injury.

=== Annular and pull down apex ===
[[File:typhoon deploying parachute arp.jpg|thumb|[[RAF]] [[Eurofighter Typhoon|Typhoon]] using a [[drogue parachute]] for braking after landing.]]

A variation on the round parachute is the pull-down apex parachute.  Invented by a Frenchman named Pierre-Marcel Lemoigne,&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Marcel Lemoigne, {{US patent|3228636}} (filed: November 7, 1963; issued: January 11, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jean-Michel |last=Palau |url=http://jmp-pan.blogspot.com/2008/02/historique-du-parachutisme-ascensionnel_988.html |title=Historique du Parachutisme Ascensionnel Nautique |date=February 20, 2008 |accessdate=October 22, 2013 |publisher=Le Parachutisme Ascensionnel Nautique |language=French}} Includes '''photo''' of Lemoigne.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also:  Theodor W. Knacke, "Technical-historical development of parachutes and their applications since World War I (Technical paper A87-13776 03-03)," 9th Aerodynamic Decelerator and Balloon Technology Conference (Albuquerque, New Mexico; October 7–9, 1986) (New York, N.Y.:  American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 1986), pages 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt; it is called a Para-Commander canopy in some circles, after the first model of the type. It is a round parachute, but with suspension lines to the canopy apex that apply load there and pull the apex closer to the load, distorting the round shape into a somewhat flattened or lenticular shape.

Some designs have the fabric removed from the apex to open a hole through which air can exit, giving the canopy an annular geometry. They also have decreased horizontal drag due to their flatter shape and, when combined with rear-facing vents, can have considerable forward speed.

=== Rogallo wing ===
Sport parachuting has experimented with the [[Rogallo wing]], among other shapes and forms.  These were usually an attempt to increase the forward speed and reduce the landing speed offered by the other options at the time.  The ram-air parachute's development and the subsequent introduction of the sail slider to slow deployment reduced the level of experimentation in the sport parachuting community. The parachutes are also hard to build.

=== Ribbon and Ring ===
[[File:HiRISE image of MSL during EDL (refined).png|thumb|The [[Mars Science Laboratory]] descending under a ring parachute.]]
Ribbon and ring parachutes have similarities to annular designs. They are frequently designed to deploy at [[supersonic]] speeds. A conventional parachute would instantly burst upon opening and be shredded at such speeds. Ribbon parachutes have a ring-shaped canopy, often with a large hole in the centre to release the pressure. Sometimes the ring is broken into ribbons connected by ropes to leak air even more. These large leaks lower the stress on the parachute so it does not burst or shred when it opens. Ribbon parachutes made of [[Kevlar]] are used on nuclear bombs, such as the [[B61 nuclear bomb|B61]] and [[B83 nuclear bomb|B83]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Mitcheltree| first=R| last2=Witkowski| first2=A| title=High Altitude Test Program for a Mars Subsonic Parachute| journal=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics| url=http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/37615/1/05-0981.pdf| postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

=== Ram-air ===
Ram-air parafoils are steerable, and have two layers of fabric—top and bottom—connected by airfoil-shaped fabric ribs to form "cells". The cells fill with higher-pressure air from vents that face forward on the leading edge of the airfoil. The fabric is shaped and the parachute lines trimmed under load such that the ballooning fabric inflates into an airfoil shape. This airfoil is sometimes maintained by use of fabric one-way valves called ''[[Airlock (parachute)|airlocks]]''.  The first ram-air test jump was performed{{when|date=August 2018}} by United States Navy test jumper Joe Crotwell.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==== Varieties ====
[[File:Ram air square.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A [[United States Navy]] Parachute Team "Leap Frogs" jumper landing a "square" ram-air parachute.]]
Personal ram-air parachutes are loosely divided into two varieties – rectangular or tapered – commonly called "squares" or "ellipticals", respectively. Medium-performance canopies (reserve-, [[BASE jumping|BASE]]-, canopy formation-, and accuracy-type) are usually rectangular. High-performance, ram-air parachutes have a slightly tapered shape to their leading and/or trailing edges when viewed in plan form, and are known as ellipticals. Sometimes all the taper is on the leading edge (front), and sometimes in the trailing edge (tail).

Ellipticals are usually used only by sport parachutists. They often have smaller, more numerous fabric cells and are shallower in profile. Their canopies can be anywhere from slightly elliptical to highly elliptical, indicating the amount of taper in the canopy design, which is often an indicator of the responsiveness of the canopy to control input for a given wing loading, and of the level of experience required to pilot the canopy safely.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The rectangular parachute designs tend to look like square, inflatable air mattresses with open front ends. They are generally safer to operate because they are less prone to dive rapidly with relatively small control inputs, they are usually flown with lower wing loadings per square foot of area, and they glide more slowly. They typically have a lower [[glide ratio]].

Wing loading of parachutes is measured similarly to that of aircraft, comparing exit weight to area of parachute fabric. Typical wing loading for students, accuracy competitors, and BASE jumpers is less than 5&amp;nbsp; kg per square meter – often 0.3 kilograms per square meter or less. Most student skydivers fly with wing loading below 5&amp;nbsp; kg per square meter. Most sport jumpers fly with wing loading between 5 and 7&amp;nbsp; kg per square meter, but many interested in performance landings exceed this wing loading. Professional Canopy pilots compete with wing loading of 10 to over 15 kilograms per square meter. While ram-air parachutes with wing loading higher than 20 kilograms per square meter have been landed, this is strictly the realm of professional test jumpers.

Smaller parachutes tend to fly faster for the same load, and ellipticals respond faster to control input. Therefore, small, elliptical designs are often chosen by experienced canopy pilots for the thrilling flying they provide. Flying a fast elliptical requires much more skill and experience. Fast ellipticals are also considerably more dangerous to land. With high-performance elliptical canopies, nuisance malfunctions can be much more serious than with a square design, and may quickly escalate into emergencies. Flying highly loaded, elliptical canopies is a major contributing factor in many skydiving accidents, although advanced training programs are helping to reduce this danger.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

High-speed, cross-braced parachutes, such as the Velocity, VX, XAOS, and Sensei, have given birth to a new branch of sport parachuting called "swooping." A race course is set up in the landing area for expert pilots to measure the distance they are able to fly past the {{convert|1.5|m|ft|adj=on}} tall entry gate. Current world records exceed {{convert|180|m|ft}}.

Aspect ratio is another way to measure ram-air parachutes. Aspect ratios of parachutes are measured the same way as aircraft wings, by comparing span with chord. Low aspect ratio parachutes, ''i.e.'', span 1.8 times the chord, are now limited to precision landing competitions. Popular precision landing parachutes include Jalbert (now NAA) Para-Foils and John Eiff's series of Challenger Classics. While low aspect ratio parachutes tend to be extremely stable, with gentle stall characteristics, they suffer from steep glide ratios and a small tolerance, or "sweet spot", for timing the landing flare.

Because of their predictable opening characteristics, parachutes with a medium aspect ratio around 2.1 are widely used for reserves, BASE, and canopy formation competition.  Most medium aspect ratio parachutes have seven cells.

High aspect ratio parachutes have the flattest glide and the largest tolerance for timing the landing flare, but the least predictable openings. An aspect ratio of 2.7 is about the upper limit for parachutes. High aspect ratio canopies typically have nine or more cells. All reserve ram-air parachutes are of the square variety, because of the greater reliability, and the less-demanding handling characteristics.

==== General characteristics ====
[[File: Roadside chai shop made of old parachute.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Roadside chai shop made of old parachute in Ladakh, India.]]
Main parachutes used by [[skydiver]]s today are designed to open softly. Overly rapid deployment was an early problem with ram-air designs. The primary innovation that slows the deployment of a ram-air canopy is the [[slider (parachuting)|slider]]; a small rectangular piece of fabric with a [[grommet]] near each corner. Four collections of lines go through the grommets to the risers (risers are strips of webbing joining the harness and the rigging lines of a parachute). During deployment, the slider slides down from the canopy to just above the risers. The slider is slowed by air resistance as it descends and reduces the rate at which the lines can spread. This reduces the speed at which the canopy can open and inflate.

At the same time, the overall design of a parachute still has a significant influence on the deployment speed. Modern sport parachutes' deployment speeds vary considerably. Most modern parachutes open comfortably, but individual skydivers may prefer harsher deployment.

The deployment process is inherently chaotic. Rapid deployments can still occur even with well-behaved canopies. On rare occasions, deployment can even be so rapid that the jumper suffers bruising, injury, or death. Reducing the amount of fabric decreases the air resistance.  This can be done by making the slider smaller, inserting a mesh panel, or cutting a hole in the slider.

== Deployment ==
[[File:3Ring release animation.gif|thumb|upright|Animation of 3-ring release system used by a skydiver to cut away the main parachute. It utilizes a [[mechanical advantage]] of 200 to 1.]]
Reserve parachutes usually have a [[ripcord (skydiving)|ripcord]] deployment system, which was first designed by Theodore Moscicki, but most modern main parachutes used by sports parachutists use a form of hand-deployed [[pilot chute]]. A ripcord system pulls a closing pin (sometimes multiple pins), which releases a spring-loaded pilot chute, and opens the container; the pilot chute is then propelled into the air stream by its spring, then uses the force generated by passing air to extract a deployment bag containing the parachute canopy, to which it is attached via a bridle. A hand-deployed pilot chute, once thrown into the air stream, pulls a closing pin on the pilot chute bridle to open the container, then the same force extracts the deployment bag. There are variations on hand-deployed pilot chutes, but the system described is the more common throw-out system.

Only the hand-deployed pilot chute may be collapsed automatically after deployment—by a kill line reducing the in-flight drag of the pilot chute on the main canopy. Reserves, on the other hand, do not retain their pilot chutes after deployment. The reserve deployment bag and pilot chute are not connected to the canopy in a reserve system. This is known as a free-bag configuration, and the components are sometimes not recovered after a reserve deployment.

Occasionally, a pilot chute does not generate enough force either to pull the pin or to extract the bag. Causes may be that the pilot chute is caught in the turbulent wake of the jumper (the "burble"), the closing loop holding the pin is too tight, or the pilot chute is generating insufficient force. This effect is known as "pilot chute hesitation," and, if it does not clear, it can lead to a total malfunction, requiring reserve deployment.

Paratroopers' main parachutes are usually deployed by static lines that release the parachute, yet retain the deployment bag that contains the parachute—without relying on a pilot chute for deployment. In this configuration, the deployment bag is known as a direct-bag system, in which the deployment is rapid, consistent, and reliable.

== Safety ==
A parachute is carefully folded, or "packed" to ensure that it will open reliably. If a parachute is not packed properly it can result in a malfunction where the main parachute fails to deploy correctly or fully. In the United States and many developed countries, emergency and reserve parachutes are packed by "[[Parachute rigger|riggers]]" who must be trained and certified according to legal standards. Sport skydivers are always trained to pack their own primary "main" parachutes.

Exact numbers are difficult to estimate because parachute design, maintenance, loading, packing technique and operator experience has a significant impact on malfunction rates. Approximately one in a thousand sport main parachute openings malfunctions, requiring the use of the reserve parachute, although some skydivers have many thousands of jumps and never needed to use their reserve parachute.

Reserve parachutes are packed and deployed somewhat differently. They are also designed more conservatively, favouring reliability over responsiveness and are built and tested to more exacting standards, making them more reliable than main parachutes. Regulated inspection intervals, coupled with significantly less use contributes to reliability as wear on some components can adversely affect reliability. The primary safety advantage of a reserve parachute comes from the [[probability]] of an unlikely main malfunction being multiplied by the even less likely probability of a reserve malfunction. This yields an even smaller probability of a double malfunction, although there is also a small possibility that a malfunctioning main parachute cannot be released and thus interfere with the reserve parachute. In the United States, the 2017 average fatality rate is recorded to be 1 in 133,571 jumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://uspa.org/Find/FAQs/Safety |title=Skydiving Safety |publisher=United States Parachute Association |accessdate=November 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822014822/https://uspa.org/Find/FAQs/Safety |dead-url=no |archive-date=August 21, 2018|df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Injuries and fatalities in sport skydiving are possible even under a fully functional main parachute, such as may occur if the skydiver makes an error in judgment while flying the canopy which results in a high-speed impact either with the ground or with a hazard on the ground, which might otherwise have been avoided, or results in collision with another skydiver under canopy.

== Malfunctions ==
{{see also|Malfunction (parachuting)}}
&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Paratrooper]] --&gt;
[[File: Apollo 15 descends to splashdown.jpg|thumb|The [[Apollo 15]] spacecraft landed safely despite a parachute line failure in 1971.]]
Below are listed the malfunctions specific to round parachutes. 
* A "Mae West" or "blown periphery" is a type of round parachute malfunction that contorts the shape of the canopy into the outward appearance of a large [[brassiere]], named after the generous proportions of the late actress [[Mae West]].  The column of nylon fabric, buffeted by the wind, rapidly heats from friction and opposite sides of the canopy can fuse together in a narrow region, removing any chance of it opening fully.
*A "streamer" is the main chute which becomes entangled in its lines and fails to deploy, taking the shape of a paper streamer.  The parachutist cuts it away to provide space and clean air for deploying the reserve.&lt;ref name="scott"/&gt;
* An "inversion" occurs when one skirt of the canopy blows between the suspension lines on the opposite side of the parachute and then catches air. That portion then forms a secondary lobe with the canopy inverted. The secondary lobe grows until the canopy turns completely inside out.
* A "[[barber's pole]]" describes having a tangle of lines behind the jumper's head, who cuts away the main and opens his reserve.&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;[http://www.screamingeagle.org/PDFs/JumpSchoolatFortBenning.pdf Scott Royce E.

*The "[[Malfunction (parachuting)#Horseshoe|horseshoe]]" is an out-of-sequence deployment, when the parachute lines and bag are released before the bag drogue and bridle. This can cause the lines to become tangled or a situation where the parachute drogue is not released from the container.&lt;ref name="scott"/&gt;
*"Jumper-In-Tow" involves a static line that does not disconnect, resulting in a jumper being towed behind the aircraft.&lt;ref name="scott"/&gt;

[[File: HIGUEROTE DESDE EL AIRE.png|thumb|upright|A jumper in Venezuela with his parachute on his back]]

On August 16, 1960, [[Joseph Kittinger]], in the [[Project Excelsior#Test jumps|Excelsior III test jump]], set the previous world record for the highest parachute jump. He jumped from a [[balloon]] at an altitude of {{Convert|102800|ft|m|0}} (which was also a manned balloon altitude record at the time). A small stabilizer chute deployed successfully, and Kittinger fell for 4 minutes and 36 seconds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jeffrey S. Hampton |title='Hero of Aviation' speaks about record-setting free fall |work=[[The Virginian-Pilot]] |page=Y1 |date=December 15, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; also setting a still-standing world record for the longest parachute [[free-fall]], if falling with a stabilizer chute is counted as free-fall. At an altitude of {{Convert|17500|ft|m|-2}}, Kittinger opened his main chute and landed safely in the [[New Mexico]] desert. The whole descent took 13 minutes and 45 seconds.&lt;ref name=Friend&gt;{{cite news | author=Tim Friend | title=Out of thin air His free fall from {{convert|20|mi|km}} put NASA on firm footing | work=[[USA Today]] | page=1D | date=August 18, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the descent, Kittinger experienced temperatures as low as {{convert|-94|°F|°C|0}}. In the free-fall stage, he reached a top speed of 614&amp;nbsp;mph (988&amp;nbsp;km/h or 274&amp;nbsp;m/s), or Mach 0.8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stratocat.com.ar/fichas-e/1960/HMN-19600816.htm |title=Data of the stratospheric balloon launched on 8/16/1960 For EXCELSIOR III |publisher=Stratocat.com.ar |date=September 25, 2013 |accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', [[Yevgeni Nikolayevich Andreyev]] ([[Soviet Union]]) held the official FAI record for the longest free-fall parachute jump (without [[drogue chute]]) after falling for 24,500&amp;nbsp;m (80,380&amp;nbsp;ft) from an altitude of 25,457&amp;nbsp;m (83,523&amp;nbsp;ft) near the city of [[Saratov, Russia]] on November 1, 1962, until broken by [[Felix Baumgartner]] in 2012.

[[Felix Baumgartner]] broke Joseph Kittinger's record on October 14, 2012, with a [[Red Bull Stratos|jump]] from an altitude of 127,852 feet (38,969.3 m) and reaching speeds up to 833.9&amp;nbsp;mph (1,342.0&amp;nbsp;km/h or 372.8&amp;nbsp;m/s), or nearly Mach&amp;nbsp;1.1.  Kittinger was an advisor for Baumgartner's jump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/faster-than-the-speed-of-sound-the-man-who-falls-to-earth-1877875.html|title=Faster than the speed of sound: the man who falls to earth|date=January 25, 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Eustace]] made a jump from the stratosphere on October 24, 2014, from an altitude of 135,889.108 feet (41,419 m). However, because Eustace's jump involved a [[drogue parachute]] while Baumgartner's did not, their vertical speed and free fall distance records remain in different record categories.

'''Scotiabank Arena''', formerly the '''Air Canada Centre&lt;!-- This article uses Canadian English. "Centre" is the correct spelling in this case. --&gt;''', is a multi-purpose [[arena]] located on [[Bay Street]] in the [[South Core, Toronto|South Core]] district of [[Downtown Toronto|Downtown]] [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. It is the home of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), the [[Toronto Raptors]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and the [[Toronto Rock]] of the [[National Lacrosse League]] (NLL).  In addition, the minor league [[Toronto Marlies]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) and the [[Raptors 905]] of the [[NBA G League]] play occasional games at the arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marlies.ca/news/News.asp?story_id=221 |title=Bulldogs Bite Marlies At Air Canada Centre |date=2005-11-03 |accessdate=2015-06-30 |first=John |last=Bartlett |publisher=[[Toronto Marlies]] }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The area was previously home to the [[Toronto Phantoms]] of the [[Arena Football League]] (AFL) during their brief existence.

The arena is owned and operated by [[Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment|Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment Ltd.]] (MLSE), the same group that owns both the Leafs and Raptors, as well as their respective development teams, and is {{convert|61780.5|m2|sqft}} in size. In 2008, the Scotiabank Arena was the fifth busiest arena in the world and the busiest in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/mts_centre_19th-busiest_showbiz_venue_in_world38266214.html|title=MTS Centre 19th-busiest showbiz venue in world|last=MacLean|first=Cameron|work=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]|date=January 24, 2009|accessdate=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the most photographed location in Canada on [[Instagram]] according to [[BuzzFeed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/leafs/2018/07/01/scotiabank-arena-now-officially-the-home-of-maple-leafs-and-raptors.html|title=Scotiabank Arena now officially the home of Maple Leafs and Raptors - The Star|publisher=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotiabank Arena is connected to [[Union Station (Toronto)|Toronto Union]] railway station, [[Union station (TTC)|subway station]] and [[Union Station Bus Terminal|bus terminal]] via the [[PATH (Toronto)|PATH]].

Scotiabank Arena has, from its initial design to completion, revolutionized many concepts included in new arenas and stadiums built since then. These features include luxury suites accessible on the ground floor, splitting the main scoreboard into several sections, rotating all sponsor signage in the bowl at once (to allow dominant messaging or "neutralization" for events that disallow commercial advertising), and multiple restaurants in and out of the main arena bowl view.

Scotiabank Arena also hosts other events, such as concerts, political conventions and [[Esports|video game competitions]].

==History==
The arena site was once occupied by [[Canada Post]]'s Toronto Postal Delivery Building (designed by [[Charles B. Dolphin]]). The Canada Post building was built in 1938, in hope that it would assist in the recent population growth of Toronto and its surrounding area.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotiabankarena.com/venue-information/about/history|title=History {{!}} Scotiabank Arena|last=Arena|first=Scotiabank|website=www.scotiabankarena.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was briefly handed over to Department of National Defence for war storage purposes upon completion in 1941, but returned to Canada Post in 1946. Modifications were added to the Canada Post building in order for it to be more adequately equipped for postal delivery, after it was altered due to the Department of National Defence. After the work was completed in 1948, the building now posed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing functions. In the early 1990s the building was in need of major renovations, so in order to cut costs Canada Post decided to close the faciliy and move operations to an alternate letter processing plant. This processing plant, which had been constructed in the 1970s, was located on Eastern Avenue and eventually all of the old building's work was transferred here.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post with equal ownership, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space. The financial and development details of the purchase had various conditions around the property being rezoned by the city, and remediation of soil contamination by Canada Post before any development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bramalea's Moves Shake Taxpayers|first=Stevie|last=Cameron|date=November 15, 1992|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to financial difficulties, the building ownership was returned to Canada Post in 1993. The Toronto Raptors purchased the building from Canada Post the next year.&lt;ref name="rapnba"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/history/raptors_history.html/| title=Laying the Groundwork for the NBA in Toronto| website=nba.com| accessdate=October 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Postal terminal now Air Canada Centre.jpg|thumb|left|The arena retains the eastern wall of the original postal structure built in 1941, through a process of [[facadism]].]]
Construction of Air Canada Centre, now called Scotiabank Arena, was started by the Toronto Raptors, under their initial ownership group headed by Canadian businessman [[John Bitove]]. In 1995, it was decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and the lot size. Other venues such as [[BMO Field|Exhibition place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered. The Canada Post building was purchased for $60 million.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Raptors initially played in SkyDome (now [[Rogers Centre]]) while the arena was constructed.&lt;ref name="blogTo"&gt;{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Bateman|title=That time the Raptors and the Maple Leafs moved to the ACC|url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2014/02/that_time_the_raptors_and_leafs_moved_to_the_acc/|website=blogTo|date=February 22, 2014|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groundbreaking took place in March 1997. The building retained the [[Art Deco]] facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.

While construction was in progress, the Raptors and their partially completed arena were purchased by MLSE, which was contemplating building their own arena for the Maple Leafs to replace the aging [[Maple Leaf Gardens]].&lt;ref name="blogTo"/&gt; MLSE subsequently ordered major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217 million, MLSE increased the budget to $265 million after taking control.&lt;ref name=cost&gt;{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1998, the building's construction was completed and the opening basketball game, hockey game and first concert took place early the next year. The opening hockey game took place February 20, 1999 (Toronto Maple Leafs vs. [[Montreal Canadiens]]), the opening basketball Game took place February 21, 1999 (Toronto Raptors vs. [[Vancouver Grizzlies]]), and the opening concert took place February 22, 1999 ([[The Tragically Hip]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Features of the new building consist of a 65,000-square-foot arena and a 165,000-square-foot office tower. There is also east-west covered, climate controlled galleria and walkway onsite that contains restaurants, the ticket office, and other commercial units. The Galleria also connects the Scotiabank arena to popular locations in the downtown core such as Union Station, Bay street and York Street. Scotiabank Arena is connected to the underground PATH network. The Galleria also acts as a historical museum by displaying numerous artifacts from the old Canada Post building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcl.com/Projects-that-Inspire/Pages/Air-Canada-Centre.aspx|title=Air Canada Centre|work=PCL Constructors|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its first ten years of operation, the new arena had an estimated economic benefit of $2.4 billion. This boosted Toronto's economy and led to the motivation of further construction in the downtown core. It led to many projects in the area getting completed ahead of schedule as a result of a desire to increase the infrastructure of downtown Toronto, and also from private funding (approximately $13 million) that was invested in seeing the economic growth of Toronto. These projects included the Bay West Teamway, Union Plaza, the Galleria (shopping centre), and Bremner Boulevard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Air Canada]] purchased [[naming rights]] to the arena for US$30 million for 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/marketing/|work=CBC News|title=Branding for dollars|date=February 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2003, MLSE completed a $5 million upgrade of the arena, including a new LED signage system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=459588|title=Air Canada Centre Renovations to Improve Ultimate Fan Experience|date=September 9, 2003|accessdate=January 6, 2014|publisher=[[Toronto Maple Leafs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the summer of 2015, a $10 million upgrade of the arena was carried out, which included the installation of a new scoreboard four times as large as the previous one.  The old scoreboard was later installed at [[Coca-Cola Coliseum|Ricoh Coliseum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/leafs/2015/07/24/acc-to-debut-new-scoreboard-this-year.html|title=Air Canada Centre to debut new scoreboard this year|first=Raju|last=Mudhar|date=2015-07-24|accessdate=2015-07-24|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the winter of 2003, The Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario handed over a seven-day penalty to the area. This was because of the arena “permitting drunken patrons to be in the licensed patrons.” This was said to have occurred in the fall of 2002 at a Toronto Maple Leafs game and also a [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] concert. As a result of these misdemeanours, there was no alcohol to be served at the arena from December 21-28, 2003. The venue had multiple major events during this time frame which included a Toronto Raptors-[[Orlando Magic]] game on Dec. 21, a Toronto Maple Leafs-[[Florida Panthers]] game on Dec. 23, and [[Disney on Ice|Disney On Ice]]: Toy Story 2, which ran from Dec. 25-Jan. 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/sports/air-canada-centre-loses-liquor-licence-for-a-week-1.401537|title=Air Canada Centre loses liquor licence for a week {{!}} CBC Sports|work=CBC|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 2014, a group of statues known as ''Legends Row'' was unveiled outside the arena at the southwest corner of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/leafs/2014/09/06/maple_leaf_legends_row_unveils_first_three_honourees.html|title=Maple Leafs Legends Row starts with Ted Kennedy, Darryl Sittler, Johnny Bower|publisher=Torstar Corporation|accessdate=September 27, 2018|work=Toronto Star|date=September 7, 2014|last=Rubin|first=Josh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statues were situated in multiple waves from 2014 to 2016 and include [[Ted Kennedy (ice hockey)|Ted Kennedy]], [[Johnny Bower]], [[Darryl Sittler]], [[Börje Salming|Borje Salming]], [[Syl Apps]], [[George Armstrong (ice hockey)|George Armstrong]], [[Mats Sundin]], [[Dave Keon]], [[Turk Broda]], and [[Tim Horton]].

On August 29, 2017, it was announced that the Air Canada Centre would be renamed Scotiabank Arena on July 1, 2018. The landmark 20-year sponsorship agreement between Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment and [[Scotiabank]] is worth about C$800 million. This is believed to be the highest-priced annual building and team sponsorship in North American sports history.&lt;ref name="MLSEScotiaBankArena"&gt;{{cite news|title=HOME OF THE MAPLE LEAFS AND RAPTORS TO BECOME SCOTIABANK ARENA NEXT SUMMER|url=http://mlse.com/news/scotiabankarena/|publisher=[[Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment]]|date=August 29, 2017|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WestheadTSN"&gt;{{cite news|last=Westhead|first=Rick|title=MLSE agrees to record arena rights deal with Scotiabank|url=https://www.tsn.ca/talent/mlse-agrees-to-record-arena-rights-deal-with-scotiabank-1.842133|website=[[The Sports Network|TSN]]|date=August 29, 2017|accessdate=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arena is the third in Canada to bear naming rights to Scotiabank.

{{main|Maple Leaf Square}}
In late 2005, Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment announced that they would be renovating the western side of the Air Canada Centre during the 2008 off-season to connect it with the [[Maple Leaf Square]] development. Maple Leaf Square is jointly owned by MLSE, [[Cadillac Fairview]] and Lantera Developments. The $500 million development includes two restaurants, Hotel Le Germain at Maple Leaf Square boutique hotel, extensive retail shopping, including a {{convert|840|m2|sqft|adj=on}} Leafs, [[Toronto Marlies|Marlies]], Raptors, and [[Toronto FC]] store, two 54-storey condominiums, a [[Longo's]] supermarket, and a public square. It opened in 2010. The two-year, $48 million renovation of the ACC added a new atrium that includes a High-Definition broadcast studio for [[Leafs Nation Network]] (formerly Leafs TV), [[NBA TV Canada]] and [[GolTV (Canada)|GolTV Canada]].

The outside wall of the atrium features a {{convert|9.1|by|15.2|m|ft|adj=on}} video screen overlooking the plaza, which often broadcasts games taking place inside the arena. During [[Stanley Cup playoffs|NHL]] and [[NBA playoffs|NBA playoff]] runs, the square attracts thousands of Leafs and Raptors fans, respectively, sometimes broadcasting away playoff matches featuring the Leafs and/or the Raptors as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air Canada Centre Re-Opens Bigger And Better After Summer Hiatus|url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/accexpansion_presser_091109.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com/Raptors|date=September 11, 2009|accessdate=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A section of the square is designated Ford Fan Zone at Maple Leaf Square, with naming rights given to the [[Ford Motor Company of Canada]]. During Raptors playoff runs, the square has acquired the nickname "[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]" after the 1993 film adaptation that inspired the team's name.

The first Maple Leafs home game took place on February 20, 1999, versus the [[Montreal Canadiens]], won by the Leafs 3–2 on an [[overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]] goal by [[Steve Thomas (ice hockey)|Steve Thomas]]. Maple Leaf home games are generally sold out,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Cheryl|title=Toronto Maple Leafs|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/toronto-maple-leafs/#h3_jump_10|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and despite their lack of appearances in NHL playoffs and the Stanley Cup, there is a waitlist since the start of 2015 for Season Ticket Holders for upcoming seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Purchase Season Seats|url=http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=73129|website=Toronto Maple Leafs|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Raptors game took place the following night versus the then-[[Memphis Grizzlies|Vancouver Grizzlies]]. The Raptors won 102–87 in front of a sell-out crowd. The facility hosted the [[2000 National Hockey League All-Star Game|2000 NHL All-Star Game]], the championship game of the [[2004 World Cup of Hockey]], all games of the [[2016 World Cup of Hockey]] and the [[2016 NBA All-Star Game]], the first NBA All-Star Game held outside of the United States.

The Toronto Rock also moved to the Air Canada Centre from Maple Leaf Gardens for the [[2001 NLL season]]. The Rock's first game was a 17–7 win over the [[Ottawa Rebel]] on December 21, 2000.

On October 3, 2003, Air Canada Centre had a power outage during the third quarter of a Raptors pre-season game against the Athens-based club [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]]. The game was called final, because the power was not restored in time and the Raptors already had a [[Mercy rule|30-point lead]].

Air Canada Centre hosted the [[2015 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]] for the first time, as well as hosted the final match of that tournament, in which Canada was crowned champion, defeating Russia. The ACC co-hosted that tournament with [[Bell Centre]] in Montreal, and both venues co-hosted the [[2017 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|2017 edition of the same event]], though the ACC did not host the medal rounds.

[[File:Golf Club at Wescott Plantation (9321187216).jpg|thumb|250px|[[Golf ball]] on peg placed in the ground]]
A '''tee''' is a stand used to support a stationary [[ball]] so that the player can strike it, particularly in [[golf]], [[tee ball]], [[American football]], and [[Rugby football|rugby]].

==Etymology==
The word tee is derived from the [[Scottish Gaelic]] word ''[[wikt:taigh|taigh]]'' meaning house and is related to the 'house' (the coloured circles) in [[curling]]. This would make sense, as the first golf tees were within a ''circle'' of one [[golf club]] length round the hole. Nowadays, modern courses have separate, designated tee boxes for each hole. For example, the ninth hole of a course is played from the ninth tee to the ninth [[putting green|green]], and similarly for the other holes.

==Golf tee==
[[File:Golf tees selection.jpg|thumb|Golf tees]]
In golf, a tee is normally used for the first stroke of each hole. The area from which this first stroke is hit is in the rules&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usga.org/Rule-Books/Rules-of-Golf/Definitions/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; known as the teeing ground. Normally, teeing the ball is allowed only on the first shot of a hole, called the '''tee shot''', and is illegal for any other shot; however, local or seasonal rules may allow or require teeing for other shots as well, ''e.g.'', under "winter rules" to protect the turf when it is unusually vulnerable. Teeing gives a considerable advantage for drive shots, so it is normally done whenever allowed. However, a player may elect to play his/her tee shot without a tee. This typically gives the shot a lower trajectory.

A standard golf tee is 2.125" (two and one eighth inches = 5.4 cm) long, but both longer and shorter tees are permitted. Ordinary tees can be made from wood or from durable plastic. There are also many biodegradable, ecological and recycable golf tees that diminish the number of trees cut down to manufacture the tees and allow golf courses to lower costs by not having to deal with the broken wooden tees on their courses.

According to the R&amp;A rule book, for a tee to be legal, ''"It must not be longer than 4 inches (101.6 mm) and it must not be designed or manufactured in such a way that it could indicate the line of play or influence the movement of the ball."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randa.org/en/Equipment/Equipment-Rules.aspx#/rules/?ruleNum=1.%20Tees%20%28Rule%2011%29 R&amp;A Rules of Golf: Appendix IV, Rule 11]. Retrieved on 2012-08-14&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The development of the tee was the last major change to the [[rules of golf]]. Before this, [[golf ball]]s were teed up on little heaps of sand that were provided in boxes. This explains the historical name ''tee boxes'' for what is today known as ''teeing ground''. 

The earliest golf tees rested flat on the ground and had a raised portion to prop up the ball. The first [[patent]] for this kind of tee is dated 1889, and was issued to Scotsmen William Bloxsom and Arthur Douglas.&lt;ref name=valenta&gt;Valenta, Irwin R. ''The Singular History of the Golf Tee'', Greensboro, North Carolina, 1995. Summary at [http://www.scottishgolfhistory.net/tee_term.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The first known tee to pierce the ground was a rubber-topped peg sold commercially as the "Perfectum." This was patented in 1892 by Percy Ellis of England.&lt;ref name=valenta/&gt; In 1899, an African-American dentist, Dr. [[George Franklin Grant]], obtained a patent for an "improved golf tee".&lt;ref&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blgolfteehtm.htm George Grant - Improved Golf Tee], Mary Bellis, inventors.about.com.&lt;/ref&gt; This tee consisted of a wood cone with a rubber sleeve to support the ball, but it is not known to have ever been marketed.

&lt;/gallery&gt;



These and other variations failed to catch on, as most golfers—whether because of tradition, habit, or concerns about the rules—continued using heaps of sand. It took a strong marketing effort by Dr. [[William Lowell, Sr.]] in the 1920s to bring manufactured tees into widespread use. Sales of his "Reddy Tee," a simple wooden peg with a flared top, took off after Lowell hired professional golfers [[Walter Hagen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hyman|first=Vicki|title=A look at the man who invented modern golf tees|url=http://www.nj.com/insidejersey/index.ssf/2010/07/how_new_jersey_saved_civilizat_18.html|work=July 31, 2010|publisher=The Star-Ledger|accessdate=May 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joe Kirkwood, Sr.]] to promote the product during exhibition matches. It was copied around the world, and remains the most common type of golf tee.

==Tee Ball tee==
[[Tee Ball]] is based on [[baseball]], with the main difference being the use of a tee in the place of a [[pitcher]]. Much larger than a golf tee, the Tee Ball tee is a rubber stand attached to the [[home plate]] which supports the baseball at a suitable height for the [[batter (baseball)|batter]] to hit. It is adjustable to allow for variations in batter height.

==Kicking tee==
[[File:Super League XVI match ball.jpg|thumb|A [[rugby league]] ball on a kicking tee]]
A kicking tee is a rubber or plastic platform, often with prongs and/or a brim around an inner depression.

In [[American football]] and its variants, a tee may be used on [[Kickoff (American football)|kickoff]]s to raise the ball slightly above the playing surface (up to one inch, by [[NFL]] and [[College football|NCAA]] rules). First use of the tee is attributed to Arda Bowser, a member of the Canton Bulldogs NFL championship team of 1922.  The [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] and some high school leagues also allow the use of tees on [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] and [[extra point]] kicks, where another player (the holder) places one end of the ball on the tee (usually just a rubber block) and holds the opposite end.

Tees may also be used for [[place kick]]s in [[Rugby league|rugby league football]] and [[Rugby union|rugby union football]].

== Guinness World Record ==
The largest golf tee in the world was created by Jim Bolin in [[Casey, Illinois]], USA. It measures at 9.37 m (30 ft 9 in) long with a head diameter of 1.91 m (6 ft 3 in) and a shaft width of 64 cm (2 ft 1 in).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-golf-tee|title=Largest golf tee|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Yates v. United States''''', 574 U.S. ___ (2015), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court construed 18 [[United States Code|U.S.C.]] § 1519, a provision added to the federal criminal code by the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] to criminalize the destruction or concealment of "any record, document, or tangible object" to obstruct a federal investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|18|1519}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By a 5-to-4 vote, the Court stated that the term "tangible object" as used in this section means an object used to record or preserve information, and that this did not include fish.&lt;ref name="slip-opinion"&gt;''Yates v. United States'', {{ussc|volume=574|year=2015|docket=13-7451}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Petitioner John L. Yates, a [[commercial fishing|commercial fisherman]], was operating in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] when a federal agent conducted an offshore inspection and found that the ship's catch had undersized [[red grouper]], in violation of United States federal conservation regulations. The federal agent instructed Captain Yates to keep the undersized fish segregated; Yates instructed his crew to throw the undersized fish overboard, resulting in Yates being charged under 18 [[United States Code]] §1519. This provision, originating from the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002]], states that a person may be fined or imprisoned for up to 20 years if the person "knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence" a federal investigation.&lt;ref name="slip-opinion" /&gt;

At trial, Yates sought an acquittal for the §1519 charge arguing that fish were not tangible objects related to record-keeping. The District Court denied the acquittal motion. Yates was found guilty by a jury of violating §1519 and sentenced to 30 days' imprisonment. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] affirmed the conviction, holding that fish have a physical form and are therefore a tangible object under a dictionary definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Yates |vol=733 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1059 |pinpoint= |court=[[11th Cir.]] |date=2013 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20130816054 |accessdate=2018-11-02 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opinion of the Court ==
[[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Associate Justice]] [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] authored the plurality opinion, joined by [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] and Justices [[Stephen Breyer]] and [[Sonia Sotomayor]], holding that "within §1519's compass," a tangible object is "one used to record or preserve information."&lt;ref name="slip-opinion" /&gt; Among other things, the plurality relied upon traditional [[canons of statutory construction]] including the canons ''[[wikt:noscitur a sociis|noscitur a sociis]]'' ("a word is known by the company it keeps") and ''[[wikt:ejusdem generis|ejusdem generis]]'' ("general words following a list of specific words should usually be read in light of those specific words"), as well as the section's enactment as part of a statute dealing with financial fraud and its location within title 18.

Associate Justice [[Samuel Alito]] filed a separate opinion concurring in the judgment.

=== Dissent ===
Associate Justice [[Elena Kagan]], joined by Justices [[Antonin Scalia]], [[Anthony Kennedy]], and [[Clarence Thomas]], dissented. Justice Kagan concluded that a tangible object is "any object capable of being touched."&lt;ref name="slip-opinion" /&gt;{{rp|28}} Citing the [[United States Code]] and other U.S. laws, Kagan argued that tangible object "invariably covers physical objects of all
kinds" and that the surrounding language of §1519 makes it clear that [[United States Congress|Congress]] "meant the term to have a wide range."&lt;ref name="slip-opinion" /&gt;{{rp|28}}

The dissenting opinion suggests that the plurality opinion acknowledges that a tangible object is "a discrete thing that possesses physical form."&lt;ref name="slip-opinion" /&gt;{{rp|29}} Kagan continues this line of argument by holding that a fish "is, of course, a discrete thing that possesses physical form," citing [[Dr. Seuss]]'s book ''[[One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish]]'' (1960) as general evidence. Kagan's view is that under the "ordinary meaning of the term," a tangible object in §1519 covers fish (including undersized red grouper).&lt;ref name="slip-opinion" /&gt;{{rp|29}}
