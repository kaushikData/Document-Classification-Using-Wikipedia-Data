      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14834">The '''Association for Asian Studies''' ('''AAS''') is a scholarly, non-political and non-profit professional association open to all persons interested in Asia and the [[Asian studies|study of Asia]]. It is based in [[Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]], [[United States]]. With approximately 8,000 members worldwide, from all the regions and countries of Asia and across academic disciplines, the AAS is the largest organization focussing on Asian studies.

The Association provides members with an Annual Conference (a large conference of 3,000+ normally based in [[North America]] each spring), publications, regional conferences, and other activities. The AAS is a member of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] and participates with its sister societies in a wide range of activities, including joint participation in research and informational exchanges.

==History==
Shortly after World War One the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) with the support of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]],  had given [[Mortimer Graves]] a mandate to develop Chinese studies. [[Kenneth Scott Latourette]] recalled in 1955 that at that earlier time the "people of the United States and those who led them knew little of the peoples and cultures of the Far East," and that this was true "in spite of political, commercial and cultural commitments in the region and of events which already were hurrying them on into ever more intimate relations."{{sfnb|Latourette|1955| p =5 }} Graves worked with  [[Arthur W. Hummel, Sr.]] of the Oriental Division of the Library of Congress, the [[Institute of Pacific Relations]], the [[Harvard-Yenching Institute]], the [[American Oriental Society]], as well as with colleges, universities, and museums. Twenty-eight people attended the first meeting of this planning group, which was held at the Harvard Club in New York in 1928, and further meetings were held over the next decade. In 1936, the ''Far Eastern Bibliography'' appeared and in June 1941 ''[[The Far Eastern Quarterly]]'' issued its first number as an organ of the Far Eastern Association.{{sfnb|Pritchard|1963|p = 514}}

After the war, an organizational meeting of some 200 people was held at [[Columbia University]] April 2, 1948, following the annual meeting of the [[American Oriental Society]], to which many of the Far Eastern group belonged. {{sfnb|Pritchard |1963|p = 517-518}} The first president of the Association was [[Arthur W. Hummel, Sr.]] In 1956, the organization was renamed to the Association for Asian Studies to expand its scope to cover all areas of Asia, including South and Southeast Asia.{{sfnb|Pritchard|1963|p = 520 }} Attendance grew from 200 for the organizational meeting in 1948 to 605 at the first annual meeting in 1949 and to 2,434 in 1963.{{sfnb|Pritchard |1963|p = 522}}

The organization was further restructured in 1970, when four elective area Councils were formed, representative of each of the four areas of Asia—[[South Asia]] (SAC), [[Southeast Asia]] (SEAC), [[China]] and [[Inner Asia]] (CIAC) and [[Northeast Asia]] (NEAC). These councils were formed so that each area of Asia could have a proportionate voice in the Association and on the Board of Directors. In 1977, a Council of Conferences (COC) was established in order to coordinate the regional conferences held by the Association, and also to discover ways to better serve the needs of Asian Studies scholars in various parts of the United States. Area library organizations have been formed for South Asia ([[CONSALD]]), [[South East Asia]], and [[East Asia]] (CEAL).

==Background and controversies==
World War II brought many academics into the government, some in the active military and some in the [[Office of War Information]] or the [[Office of Strategic Services]], both of which were intelligence agencies which used academic disciplines and scholarly forms of analysis. When the war was over, political scientists, historians, and social scientists continued to be concerned with contemporary affairs. The Far Eastern Association reflected an [[Area studies]] approach, that is,  geographically grounded division of labor rather than by academic discipline, with the association sub-divided into East Asian, Southeast Asian, and South Asian Studies. (In the late 20th century, the field of Central and Inner Asia was added.) The [[Ford Foundation]] provided money and coordination to area studies centers, which in turn supported the AAS.{{sfnb|Berger|2003|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=qI_JKWha934C&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=Association+for+Asian+Studies+Cold+War&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BNn8VIrYI4S8yQTrlIHwDA&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Association%20for%20Asian%20Studies%20Cold%20War&amp;f=false 95-97]}}


Some members were critical. [[Bruce Cumings]], writing in the ''[[Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars]]'', charged that for the AAS to participate in this way of funding scholarship on Asia led to confusing academic research and government intelligence work. He further argued that the Areas Studies approach in general emphasized contemporary social science theory not the classic approaches of Oriental studies, which used philology and studied ancient civilizations. Cumings called this an "implicit Faustian bargain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | last = Cumings |first = Bruce | year = 1997 | title = Boundary Displacement: Area Studies and International Studies After the Cold War | journal = Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars | url  = http://criticalasianstudies.org/assets/files/bcas/v29n01.pdf |p= 8| volume = 29 | ref = none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, some members agitated for the AAS to express [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opposition to American involvement in Vietnam]]. AAS President [[Wm Theodore de Bary]] called for the organization to take a position on the war that was "nonpolitical but not unconcerned". The active opposition to the war was left to the much smaller [[Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars]].{{sfnb|Berger| 2003| p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=qI_JKWha934C&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=Association+for+Asian+Studies+Cold+War&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BNn8VIrYI4S8yQTrlIHwDA&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Association%20for%20Asian%20Studies%20Cold%20War&amp;f=false  97]}}

==Annual Conference==
Each spring, the Association for Asian Studies (AAS) holds a four-day conference devoted to planned programs of scholarly papers, roundtable discussions, workshops, and panel sessions on a wide range of issues in research and teaching, and on Asian affairs in general. The 2013 Conference was held in San Diego; Philadelphia (March 27–30, 2014); Chicago (March 26–29, 2015); Seattle (March 31–April 3, 2016); Toronto (March 16–19, 2017); Washington, D.C (March 22–25, 2018).

==Publications==
*''The Bibliography of Asian Studies'': Now an online database, the BAS is the single largest record of research and scholarly literature on East, Southeast, and South Asia written in Western languages. It comprises over 800,000 citations and can be electronically searched. Started as an annual section of the ''Far Eastern Quarterly'' edited by members in 1941, the BAS grew to an annual supplement produced by a specialized professional staff. However, by the mid-1980s, gathering the burgeoning data and printing the increasingly thick volumes led to the annual editions falling several years behind. The Association determined to transfer BAS to an electronic database, incorporating all entries from the print volumes for the years 1971 to 1991 and entering new citations from 1991 onward.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asian-studies.org/Publications/BAS The Bibliography of Asian Studies] &lt;/ref&gt;
*''Key Issues in Asian Studies'': designed for use in undergraduate humanities and social science courses, as well as by advanced high-school students and teachers, and anyone with an interest in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.asian-studies.org/Publications/KIAS Key Issues in Asian Studies]'' &lt;/ref&gt;
*''Asia Past and Present'': a scholarly monograph series covering all countries of Asia and all disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.asian-studies.org/Publications/APP Asia Past and Present]'' &lt;/ref&gt;
*''The Journal of Asian Studies'':  ''[[The Journal of Asian Studies]]'' has been published quarterly since 1941, when it was founded as ''The Far Eastern Quarterly''. ''JAS'' publishes multidisciplinary work on Asia, spanning the arts, history, literature, the social sciences, and cultural studies.
* ''Education About Asia'': ''[[Education About Asia]]'' (EAA) is a journal published three times a year which contains scholarly articles and practical teaching resources for secondary school, college, and university instructors, as well as for students, scholars, libraries, and others with an interest in Asia. Topics include anthropology, Asian studies, business and economics, education, geography, government, history, language and literature, political science, religion, and sociology. The complete run of the journal was put online for free access in 2014 &lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.asian-studies.org/EAA/index.htm Education About Asia]'' &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cannabis in Albania''' is illegal, but the drug is widely cultivated.

[[File:Lazarat.jpg|420px|thumb|right|Lazarat, a town where many people make living off of cannabis{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}]]

==Trafficking==
Drug trafficking first became a major concern in Albania in the 1990s; in that same period cannabis cultivation which had initially been concentrated in the south became more widespread. Albanian cannabis production is sufficient to meet local demand and also export to other areas, though the country continues to import some hashish through Turkey.&lt;ref name="FijnautPaoli2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cyrille Fijnaut|author2=Letizia Paoli|title=Organised Crime in Europe: Concepts, Patterns and Control Policies in the European Union and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-XtKAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA553|date=21 January 2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-2765-9|pages=553–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the mid-2000s, 77% of the cannabis in Italy originated in Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=2006 World Drug Report: Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lk8wDdoxTZsC&amp;pg=PA2095|date=1 January 2006|publisher=United Nations Publications|isbn=978-92-1-148214-0|pages=2095–}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 report, however, noticed a reduction in the significance of Albanian cannabis exports, and that seizures of Albanian herbal cannabis had "become very rare in the last five years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Drug Report 2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H2iL-nJlVmgC&amp;pg=PA96|date=30 June 2009|publisher=United Nations Publications|isbn=978-92-1-148240-9|pages=96–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

More recently, although still undoubtedly a net exporter, Albanians have begun importing herbal cannabis as well, with an apparent preference for the hashish varieties of the Maghreb. Total production, meanwhile, in Albania, was estimated by Italian financial police to be around 900 tonnes, worth about 4.5 billion euros.&lt;ref name="LazaratReport"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sensiseeds.com/en/blog/cannabis-in-albania/|title="Cannabis in Albania"|date=29 October 2013|accessdate= 25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==
In 2012, Albania seized 21.2 metric tons of cannabis, nearly twice the amount seized in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Besar Likmeta |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/report-cannabis-growth-mounts-in-albania |title=Report Says Albania Cannabis Growth Mounting |publisher=Balkan Insight |date= |accessdate=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albania made global headlines and "placed itself on the cannabis map" in 2013 when the [[Albanian State Police]] (ASP) tried to shut down production in [[Lazarat]], one of the heaviest producing towns in the mountainous southern regions that are said to be the "heartland" of Albanian cannabis production. Lazarat's villages, 90% of whom are thought to be involved in the cannabis trade in some way, mounted an armed resistance against the ASP with even a "70-year old grandmother" involved in the fighting. &lt;ref name="LazaratReport"/&gt;

==History==
It was right after the fall of [[Communism in Albania|its communist state]] that the current large production of cannabis began in Albania. In 1991, criminal groups from Greece began to establish cannabis plantations in southern areas near the Greek border, and the local Albanian farmers embraced an opportunity for some level of financial stability in the turbulent economic situation. In the early days of cannabis production in Albania, trafficking was done by Greek youths who carried bags of cannabis over the mountains across the border, in which Albanian law enforcement found it difficult to control the trade. The new industry took hold quickly despite attempts to curtail it, and it has been reported that in 1995 gunfights between farmers and police were common. Later on, the trade became linked to the Italian mafia, and cannabis was carried to Italy on speedboats going over the Ionian Sea. &lt;ref name="LazaratReport"/&gt;

Due to its aspirations to join the [[European Union]], Albania is under pressure to present a decisive national anti-drug strategy, and in recent years has escalated police crackdown against the cannabis trade, with mixed results, and coordinating efforts with other national governments such as the Italian government. &lt;ref name="LazaratReport"/&gt;

The '''Committee on Alleged German Outrages''', often called the '''Bryce Report''' after its chair, Viscount [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]] (1838–1922), is best known for producing the "Report of the Committee on Alleged German Outrages," published on 12 May 1915. The report is seen as a major propaganda form that Britain used in order to educate the world on the behaviour of Germany, which had invaded Belgium the year before.

The Report was translated by the end of 1915 into every major European language and had a profound impact on public opinion in Allied and neutral countries, particularly in the United States. The eyewitness testimony published in its 320-page Appendix A included some sensationalist accounts of mutilations and rapes for which there is no other evidence.  These invented atrocities stigmatized the Report and have made it a target for revisionist historians and writers on propaganda.

==History==
By the middle of September 1914, the Belgian Government had issued three reports on German war crimes committed during the invasion of the country, and there were calls in the British Parliament and the Press for a British commission to conduct its own inquiry. Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] responded on 15 September by authorizing the [[Home Secretary]] and the [[Attorney General#England and Wales|Attorney General]] to investigate allegations of violations of the laws of war by the German Army.  In the end, some 1,200 witnesses were interviewed by teams of barristers appointed by [[George A. Aitken]], Assistant Home Secretary, who directed the investigation, and by clerks in the Attorney General’s Office.  Most of the witnesses were Belgian refugees; nearly two million Belgians had fled the country, and over 120,000 found refuge in the UK.

[[File:James Bryce.jpg|thumb|James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce]] 
On 4 December [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]] was asked to chair the "German Outrages Inquiry Committee", which would review the material that had been collected and issue a report. The mission of this committee was to review the "charges that German soldiers, either directed or condoned by their officers, had been guilty of widespread atrocities in Belgium."&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Wilson | first = Trevor  | author-link =  | last2 =  | first2 =  | author2-link =  | title = Lord Bryce’s Investigation into Alleged German Atrocities in Belgium, 1914-15 | journal = Journal of Contemporary History | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 369–383 | date = July 1979 | url =  | doi =  10.1177/002200947901400301| id = | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryce asked if he would have a chance to interview witnesses, but was told that would not be necessary. The Britannic Majesty’s Government appointed some of their most notable citizens to be a part of the committee: [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]] who was a British ambassador to the United States, [[H.A.L Fisher]] a well-known Liberal historian, [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Sir Frederick Pollock]] who was a famous judge and legal historian, and [[Harold Cox]], the ''Edinburgh Review'' editor, and two lawyers, Sir Edward Clark and Sir Alfred Hopkinson.

Viscount Bryce was an inspired choice to chair the committee. He was a Gladstonian [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] who had opposed the [[Boer War]] and had sought accommodation with Germany until the invasion of Belgium. He also had a substantial reputation as a scholar, having studied at [[Heidelberg]], had made his scholarly reputation with a book on the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and had been awarded honorary doctorates by the universities of [[Jena]] and [[Leipzig]] in addition to the ''[[Pour le Mérite]]''. Still more important for the government, Bryce was a respected figure in both Britain and the United States, where he had been the British ambassador from 1907–1913, and was a friend of [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]]. He had written an important work on the political system in the U.S., ''The American Commonwealth'', had traveled widely in the country, and had many admirers among American politicians and intellectuals.  His imprimatur guaranteed that the report would be widely read.  In public statements and private correspondence, Bryce claimed that he hoped to exonerate the German Army from accusations of barbarism.&lt;ref name=lipkes&gt;{{cite book | last = Lipkes | first = Jeff | authorlink = | title = Rehearsals: The German Army in Belgium, August 1914| publisher = Leuven University Press| year = 2007 | location = | pages = 689–683 | url = | isbn = 90-5867-596-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bryce was also known for his sympathy towards the German people and their culture.&lt;ref name=horne1&gt;{{cite book | last = Horne | first = John | authorlink = |author2=Alan Kramer| title = German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial| publisher = Yale University Press| year = 2001 | location = London| pages = 232–237 | url = | isbn = 0-300-08975-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By selecting Bryce to be head of the committee, it was believed that the research and findings completed would be reviewed with extreme care and that it would hold the guilty responsible for their actions.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;

===Membership===
The membership of the Committee incorporated many important individuals of British and international status, including Sir [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Frederick Pollock]], Sir [[Edward George Clarke|Edward Clarke]], Sir [[Alfred Hopkinson]], Sir [[Kenelm Edward Digby|Kenelm E. Digby]], Mr. [[H. A. L. Fisher]], and Mr. [[Harold Cox]].

===Conflict within the Committee===
By the beginning of March 1915, Harold Cox began to have reservations about some of the depositions and about the limited role the Committee was playing in the investigation.  He wanted the members to re-interview some of the witnesses, and threatened to resign if his request was not met.  Bryce agreed to rewrite the Report’s preface to more clearly explain that the Committee was simply evaluating statements submitted by others and he agreed to permit Cox to reject any deposition he found suspect.  Cox had written: "...at the very least we ought to take the precaution of examining the barristers and other persons who have taken depositions," and this request Bryce also granted.  He convinced Cox, however, that it would not be practical to re-interview witnesses, and the editor and former M.P. remained on the Committee.&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;Oxford University, Bodleian Library Bryce Papers, 247-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee reportedly examined 1,200 witnesses, 500 of whose statements were incorporated in the report, along with excerpts from 37 personal diaries found on dead German soldiers, some of whom were officers. Many of the accounts in the final report had previously been published in newspaper stories or in official accounts released by the Belgian government, but they were given renewed credibility by the British committee.

Depositions were collected by a team of English barristers, assigned solely for the purpose of collecting witness accounts for the committee. The committee stressed the need for reliable sources, so that its findings would be both credible and truthful. The committee was unwilling to mention [[Wiktionary:atrocity|atrocity]] tales in fear of releasing inaccurate and biased stories as fact. As a result, the committee states within the Bryce Report that "many depositions have thus been omitted on which, although they are probably true, we think it safer not to place reliance.&lt;ref name="gwpda.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwpda.org/wwi-www/BryceReport/bryce_r.html|title=The Bryce Report, 1914|work=gwpda.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; By removing the extreme witness accounts from its report, the committee believed it had "eliminated utterly unreliable and unsupported statements."&lt;ref name=read&gt;{{cite book | last = Read| first = James Morgan| authorlink = | title = [[Wiktionary:atrocity|atrocity]] propaganda, 1914-1919| publisher = Yale University Press| year = 1941| location = New Haven| nopp =  | pages = 204–207| url = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To stress the importance of a truthful report, the Committee on Alleged German Outrages used a professional process to investigate the war crimes the German army was accused of. To make sure the report maintained a professional level, the committee wrote its findings in legal terms. Once these depositions were completely analyzed, the original depositions were stored at the British Home Office for protection.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;

==Findings of the Committee==
The ''Report of the Committee on Alleged German Outrages'', more commonly known as the ''Bryce Report'', was a 61-page document issued on 12 May 1915.

===The Report===
The British Home Office collected a vast amount of "evidence" from civilians whose villages were attacked by German troops, British officers, German soldier diaries, and other firsthand accounts. The evidence against the German soldiers verified their inhumane acts of violence.

The Report was divided into two parts:
* Part I, "The Conduct of the German Troops in Belgium" consists of descriptions and summaries of war crimes in six regions:   "[[Liège]] and District," "Valleys of [[Meuse]] and [[Sambre]]," "The Aerschot ([[Aarschot]]), Malines ([[Mechelen]]), Vilvorde ([[Vilvoorde]]), and Louvain ([[Leuven]]) Quadrangle," "Louvain (Leuven) and District," "Termonde" ([[Dendermonde]]), and "Alost" ([[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]]).

Belgium was guaranteed by a Treaty in 1839, that no nation was to have the right to claim the passage for its army through a neutral state. The treaty was in the case that Germany and France might enter a war between each other.

The Belgian Minister in 1911 requested from Germany that she would respect the Treaty of 1839.  Germany’s response to the request was, "Belgian neutrality is provided for by international conventions and Germany is determined to respect those conventions."&lt;ref name="gwpda.org"/&gt;

The German Minister, Herr von Below, on 2 August 1914 presented Belgium with a note where they demanded with an instant declaration of war that they were allowed passage through Belgium.

The King of Belgium with concern for his civilians was reluctant to agree to Germany’s request. But on the evening of 3 August, German troops crossed through Belgium territory. Belgian civilians were startled by the attacks, and German troops did not expect a difficult passage

 
*Part II is divided into two sections summarizing "Treatment of Civilian Population" and "Offences Against Combatants."
After having "narrated the offenses committed in Belgium, which it has been proper to consider as a whole, we now turn to another branch of the subject, the breaches of the usages of war which appear in the conduct of the German army general."&lt;ref name="gwpda.org"/&gt;

A one-page Conclusion follows.

The Report came to four conclusions about the behavior of the German Army:
*"That there were in many parts of Belgium deliberate and systematically organized massacres of the civil population, accompanied by many isolated murders and other outrages."
*“That in the conduct of the war generally innocent civilians, both men and women, were murdered in large numbers, women violated, and children murdered."
*“That looting, house burning, and the wanton destruction of property were ordered and countenanced by the officers of the German Army, that elaborate provisions had been made for systematic incendiarism at the very outbreak of the war, and that the burnings and destruction were frequent where no military necessity could be alleged, being indeed part of a system of general terrorism.”
*“That the rules and usages in of war were frequently broken, particularly by the using of civilians, including woman and children, as a shield for advancing forces exposed to the fire, to a lesser degree by killing the wounded and prisoners, and in the frequent abuse of the Red Cross and the White Flag."&lt;ref name="gwpda.org"/&gt;

The Committee determined that "these excesses were committed – in some cases ordered, in others allowed – on a system and in pursuance of a set purpose.  That purpose was to strike terror into the civil population and dishearten the Belgian troops, so as to crush down resistance and extinguish the very spirit of self-defence.  The pretext that civilians had fired upon the invading troops was used to justify not merely the shooting of individual francs-tireurs, but the murder of large numbers of innocent civilians, an act absolutely forbidden by the rules of civilised warfare."

The Committee sought to exonerate certain individuals.  German peasants "are as kindly and good-natured as any people in Europe.  But for Prussian officers, war seems to have become a sort of sacred mission...  The Spirit of War is deified.  Obedience to the State and its War Lord leaves no room for any other duty or feeling.  Cruelty becomes legitimate when it promises victory."&lt;ref name=Bryce&gt;p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The committee made an important note that this report was investigating the actions of the German army and that the German people should not be blamed for the crimes of their national army. This careful investigation of all 1,200 depositions created the belief that the term ‘atrocity’ should be directly connected with the German army, due to the army's extreme practice of militarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last =  | first =  | author-link =  | last2 =  | first2 =  | author2-link =  | title = The Bryce Report | journal = [[The Nation]] | volume = 100 | issue = 2603 | pages =  | date = 20 May 1915 | url =  | doi =  | id = | postscript =  . }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is confirmed by the German diaries, which showed the German account of the war crimes in Belgium was directly ordered by commanding army officers. In its final conclusion, the committee claimed that the militarism of the German army was the cause of the outrages in Belgium.&lt;ref name=horne&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Horne | first = John | author-link =  | last2 = Kramer | first2 = Alan | author2-link =  | title = German "Atrocities" and Franco-German Opinion, 1914: The Evidence of German Soldiers' Diaries | journal = [[The Journal of Modern History]] | volume = 66 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–33 | date = March 1994 | url =  | doi =  10.1086/244776| id = | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution===
The Report was widely accepted throughout the world, translated into more than 30 languages and widely circulated by British propaganda services, especially in the USA, where it was reprinted and circulated in most of the US national newspapers, including ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=John&gt;{{Cite journal | last =  | first =  | author-link =  | last2 =  | first2 =  | author2-link =  | title = The Bryce Report on German Atrocities | journal = [[Literary Digest]] | volume = 50 | issue = 22 | pages =  | date = 29 May 1915 | url =  | doi =  | id = | postscript =  . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of Report==
On 27 May 1915 it was reported that every New York newspaper had reprinted the Bryce Report. Charles Masterman, head of the British War Propaganda Bureau at [[Wellington House]], had 41,000 copies shipped to the US. The same month the German government attempted to combat the report with the publication of its own reports on atrocities committed against German soldiers by Belgian civilians. It offered depositions and eyewitness accounts but had little impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Quinn | first = Patrick J. | authorlink = | title = The Conning of America: The Great War and American Popular Literature | publisher = Rodopi | year = 2001 | location =  | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 90-420-1475-X| page = 39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Committee on Public Information]] urged US newspapers not to publish stories that might undermine the Bryce Report. A column titled "The Daily German Lie" linked support for the Report's authenticity to a [[United States Department of War|War Department]] request for a ban on printing unsubstantiated [[Wiktionary:atrocity|atrocity]] stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sweeney | first = Michael S. | authorlink = | title = The Military and the Press: An Uneasy Truce | publisher = Northwestern University Press | year = 2006 | location =  | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8101-2299-5| page = 49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The findings of the committee became a major piece of British propaganda used to convince Americans to join the war.  The committee’s report proved the atrocities in Belgium were committed under German militarism, which left neutral countries to draw their own conclusions of how to view the German army. But, based on their own conclusions, most neutral countries, especially the United States, came to connect the German army with the term ‘atrocity’ during World War I.  "By identifying German army conduct with militarism, the Bryce Report made opposition to the German army the same as opposition to war itself."&lt;ref name=horne/&gt;  Because the Bryce Report was considered a credible source, it was cited throughout national newspapers.  ''The New York Times'' reported that the committee was "set to answer the question, ‘Were there German atrocities in Belgium?’ and they have answered it. They have made further disputes impossible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last =  | first =  | author-link =  | last2 =  | first2 =  | author2-link =  | title = Topics of the Times: Truly a Tale Unadorned | newspaper=The New York Times | pages =  | date = 14 May 1915 | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/05/14/101926827.pdf | postscript =  . | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The American public believed that the committee had made credible arguments against the German army.

===Criticism===
German authorities in response to the Bryce Report published the [[The German White Book|White Book]] five days later.{{clarify|date=January 2017|reason=Bryce report supposedly published 12 May 1915, while Germany published Das Deutsche Weissbuch (sources vary from August 1914 to May 1915) and an official English translation for the United States thereafter; more citations for precise dates, versions and page numbers needed.}} The book contained records where Belgians were guilty of atrocities committed on German soldiers. 
*  “It has been established beyond doubt that Belgian civilians plundered, killed and even shockingly mutilated German wounded soldiers in which atrocities even women and children took part. Thus the eyes were gouged out of the German wounded soldiers, their ears, noses and finger-joints were cut off, or they were emasculated or disemboweled. In other cases German soldiers were poisoned or strung up on trees; hot liquid was poured over them, or they were otherwise burned so that they died under terrible tortures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/FWWatrocities.htm|title=Atrocities in the First World War|publisher=Spartacus Educational Publishers Ltd.|accessdate=23 January 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702171154/http://spartacus-educational.com/FWWatrocities.htm|archivedate=2 July 2014|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after World War I, the original documents of the Belgian witness depositions could not be found in the British Home Office, where they were supposed to be kept for protection. This prevented others from questioning and investigating the depositions to test whether the Bryce Report was true.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;  The Committee on Alleged German Outrages had no direct part in collecting the depositions of the witnesses. The majority of the depositions that were obtained for the Bryce Report were taken by English barristers (lawyers), who were not under oath.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;   The committee did not personally interview a single witness, openly and clearly stating in its preamble that it relied instead on depositions given without oaths and hearsay evidence which it considered to be independently corroborated.

Objections were made to the timing of its release, to the fact that the testimony of witnesses was not given under oath and the individuals were not identified by name, and to the improbability of some of the testimony.   It was repeatedly claimed that the charges had been refuted by subsequent investigations.  The fact that the original depositions were lost was said to show bad faith.  The motives of Bryce and the other members were also questioned.  Trevor Wilson claims in particular that members believed that if they rejected the more sensationalist accusations against the German Army, involving rape and mutilation, audiences would question the more prosaic war crimes that the Army did indeed commit.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;

Among the books of the interwar period attacking the Bryce Report are Harold Laswell, ''Propaganda Techniques in the World War'' (1927), [[Arthur Ponsonby]], ''Falsehood in Wartime'' (1928), H. Grattan, ''Why We Fought'' (1928), [[Harry Elmer Barnes]], ''In Quest of Truth and Justice'' (1928), [[George Viereck]], ''Spreading Germs of Hate'' (1930), James Squires, ''British Propaganda at Home and in the United States'' (1935), H. C. Peterson, ''Propaganda for War: The Campaign Against American Neutrality, 1914-1917'' (1938) and James Read, ''Atrocity Propaganda, 1914-1919'' (1941).

Criticisms have seldom been dispassionate.  Convinced that reports of German war crimes were fabrications, revisionists have vilified Bryce and the Report for nine decades.  The latter was “in itself one of the worst atrocities of the war.”  Bryce was guilty of “an irresponsible misuse of judicial procedure that disseminated...huge untruths.”  For Bryce, “no lie was too great and no distortion too bizarre.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Peterson| first = Horace Cornelius | authorlink = | title = Propaganda for War: The Campaign Against American Neutrality, 1914-1917| publisher = University of Oklahoma Press| year = 1939 | location = | pages = 56 | url = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Messinger | first = Gary S. | authorlink = | title = British Propaganda and the State in the First World War| publisher = Manchester University Press| year = 1992 | location = | nopp =  | pages = 83–84 | url = | isbn = 0-7190-3014-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hayward | first = James | authorlink = | title = Myths and Legends of the First World War| publisher = Sutton Publishing Ltd| year = 2002 | location = | pages = 127 | url = | isbn = 0-7509-2865-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses to Criticism===
As to the specific charges made by inter-war revisionists, there is no evidence that the Report was rushed into print five days after the sinking of the ''[[Lusitania]]'' in order to capitalize on the outrage caused by that event.  When there can be no prosecution for perjury, the taking of testimony under oath is no guarantee of its reliability, as evidenced by the German White Book (which claimed the Belgian government had organized guerrilla attacks on the German Army in 1914), where most of the depositions are sworn.  The Belgian government requested that witnesses not be identified by name for fear of reprisals against relatives and friends in occupied Belgium.  Most witnesses can be identified from lists of names in the Committee’s papers in the [[The National Archives|National Archives]].

When historian [[James Morgan Read]] wished to consult the original depositions in 1939, he was told, with much embarrassment, that they were lost.  On 13 August 1942, however, the missing depositions were located.  The depositions, however, were subsequently destroyed, most likely by a German rocket.&lt;ref&gt;Lipkes, p.698&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that they were deliberately withheld from Read or intentionally destroyed.

However, the claim by revisionists that some of the testimony is not credible is entirely legitimate.  The Committee included in Appendix A depositions it should have been much more skeptical of, particularly from Belgian soldiers.  Critics repeatedly cited as the most egregious accusations a claim by a Belgian soldier that he had witnessed a mass rape in central Liège and the claim of two civilians in Mechelen that they saw a German soldier spear a child with his bayonet as he marched past.

There is a clear correlation between the unreliability of the testimony in a given town or region and the percentage of soldiers offering testimony.  In an analysis of the plausibility of testimony in Appendix A, based on other sources, Jeff Lipkes found that in the testimony about Liège and the villages to its east, the 35 depositions average 3.8 on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 represents “probably a legend or invention” and 5 represents “very likely.”  Soldiers, however, rate only 2.16, while civilians average 4.14.  The former accounted for just 17% of the depositions.  Similarly, in the section on the valleys of the Meuse and Sambre, the 30 statements by witnesses average 3.77, with civilians rating 4.04, while soldiers only average 2.4.  The soldiers again comprised a low percent of the total, 16.6%.  It is in the region designated “The Aershot, Malines, Vilvorde, Louvain Quadrangle,” where the majority of the testimony comes from soldiers, that the most dubious depositions occur.  Even within this region, testimony from townspeople tends to be reliable.  In Aarschot, the 38 depositions average 4.0.  Soldiers, 31.6% of the total, averaged only 2.4, whereas the 26 civilians rated 4.73, providing credible accounts that fully tallied with other evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Lipkes, pp. 699-700&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the claim was made repeatedly that subsequent investigations disproved the charges of the Bryce Report, this is not the case.  There was no systematic attempt to analyze the findings of the Committee, and certainly no official re-investigation.  Read, the most scholarly of the revisionists, compared eyewitness reports in three towns with the reports of the post-war Belgian Commission of Inquest.  In Mechelen and Elewijt, there are certainly some dubious allegations among the Bryce Committee witnesses.  However, the 14 reports from Aalst are almost entirely corroborated by testimony from the Belgian Commission.  Most of the slashings, stabbings, and burnings described by witnesses were likely to have taken place.&lt;ref name=Read&gt;J. Read, ''Atrocity Propaganda, 1914-1919.'' 1941. p. 207; Commission d’Enquête sur les Violations des Régles du Droit des Gens, des Lois et des Coutumes de la Guerre, ''Rapports et Documents d’Enquête'', premier vol., tome 2. 1922-3. pp. 621-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas where there were mass executions, the Bryce Report actually underestimates the killing.  In Aarschot, where 169 civilians were murdered, the report records only ten deaths.  No totals are given for Dinant, where 685 civilians were killed; however, various figures, added together, come to 410.  As for Tamines, where 383 were killed, the Report only states: “A witness describes how he saw the public square littered with corpses...”  The Committee had few witnesses to draw upon for the French-speaking regions of Belgium.  Most Walloons fled to France.

There is no evidence that Committee members felt that the graver charges would not be believed in if the more sensationalist accusations were dismissed, as Wilson claims.  However, there is no question that the Committee members exercised poor judgement in their selection of some testimony.  They reprinted 55 depositions from the small town of Hofstadt, many dubious, where fewer than ten murders occurred.  (The depositions average only 2.11 on Lipkes’s scale, with soldiers providing 85% of the testimony.)  Meanwhile, the Committee failed to investigate carefully well-documented cases of mass executions, such as [[Andenne]], Tamines, and Dinant.

==Conclusion==
Today, in light of the research by Dr Jeff Lipkes, the Committee's Report is no longer considered a "prime example of untruthful war propaganda".  Instead, its conclusions have been substantively vindicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lipkes|first1=Jeff|title=Rehearsals: The German Army in Belgium, August 1914|date=2007|publisher=Leuven University Press|location=Leuven, Belgium|isbn=9789058675965|page=696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Community health agent''' (''agente comunitário de saúde'' or ACS, in [[Portuguese language]]) is the title of a specific lay [[health care]] worker developed in [[Brazil]] by way of PACS (Program of Community Health Workers) in 1991 as part of the construction of the [[Sistema Único de Saúde|Brazilian Unified Health System]] established by [[Constitution]]al rule in 1988. 

The agent, which was said to be inspired on the [[barefoot doctor]]s program in [[China]], is not certified to practice [[medicine]] or [[nursing]], but has the primary task of gathering information on the health status of a small community by means of a close relationship with it. In the initial design, the agent should be one of the residents of a street, neighborhood or surrounding region, and was to be selected on the basis of a good relationship with his neighbors, in addition to the ability to devote eight hours a day to the work. Every agent is supervised by a [[physician|doctor]] or [[nurse]] of the health clinic, and home visits are conducted in the coverage area of a basic health unit, thus producing information that can assess the main health problems of his community.

With the proposition of the [[Brazilian Ministry of Health]] in 1994, when it created the a nationwide [[family health]] program, called PSF -- [[Programa de Saúde da Família]]—health community workers can be found in two different situations in relation to the health care system:

* Linked to a basic health unit not yet attached to the Family Health Program;
* Connected to a basic family health as a member of the [[multidisciplinary]] team.

Currently (October 2009), there are more than 260,000 community health agents present both in rural and peri-urban areas of small municipalities as well as in highly urbanized and industrialized cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datasus.gov.br DATASUS Statistical Data of Health in Brazil]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duties of the Community Health Agent==
* Encourage community organization continually;
* Participate in the life of the community primarily through the organizations, encouraging the discussion of issues relating to the improvement of life;
* Strengthen links between the community and health services;
* Inform other team members on the availability of health needs and social dynamics of the community;
* Lead the community for appropriate use of health services;
* Register [[birth]]s, [[notifiable disease]]s and [[epidemiological surveillance]] and [[death]]s;
* Register all the families of their service area;
* Identify and register all [[pregnant]] women and children from 0 to 6 years of their service area, through [[home care]];
* Integrate governmental and [[non-governmental organization]]s, groups of [[community association]]s ([[midwive]]s, mother's club, etc.).
* Carry out, within his/her level of competence, actions and basic health activities:
** Monitoring of pregnant women and nursing mothers.
** Promotion of [[breastfeeding]].
** Monitoring growth and development of children.
** Ensuring compliance with the schedule of [[vaccination]] and other vaccinations that may be necessary.
** Control of [[diarrhea|diarrheal disease]]s.
** Control of [[acute respiratory infection]] (ARI).
** Guidance on alternative [[foods]].
** Use of [[folk medicine]].
** Promoting the [[sanitation]] and improving the [[Natural environment|environment]].

The '''EFA''' or '''Engin de Franchissement de l'Avant''' (forward crossing apparatus) is a field-deployable river crossing apparatus, used by [[combat engineer]]s in the [[French Army]]. It may either be used as a [[bridge]] (deployed in a series), or as a [[ferry]].

The crew consists of four people:

* 1 head gear
* 1 driver
* 1 pilot
* 1 crewman

The EFA is the heir of the first self-propelled bridging vehicle invented in 1955 by the French military engineer and general Gillois Jean (born in Châteaubriant 1909). Tray Gillois entered service with the French army in 1965. A version modified by EWK was successively adopted by the American, British and German militaries. At the time of its introduction it was able to carry vehicles up to a maximum weight of 25 tons, the current version supports loads of about 50 tons. It takes between 45 and 65 minutes to form a bridge 100 meters long. Tray Gillois avoids the heavy and bulky convoys, barges brought in by road, which are sensitive to enemy attacks. It takes about half a day to create a 100-metre deck.

The '''flag of Goshen''' was the official flag of the short-lived South African territory of [[State of Goshen|Goshen]] from 1883 to 1885.  

==History==
The state of Goshen arose from a war in [[Bechuanaland]] in 1881-82.  It was established by a group of mercenaries who had fought in the war.  Goshen's independence was short-lived, though, as it was occupied by British forces in March 1885, and was later incorporated into [[British Bechuanaland]]. 

The executive council resolved on 5 March 1883 that the flag which they had flown during the war would be the official flag of their new state.

==Description==
The flag was evidently modelled on the 'vierkleur' [[Flag of the South African Republic]].  The official description was :
&lt;blockquote&gt;Green against the hoist, and across from it black, white and red below each other.&lt;ref name=pvw&gt; Ploeger, J. (1988).  ' Die vlag en wapen van die Republiek Land Goosen' in ''Africana Notes &amp; News'' (March 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The event is organised by the Government of Gibraltar as part of the celebrations running up to [[Gibraltar National Day]].&lt;ref name=GBC/&gt; The music festival is the largest held on [[Rock of Gibraltar|The Rock]].&lt;ref name=Olive&gt;{{cite web|title=Jessie J heads to the Rock|url=http://www.theolivepress.es/spain-news/2012/08/25/jessie-j-heads-to-the-rock/|publisher=The Olive Press|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of Gibraltar decided in 2017 to partner with [[MTV UK]] to run the festival and renamed it to ''MTV Presents Gibraltar Calling''.&lt;ref name=chronicle.gi&gt;{{cite web|title=MTV announces partnership with Gibraltar Government to host music festival|url=http://chronicle.gi/2017/01/mtv-announces-partnership-with-gibraltar-government-to-host-music-festival/|publisher=chronicle.gi|access-date=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the sale of [[Victoria Stadium (Gibraltar)|Victoria Stadium]] to the [[Gibraltar Football Association]], the future of the festival at its current venue was cast into doubt.

The '''Homelands''' are the mythical lands from [[fairy tales]], [[folklore]], and [[nursery rhymes]] in the comic book series ''[[Fables (comics)|Fables]]''.&lt;ref name="vert-ency"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Irvine | first = Alex | author-link = Alexander C.

This is a list of the Homelands that have been directly referenced in ''Fables'' and its spin-offs ''[[Jack of Fables]]'', ''[[Cinderella: From Fabletown with Love]]'', ''Cinderella: Fables are Forever'' and ''[[Fairest (comics)|Fairest]]''.

== Major lands ==

*'''[[Tuscany|Toscane]]'''&lt;ref name="F99"&gt;''Fables'' 99: ''Dark City''&lt;/ref&gt; – Also known as the Imperial Homeworld.&lt;ref name="H"&gt;''Fables: Homelands''&lt;/ref&gt; This world is [[Italy|Italian]] in nature, which can be seen in the Roman styles of architecture of '''Calabri Anagni''', the capital city of the Empire.&lt;ref name="H" /&gt; This world is home to several Italian Fables; [[The Adversary (Fables)|the Adversary]]&lt;ref name="H" /&gt; and the characters from the tale of ''[[Pinnochio]]''. Formerly the home [[Sacred grove]],&lt;ref name="H" /&gt; now located in the Kingdom of Haven.&lt;ref&gt;''Fables'' 69: ''The Good Prince'', Chapter Nine&lt;/ref&gt; When translated into Latin, ''Calabri'' refers to the Boot heel-shaped peninsula in Italy and ''[[Anagni]]'' refers to the ancient town in central Italy.
*'''The Kingdom of the Great Lion''' – A reference to [[Narnia]],&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, Jess, [[Bill Willingham|Willingham, Bill]], [[Mark Buckingham|Buckingham, Mark]] (2013). ''Fables Encyclopedia''. New York. [[DC Comics]]. {{ISBN|978-1-4012-4395-1}}. Page 240&lt;/ref&gt; It was another land that was conquered early on.&lt;ref name="F5"&gt;''Fables'' 5: ''Legends in Exile'', Chapter Five&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]'' currently being protected by copyright, the kingdom may never be officially named. The first chapter of "War And Pieces" is called "The Voyage Of The Sky Treader",&lt;ref&gt;''Fables'' 73:''War and Pieces'', Chapter One&lt;/ref&gt; which may be a reference to ''[[The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader]]'' (the 5th book in the "Narnia" series, using the internal chronology). In ''Fables'' 137 (''Camelot'', Part Six), [[List of Fables characters (New York Fables)#"The Cubs"|Winter]] refers to a book [[Snow White (Fables)|her mother]] reads to her and her siblings all the time, about a land where there is always winter, but never Christmas;&lt;ref name="Fables137"&gt;''Fables'' 137: ''Camelot'', Part 6&lt;/ref&gt; this is a reference to ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]].
*'''[[Middle-Earth]]''' –  A flashback in the ''Legends in Exile'' story arc shows short slaves ([[Hobbit]]s) being whipped by [[goblin]]s ([[orc]]s). Yet another land conquered by the Adversary.&lt;ref name="F5" /&gt;
*'''[[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliput]]''' – From ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''; It is unknown if the island of Lilliput is conquered by the Adversary, however, the first party that came from Lilliput is now living in Smalltown of [[Fabletown]]'s upstate Farm annex.&lt;ref name="F18"&gt;''Fables'' 18: ''Barleycorn Brides''&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Bornegascar''' and '''Madagao''' – From ''Fantastic Fables'' by [[Ambrose Bierce]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/374/374-h/374-h.htm |title=The Project Gutenberg eBook, ''Fantastic Fables'', by Ambrose Bierce |publisher=Project Gutenberg |date=January 17, 2007 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the rival kings managed to escape and died side by side in ''The Last Castle''.&lt;ref name="LC"&gt;''Fables: The Last Castle''&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The Kingdom of the [[List of Fables characters#The North Wind|North Wind]]''' – Also referred to as "the North".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Fables'' 110: ''Inherit the Wind'', Chapter Three&lt;/ref&gt; The lands of the North Wind were not taken, as the Adversary’s minions "knew to leave him alone".&lt;ref name="F43" /&gt; '''Foggytown''' is located in the Kingdom of the North Wind.&lt;ref&gt;''Fables'' 102: ''Super Team'', Chapter One&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The Rus''' – A mythical version of [[Russia]]&lt;ref name="F99" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;''[[Peter and Max: A Fables Novel]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and home to many [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] Fables; [[List of Fables characters#Baba Yaga|Baba Yaga]], the mice and the cat from the Russian [[lubok]] ''[[Lubok|The Mice are burying the Cat]]'',&lt;ref name="F37"&gt;''Fables'' 37: ''Homelands'', Chapter Two&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ivan the Fool|Ivan Durak]],&lt;ref name="CF"&gt;''Cinderella: Fables Are Forever''&lt;/ref&gt; all came from this world. It was controlled by Baba Yaga, until she was captured in the Battle of Fabletown. Her Knights also patrolled the lands until they were beheaded by [[Boy Blue (Fables)|Boy Blue]].&lt;ref name="F37" /&gt; [[List of Fables characters#Other Literals|Prose Page]] spent years in the Rus during her quest for knowledge in the Homelands.&lt;ref name="JOF32"&gt;''Jack of Fables 32: The Books of War'', Volume Five&lt;/ref&gt; Mundane Russia is approximately one-sixteenth the size of the magical Rus.&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;
*'''Dunhill''', '''Viss''', '''Haven''', and '''Lamien''' – The home of Lumi, the [[List of Fables characters#The Snow Queen|Snow Queen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Jack of Fables'' 6: ''Jack Frost'', Part One&lt;/ref&gt; These were not conquered, as Lumi made a deal in which she would use her powers in the Adversary's service, if he would spare her world.&lt;ref&gt;''Fairest'' 04: ''Wide Awake'', Chapter Four&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The Arabian Homeworld''' – The Arabic Fable Homeworld.&lt;ref name="F42"&gt;''Fables'' 42: ''Arabian Nights (and Days)'', Part One&lt;/ref&gt; It is a primary Islamic world&lt;ref name="F42" /&gt; host to places such as '''[[Ali Baba|Ali Baba's Cave]]''',&lt;ref name="F45"&gt;''Fables 45: ''Arabian Nights (and Days)'', Part Four&lt;/ref&gt; mythical versions of '''[[Baghdad]]'''&lt;ref name="F42" /&gt; and '''[[Samarcand]]''' and '''Fabletown East'''.&lt;ref name="F45" /&gt; [[Flying carpet]]s,&lt;ref name="F45" /&gt;&lt;ref name="F46"&gt;''Fables'' 46: ''The Ballad of Rodney and June'', Part One&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manticores]]&lt;ref name="F46" /&gt; and Ghouls&lt;ref name="C" /&gt; can also be found in this world. A gate to this world is found in modern-day [[Baghdad]], leading to its fabled version.&lt;ref name="F44"&gt;''Arabian Nights (and Days)'', Part Three&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solomon]]'s plan of trapping [[Djinn]]s in wish-granting bottles was initiated here.&lt;ref name="F43"&gt;''Fables'' 43: ''Arabian Nights (and Days)'', Part Two&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sinbad]],&lt;ref name="F42" /&gt; Yusuf,&lt;ref name="F42" /&gt; Hakim&lt;ref name="F42" /&gt; and the Three Harem girls,&lt;ref name="F45" /&gt;&lt;ref name="C" /&gt; Sidi-Nouman,&lt;ref name="F44" /&gt; King [[List of One Thousand and One Nights characters#Shahryār|Shahryar]],&lt;ref name="F1001" /&gt; [[Scheherazade]],&lt;ref name="F1001" /&gt; [[Aladdin]]&lt;ref name="F45" /&gt; and [[Ali Baba]]&lt;ref name="F45" /&gt; all came from this world.
*'''The Cloud Kingdoms''' – From ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'', the Cloud Kingdoms exist in their own interdimensional way, being a world of their own but at the same time existing over all of the other worlds.&lt;ref&gt;''Fables'' 50: ''Happily Ever After''&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Thrumbly Warrens''' – A land inhabited by talking rabbits and inspired by ''[[Watership Down]]'', these were shown as being taken in ''[[1001 Nights of Snowfall]]''.&lt;ref name="F1001"&gt;''Fables: 1001 Nights of Snowfall''&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The Indu''' – A fabled version of [[India]], and home to [[Mowgli]], [[Shere Khan]], [[Bagheera]], [[Baloo]] and others from ''[[The Jungle Book]]''. As the last remaining member of the [[Mughal Raj|Raj]], the current [[Viceroy]] is Lord Mountbatten, a [[Automaton|Clockwork Tiger]] crafted as a gift to Lord Viceroy Lovejoy by the craftsmen of [[Maharaja]] Sindu Baba Singh. The Indu might not be the home to Fables of Indian origin but rather those who are born from the British view on India, thus explaining why it was conquered alongside the European worlds instead of the Oriental worlds.&lt;ref&gt;''Fables: The Dark Ages''&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''Golden Realm''' – Also known as '''The West'''. It was ruled by the King to the West, the father of the prince from the fairy tale ''[[Snow White and Rose Red]]''. The Golden Realm borders on the Silver Realm and The North. The '''Magical Forest''' from ''Snow White and Rose Red'' and ''[[Snow White|Snow White and the Seven Dwarves]]'' lies in between all three realms.&lt;ref name="F96"&gt;''Fables 96: Rose Red'', Chapter Three&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''Silver Realm''' – Also known as '''The East'''. From ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarves''. It was ruled by the [[Queen (Snow White)|Evil Queen]] after her husband, the King to the East, died.&lt;ref name="F96" /&gt;
*'''The North''' – The Lands of [[Prince Charming (Fables)|Prince Charming]], ruled by his father, the King to the North.&lt;ref name="F96" /&gt; Prince Charming's lands were confirmed as taken in the ''Legends in Exile'' story arc.&lt;ref name="F4"&gt;''Fables'' 4: ''Legends in Exile'', Chapter Four&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether or not the Adversary conquered the Dwarf Kingdom underneath&lt;ref name="F1001" /&gt; is unknown. However, no dwarves seem to be living in [[Fabletown]], The Farm or even The [[Golden Boughs Retirement Village]]. Furthermore, Dwarf Kingdom was not even mentioned during war preparations.
*'''Landfall''' – A [[science fiction]]-like world with advanced technology and [[human space flight|space travel]]. Apparently, Landfall was not conquered by the Adversary. [[List of Fables characters#The New Jack Frost – "Jack Two" or "Jack Too"|"Jack Frost Two"]] spent time there during his career as a hero-for hire. The capital city is also called Landfall.&lt;ref&gt;''Jack of Fables'' 41-45: ''The Fulminate Blade''&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[State of Hesse|The Hesse]]''' – The [[Germany|German]] Fable lands.&lt;ref name="F99"/&gt; The name Hesse is derived from one of the larger states in Germany. The Hesse is host to the '''[[Black Forest]]''', the city of '''[[Hamelin]]''', the town of '''[[Winsen (Luhe)|Winsen]]''' and the '''[[Weser]] River'''.&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt; Much of the novel ''Peter and Max'' is set in Hesse,&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt; and Dunster Happ spent seven years in the Hesse trapping the last of the Baleful Hernes&lt;ref name="F86"&gt;''Fables'' 86: ''Boxing Days''&lt;/ref&gt; (presumably a reference to [[Herne the Hunter]] and [[Wild Hunt]]).
*'''[[Erin]]''' – The mythical version of [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt; The name Erin deriving from the Irish name for Ireland “Éirinn".
*'''[[Albion]]''' – The Homelands version of [[England]]&lt;ref name="F99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt; It is the home to many English Fables as the name derives from the eldest known name for the [[United Kingdom]].
*'''[[Thule|Ultima Thule]]''' – Seen in the mini-series ''[[Cinderella: From Fabletown with Love]]''. Thule is a Fable homeworld that mainly draws its characters from [[Norwegian Folktales]]. Humans and [[troll]]s live side by side with [[sentience|sentient]] [[moose]], [[fox]]es and [[polar bear]]s. Thule was governed before, during and after the Adversary conquered it by [[White-Bear-King-Valemon|King Valemon]] and his bride until they were overthrown by its current ruler, Cinderella's Fairy Godmother. Night lasts for six months in Ultima Thule.&lt;ref name="C"&gt;''Cinderella: From Fabletown with Love''&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Land of Oz|Oz]]''' – Also known as the '''Emerald Kingdom''', from the classic ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|Wizard of Oz]]'' series by [[L. Frank Baum]]. It and surrounding kingdoms are controlled by the [[Nome King]].&lt;ref name="F101"&gt;''Fables'' 101: ''The Ascent''&lt;/ref&gt; The Scarecrow, Tin Man, Lion, and Dorothy were imprisoned at the [[Golden Boughs Retirement Village]] until [[Jack Horner (Fables)|Jack Horner]] helped them escape.&lt;ref&gt;''Jack of Fables: The Big Book of War''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Princess Ozma]] escaped and is currently a member of Fabletown's coven of magicians, witches and sorcerers.&lt;ref&gt;''Fables: Witches''&lt;/ref&gt; It is revealed that a road is being constructed through the '''[[Deadly Desert]]''' linking Oz properly to surrounding lands and kingdoms.&lt;ref name="F101" /&gt; The '''[[Emerald City]]''' appears in the story arc ''Inherit the Wind''.&lt;ref name="F111"&gt;''Fables'' 111: ''Inherit the Wind'', Chapter Four&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Land of Ev|The Land of Ev]]''' – [[List of Fables characters#Bufkin|Bufkin]] ends up here after climbing the Fabletown Business Office's tree. Ev, like Oz, was conquered by the former Adversary, and is now ruled by the Nome King as part of his Pan-Ozian Empire. While sitting in one of Ev's native Lunch Box Trees, Bufkin accidentally saves [[List of Fables characters#Bungle, the Glass Cat|Bungle the Glass Cat]], [[List of Fables characters#Jack Pumpkinhead|Jack Pumpkinhead]] and [[List of Fables characters#Other Oz-characters|The Sawhorse]] from a couple of "Rumbe Tumble Toms".&lt;ref name="F101" /&gt;
*The '''Lands of the West''' – Ruled by the [[List of Fables characters#The West Wind|West Wind]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
*'''Far Mattagonia'''&lt;ref name="F115"&gt;''Fables'' 115: ''Cubs in Toyland'', Chapter Two&lt;/ref&gt; – Also known as '''Toyland''',&lt;ref name="F115" /&gt; '''Madland'''&lt;ref name="F115" /&gt; and the '''Wondrous Shore'''.&lt;ref name="F116"&gt;''Fables'' 116: ''Cubs in Toyland'', Chapter Three&lt;/ref&gt; A land of discarded toys, the Discardia.&lt;ref name="F116" /&gt; Because the land is inhabited by toys from the mundane world,&lt;ref&gt;''Fables'' 118: ''Cubs in Toyland'', Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible that Toyland is not actually part of the Homelands, but part of another, alternate reality.
*The '''Hidden Kingdom''' – The homelands version of [[Japan]]. The people of The Hidden Kingdom lived side by side with creatures from [[Japanese mythology]], including the [[funayurei|funa yurei]],&lt;ref name="F9"&gt;''Fairest'' 09: ''The Hidden Kingdom'', Chapter Two&lt;/ref&gt; [[kappa (folklore)|kappa]]s,&lt;ref name="F9" /&gt; the legendary [[Japanese raccoon dog|tanuki]],&lt;ref name="F9" /&gt; [[kitsune]],&lt;ref name="F9" /&gt; [[qilin|kirin]]&lt;ref name="F11"&gt;''Fairest'' 11: ''The Hidden Kingdom'', Chapter Four&lt;/ref&gt; and assorted [[yokai]].&lt;ref name="F9" /&gt; It was ruled by an [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]], who is referred to as [[Emperor of Japan|Heika]],&lt;ref name="F9" /&gt; a term used to identify the emperor in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. The Hidden Kingdom was conquered by the Adversary after the [[shogun|Seii Taishogun]] was secretly laying the way for an invasion.&lt;ref name="F11" /&gt; Many of the kingdom's citizens are living in exile in a secret Fable community in [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name="F9" /&gt;
*The '''[[Roman Empire]]''' – While searching for her lost children, [[List of Fables characters#Rapunzel/Okiku|Rapunzel]] witnessed the birth of an empire, when she found a she-wolf suckling the infant [[Romulus and Remus]].&lt;ref name="Fairest10"&gt;''Fairest'' 10: ''The Hidden Kingdom'', Chapter Three&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''Kingdom of a Thousand Hills''' – A homeworld of [[Africa]]n origin. One of the many worlds that Rapunzel visited while searching for her lost children.&lt;ref name="Fairest10" /&gt;
*'''[[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]]''', '''[[Looking-Glass Land]]''' and '''[[The Hunting of the Snark|Snark Island]]''' – From [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. Never shown or referred to, except for a vague reference to Looking-Glass Land in the "who's who" in the ''[[Jack of Fables]]'' trade paperback ''Jack of Hearts'', which refers to Alice as "a survivor of several adventures through a looking-glass, including a meal of questionable mushrooms". These lands are assumed to have been conquered since numerous playing cards and the [[Cheshire Cat]] are residents of Fabletown.&lt;ref&gt;''Fables 6: Animal Farm'', Chapter One&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of Fables characters#Alice|Alice]],&lt;ref&gt;''Jack of Fables 2: The (Nearly) Great Escape'', Part Two&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Mad Hatter]], the [[Dormouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dormouse]] and the [[March Hare]],&lt;ref&gt;''Jack of Fables 27: Turning Pages'', Part Three&lt;/ref&gt; [[the Walrus and the Carpenter]] (and the oysters they seem not to have eaten yet)&lt;ref&gt;''Jack of Fables 1: The (Nearly) Great Escape'', Part One&lt;/ref&gt; were held prisoner at the [[Golden Boughs Retirement Village]]. [[List of Fables characters#Humpty Dumpty|Humpty Dumpty]] is also a prisoner and a violet/pink caterpillar (which may or may not be the [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Caterpillar]]) is shown eating a leaf while Humpty Dumpty tries to convince [[Jack Horner (Fables)|Jack Horner]] to let him escape with the others.&lt;ref&gt;''Jack of Fables 3: The (Nearly) Great Escape'', Part Three&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vorpal Sword]] is now Fabletown property, and has been referred to as the [[Jabberwock]]'s bane.&lt;ref&gt;''Fables 3: Legends in Exile'', Chapter Three&lt;/ref&gt; This could imply that [[Jabberwocky|Tulgey Wood]] has been conquered as well.

== Places ==
*'''Keep at the End of the World''' – From ''[[East of the Sun and West of the Moon]]'', this was the setting for ''The Last Castle'', where the last Fable refugees escaped from to the Mundy world.&lt;ref name="LC" /&gt;
*'''The [[Black Forest]]''' – Located in the Hesse and former home to [[Bigby Wolf]], [[Frau Totenkinder]] and a whole array of malign spirits, ogres and bogeymen. It is not known whether the Forest itself was taken over by the Empire, because the Hessians themselves do not dare to enter it. The rest of the Hesse, on the contrary, was indeed conquered. In ''[[Peter and Max: A Fables Novel]]'', it is revealed that the Adversary's troops did enter the Black Forests on numerous occasions (to try to hunt The Big Bad Wolf, as well as to travel to Hamelin).&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;
*'''[[Camelot]]''' – Appears in flashbacks in the story arc ''The Good Prince''. According to the [[ghost]] of Sir [[Lancelot]], the legend of Camelot and its fabled [[King Arthur]] set the standard of "true chivalry" for all of [[christendom]] and its legend touched much of the pagan worlds beyond. Lancelot's betrayal would eventually lead to Camelot's downfall.&lt;ref&gt;''Fables'' 62: ''The Good Prince'', Chapter Two&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''Kingdom of Haven''' – The home of [[Flycatcher (Fables)|Flycatcher]], they were shown being taken in ''[[1001 Nights of Snowfall]]''.&lt;ref name="F1001" /&gt;  Recently, he has returned there with his new army of ghosts and has set it up as a place of refuge for anyone wishing to escape the Adversary's control. He has become a consistent thorn in the Adversary's side, having defeated much of the Adversary's forces, including turning all of the Empire's wooden soldiers into a new enchanted grove, taking out the Empire's best fighters.
*'''The Lands of [[List of Fables characters#Beauty and the Beast|Beauty and the Beast]]''' – These are assumed taken because Beast refers to their lands as "forever lost in the Homelands", in the ''Legends in Exile'' story arc.&lt;ref name="F4" /&gt;
*'''The Lands of [[King Cole (Fables)|Old King Cole]]''' – These were shown being taken in ''[[1001 Nights of Snowfall]]''.&lt;ref name="F1001" /&gt;
*'''The Lands of King Noble''' – From the [[Reynard]] stories, these were shown as captured in ''[[1001 Nights of Snowfall]]''.  Reynard helped most of the animals escape the invading forces.&lt;ref name="F1001" /&gt;
*'''[[Nottingham]]''' – Directly mentioned as being captured in ''The Last Castle'', it was [[Robin Hood]]'s home.&lt;ref name="LC" /&gt;

*'''[[Mr. Toad|Toad Hall]]''' – From ''[[Wind in the Willows]]'', it is directly mentioned as being taken in [[1001 Nights of Snowfall]].&lt;ref name="F1001" /&gt; Badger, Toad and Mole all escaped,&lt;ref name="F1001" /&gt; and many assume Stinky the Badger on the Farm is in fact the same character as Mr. Badger.
*'''[[Atlantis]]''' – The underwater kingdom of mermaids was shown being conquered in ''[[1001 Nights of Snowfall]]''.  The only known survivor is Mersey Dotes, now turned into a mermaid.&lt;ref name="F1001" /&gt;
*'''Red City''' – Mentioned by the Snow Queen. Red City Plague originates from this City.&lt;ref&gt;''Fables'' 53: ''Sons of Empire'', Part Two&lt;/ref&gt; Red City Plague might possibly allude to Edgar Allan Poe's ''[[Masque of the Red Death]]''.
*'''[[Night on Bald Mountain|Bald Mountain]]''' – From [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s play. Directly mentioned in ''Jack of Fables''. It is home to Chernobog, one of the Devils Jack made a deal with to prolong his life.&lt;ref&gt;''Jack of Fables'' 16: ''Jack O Lantern''&lt;/ref&gt;

*The '''[[Hundred Acre Wood]]''' – In the ''Jack of Fables'' story ''Jack 'n' Apes'', a character looking remarkably similar to [[Winnie the Pooh]] (but drawn slightly differently, as Winnie the Pooh is currently under copyright) can be seen in flashbacks from the Homelands, barbecuing [[marshmallow]]s with the [[sock monkey]] Saunders in what appears to be the Hundred Acre Wood. They were described as living in "blissful simplicity".&lt;ref name="JOF36" /&gt; In the works of author [[A. A. Milne]], ''Sanders'' is the name of the person who resided at Pooh's home prior to Pooh making it his house,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=|url=http://www.thelinguist.com/fr/en/library/item/65344/|title=''Winnie The Pooh and All, All, All'' Alan Alexander Milne|publisher=The Linguist|date=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008204611/http://www.thelinguist.com/fr/en/library/item/65344/|archivedate=2011-10-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Winnie the Pooh and several other characters from the books were based on the stuffed toys of [[Christopher Robin Milne|Milne's son]]. Saunders and his friends were driven from their homes when the Adversary invaded, and Saunders ended up in [[Africa]] in the mundane world, along with the rest of the [[List of Fables characters#Civilized Apes (maybe)|"civilized apes"]] that Jack Horner claims to have met.&lt;ref name="JOF36" /&gt; Winnie the Pooh and [[Piglet (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Piglet]] apparently made it to the Farm. Both make an obscure appearance in ''Fables'': In part five of the ''Animal Farm'' story arc, when the foiled revolution threatens to flare up again, Pooh and Piglet appears in two panels, from a distance when [[Boy Blue (Fables)|Boy Blue]] tells everyone to move back, and then from behind in the following panel.&lt;ref&gt;''Fables 10: Animal Farm'', Chapter Five&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Prospero's Island'''&lt;ref name="F90"&gt;''Fables'' 90: ''Witches'', Chapter Four&lt;/ref&gt; – The Island which is the setting of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[the Tempest]]''. It is located in the Homelands version of the '''[[Mediterranean Sea]]'''.&lt;ref name="F90" /&gt; [[List of characters in Fables#Prospero|Prospero]]&lt;ref name="F90" /&gt; and [[List of characters in Fables#Maddy|Sycorax]]&lt;ref&gt;''Fables'' 88: ''Witches'', Chapter Two&lt;/ref&gt; are members of Fabletown's 13th Floor of magicians and spellcasters.

The Homelands version of [[China]] is referred to, but not named, in ''Cinderella: Fables are Forever'', which refers to [[Qin Dynasty|the empire]] from the [[Chinese folklore|Chinese folktale]] about [[Lady Meng Jiang|Meng Chiang-Nu]].&lt;ref name="CF" /&gt;

== Americana ==
Another land of interest is Americana, the Fable version of America, appearing mainly in the ''[[Jack of Fables]]'' series.

Large areas in Americana include:
* '''The Colonies''' – The states of [[New England]].&lt;ref name="JOF9"&gt;''Jack of Fables'' 9: ''Jack of Hearts'', Part Four&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Antebellum''' – The South.&lt;ref name="JOF9" /&gt;
* '''Lone Star''' – The state of [[Texas]].&lt;ref name="JOF9" /&gt;
* '''Steamboat''' – The [[Mississippi River]] area.&lt;ref name="JOF9" /&gt;
* '''Gangland''' – The [[Chicago]] area during the 1920s.&lt;ref name="JOF9" /&gt;
* '''The Frontier''' – covering [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], and the [[Dakotas]].&lt;ref name="JOF9" /&gt;
* '''Idyll''' – The [[Appalachian Mountains]] area during the 1950s.&lt;ref name="JOF9" /&gt;
* '''The West''' – covering the [[Rocky Mountains]] area.&lt;ref name="JOF9" /&gt;
* '''The Great White North''' – [[Canada]] and [[The Arctic]].&lt;ref name="JOF19"&gt;''Jack of Fables'' 19: ''Americana'', Part Three&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant places in Americana are '''[[New York City|Big City]]'''&lt;ref name="JOF9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JOF19" /&gt; and '''[[Salem Witch Trials|Salem]]''' located in the Colonies,&lt;ref name="JOF19" /&gt; '''Steamboat City''' located in Steamboat,&lt;ref name="JOF19" /&gt; '''[[Speakeasy]]''' located in Gangland,&lt;ref name="JOF19" /&gt; '''[[the Grand Canyon]]''' created by [[List of Fables characters#Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox|Paul Bunyan]]&lt;ref&gt;''Jack of Fables'' 12: ''The Pad Prince'', Part One&lt;/ref&gt; and unnamed cities in Lone Star,&lt;ref name="JOF19" /&gt; The Frontier&lt;ref name="JOF19" /&gt;  and the Great White North.&lt;ref name="JOF19" /&gt; '''[[Kansas]]''' is referred to in ''Cinderella: Fables Are Forever'' and was the former home of [[List of Fables characters#Dorothy Gale|Dorothy Gale]]&lt;ref name="CF" /&gt;

As could be expected from the Homelands, things are not so normal as they should be. The Idyll area seems to be populated entirely by zombies, all being loyal to the Bookburner (who is the head librarian of Americana, the library being located in Idyll),&lt;ref&gt;''Jack of Fables'' 18: ''Americana'', Part Two&lt;/ref&gt; while the Great White North seems to represent how America views Canada and Alaska, as it is very clean, [[ice hockey]] being the biggest form of amusement and, according to Jack, having horrible bacon.&lt;ref name="JOF19" /&gt;

Untouched by The Adversary's forces, Americana possesses advanced technology compared with the conquered European worlds where the absence of modern arms is crucial to sustain the ruling system. Vehicles and appliances seen are cars from the 1920s, steamtrains, various firearms and even modern household appliances.&lt;ref name="JOF19" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jack of Fables'' 20: ''Americana'', Part Four&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides, the only known way to enter Americana is by dressing as a vagrant and jumping on a train.&lt;ref&gt;''Jack of Fables'' 17: ''Americana'', Part One&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also quite possible that other areas are near or on Americana that resemble ancient Mesoamerica or Latin America.

[[File:Friedensnobelpreisverleihung Internationale Kampagne für das Verbot von Landminen 1997.JPG|thumb|right|The Campaign receiving the 1997 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]]]

The '''International Campaign to Ban Landmines''' ('''ICBL''') is a coalition of [[non-governmental organization]]s whose stated objective is a world free of [[anti-personnel mine]]s and [[cluster munition]]s, where mine and cluster munitions survivors see their rights respected and can lead fulfilling lives. 

The coalition was formed in 1992 when six organisations with similar interests (France-based [[Handicap International]], Germany-based [[Medico International]], UK-based [[Mines Advisory Group]], and US-based [[Physicians for Human Rights]] and [[Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation]]) agreed to cooperate on their common goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icbl.org/en-gb/news-and-events/news/2012/20-years-in-the-life-of-a-nobel-peace-prizewinning.aspx|title=20 years in the life of a Nobel Peace Prizewinning campaign|website=ICBL website|accessdate=10 November 2018|quote=1992: (...) Six NGOs (HI, HRW, MI, MAG, PHR, and VVAF) meet in New York and agree to coordinate campaigning efforts}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign has since grown and spread to become a network with active members in some 100 countries – including  groups working on women, children, veterans, religious groups, the environment, human rights, arms control, peace and development—working locally, nationally and internationally to eradicate antipersonnel landmines.A prominent supporter was [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].

The organization and its founding coordinator, [[Jody Williams]], jointly received the 1997 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for their efforts to bring about the [[Mine Ban Treaty]] (Ottawa Treaty). The signature of this treaty (which bans the use, production, stockpiling, and transfer of anti-personnel mines) is seen as the campaign's greatest success.  The prize was received on the organisation's behalf by its co-founder, [[Rae McGrath]] of the Mines Advisory Group and by Tunn Channareth, a Cambodian mine victim and ICBL activist.

The ICBL monitors the global mine and cluster munition situation (through Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor, its research and monitoring arm), and conducts advocacy activities, lobbying for implementation and universalization of the Mine Ban Treaty, humanitarian mine action programs geared toward the needs of mine-affected communities, support for landmine survivors, their families and their communities, and a stop to the production, use and transfer of landmines, including by non-State armed groups. The ICBL participates in the periodical meetings of the Mine Ban Treaty process, urges states not parties to the treaty to join and non-state armed groups to respect the mine ban norm, condemns mine use and promotes public awareness and debate on the mine issue, organizing events and generating media attention.

==Organizational structure==

In 2011, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) and [[Cluster Munition Coalition]] (CMC) merged into one unified structure, now known as the [[ICBL-CMC]], in order to realize operational efficiencies and reinforce complementary work. The ICBL and the CMC campaigns remain separate and continue to remind governments of their commitments to implement and promote both treaties. Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor continues its unique civil society monitoring program on the humanitarian and developmental consequences of landmines, cluster munitions, and explosive remnants of war. 

The activities of the ICBL-CMC are supported by a Governance Board representative of various elements of the ICBL that provides strategic, financial and human resources oversight. An Advisory Committee provides more regular input to staff and the working of the campaign. Four ambassadors serve as campaign representatives at speaking events and other conferences worldwide. They include [[Jody Williams]], Tun Channareth (Cambodian landmine survivor), Song Kosal (Cambodian landmine survivor), and Margaret Arech Orech (Ugandan landmine survivor and founder of [[Uganda Landmine Survivors Association|Ugandan Landmine Survivors Association]]). Currently, the ICBL has 14 staff members based in Geneva (the central office), Lyon, Paris, and Ottawa. Additionally, the ICBL-CMC hosts several interns each year.

==Mine Ban Treaty==
{{main|Ottawa Treaty}}
The [[Mine Ban Treaty]], or the [[Ottawa Treaty]], is the international agreement that bans [[anti-personnel mine]]s. Officially entitled ''The Convention on the Prohibition, Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Antipersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction'', the treaty is sometimes referred to as the [[Ottawa Treaty|Ottawa Convention]]. The Mine Ban Treaty was adopted in Oslo, Norway, in September 1997 and signed by 122 States in Ottawa, Canada, on 3 December 1997. As of March 2018, there were 164 States Parties to the Ottawa Treaty.

The mine ban treaty suggest several agendas to member states:

# Never use antipersonnel mines, nor to "develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile, retain or transfer" them
# Destroy mines in their stockpiles within four years
# Clear mined areas in their territory within 10 years
# In mine-affected countries, conduct mine risk education and ensure that mine survivors, their families and communities receive comprehensive assistance
# Offer assistance to other States Parties, for example in providing for survivors or contributing to clearance programs
# Adopt national implementation measures (such as national legislation) in order to ensure that the terms of the treaty are upheld in their territory

[http://www.the-monitor.org Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor] is the ICBL-CMC's research and monitoring arm. It is the ''de facto'' monitoring regime for the Mine Ban Treaty and the [[Convention on Cluster Munitions]] of 2008. It monitors and reports on States Parties' implementation of and compliance with the Mine Ban Treaty and the Convention on Cluster Munitions, and more generally, it assesses the problems caused by landmines, cluster munitions, and other explosive remnants of war (ERW). The Monitor represents the first time that NGOs have come together in a coordinated, systematic, and sustained way to monitor humanitarian law or disarmament treaties, and to regularly document progress and problems, thereby successfully putting into practice the concept of civil society-based verification. Since its creation in 1998, Monitor research has been carried out by a global network of primarily in-country researchers, most of them ICBL-CMC campaigners, and all content undergoes rigorous editing by the Monitor's Editorial Team prior to publication.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1638">The '''Laietani''' were an ancient [[Iberians|Iberian]] (Pre-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]]) people of the [[Iberian peninsula]] (the Roman [[Hispania]]).  They inhabited the area occupied by the city of [[Barcelona]].  One of the main thoroughfares of the city, [[Via Laietana]], is named after the Laietani. They are believed to have spoken an [[Iberian language]].

The Laietani minted their own coins, which bore the inscription ''laiesken'' in [[northeastern Iberian script]] that is interpreted in the [[Iberian language]] as a self-reference to the ethnic name of that people: from the Laietani or from those of ''Laie''.

This is a '''list of government-owned companies of Ethiopia'''. A [[Government-owned corporation]] is a legal entity that undertakes [[commerce|commercial]] activities on behalf of an owner [[government]]. There is no standard definition of a government-owned corporation (GOC) or state-owned enterprise (SOE), although the two terms can be used interchangeably. The defining characteristics are that they have a distinct legal shape and they are established to operate in commercial affairs. While they may also have public policy objectives, GOCs should be differentiated from other forms of government agencies or state entities established to pursue purely non-financial objectives.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1861">The '''National Agricultural and Fisheries Policy''' was an act of [[Seychelles|Seychellois]] [[law]] passed in 2002 which was intended to set out the boundaries of [[fishing]] policy in the country between 2002 and 2013.

The policy aims toward “the promotion of sustainable and responsible fisheries development and optimising the benefits from this sector for the present and future generations.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infosa.org.na/dloads/restrict/country%20profile/Syechelles.pdf www.infosa.org.na], Retrieved on June 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy focuses principally on the promotion of [[sustainable fishery|sustainable exploitation]] in fishing practices, and a degree of responsibility for fishing in the [[island]]s whilst providing for [[food]], [[employment]], [[income]], and [[Foreign_tax_credit|foreign revenue]].

==Objectives==
The specific objectives of the fisheries sector are:

*To promote [[Wildlife conservation|conservation]] and management of [[Marine_conservation|marine resource]]s in order to ensure the sustainability and long-term viability of the [[industry]],
*To generate the maximum amount of employment,
*To maximize revenue from fisheries and other related activities,
*To promote an integrated [[economy]],
*To enhance [[food supply]] and [[food security]],
*To promote [[safety at sea]],
*To maintain [[Victoria,_Seychelles|Port Victoria]] as the major [[tuna]] landing–transshipment [[port]] in the western [[Indian Ocean]].

The responsibility of enacting the [[fishery|fisheries]] policies lies with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources in the Seychelles. The Seychelles Fishing Authority (SFA) works in cooperation with the [[government]] to ensure policy is conducted as the law has been implemented.

The strict definition of a ''[[pirate radio]]'' station is a station that operates from sovereign territory without a broadcasting license, or just beyond the [[territorial waters]] of a [[sovereign nation]] from on board a ship or other marine structure with the intention of broadcasting to that nation without obtaining a broadcasting license from that nation (such as [[Radio Caroline]] before its present incarnation).

==Cuba==

===Pirate radio by Cuban exiles===
Unlike the sanctioned and fully licensed transmissions by the United States government, a number of groups in exile, mainly based in [[Florida]], have attempted various offshore radio broadcasts to Cuba, from time to time. These stations are mainly short lived and sporadic in transmission times, but because their broadcasts are not licensed by any nation, their signals are considered to be from ''pirate radio stations'' and the USA has taken various physical and legal steps to close them down at different times.

==Mexico==

===Pirate radio in Mexico===

There are a number of pirate radio stations in Mexico. [[Radio Insurgente]], the voice of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] movement, operated from 2003 to 2009. The station was unlicensed, but according to the [[San Andres Accords]], the indigenous communities targeted by Radio Insurgente had the right to broadcast their own content. The most recent example of a true pirate radio station in Mexico is [[La Tremenda 106.5]] in [[Nuevo Laredo]], [[Tamaulipas]]. It broadcast international contemporary music and news in Spanish and English. It used the fictitious U.S. call sign "KLPR" on its logo. The station began operations in May 2006, was shut down in June 2008 by the [[Law enforcement in Mexico|federal police]] in a "violent" take over. It was suspected that the signal was also used for transmitting messages of members of organized crime. Today, there are several other pirate stations in Nuevo Laredo as well.

The [[border-blaster]] or other border stations in Mexico do not meet either above definitions of ''pirate radio station'', however may be considered as such by some governments.

===Border blasters===
{{Main|Border blaster}}
From the earliest days of the history of broadcasting, a number of radio stations [[licensed]] in Mexico, became known to the general public as [[border-blasters]]. This was due to their excessive use of power which was necessary to reach their intended audience in American cities far north of the border. The traditional border-blasters were [[AM broadcasting|AM radio]] stations; though there are numerous [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] and even [[television]] stations along the border that broadcast to the U.S. from Mexico, the power of FM stations along the border is limited by a U.S.-Mexican agreement.

However, because these stations are licensed by the government of Mexico, they can only be classified as ''pirate radio stations'' in the same way that the [[United Kingdom|British]] government classified [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] as a ''pirate radio station''. Radio Luxembourg was a licensed station broadcasting with a power and on a frequency that the British authorities objected to, because the intended audience for its programs were located within the United Kingdom. The objection by the government of the United Kingdom to commercial broadcasts from Luxembourg, France and other countries, was primarily based upon its protection of the non-commercial [[BBC Radio]] monopoly. Also, the UK at the time required a license for radios, which was limited to UK stations; it still requires a license for [[television]] sets. However, the U.S. has never required a license to listen to broadcast radio or TV; today, it even issues routine licenses under the [[Brinkley Act]], originally enacted to silence the border-blaster [[charlatan]] [[John R. Brinkley]], for the operation of Mexican stations from studio facilities in the U.S.

==United States of America==

===Land-based unlicensed broadcasts===
In the United States, the term ''pirate radio'' implies the unlicensed broadcasting use of any part of the [[radio spectrum]] that is reserved for use by governmental, public or commercial licensees by the [[Federal Communications Commission]]. This includes the [[Frequency modulation|FM]], [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] and [[shortwave radio]] bands.

Compared to [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] systems of government which restrict access to the means of communication, the airwaves of the USA are relatively free from direct government [[censorship]].{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} As a result of this difference, the term ''pirate radio'' has a different interpretation than in countries where access to communication is limited.

In the United States, pirate radio is frequently, but not always, associated with [[anarchism]], which considers governmental spectrum regulatory schemes as favoring the interests of large [[corporation]]s, due to reasons such as high licensing costs. Therefore, some anarchists consider pirate radio transmissions to be a challenge to that authority.

Pirate radio is also in large part the resulting backlash from [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s [[Title 47 CFR Part 15]], which prohibits certain power broadcasting. [[NPR]] and the [[National Association of Broadcasters|NAB]] convinced the FCC to eliminate the [[list of broadcast station classes|class D]] license in 1979. This kept all new low-power stations from getting a license, and bumped all of the old ones down to secondary status, forcing many more off the air since then. Despite this, an explosion of [[broadcast translator]]s on FM, technically identical but rebroadcasting other stations, most part of religious broadcasting networks, has occurred since then. This further fueled pirate operators in the 1980s and 1990s.

In 1982, an organization of pirate radio monitoring enthusiasts was formed by [[Darren Leno]]. Known as the [[Association of Clandestine Radio Enthusiasts]] (ACE) the organization was and remains a very popular conduit for sharing information about North American pirate radio and other unusual radio transmissions.

Another such group, calling itself "The RPMRADIO Network" launched a series of projects aimed directly at the corporate radio media in central Texas. Responding to FCC raids of several pirate FM stations in the San Antonio-Austin area, RPMRADIO started by gathering grass roots support, then turned on 10 pirate fm radio stations across the entire area, with the promise to replace each station raided with 10 more stations. Fueled by remarks made by Alex Jones on his radio talk show, this "Ten for One" campaign is reported to have caused the FCC to rethink its approach to the fight that was developing between Pro-Corporate radio and Anti-Corporate radio forces.
 
Because of this severe lack of access, numerous pirate radio operators (such as [[Stephen Dunifer]]), as well as other groups petitioned the FCC for a new [[LPFM]] service.  After many years of trying, this finally was passed around 2000, although it blocked former pirate operators from holding licenses. Lobbied by the commercial radio industry, the [[U.S. Congress]] intervened and limited the new service even further, though technical tests later proved this to be baseless, and the added restrictions were lifted.

Although this should mean that pirate radio has seen a decrease, most of the licensees are [[Church body|churches]], [[college]]s, and state or local government [[transportation]] departments, as the FCC requires the licensee to be a [[non-profit]] [[organization]]. Pirate radio also continues because legal open spots on the FM dial have been filled in since and because of the 1979 ruling, by both full-power and translator stations.

[[Part 15]] of the FCC rules allows the use of spectrum without a license but emissions pursuant to this rule are not practical for broadcasting due to extremely restrictive power levels which limit range (range varies depending on frequency spectrum). Part 15 is intended to allow for operation of a broad range of electrical devices that emit radio energy either as an intended element of their operation (e.g. garage door openers, FM modulators for iPod auto use) or as a by-product of their operation. Despite the limited range possible under Part 15, some small broadcast stations are operated within its parameters, while others operate claiming to be Part 15 compliant but with signals exceeding what is permitted under the rule.

Because basic radio transmission equipment is relatively easy to obtain in the USA and because it is relatively easy to hide, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), which has the [[authority]] to regulate radio communications, sometimes has difficulty in finding and prosecuting offenders who transmit without a license. [[Triangulation]] may be used, but most frequently a [[spectrum analyzer]] is driven around the affected area, with a person monitoring where the suspect signal is highest, and another one looking for any obvious signs such as an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] or small tower (like that used for [[amateur radio]]).

===Hearing pirate radio stations in North America===
Finding, identifying and even corresponding with pirate radio stations is, for many radio enthusiasts, itself a hobby. Most radio listeners in North America, however, will never hear a pirate station unless they seek one out.

Pirate radio stations on FM are often found towards the bottom of the FM broadcasting band, particularly between 87.9&amp;nbsp;MHz and 91.9&amp;nbsp;MHz, which is allocated to non-commercial educational, public and religious broadcasters. On mediumwave (AM), pirate radio stations are often found between 1610&amp;nbsp;kHz and 1710&amp;nbsp;kHz with the later frequency 1710 being far the most popular. On shortwave (SW), the most common frequencies to check for pirates in North America is the 6800 to 7000&amp;nbsp;kHz (42.86 metres-44.11 metres) range, with 6855&amp;nbsp;kHz (43.76 m), 6875&amp;nbsp;kHz (43.64 m), 6925&amp;nbsp;kHz (43.32 m), 6950&amp;nbsp;kHz (43.16 m) and 6955&amp;nbsp;kHz (43.13 m) being most commonly used, and 6925&amp;nbsp;kHz being by far the most commonly used frequency.  Some stations will use "offset" or "split" frequencies, such as 6876&amp;nbsp;kHz, 6923&amp;nbsp;kHz, 6962&amp;nbsp;kHz and 6969&amp;nbsp;kHz, either to avoid interference from other stations or as part of the "image" of their particular station. Pirates can pop up anytime, but evenings, weekends and holidays are the best time to listen. Pirates operating on shortwave from North America often use [[single sideband]] modulation as an alternative to AM.

There are a wide variety of stations. Some just play music; others, like The Crystal Ship and Radio Free Speech are political ; KIPM produces its own science-fiction programming with radio plays reminiscent of old-time radio; WHYP is the James Brownyard memorial station, playing clips from an old PA daytime AM station of that same name. Radio One recreated the sound of 1960s top-40 radio and played oldies with an echo chamber reverb effect behind the announcer much like WABC had done. The Voice of the Sea Cucumber was known for some very strange programming, its announcer calling himself "Dear Leader." There are also many stations that are specifically aimed to the pirate radio listening community; many are long-running gag stations such as WBNY, the Voice of the Rodent Revolution, with programming by its leader Commander Bunny, who frequently sends coded messages to operatives in the field, as well as instructions to Al Fansome to check his tire pressure. A few stations mysteriously appear once a year, such as WJFK, which is usually on the air around November 22. There are also stations that provide eclectic music programming, such as Wolverine Radio, WMPR, Liquid Radio (Simulcast of its FM broadcast), and The Crystal Ship plays classic hits outside of political programming.

Shortwave or HF pirate stations often coordinate their broadcasts to avoid interfering with each other.  Pirate radio loggings are often reported on Internet forums, allowing potential listeners to know when a station is on the air.  

Geographically, FM and [[mediumwave]] pirates tend to cluster in urban areas such as New York City, San Francisco, Toronto, and throughout [[Florida]]. However, pirate stations are active throughout all regions of North America. Shortwave pirates are widely dispersed throughout North America and can be heard hundreds and even thousands of miles from their location. Most shortwave pirates operate on the East Coast of the USA.

Differing somewhat from the pirate radio stereotype of "kids playing radio," there has been a growing trend towards [[ethnocentric]] pirate radio in North America. Usually these stations broadcast in native languages such as Spanish or [[creole language|Haitian Creole]], but sometimes English, as in the case of a widely heard mediumwave pirate with a [[Jewish Orthodox]] format.

[[Pirate radio in Europe]] can often be heard in North America with a good [[shortwave radio]] and [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]. This is considered [[DXing]]. The 6200 to 6300&amp;nbsp;kHz (47.62-48.38 m) range is most commonly used.

After the FM translator for WJIB on 101.3&amp;nbsp;MHz hit the airwaves on August 4, 2017, both stations broadcast on the frequency until about August 16, 2017 when Big City shut off. The station reportedly is broadcasting at lower power on 100.3&amp;nbsp;MHz which may soon become the frequency for an FM translator; Big City also streamcasts.
* Booger Brothers Broadcasting System, [[Queens]], New York (circa mid-1930s to 1941). Operated by musician [[Les Paul]] from an apartment house where he lived. The station, which reportedly used an amplified [[carrier-current]] system, employing the building's electrical wiring as an antenna, broadcast at night with jam sessions by jazz musicians Paul knew and played with. Paul claimed that he was visited by Federal agents, but it was only to inform him that his broadcasts were interfering with flight control radio at nearby [[LaGuardia Airport]]. He later installed a bandwidth filter to stop the interference. Paul shut down the station after he nearly electrocuted himself by accidentally touching the transmitter's power cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last=xfpine |coauthors= |title=Les Paul's Pirate Radio Station in Queens |work=glasscapsule |page= |date=March 7, 2012 |accessdate=12 October 2016|quote= |url=http://www.glasscapsule.com/2012/03/les-pauls-pirate-radio-station-in-queens/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [http://www.myspace.com/powerhits1033 Power Hits 103.3 FM] (on-air April to November 2006) Available in the [[Quad Cities]] metropolitan area, this station had been a controversy due to the interpretation of Code of Federal Regulations Title 47 Section 73.3542 saying you can broadcast without a license during time of emergency. The regulation states that a war is considered a "time of emergency." The station's online stream was on its [[MySpace]] page. Most of the music played on the station fell under a [[Contemporary hit radio|CHR]] or [[Top 40 (radio format)|Top 40]] format with some occasional 1980s and [[1990s in music|1990s]] hits. The station also occasionally aired commercials for a local [[Honda]] dealership and a nightclub. A rental dispute caused a change in operation (from the station founders to their landlords, as the landlords seized Power Hits' equipment and rental space for their own to pay off back rent), which eventually led to the station going off the air.

* [[RPMRADIO Central Studio]]" in San Antonio, Texas operated on 97.7FM, broadcasting uncensored rock and roll for over five years. Using publicity stunts and public demonstrations at large music concerts to gain supporters, The RPMRADIO Network brought the first pirate radio broadcasts to an area that was considered "the Garden of Eden" of radio markets, and caused a minor revolution in the programing practices of radio broadcasters in that area. When they finally received their first notice to quit from the FCC, the station operators went underground, and continue to operate several "Low Power Pirate FM Stations" throughout the area. During this time, the local corporate media outlets, including all the TV stations, newspapers, and radio stations, maintained a total news blackout as to the existence of this group of pirate radio stations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1178">:''"[[Polabian Slavs]]" is often used as a general term for the West Slavs of Germany. This article is about the specific tribe called "Polabians".''
The '''Polabians''' ({{lang-de|Polaben}}; {{lang-la|Polabi}}) were a constituent [[Lechites|Lechitic]] [[tribe]] of  the [[Obotrites]] who lived between the [[Trave]] and the [[Elbe]]. The main settlement of the Polabians was Racisburg (modern [[Ratzeburg]]), named after their Prince Ratibor. The Polabians were similar to the Drevani, also known as the Draväno-polaben or Drevanen, in [[Lüchow-Dannenberg]].

In 1139 [[Henry the Lion]] granted "Polabia" to Count [[Henry of Badewide]]. The tribe was subsequently [[Germanisation|Germanized]] and assimilated over the following centuries. The last remnants of the Polabians died out in the 17th century, as did the [[Polabian language]]. Cultural remnants of the Polabians of [[Lower Saxony]] include numerous villages in the region based on Slavic settlement forms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3559">The '''Prague Biennale''' is an international art exhibition in [[Prague]], Czech Republic, held in alternate (odd-numbered) years. It was founded in 2003 by [[Helena Kontova]] and [[Giancarlo Politi]].&lt;ref name=bf /&gt; It is supported by the Czech [[Ministry of Culture (Czech Republic)|Minister of Culture]] and the City of [[Prague]]. The ''[[New York Times]]'' said of it in 2009: "Now in its fourth iteration, the biennial has a reputation for working on the cheap (the lighting is minimal to nonexistent, meaning viewings have to end by sundown) and for offering the first appearance of emerging artists from Central and Eastern Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/travel/19cultured.html?pagewanted=3|title=In Prague, Art is Everywhere but Not Always Easy...|date=19 July 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=20 January 2013 | first=Evan | last=Rail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1900">The '''Púchov culture''' was an [[archaeological culture]] named after site of [[Púchov]]-Skalka in [[Slovakia]]. Its probable bearer was the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Cotini]] and/or [[Anartes]] tribes. It existed in northern and central Slovakia (although it also plausibly spread to the surrounding regions) between the 2nd century BCE and the 1st century CE. The Púchov culture developed from the [[Lusatian culture]] and it was influenced later by the [[Illyrians|Illyrian culture]], the [[Celts]], and by the beginning of the [[Anno Domini|Christian era]], the [[Dacians]]. Settlements were situated on moderate hill sides and near streams. The largest known religious, economic, and political center of the Púchov culture was the [[hill-fort]] of [[Havránok]], famous for its traces of human sacrifice. As a result of the Dacian and Germanic tribal expansions at the beginning of the [[Common Era]], the Púchov culture and its settlements began to decline, and its bearers were eventually assimilated into Dacian and other migrating tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Bolchazy, Caplovic (2006) 308&lt;/ref&gt;

It stands on high ground at the shoreward end of Delimara Point, above il-Ħofra-z-Zgħira. It is a [[polygonal fort]] and was built by the [[British Empire|British]] from 1881 to 1886. It commands a field of fire northwards over St Thomas' Bay and [[Marsaskala]].

==History==
St Paul's Battery was built between 1881 and 1886 by the British to help [[Fort Tas-Silġ]] cover the defence of St Thomas Bay. The battery has a D-shape, with three gun emplacements for [[RML 7 inch gun]], which were mounted on six-foot platforms. Its gun crew and garrison were stationed at Fort Tas-Silġ.

The battery's guns were removed and it was abandoned 1900 since it had lost its importance as a defensive position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delimara Gas and Power Combined Cycle Gas Turbine and Liquefied Natural Gas receiving, storage and re-gasification facilities - Environmental Impact Assessment - Appendix Two Volume One|url=http://www.mepa.org.mt/EIACMS/documents/Delimara/B02i_CCGT-LNG_DPS_EIS_App02i_ESRs_A4_Simplex.pdf|website=MEPA|publisher=ERSLI Consultants Ltd ''on behalf of'' Enemalta Corporation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329025345/http://www.mepa.org.mt/EIACMS/documents/Delimara/B02i_CCGT-LNG_DPS_EIS_App02i_ESRs_A4_Simplex.pdf|archivedate=29 March 2015|page=33|date=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The battery remains abandoned to this day and in very poor condition. It is covered with trees and shrubs and its ditch is filled with debris, but the gun emplacements, ditch and entrance to its underground magazine are still visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St Paul's Battery|url=http://wikimapia.org/28096303/St-Paul-s-Battery|website=Wikimapia|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the battery was shortlisted as a possible site for the campus of the proposed [[American University of Malta]]. It was not chosen, and the campus is to be split up between Dock No. 1 in [[Cospicua]] and Żonqor Point in [[Marsaskala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='American' University to occupy Dock 1 buildings and reduced Zonqor site|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150820/local/update-3-american-university-to-occupy-dock-1-buildings-and-reduced.581335|accessdate=20 August 2015|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yangtse craton location.jpg|thumb|250px|South China Craton's current location within Asia]]
'''South China''', also known as '''South China Craton''', '''South Chinese Craton''', or '''Yangtze Craton''', was an ancient [[continent]] ([[craton]]) that contained today's [[Northern and southern China|South]] and [[Southeast China]], [[Indochina]], and parts of [[Southeast Asia]] (i.e. [[Borneo]] and adjacent islands). South China had been part of past supercontinents, including [[Rodinia]], [[Pannotia]], [[Gondwana]], [[Pangaea]] and [[Laurasia]].

==Precambrian history==
About one billion years ago, during the late [[Proterozoic]], the Rodinia supercontinent formed. South China was part of Rodinia. South China was bordered by the [[Mirovia]] Ocean to the north, [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] to the east, [[Australia]] to the west, and [[Laurentia]] to the south. 750 million years ago, Rodinia rifted and South China became an isolated continent.

A hundred million years later, these fragmented pieces of continent assembled back together to create the supercontinent of [[Pannotia]]. South China collided with North China and Eastern [[Gondwana]] (mainly [[Australia]]).

==Paleozoic history==
When Pannotia disintegrated 550 million years ago, South China (and [[North China (continent)|North China]]) became part of and remained with Eastern Gondwana for millions of years. Late in the [[Silurian]] (175 million years later after Pannotia's disintegration), South China (and North China), [[rift]]ed away from Gondwana and moved across the ancient, shrinking [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]]. A new ocean was forming {{clarify span|text=in its southern end|explain=unclear text|date=March 2018}}, [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]]. By the [[Late Carboniferous]] (300 million years ago), while North China collided with Siberia and [[Kazakhstania]], completely closing the Proto-Tethys Ocean, South China became an independent continent. For much of the [[Permian]] Period, South China remained in the tropical latitudes. And also, while most of the giant [[lycopods]] of the Carboniferous disappeared, giant lycopods remained in South China, since its isolation from the now formed Pangaea. [[Cimmeria (continent)|Cimmeria]], a microcontinent that consisted of today's [[Tibet]], [[Iran]], [[Turkey]], and parts of [[Southeast Asia]] rifted away from Gondwana (just as North and South China did earlier), and was heading towards Laurasia. Paleo-Tethys Ocean started to shrink, while the new [[Tethys Ocean]] expanded. In the [[Middle Triassic]], the eastern portion of Cimmeria collided with South China, and together drew northwards, towards [[Laurasia]].

==Mesozoic and Cenozoic history==
In the [[Late Triassic]] Epoch, South China collided with North China, forming the China we know today. North China and South China had been together since their collision in the Jurassic. Much of South China became a [[mountain range]] because of [[India]]'s collision with Cimmeria's southern coastline.

'''The International League of Dermatological Societies''' (ILDS) is a [[non-governmental organization]] that works closely with the [[World Health Organization]]. It was founded in 1935, but because of [[World War II]] no congresses were held until 1952. It is governed by the International Committee of Dermatology.

The ILDS is the parent organization of the International Foundation for Dermatology,&lt;ref name="pmid12734510"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marks R |title=The International League of Dermatological Societies: from the World Congress of Dermatology to the International Foundation for Dermatology and beyond |journal=J.

After the publication of [[ICD|ICD-10]], the ILDS produced a series of compatible extensions for use in [[dermatology]].

'''Vickers Wellington LN514''' was a [[Vickers Wellington]] bomber built in 1943 in record time, as part of a British [[propaganda]] effort during the [[Second World War]].

The bomber was constructed in 23 hours and 50 minutes, and took off 24 hours and 48 minutes after the first parts of the airframe had been laid down, beating the previous record of 48 hours set by an American factory. It was constructed at the [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] factory in [[Broughton, Flintshire]]. The record attempt was the idea of the government to bolster morale at home and send a message abroad that British wartime manufacturing capacity was unaffected by [[Nazi Germany|German]] bombing.

The [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] produced the [[newsreel]] ''Worker's Week-End'' using film of the attempt, detailing the construction process from the beginning to first flight, emphasising the vital role of [[women in the workforce]] on the "factory [[Front (military)|front]]". It was distributed both at home and in America, deliberately using a North American sounding narrator.

As part of the [[BBC]] television's [[Battle of Britain]] 70th anniversary season, the record attempt was the subject of a one-hour documentary film ''Wellington Bomber''. Bringing together some of the workers who were originally involved, it examined the effort through their eyes, and together with historian [[Max Hastings]] and Rupert "Tiny" Cooling, a former Wellington pilot, examined the bomber and the wider historical context. It was first broadcast on [[BBC Four]] on 14 September 2010.

==Background==

===Wellington bomber===
{{Main|Vickers Wellington}}&lt;!--this section may be too large and detailed for this particular article--&gt;
The {{convert|26.25|m|ft}} wingspan Vickers Wellington bomber was designed by [[Rex Pierson]] and made by the [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] company.&lt;ref name="BBCNewsMagazine13Sep2010" /&gt; It was named after [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]]. A total of 11,461 were built during the war, more than any other British aircraft except the [[Supermarine Spitfire]] and [[Hawker Hurricane]], which were smaller, single-engine aircraft.&lt;ref name="ThisIsKent11Jul2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCFourProgrammesWellingtonBomber" /&gt;

With its [[geodesic airframe|geodetic]] [[aluminium]] skeleton [[airframe]] construction covered by a varnished linen fabric skin it was said to be held in great regard by aircrews and pilots for its durability and resistance to damage, able to survive long enough to return home, even if one engine failed.&lt;ref name=BBCNewsMagazine13Sep2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=ThisIsKent11Jul2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCFourProgrammesWellingtonBomber/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCPressOffice1Sep2010WellingtonBomber/&gt;

The aircraft's fabric construction and a frame which simply slotted together, likened to the children's toy [[Meccano]], meant that it was easy to assemble, making it a perfect choice for the construction record attempt.&lt;ref name=BBCNewsMagazine13Sep2010/&gt;

The Wellington was a mainstay of the British air fleet during World War II, used throughout the conflict, first for [[Royal Air Force|RAF Bomber Command]] as a strike bomber during the 1940 Battle of Britain and beyond, and after being superseded by the larger [[Handley Page Halifax|Halifax]] and [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]], for RAF Coastal Command in the anti-shipping role from 1943.&lt;ref name=BBCNewsMagazine13Sep2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCFourProgrammesWellingtonBomber/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCPressOffice1Sep2010WellingtonBomber/&gt; Two Wellington bombers have survived to the present; the one recovered from [[Loch Ness]] is on display at [[Brooklands Museum]] Weybridge, Surrey.&lt;ref name=BBCNewsMagazine13Sep2010/&gt;

===Propaganda===
[[File:New Zealand Wellington Bombers in England1939.JPG|thumb|right|Wellington bombers at [[RAF Stradishall]] in 1939, ready to fly to Brussels and Paris as a show of strength from the RAF]]
With the Broughton factory being run by the [[Ministry of Aircraft Production]], 6,000 people, over half of them women used in place of the men sent to fight, worked 12-hour shifts to make 28 Wellington bombers a week at peak production.&lt;ref name=BBCNewsMagazine13Sep2010/&gt; Propaganda films were a significant part of the British war effort, often examining the 'factory front' which was crucial to the real front, paying tribute to the dedication and skill of the workers, encouraging new workers to volunteer, and keeping up morale of those already working and of the wider population.&lt;ref name=MovingHistoryWorkersWeekEnd/&gt;

The Wellington bomber film came in 1943, at the height of the British bombing efforts against Germany. With speed and morale in aircraft production now an important part of sustaining that effort, the Ministry of War together with the RAF came up with the idea of a construction record attempt, and filming it for a  Ministry of Information propaganda newsreel.&lt;ref name=BBCNewsMagazine13Sep2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=ThisIsKent11Jul2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCFourProgrammesWellingtonBomber/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCPressOffice1Sep2010WellingtonBomber/&gt; It was to be both a tribute to the workers of the British aircraft industry, and a way for the Ministry of War to demonstrate to the world the spirit and efficiency still evident in wartime aircraft production, despite heavy German bombardment.&lt;ref name=BBCNewsMagazine13Sep2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCNewsMagazine13Sep2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=NationalArchivesWorkersWeek/&gt;

In particular, the movie was to be shown in America, with an American-sounding narrator deliberately chosen, to show that Britain had not been beaten by [[The Blitz]], the sustained German bombing of 1940-1941, and was now holding its own in production efforts. In a show of competitiveness, breaking the record held by the Americans was also seen as '[[:wikt:one in the eye for|one in the eye for]]' the Americans' comparatively late entry into the fight.&lt;ref name=BBCNewsMagazine13Sep2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph13Sep2010/&gt;

Other propaganda films of the period focussing on factory production include the one-off newsreels ''Night Shift'' (1942), ''[[River Clyde|Clyde]]-built'' (1943), ''Coalminer'' (1943), and ''A Date with a Tank'' (1944), and the series ''Worker and Warfront'' (1942–1946) and ''War Work News'' (1942–1945). These are now preserved in the [[Imperial War Museum]].&lt;ref name=MovingHistoryWorkersWeekEnd/&gt;

==Record attempt==
The aim was to build an operational Wellington bomber from scratch against the clock, "from first bolt to take-off"&lt;ref name=BBCNewsMagazine13Sep2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=ThisIsKent11Jul2010/&gt; The record was at the time held by the Americans, having achieved the feat in 48 hours in a bomber factory in [[California]].&lt;ref name=BBCNewsMagazine13Sep2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCPressOffice1Sep2010WellingtonBomber/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph13Sep2010/&gt;

The newsreel records that the bomber's wheels lifted from the ground 24 hours and 48 minutes after construction began.&lt;ref name=BBCNewsMagazine13Sep2010/&gt; The 2010 documentary also states the build time after the first part of the airframe had been laid was "ten minutes less than 24 hours", and the take-off took place 24 hours and 48 minutes later.&lt;ref name=BBCFourProgrammesWellingtonBomber/&gt; Some sources state the assembly time was 23 hours and 48 minutes.&lt;ref name=BBCPressOffice1Sep2010WellingtonBomber/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph13Sep2010/&gt;

The target time set by the workers was to assemble it in 30 hours or less, with a test pilot scheduled for an afternoon flight. However, assembly moved so fast that the pilot had to be roused from his bed to make the flight.&lt;ref name=BBCNewsMagazine13Sep2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCFourProgrammesWellingtonBomber/&gt;&lt;ref name=NationalArchivesWorkersWeek/&gt;&lt;ref name=IWMRecordUKY504/&gt;

The bomber was constructed over a weekend, starting on a Saturday morning.&lt;ref name=BBCNewsMagazine13Sep2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCPressOffice1Sep2010WellingtonBomber/&gt; The workers donated their free time for the attempt, donating their bonus money to the [[Red Cross]] Aid to Russia Fund.&lt;ref name=BBCNewsMagazine13Sep2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=NationalArchivesWorkersWeek/&gt;&lt;ref name=IWMRecordUKY504/&gt;

The date of the construction is not known; it was probably early summer 1943 (based on National Archives records)&lt;ref name=BBCNewsMagazine13Sep2010/&gt; or early autumn (the 2010 documentary asserts it was one autumn weekend).&lt;ref name=BBCFourProgrammesWellingtonBomber/&gt; October 1943 was the newsreel's release date according to the National Archives,&lt;ref name=NationalArchivesWorkersWeek/&gt; or the production date according to Imperial War Museum records.&lt;ref name=IWMRecordUKY504/&gt; The newsreel's narrator states that the record attempt took place "not so long ago".

The bomber airframe used for the record attempt was [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|serial number]] LN514.&lt;ref name=BBCNewsMagazine13Sep2010/&gt; According to the Imperial War Museum record, the newsreel "stresses throughout that standards were not lowered for faster speed".&lt;ref name=IWMRecordUKY504/&gt;

'''''Worker's Week-End'''''{{Ref|1|note 1}} was the propaganda newsreel that resulted from the construction effort.

===Production===
The reel was produced by the [[Crown Film Unit]] and financed by the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]].&lt;ref name=IWMRecordUKY504/&gt; Filmed at the Vickers-Armstrongs factory in [[Broughton, Flintshire]], it was directed by Ray Elton and produced by John Monck.&lt;ref name=IWMRecordUKY504/&gt; The reel was filmed in black and white on 2 reels of [[35 mm film]] (P 1/35/N).&lt;ref name=MovingHistoryWorkersWeekEnd/&gt;&lt;ref name=IWMRecordUKY504/&gt; It was later also transferred to [[VHS]].&lt;ref name=MovingHistoryWorkersWeekEnd/&gt; The narrator was [[Flying Officer]] J. Peach of the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]].&lt;ref name=NationalArchivesWorkersWeek/&gt;{{Ref|1|note 3}}

===Format===
The newsreel's picture closely followed the Wellington bomber and its construction, interspersed with small periods of the wider scene. The audio consisted of the narration, factory background sounds, and the plane's sound on takeoff. The narration focuses on the people involved until the main parts come together, after which it describes more of the production process.

As well as the construction process, early on in the reel just after the flap testing is shown, chief cameraman Chick Fowl and his camera are briefly shown as they film the workers. In addition to simply describing the process and the workers, the narrator relates a couple of anecdotes during the reel - as the electrical work begins, and during the shot of the cockpit exterior and interior work. He indicates that the company test pilot Gerald Whinney, who "stood next to me" (but not shown), said that the electrical fitters were "like a lot of bloody ants, hope they don't forget anything". He also describes how he had noticed the girl working on the exterior of the cockpit, Ivy Bennett, because she was wearing a  pink chiffon blouse, because she had come back from a party to help out in the attempt.

===Assembly depiction===
[[File:Vickers Wellington.png|thumb|right|Wellington bomber Mk1 to Mk14 outline schematics]]
The newsreel begins by showing a tractor opening the factory door, and with the workers arriving. The construction is seen beginning with the first fuselage pieces being assembled on [[jig (tool)|jigs]], as well as the work being inspected. The film moves on to show wing assembly and inspection, and the making of the cabin heater. Returning to the fuselage, it shows the fitting of the wooden floor and a [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] frame, moving on to the fitting of the [[cockpit]] floor, seat and [[Yoke (aircraft)|control column]], installed as one part. Moving away from the fuselage, the [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] are shown being tested and the [[aileron]]s being assembled. Returning to the fuselage, workers begin fitting the electrical wiring and systems. After more detailed scenes of its assembly, the completed fuselage is shown being removed from the jig.

The film then shows the bolting and stitching of the covering fabric to the wings and other large control surface frames, described as the "4 great sections" of the aircraft. After showing the assembly of the tail end of the fuselage frame, the covering of this and the main fuselage is also shown. While the covering is being completed, the weatherproofing of the finished parts with [[Aircraft dope|resin]] (''dope''), is seen beginning. An overhead crane brings an engine to be fitted to the rest of the power [[nacelle]], referred to as the 'egg', followed by more scenes of engine assembly. The film then shows all the major parts being moved to a main assembly area, including moving the whole fuselage. A crane moves the '[[power egg]]s' into position, and then the tail and [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevators]] are fitted to the fuselage.

The [[bomb bay]] beam and the fuel tanks are installed, then a crane fits the wings to the fuselage, and [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]s to the engines. After a general scene of the construction, the crane lifts the rear [[gun turret]] into place, followed by a shot of the main [[Landing gear|undercarriage]] and wheel being moved into the raised position. After a general scene of the cockpit being worked on simultaneously inside and out, the fitting of the inner fuel tank is shown, followed by another wide shot of the general scene at the front of the bomber. A close-up of the [[Royal Air Force roundels|Royal Air Force roundel]] being hand-painted onto the fuselage is followed by a scene of the [[tailwheel]] being inspected.

The bomber is towed to the running shed at the end of the factory, the location for final inspection and engine testing. All the assembled workers are shown watching as the engines are started for the first time, for which the factory door is opened. After a shot of the front gun turret being tested for movement, the completed bomber is towed out of the factory tail-first, as a worker cleans the cockpit windows. With the assembled workers watching, the test pilot enters the aircraft, [[taxiing|taxies]] into position, and lifts off for its first [[test flight]].

===Timing depiction===
During the film the narrator relates how the attempt is doing for time. At the beginning he says the aim was for completion in under 30 hours, and that work started at 9 a.m.. At 1:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. the fuselage leaves the jig with electrics fitted. At 6:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. the main parts are coming together. With the change in shifts also noted, the propeller fitting occurs at 8:23&amp;nbsp;p.m. It's noted the workers are now making bets as to whether they will beat the 30-hour target. The landing gear is on the aircraft by 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. By 3:20&amp;nbsp;a.m. the next morning the aircraft is being towed to the running shed. The engines are started for the first time at 6:15&amp;nbsp;a.m., or 21:15 hrs since construction began. He then relates how the attempt is delayed at this stage for 2 hours of "snagging" (last-minute rectifications). At 8:50&amp;nbsp;a.m. (the 23:50 hr mark), the completed bomber is wheeled out of the factory door. As the Wellington takes off, he states "its wheels lifted from the ground, in exactly 24 hours and 48 minutes." The newsreel ends with a note, '[[Postscript|P.S.]] At 7:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. this bomber was flown by a [[Ferry flying|ferry pilot]] to its operational base.'

The workers named in the film are predominantly women doing a variety of jobs including assembly and testing. As workers are named by the narrator, he also relates many of their previous occupations.

===Analysis===
According to the Imperial War Museum, the newsreel "provides quite good coverage of various processes in construction" describing it as a "good film well put together: right atmosphere of dedication, efficiency, speed".&lt;ref name=IWMRecordUKY504/&gt;

'''''Wellington Bomber''''' is a 2010 [[television documentary]] film about the record attempt and accompanying newsreel.&lt;ref name=ThisIsKent11Jul2010/&gt;

The 1 hour documentary was commissioned by the BBC's digital channel [[BBC Four]] and produced by  Peter Williams' company Peter Williams Television, with Williams and Cassian Harrison of the BBC acting as executive producers.&lt;ref name=ThisIsKent11Jul2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCPressOffice1Sep2010WellingtonBomber/&gt; Williams directed the programme, assisted by Stephen Hopkins and Jo Taylor, with Paul Meadows as editor.&lt;ref name=ThisIsKent11Jul2010/&gt; Having tracked down workers who originally worked on the record attempt, according to the BBC "Their story of the excitement of the attempt is the heart of this documentary."&lt;ref name=BBCFourProgrammesWellingtonBomber/&gt;

The programme formed part of the BBC's Battle Of Britain season, marking the 70th anniversary of the battle with special programmes across [[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]] and [[BBC Four]].&lt;ref name=BBCFourProgrammesWellingtonBomber/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCPressOfficeTVWeek371"/&gt; It was first broadcast on BBC Four at 8 p.m. on Tuesday, 14 September 2010, and then at 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on BBC Two on Sunday 19 September.&lt;ref name=BBCFourProgrammesWellingtonBomber/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCPressOfficeTVWeek371"/&gt;

===Participants===
The documentary featured a number of original Broughton workers and their descendants as well as the author and historian [[Max Hastings]] who had written ''Bomber Command'' (described by the narrator as a "definitive work" on [[RAF Bomber Command]]). Of the workers two had appeared in the original newsreel. An RAF Wellington pilot also contributed.

===Format===
The location for the documentary film is an evening at the Broughton factory, where several of the original workers and their relatives have met to view a screening of the original newsreel in a small cinema room. Eleven of the original workers and their relatives were interviewed in the documentary, while the visible group present at the cinema numbered at least 30. It is stated that the screening was the first time many of them had seen the newsreel.

The documentary featured narrated archive footage and pictures interwoven with shots of the original newsreel being screened and of parts of the newsreel itself, supplemented with interviews with the workers and their relatives, pre-recorded in their homes. In addition, there is a large amount of interview material interwoven with this, from both Cooling and Hastings. Cooling is also interviewed in a home setting, while Hastings is interviewed at the [[Brooklands Museum]] in Surrey, site of another wartime Wellington factory, inside one of only two preserved Wellington bombers, N2980.

===Content===
The film covered the design of the bomber by [[Barnes Wallis]] and the background behind its urgent operational need and thus necessity of easy and quick manufacture. Brooklands Museum's Wellington N2980 is covered in detail. The film discussed the Wellington in service, the daily lives and roles of the bomber crews, with Hastings telling how pilots named the bomber "The Wimpy" after the contemporary cartoon character [[J. Wellington Wimpy]]. It had a resilience to [[flak]] and could ride out trouble, albeit Hastings said that aircrews were still more likely to die than survive a 30-mission tour. Cooling told how his first flight returned with petrol leaking out of a fuel tank, with the pilot simply remarking they were 'back in time for [[Last call (bar term)|last orders]]'; the crew were flying again within two days.

The film covered the Broughton factory, a [[shadow factory]] which built many of the 11,461 Wellington bombers built. Its production line, its aircraft hangar, its assembly lines, parts storage systems and component assembly hangars, and the processes of stitching and doping, were shown. It discussed the production line organisation, and that some assembly work such as electrical panels had actually been prepared beforehand for the record attempt. The film covered air raids on the factory and the measures taken to prevent injury or damage, including a system of amber and red warning lights, and the illumination of nearby hills to fool German bombers. With all regular forces committed in theatre, security at the factory was provided by the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]], who also escorted workers as they undertook snagging work to finished aircraft on the neighbouring fields into which they were distributed with wide spacings.

It covered the role of women at the factory, who made up half the workforce, and why they were [[Mobilization|mobilised]] to work though many had no experience of such work but were soon training new workers themselves, and how most were motivated by having male relatives involved in the fighting. It described the general patriotic feeling and productive urge felt among workers, in light of German bombing and propaganda efforts, such as the 1940 broadcasts of [[Lord Haw Haw]]. By contrast, it also discussed the problems of instances of low morale, absenteeism, death, and the effect of industrial relations movements since the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 general strike]], and the Labour Acts used to bring in Scottish workers. Dance music was piped into the hangars to boost morale, while the factory had its own doctor, dentist and barber, and employed strict control of comfort breaks. 
It covered the hardships of working long shifts at the factory, and of [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|wartime rationing]]. Other hazards included walking and driving home in the dark due to raids and the remote location.  The workers' scant free time was discussed; they danced and enjoyed radio programs, such as [[Arthur Askey]] and ''[[Workers' Playtime (radio programme)|Workers' Playtime]]'' and ''[[It's That Man Again]]''.

In terms of the wider political context, it discussed the buildup to war and the approach of [[Neville Chamberlain]], the Prime Minister until May 1940, and featured cabinet papers showing concern over the German effect on production, the domain of  [[Lord Beaverbrook]], the [[Minister of Aircraft Production]]. The documentary also covered the role of [[propaganda]] newsreels in the war effort. According to the documentary, a North American narrator was chosen for the newsreel to be shown in America, to show them that the British were also manufacturing efficiently while under attack, and to not only show them that Brits "could take it", but that they could "dish it out as well". According to Hastings it had probably been a Wellington force that had caused an air raid warning in [[Berlin]], just as the visiting Russian ambassador [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] was being reassured by [[Hitler]] that the British were near defeat.

In the wider civilian context, the film dealt with the effects of domestic bomb damage and air raids, and air raid shelters, and the role of [[Mining in Wales|Welsh coal mining]], a [[Reserved occupation|reserved industry]] supporting production at Broughton, with Ben Motram having been a coal miner at [[Llay]] main colliery, the deepest mine in Europe at the time, with wife Constance employed as a seamstress at the factory.

In the wider military context, the film covered the [[Battle of Britain]] and German raids on [[Battle of Britain airfields|south eastern RAF airfields]], followed by the sequence of the British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] ordering a raid on Berlin after a German raid damaged parts of London housing, which (it claimed) led to Hitler switching raids to cities, which while devastating for civilians, took pressure off the RAF. Further on the film relayed the progress of the [[Western Front (World War II)|ground and aerial fighting in Europe]], and covered German [[Luftwaffe]] raids on the [[Channel Ports]] and [[Dunkirk]].

====Postwar====
[[File:Airbus Wing Factory - geograph.org.uk - 46746.jpg|thumb|right|The Broughton site is now an [[Airbus]] factory]]
Moving to after the [[Victory in Europe Day|end of war in Europe]], the film related how the factory was then put to use making [[Prefabricated building|prefab houses]] and how, while many single women workers were retained, all the married women were made redundant. There were stories about the success or otherwise of the resulting reunions with their husbands returning home from the fighting, moving forward into [[Demobilization of the British Armed Forces after World War II|demobilized]] civilian life. Linking the Broughton factory of the present day to the time of the war, the film included footage of the present day Airbus operations at the site, including the manufacturing process and the loading of parts onto the [[Airbus Beluga]] transport aircraft. Stories of long-serving employers were included, and of an employee of the old factory whose grandson now works at the Airbus plant.&lt;ref name=BBCPressOfficeTVWeek371/&gt;

====Dedications====
Towards the end of the documentary, there is also extended footage of [[Air Forces Memorial]] at [[Runnymede]], used as the backdrop as Cooling recites a poem he wrote. The documentary closes with an on screen dedication to "Flt Lt Rupert “Tiny” Cooling (1920–2010) and to the wartime workers on the Broughton production line".
