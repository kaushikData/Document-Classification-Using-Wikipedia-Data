'''One Wall Street''' (originally the '''[[Irving Trust Company]] Building''', then the '''[[Bank of New York]] Building''' after 1988, and now known as the '''BNY Mellon Building''' since 2007), is an [[Art-Deco]]-style skyscraper in [[Lower Manhattan]], [[New York City]].  It is located in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] on the corner of [[Wall Street]] and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]].  Up until September 30, 2015, it served as the global headquarters of [[The Bank of New York Mellon]] Corporation.  In May, 2014, the bank sold the building to a joint venture led by [[Harry B. Macklowe]]'s Macklowe Properties for $585 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-21/bny-mellon-reaches-deal-for-585-million-office-sale | work=Bloomberg | first=David M | last=Levitt | title=BNY Mellon Reaches Deal for $585 Million Office Sale | date=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture==
Designed by [[Ralph Thomas Walker|Ralph Walker]], the building was originally built for the Irving Trust Company. It is an [[Art Deco]] architectural style, with a [[steel frame|steel skeleton]] whose [[facade]] is covered in [[limestone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ci.columbia.edu/0240s/0242_3/0242_3_s2_7_text.html Columbia class text]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the curves in the wall, the bank does not completely occupy its full building lot.  By municipal law, unoccupied and unmarked land would revert to the public, which is the reason for a number of small markers embedded in the sidewalk asserting the limits of the building's lot.  It counts fifty stories (originally planned for 46),&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19689774/news_of_bankers_and_banks/|title=News of Bankers and Banks|last=|first=|date=1928-05-02|work=Brooklyn Eagle|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en|via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{OpenAccess}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; stands 654 feet (199 meters) tall, and measures 1,165,659 rentable square feet.
[[File:48-wall-street2.jpg|thumb|upright|Entrance to One Wall Street]]
The Wall Street entrance leads into a two-story banking hall whose ceiling is decorated with red and gold mosaics designed by [[Hildreth Meiere]], comparable to the mosaics in the Golden Hall of [[Stockholm City Hall]], and manufactured by the same company, the [[Ravenna Mosaic Company]] in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/classes/finearts/nyc/wall/irving.html NYU class description]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The previous high-rise on this corner, also called '''One Wall Street''', was erected in 1907 as a slender 18-story office building.  The investors, a syndicate from St. Louis, headed by Festus Wade of the St Louis Mercantile Trust Company, paid $700,000 for the 1,131 square foot property, before construction costs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19689547/sale_of_chimney_building_plot_recalls/|title=Sale of Chimney Building Plot Recalls Ownership of Late Benjamin D. Silliman|last=|first=|date=1928-02-09|work=Brooklyn Eagle|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en|via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{OpenAccess}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architects were [[Barnett, Haynes &amp; Barnett]] of St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When Downtown Real Estate Turned Upward|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/realestate/when-downtown-real-estate-turned-upward.html|website=New York Times|accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Number One Wall Street|date=16 June 1906|publisher=Real Estate Record and Builders' Guide, Volume 77|page=1140|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6bzO6uzqcqkC&amp;pg=PA1140|accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Known as the "'''Chimney Building'''"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or "'''Chimney Corner'''",&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; it was acquired and razed as part of Irving Trust's real estate consolidation around 1929. Irving Trust was then known as American Exchange Irving Trust, and it bought the original corner property along with a number of adjacent lots on either side, to create a 180 foot frontage along Broadway, and the entire block along Wall Street.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The "chimney" property was at that time the costliest transaction per square foot recorded in the city, at $1,050,000.

Construction on the present building began in 1929 and was completed in 1931,&lt;ref name=desrep /&gt; to the designs of the architectural firm of [[Voorhees, Gmelin and Walker]]. A time study of the construction was photographed form the vantage point of the [[Trinity Court Building]] a block away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cca.qc.ca/en/collection/525-irving-trust-building-new-york|title=Irving Trust Building, New York {{!}} Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914231838/http://www.cca.qc.ca/en/collection/525-irving-trust-building-new-york|archive-date=2010-09-14|access-date=2010-02-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1963 and 1965,&lt;ref name="desrep"&gt;[[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] [http://www.neighborhoodpreservationcenter.org/db/bb_files/2001OneWallStreet.pdf "One Wall Street Designation Report"] (March 6, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; a 36-floor addition to the site was constructed to the south of the tower to provide extra office space. This site had been occupied by the eighteen-story [[Manhattan Life Insurance Building]] (1894), which was the title-holder as the tallest building in the world from 1894 until 1899,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Korom | first = Joseph A. | year = 2008 | title = The American skyscraper, 1850-1940: a celebration of height | publisher = Branden Books | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JVzYO1TyZ6AC&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=%22Manhattan%20Life%20Insurance%20Building%22&amp;pg=PA198#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Manhattan%20Life%20Insurance%20Building%22&amp;f=false | isbn = 978-0-8283-2188-4 | page = 432 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the twenty-two story Knickerbocker Trust Company Building (1909). Among other alterations was the chiseling out of "Irving Trust" name from the cornerstone and replacement with "Bank of New York." The last owner of the Chimney Building, the Central Union Trust Company, had also owned the Manhattan Life building, and had moved there in 1929 upon the sale to Irving.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
  
The building has had numerous problems with the limestone exterior, and in 2001, the building's owners decided to bring in [[Hoffmann Architects]] to conduct a survey of the exterior and provide a five-year masterplan consisting of mortar repair and window replacements.

After the sale to Macklowe Properties, it was reported that the building would be converted to [[condominium]]s, rental apartments, and retail space.&lt;ref&gt;http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2014/11/20/macklowe_to_convert_one_wall_street_into_condos_and_rentals.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Administration of the Autonomous Communities''', also known as '''Autonomous Administration''', is a [[Public Administration of Spain]]. It belongs to the second level of the Public Administrations, because it exerts its powers within the limits of each [[Autonomous communities of Spain|Autonomous Community]].

It is integrated by:

* Central Organization (Government of the Autonomous Community or Council of Government, the President of the Autonomous Communities, the Vicepresident and the Councilors).
* Peripheral Administration (Territorial Delegations of the Autonomous Communities, Sectoral Delegations of the Government Departments).

The Autonomic Administration has a very broad level of competence, based on the [[decentralization |decentralization]] of the State or through the State of Autonomies. As for the level of competences, they are not always the same, and are regulated in each [[Statute of Autonomy]] for each [[Autonomous Community]], making in some cases the level of competences is higher than those of a [[Federal state]].

It should also be taken into account that the Autonomous Community has its own [[legislative body]], and that the autonomous administration must behave before it like any other [[executive power]], respecting the rules issued by its autonomous parliament.

In the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] it is regulated in Chapter Three, entitled "of the Autonomous Communities". This Chapter regulates the form of creation and authorization of the Autonomous Communities, the elaboration of its Statutes, the powers transferred to the Autonomous Communities, the powers of the State, its resources and its financing.

==Structure==
Like the [[General State Administration]], the Autonomous Administration is regulated by Law 40/2015 and the structure is practically the same.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-10566 Ley 40/2015, de 1 de octubre, de Régimen Jurídico del Sector Público.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it can vary from one Autonomous Community to another depending on the provisions in the Statute of Autonomy. Here the common organs are exposed:

===Central Organization===
====Government====
The Autonomous Government is the executive power of the [[Autonomous community of Spain|Autonomous Community]]. As in the [[Government of Spain|Central Government]] it responds before its [[parliament]] (autonomic parliament). The Government directs the Autonomous Administration within its competences. 

Contrary to what happens with the Central Government, the decisions taken by the Executive are not sanctioned by the [[King of spain|King]], and it is the President of the Autonomous Community who signs the laws and decisions on his behalf.

====President====
The President of the Autonomous Community is the head of the executive power as well as the highest authority of the Autonomous Community. He directs the Autonomous Government, elects its Vice President and Councilors and decides the policies that the government carries out.

As at the State level, the President may elect more than one Vice President and may freely separate his Vice-Presidents and Councilors. If the President is ceased, they cease with him.

====Councilors====
The Councilors of the Autonomous Community are like the [[Minister (government)|Ministers]] of the Central Government. They lead a ''Consejería'' (government department as a [[Ministry (government department)|Ministry]]). Councilor work in their governamental area and appoint the members of their department like Vice Councilors, General Directors...etc

The figure of the Vice Councilor or Deputy Councilor is not always present, because it is the decision of the Councilor to exist or not this position and, in Autonomous Communities of small size where the work is not much, often these positions do not exist.

====General Directors====
The General Directorates are management departmental bodies and steering bodies, hierarchically inferior to the Councilors or Vice Councirlos (if they exist). The holder must have a degree of competence and professional experience, and will be selected from career officials of the State, Autonomous Communities or Local entities, also demanding the title of Doctor, Licensee, Engineer, Architect or equivalent. It should be noted that the Royal Decree on the structure of the Department may omit the first requirement because it is a General Directorate whose exceptional characteristics require that the holder does not have the status of official of the State.

====Cabinets====
They are consultation bodies generally composed of a technical secretary and several technicians who support the President, Vicepresident, Councilors, ect. in their relations with institutions, in making decisions and performing special advisory tasks in a particular branch of knowledge.

===Peripheral Administration===
====Territorial Delegations====
The Territorial Delegations of the Autonomous Communities carry out the same activity as the Delegations of the Central Government. They are administrative bodies whose head is a high position appointed in the discretion of the Autonomous Government. He is in charge of the management of the Autonomous Administration in some of the territorial divisions of the Autonomous Communities, such as the [[Provinces of Spain|Province]].

====Sectoral Delegations====
The Sectoral Delegations of the Consejerías are organs that represent the different Departments of an autonomous government. The holder must have a degree of competence and professional experience, and will be selected from career officials of the State, Autonomous Communities or Local entities, also demanding the title of Doctor, Licensee, Engineer, Architect or equivalent

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2458">A '''banishment room''' (also known as a '''chasing-out-room''' and a '''boredom room''') is a modern [[employee exit management]] strategy whereby employees are transferred to another department where they are assigned meaningless work until they become disheartened enough to quit.&lt;ref name=Torres&gt;{{cite news|last=Torres|first=Ida|title=Japanese companies using ‘banishment rooms’ to push employees to resign|url=http://japandailypress.com/japanese-companies-using-banishment-rooms-to-push-employees-to-resign-3029793/|accessdate=24 August 2013|newspaper=Japan Daily Press|date=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ASAHI&gt;{{cite news|title=BANISHMENT ROOM: Top companies under investigation over unfair labor practices|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201301290071|accessdate=23 August 2013|newspaper=THE ASAHI SHIMBUN|date=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TABUCHI&gt;{{cite news|last=TABUCHI|first=HIROKO|title=Layoffs Taboo, Japan Workers Are Sent to the Boredom Room|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/17/business/global/layoffs-illegal-japan-workers-are-sent-to-the-boredom-room.html|accessdate=23 August 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the resignation is voluntary, the employee would not be eligible for certain benefits. The legality and ethicality of the practice is questionable and may be construed as [[constructive dismissal]] in some regions.

The practice, which is not officially acknowledged, is common in [[Japan]] which has strong labor laws and a tradition of [[permanent employment]].

[[File:BOB logo 72dpi.jpg|thumb|300px|BOB's Logo, created by Vancouver-based Karo in 2006]]
'''Building Opportunities with Business Inner-City Society''' (AKA Building Opportunities with Business or BOB) is a non-profit organization that has been active in [[Vancouver]]'s [[Downtown Eastside]], Chinatown, Strathcona, Mt Pleasant, Gastown and Downtown South areas since October 2005. BOB's goal according to its website is "to support local business development and increase job opportunities for inner-city residents by championing an inclusive revitalization process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buildingopportunities.org/ |title=BOB &amp;#124; Building Opportunities with Business |publisher=Buildingopportunities.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creating BOB==
[[File:BOBinnercity.png|thumb|left|300px|Vancouver's inner city. The dark grey areas are where BOB's efforts are focused as per the Vancouver Agreement.]]
The creation of BOB came as a direct result of the Vancouver Agreement&lt;ref name="vancouveragreement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouveragreement.ca/TheAgreement.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050316205956/http://www.vancouveragreement.ca/TheAgreement.htm|archive-date=2005-03-16|dead-url=yes|title=TheAgreement|accessdate=2014-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an urban development initiative between the governments of Canada, British Columbia, and the City of Vancouver. BOB's role as defined by the agreement is to promote business development, offer mentoring and employment training as well as administering a loans program to inner-city small businesses.&lt;ref name="vancouveragreement2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouveragreement.ca/EconomicDevelopment.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125000156/http://www.vancouveragreement.ca/EconomicDevelopment.htm|archive-date=2005-11-25|dead-url=yes|title=EconomicDevelopment|accessdate=2014-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the time since its creation the organization has developed from being seen largely as an employment agency into being recognized as a credible and reliable source for a variety of information on the DTES. Separating itself from the legacy or failures of PEACH, the economic development and job creation organization that BOB was created to replace and distinguishing itself as a separate and unique entity has been a challenge to the organization. While some of the people and resources from PEACH were transferred to BOB the organization was created as a comprehensive new service to address the needs of business and employment. Fast Track to Employment (FTE)another organization active in the DTES has remained its own agency working in tandem with BOB. With a mandate to create employment opportunities by working with employers and residents FTE operates within the BOB offices as an affiliated or sister charitable organization sharing the same board of directors as BOB.

BOB as an organization has made efforts in the media to clarify its role in the DTES while addressing a diverse range of policy and planning issues relevant to Vancouver's inner-city such as STIR (Short Term Incentives for Rental Housing)&lt;ref&gt;Stir is a step in the right direction, Shirley Chan, ''Vancouver Sun'', 2009 https://vancouversun.com/opinion/STIR+step+right+direction/2373405/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; homelessness and economic development&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Levitz, Hope and despair in Vancouver's Eastside, ''The Canadian Press, CTV'', Monday December 28, 2009 http://www.ctvolympics.ca/news-centre/newsid=23996.html&lt;/ref&gt; and industry clustering&lt;ref&gt;Clustering in Action, Robert Matas, ''Globe and Mail'', December 18, 2009 http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20091218.escenic_1406276/BNStory/National/&lt;/ref&gt; Though becoming more widely recognized in 2008 and 2009 the organization has struggled to overcome obscurity concerning its past and present work.

Directly related to its support of clustering in Vancouver's inner-city, BOB has also been noted for its co-working space&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shaw |first=Gillian |url=http://communities.canada.com/vancouversun/blogs/techsense/archive/2009/12/18/vancouver-s-downtown-eastside-gets-innovative-cowork-space.aspx |title=Vancouver's Downtown Eastside gets innovative coworking space - Digital Life |publisher=Communities.canada.com |date=2009-12-18 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shaw |first=Gillian |url=https://vancouversun.com/shared+workspace+opens+Vancouver+inner+city/2366408/story.html |title=New shared workspace opens in Vancouver's inner city |publisher=Vancouversun.com |date=2009-12-21 |accessdate=2010-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531062700/http://www.vancouversun.com/shared%2Bworkspace%2Bopens%2BVancouver%2Binner%2Bcity/2366408/story.html |archivedate=May 31, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; made available for bloggers, independent media/social media, as well as independent contractors and consultants working in Vancouver's DTES.(Downtown Eastside) The BOB co-working space is also utilized as an art gallery and presentation space and is an official host gallery of the 2010 Winter Olympics' Cultural Olympiad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/more-2010-information/cultural-festivals-and-events/event-listings/trimpin--sheng-high_131960nR.html |title=Trimpin: Sheng High - Event Listings : Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics |publisher=Vancouver2010.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has also been noted for placing focus on social enterprise in the inner-city and was instrumental in the support and creation of the SOLEFood Inner City Farm Project along with Seann Dory of United We Can, and local property owners Gudy and Pal Sahota.&lt;ref name="kelowna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kelowna.com/2009/10/31/new-community-garden-takes-root-in-the-downtown-eastside/|title=Kelowna News, Weather, Business, Sports, Entertainment, Classifieds, Real Estate &amp; More &amp;#124; Kelowna.com|publisher=kelowna.com|accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christabel Shaler |url=http://www.vancouverobserver.com/blogs/comfortvschange/2009/11/01/solefood-inner-city-farm-source-food-and-jobs-vancouvers-dowtown |title=SOLEfood Inner City Farm: A Source of Food and Jobs for Vancouver's Dowtown Eastside &amp;#124; The Vancouver Observer - News, Culture, Sports, Blogs in Vancouver, BC |publisher=The Vancouver Observer |date=2009-11-01 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.canada.com/vancouvercourier/news/story.html?id=85e2e05a-d62c-4f0a-8ecd-f7071f9a045d |title=Sitemap - Vancouver Courier |publisher=.canada.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BOB and the Millennium CBA (Vancouver 2010 Olympic Village)==

BOB was involved in the creation of Vancouver's first [[Community Benefits Agreement]] centred on the construction of the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Village.&lt;ref name="vancouver1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vancouver.ca/olympicvillage/pdf/CBAFactsheet.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328052745/http://vancouver.ca/olympicvillage/PDF/CBAFactsheet.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While this development has been criticized for going over-budget&lt;ref&gt;Olympic village $130&amp;nbsp;million over budget: audit, Miro Cernetig,''Vancouver Sun'', October 6, 2009 https://vancouversun.com/business/Vancouver+Olympic+Village+million+over+budget+report/2072466/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; the CBA may potentially serve as a valuable example of the emerging potential between investors, developers and social enterprise in urban planning. The CBA was a collective effort between the City of Vancouver, BOB, [[Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games|VANOC]] and Millennium Development Corporation focusing on job creation for local residents and encouraging direct procurement of goods and services from the Downtown Eastside as per the needs of the Olympic Village development.&lt;ref name="vancouver1"/&gt; Other major partners included Bell, [[VanCity Credit Union]], the [[Province of British Columbia]] and the Federal Government (as represented through the Vancouver agreement)as well as the Canadian Housing and Mortgage Corporation and the Vancouver Regional Construction Association.

==Criticism of BOB==

BOB has been the recipient of criticism from both activists who view the organization as a potential agent of gentrification and from other individuals active in the DTES. The organization has made efforts to clarify its role in the DTES in response to these criticisms.&lt;ref name="canada1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.canada.com/vancouvercourier/news/story.html?id=eecc5d8e-977f-43d6-b31b-1b406fc20f9d |title=Sitemap - Vancouver Courier |publisher=.canada.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; PEACH (Partners for Economic and Community Health) having been proven largely ineffective in its approach was dismantled and its funding halted. BOB, though supporting a different development model and with different roles has also been viewed by some in Vancouver's DTES as not serving its primary purpose or being effective enough in job creation.&lt;ref name="canada2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.canada.com/vancouvercourier/news/story.html?id=cda5b861-4837-487f-b5da-852f4d282cca |title=Sitemap - Vancouver Courier |publisher=.canada.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim Kerr, executive director for the [[Downtown Eastside Residents Association]] and Vancouver employment councilor Ruth Meta are examples of vocal critics.&lt;ref name="canada1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="canada2"/&gt; Meta and BOB CEO Shirley Chan both commented on BOB's role and work in the DTES through a series of articles in the Vancouver Courier in 2009&lt;ref name="canada1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.canada.com/vancouvercourier/news/letters/story.html?id=87989020-6e69-4926-b944-cf4a0bdef158 |title=Sitemap - Vancouver Courier |publisher=.canada.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is rumored that Meta reconciled with BOB after this exchange.

[[File:Camel Race Track Qatar.jpg|thumb|right|[[Al-Shahaniya]], Qatar's largest camel racing track]]

'''Camel racing''' is a popular sport in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, Jordan, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman,  Australia, and Mongolia. Professional camel racing, like [[horse racing]], is an event for [[betting]] and tourist attraction. [[Camel]]s can run at speeds up to 65&amp;nbsp;km/h (18&amp;nbsp;m/s; 40&amp;nbsp;mph) in short sprints and they can maintain a speed of 40&amp;nbsp;km/h (11&amp;nbsp;m/s; 25&amp;nbsp;mph) for an hour.
Camels are often controlled by child jockeys, but allegations of human rights abuses have led to nationwide bans on underage labor in the [[UAE]] and [[Qatar]]. In modern camel racing, camels are often controlled by [[Robot jockey|remote controlled robotic whips]].

A major camel race is the [[Camel Cup]] held at [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory|Alice Springs]] which is the second biggest prize purse camel race in Australia. It is held annually and includes not only the camel races themselves, but also a collection of market stalls and other entertainment.

The biggest [[prize money]] camel race in Australia is "The Boulia desert Sands" with a A$25,000 prize purse in Queensland.

==Child jockeys==
Children are often favored as jockeys because of their light weight. It has been reported that thousands of children (some reported as young as 2 years old) are [[human trafficking|trafficked]] from countries such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Pakistan,India and Sudan for use as jockeys for camel racing industry in [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2005/46606.htm 2005 U.S. State Department Trafficking in Persons Report]. State.gov. Retrieved 2011-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates range of 5,000 – 40,000 child camel jockeys in the Persian Gulf region.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Williamson, Lucy.

Some countries have issued penalties for those who trafficked child camel jockeys and ordered the owners responsibilities for returning the children back to their home countries. However, they report that in many instances the children rescued were those who had been sold away by their own parents in exchange for money or a job abroad. If they were returned, the children would again be sold for the same purposes. Other children did not speak their native languages, or did not know how to live outside the camel farms.

A prominent activist for rehabilitation and recovery of the jockeys is Pakistani lawyer [[Ansar Burney]]. He has focused a portion of his work on eliminating the use of child jockeys.

===Banning===
The United Arab Emirates was the first to ban the use of children under 15 as jockeys in camel racing when [[Sheikh]] [[Hamdan bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan|Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan]] announced the ban on 29 July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data/theuae/2005/May/theuae_May691.xml&amp;section=theuae UAE enforces stringent steps to eradicate child jockeys] (Wam), ''[[Khaleej Times]]'', 24 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the UAE paid compensation to 879 former jockeys.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Dean.

The '''Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity''' (formerly the '''International Advertising Festival''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Cannes Lions: From Advertising to Creativity|url=http://thehitboard.com/2011/06/27/2011-cannes-lions-from-advertising-to-creativity/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Cannes Lions 2011 Review|url=http://www.brandify.co.uk/unbranded/canneslions2011/}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a global event for those working in creative communications, advertising, and related fields.

The five-day festival, incorporating the awarding of the Lions awards, is held yearly at the [[Palais des Festivals et des Congrès]] in [[Cannes]], [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canneslions.com/about/news.cfm?newsid=87 News | About Us | Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011133249/http://www.canneslions.com/about/news.cfm?newsid=87 |date=October 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each June, around 11,000 registered delegates from 90 countries visit the Festival to celebrate the best of creativity in brand communication, discuss industry issues, and network with one another.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jun/20/cannes-festival-rebrands-digital-age?INTCMP=SRCH | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Mark | last=Sweney | title=Cannes advertising festival rebrands to reflect digital age | date=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jun/22/cannes-lions-martin-sorrell-wpp | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Mark | last=Sweney | title=Sir Martin Sorrell: Cannes Lions is 'a chance to get away' | date=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The week's activities include multiple award ceremonies as well as an opening and closing gala.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canneslions.com/festival/whats_on.cfm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011131757/http://www.canneslions.com/festival/whats_on.cfm |date=October 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Business/Business-News/2013/06/08/Cannes-Lions-attracts-record-number-of-entries.aspx |title=Cannes Lions attracts record number of entries - Business News &amp;#124; The Star Online |publisher=Thestar.com.my |date=2013-06-08 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Inspired by the [[Cannes Film Festival]], staged in Cannes since the late 1940s, a group of cinema screen advertising contractors belonging to the Screen Advertising World Association (Sawa) felt the makers of advertising films should be similarly recognised. They established the International Advertising Film Festival, the first of which took place in [[Venice]], [[Italy]], in September 1954, with 187 film entries from 14 countries. The lion of the [[Piazza San Marco]] in Venice was the inspiration for the Lion trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Advertising 20 - A Cannes Lion|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/analysis/1076691/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tungate|first1=Mark|title=Adland: A Global History of Advertising|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=7J3JeXJ7ITgC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;lpg=PA229&amp;dq=cannes+lion+winged&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=A0HHyP_M2J&amp;sig=Jw9vlTi8gGN042Fo1rOXLsbr8RM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic2JOmiIfYAhWs1IMKHfGrD1U4ChDoAQg2MAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=cannes%20lion%20winged&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second festival was held in [[Monte Carlo]], and the third in Cannes. After that, the event alternated between Venice and Cannes before settling in the latter in 1984.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.adweek.com/cannes-lions-2011/history-cannes-lions-ad-films-carnival-creativity-132774 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822164555/http://www.adweek.com/cannes-lions-2011/history-cannes-lions-ad-films-carnival-creativity-132774 |date=August 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; New categories have been awards in recent years: the Press &amp; Outdoor Lions competition in 1992; the Cyber Lions in 1998 (retired after 2017); Media Lions in 1999; Direct Lions in 2002; Radio, and Titanium Lions in 2005; Promo &amp; Activation Lions in 2006 (retired after 2017); Design Lions in 2008; PR Lions in 2009; Film Craft in 2010; Creative Effectiveness in 2011;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Branded Content &amp; Entertainment and Mobile Lions in 2012; Innovation in 2013 and Creative eCommerce and Social &amp; Influencer in 2018. However, in recent years, there have been calls from within the industry for the Festival to simplify the entry categories to better reflect the current state of the modern communications world.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://creativity-online.com/news/categories-schmategories/228440 |title=Categories, Schmategories - Cannes 2011 |publisher=Creativity Online |date=2011-06-27 |accessdate=2014-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213094147/http://creativity-online.com/news/categories-schmategories/228440 |archive-date=2014-02-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival responded by introducing changes in 2018, including new categories, revising costs and reducing the event from seven days to five.

In the 1990s, the Festival also added a programme of learning in the form of seminars and workshops.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Over the years, this side of the Festival has grown considerably, and in 2013 it featured around 130 sessions over 7 days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canneslions.com/the_festival/programme/festival_programme.cfm The Festival | Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914214933/http://www.canneslions.com/the_festival/programme/festival_programme.cfm |date=2013-09-14 }}[http://www.canneslions.com/festival/full_schedule.cfm?filter=1,2,3 &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included talks from [[Christopher Bailey (fashion designer)|Christopher Bailey]], [[Jack Black]], [[Jenson Button]], [[Nick Cannon]], [[Shepard Fairey]], [[Arianna Huffington]], [[David Karp]], and [[Annie Leibovitz]].

In 2004, British publisher and conference organiser EMAP plc (now called [[Ascential]]) purchased the festival from French businessman [[Roger Hatchuel]] - who had started managing it in 1987 - for a reported [[pound sterling|£]]52 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Emap buys Cannes advertising festival|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/aug/10/emap.advertising | location=London | work=The Guardian|first1=Phil|last1=Sommerich|first2=Jane|last2=Martinson|date=10 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014, the ''Wall Street Journal''&lt;ref&gt;Jack Marshall, [https://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/06/18/ad-agency-spoofs-cannes-for-promo-videos/ "Ad Agency Spoofs Cannes for Promo Videos featuring Nimrod Kamer"], Wall Street Journal, June 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''Campaign Magazine''&lt;ref&gt;Ben Hall, [http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/1299546/Watch-Satirist-takes-Sir-Martin-Sorrell-joins-Kanye-Wests-entourage/ "Watch: Satirist takes on Sir Martin Sorrell and joins Kanye West's entourage"], Campaign Magazine, June 19, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; reported on [[Nimrod Kamer]]'s protestations at Cannes Lions.

Jose Papa is the managing director. Philip Thomas is chairman and the chief executive officer of Ascential Events, under which Cannes Lions operates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cannes Lions appoints new CEO |url=http://www.bandt.com.au/news/cannes-lions-appoints-new-ceo |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121230081940/http://www.bandt.com.au/news/cannes-lions-appoints-new-ceo |archivedate=2012-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other awards include Holding Company of the Year, Network of the Year, Media Agency of the Year, Agency of the Year, Independent Agency of the Year, Media Person of the Year, [[New Directors' Showcase]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://saatchi.com/en-in/new-directors-showcase/new-directors-showcase-years/ |title=New Directors' Showcase |publisher=Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Global}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertiser of the Year, and the Palme d'Or to the best production company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canneslions.com/enter/rules_fees.cfm?section_id=59 Enter the Awards | Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112085001/http://www.canneslions.com/enter/rules_fees.cfm?section_id=59 |date=November 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertisements are generally entered by the agencies that created them, although technically anyone can enter any advertising creation, providing it ran within a specified time frame. The jurors are instructed to reward advertising that is deemed most creative both in idea and execution.

In an article in ''The Guardian'' in 2009, WPP boss Sir [[Martin Sorrell]] said the Cannes Lions awards were too costly to enter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jul/07/sir-martin-sorrell-cannes-lions-cost-wpp | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Mark | last=Sweney | title=Sir Martin Sorrell criticises Cannes Lions on cost and new category | date=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a year later, he also admitted that he had made sure that WPP was "very, very focused on Cannes" and wanted to be "the leader in terms of awards at Cannes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.hillandknowlton.com/cannes/tv/ |title=Cannes Eye TV › Cannes Eye |publisher=Blogs.hillandknowlton.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222220602/http://blogs.hillandknowlton.com/cannes/tv/ |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, WPP won the first Holding Company of the Year prize at the Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shots.net/news/awards-festivals-events/70330/nike-writes-itself-into-history.html |title=Cannes Lions 2011: Nike Writes Itself into History, Awards, Festivals &amp; Events, News |publisher=Shots.net |date=2011-06-26 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on this industry recognition, WPP Worldwide Creative Director, John O'Keeffe, said:

"Cannes is the only global, cross discipline show, covering advertising, design, digital, media, promo, effectiveness, and everything else besides. It doesn't aggregate the scores of other shows, so you can't inflate your ranking on the back of just one or two pieces of work. If you are number one at Cannes, you've done it the hard way, the proper way, the only way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpp.com/wpp/press/press/default.htm?guid={3765e5b6-0ec4-478b-8b4b-24f9b2ab00f4} WPP most creatively-awarded global group in Cannes - WPP] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630010245/http://www.wpp.com/wpp/press/press/default.htm?guid= |date=June 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the "[[Dumb Ways to Die]]" a campaign by [[McCann Australia]] for Australian company [[Metro Trains]] made history by winning a total of five Grands Prix awards, the most ever awarded to a single piece of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/24/us-australia-advertising-die-idUSBRE95N03L20130624 |title=Quirky 'Dumb Ways to Die' campaign sweeps advertising awards |publisher=Reuters |date= 2013-06-24|accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lion of St. Mark (award)|Lion of St. Mark]] is an honour given each year at the [[Cannes Lions]] International Festival of Creativity to "someone who has made outstanding contributions to the creative community."

==Young Lions Competitions==
[[File:Cannes Young Lions Competition Gold Medal.jpg|right|thumb|280px|Cannes Young Lions Competition Gold Medal]]
The Young Lions Competitions (previously known as the Young Creatives competition, which started in 1995) is open to advertising professionals up to 28 years old working in teams of two. The competition takes place during the festival week in Cannes in seven divisions: print, cyber, film, design, young marketers, media, and PR. Regional competitions are held in most countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canneslions.com/resources/downloads/Reps%20Competition%20List%202016.pdf|title=Young Lions Competitions|author=|date=|website=canneslions.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to select teams in the lead-up to the Festival, with winners of these going into the final round of the competitions at Cannes Lions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.canneslions.com/school/Competitions/ "YOUNG LIONS COMPETITIONS: How to take part"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502185136/http://www.canneslions.com/school/Competitions |date=2016-05-02 }}, canneslions.com&lt;/ref&gt; A design competition was launched in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canneslions.com/talent_training/competitions.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001152644/http://www.canneslions.com/talent_training/competitions.cfm |date=October 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lions Health==
In June 2012, Cannes Lions announced that it plans to launch a new two-day event for creative communications in healthcare, wellness, and sustainability. Taking place in the Palais des Festivals in Cannes, France, just before Cannes Lions kicks off on 15 June 2014, the event will offer two days of content that will explore and debate the essential and unique issues relating to the world of healthcare communications. The move was welcomed by some sections of the industry, with Jeremy Perrott, global creative director of [[McCann Erickson|McCann]] Health, commenting: "Lions Health gives the industry the highest stage to showcase its brilliance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wentz |first=Laurel |url=http://adage.com/article/global-news/cannes-add-lions-health-2014-separate-festival/242071/ |title=Cannes Will Add Lions Health in 2014 In Separate Festival &amp;#124; Global News - Advertising Age |publisher=Adage.com |date=2013-06-12 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 Lions Health was moved to take place at the same time as the main festival, but remains a standalone event in another part of the Palais.[https://www.prweek.com/article/1450473/lions-health-remain-separate-cannes-revamp]

'''Carlos Casado del Alisal''' (March 16, 1833 — June 29, 1899) was a [[Spanish Argentine]] businessman.

==Life and times==

Carlos Casado del Alisal was born in [[Villada]], [[Palencia Province]], [[Spain]]. He arrived in [[Santa Fe Province]], [[Argentina]] in 1857, and in 1864, was named to the Board of Directors of the newly established [[Central Argentine Railway]] by its chief stockholder, [[William Wheelwright]]. Serving in the [[Rosario]] City Council, he also established the Casado Bank in 1865, and ''Colonia Candelaria'', an [[Agricultural colonies in Argentina|agricultural colony]], in 1870; the latter was later reestablished as [[Casilda]], in honor of his mother. He founded the [[New Bank of Santa Fe|Provincial Bank of Santa Fe]] in 1874, and purchased the highly indebted ''Colonia Caridad'' in 1878, redeveloping it as San Genaro (in honor of his daughter's [[patron saint]], [[Saint Gennaro]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casildavirtual.com.ar/historia1.php Carlos Casado y la historia de la ciudad de Casilda] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722012346/http://www.casildavirtual.com.ar/historia1.php |date=July 22, 2011 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casado arranged the first shipment of Argentine [[wheat]] to [[Europe]] in 1878; the 4,500 tons of wheat had been grown in Candelaria, and were shipped on April 12, 1878.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lbosa.com.ar/lbosa/granos/notas.vsp?nid=4138 La primera exportación de trigo argentino] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706081703/http://www.lbosa.com.ar/lbosa/granos/notas.vsp?nid=4138 |date=July 6, 2011 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently named [[monetary policy]] adviser by President [[Nicolás Avellaneda]], and helped direct national support toward the export of cereal at a time when [[leather]] and [[dried meat]]s earned most of the nation's [[Foreign exchange reserves|foreign exchange]].&lt;ref name=scarecrow&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Argentina''. London: Scarecrow Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; President of the Bank of Santa Fe, he also sat on the boards of the [[Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires]] and the [[Banco Hipotecario|Mortgage Bank]] as the representative for Santa Fe Province stockholders from 1882. Casado founded the [[Santa Fe Western Railway]] in 1883, and the rail line would, by 1890, connect much of the agriculturally-rich province to the [[Port of Rosario]] and the [[Paraná River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bancobsf.com.ar/institucional_historia.asp Nuevo Banco de Santa Fe. ''Historia institucional''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Paraguayan War]], in which Argentina annexed what became [[Formosa Province]] from [[Paraguay]], Casado became of the new province's leading landowners. He died in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1899, at age 66.&lt;ref name=scarecrow/&gt;

Carlos Casado del Alisal was honored with a monument sculpted by [[Eduardo Barnes]], and unveiled at the Rosario headquarters of the Provincial Bank of Santa Fe in 1970.

His brother was the well-known Spanish painter [[José Casado del Alisal]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1349">The '''conical refiner''' is a machine used in the refining of pulp in the papermaking process.  It may also be referred to as a Jordan refiner, after the American inventor Joseph Jordan who patented the device in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=9780080533681|title=Handbook of Pulping and Papermaking|last1=Biermann|first1=C|publisher=Academic Press|date=1996|page=142|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sfZfyEmqs_AC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jordan refiner.jpg|Jordan patent|thumb]]

The conical refiner is a chamber with metal bars mounted around the inside of the container.  The material to be refined is pumped into the chamber at high-pressure rate in order to create an abrasive effect as the material is forced through the machine, abraided by the metal bars.  At the opposite end of the chamber the resulting pulp is pumped out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=197|isbn=9781483279602|title=The Paper-making Machine: Its Invention, Evolution, and Development|last1=Clapperton|first1=R.

'''Cwm Silicon''' (literally ''[[Silicon Valley]]'') is an epithet applied to a region of [[South Wales]] in the far west of [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] that attracted much interest and [[inward investment]] from the technology sector in the early 2000s.{{fact|date=October 2010}}

The future of the area as an important technological centre is now uncertain following the closure of its key [[LG (Korea)|LG]] factory in August 2003.{{fact|date=October 2010}} The area is next to the [[M4 motorway|M4]] and is a centre for high-technology companies, like much of the [[M4 corridor]].

'''Timothy David Dalton Philips''' (born 18 February 1968) is an Irish businessman. He was the CEO of the UK supermarket chain [[Morrisons]] from January 2010 until March 2015, when he was succeeded by [[David Potts (businessman)|David Potts]].  He is currently Chairman of [[Byron Hamburgers]] and Chairman of timber and building merchant The Ridgeon Group, as well as holding a number of advisory and non-executive positions.

==Early life==
Born in Ireland, Philips is the son of a [[County Wicklow]] poultry farmer. He has a BA from University College Dublin, a MBA from Harvard Business School and an honorary Doctorate of Management from Bradford University.

==Career==
His retailing career began in New Zealand, where he began as a store manager.&lt;ref name=BBC8483863/&gt; He then had 11 jobs in 14 countries, including an appointment to [[Jardine Matheson]]'s [[Dairy Farm International Holdings|Dairy Farm International]].&lt;ref name=Times7005426/&gt; He joined [[Walmart]] in 1998, and after working in Brazil, rose to the position of [[Chief Operating Officer]] in Germany. He then joined the [[Weston family]] retail operation as CEO of upmarket Irish department store group [[Brown Thomas]] in 2007, and then becoming Chief Operating Officer of Canadian retailer [[Loblaw]] in January 2007, under [[Allan Leighton]].&lt;ref name=GuardApp/&gt;

After Morrisons CEO [[Marc Bolland]] announced his departure to [[Marks and Spencers]] in December 2009, Philips was appointed in a surprise move as his replacement in January 2010.&lt;ref name=BBC8483863&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8483863.stm|title=Morrisons names Dalton Philips as new chief executive|publisher=BBC News|date=2010-01-28|accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Leighton worked with Morrisons chairman Sir Ian Gibson during his tenure at [[Asda]], and is good friends with founder [[Ken Morrison|Sir Ken Morrison]].&lt;ref name=GuardApp&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/27/morrisons-new-chief|title=Morrisons appoints Irishman Dalton Philips as new chief executive|publisher=The Guardian|date=2010-01-28|accessdate=2010-01-28 | location=London | first=Zoe | last=Wood}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Times7005426&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/retailing/article7005426.ece|title=Morrisons names its new chief but keeps Bolland waiting at the checkout|publisher=The Times|date=2010-01-28|accessdate=2010-01-28 | location=London | first1=Marcus | last1=Leroux | first2=Ian | last2=King}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At Morrisons annual AGM in June 2014, Morrisons former chairman Sir [[Ken Morrison]] blasted Phillips and his new board of directors for their running of the company Morrison inherited from his father. Morrison's comments were backed up by his nephew Chris Blundell, who controls most of the remaining family stake in the supermarket, also told the board it needed rescuing, and welcomed the decision by chairman Sir Ian Gibson to leave the business next year after months of pressure.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/veteran-morrisons-founder-hits-out-at-the-board-your-strategy-is-a-load-of-bull-9497648.html|title=Sir Ken Blasts Morrisons CEO, Chairman and the board of directors|publisher=The Independent|date=2014-06-06|accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015 it was announced that Philips would be stepping down as CEO.&lt;ref name=dailybusinessgroup&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailybusinessgroup.co.uk/2015/01/poor-sales-put-future-of-morrisons-boss-philips-in-doubt/?|title=Philips pays the price for Morrisons' slump in sales|publisher=dailybusinessgroup|date=2015-01-13|accessdate=2015-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Philips, as well as being chairman of Byron, and of The Ridgeon Group, is currently a Senior Advisor with The [[Boston Consulting Group]], and is a Non-Executive Director of three other boards: industrial plastic group One51 Plc., the UK High Street retailer [[Wilko (retailer)|Wilko]], and the Social Innovation Fund, a provider of growth capital to Irish social enterprises.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7146">The '''Edward Warner Award''' is an award that's given in the field of [[aviation]] to aviation pioneers or organizations that have contributed to [[civil aviation]]. The award is named after [[Edward Pearson Warner|Dr. Edward Pearson Warner]], the first President of the council of [[ICAO]].

The award consists of two items: a medal and a certificate. The medal is made of solid gold and is inscribed with the recipient's name. The certificate is a recognition citing the reasons for the award. The Edward Warner Award is recognized throughout the world as the greatest single honour the international civil aviation community can bestow, for its importance is derived from the fact that it is given by ICAO on behalf of its Member States. No other international civil aviation award offers such wide recognition.

'''Etsko Schuitema''' (born 7 April 1959), is the founder and [[Partnership|Leading Partner]] of Schuitema Associates, a [[business transformation]] consultancy that is based in South Africa and Pakistan. An [[anthropologist]] by training, Etsko developed the Care and Growth Leadership Model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ahmed|first=Adil|title=Developing Human Capital|url=http://archives.dawn.com/weekly/review/archive/051117/review1.htm|newspaper=The Dawn|date=17 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he was employed with the [[South African Chamber of Mines]], which he left in 1989 to research and develop the framework further under Schuitema Associates. He is also a practicing Sufi {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

== Background and education ==

Etsko Schuitema was born to Jurjen and Johanna Schuitema in [[Klerksdorp]], a mining town in the North West province of South Africa. Both his parents were in the mining industry, and as such he had been exposed to the South African mining industry from a young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khan|first=Razia|title=Etsko Schuitema|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008%5C11%5C16%5Cstory_16-11-2008_pg15_2|publisher=Daily Times|accessdate=16 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Etsko's elder brother is Jerry Schuitema, a South African journalist, author and retired management consultant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moneyweb|first=ZA|title=The Human Touch|url=http://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-the-human-touch|work=Moneyweb.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Schuitema completed an [[Honours degree]] in [[Social Anthropology]] from the [[University of Witwatersrand]], South Africa and in 1980 was subsequently employed by the Human Resources Laboratory of the [[South African Chamber of Mines]] as a researcher.&lt;ref name="MacleodGuy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Macleod|first=Guy|title=Cultural considerations : a guide to understanding culture, courtesy and etiquette in South African business|year=2002|publisher=Spearhead|location=Claremont|isbn=0864865317|pages=179, 180|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, he led the research team to perform research on employee discontent.&lt;ref name="MacleodGuy" /&gt;

== Career ==

=== Period ===

The research was done during the peak of [[apartheid]] in South Africa. The [[gold mines]] were South Africa's biggest industry; with its workforce coming from all the ethnic tribes of the region&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Africa's Mining History|url=http://info.goldavenue.com/info_site/in_mine/in_min_sa_his.htm|work=Gold Avenue|publisher=goldavenue.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they reflected the problems that were plaguing South Africa during the apartheid regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byrnes|first=Rita M.|title=ed. South Africa: A Country Study|journal=Ed. South Africa: A Country Study|year=1996|volume=Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress|series=South Africa|issue=Employment and Labor|url=http://countrystudies.us/south-africa/65.htm|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===

The Chamber of Mines Research Organisation commissioned Schuitema and his team to find out what was causing employee conflict in the mines at the organisation.&lt;ref name="Shiva Kumar Thekkepat"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kumar|first=Shiva|title=Etsko Schuitema at work|url=http://gulfnews.com/life-style/people/etsko-schuitema-at-work-1.25684|accessdate=27 January 2012|newspaper=Gulf News|date=24 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey instrument looked at variables that could account for employee discontent and mistrust towards the management.&lt;ref name="MacleodGuy" /&gt;

=== Birth of Care and Growth Model &amp; Schuitema Associates ===

What emerged from the research was that the variables and managerial behaviours that accounted for minimal work conflict, willingness at work, loyalty and trust towards the management were two: '''Care''' and '''Growth'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=KRIEL|first=IGNATIUS GERHARDUS|title=DEVELOPMENTAL LEADERSHIP BEHAVIOUR AND AFFECTIVE COMMITMENT: AN EXPLORATIVE STUDY|date=November 2008|pages=21, 27, 119|url=http://uir.unisa.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10500/2695/thesis_kriel_%20g.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hollander|first=Allen|title=Employee Engagement|url=http://hollanderleadershipblog.wordpress.com/2011/04/22/employee-engagement-2011/|publisher=Hollander Leadership Blog|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that the employees who felt the management was genuinely interested in their welfare as individuals and professionals, trusted their immediate supervisors significantly more than the men who believed the management had no interest in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Illes|first=Katalin|author2=Jim Platts|title=Trust is a Process. A New Direction in Business Education|date=15 October 2006|pages=4–5|url=http://publications.eng.cam.ac.uk/325452/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From his research on conflict and trust in management, Schuitema believes that power only becomes legitimate where the leader benevolently&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Debbie|title=Key elements to becoming a leader|url=http://tlcglobal.wordpress.com/2012/10/05/key-elements-to-becoming-a-leader/|publisher=Training Leadership Consulting|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; exists to provide unconditional care, and fair and honest growth for his/her subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mabili|title=Transactional Leadership vs Transformational Leadership?|url=http://www.mabili.co.za/default.asp?pageid=2863|accessdate=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schuitema Associates was subsequently founded in January 1990 and the Care and Growth Leadership framework was further developed.&lt;ref name="Ramla Akhtar"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramla|first=Akhtar|title=ETSKO SCHUITEMA: INTENT&amp;nbsp;– CARE &amp; GROWTH|url=http://www.tbl.com.pk/etsko-schuitema-intent-care-growth/|work=TBL&amp;nbsp;– Triple Bottom-Line|publisher=TBL&amp;nbsp;– Triple Bottom-Line|accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schuitema promotes the importance of leadership in empowering employees through genuine care and the creation of growth opportunities and empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Mark|title=Lead with Care|url=http://www.graylink.biz/blog/lead-with-care-marklivescom-feature-article/|publisher=Graylink|accessdate=23 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schuitema gives lectures on the Care and Growth material on a regular basis at the [[Institute for Manufacturing]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=Howard|author2=Katalin Illes|title=Promoting and Assessing Integrity in the Research Degree|journal=Electronic Journal of Business Ethics and Organization Studies|year=2008|volume=13|series=2|issue=9|page=58|url=http://ejbo.jyu.fi/pdf/ejbo_vol13_no2_pages_54-60.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Gordon Institute of Business Science]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=GIBS|first=Programme|title=GIBS Programme|url=http://www.gibs.co.za/programmes/corporate-education-executive-programmes/short-courses/values-driven-leadership.aspx|work=Gordon Institute of Business Science|publisher=Gordon Institute of Business Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; in South Africa.

=== Birth of Intent/Personal Excellence Model ===

While teaching the Care and Growth Leadership Model to business leaders and educators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Science &amp; Maths Schools|first=LEAP|title=LEAP 2011 Annual Report|year=2011|page=14|url=http://leapschool.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/LEAP_ANNUAL2011_Final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schuitema discovered that [[Learning organization#Characteristics|personal mastery]] and successful [[leadership]] of others are interlinked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jordan|first=Bay|title=A picture of employee engagement and how to create it|url=http://blog.zealise.com/zealise_blog/2011/12/a-picture-of-employee-engagement-and-how-to-create-it-.html|publisher=Zealise|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I. Herzberg, 76, Professor And Management Consultant" /&gt;   He is most famous for introducing [[job enrichment]] and the [[Motivator-Hygiene theory]].  His 1968 publication "One More Time, How Do You Motivate Employees?" had sold 1.2 million reprints by 1987 and was the most requested article from the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]''.&lt;ref name="Herzberg1987"&gt;{{cite journal |title=One More Time: How Do You Motivate Employees? |journal=Harvard Business Review |first=Frederick |last=Herzberg |volume=65 |issue=5 |date=September–October 1987 |oclc=23349159}} (''note: the reference to sales numbers is in the abstract written by the editors.'')&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|109–120}}

==Personal life==

Herzberg was born in 1923 in [[Lynn, Massachusetts]], to Gertrude and Lewis Herzberg, who were Lithuanian immigrants. He enrolled at the [[City College of New York]] in 1939. He did not finish his studies as he enlisted in the army. In 1944 he married Shirley Bedell.

He finally finished his studies and graduated from the [[City College of New York]] in 1946. He then decided to move to the [[University of Pittsburgh]] where he earned a master's degree in science and public health. He completed a Ph.D. at Pittsburgh focused on electric shock therapy.

==Research==

Herzberg started his research on organizations in the 1950s. He worked at the [[University of Utah]], where he remained until he retired. Prior to his move to Utah, Herzberg was professor of management at Case Western Reserve University, where he established the Department of Industrial Mental Health.

In his lifetime, Herzberg had consulted for many organizations as well as for the United States and other foreign governments. He has a son who currently lives in West New York.&lt;ref name="F. I. Herzberg, 76, Professor And Management Consultant"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/01/business/f-i-herzberg-76-professor-and-management-consultant.html |title=F. I. Herzberg, 76, Professor And Management Consultant |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Barnaby J. |last=Feder |date=February 1, 2000 |accessdate=November 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivator-Hygiene Theory==
{{main|Two-factor theory}}

Herzberg proposed the motivator-hygiene theory, also known as the ''[[two-factor theory]]'' of job satisfaction. According to his theory, people are influenced by two sets of factors.

The idea is that hygiene factors will not motivate, but if they are not there, they can lower motivation. These factors could be anything from clean toilets and comfortable chairs, to a reasonable level of pay and job security. The theory deals with satisfaction and dissatisfaction in jobs which are not affected by the same set of needs, but instead occur independently of each other. Herzberg's theory challenged the assumption that "dissatisfaction was a result of an absence of factors giving rise to satisfaction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Does Herzberg's motivation theory have staying power? |journal=Journal of Management Development |last1=Bassett-Jones |first1=Nigel |last2=Lloyd |first2=Geoffrey C. |volume=24 |issue=10 |pages=929–943 |date=2005 |doi=10.1108/02621710510627064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivational factors will not necessarily lower motivation, but can be responsible for increasing motivation. These factors could involve job recognition, potential for promotion or even the work in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Motivation to Work |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=New York |first1=Frederick |last1=Herzberg |first2=Bernard |last2=Mausner |first3=Barbara B. |last3=Snyderman |edition=2nd |year=1959 |isbn=0-471-37389-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herzberg (1987) describes the growth factors (or ''motivators'') as "achievement, recognition for achievement, the work itself, responsibility, and growth or advancement," which are intrinsic.&lt;ref name="Herzberg1987" /&gt;{{rp|13}} Intrinsic factors include "orientations toward money, recognition, competition, and the dictates of other people, and the latter includes challenge, enjoyment, personal enrichment, interest, and self-determination."&lt;ref name="Stead1972"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Berlo's Communication Process Model as Applied to the Behavioral Theories of Maslow, Herzberg, and McGregor |journal=The Academy of Management Journal |first=Bette Ann |last=Stead |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=389–394 |date=September 1972 |jstor=254868}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hygiene factors (or dissatisfaction-avoidance), which are extrinsic to the job, are "company policy and administration, supervision, interpersonal relationships, working conditions, salary, status, and security".&lt;ref name="Herzberg1987" /&gt;  This extrinsic factor "refers to doing something because it leads to a distinct outcome, something external you expect to receive, and the latter refers to doing something because it is inherently interesting or enjoyable, an internal reward."&lt;ref name="Stead1972" /&gt;

'''The Fuld-Gilad-Herring Academy of Competitive Intelligence''' is an educational organization  bringing professional training to the field of [[competitive intelligence]] (CI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scip.org/Publications/CIMagIssueDetail.cfm?ItemNumber=1988 CI Education Issue]&lt;/ref&gt;  Established in 1996, the Academy has expanded its training to thousands of managers from 58 countries and six continents at its campuses in [[Cambridge, MA]] and [[Brussels, Belgium]]. The Academy is the only CI-dedicated institution to be externally accredited by the [[International Association of Continuing Education and Training]] (IACET).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academyci.com The Academy's web site]&lt;/ref&gt; It grants the Competitive Intelligence Professional (CIP) certification based on a 9-course program, including a course in ethics and a pioneering course in business war gaming.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Hall, “Military moves on the corporate battlefield”, The Evening Standard, 8 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale Buss, “Berlitz for the boss”, Chief Executive, 1 December 2001, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; To be certified, managers must complete the required coursework and pass a certification exam. To accommodate managers whose main interest is in using CI tools and managers working as CI professionals, the Academy offers two levels of certification: a basic CIP-I, and an advanced CIP-II. The Academy is currently the largest training institute in its field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academyci.com/About/alumni.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competitive Intelligence Standards ==

On March, 2011, the board of the professional association in the field of competitive intelligence- '''SCIP''' (Strategic and Competitive Intelligence Professionals) voted to adopt the Academy's CIP program as its official global certification program to help create standards in the field of strategic and competitive intelligence. The certification was renamed SCIP-CIP certificate conferred by ACI.&lt;ref&gt;http://info.intelligencecareers.com/index.php/2011/03/22/2011-06-1324-certification-in-competitive-intelligence-boston-massachusetts/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The history of the Academy tracks closely the history of the field of competitive intelligence which has risen in importance during the 1980s with the increase in global competitive pressures and the spread of [[Internet search engines]] which made information more accessible. In 1986, the [[Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals]] (SCIP) was founded in Washington, DC to serve as the professional association for academics, practitioners and consultants in CI. During the next decade, organizations experimented in acquiring and using CI with little discipline and no consistent results. For example, as a survey by the Academy showed, one of CI's main objectives, avoiding strategic surprises, was not being accomplished in many large companies.&lt;ref&gt;George S. Day and Paul J.H. Schoemaker, “Scanning the Periphery”, ''Harvard Business Review'', November 2005, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Three early developers of the Society banded together to create a standard of training and performance in the field. They were: Leonard Fuld, whose book, ''Competitor Intelligence'', was the first best seller on the subject,&lt;ref&gt;Fuld, Leonard, ''Competitor Intelligence: How to get it, how to use it''. NY: Wiley, 1985.  {{ISBN|978-0471809678}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Gilad|Ben Gilad]], whose book The Business Intelligence System created the benchmark for setting up a corporate CI function,&lt;ref&gt;Gilad, Ben and Tamar Gilad, The Business Intelligence System. NY: American Management Association, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; and Jan Herring who was the founding director of the first competitive intelligence function created in 1982 at [[Motorola]] Corp.&lt;ref&gt;Herring, Jan P. Measuring the Effectiveness of Competitive Intelligence: Assessing &amp; Communicating CI's Value to Your Organization. Virginia: Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the growth of SCIP, the creation of the Academy accelerated greatly the formalization and acceptance of CI functions and positions across global companies, with some estimating that 97% of Fortune 500 corporations today have at least one CI analyst in each of their larger business units.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Boyle, “The Prying Game: A little knowledge is a dangerous...weapon. No wonder competitive intelligence schools are on the rise.” Fortune Magazine, Advisor/Careers, 17 September 2001, Vol. 144, (5), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition==

As the field continued to evolve, several organizations in recent years have joined the Academy in offering training programs in competitive intelligence, mostly as an extension of other degree programs, among them [[Mercyhurst College Institute for Intelligence Studies]] in PA (an extension of a government intelligence program), [[Simmons College (Massachusetts)|Simmons College]] in MA (part of Library and Information studies), and the [[University of Denver]] in CO (part of a graduate degree in information management). Other programs include the [[Ecole de Guerre Economique]] in France and Institute for Competitive Intelligence in Germany. Entry level courses are also offered by the Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals.

==Student body==

The functional distribution of the Academy's alumni body covers managers and professionals from competitive and market intelligence functions, [[marketing]], [[market research]], [[business development]], [[strategic planning]], research scientists and development engineers. Though the typical trainee is a manager at a Global Fortune 500 company, past participants included some unusual representatives from the [[Catholic Church]], various governments' defense agencies, farmer cooperatives, national economic development boards, and a Cabinet Minister.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15035">The analysis of the global environment of a company is called '''global environmental analysis'''. This analysis is part of a company’s analysis-system, which also comprises various other analyses, like the industry analysis, the [[market analysis]] and the analyses of companies, clients and [[competitors]]. This system can be divided into a macro and micro level. Except for the global environmental analysis, all other analyses can be found on the micro level. Though, the global environmental analysis describes the macro environment of a company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dillerup|first=R.|title=Unternehmensführung|year=2006|publisher=Vahlen|location=München|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Obviously, a company is influenced by its environment. Many environmental factors, especially economical or social factors, play a big role in a company’s decisions, because the analysis and the monitoring of those factors reveal chances and risks for the company’s business. This environmental framework also gives information about location issues. A company is thereby able to determine its location sites. Furthermore, many other strategic decisions are based on this analysis. One may also apply the BBW model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kohlöffel|first=K. M.|title=Strategisches Management – Alle Chancen nutzen – Neue Geschäfte erschließen|year=2000|publisher=Carl Hanser Verlag|location=München Wien|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dillerup|first=R.|title=Unternehmensführung|year=2006|publisher=Vahlen|location=München|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the factors are analyzed to evaluate external business developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bleicher|first=K.|title=Das Konzept Integriertes Management – Visionen, Missionen, Programme, 7th edition|year=2004|location=Frankfurt/Main, Campus|page=536}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is finally the task of the management to adapt the firm to its environment or to influence the environment in an adequate way. The latter is mostly the more difficult option. There are different instruments to analyze the company’s environment which are going to be explained afterwards.

==PESTLE analysis==
One instrument to analyse the company’s external environment is the [[PEST analysis]]. PEST stands for political, economical, social and technological factors. Two more factors, the legal and environmental factor, are defined within the PESTLE analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeffs|first=C.|title=Strategic Management|year=2008|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd.|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;   To explain these environmental factors, it is necessary to say that most of the factors depend on each other and that they change over the years. Consequently, when one factor changes it also affects the others. The equality for every company is the main characteristic of the factors in an environmental analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bea, F.X.|first=Haas, J.|title=Strategisches Management, 4th edition|year=2005|publisher=Lucius &amp; Lucius|location=Stuttgart}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The different environmental factors are covered below.

===Political and legal factors===
Political and legal factors are here regarded as a unit. They refer to framework given by politics. The exist regulatory or legal frameworks, which can be binding for regions, nations or on an international basis. The frameworks deal with economical issues or issues concerning the [[Labour economics|labour market]].[[Subsidies]] for instance fall in the category of economical issues. According to the degree of support through subsidies, a country can be more or less attractive for a company. With respect to the [[labour law]] of a country, it can highly influence location decisions, too. If e.g. the dismissal protection in a country is very good, a firm may tend to choose a country with a more flexible hire-and-fire-system. Furthermore, the stability of a political system is a real important aspect for most firms. A [[social market economy]] with rights for co-determination, regulations for patents, the company’s investment and environment protection are main characteristics for a political stable system.

===Economical factors===
Economical factors deal with national or international economical developments and have a direct influence on supplier and consumer markets. Examples of economical factors that play a big role are: the [[GDP]], the [[Inflation rate|rate of inflation]], interests, the change rate, employment or the situation of money markets. These economical factors influence demand, competition intensity, cost pressure and the will to invest. For instance, if the gross domestic product of a country is fairly low, the demand is in general lower than in countries with a higher GDP.

===Social factors===
Social factors deal with social issues regarding the values, ideas, opinions and the culture of market participants. Market participants can be employees, customers or suppliers. Through their contact with the company, they influence it due to their opinions. The company needs to follow the market participant’s change of value and adapt its strategies. Nowadays, a change of values concerning [[environmental protection]] is on the move.

===Technological environmental factors===
Technological environmental factors are meanwhile of a great importance, especially for industrial companies, which underlie a fast technological change. The increasing speed of technological changes, like in microelectronics or robotics indicate risks chances for a company. Particularly producing companies are affected of that fast evolution.

===Environmental factors===
At last, environmental factors are becoming more and more important nowadays. They regard [[natural resources]] and the basis of human life. Among those, the availability of raw materials and energy is the main topic. As the availability of fossil fuels, like oil or coal, gets worse within the next decades, the dependency on those fuels stays pretty risky. Moreover, to show an ecological responsibility, companies should assess and reduce their ecological damage. Through rare raw materials and increasing pollution, an environmentally friendly management gets spotlighted more and more by the public interest. Consequently, [[Sustainable products|eco-friendly products]] or technologies can even signify a competitive advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dillerup|first=R.|title=Unternehmensführung|year=2006|publisher=Vahlen|location=München|pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of the global environmental analysis==
The [[Market segmentation|segmentation]] according to the six presented factors of the PESTLE analysis is the starting point of the global environmental analysis. The analysis can be done with the help of a checklist that evaluates every criteria of a segment. In this manner, the status of the global environment shall be defined. In general, every segment needs to be worked on systematically to recognize changes. Then, the factors and its impacts can be interpreted right. After the segmentation, the analysis consists of four further steps:
# Environmental Scanning
# Environmental Monitoring
# Environmental Forecasting
# Environmental Assessment

===Environmental scanning===

The first step is called scanning. Through [[environmental scanning]], every segment is analyzed to find trend indicators. Thus, after having examined the segment, indicators for its development are defined.&lt;ref name="DR 183"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dillerup|first=R.|title=Unternehmensführung|year=2006|publisher=Vahlen|location=München|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Fahey and Narayanan, scanning reveals ‘actual or imminent change because it explicitly focuses on areas that the organisation may have previously neglected’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mercer|first=D.|title=Marketing strategy: the challenge of external environment|year=1998|publisher=The Open University|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Scanning is also used to detect weak signals in the environment, before these have conflated into a recognizable pattern, which might affect the organization’s competitive environment.

Scanning can include every material published in the media such as television, newspapers and periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mercer|first=D.|title=Marketing strategy: the challenge of external environment|year=1998|publisher=The Open University|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This method of scanning is called media-scanning. Product-scanning includes scanning of products which announce re-emerging consumer behaviour. Looking for global trends on the internet can be defined as online-scanning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neu|first=M.|title=Unternehmensführung, 2nd edition|year=2005|publisher=BWV|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Modes of scanning'''

Four modes of scanning can be distinguished. Francis Joseph Aguilar (1967) differentiates between undirected viewing, conditioned viewing, informal search and formal search.
*'Undirected viewing' means reading a variety of publications for no specific purpose with the possible exception of exploration. This mode is the most cost-efficient one but it also offers the most benefits. There are a lot of varied sources and information which means that the potential data are unlimited. Data are imprecise and vague and there are no guidelines which determine where the search should be focused.
*Applying 'conditioned viewing' the viewer pays attention to the particular kinds of data and assesses their significance for the organization. The field of information is more or less clearly identified.
*'Informal searching' can be defined as actively seeking specific information in a relatively unstructured way.
*The contrast of informal searching is called 'formal searching'. This proactive mode of scanning contains methodologies for obtaining information for specific purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mercer|first=D.|title=Marketing strategy: the challenge of external environment|year=1998|publisher=The Open University|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental monitoring===

Environmental scanning is only one component of global environmental analysis. After having identified critical trends and potential events they have to be monitored. The next step in global environmental analysis is called [[environmental monitoring]]. It can be defined as 'the process of repetitive observing for defined purposes, of one or more elements or indicators of the environment according to pre-arranged schedules in space and time, and using comparable methodologies for environmental sensing and data collection'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Von Agarwal|first=S. K.|title=Environmental monitoring|year=2005|publisher=APH Publishing Corporation|location=Kul Bhushan Nangia|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Through environmental monitoring, data about environmental developments are recorded, followed and interpreted. Out of this, historical development changes that are important for the company can be recognized and evaluated. Additionally, the relevance and the reliability of the data sources are tested. Furthermore, it is checked where prognoses are required.

===Environmental forecasting===

The direction, intensity and speed of environmental trends are explored through environmental [[forecasting]]. Especially the search for possible threats is of importance. 
A [[Prediction|prognosis]] of trends is necessary to get a picture of the future. This is done by adequate methods, like [[strategic foresight]] or [[scenario analysis]].&lt;ref name="DR 183"/&gt;  
Several other methods of forecasting are the following: guessing, [[rule of thumb]], expert judgement, [[extrapolation]], [[Economic indicator|leading indicators]], surveys, [[time-series]] models and econometric systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clements, M. P.|first=Hendry, D. F.|title=A companion to economic forecasting|year=2002|publisher=Blackwell Publishers Ltd.|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 'Guessing' and related methods totally rely on luck. Consequently, it is not generally a useful method. In addition, it is almost impossible to evaluate the uncertainty of a guess in advance.
* 'Expert judgement' lacks validation being the only component of forecasting. It is hardly to predict which ‘oracle’ is successful.
* 'Extrapolation' is effective when tendencies exist. Forecasts are most effective when changes are predicted in tendencies. Prediction in changes in tendencies is likely to miss concerning extrapolative methods.
* 'Forecasting based on leading indicators' needs a stable relationship between the variables that lead and the variables that are led. If the reasons for the lead are not clear the indicators may give misleading information.
* 'Surveys' of businesses can give information about the future. They rely on planning which needs to be realized. Changes in business implicate changes in planning.
* 'Time-series models' are popular forecasting methods. They describe historical patterns of data and they focus on “measurable uncertainty”.
* 'Econometric systems' of equations are the main tool of economic forecasting. They consist of equations which attempt to “model” the behaviour of economic groups such as consumers, producers, workers, investors etc. moderated by historical experience. There are several advantages of using formal econometric systems: Economists are able 'to consolidate existing empirical and theoretical knowledge..., provide a framework for a progressive research strategy..., help to explain their own failures, as well as provide forecasts and policy advice.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clements, M. P.|first=Hendry, D. F.|title=A companion to economic forecasting|year=2002|publisher=Blackwell Publishers Ltd.|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental assessment===

In the last step of the global environmental analysis, the results of the previous three steps (Scanning, Monitoring, Forecasting) are assessed. The discovered environmental trends are reviewed to estimate the probability of their occurrence. Furthermore, they need to be analyzed to evaluate whether they represent a chance or a risk for the company.  The dimension of the chances or risks is also of importance. Moreover, a reaction strategy to the occurring risks or chances needs to be defined. This is done with the help of the Issue-Impact-Matrix, an adequate instrument to evaluate and prioritize trends. The forecasted environmental factors are here classified with respect to their probability of occurrence and their impact on the company. According to their classification, they demonstrate a high, medium or low priority for the company. The factors with a high occurrence probability and a high, significant impact on the company have the highest priority. The higher the priority, the faster need to be reacted to avoid risks and to benefit from chances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dillerup, R.|first=Stoi, R.|title=Unternehmensführung, 3rd edition|year=2011|publisher=Vahlen|location=München|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The environmental assessment represents the last step of the global environmental analysis.

'''Governance in higher education''' is the means by which institutions for [[higher education]] (tertiary or post-secondary education) are formally organized and managed (though often there is a distinction between definitions of [[management]] and [[governance]]). Simply, [[university]] governance is the way in which universities are operated.  Governing structures for higher education are highly differentiated throughout the world, but the different models nonetheless share a common heritage.{{sfn|Altbach|2005|pp=16-18}}{{sfn|Coaldrake et al.|2003|p=5}} Internationally, [[tertiary education]] includes private not-for-profit, private for-profit, and public institutions governed by differentiated structures of management.

Governance and management of post-secondary institutions becomes even more diverse with the differences in defining the relationships between higher and tertiary education (university education), postsecondary education, technical and [[vocational education]], and [[community college]] models of education.  The issues are complicated by current debates over [[collegial]] and shared forms of governance contrasted to [[corporate]] and [[business]] forms of institutional governance.

The concept of [[governance]] in postsecondary education predominantly refers to the internal structure, organization and management of autonomous institutions.  The internal governance organization typically consists of a governing board ([[board of regents]], board of directors), the [[university president]] (executive head, CEO) with a team of administrative [[chancellors]] and staff, faculty senates, academic deans, department chairs, and usually some form of organization for [[student]] representation.  In the United States, state institution governing boards often emphasize the concept of [[citizen]] governance in recognizing that board members serve a [[civic engagement|civic]] role for the institution.  Management structures themselves have become increasingly complex due to the increasing complexity of intraorganizational, interorganizational and governmental relationships.  Whether college and university education, adult education, technical or vocational education, educational administration presents complex challenges at all levels of private and public education.

"Governance" is defined by Kezar and Eckel as the macro-level of policy decision making.{{sfn|Kezar and Eckel|2004|pp=371-398}}  Kezar and Eckel suggest governance is a multi-level concept including several different bodies and processes with different decision-making functions.  In this way, governance is sometimes defined at difference to the internal management of institutions.  Throughout the world, many [[Central government|national]], [[State (administrative division)|state]] and [[Local government|local]] governments have begun to establish coordinating and governing boards as both [[wikt:buffer|buffer]] and bridge to coordinate governance and institutional management.

[[Image:Gkvk.jpg|thumb|left|Administrative building at [[University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore]]]]
Due to the influences of public sector reforms, several authors (Kezar and Eckel 2004; Lapworth 2004; Middlehurst 2004) point out that next to the concept of shared and participative governance a new form of governance has emerged. According to Lapworth, the rise of the notion of corporate governance and the decline of the shared or consensual governance can be seen to be a result of the decline in academic participation, a growing tendency towards [[managerialism]] and the new environment where the universities are operating.{{sfn|Lapworth|2004|pp=299-314}}

University governance varies between countries. McMaster notes the different cultures in universities and the traditional relationships between faculty and administration, characterizing historical transitions and suggesting that universities today are undergoing transitions in culture.{{sfn|McMaster|2007|pp=1-9}}  Kezar and Eckel point out the substance of governance has changed during the last decades with more emphasis put on high stake issues and more incremental decisions made in a less [[collegial]] mode – the reasons for this stem from trends that have devalued the notion of [[participation (decision making)|participation]] and also from the external pressures for more [[accountability]] and demands for quicker decision-making (that sometimes is achieved through [[bureaucracy]]).{{sfn|Kezar and Eckel|2004|pp=371-398}}  McMaster discusses the same changes in university management resulting from the “huge amount of additional administrative work at all levels within the university, and the requirement for a wide range of specialist skills in areas such as marketing, HR management, management accounting, web development and [[instructional design]]” and the difficulties with the tensions that have resulted between collegial and corporate models of management.{{sfn|McMaster|2007|pp=1-9}}

Dearlove emphasises that, under the conditions of mass higher education, no university can avoid the need for some sort of bureaucratic management and organisation, though this does not mean that the importance of informal discipline and profession-based authority (internal governance of universities) can totally be ignored.{{sfn|Dearlove|1997|pp=56-75}}  Lapworth advocates what the author believes is a model of university governance with the positive aspects of corporate and collegial approaches.{{sfn|Lapworth|2004|pp=299-314}}  The issues in university governance discussed by these literatures are detailed by Coaldrake, Stedman, and Little (2003) through a comparative study of current trends in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, with poignant insight into the different models of governance for the management of higher education. Critical of the currents of change toward “corporate governance,” the authors cite reference to literature that calls for “re-balancing” of university governance, maintaining that the re-balancing “would amount to a clarification of shared governance”.{{sfn|Coaldrake et al.|2003|p=14}}  With changing roles in human resources and the external pressures for accountability affecting university relationships internally, McMaster provides insights by defining management styles in terms of nested partnership between faculty and administration, contiguous partnership, and segmented partnership.  With debates over the recent trends, university organizations, governing associations, and numerous postsecondary institutions themselves have set forth policy statements on governance.{{sfn|McMaster|2007|pp=1-9}}

==United States==
Within the US, governance varies greatly from university to university. Without any policy, various statements have been influential. 

===American Association of University Professors===
The [[American Association of University Professors]] (AAUP) was the first organization to formulate a statement on the governance of higher education based on principles of democratic values and participation (which, in this sense, correlates with the [[Yale Report of 1828]], which has been referred to as the “first attempt at a formally stated [[philosophy of education]]” for universities, emphasizing at that time that [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] curricula following the establishment of democratic constitutional governance should not be replaced with retrogression to religious curricula).{{sfn|Brubacher|1982|p=5}} The AAUP published its first "Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities" in 1920, “emphasizing the importance of faculty involvement in personnel decisions, selection of administrators, preparation of the budget, and determination of educational policies.  Refinements to the statement were introduced in subsequent years, culminating in the 1966 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities.{{sfn|AAAUP|1966}}  The document does not provide for a “blueprint” for the governance of higher education. Nor was the purpose of the statement to provide principles for relations with industry and government (though it establishes direction on “the correction of existing weaknesses”).  Rather, it aimed to establish a shared vision for the internal governance of institutions.  Student involvement is not addressed in detail.  The statement concerns general education policy and internal operations with an overview of the formal structures for organization and management.  In process and structure, the meaning with the end result is an organizational philosophy for shared governance in higher education.

===National Education Association===
First published in 1987, the [[National Education Association]] (NEA) statement on faculty governance in higher education is a straightforward point of view on their policy in support of shared governance.  The policy maintains that [[Faculty (university)|faculty]] involvement in governance is critical.  Providing research support, the organization states faculty should advise [[Academic administration|administration]] in developing [[curriculum]] and methods of instruction.  Faculty is responsible for establishing degree requirements, takes primary responsibility in [[tenure]] appointments and the award of promotion and [[sabbatical]].  Addressing issues through [[collective bargaining]], the statement believes “administration and the governing boards of colleges and universities should accept the faculty's recommendations”.{{sfn|NEA|1987}}  The statement also maintains that faculty should be involved in salary decisions, evaluating administrators, and budgeting.  The policy concludes with the assertion:
&lt;blockquote&gt; State and federal government and external agencies should refrain from intervening in the internal governance of institutions of higher education when they are functioning in accordance with state and federal law. Government should recognize that conserving the autonomy of these institutions is essential to protecting academic freedom, the advance of knowledge, and the pursuit of truth.{{sfn|NEA|1987}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The policy statement references the AAUP's "1966 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities."  The basic principles evidently draw from the early AAUP statement on governance.  Though the NEA makes no mention of students anywhere in the policy, the NEA like the AAUP does reflect the basic ideas and premise for the “responsibility primarily of the faculty to determine the appropriate curriculum and procedures of student instruction”.{{sfn|AAUP|1966}}  In this respect, the AAUP grants that considerations should be made for publicly supported institutions.  Unlike the NEA, the AAUP elaborates more on the role of governing structures, including the role of the president to ensure "sound academic practices", as the NEA suggests faculty rights to appeal flawed and improper procedures. In summation, where the AAUP discusses the [[organizational structure]] for governance and management in more detail while touching on student involvement, the NEA statement differs by detailing primarily faculty rights and responsibilities in shared governance.

===Statement of community college governance===
Following on the 1987 publication of "Policy Statement on Higher Education Faculty Governance", in 1989 the NEA issued a "Policy Statement on Higher Education Policy for Community College Governance."  The NEA elaborates upon issues in support of shared governance for the management of community colleges, junior and technical colleges not addressed in their previous statement.  The statement is based on the same principles, believing cooperative decision-making and collective bargaining in governance should be based on “collegial” relationships.  Where statements from the NEA and the AAUP advocate the importance of faculty involvement in governance, the [[community college]] statement notes that many do not exercise the right when available and that faculty “at public institutions are not yet permitted to bargain collectively in many states”.{{sfn|NEA|1989}}  The NEA then elaborates upon the need for faculty participation.

Again, the "Policy Statement of Community College Governance" correlates based upon the same underlying principles of the AAUP and NEA statement on faculty governance.  The community college statement also elaborates upon structure and procedure not addressed in the previous statement, including the “ad hoc” and standing committees as discussed in the AAUP policy statement on governance.  Where the AAUP statement discusses policy on students and their academic rights, with the community college statement the NEA does not address student involvement.{{sfn|NEA|1989}}

===American Federation of Teachers===
In 2002, the Higher Education Program and Policy Council of the [[American Federation of Teachers]] (AFT) published a statement in support of the shared governance of institutions.  The policy statement is a response to the fact that many governing boards have adopted the "mantra of business”.{{sfn|AFT|2002}}  The AFT iterates the purpose by which higher education achieves democratic organizational processes between administration and faculty, believing shared governance is under attack in six ways:{{sfn|AFT|2002|p=5}}
# the outsourcing of instruction, particularly to learning technologies;
# redirecting teaching to part-time and temporary faculty;
# re-orienting curriculum to business oriented coursework;
# the buying and selling of courseware for commercial exploitation;
# for profit teaching and research;
# with the formation of a “commercial consortia with other universities and private investors."  Meaning, as many have begun to view education as business, they are not necessarily in the business of education.

Accordingly, six principles affirm standards of [[academic freedom]], faculty participation in standards and curriculum, and faculty decisions on academic personnel as the AAUP first established principles of governance.  The statement maintains that participation in shared governance should be extended, acknowledging that the way in which participation is expanded will vary from institution to institution; “but each group whose work contributes to the academic enterprise should be involved in a manner appropriate to institutional functions and responsibility”.{{sfn|AFT|2002|p=8}}  The policy addresses unions and faculty senates, believing that they contribute to the maintenance of shared governance in institutions as well as the role of accrediting agencies to support management standards.  In conclusion, the AFT emphasizes affirmation of the goals, objectives and purpose for shared governance in higher education.

===Association of Governing Boards===
With recent debates and trends in the governance of institutions of higher education in the United States, the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges (AGB) issued a statement on governance, most recently updated in 2010.  The original statement was published with a correlating statement, “Governing in the Public Trust:  External Influences on Colleges and Universities.”  In the first statement on governance, the advisiory organization for institutional governance discusses facts and perceptions concerning governance, including specific facts related to institutional trends and perceptions that “internal governance arrangements have become so cumbersome that timely decisions are difficult to make”.{{sfn|AGB|2001|p=3}}  The AGB statement then defines general principles upon which governing boards are to operate and the responsibilities of a governing board to the institution; the updated principles as of 2010 are below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=AGB |title=Statement on Board Responsibility for Institutional Governance |url=http://agb.org/news/2010-03/statement-board-responsibility-institutional-governance |publisher=AGB|accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The ultimate responsibility for governance of the institution (or system) rests in its governing board.
# The board should establish effective ways to govern while respecting the culture of decision making in the academy.
# The board should approve a budget and establish guidelines for resource allocation using a process that reflects strategic priorities.
# Boards should ensure open communication with campus constituencies.
# The governing board should manifest a commitment to accountability and transparency and should exemplify the behavior it expects of other participants in the governance process.
# Governing boards have the ultimate responsibility to appoint and assess the performance of the president.
# System governing boards should clarify the authority and responsibilities of the system head, campus heads, and any institutional quasi-governing or advisory boards.
# Boards of both public and independent colleges and universities should play an important role in relating their institutions to the communities they serve.

With their statement on governing bodies, the AGB then provides statement on governing in the [[public trust]], iterating many of the same points concerning recent external pressures.  The statement defines the historic role and rationale behind the principles of [[citizen]] governance upon which state institutional boards operate.  Again, addressing the nature of external influences in university governance, the AGB defines specific principles in maintaining accountability and autonomy in the public trust, including
# the primacy of the board over individual members;
# the importance of institutional [[mission statement|mission]]s;
# respecting the board as both [[wikt:buffer|buffer]] and bridge;
# exhibiting exemplary public behaviour; and
# keeping [[academic freedom]] central.{{sfn|AGB|2001|pp=23-26}}

In conclusion, the statement asks for the reaffirmation of a commitment to citizen governance to maintain the balanced and independent governance of institutions.

===2001 Kaplan Survey on higher education governance===
[[Image:Mizzou MemorialUnion.jpg|thumb|right|Tower of Memorial Union at [[University of Missouri]]]]

Sponsored by the AAUP and the American Conference of Academic Deans, the 2001 Survey of Higher Education Governance is a study done by Gabriel Kaplan, a doctoral student at Harvard University interested in replicating research done by Committee T of the AAUP thirty years previously.  The findings of the report detail the method with summary of the present state of shared governance. The findings include the state of the locus of authority and reforms as well as the analysis of the challenges facing Liberal Arts Colleges with the pressures of the current economic climate.{{sfn|Kaplan|2001}}  The preliminary results contain the raw data on the landscape of governance in higher education from a population of 1303 4-year institutions in the United States, with data compiled from both administrative structures and the faculty.  The survey did not include participation from any population of students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaup.org/NR/rdonlyres/449D4003-EB51-4B8D-9829-0427751FEFE4/0/01Results.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shared governance and Jesuit Catholic universities===
[[File:Dartmouth Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Dartmouth College]], 1834]]
Since the 1819 U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[Dartmouth College v. Woodward]]'' before the [[Yale Report of 1828]] (where the former was catalyst from the later, each of which upheld the [[separation of church and state]]) private universities in the United States generally maintain remarkable autonomy from local, state, and federal government.  Questions might be raised over the role of shared governance in [[private education]].  In ''Conversations on Jesuit Higher Education'', Quinn and Moore (2005) support values of shared governance in Jesuit Universities.  Quinn notes the way in which [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] colleges and universities adopted principles of shared governance throughout the 1960s.{{sfn|Quinn|2005|pp=30-31}}  Moore begins by noting that the concept of shared governance is often viewed as inefficient in the [[corporate]] world.{{sfn|Moore|2005|pp=26-28}} The author believes that shared governance is not a cumbersome [[system]] of [[management]], but necessary given the organizational dynamics and complexities of university systems.

By contrast to corporate trends, the author maintains that the corporate “one-size-fits-all” system could not effectively suit institutional needs.  From which, the perspective then affirms the AAUP tradition of shared governance as a sound system of organization and management in higher education, “essential to the long term interests of colleges and universities if they wish to remain competitive and academically credible”.{{sfn|Moore|2005|pp=26-28}}  The way in which shared governance is realized in Catholic colleges and universities does vary from institution to institution.  In [[Jesuit]] institutions, when serving the role of a board member an individual of the formal order provides guidance on the philosophy of Jesuit education while facilitating “the mutuality so essential for shared governance before the law and in reality,”{{sfn|Quinn|2005|pp=30-31}} respecting Catholic traditions with a democratic spirit of institutional governance.

==Australia==
In October 2003, the [[Australian Vice-Chancellors’ Committee]] (AVCC), the council of [[Australia]]’s university presidents, put forward a “Chancellors and AVCC statement on university governance."  Given national and institutional debates over the governance of tertiary education, the statement acknowledges the opportunities with developments in management and governing structures.  The statement notes the role of the “business model” that has been advanced alongside the traditional models of governance in Australia.  With reference to additional “third models” in introducing a discussion of the existing frameworks for the governance of tertiary education, the statement defines the legal autonomy of institutions and independence from external [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]].  Acknowledging the diversity of governing structures and believing a balance is necessary between internal and external forces, the organization maintains:  “No single way to achieve an effective governance arrangement” is possible.{{sfn|AVCC|2003|p=3}}  In recognizing the differences in institutional structures and frames of reference, the statement offers operational good practices as generic principles and recommendations, also identifying national protocols for the success of Australian higher education.

The recommendations address practices by which internal governing structures operate and how they can improve institutional governance for the Commonwealth of Australia.  External relations, the role of faculty and students in governance are not approached except inasmuch as institutional board members should be appointed with their selection based on contributions “to the effective working of the governing body by having needed skills, knowledge and experience, an appreciation of the values of a university and its core activities of teaching and research, its independence and academic freedom and the capacity to appreciate the university’s external community needs from that university”.{{sfn|AVCC|2003|p=6}}  The committee defines the [[Moral responsibility|responsibilities]] of university governance, including legal obligations and legislative requirements for the internal governing boards of Australian institutions.  Accordingly, governing bodies “should make available a programme of induction and professional development . . . to ensure that all members are aware of the nature of their duties and responsibilities”.{{sfn|AVCC|2003|p=6}}  The report concludes with protocol for annual reports, including report of risk management and additional steps to ensure [[good governance]].

==Africa==
The Pan-African Institute of University Governance is a project set up by the Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie and by the Association of Commonwealth universities, in support of the Ministry of the higher education of Cameroon. It was launched during the World Conference on the Higher education of the UNESCO which was held in Paris from 5 to 8 July 2009, by the Rector of the AUF, Mr Bernard Cerquiglini, and the General Secretary of the ACU Mr John Tarrant.

Based physically at the Yaounde - Cameroon, it is about a unique structure of support which aims at improving all the practices which contribute to the smooth running of higher education in Africa. Its vocation is to accompany the modernization of the governance of higher education thanks to the implementation of expertise, the modules of training, seminars and workshops and especially specific tools of management, analysis and evaluation. It spreads his actions on the whole domain of governance (academic, administrative, financial, social, numerical and of the research) and has a function of observatory of higher education in Africa.

At this effect, the Institute founds its methods of work on its role of observatory of higher education, on its expertise in evaluation of mechanisms of functioning and decision-making in establishments, and thus on its capacity of analysis of the modes and tools of management of higher education.

The Institute’s action is founded around five major challenges:
*a challenge of efficiency to develop the universities’ practices of governance and make them real actors of the development. 
*a technical challenge to help universities rationalize their means and realize in best their missions
*a strategic challenge by the pooling of tools and the exchange of the good practices
*an African challenge to realize an African community of higher education which transcends the language and political barriers
*a political challenge through its network of partners and experts.

The activities of the Institute in 2009–2010 are articulate around three types of actions:
*the effective launch of the Institute
*the knowledge of the mechanisms of university governance through two inquiries
*initiatives of training, information and promotion.

The Institute works in partnership with stakeholders and international institutions to accompany initiatives and realize actions which can contribute to the improvement of the functioning of higher education and more widely education in Africa.

The philosophy of this Institute expands dialogue and shared experience between African university leaders on issues related to university governance. Methods will step out from the classical models of cooperation in which the "expertise" of the North are transmitted to “addressee” and “consignee” of the South, leading to the principals and attitudes of copy-write. African Universities can only develop if they succeed in inventing their own policies and procedures, all by taking into consideration international standards.

To assist universities in the accomplishment of their missions in an efficient and modern way, the Pan-African Institute of University Governance shall make use of the relationship it has with partners such as the Agence universitaire de la Francophonie (AUF) and the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU).

The AUF-ACU partnership consists of two joined visions. Rounding on common objectives and shared missions, Anglophones, Francophones, Lusophones and Arabic-speakers will better enrich discussions on how to develop higher educational system. This illustrates the importance taken by cultural diversity in the World today, being an essential basis for development inside more harmonized globalization which takes into account each person’s identity and values. Therefore, our approach is that of the exchange of experience and good practices likely to be widespread within the framework of our institutions that most frequently lack real communication.

About governance : Two approaches shall enable us to tackle the problems of higher education institutions’ governance in Africa. The first one is current. It consists of rationalizing, valorizing and modernizing both the university foundations and their various systems of functioning. It supposes to put on better the whole university structure : better management, transparency in the decision-making and the participation of all actors in the decision-making. The second approach of governance fundamentally questions the efficiency of the systems of functioning of universities, too much centered on the hierarchical authority of the State, and on that of the university and academic administration, whether it is to define the financing, programs, the qualifications and even the courses of training. The governance of higher education will succeed only if it allows creating a common space of meeting between the actors : political, socioeconomic, students, teaching and civil society.

==South Africa==
[[File:UCT Jammie steps.jpg|thumb|Jameson Hall at the [[University of Cape Town]]]]
[[South Africa]] faces issues related to the governance of their tertiary system of higher education that correlate with international trends.  Hall and Symes (2005) discuss the state of South African higher education in the first decade of the country’s [[constitutional democracy]] at a time when the country has faced not only democratic transition but also the end of Apartheid racial segregation.  With the South African transition to democracy in 1994, the national government and institutions of postsecondary learning envisioned the [[cooperative]] governance of higher education.  For a developing country that faced “massive social exclusion” for the better part of a century – only to be challenged in the 1970s and 1980s –  traditional models for governance in higher education, European and North American models of institutional autonomy are not entirely applicable to the South African context.{{sfn|Hall and Symes|2005|pp=205-206}}  The authors discuss the need for government “steering,” an idea originally envisioned in South Africa with the democratic transition, based upon a cooperative framework as a “conditional autonomy.”  The goals and objectives for cooperative governance were thus established with the National Commission on Higher Education (NCHE) in 1994, detailed in its 1996 report.

The South African National Commission on Higher Education was meant to serve as a “[[Buffer solution|buffer]] mechanism” between government and institutions to establish a [[system]] by which “autonomous higher education institutions would work in a range of partnerships with government and other stakeholders,” from the involvement of state supervision and consultation.{{sfn|Hall and Symes|2005|pp=200,204,210}}   Within the initial years of the democratic transition and the end of the [[Apartheid]], Hall and Symes (2005) note that the national government assumed a much stronger [[regulatory]] and [[bureaucratic]] control of South African postsecondary institutions than what had been originally expected.  From the appointments to the National Commission on Higher Education, the 1997 Higher Education Act, and the 2001 National Plan for Higher Education, the national government has assumed direct command of [[curriculum]], funding and regulation over institutions with “weak or non-existent traditions of academic freedom”.{{sfn|Hall and Symes|2005|pp=201-202}}

Where the 1997 Higher Education Act and [[minister (government)|ministerial]] appointments provided the framework by which the national government could assert control over postsecondary institutions, the 2001 Education Amendment Act and [[white paper]] expressed the government’s motivations to take a strong position of power in the governance of South African higher education.  Whereby, the “period from the 1997 White Paper to the 2001 National Plan for Higher Education has seen a systematic tightening of state control and the [[erosion]] of both the procedural and substantive autonomy of individual institutions”.{{sfn|Hall and Symes|2005|p=210}}   Furthermore, Hall and Symes note that while the ten universities reserved for white students during the apartheid maintained substantial autonomy, other institutions such as [[technical schools]] and “branches of the racially defined government bureaucracy,” continued to be governed by tight government intervention.{{sfn|Hall and Symes|2005|pp=201-202}}   The authors do not reject the need for government “steering,” and cooperative governance with the national government for the [[developing country]].  Nonetheless, where the concept of conditional [[autonomy]] remained vague with its vision in 1996, the authors suggest that given the direction the government and NCHE have taken, there need be a rethinking of the relationship between institutions and the newly established democratic government.

==Other European countries==
Institutions of tertiary higher education in Europe have been under reform, following the common goals and objectives to develop new models for institutional governance.  Sporn, writing for [[EDUCAUSE]], discusses the restructuring of higher education with “notions of new public management", which the author correlates to neoliberal economic models.{{sfn|Sporn|2003|p=31}}  The author directly relates these currents in the management of European [[higher education]] with the influence of U.S. models for approaching change in higher education. The European countries of [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] are provided as additional examples of the new managerialism in tertiary education.{{sfn|Sporn|2003|p=33}}  In both Norway and Sweden, each have emphasized restructuring based on in vogue [[international]] trends with different approaches to reform that are characterized as common to continental Europe.  New organizational forms for governance and [[leadership]] with the diversification of higher education have emphasized maintaining institutional [[autonomy]], harmonizing institutional standards, and expanding higher education with goals related to the neoliberal market model of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Higher Degree Research By Numbers: Beyond the Critiques of Neo-liberalism| first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Liam | last2= Grealy | journal=Higher Education Research &amp; Development  | volume= 36 | issue= 3 | pages= 458–471 | year= 2017 | url=https://www.academia.edu/31833744/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stressing quality of learning and leadership within higher education, restructuring by way of the key catchphrases such as accountability, changing management in Europe also includes providing for human resource goals such as [[staff development]].

Significant among these changes is the establishment of governing and coordinating boards with [[decision-making]] structures for collaboration in external and internal governance of higher education (as done in many states within the United States).  Believing that there will be either a [[wikt:convergence|convergence]] or [[divergence]] between a strong administrative managerialism and faculty involvement in governance throughout Europe, the UK and U.S., the example of the system in [[Austria]] illustrates the potential for innovative approaches that grant autonomy to institutions with restructuring through an external board.  In conclusion, Sporn believes the new governing structures provide stronger leadership and management, but that institutions "should pay close attention to the role of faculty and shared governance."{{sfn|Sporn|2003|p=41}}

==United Kingdom==

Changes in the [[United Kingdom]]’s system of higher education are given as examples of [[neoliberal]] economic models.  Increased managerialism with economic privatization and minimizing internal governing structures are common themes in the restructuring of UK higher education, which entails the “erosion of the power of unions and professionals and the increased importance of managers and nonexecutive, nonelected directors.{{sfn|Sporn|2003|p=32}}  In general, the new [[managerialism]] in Europe involves four different trends:

* [[Economic efficiency|Efficiency]] in finances with stronger managerial controls and deregulation of the [[Labour (economics)|labor]] market, i.e. ''the Efficiency Drive''.
* [[Layoff|Downsizing]] and [[Decentralization]], breaking up large institutions into smaller peripherary units with a small centralized managerial core and a split between public and private funding.
* [[Excellence]], the ''In Search For Excellence Model'', which focuses on a more [[Human resources|human resource]] approach to institutional change with a mix of top-down and bottom-up organization
* [[public services|Public Service]], with the merging of both public and private managerial practices.

'''Heinrich Bütefisch''' (24 February 1894, [[Hanover]]{{spaced ndash}}5 September 1969, [[Essen]]) was a [[German people|German]] chemist, manager at [[IG Farben]], and [[Nazi war criminal]].&lt;ref name="Auschwitz"&gt;{{cite book |title=Auschwitz |last1=Dwork |first1=Deborah |first2=Robert Jan |last2=Pelt |year=2002 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location= |isbn=0-393-32291-2 |page=207 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DX9ga-jWBtEC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an  [[Obersturmbannführer]] in the [[SS]].

==World War II==
As a leading figure in [[IG Farben]], Bütefisch joined the ''[[Freundeskreis der Wirtschaft|Freunde des Reichsführer-SS]]'', an exclusive group close to [[Heinrich Himmler]] whose membership allowed prominent individuals in German society to become effectively [[SS]] officers without undergoing rigorous selection or training.&lt;ref&gt;G.S. Graber, ''History of the SS'', Diamond Books, 1994, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; He served as one of [[Nazi Germany]]'s ''Wehrwirtschaftsführer'' (war economy leaders) and received the [[Knight's Cross of the War Merit Cross]].&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;spiegel.de 8. April 1964: [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46174338.html Soll und Haben]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monowitz==
During the [[IG Farben trial]], Bütefisch was convicted in 1948 as a [[war criminal]]&lt;ref name="Auschwitz" /&gt; and sentenced to six years in prison. He was head of production at the Bunawerke facility at [[Monowitz]], part of the [[Auschwitz]] complex of camps. The extensive works were to have produced [[Buna rubber]], or [[polybutadiene]] for use in rubber tyres. Monowitz was built as an Arbeitslager (workcamp); it also contained an "Arbeitsausbildungslager" (Labor Education Camp) for non-Jewish prisoners perceived not up to par with German work standards. It held approximately 12,000 prisoners, the great majority of whom were Jewish, in addition to non-Jewish criminals and political prisoners. Prisoners from Monowitz were leased out by the SS to IG Farben to labor at the [[Monowitz Buna Werke|Buna Werke]], a collection of chemical factories including those used to manufacture Buna (synthetic rubber) and synthetic oil. The SS charged IG Farben three Reichsmarks (RM) per day for unskilled workers, four (RM) per hour for skilled workers, and one and one-half (RM) for children. By 1942 the new labour camp complex for IG Farben prisoners occupied about half of its projected area, the expansion was for the most part finished in the summer of 1943. The last 4 barracks were built a year later. The labor camp's population grew from 3,500 in December 1942 to over 6,000 by the first half of 1943. By July 1944 the prisoner population was over 11,000, most of whom were Jews. Despite the growing death-rate from slave labor, starvation, executions or other forms of murder, the demand for labor was growing, and more prisoners were brought in. Because the factory management insisted on removing sick and exhausted prisoners from Monowitz, people incapable of continuing their work were murdered. The company argued that they had not spent large amounts of money building barracks for prisoners unfit to work.

==Work conditions==
On 10 February 1943 [[SS-Obersturmbannführer]] Gerhard Maurer, responsible for employment of concentration camp prisoners went to [[Oświęcim]]; he promised IG Farben the arrival of another thousand prisoners, in exchange for the incapable factory workers. More than 10,000 prisoners were victims of the selection during the period in which the camp operated. Taken to the main camp's hospital, most victims were killed by a lethal injection of [[phenol]] to the heart. Some were sent to Birkenau where they were liquidated after "re-selection" in the Bllf prison hospital or in most cases murdered in the gas chambers. More than 1,600 other prisoners died in the hospital at Monowitz, and many were shot at the construction site or hanged at the camp. Summing up all figures, an estimated total number of about 10,000 Auschwitz concentration camp prisoners lost their lives because of working for IG Farben.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2007-0058, IG-Farbenwerke Auschwitz.jpg|thumb|320px|[[IG Farben]] plant under construction approximately {{convert|10|km}} from [[Auschwitz]], 1942]]
[[Primo Levi]], author of [[If This Is a Man]] survived Monowitz, and [[Elie Wiesel]], author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book "Night", was a teenage inmate at Monowitz along with his father. The life expectancy of Jewish workers at Buna Werke was three to four months; for those working in the outlying mines, only one month. Those deemed unfit for work were gassed at [[Birkenau]], phrased as sent "to Birkenau" (nach Birkenau), according to a euphemism used in I.G. Farben record books. The chemical works relied on thousands of the [[concentration camp]] inmates for [[forced labour]] during construction. The poor conditions in which they were held and to which they were subjected while working ensured a high death rate. 
Bütefisch was also head of operations at [[Leuna works]], a very large producer of synthetic fuel.

==Indictment and trial==
He was indicted at the Nuremberg [[IG Farben trial]], convicted and sentenced to 6 years including time already served. The  reasons for the judgment contain the statement 'Die Ausbeutung der Arbeit von KZ-Insassen ist ein Verbrechen gegen die Menschlichkeit.' (the exploitation of concentration camp inmates is a crime against humanity).&lt;ref name="spiegel" /&gt;

He served his sentence in [[Landsberg Prison]] and was released in 1951.

==Later life==
In 1952, Bütefisch became a member of the supervisory boards for [[Deutsche Gasolin AG]], [[Feldmühle]], and [[Papier- und Zellstoffwerke AG]]. He also became a consultant for [[Ruhrchemie AG Oberhausen]], joining its supervisory board in 1952.

In 1964, he was awarded the [[Grand Cross of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]] (''Großes Verdienstkreuz''). Protests ensued, so much so that President [[Heinrich Lübke]] asked him to return the award.

Bütefisch died on 5 September 1969 in [[Essen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wollheim-memorial.de/en/heinrich_buetefisch_18941969 |title=Wollheim Memorial |work=wollheim-memorial.de |year=2011 |accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Claude Decaux]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/profile/jean-claude-decaux/&lt;/ref&gt; (b. in 1937) first created a company in 1955 that specialised in [[Out-of-home advertising|Outdoor advertising]] alongside motorways. However, as these billboards were heavily taxed by law, Jean-Claude Decaux turned towards a business model in 1964 which was based on city billboards and invented the concept of advertising street furniture - well-maintained bus shelters fully funded by advertisers.

Since the first concept of the bus shelter in 1964, JCDecaux has continued to innovate and offer different types of street furniture. During the 70s, JCDecaux launched its first Citylight Information Panels (CIPs), a 2m² billboard with signage to indicate directions in cities to drivers. The first fully accessible automatic amenities were installed in San Francisco in 1994, although, in 1981, JCDecaux established a system of automatic public amenities in France. In 1981, JCDecaux also developed the ''News Electronic Journal'', which broadcast news relating to culture, sport, associations and information about the city.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

JCDecaux then bought the ''Société Fermière des Colonnes Morris''. The Senior billboards, which measure 8m² and allow multiple ads on a single site, were created in the 1980s. The first scrolling billboards appeared in 1988, which increased the number of advertising panels without raising the number of structures.

In 1999, the group acquired Havas Media Communication and Avenir.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/47997/&lt;/ref&gt; This acquisition allowed the Group to expand into the large format advertising market and into advertising in airports. In 2001, JCDecaux entered the Euronext Stock Exchange&lt;ref&gt;http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2001-09-19/news-in-brief-jc-decaux-enters-euronext-index?ea9c8a2de0ee111045601ab04d673622&lt;/ref&gt; with an opening share price of €16,50. In 2002, Jean-Claude Decaux passed the management of the company on to two of his three sons, Jean-Charles Decaux and [[Jean-François Decaux]], who then became co-[[CEO]]s of the company.

JCDecaux installed its first rental system of self-service bicycles in Vienna in 2003 and then in Lyon in 2005. In 2007, JCDecaux won a tender for Paris’ street furniture and bicycle rental system. Today,{{when|date=March 2017}} JCDecaux is ranked the number one company worldwide in self-service bicycles, with a fleet of 52,000 bicycles now present in 70 cities. JCDecaux operates this service under the brand ''Cyclocity''.

In 2011, JCDecaux acquired ''MediaKiosk'' (a company which own kiosks in France) as the main shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/24/idUS178677+24-Oct-2011+BW20111024{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the open data movement, JCDecaux made available its data system of the rental bike service in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://developer.jcdecaux.com/#/home&lt;/ref&gt; The company is also recognized for its commitment to sustainable development and holds an [[ISO 14001]] certification.

== Activities ==

The JCDecaux Group specialises in advertising street furniture, large format billboards, advertising on public transport, and self-service bicycle rental systems.

=== Street furniture ===

Advertising street furniture was a concept invented by Jean-Claude Decaux.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Street furniture includes bus shelters, [[Advertising column|Morris Columns]], City Information Panels (CIP/MUPIs) and kiosks. Such formats enable advertisers to reach city centres, where large format billboards are not available. Cities can retain a portion of the advertising panels for their own use.

In some countries, JCDecaux holds a contract in shopping malls.

In order to adapt street furniture to the environment, JCDecaux works with internationally renowned designers, such as: [[Mario Bellini]], [[Philip Cox]], [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Norman Foster]], [[Patrick Jouin]], [[Philippe Starck]], [[Robert A. M. Stern|Robert Stern]], [[Martin Szekely]] and [[Jean-Michel Wilmotte]]. JCDecaux also has a Design Office, which works to improve and modernise furniture.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Street furniture also includes a range of non-advertising sites, such as self-service toilets, electronic newspapers and interactive kiosks next to public benches, bins, columns, road signs, glass batteries and paper containers.

=== Transport advertising ===

The term transport includes [[Outdoor advertising]] in airports, on the underground, on buses, trams, and on taxis. JCDecaux operates concessions in 150 airports and over 300 subways, trains, trolleys and bus stations.
In 2013, advertising in Transport accounted for 37.9% of JCDecaux's revenue.&lt;ref name="jcdecaux.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jcdecaux.com/en/The-JCDecaux-group/Annual-Report |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004031930/http://www.jcdecaux.com/en/The-JCDecaux-group/Annual-Report |archivedate=2016-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Billboard advertising ===

Billboard advertising includes advertising billboards of more than 8m². These formats can be adapted for many different purposes, such as for event artworks (for example: building wraps), which is operated by JCDecaux under the brand ''Artvertising''.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Individuals are offered the opportunity to lease part of their property (i.e. wall or garden) to JCDecaux as a billboard site.

==Bicycle rental systems==
[[File:Vélib Sèvres-Lecourbe.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Vélib' bicycle hire station at [[Sèvres – Lecourbe (Paris Métro)]].]]
[[File:Fiat Doblo JC Decaux Strasbourg.JPG|thumb|upright|JCDecaux van in France.]]
The [[Bicycle sharing system|public bicycle rental systems]] are each financed by local advertising operators, in most cases in return for the cities signing over a 10-year licence to exploit citywide billboards. The overall scheme is called ''Cyclocity'' by the company, but each city's system is branded under an individual name.

The cities that have implemented its bicycle rental systems are listed below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.cyclocity.com/Cities/Cyclocity-in-the-world/Cyclocity-cities |title=Cyclocity cities |date=2013-07-09 |accessdate=2014-05-04| website=Cyclocity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4621">'''Justo Daract''' (1804–1887) was an Argentine politician who served as governor of [[San Luis Province]] and in the [[Argentine Senate]] and [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]], representing that province.

==Life and times==
Son of a [[French Argentine]] immigrant, Daract was born in [[San Luis, Argentina]], studied in [[Buenos Aires]], and became a retailer. The alliance in 1840 of [[Córdoba Province (Argentina)|Córdoba]] and five smaller, northwestern provinces in a [[Argentine Civil Wars|Northern Coalition]] against [[Buenos Aires Province]] Governor [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] (the paramount figure in the [[Argentine Confederation]]) prompted Daract to join the [[Unitarian Party]]. Following the coalition's defeat in November, however, Daract fled to [[Chile]], and reopened his former Buenos Aires business there. He received financial support from the governor of [[San Luis Province]], [[Pablo Lucero]], and stockpiled arms for an eventual return.

He returned to Argentina in 1850, and purchased a [[cattle ranch]] in San Luis Province, becoming an important supplier for the Army. He was named [[Civil Court]] magistrate in 1853, though by then, he had distanced himself from Governor Lucero, and led an alliance of both Unitarians and their enemies, the [[Federales (Argentina)|Federalists]], against the governor. The alliance succeeded in persuading Lucero to step down, and on November 8, 1854, Daract was selected governor by an assembly. He enacted a new provincial constitution, and promptly called for elections. Daract won in the polls later that year, and became the first elected governor of San Luis. 

The governor enacted numerous reforms during his tenure. He established a [[judicial system]], subdivided the province into eight departments, established a system of [[public land]] [[lease]]s over vast tracts of provincially owned [[pasture]]s, founded the first newspaper in San Luis, regulated native American commerce, founded a strategically located [[fort]] (at what today is [[Villa Mercedes, San Luis|Villa Mercedes]]), and had a variety of infrastructure built in the pastoral province, as well as commissioning what became the Cathedral of San Luis (notable for its [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] portico). Serving out his term, he stepped down in 1859, and was succeeded by General [[Juan Esteban Pedernera]].

A series of disorders caused by the Federalist defeat at the [[Battle of Pavón]] led to Daract's re-appointment as governor by an assembly and with the support of Buenos Aires, in December 1861. Serving for five months, he mediated a truce between Unitarian general [[Wenceslao Paunero]] and [[La Rioja Province (Argentina)|La Rioja Province]] governor [[Chacho Peñaloza]], who had invaded San Luis Province amid a renewed conflict with Unitarians; the truce resulted in the Treaty of La Banderita, which contributed to national stability by dissipating conflict in the [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]] (western) region of Argentina.

Daract was elected to the [[Argentine Senate]] in 1863. He advocated for provincial [[autonomy]] and negotiated a truce between the national government and the [[Ranquel]] people that inhabited the San Luis area. He was elected to the Provincial Legislature, and in April 1865, to a third term as governor. A Federalist uprising in November 1866 forced Daract and his government to evacuate San Luis. Argentine Army troops, led by General [[José Miguel Arredondo]], retook San Luis in the April, 1867, Battle of San Ignacio, however, and Daract regained his post.

The intervention made Daract a staunch supporter of the President, [[Bartolomé Mitre]], and he was elected to the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Lower House of Congress]] on Mitre's Liberal Party ticket, shortly after his May 1867 retirement as governor. He was a [[constitutional assembly]]man during a number of amendment deliberations, and established the San Luis National College, and the Girls' [[Normal School]] in that province. 

Daract died in [[Villa María]], Córdoba, in 1887. The town of [[Justo Daract, San Luis]] was named in his honor.

'''Labour battalions''' have been a form of [[alternative service]] or [[unfree labour]] in various countries in lieu of or resembling regular [[military service]]. In some cases they were the result of some kind of [[discrimination|discriminative]] segregation of the population, while in some others they have been a conscious choice.

==Political reasons==
In some countries labour battalions were created from part of population which for various reasons were not suitable for regular military service, often because this population was considered "undesirable" or "unreliable", e.g., political enemies, population of occupied territories or "lower [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]]".

Examples include labour battalions in the late [[Ottoman Empire]] and early [[Turkish Republic]] both [[Labour Battalions (Ottoman Empire)|during World War I]] and [[The Twenty Classes|during World War II]], [[labour service (Hungary)|labour service in Hungary during World War II]], as well as labour battalions in other territories held by [[Nazi Germany]] and its allies (see also  "[[Hiwi (volunteer)|Hiwi]]".).

==Alternative service==
In some countries labour battalions are a form of alternative [[conscription]] for people who cannot join military service for various reasons, e.g., due to bad health or being [[conscientious objector]]s to any forms of violence.

Until the last days of the [[Soviet Union]] with obligatory military duty in the state, men deemed unfit to regular military duty, as well as many able-bodied ones, were assigned to ''[[construction battalion (Soviet Union)|construction battalion]]s'' (стройбаты) of the [[Soviet Army]] .

* [[Construction soldier|Bausoldat]] in [[East Germany]]

The '''market contact audit''' is a research tool, which measures the effectiveness of various contacts in a category using a common method and a common unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Palgrave Macmillan Journals |url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jmm/journal/v7/n4/abs/5050100a.html |title=Journals formerly published by Palgrave Macmillan: Palgrave Macmillan Journals |publisher=Palgrave-journals.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it provides a yardstick to understand which are the key contacts that drive the category, which contact points are working better for the brand and which are the ones where money should be saved. It is a planning process that helps in rationalizing and prioritizing the marketing and media spends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.integration-imc.com/WhatIsMCA.asp |title=Integration – About the MCA – What Is The MCA-Marketing Information System? |publisher=Integration-imc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301171637/http://www.integration-imc.com/WhatIsMca.asp |archivedate=1 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The market contact audit measures how successfully brands use marketing communications to connect with consumers in two ways. First it recognizes that some contacts are more influential than others. So it measures the Contact Clout Factor – or contact influence for the important contacts in a given category and market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.integration-imc.com/Insead%20validation%20report.pdf |accessdate=21 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016013742/http://www.integration-imc.com/Insead%20validation%20report.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then it recognizes that some brands execute better than others, so it measures brand experience for each brand in the category and market, by the degree to which consumers recall encountering brands in a contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-138667189/managing-brand-experience-market.html |title=Article: Managing brand experience: the Market Contact Audit[TM&amp;#93;. &amp;#124; AccessMyLibrary – Promoting library advocacy |publisher=AccessMyLibrary |date=1 March 2005 |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline of the MCA research method==
In summary, via consumers' interviews, using [[Monadic Testing|monadic]] cards each with a contact description in consumer language, two interview techniques are used to ascertain the three intrinsic values of contacts for a given [[product category]] and [[Market (economics)|market]]:

* The "process of elimination" is used to develop the Information and Attractive Values of contacts to ascertain their cognitive and emotive influence,&lt;ref&gt;The New Positioning, by Jack Trout and Steve Rivkin, McGraw-Hill, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
* The contacts that are high in either Information or Attractive Value, or both, is then rank-ordered by their importance using the "Just Noticeable Difference" system. This ascertains their Power Value, or their behavioral influence,&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey asks consumers to associate Brands competing in the category with the screened contacts to measure the perceived weight of brands' activities relative to competition. (The questionnaire takes approximately 25 minutes in face-to-face interviews, and has been validated across a variety of [[fieldwork]] techniques – from face to face to self-administered on-line questionnaire.  The questionnaire is well suited to be included in standard brand surveys such as U&amp;A, Awareness and Image studies, etc. and relate them to the universe of contact).

In 1998 the MCA cethod was widened by the discovery of a way to merge the three [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]s of a contact into a single indicator, via a series of [[algorithm]]s. The merging of the three values into one generates a new indicator, the Contact Clout Factor (CCF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/thearf-org-aux-assets/downloads/research/ARF_Review_Integration_MCA.pdf |title=ARF : The Research Authority : First Opinion |publisher=S3.amazon.com |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CCF score indicates the effectiveness of a contact by its capacity to influence attitudes relative to the other contacts screened.

Besides permitting the prioritization of contacts by their measured effectiveness, the CCF also enables the creation of a currency for the comparison of effectiveness and competitiveness of Brand Activities.

==Output==

=== Brand experience points (BEPS) ===
Brand experience points (BEP) is an indicator that reflects the perceived weight of experienced consumer – brand encounters through individual contacts. BEPs are measured by the degree to which consumers associate brands and contacts. These associations are normalized and weighted by the CCF to deliver the BEP levels for each brand against each contact.&lt;ref&gt;First Opinion: An Advertising Research Foundation Research Review of Integration Marketing &amp; Communications Limited’s Market ContactAudit Methodology William A. Cook, Ph.D., Sr. V.P., Research &amp; Standards 20 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher the BEP level for a contact, the more consumers report experiencing the brand in that contact.

The brand contact BEP accounts for the contribution of the brand perceived activity to the overall brand experience. BEP takes into account quantity (level of association of the brand with the contact) and [[Quality (business)|quality]] (association weighted by the respective influence of the contact). Hence an association of 40% on a most influential contact (as rated by consumers) has a clearly different contribution to building brand experience than 40% scored on a less influential contact.
Through BEPs, which are weighted via the CCF, activities can be compared across all brands and among all contacts of the category. Through BEPs, levels of activities can also be compared across markets and categories.

Substantial disparities have been noted in the average levels of BEPs among leaders across categories and markets: The average level of BEP of leaders can range from 500 to 3,000. These disparities are the result of i) different levels of consumer receptiveness; ii) the degree of competitiveness in the category; iii) the type of the category: fragmented (lower levels of BEP) as opposed to fewer brand players (higher levels of BEP).

==Personal life==
She came to America as a friend and protégé of automotive heir [[Henry Buhl]]. Her first husband, Ambassador [[Francis L. Kellogg]], served as a Special Assistant to Secretaries of State [[William P. Rogers]] and [[Henry Kissinger]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; They met while she was working as an executive assistant to a UN official. They married in Geneva, Switzerland, on October 12, 1972. The Mayor of Geneva performed the ceremony. [[Ardeshir Zahedi]] was Kellogg's best man and the Shah's personal emissary at the ceremony.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune, October 14, 1972"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1972/10/14/page/N_A26/article/cream-of-the-crop|title=Cream of the Crop (October 14, 1972)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They lived in an apartment at 775 Park Avenue and maintained an estate in Bedford, New York.

In June 1986, at the 'Black and White Ball' hosted by the Duke of Marlborough at Blenheim Palace, she first met Texas billionnaire Sid Bass. They met again at a Bastille Day party in the Hamptons several weeks later where she caught his attention by throwing a bread roll in his direction. In September 1986 their relationship became public when socialite Sao Schlumberger saw them walking hand-in-hand at the Hotel Plaza Athenee in Paris. She divorced Kellogg and married [[Sid Bass]] on December 10, 1988 at New York's Plaza Hotel.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

In January 1990 they purchased four adjacent properties on Fort Worth's Crestline Road, overlooking the Trinity River valley. Two houses were combined into one large mansion, a third was razed after representatives of charitable causes pried loose all salvageable paneling and plumbing from the premises, and the fourth property was transported across town to the grounds of the Lena Pope Home for Troubled Children. When she discovered that the house across the street could see over the fence into their house, she had Sid buy that house too. It was transported to his brother's ranch.

They divorced in 2011.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/post/love-etc-sid-and-mercedes-bass-divorce/2011/10/10/gIQAr5sSaL_blog.html Love, etc.: Sid and Mercedes Bass divorce], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 10/10/2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the divorce, their 26-acre estate 'Oak Hill' on Crestline Road Fort Worth, their Aspen home and apartment at 845 Fifth Avenue in New York were all transferred to her.&lt;ref name="People Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20117575,00.html|title=Cover Story: Marriage with a Midas Touch – Vol. 33 No. 18|date=7 May 1990|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=LLC|first1=New York Media|title=New York Magazine|date=1986|publisher=New York Media, LLC|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pOcCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA52|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Namibia Chamber of Commerce and Industry'''  is the industrial and Chamber of Commerce in Namibia. It is headquartered in the capital [[Windhoek]]. In March 2013, the Chamber had about 2,500 members.&lt;ref name="allafrica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201405091580.html|title=allAfrica.com: Namibia: More Export Diversification Needed to Create Jobs|publisher=allafrica.com|accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Namibian Chamber of Commerce and Industry was established in 1990 as Namibia National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (NNCCI) in Windhoek. In 1998, the chamber was renamed and transferred to a legally independent, private-sector institution. As part of this realignment, the concept of regional chambers were implemented.&lt;ref name="allafrica2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201405091612.html|title=allAfrica.com: Namibia: Investment Climate Has Improved - NCCI, NMA Says (Page 1 of 2)|publisher=allafrica.com|accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tasks and Structure ==
NCCI is a non-profit organization whose mission is to represent the Namibian business enterprises from all economic sectors. It was on the basis of the Companies Act, Act no. 32 of 1973 established as a state institution. Additional areas of responsibility of the NCCI counts:

*Organizing and conducting conferences and trade shows
*Issues of trade
*Information gathering and reporting

'''Shanzhai''' or '''shan zhai''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|山寨}}|p={{linktext|shānzhài}}|j=saan1 zaai6}}) refers to [[counterfeit consumer goods]], including imitation and trademark infringing brands and/or particularly electronics, in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schmidle|first=Nicholas|title=Inside the Knockoff-Tennis-Shoe Factory|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/magazine/22fake-t.html|accessdate=8 September 2010|newspaper=New York Times|date=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Literally "mountain village" or "mountain stronghold", the term refers to the mountain stockades of regional warlords or bandits, far away from official control. "Shanzhai" can also be stretched to refer to people who are lookalikes, low-quality or improved goods, as well as things done in [[parody]].

==Origin==
According to the ''[[Xiandai Hanyu Dictionary]]'' ({{Lang-zh|c=现代汉语词典/現代漢語詞典|s=|t=|labels=no}}), "Shanzhai" can stand for two meanings:
# A fenced place in the forest.
# Villages in the mountain that have stockade houses.

Historically, "shanzhai" is sometimes used as a metaphor to describe bandits who oppose and evade the corrupted authority to perform deeds they see as justified. One example of such bandits is the story of ''[[Water Margin]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/268947.html?wtp=tt |title=Baidu Encyclopedia "Shanzhai" |publisher=Baike.baidu.com |date=2010-03-23 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of "Shanzhai" to refer to imitation products comes from [[Cantonese]] slang, in which "shanzhai factory" means an ill-equipped, low-end and family-based factory. However, with the accumulation of profit, quite a few of those factories invest a lot of money to improve their equipment. Some factories also get investment from someone other than family members. Nowadays, a significant portion of Shanzhai factories are no longer ill-equipped or family-based. 

Their products are no longer poor-quality. Yet they still can not escape from the fate of no-brand (or fake brand), not-for-sale in top department stores with non-''shanzha''i products.  One of the motivations for going 'Shanzhai' is the difficult regulations the Chinese government had established to become an official mobile phone manufacturer.  So to avoid the hassles companies try to operate under the radar.  They can avoid taxes and regulation in this way.

Another account of the origin is that because imitation electronic appliance manufacturers are largely located in [[Shenzhen]], wholesalers from other parts of China started calling their products "Shenzhen product". Gradually "Shenzhen product" became "Shanzhai product" because they sound similar when people speak [[mandarin Chinese]] with a Cantonese accent.

==Shanzhai products==
The use of "shanzhai" became popular with the outstanding sale performance of "shanzhai" mobile phones. According to [[Gartner]]’s data, 1.15 billion mobile phones were sold worldwide in 2007, and according to data provided by the Chinese government, 150 million "Shanzhai" mobile phones were sold in the same year, thus making up more than one tenth of the global sales.&lt;ref name="Shanzhai’s Destruction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.163.com/09/0420/10/57BBE6EL0009388P.html |title=Shanzhai’s Destruction |publisher=Tech.163.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Financial Times estimated that Shanzhai phones accounted for about 20 per cent of the global [[2G]] mobile phone market.&lt;ref name=mediatek&gt;{{Cite web

The market for "shanzhai" mobile phones is not only in China, but are also found in the surrounding developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The outstanding sales performance of "shanzhai" mobile phones is usually attributed to their low price, multifunctional performance and imitations of trendy mobile phone design. Although "shanzhai" companies do not use branding as a marketing strategy, they are known for their flexibility of design to meet specific market needs. For example, during [[Barack Obama]]’s 2008 U.S. presidential election campaign, "shanzhai" mobile phone companies started selling "Obama" mobile phones in [[Kenya]], with the slogan "yes we can" and Obama’s name on the back of the mobile phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://3zai.org.cn/shanzhai/shanzhaishouji/2009-01/136.html|title=Obama Brand Shanzhai Cell Phone|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also designed "[[Beijing National Stadium|Bird's Nest]]" ({{Lang-zh|c=鸟窝|s=|t=|labels=no}}) and "[[Fuwa]]" ({{Lang-zh|c=福娃|s=|t=|labels=no}}) mobile phones in light of the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympic Games]].

Before the booming shanzhai mobile phone industries, since the early 2000s, imitation electronic products such as DVD players and [[MP3 player|MP3]] players were already manufactured in the [[Pearl River Delta]] ({{Lang-zh|c=珠三角|s=|t=|labels=no}}) area.&lt;ref name="Shanzhai’s Destruction"/&gt; Many shanzhai mobile phone companies accumulated their capital in that process.  After understanding that many buyers  prefer lookalike phones without the blaring of fake logos, many manufacturers adopted a practice of not using fraudulent logos. They instead opt for a generically designed logo. This allows overseas buyers to find a lookalike phone easily, without the fake logo.

Shanzhai mobile phones can be sold at very low prices compared to other mobile phones. On average, the imitations sell at retailers at about $US100-$US150, while production costs are about $US20.&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{Cite news|last=Barboza|first=David|title=In China, Knockoff Cellphones Are a Hit|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2009-04-27|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/technology/28cell.html?hpw|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shanzhai mobile phone factories are able to manufacture at a very low cost for two reasons, they do not buy mobile phone manufacture licenses from the Chinese government, thus saving all the related costs.

CECT is one of the many brands of [[cellular phone]]s manufactured in [[China]]. CECT offers unauthorized [[clone (computing)|clones]] or [[replicas]] of the [[Apple Inc.]] [[iPhone]] and various [[Nokia]] cell phones manufactured in [[China]] and sold at a fraction of the price of the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/technologyNewsMolt/idUKPEK33380420080623|title=Hi-phone anyone?

One company that earned notoriety for producing shanzhai smartphones is [[Goophone]], which in 2012 was reported to have filed a patent for the "Goophone i5", a [[MediaTek]]-powered clone marketed prior to the real [[iPhone 5]]'s official release.&lt;ref name="Hodgkins"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2014/07/16/wico-goophone-iphone-6-clones/|title=Wico and Goophone Beat Apple to Market with Android-Based iPhone 6 Clones|last=Hodgkins|first=Kelly|date=16 July 2014|work=[[MacRumors]]|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are many fake garments, watches, bags, and shoes in China, they are not called "shanzhai" products, perhaps because these fake products came into existence earlier than fake mobile phones and the newer use of the term "shanzhai". "Shanzhai" mobile phones may stand out as the most successful and most often discussed "shanzhai" products, because mobile phones strongly symbolise wealth in China, but they are much more affordable than other symbolic signs of wealth such as cars and apartments.

Quite a few shanzhai mobile phone companies tried to exploit the market by making shanzhai [[Netbooks]], but these gained little market acceptance and sales.

"Shanzhai" electric cars, which run on lead-acid batteries and sell for as little as $US2000-$US3000, are being produced in the Shandong province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.asiasociety.org/chinagreen/shanzhai-electric-car-revolution/ |title=Shanzhai Electric Car Revolution 山寨电动汽车革命|publisher=China Green|date= |accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011 the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the State Administration of Industry and Commerce announced a crackdown on shanzhai phone sellers and manufacturers. The administration blamed "money-stealing" services that used the cheap phones to steal services using customers' SIM cards. Industry commentator Liu Sheng said that it was more likely to be linked to the country's intellectual property rights protection campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Shanzhaiism==
Shanzhaiism ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨主義|s=|t=|labels=no}}) is a philosophical term denoting a Chinese style of innovation with a peasant mind-set. 

Shanzhaiism has an equivalent English term: tinker. Lacking a garage, they build products in villages in the mountains that have stockade houses. However, with shanzhaiism in mind, people can produce fake and counterfeit products in a massively organized way.

Shanzhaiism can be analyzed using a term coined by Jean-Paul Sartre: [[Bad faith (existentialism)|Bad faith]]. Fake and unlicensed products are produced. For example, there was once a so-called  Fake-One Road&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=topic/ada2aje/6RDAUWHUWeg#!topic/ada2aje/6RDAUWHUWeg|title=Whole street of Fake Famous brand name shops to be opened in China - Wenan Jie|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120223062019/http://tw.myblog.yahoo.com/jw!m3yjq.KQGRu5wWDGLuhCpQ--/article?mid=989&amp;prev=990&amp;next=976 Nanjing Shanzhai Street (南京山寨一條街,真是大開眼界..山寨手機/山寨家電/山寨電腦..等等.還有其他的山寨版品牌,以後可以在大陸一次買足 - 雅登廚飾/廚具設計/系統櫥櫃/美國/荷蘭廚房家電--雲林/嘉義生活館) - tw.myblog.yahoo.com]&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨一條街|s=|t=|labels=no}}) in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2408997/Wanda-Plaza-China-lined-counterfeit-brands-called-knock-alley.html|title=Fancy a cheap Starbocks or some Häagen Dezs ice cream?

This kind of phenomena is not confined to fake products. The mind set of shanzhaiism even extends to advertisements. For example, a [https://web.archive.org/web/20121220153346/http://www.clonedinchina.com/2009/06/spokeman-obama-and-a-blackberry-storm-9500-clone.html shanzhai phone advertisement] used the former president of the United States, Obama, to promote its shanzhai products.

==Shanzhai culture==

The frequent reference to shanzhai cell phones on internet and in traditional media made people start labeling low-cost imitation cultural activities as shanzhai as well. Some of the most well-known events include the [[Shanzhai National Spring Gala]] ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨春节联欢晚会|s=|t=|labels=no}}), Shanzhai Lecture Room ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨百家讲坛|s=|t=|labels=no}}), Shanzhai Olympic Torch Relay ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨奥运火炬传递|s=|t=|labels=no}}), and Shanzhai Nobel Prize ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨诺贝尔奖|s=|t=|labels=no}}). One thing these events have in common is that they all imitate high-end, popular yet authoritative events in which grass-roots power usually has no participating role.

While the purpose of the above-mentioned shanzhai events is arguably just for the participants to have fun and to experience being the authority, other shanzhai cultural phenomena, like the shanzhai products, are profit-oriented. For example, some low-end performing agencies will hire [[Doppelgänger|people who look like pop stars]] to perform in rural areas, where people cannot afford to watch the actual stars. Thus shanzhai [[Jay Chou]] ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨周杰伦|s=|t=|labels=no}}), shanzhai [[Andy Lau]] ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨刘德华|s=|t=|labels=no}}) and shanzhai [[Faye Wong]] ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨王菲|s=|t=|labels=no}}) appear in many underdeveloped places in China.

Shanzhai movies are another profit-driven shanzhai phenomenon. These movies usually have low budgets, yet achieve commercial success by [[parody]]ing, making fun of or borrowing elements from high-end [[Hollywood]] blockbuster movies. One of the first shanzhai movies is [[Ning Hao]]’s ({{Lang-zh|c=宁浩|s=|t=|labels=no}}) ''[[Crazy Stone (film)|Crazy Stone]]'' ({{Lang-zh|c=疯狂的石头|s=|t=|labels=no}}). It imitates the multi-angle shooting, rapid cutting and stunts that are usually used in Hollywood action movies, yet it retains the grass-roots Chinese set up. With a 3 million Hong Kong dollar budget, ''Crazy Stone'' achieved 22 million-box-office revenue. Following its success, shanzhai movies like "the Big Movie" series ("{{Lang-zh|c=大电影"系列|s=|t=|labels=no}}") and ''No.2 in the World'' ({{Lang-zh|c=天下第二|s=|t=|labels=no}}) were made. Some also argue that Hollywood parody movies like ''[[Scary Movie]]'' are the true inspirational force behind shanzhai movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shanzhaihuo.com/chinanews/shanzhai-movie-yuanzihaolaiwu-fengkuangdeshitoushibizu.html |title="Shanzhai" Movie is From Hollywood; the "Crazy Stone" is Their Ancestor |publisher=Shanzhaihuo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The heated online debate about whether shanzhai should be encouraged or denounced is arguably due to Ni Ping ({{lang|zh|倪萍}}), a well-known [[China Central Television|CCTV]] host's proposal during the [[Lianghui]] (two conferences) this year.{{which|date=December 2012}} She proposed to establish relevant legislation that will eliminate the shanzhai phenomenon by arguing that the copycat culture associated with shanzhai will stifle genuine creativity and hamper awareness of property rights. While some agree with her, others point out that in order to give objective comment on the shanzhai phenomenon, one has to distinguish shanzhai products from "pirated" products and shanzhai culture from shanzhai products. They also argue that although many shanzhai culture events manifest themselves as copycat events, some also have true original elements. Western media outlets like ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123257138952903561|title=Imitation Is the Sincerest Form of Rebellion in China|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|author=Sky Canaves and Juliet Ye|date=2009-01-22|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The New Yorker]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/evanosnos/2009/03/a-chinese-pirat.html|title=A Chinese Pirate Unmasks|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|author=Evan Osnos|authorlink=Evan Osnos|date=2009-03-05|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; have reported about the shanzhai phenomenon and presented it as a form of rebellion and resistance to the mainstream culture.

[[File:Aerial View of Slough Trading Estate.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|right|Slough Trading Estate:&lt;br /&gt;aerial view looking north-west]]
The '''Slough Trading Estate''' founded in [[Slough]] in the south of Buckinghamshire in 1920, was an early [[Industrial park|business park]] in the United Kingdom. According to the estate's owners and operators, [[SEGRO]] (formerly Slough Estates plc),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sloughte.com/park/STE|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822055731/http://www.sloughte.com/park/STE|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-08-22|title=Slough Trading Estate|author=Helen Murray|work=sloughte.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slough Trading Estate consists of {{convert|486|acre|km2}} of commercial property in Slough and provides {{convert|7500000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of accommodation to 500&amp;nbsp;businesses and has a working population of about 20,000&amp;nbsp;people. Slough Trading Estate is the largest industrial estate in single private ownership in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmbills/001/17.pdf Slough Estates petition to Parliament, Crossrail bill 2005–06]&lt;/ref&gt; There are over 600&amp;nbsp;buildings. The Estate is home to 400&amp;nbsp;tenants from countries including the US, Italy, Japan, Germany and Korea. Companies using the park include, Fiat Group Automobiles UK Ltd, [[Centrica]], [[Yell Group|Yell]], [[Electrolux]], [[GlaxoSmithKline]], [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars Confectionery]], [[Akzo Nobel]], [[Virgin Media]], [[O2 (United Kingdom)|O2]], the datacentre operator [[Network-i]] and [[Oki Electric Industry|OKI Printing Solutions]]. It is also home to important small, medium and large businesses.

The estate's power station supplies heat and power to the entire industrial site, by burning wood chips and other biomass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sloughheatandpower.co.uk/ Slough Heat and Power webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Langley Business Park'' and ''Langley Business Centre'' are other thriving business estates in Slough, with other companies, industries and enterprises found throughout the borough.

==History==

In June 1918, land to the west of Slough (then in [[Buckinghamshire]]) and adjacent to the [[Great Western Railway]] main line, mainly forming part of [[Cippenham]] Court Farm&lt;ref&gt;p28, ''Slough – A Century of Change'', Peter Burgess and Judith Hunter, Nonsuch pocket edition, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; but also including the site of an isolation hospital,&lt;ref&gt;p62, ''Around Slough in old photographs'', Judith Hunter and Karen Hunter, Budding Books, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; was bought by the government to form a motor repair depot for army transport. The depot was intended to receive broken down vehicles by train from the battlefront, repair them, and return them to service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1839663|title=Slough Trading Estate|work=everything2.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was not regarded as a success. The depot was believed to be so urgent that construction work (eventually by construction company [[Sir Robert McAlpine]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arborfieldhistory.org.uk/WW1/WW1_Motor_Depot.htm|title=Arborfield Local History Society - WW1 - Slough Motor Depot a White Elephant|work=arborfieldhistory.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; began in July 1918 without harvesting the crops on the land, but the site was still under construction when the armistice was agreed in November 1918.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;p 109, ''The History of Slough'', Maxwell Fraser, Slough Corporation, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the depot's fundamental purpose went with the end of the war, [[Jan Smuts|General Jan Smuts]] proposed a post-war use for the depot which was implemented. Rather than scrapping the many army surplus vehicles, they were sent to Slough for repair prior to sale.&lt;ref&gt;p. 109, ''The History of Slough'', Maxwell Fraser, Slough Corporation, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this use, for many years (until at least the 1980s), the site was known locally and colloquially as 'the dump', and at the time of the depot's development it was also known as 'The White Elephant'. 

Relations between management and workforce were so poor (partly due to the militancy of [[Wal Hannington]]) that in April 1920 the entire workforce was sacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,760751,00.html|title=Foreign News: Wal's Work|date=20 February 1939|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ourhistory-hayes.blogspot.com/2009/10/wal-hannington-and-slough-soviet-1920.html Wal Hannington and the Slough Soviet 1920&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government Surplus Disposal Board]] sold the 2.7 square kilometre (600 acre) site and its contents (17,000 used cars, trucks and motorcycles, and 170,000 square metres (1.8 million sq ft) of covered workshops) for over seven million pounds. [[Percival Perry, 1st Baron Perry|Sir Percival Perry]], who had effectively established the British operations of the [[Ford Motor Company]] and who had been appointed Assistant Controller of the UK government's [[Agricultural Machinery Department]] during the war,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seriouswheels.com/art-Ford-Europe.htm|title=Ford in Europe:  The First Hundred Years|work=seriouswheels.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sir [[Noel Mobbs]], led the group of investors who acquired the depot, establishing the [[Slough Trading Co. Ltd]].
 
Repair and sale of ex-army vehicles continued until 1925 when the Slough Trading Company Act was passed allowing the company (renamed [[Slough Estates Ltd]]) to establish an [[Industrial park|Industrial Estate]]. The existing army buildings were tenanted as factories, and additional units were built. Those on the [[A4 road (Great Britain)|Bath Road]] and Farnham Road frontages were designed with fundamentally uniform simple [[Art Deco]] offices on the front.  Shared facilities were provided for workforce and employers, including a fire station, restaurant,&lt;ref&gt;p118, ''Around Slough in old photographs'', Judith Hunter and Karen Hunter, Budding Books, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; shops and banks, a large [[community centre]] (1937) and the Slough Industrial Health Service (1947).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Early businesses established on the trading estate included [[Citroën]] (1926), [[Global Gillette|Gillette]], [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] and High Duty Alloys.&lt;ref&gt;p15, ''Memories of Slough'', True North Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, they were joined by [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars Ltd]] and [[Berlei|Berlei (UK) Limited]]. In late 1933 the Slough Estates Journal reported there were 'more than 150 companies' based on the estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cassell|first=Michael|title=Long Lease!, The Story of Slough Estates 1920 – 1991|publisher=Pencorp Books|location=London|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Trading Estate grew despite the [[Great Depression|depression]] of the 1920s and 1930s, people were attracted from all over the country to come and find work in Slough. But the fast increase in population resulted in a shortage of housing.

One solution was the construction of Timbertown, an estate of wooden single storey houses built adjacent to the site occupied by the Community Centre and now occupied by [[Herschel Grammar School]].

From the outside, the houses looked like an army barracks, but inside they were spacious and comfortable – with 3 bedrooms, a bathroom, a big kitchen and a living room. At the start, Timbertown was well cared for a popular community, with a shop, social hut and even a Sunday school. But the buildings soon started to deteriorate. The wooden houses had never been intended to be permanent and Timbertown was finally demolished in the 1930s to make way for new buildings.

From the late 1950s the estate became home to [[Gerry Anderson]]'s AP Films, producing a string of successful puppet series for [[Associated Television|ATV]].

In 1963 Ford set up Ford Advanced Vehicles on the estate to build the [[Ford GT40]] racing sports car with design input from [[Eric Broadley]] of [[Lola Cars]], who subsequently fell out with Ford and used the factory (which was in his company's name) to re-establish his independent operation. Ford moved to another factory on the Estate.

Until 1973, the estate had a railway directly linking the factories to Britain's railway system. A passenger service ran from [[Paddington railway station|Paddington]] and [[Slough railway station|Slough station]]s to a separate station (accessed by a spur from the main line, separate from the freight access to the estate),&lt;ref&gt;map V and caption, ''Slough to Newbury'', Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; until 1956.&lt;ref&gt;picture 80 and caption, ''Slough: A Pictorial History'', Judith Hunter &amp; Isobel Thompson, Phillimore &amp; Co, Chichester, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, the estate's [[power station]] was sold to [[Scottish and Southern Energy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottish-southern.co.uk/SSEInternet/index.aspx?id=11384&amp;TierSlicer1_TSMenuTargetID=1364&amp;TierSlicer1_TSMenuTargetType=1&amp;TierSlicer1_TSMenuID=6 Scottish and Southern complete acquisition of Slough Heat and Power] accessed 5 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

Slough Trading Estate has a [[Local nature reserve]] on the Western border of the estate called [[Haymill Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx?startTopic=Designations&amp;activelayer=lnrIndex&amp;query=REF_CODE%3D%271008944%27 |title=Magic Map Application |publisher=Magic.defra.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==In popular culture==
In 1937, English poet [[John Betjeman]] wrote his poem ''[[Slough (poem)|Slough]]'' in protest against the expansion of the Slough Trading Estate.  The poem bemoans the loss of the area's rural character, and pillories English society's increasing consumerism and the sweatshop conditions caused by large-scale industrial development.  An excerpt: "Come, friendly bombs and fall on Slough / It isn't fit for humans now...."

The [[Ricky Gervais]]/[[Stephen Merchant]] comedy ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' is set on Slough Trading Estate. The opening sequence shows several locations in Slough and the Crossbow House building on the Trading Estate where fictional paper merchants Wernham Hogg are supposedly located. It is also referenced in the song "Slough" from the 2016 film [[David Brent: Life on the Road]].

'''''The Call''''' is an American television business news program which on [[CNBC]] between 11AM to 12 noon ET weekdays from August 2007 to October 2011. Previous programs shown in the same time slot were ''[[The Money Wheel]]'' with [[Ted David]] and [[Martha MacCallum]] and ''[[Market Watch]]'' and ''[[Morning Call (TV program)|Morning Call]]''. ''The Call'' offered a clear focus on real-time market coverage at the heart of the trading day.

==About the program==
Until July 19, 2007, CNBC aired ''[[Morning Call (TV program)|Morning Call]]'' from 10AM to 12 noon ET weekdays. The next day, CNBC replaced the first hour of the two-hour program with an expanded ''[[Squawk on the Street]]'', due in part to [[Liz Claman]]'s departure from the network&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnbc/cnbcs_new_mornings_squawk_on_the_street_expands_to_two_hours_63384.asp#more mediabistro.com: TVNewser&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (she joined the [[Fox Business Network]] three months later).  The program was completely revamped on July 23, 2007, and renamed ''The Call'' on August 7, 2007, with [[Dylan Ratigan]] and [[Trish Regan]] serving as interim anchors.  Ratigan (live from the [[New York Stock Exchange]]), Regan and [[Melissa Francis]] were appointed permanent co-anchors as of October 8, 2007.  In addition to the aforementioned July 2007 revamp, the anchors were joined on set by a guest contributor, very similar to ''[[Squawk Box]]''.

Dylan Ratigan left ''The Call'' in late 2008 as he was replaced with [[Larry Kudlow]].  Melissa Francis and Trish Regan both remained on the program, with Francis anchoring alongside Kudlow at the network's Englewood Cliffs studio and Regan anchoring at the NYSE.  Ratigan ultimately left CNBC altogether in March 2009.  Trish Regan departed from CNBC 2 years later (March 2011).   [[Amanda Drury]] (formerly of [[CNBC Asia]]) replaced Regan as co-host until she left for ''[[Street Signs (television show)|Street Signs]]'' in mid-2011.

Regular reporters included [[Bob Pisani]] ([[NYSE]]), [[Scott Wapner]] ([[NASDAQ]]), [[Sharon Epperson]] ([[NYMEX]]), [[Rick Santelli]] ([[Chicago]]), [[Steve Liesman]], [[David Faber (CNBC)|David Faber]] and [[Brian Shactman]].

'''The Trump Network''' was a [[multi-level marketing]] company named after businessman and current [[U.S. President]] [[Donald Trump]]. The company, which sold vitamins and health products, was initially founded as Ideal Health in 1997, before being renamed in 2009 as part of a licensing agreement between Trump and the owners. The licensing agreement expired at the end of 2011, and the company's remaining assets were sold to Bioceutica the following year.

==History==
===Ideal Health===
Ideal Health, Inc. was founded as a [[multi-level marketing]] company in March 1997.&lt;ref name=founders&gt;{{cite web|title=The Founders|url=http://www.idealhealth.com:80/Company/Founders.aspx|publisher=Ideal Health, Inc.|accessdate=July 13, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123233635/http://www.idealhealth.com/Company/Founders.aspx|archivedate=November 23, 2005|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.businessforhome.org/2012/02/the-trump-network-lawsuit-going-down-fast/|title= The Trump Network Lawsuit – Going Down Fast?|last= Nuyten|first= Ted|date= February 1, 2012|website= Business for Home|access-date=July 12, 2017|quote=In March of 1997, Ideal Health started [...].}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company, headquartered in [[Lynnfield, Massachusetts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact us|url=http://www.idealhealth.com:80/contact.htm|publisher=Ideal Health Systems, Inc.|accessdate=July 13, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010203222300/http://www.idealhealth.com/contact.htm|archivedate=February 3, 2001|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded by Lou DeCaprio and brothers Scott and Todd Stanwood,&lt;ref name=NYMag/&gt; who were friends of DeCaprio.&lt;ref name=Rowley/&gt; The three men had previously opened New England Wine and Spirits in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]] in 1991. After the Stanwoods' sister had joined a direct sales company in 1989, she encouraged them to get involved in the industry.&lt;ref name=Rowley/&gt; The three men worked for [[Nu Skin Enterprises]], a multi-level marketing company, and decided to form Ideal Health after seeing how successful Nu Skin had become.&lt;ref name=Rowley/&gt;

Ideal Health hired salespeople who would then conduct their own marketing to sell a customized vitamin supplement program, which was determined through a [[urinalysis]] test to learn about the customer's health.&lt;ref name=Chandler/&gt; Salespeople made money through [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]] on sales and by recruiting other salespeople.&lt;ref name=Chandler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rowley/&gt; The products were shipped directly to customers rather than being stored by company salespeople.&lt;ref name=Chandler&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohn|first=Ari|title=Chandler teacher turns to Trump in lean times|url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/news/chandler-teacher-turns-to-trump-in-lean-times/article_02293d77-9a11-56ca-b62f-0a22324f6889.html|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=[[East Valley Tribune]]|date=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2004, numerous complaints had been filed with the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) against Ideal Health, by salespeople who alleged that they spent thousands of dollars on company products that did not generate revenue.&lt;ref name=NYMag/&gt;&lt;ref name=NR/&gt; One of Ideal Health's products, Supreme Greens, was the subject of an FTC lawsuit for its false claim of being able to cure cancer.&lt;ref name=NYMag/&gt; In 2004, Ideal Health acquired and began selling a line of skin-care products known as  BIO Essentials.&lt;ref name=founders/&gt;

===The Trump Network===
In 2008 Donald Trump began searching for a [[Multi-level marketing|network marketing]] company with which to become associated. Trump's lawyer Jerry Schrager met DeCaprio during a business presentation that DeCaprio was doing in New York City.&lt;ref name=NYMag&gt;{{cite news|last=Pressler|first=Jessica|title="If I Can't Trust Donald Trump, Who Can I Trust?"

Trump later recalled, "We hit it off. I checked into their past, and they were solid people. They had a nice track record, but even more importantly they had a lot of people who thought highly of them."&lt;ref name=Moniker/&gt; 

In March 2009 Trump agreed to license his name to the company, which would be re-branded as The Trump Network. Trump also agreed to make occasional appearances at events to promote the company's products.&lt;ref name=Moniker/&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt; Trump had initially considered taking a financial stake in the company.&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt; DeCaprio remained as the [[President (corporate title)|president]] of the company,&lt;ref name=NYMag/&gt; while Todd Stanwood served as the [[chief executive officer]] and Scott Stanwood served as the vice president of communications.&lt;ref name=Rowley/&gt; The Trump Network launched on November 13, 2009, with a ceremony attended by Trump and held at the Hyatt Regency hotel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nobile|first1=Phil|title=Donald Trump's biggest business hits and misses|url=http://www.newsday.com/business/donald-trump-s-biggest-business-hits-and-misses-includes-trump-steaks-the-apprentice-1.11614966|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=[[Newsday]]|date=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in downtown [[Miami]].&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheStar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Herald&gt;{{cite news|last=McConville|first=Christine|title=Newbury vitamin company gets boost with Donald Trump as partner|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/business/business_markets/2009/11/newbury_vitamin_company_gets_boost_donald_trump_partner|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=[[Boston Herald]]|date=November 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=The Donald in Destin: As Trump Network forms, can towers be far behind?|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=The Destin Log|date=November 18, 2009|url-access=subscription|via=[[NewsBank]]|quote=McKinney attended the official launch of The Trump Network, which was attended by The Donald himself, in Miami on Nov. 13.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump referred to the company as a "rescue and recovery program" for people who were suffering from the effects of the [[Great Recession in the United States|Great Recession]] and who needed extra income. For $48 people who wanted to be salespeople could buy a marketing kit and three months of access to a personalized web site to promote the company products. Also available was a $497 package that also included coupons, CDs, and sales tips. Marketers had the right to sell any unsold inventory back to the company.&lt;ref name=TheStar&gt;{{cite news|last=Lush|first=Tamara|title=Donald Trump wants you to sell his nutrition products|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2009/11/19/donald_trump_wants_you_to_sell_his_nutrition_products.html|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=The Star|agency=Associated Press|date=November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Packaging for the company's products was imprinted with Trump's family crest, but the lineup of products remained mostly the same.&lt;ref name=NYMag/&gt; Trump created a scientific advisory committee to evaluate the products sold by the company.&lt;ref name=DB/&gt; Trump also registered 18 negative Internet [[domain name]]s, including TrumpNetworkFraud.com and DonaldTrumpPonziScheme.com, to prevent websites from being registered with those names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sisak|first=Micharl R.|title=Trump is master of his domains, even ones that bash him|url=https://apnews.com/2c17b3bf329147a4bcf92ec6f3dfa2d7/trump-master-his-domains-even-ones-bash-him|accessdate=July 12, 2017|agency=Associated Press|date=November 1, 2016|quote=Trump and his team didn't take any chances in 2009 when he created the Trump Network brand to sell vitamins and other health products.

As of March 2010 Trump Network products were available in each U.S. state, with plans to expand to other countries.&lt;ref name=Rowley/&gt; By then the company had relocated to a larger building at 428 [[Newburyport Turnpike]] in [[Rowley, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=Moniker/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rowley&gt;{{cite news|last=Curley Katzman|first=Katie|title=Trump builds a new empire... in Rowley|url=http://www.eagletribune.com/news/local_news/trump-builds-a-new-empire-in-rowley/article_bc1436c9-9ec8-5219-babf-d06a546c9aee.html|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=[[The Eagle-Tribune]]|date=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Trump Network|url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-trump-network_13|website=LinkedIn|accessdate=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The company had previously been headquartered at 12 Kent Way in [[Byfield, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Trump Network Corporate Headquarters|url=http://www.trumpnetwork.com:80/Contact/Default.aspx|publisher=The Trump Network|accessdate=July 12, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629050008/http://www.trumpnetwork.com/Contact/Default.aspx|archivedate=June 29, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of Trump's surname increased the number of salespeople who signed up with the company.&lt;ref name=Moniker&gt;{{cite news|last=Ailworth|first=Erin|title=Firm's new moniker may be its Trump card: After partnering with the Donald, the former Ideal Health takes off|url=http://archive.boston.com/business/articles/2010/12/07/firms_new_moniker_may_be_its_trump_card/|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 2010, the company had grown 373 percent since Trump became involved,&lt;ref name=PR&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nbcs-the-apprentice-leads-candidates-to-the-trump-network-111679704.html|title= NBC's The Apprentice Leads Candidates to The Trump Network|date= December 10, 2010|website= [[PR Newswire]]|access-date=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had doubled its staff to approximately 50, with an additional 20,000 salespeople worldwide, up from 5,000 people prior to Trump's involvement. The company stated that revenue, at that time, was nearly $40 million.&lt;ref name=Moniker/&gt; Stephanie Castagnier, Liza Mucheru-Wisner, and Steuart Martens, who were candidates on the [[The Apprentice (U.S. season 10)|tenth season]] of Trump's [[reality television]] series, ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]'', became salespeople for The Trump Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tine|first=Victor|title='Apprentice' makes house call in Rowley|url=http://www.newburyportnews.com/news/local_news/apprentice-makes-house-call-in-rowley/article_e2a9276a-5986-5fbb-92aa-4e9577dc7317.html|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=Newburyport News|date=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PR/&gt;

As of January 2011, The Trump Network had plans to add additional products and expand to Europe and Asia, while Trump hoped for the company to ultimately become larger than [[Amway]], its largest competitor.&lt;ref name=NYMag/&gt; That month, DeCaprio addressed claims that salespeople were not earning money through the company: "Many times, if people aren't having success in recruiting, it has to do with not believing in themselves." Trump stated, "This is supposed to be a second income for people. This is not about them quitting their job. [Though] for some of them, it ''might'' lead to that."&lt;ref name=NYMag/&gt; In late 2011, Trump's licensing contract with the company ended.&lt;ref name=WaPo&gt;{{cite news|last=Swanson|first=Ana|title=The Trump Network sought to make people rich, but left behind disappointment|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/23/the-trump-network-sought-to-make-people-rich-but-left-behind-disappointment/|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioceutica purchased the Trump Network's assets in early 2012 for an undisclosed amount of money,&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt;&lt;ref name=HuffPo&gt;{{cite news|title=Exactly How Bogus Were Those 'Trump Vitamins?'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/healthline-/exactly-how-bogus-were-th_b_10268610.html|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NR&gt;{{cite news|last=Tuttle|first=Ian|title=Add Another Yuuge Failure to Trump's Pile: The Trump Network|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/432468/trump-networks-failure-harmed-small-investors|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=[[National Review]]|date=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; marking the end of the company.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt;

Some salespeople were disappointed to learn that Trump did not have a larger role in the company.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt;&lt;ref name=NR/&gt; In January 2016, Scott Stanwood declined to discuss the company because of confidentiality agreements. Trump's lawyer, Alan Garten, said many salespeople did "very well" and noted that Trump's role in the company was limited to the licensing of his surname and to providing motivational speeches to salespeople:&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt; "Anyone who claims that they were not aware of the extent of Mr. Trump's role is lying to himself." The company's website had included a disclaimer that read, "The Trump Network is not owned nor are any products sold over 'The Trump Network' developed or manufactured by Donald J. Trump or any entity owned or controlled by Donald J. Trump."&lt;ref name=Chicago&gt;{{cite news|title=Losses, regrets and questions at companies Trump endorsed|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-trump-companies-20160127-story.html|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=January 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garten later stated that Trump's role "was clearly disclosed, to everyone involved in the company and its members, whether it be in the member's independent contractor agreements, the marketing materials, or on the products themselves."&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt;

==Products==
As of 2011, The Trump Network offered two multivitamins: Prime Essentials and Custom Essentials, the latter being more expensive. Custom Essentials used a urinalyses test known as PrivaTest to determine the vitamins required by each customer.&lt;ref name=Rowley/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYMag/&gt; At the time, Trump Network also offered children's health snacks known as Snazzle Snaxxs, as well as QuikStik [[energy drink]]s and a diet program known as Silhouette Solutions. After Trump became involved, the company added a line of skin-care products known as BioCé Cosmeceuticals.&lt;ref name=Rowley/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYMag/&gt; As of July 2017, the PrivaTest was still available via Bioceutica's website.&lt;ref name=HuffPo/&gt;

Some nutritional experts noted that there was no evidence that the vitamins provided any benefits to people who consumed them; they also criticized the PrivaTest, stating that no urine test can reveal whether a person has a vitamin deficiency.&lt;ref name=HuffPo/&gt; [[Harvard University]] doctor Pieter Cohen considered the PrivaTest to be a "scam," calling it "a bogus program to make profit for the people who are selling it. It's fantasy."&lt;ref name=DB&gt;{{cite news|last1=Haglage|first1=Abby|last2=Mak|first2=Tim|title=Trump Vitamins Were Fortified With B.S.|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-vitamins-were-fortified-with-bs|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computing]], '''Web-Based Enterprise Management''' ('''WBEM''') comprises a set of [[systems management | systems-management]] technologies developed  to unify the management of [[distributed computing]] environments. The WBEM initiative, initially sponsored in 1996 by BMC Software, Cisco Systems, Compaq Computer, Intel, and Microsoft, is now widely adopted.&lt;ref name=Todd&gt;{{cite web|last1=Todd|first1=Greg|title=What is WBEM?|url=http://windowsitpro.com/systems-management/what-wbem|website=Windows IT Pro|accessdate=13 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151113060813/http://windowsitpro.com/systems-management/what-wbem|archivedate=13 November 2015|date=June 30, 1998|deadurl=no|quote=In 1996, BMC Software, Cisco Systems, Compaq Computer, Intel, and Microsoft sponsored the Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) initiative, an effort to provide a unifying mechanism for describing and sharing management information.}}&lt;/ref&gt; WBEM is based on [[Internet standard]]s and [[Distributed Management Task Force]] (DMTF) [[open standard]]s: 

* [[Common Information Model (computing)|Common Information Model]] (CIM) infrastructure and schema
** CIM-[[XML]]
** CIM operations over [[HTTP]]
* [[WS-Management]] for [[web services]]

Although the name labels WBEM as "web-based", it is not necessarily dependent on any particular [[user interface]] (see below). Other systems-management approaches include [[remote shell]]s, proprietary solutions and [[IETF]] standardized [[network management | network-management]] architectures like the [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]] and [[netconf]].

==Features==

WBEM allows the management of any element in a standard and inter-operable manner. 

WBEM provides the technology underlying different management initiatives in [[information technology]]:

* desktop management ([[Desktop and mobile Architecture for System Hardware|DASH]])
* [[network management]] ([[Network management|NetMan]])
* storage management ([[Storage Management Initiative – Specification |SMI]])
* systems management ([[Systems Management Architecture for Server Hardware|SMASH]])
* virtualization management ([[Virtualization Management Initiative |VMAN]])

==Architecture==

To understand the WBEM architecture, consider the components which lie between the operator trying to manage a device (configure it, turn it off and on, collect alarms, etc.) and the actual hardware and software of the device:

# the operator will invoke some form of [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), [[Browser User Interface]] (BUI), or [[command-line interface]] (CLI). The WBEM standard has nothing to say about this interface (although the definition of a CLI for specific applications has started): WBEM operates independently of the human interface, since human interfaces can change without the rest of the system needing to note such changes.
# the GUI, BUI or CLI will interface with a WBEM client through a small set of [[application programming interface]]s (APIs). This client will find the WBEM server for the managed device (typically on the device itself) and construct an XML message containing the request.
# the client will use the HTTP (or [[https|HTTPS]]) protocol to pass the request, encoding it in [[CIM-XML]], to the WBEM server
# the WBEM server will decode the incoming request, perform the necessary authentication and authorization checks and then consult the previously defined model of the managed device to see how to handle the request. This model provides the power of the architecture: it represents the pivot point of the transaction, with the client simply interacting with the model and the model interacting with the real hardware or software. The model uses the Common Information Model standard; the [[Distributed Management Task Force|DMTF]] has published many models for commonly managed devices and services: [[multilayer switch|IP routers]], [[file server|storage servers]], [[desktop computer]]s, etc.
# for most operations, the WBEM server determines from the model that it needs to communicate with the actual hardware or software. So-called "providers" handle the interaction: small pieces of code interface between the WBEM server (using a standardised interface known as [[Common Manageability Programming Interface|CMPI]])&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/linuxonibm/liaav/cmpi-overview.pdf The Common Manageability Programming Interface]
&lt;/ref&gt; and the real hardware or software. Because the interface is well-defined and the number of types of call is small, it is normally easy to write providers. In particular, the writer of the provider knows nothing of the GUI, BUI, or CLI used by the operator.

==WBEM specifications==

*Mappings
**[[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]] (WBEM URI Mapping Specification 1.0)
**[[XML]] (xmlCIM as used in CIM-XML)
**[[XML]] (WS-CIM as used in WS-Management)
**[[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]
*Protocols
**[[CIM-XML]] 
**[[WS-Management]]
**[[CIM-RS]] 
*Discovery
**[[Service Location Protocol|SLP]] (WBEM Discovery using SLP; SLP Template)
*Query Language
**[[CIM_Query_Language|CQL]] (CIM Query Language 1.0)
**[[Filter_Query_Language|FQL]] (Filter Query Language 1.0)

==Implementing support==

So, which pieces of this does a device manufacturer or service provider have to write? 

* Firstly the model.
:This is normally done by extending as necessary one of the standard models published by the [[DMTF]]. 
* Then the BUI, GUI, or CLI. 
:The client and server usually do not need to be written because there are many open-source and commercial implementations available (see [[#External links|External links]] below)
* Then the providers
:In summary, the WBEM architecture allows the manufacturer of a device or developer of a service to provide a standards-compliant management interface to that device simply and cheaply.

== Implementations ==
