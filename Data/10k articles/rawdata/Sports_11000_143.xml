The '''[[1979–80 NHL season|1979–80]] [[Edmonton Oilers]] season''' was the Oilers' [[Edmonton Oilers seasons|eighth]] [[Season (sports)|season]], their first season in the National Hockey League (NHL), as they were one of the teams that were part of the [[WHA-NHL merger]] that took place on June 22, 1979.

The Oilers were led offensively by rookie superstar [[Wayne Gretzky]], as he tied for the lead league in points at 137, however lost the [[Art Ross Trophy]] due to scoring fewer goals than winner [[Marcel Dionne]].  Gretzky, however, would win the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] as MVP of the NHL, but was declared ineligible for the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] due to his playing days in the [[World Hockey Association|WHA]].

Edmonton played six goaltenders during the season, and was led by [[Eddie Mio]]'s nine wins, while [[Ron Low]], who came over in a trade with the [[Quebec Nordiques]], would go 8–2–1 in 11 games with the Oilers.

They would make the playoffs, however were quickly swept out by the powerful [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in 3 games, but Oilers fans were very excited about being part of the NHL, and of the future of the team.

[[File:Karpow 1981 Meran.png|thumb|[[Anatoly Karpov]] and [[Viktor Korchnoi]] beginning the first game of the [[World Chess Championship 1981]]]]

The major chess events of 1981 were the final match of the [[Candidates Tournament]] (between [[Viktor Korchnoi]] and [[Robert Hübner]]) and the [[World Chess Championship 1981|second Karpov–Korchnoi World Chess Championship match]].
== Candidates Tournament Final ==
{{main article|World Chess Championship 1981}}

The final of the Candidates Tournament 1980–81 was held from December 1980 to January 1981 in the Palace Hotel in [[Merano]], Italy. All earlier rounds of the tournament had been held in 1980. The winner of the tournament would be endorsed by [[FIDE]] to challenge the reigning champion, [[Anatoly Karpov]] (Soviet Union) to a match for the title of World Chess Champion. The finalists were Viktor Korchnoi (Switzerland) and Robert Hübner (West Germany), who had qualified for the final through an 8-player match knockout tournament. The other players of the tournament were [[András Adorján]], [[Tigran Petrosian]], [[Lev Polugaevsky]] (Soviet Union), [[Lajos Portisch]] (Hungary), [[Boris Spassky]] (France) and [[Mikhail Tal]] (Soviet Union). Tal, Petrosian and Spassky were former World Champions. The format of the final was a 16-game match. Hübner abandoned the match after completing games 1 to 8 and partially playing, adjourning and then abandoning unfinished games 9 and 10. This made Korchnoi the winner of the Candidates Tournament. Korchnoi had 4½ points to Hübner's 3½ and had won 3 games, lost 2 games and drawn 3 games.

== World Chess Championship match ==
{{main article|World Chess Championship 1981}}
The World Chess Championship 1981 was a match contested from 1 October to 19 November between the defending World Champion, Karpov and the challenger,  Korchnoi. The first player to gain 6 wins would be awarded the title of World Chess Champion. Like the Candidates final, the match was held in Merano. Anatoly Karpov had been FIDE's recognized World Champion since 1975, when [[World Chess Championship 1975|he gained the title by forfeit]] from [[Bobby Fischer]] (United States). Karpov and Korchnoi had both played only one World Chess Championship match prior to 1981, a very close match against one another in 1978 which was won by Karpov (+6 -5 =21).

Karpov, over 18 games, gained the required 6 wins to retain his title. Karpov won 6 games, lost 2 games and drew 10 games. Due to the decisiveness of the match, it was dubbed "the Massacre in Merano".

The club plays their home matches at [[Stade Louis Ganivet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/national/tahiti/super-ligue-mana/20122013/championship-round/r20282/venues/?ICID=PL_3N_06|title=Venues - Ligue 1 - Tahiti - Results, fixtures, tables and news - Soccerway|work=soccerway.com|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club became the second [[French Polynesia]]n team to have reached the final of the [[Oceania Club Championship|OFC Champions League]], which they achieved in [[2012 OFC Champions League Final|2012]].

'''All Star Baseball''' is one of the two most popular [[baseball]] [[board game]]s of the last sixty years,{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} and has been honored as one of the fifty most influential American board games of all time.{{by whom|date=March 2011}} It was manufactured by [[Cadaco|Cadaco-Ellis]] and designed by [[baseball]] player [[Ethan Allen (baseball)|Ethan Allen]].

The game first appeared in 1941 and a special version is still sold today. It was the best-selling baseball board game of all time,{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} and is the only such game to have been distributed through mass market channels and toy stores for any extended period of time.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} The annual versions of the game were discontinued in the mid-1990s due to the loss of market share to [[video game]]s and greatly increased player licensing costs, but a commemorative version was issued in 2003.

Unlike more simulation-focused competitors, most notably [[Strat-o-Matic]] Baseball, ''ASB'' is aimed at a younger audience and is simpler to play. The initial target audience was boys 9–12 years old. It simulates batters' performance well, but makes no attempt to model the performance of individual pitchers.

Nevertheless, many fans passionately bought each year's cards and collected statistics from neighborhood leagues, some amassing as many as 2,500 games worth of paper box scores and comparing those totals with the actual players' statistics.

==Game play==
The game board for ''ASB'' has two spinners on top of a diagram of a baseball field. A hole for a baserunner peg is cut at the location of each base. A cardboard back panel is inserted into cut-out slots in the board, displays the key to the game cards and cardboard wheels that can be turned to display the correct inning, the number of outs and the score.

Each circular player card has a series of lines and numbers arranged in a circle around its center. The card is placed on a spinner, which the batting player spins. (Aficionados would spin the metal pointers with rubber bands to avoid blisters.) Once the spinner came to rest between two lines, the number for that section defined what happened to that batter.

If one or more runners were on base, the pitching player would spin the other spinner, which displayed zones that defined whether runners advanced, scored or were out on the play.

Some special plays, as well as attempted steals, required the use of two special pink situation cards, which went on the pitching player's spinner and indicated the result when spun.

There were no pitching cards nor fielding cards, although pitchers' batting statistics were present on their cards. This made the game inherently less mathematically accurate than its older-audience rivals.

The chart for the meaning of each number on the cards is below. The earliest versions of ''ASB'' utilized this list:
*1 Home Run
*2 Ground out, double play with runner on first base
*3 Runner reaches base on error
*4 Fly out, all runners advance
*5 Triple
*6 Ground out, all runners advance
*7 Single, runners advance one base
*8 Fly out, runner on third base scores, others hold
*9 Walk (Base on balls)
*10 Strikeout
*11 Double
*12 Ground out, runners advance if forced
*13 Single, runners advance two bases
*14 Fly out, runners hold their bases

Later versions featured a simpler chart, augmented by second spins on the fielding player's side (presumably to give that player more to do), with only the "3" section fundamentally changed:
*1 Home Run
*2 Ground out
*3 Fly out (Formerly ''Safe on error'')
*4 Fly out
*5 Triple
*6 Ground out
*7 Single
*8 Fly out
*9 Walk (Base on balls)
*10 Strikeout
*11 Double
*12 Ground out
*13 Single
*14 Fly out

For the 1975 release, the batting chart was reduced to the eight possible results:
*1 Home Run
*2 Triple
*3 Double
*4 Single
*5 Fly Out
*6 Ground Out
*7 Base on Balls
*8 Strikeout

All other rules of the game match those of regular baseball.

==Players==
Until about 1980 ''ASB'' had a mix of current Major League stars and [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] players. As more athletes (and their estates) asserted licensing rights over the use of their names the old-time players were dropped from the game, although a handful of individuals were included occasionally in an annual set.

Each of the then current players were asked to sign off on a release form granting permission to include their batting statistics in the game. This practice continued for almost 50 years after the introduction of the game. Although a few declined, most agreed despite the fact that they were not compensated for being included.

In 1995 the game came under the [[MLBPA]] license, which made the design of the game cards more sophisticated but also added significantly to the cost of production. Since the change in its business model to absorb the MLBPA royalties Cadaco has stopped issuing regular annual updates to the game, and its publishing future remains unclear.

Although numbers have varied, the typical ''ASB'' boxed set contained 40 player cards for early sets, and 63 player cards for later sets.

==Cards==
During most of its history ''ASB'' has had annual updates of its boxed board game with new players and updated stats. During some eras Cadaco-Ellis has also sold older cards by mail, and in recent years the cards have become popular on [[ebay]].

As part of the special 2003 commemorative version, Cadaco also issued separate individually packaged sets of player cards for an All-Star Player Pack, the 2003 Ultimate Series ([[New York Yankees]] vs. [[Florida Marlins]]) and the 2003 Fantasy Series ([[Boston Red Sox]] vs. [[Chicago Cubs]]). These held action photos to further identify them as being collectible baseball cards.

There is a significant collectors market for older cards, which are broken down into several eras (all years are approximate) as printing technology evolved:
*1941-1958—Black and white cards printed on heavy cardboard, with die-cut center opening so the card can be put on a cardboard block to hold it steady beneath the spinner on the game board. Most if not all years' cards in this era have solid dark green backs.
*1959-1962—Old time players' cards are printed in red instead of black. The cardboard is lighter weight.
*1962-1967—Current players are on multicolored cards with blue-gray backgrounds and with key colors indicating [[American League|American]] or [[National League]]. Old time players' cards have red backgrounds. Wooden baserunner pegs were also replaced with plastic pegs at this time.
*1968-1988—The game board is redesigned and the cardboard block to hold the cards beneath the spinner is replaced with a plastic holder on which the spinner rests; the card is inserted in the top of the holder and is centered beneath the spinner. This eliminated the need for the die-cut hole in the middle of the card, making them less likely to tear. Some die-hard players, accustomed to holding the cards through the center hole, manually cut holes in the new cards.
*1989-1991, 1993, 2003-2004—Player photographs are added to the cards, in part to try to increase their collector value.

==Variants==
The published 1941 game was considered only a first draft. In 1975, Cadaco did try a version with 8 categories instead of 14, but the cards were already collected by dedicated players and the re-design was abandoned by Cadaco. Despite the increases in complexity, the game was intended for boys, not adults.

The '''Bell Sensplex''' is a four-pad ice facility, located in the city of [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. It is the primary practice facility of the [[Ottawa Senators]] [[National Hockey League|NHL]] team. In a partnership with the [[City of Ottawa]], it is also used for minor hockey and hosts the annual [[Bell Capital Cup]] [[ice hockey]] tournament. The Sensplex is located at 1565 Maple Grove Road in the Kanata district of Ottawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bellsensplex.ca/location.aro |title=Location &amp; Directions |accessdate=2008-03-25 |publisher=www.bellsensplex.ca |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041214091451/http://www.bellsensplex.ca/location.aro |archivedate=December 14, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the home arena for the [[Ottawa Senators (CWHL)|Ottawa Senators]] of the [[Canadian Women's Hockey League]].

==History==
The Senators, in a partnership with the [[City of Ottawa]], built the Bell Sensplex, for community and team use at a cost of $25.6 million. The facility contains three NHL-sized ice rinks, one Olympic-size ice rink and an indoor fieldhouse in its {{Convert|180000|ft2|m2}} building. The City of Ottawa provided $1.4 million of the cost to facilitate the construction. The Sensplex ultimately used only $800,000 of the City's funds.&lt;ref name="citizen-cite"&gt;{{cite news |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=September 17, 2009 |title=Sensplex to city: keep the change |url=https://ottawacitizen.com/sports/Sensplex+city+keep+change/2004622/story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sensplex opened in December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bellsensplex.ca/news/nr041212.aro |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041229213355/http://www.bellsensplex.ca/news/nr041212.aro |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 29, 2004 |title=BELL SENSPLEX OFFICIALLY OPENS IN HOCKEY COUNTRY |publisher=www.bellsensplex.ca |date=December 12, 2004 |accessdate=2008-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
It is used for Senators team practices, minor hockey and short track speed skating. The City of Ottawa buys 2,400 hours of ice time for public use annually.&lt;ref name="citizen-cite"/&gt; The facility is the main arena for the annual [[Bell Capital Cup]], open to ''Atom'' (9-11) and ''Pee-Wee'' (11-13) age group teams, held between Christmas Day and New Year's. The tournament attracts over 500 teams annually and bills itself as "the world's largest hockey tournament."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oihf.net/general_info.aro |title=Bell Capital Cup information |accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Bend School Board established a building committee to develop plans for a new high school in 1923, they followed recommendations from the building committee and accepted the Bend Amateur Athletic Club building from the Bend Holding Company to use as the high school's [[gym]]nasium.&lt;ref name="NR2"&gt;[http://www.ci.bend.or.us/depts/community_development/planning_division/docs/historic/Bend_High_School.pdf "Bend High School"], ''National Register of Historic Places Registration Form'', National Park Service, United States Department of Interior, Deschutes County, Oregon, July 23, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The school would become [[Old Bend High School]] (also listed on the NRHP).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27354">The '''[[FIDE Grand Prix|FIDE Women's Grand Prix]] 2015–16''' was a series of five [[chess]] tournaments exclusively for women, which determined one player to play in the [[Women's World Chess Championship Match 2018]], a 10-game match against the knockout world champion.

This was the fourth cycle of the tournament series. Top ranked player was [[Hou Yifan]], who won the previous three editions of the Grand Prix, but had withdrawn participation after playing in the first tournament. The overall Grand Prix was won by Chinese player [[Ju Wenjun]], who overtok [[Koneru Humpy]] at the last tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/9904-ju-wenjun-is-triumphant-in-khanty-mansiysk.html |title=Ju Wenjun is triumphant in Khanty-Mansiysk  |publisher=FIDE |publication-date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koneru Humpy thereby finished overall runner-up for the fourth time.

==Format==
Originally the Grand Prix was scheduled as a 4-event tour.&lt;ref name=announce /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=137&amp;view=article Regulations] (FIDE)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fide_ann&gt;[https://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/8981-fide-womens-grand-prix-2015-2016.html Announcement] (FIDE)&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the March 2016 FIDE Presidential Board meeting, a fifth event was then added, which replaced the Women's Knockout championship.&lt;ref name=fide_pb&gt;[https://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/9526-fide-presidential-board-meeting-held-in-moscow.html FIDE Presidential Board Meeting] (March 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen women were selected to compete in these tournaments,&lt;ref name=fide_ann /&gt; though with the expansion the total became twenty, along with extras to replace the withdrawn [[Hou Yifan]]. Each player agrees to a contract to participate in exactly three of these tournaments.  The players must rank their preference of tournaments once the final list of host cities is announced and the dates are allocated to each host city.

Each tournament is a 12-player, single [[round-robin tournament]]. In each round players score 1 point for a win, ½ point for a [[draw (chess)|draw]] and 0 for a loss. Grand Prix points were then allocated according to each player's standing in the tournament: 160 grand prix points for first place, 130 for second place, 110 for third place, and then 90 down to 10 points by increments of 10. In case of a tie in points the Grand Prix points are shared evenly by the tied players.

Players only count their three best tournament results. The player with the most Grand Prix points is the winner. FIDE reserved the right to change locations and dates and increase the tournaments to six (6) and players to eighteen (18), each player in four (4) tournaments.&lt;ref name="regulations"&gt;[https://www.fide.com/FIDE/handbook/regulations_WGP_2015_16.pdf Regulations] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually they expanded the Grand Prix but not in the contractual manner specified, deciding to add a fifth stop at their Moscow presidential meeting (March 2016), with approximately 20 players in all taking part, keeping 3 tournaments per player.&lt;ref name=fide_pb /&gt;

In May, 2016, Hou Yifan announced that she was dropping out of the Women's Grand Prix because she disagrees with the process of determining the Women's World Champion. FIDE has kept every second Women’s World Championship as a 64-player knockout tournament since 2010, which Hou characterized as a "lottery." The winner of the knockout is the Women's World Champion, and then plays the overall winner of the Grand Prix. Hou believes that as the current World Champion she should defend her title against a challenger (as the Men's World Championship is decided), rather than playing in qualifying tournaments and then having to play against the winner of the knockout tournament. Alternatively, under the current setup, if she wins both the knockout tournament and the Grand Prix, she would have to play the woman who took second place in the Grand Prix for the title. In the 2013-2014 cycle, Hou was unable to play in the knockout tournament because she had already committed to play in another venue when the knockout tournament was scheduled; therefore, she lost her title to Mariya Muzychuk temporarily and regained it in a match in 2016 (delayed from 2015). Hou also said she will not be playing in the knockout tournament in this cycle.&lt;ref name=Houdropout&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Hou Yifan has dropped out of the cycle|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/why-hou-yifan-has-dropped-out-of-the-cycle|website=chessbase.com|accessdate=6 June 2016|date=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tiebreaks==
With the objective of determining a clear, single winner to play in the Challenger Match and in the case of the top two or more players having equal cumulative points, the following criteria (in descending order) will be utilized to decide the overall winner:
# Number of actual game result points scored in the three tournaments.
# Number of first places (in case of a tie – points given accordingly).
# Number of second places (in case of a tie – points given accordingly).
# Number of wins.
# Drawing of lots.

==Schedule==
Like the men's Grand Prix, the number of tournaments were reduced, here from six to five.&lt;ref name=announce/&gt;

'''Francs Stadium''' was the main stadium for [[Association football|football]] in the City of [[Colmar]] until 2000.

==  History  ==
It hosted the home games of [[SR Colmar]] since 24 June 1928,  the date of inauguration of the enclosure. This formerly fallow land had been leased by the club in 1926.  The stadium emerged after more than a year of refurbishments carried out mainly by members of the sports club Colmar.

The record attendance is 11,990 spectators recorded 1948-1949 against the [[RC Strasbourg Alsace|RC Strasbourg]] during their only season in [[Ligue 1|Division 1]] for [[SR Colmar]].

The stadium was named for a time the "Stade Joseph Lehmann" in memory of the former president of the club. The funeral of [[:fr:Joseph Lehmann (1886-1949)|Joseph Lehmann]] happened on the lawn of the stadium 17 May 1949.  During the Second World War and the annexation to Germany, the stadium was renamed "Frankenweg Stadion".

During the 2000s, a new stadium was built in the northeast of the city: the [[:fr:Colmar Stadium|Colmar Stadium]].  It is now the main stadium of the city of Colmar and hosts the team matches of [[SR Colmar]] as well as many gala matches organized by the club.

'''Futsal Association of India''' (FAI) is an organisation which has been developing the game of [[futsal]] ({{IPA-pt|futˈsaw}}) in [[India]] since 2008. 

[[Namdev Shirgaonkar]], founder President of FAI, introduced this game in [[India]] in 2007. Since then this game has emerged as new and fast form of [[football]] in India. FAI has been developing futsal through various District, State and National Championships. FAI organised its 1st Youth Futsal Championship in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Futsal scores in popularity|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/futsal-scores-in-popularity/article3070640.ece|website=The Hindu|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=21 September 2014|date=5 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

FAI is affiliated with [[Asociación Mundial de Fútbol de Salón]] (AMF) since 2011 &amp; is also a founder member of the [[Confederation of Asian Futsal]] (CAFS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Confederation of Asian Futsal|url=http://www.cafs.asia/|website=Confederation of Asian Futsal|publisher=Confederation of Asian Futsal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40607">In [[team sport]]s, the term '''home advantage''' &amp;ndash; also called '''home ground, home field, home-field advantage, home court, home-court advantage, defender's advantage''' or '''home-ice advantage''' &amp;ndash; describes the benefit that the [[home (sports)|home team]] is said to gain over the [[road (sports)|visiting team]]. This  benefit has been attributed to psychological effects supporting fans have on the competitors or referees; to psychological or physiological advantages of playing near home in familiar situations; to the disadvantages away teams suffer from changing time zones or climates, or from the rigors of travel; and, in some sports, to specific rules that favor the home team directly or indirectly.  In [[baseball]], in particular, the difference may also be the result of the home team having been assembled to take advantage of the idiosyncrasies of the home [[ballpark]], such as the distances to the outfield walls; most other sports are played in standardized venues.

The term is also widely used in "best-of" [[playoff format]]s (e.g., best-of-seven) as being given to the team that is scheduled to play one more game at home than their opponent if all necessary games are played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/calcio_numeri/tommatre/tommatre/tommatre.html|title=Il fattore campo si prende la rivincita [Home advantage takes revenge]|website=repubblica.it|date=September 19, 2001|language=italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many sports, such designations may also apply to games played at a neutral site; as the rules of various sports make different provisions for home and visiting teams. In [[baseball]], for instance, the team designated the home team bats second in each inning, whereas the "visiting" team bats first.

==Advantages==
In most team sports, the home or hosting team is considered to have a significant advantage over the visitors.  Due to this, many important games (such as playoff or elimination matches) in many sports have special rules for determining what match is played where.   In [[association football]], [[Two-legged tie|matches with two legs]], one game played in each team's "home", are common.  It is also common to hold important games at a neutral site, such as the [[Super Bowl]], in which the location is determined years in advance. In many team sports in [[North America]] (including [[baseball]], [[basketball]], and [[ice hockey]]), playoff series are often held with a nearly equal number of games at each team's site.  However, as it is usually beneficial to have an odd number of matches in a series (to prevent ties), the final home game is often awarded to the team that had the most success over the regular season.

An example is [[UEFA Champions League]] and [[UEFA Europa League]] home and away legs, with weaker teams often beating the favourites when playing at home. The [[Football World Cup|World Cup]] victories of [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] (1930), [[Italy national football team|Italy]] (1934), [[England national football team|England]] (1966), [[Germany national football team|Germany]] (1974), [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] (1978) and [[France national football team|France]] (1998) are all in part attributed to the fact that the World Cup was held in the winner's country. A 2006 study by ''[[The Times]]'' found that in the [[Premier League|English Premiership]], a home team can be expected to score 37.29% more goals than the away team, though this changes depending on the quality of the teams involved.  Others have suggested that the increase in British medals during the 2012 Olympics may have been impacted by home court advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Christensen |first=Kristen |title="Home Field Advantage" at London Olympics |url=http://www.berkshirepublishing.com/blog/?p=2733 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130118105357/http://www.berkshirepublishing.com/blog/?p=2733 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 18, 2013 |publisher=Berkshire Publishining |accessdate=August 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  (However, having home court did not help Canada at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, the only Summer Games at which the hosting country failed to win a single gold medal.)

The strength of the home advantage varies for different sports, regions, seasons, and divisions. For all sports, it seems to be strongest in the early period after the creation of a new league. The effect seems to have become somewhat weaker in some sports in recent decades.&lt;ref name=AEP&gt;Diana Widermann, Robert A. Barton, and Russel A. Hill. Evolutionary perspectives on sport and competition. In {{Cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S. C. | editor1-last = Roberts | doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586073.001.0001 | editor1-first = S. Craig | title = Applied Evolutionary Psychology | year = 2011 | publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 9780199586073 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adams &amp; Kupper (1994)]] described home-field advantage as an expertise deficiency.  They demonstrated that, in theory and in practice, home-field advantage decreases as superiority of performance increases.  They also showed that home-field advantage is not applicable for no-hit major league baseball games for pitchers who either replicated performance by winning two or more no-hitters or amassed a large number of career wins.  Their general finding was that home-field advantage is a metric for the inability to maintain performance independent of environment and that this metric is inversely related to variables of expertise.{{clarify|date=May 2015}}

In recognition of the difficulty in winning away matches, cup competitions in [[association football]] often invoke the [[away goals rule]]. Away goals can also sometimes be used to separate teams level on points and goal difference in league competitions.

===Causes===
====Factors related to the location and the venue====
There are many causes that attribute to home advantage, such as crowd involvement, travel considerations, and environmental factors. The most commonly cited factors of home advantage are usually factors which are difficult to measure and so even their existence is debated. Most of these are psychological in nature: the home teams are familiar with the playing venue; they can lodge in their homes, rather than in a hotel, and so have less far to travel before the game; and they have the psychological support of the home fans.

Other factors, however, are easier to detect and can have noticeable effects on the outcome of the game. In [[American football]], for instance, the crowd often makes as much noise as it can when the visiting team is about to run a play. That can make it very difficult for the visiting team's [[quarterback]] to call [[Quarterback#Special tactics|audible]] play changes, or for any player to hear the [[snap count]]. In contrast, the crowd is often quiet while the home team is on offense, and that enables the quarterback to use the hard count intended to draw the defense [[Offside (American football)|offsides]] as the defense can hear the hard count. In [[basketball]], when a visiting player is making a [[free throw]], home fans behind the [[backboard (basketball)|backboard]] typically wave their arms or other objects in an attempt to break the visiting player's focus on making the shot. Environmental factors such as weather and altitude are easy to measure, yet their effects are debatable, as both teams have to play in the same conditions; but the home team may be more acclimated to local conditions with difficult environments, such as extremely warm or cold weather, or high altitude (such as the case of [[Sports in Denver|Denver teams]], as well as the [[Mexico national football team]], many of whose home matches are played in [[Mexico City]]).

The stadium or arena will typically be filled with home [[fan (person)|supporters]], who are sometimes described as being as valuable as an extra player for the home team. The home fans can sometimes create a psychological lift by cheering loudly for their team when good things happen in the game. The home crowd can also intimidate visiting players by [[booing]], [[whistling]], or [[Heckler|heckling]]. Generally the home fans vastly outnumber the visiting team's supporters. While some visiting fans may travel to attend the game, home team fans will generally have better access to tickets and easier transport to the event, thus in most cases they outnumber the visitors' fans (although in [[local derby|local derbies]] and [[crosstown rivalry|crosstown rivalries]] this may not always be the case). In some sports, such as [[association football]], sections of the stadium will be reserved for supporters of one team or the other (to prevent fan violence) but the home team's fans will have the bulk of the seating available to them. In addition, stadium/arena [[laser lighting display|light shows]], [[sound effects]], [[fireworks]], [[cheerleaders]], and other means to enliven the crowd will be in support of the home team. [[Sports announcer|Stadium announcers]] in many sports will emphasize the home team's goals and lineup to excite the crowd.

Ryan Boyko, a research assistant in the Department of Psychology in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at [[Harvard University]], studied 5,000 [[Premier League|English Premier League]] games from 1992 to 2006, to discern any officiating bias and the influence of home crowds. The data was published in the ''Journal of Sports Sciences'' and suggested that for every additional 10,000 people attending, home team advantage increased by 0.1 goals. Additionally, his study proved what many football fans already suspect: that home teams are likely to be awarded more [[Penalty kicks (soccer)|penalty kicks]], but crucially, this is more likely with inexperienced [[referees]]. So, consideration of referee profiles should clearly be a refinement for home field advantage statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6629397.stm|accessdate=2007-05-06|title=Study Reveals Referees' Home Bias|publisher=BBC|author=BBC | date=2007-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, home players can be accustomed to peculiar environmental conditions of their home area. The city of [[Denver]], being a mile (1609&amp;nbsp;m) above sea level, has thinner air, enough so that it affects the stamina of athletes whose bodies are not used to it. Although [[baseball]] is less [[aerobic exercise|aerobically]] demanding than many other sports, high altitude affects that sport's game play in several important ways. Denver's combination of altitude and a [[semi-arid climate]] (the city averages only about 16 in/400&amp;nbsp;mm precipitation annually) allows [[Batted ball|fly balls]] to travel about 10% farther than at sea level, and also slightly reduces the ability of a [[pitcher]] to throw an effective [[breaking ball]]. The low humidity also causes baseballs to dry out, making it harder for pitchers to grip them and further reducing their ability to throw breaking balls. Consequently,{{cn|date=May 2018}} the [[Colorado Rockies]] have a very large home advantage, with a 30% better home than away record. This anomaly has been countered with Colorado's innovative use of [[humidor]]s to keep the baseballs from drying out. [http://www.denverpost.com/rockies/ci_3961497] Denver's altitude advantage has also come into play in [[gridiron football]]; the longest [[field goal (football)|field goal]] in [[National Football League]] history took place in Denver, as did the longest recorded [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]]. The national [[association football]] team of [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] also enjoys the advantage of playing at high altitude: at home during [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] [[FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifiers]] at the even more extreme 3,600&amp;nbsp;m (11,800&amp;nbsp;ft) altitude of [[La Paz]] they have even been known to beat [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], a team regularly ranked number one in the [[FIFA World Rankings]]. More recently, Bolivia beat [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], who were ranked sixth in the world, 6–1 on April 1, 2009, Argentina's heaviest defeat since 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Dan|last= Baynes|title= Argentina Loses 6-1 to Bolivia in Biggest Soccer Loss Since ’58|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&amp;sid=arDYSDfu9SEw&amp;refer=latin_america|date= 2 April 2009|quote=Striker [[Joaquin Botero]] scored three goals in La Paz yesterday as Argentina slumped to its heaviest defeat since losing by the same score to [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] at the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]] in Sweden.|accessdate= 14 June 2010|work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[cricket]], the condition of the [[cricket pitch|pitch]] and the behaviour of the ball when it bounces off the pitch varies significantly in different parts of the world, and consequently the players on the visiting team must adjust to the ball behaving in an unfamiliar way to be successful on foreign surfaces; additionally, the home team has the right to adjust the preparation of its pitches in a manner which specifically exacerbates its own strengths or its opponent's weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/gametheory/2012/12/home-advantage-cricket|title=Pitch perfect|date=4 December 2012|accessdate=12 July 2015|publisher=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The weather can also play a major factor. For example, the February average temperature minimum in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]] is {{convert|50|F|C}}, while the average at the same time in [[Kazan]], [[Russia]] is {{convert|10|F|C}}, with snow being common. This means that when [[FC Rubin Kazan|Rubin Kazan]] played at home to [[Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C.|Hapoel Tel Aviv]] in the [[2009-10 UEFA Europa League]], Hapoel needed to acclimatize and were therefore at a disadvantage. Hapoel duly lost the match 3-0. This advantage, however, can also be a disadvantage to the home team, as weather conditions can impede the home team as much as the visitors: the [[Buffalo Bills]], whose home stadium ([[New Era Field]]) is subject to high and unpredictable winds and [[lake-effect snow]] in the late fall and early winter, regularly suffer large numbers of injuries late in the season.

Sometimes the unique attributes of a stadium create a home-field advantage. The unique off-white [[Teflon]]-coated roof of the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] trapped and reflected noise to such an extent that it was distracting or even harmful. This, combined with the color of the roof, caused opposing baseball players to commit more errors in the Dome than in other ballparks. While this is no longer an issue for opponents of the [[Minnesota Twins]] with that team's 2010 move to the open-air [[Target Field]], it remained important to the many college baseball teams that played games in the Dome until its late 2013 closing. The [[parquet]] floor at the [[Boston Celtics]]' former home of [[Boston Garden]] contained many defects, which were said to give the Celtics, who were more likely to be familiar with the playing surface, an advantage.  During the [[1985–86 Boston Celtics season|1985–1986 season]], the [[Larry Bird]]-led Celtics posted a home court record of 40-1; this record still stands in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. [[Memorial Gymnasium (Vanderbilt University)|Memorial Gymnasium]], the venue for [[Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball|men's]] and [[Vanderbilt Commodores women's basketball|women's]] basketball at [[Vanderbilt University]], was built in 1952 with the team benches at the ends of the court instead of along one of the sidelines, a setup that was not unusual at the time. However, the configuration is now unique in U.S. major-college sports, and has been said to give Vandy an edge because opposing coaches are not used to directing their teams from the baseline. [[Cherry Hill Arena]], a [[New Jersey]]-based arena in the southern suburbs of [[Philadelphia]], had a number of idiosyncrasies that its home teams used to their advantage but earned the arena an extremely poor reputation, including a slanted ice surface that forced opponents to skate the majority of the game uphill and lack of showers for the visiting team.

''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', in a 17 January 2011 article, reported that home crowds, rigor of travel for visiting teams, scheduling, and unique home field characteristics, ''were not'' factors in giving home teams an advantage.  The journal concluded that it was favorable treatment by game officials and referees that conferred advantages on home teams.  They stated that sports officials are unwittingly and psychologically influenced by home crowds and the influence is significant enough to effect the outcomes of sporting events in favor of the home team.&lt;ref&gt;Moskowitz, Tobias J., and L. Jon Wertheim, "What's Really Behind Home Field Advantage", ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', 17 January 2011, pp. 65–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research has found that crowd support, travel fatigue, geographical distance, pitch familiarity, and referee bias do not have a strong effect when each factor is considered alone suggesting that it is the combination of several different factors that creates the overall home advantage effect. An [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation for the home advantage effect refers to observed behavioral and physiological responses in animals when they are defending their [[Territory (animal)|home territory]] against intruders. This causes a rise in aggression and [[testosterone]] levels in the defenders. A similar effect has been observed in football with testosterone levels being significantly higher in home games than in away games. Goalkeepers, the last line of defense, have particularly strong testosterone changes when playing against a bitter rival as compared to a training season. How testosterone may influence results is unclear but may include cognitive effects such as motivation and physiological effects such as reaction time.&lt;ref name=AEP/&gt;

An extreme example of home advantage was the [[2013 Nigeria Premier League]]; each of the 20 teams lost at most 3 of 19 home matches and won at most 3 of 19 away matches. [[Paul Doyle (journalist)|Paul Doyle]] ascribed this to visiting teams' facing "violent crowds, questionable refereeing and [...] [a]rriving just before kick-off after long road trips, often on hazardous surfaces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/oct/29/nigeria-toughest-league-win-away|title=Why is Nigeria the world's toughest league in which to get an away win?|last=Doyle|first=Paul|date=29 October 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=12 October 2016|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Factors related to the game rules====
In [[ice hockey]], there are at least three distinct rule-related advantages for the home team. The first is referred to as "last change", where during stoppages of play, the home team is allowed to make player substitutions after the visiting team does.  This allows the home team to obtain favorable player matchups. This rule makes the home team designation important even in games played on neutral ice. Traditionally, the second advantage was that when lining up for the [[face-off]], the away team's centre always had to place his stick on the ice before the centre of the home team. However, in both the NHL and international rule sets, this now applies only for face-offs at the centre-ice spot; when a face-off takes place anywhere else on the ice, the defending centre has to place his stick first. The centre who is allowed to place his stick last gains the ability to time the face-off better and gives him greater odds of winning it. The third advantage is that the home team has the benefit of choosing whether to take the first or second attempt in a shootout.

In [[baseball]], the home team gets to bat last in each inning. If the game goes into extra innings, this can yield very real advantages when deciding strategies regarding base-stealing and [[sacrifice bunt|sacrifice hits]].{{cn|date=May 2018}} In addition, in [[Major League Baseball]], the home league's rules concerning the [[designated hitter]] (DH) are followed during [[interleague play|interleague]] games, including the [[World Series]]. This puts AL teams at a disadvantage when they play in NL parks, as AL pitchers are typically not used to having to bat. NL teams at AL parks are at a disadvantage because a player who does not play often will have to bat an entire game, usually on consecutive nights. The NL team's DH is a [[pinch-hitter]] who bats perhaps once every two or three games during the season, or alternates in a platoon system with other players (such as a catcher who does not start because the starting pitcher uses the other catcher), while the AL team's DH bats three or more times a game throughout the season.

In baseball, there is always a psychological home advantage when the game is tied or close in the [[inning (baseball)|9th]] or in [[extra innings]].{{cn|date=May 2018}} The visiting team, if they are leading after batting in their half of the inning (the top), must face and record three outs against the home team in order to finish off and win the game. But the home team, upon scoring the go-ahead run in the bottom of the 9th or an extra inning, wins in [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]] without having to take the field defensively following their period at bat. If the home team is in the lead following the top of the 9th, the game ends at this point, and the bottom of the 9th is not played at all. There is no clear-cut, ''physical'' advantage because both teams are given the same number of opportunities (i.e. innings). The advantage is knowing how well one must perform in the last inning, if at all.

For games at home, the hosting team will have the advantage of playing with their first choice uniform/kit, rather than their alternate colors. A team's identity is often partly or mostly based on its home colors (for example, the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] of New Zealand).  In Major League Baseball, by tradition a team's home uniform has the team name on it (i.e. "Twins", "Mets", "Braves") and is typically white in color, while its away uniform has the name of its home city, state or region on it ("Minnesota", "New York", "Atlanta") and is grey or is the "dark" jersey (features the team's colors), although there are exceptions.

A rule in American high school football (except Massachusetts and Texas, which play by NCAA rules) requiring the home team to wear dark jerseys and the visiting team to wear white jerseys may work as a ''disadvantage ''to the home team in hot-weather games.

=== Measuring and comparing of home-field advantage ===
Measuring the home-field advantage of a team (in a league with balanced schedule) requires to determine number of opponents for which the result at home-field was better (&lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt;), same (&lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt;), and worse (&lt;math&gt;k_{-1}&lt;/math&gt;). Goals scored and conceded – in so called ''combined measure of home team advantage'' – are used to determine which results are better, same, and which are worse. Given two results between teams &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;h_{T_1}:a_{T_2}&lt;/math&gt; played at &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;'s field and &lt;math&gt;h_{T_2}:a_{T_1}&lt;/math&gt;played at &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt;'s field, we can compute differences in scores (e.g. from &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;'s point of view): &lt;math&gt;d_{h,T_1}=h_{T_1}-a_{T_2}&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;d_{a,T_1}=a_{T_1}-h_{T_2}&lt;/math&gt;. Team &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; played better at home field if &lt;math&gt;d_{h,T_1}&gt;d_{a,T_1}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; played better at away field if &lt;math&gt;d_{h,T_1}&lt;d_{a,T_1}&lt;/math&gt; (for example, if Arsenal won 3–1 at home against Chelsea, i.e. &lt;math&gt;d_{h,Arsenal}=2&lt;/math&gt;, and Arsenal won 3–0 at Chelsea, i.e. &lt;math&gt;d_{a,Arsenal}=3&lt;/math&gt;, then the result for Arsenal at home was worse). Same approach has to be used for all opponents in one season to obtain &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;k_{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Values of &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;k_{-1}&lt;/math&gt; are used to estimate probabilities as &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}_r=\frac{k_r+1}{K+3}, r=-1,0,1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is total number of opponents in a league (this is [[Bayes estimator|Bayesian estimator]]). To test hypothesis that home-field advantage is [[statistically significant]] we can compute &lt;math&gt;P(p_1&gt;p_{-1})=1-I_{1/2}(k_1+1,k_{-1}+1)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I_{1/2}()&lt;/math&gt; is [[incomplete gamma function]]. For example, Newcastle in [[2015–16 Premier League|2015/2016 English Premier League]] season recorded better result at home field for 13 opponents, same result with 4 opponents, and worse result for two opponents; therefore &lt;math&gt;P(p_1&gt;p_{-1})=1-I_{1/2}(14,3)=0.998&lt;/math&gt; and hypothesis about home team advantage can be accepted. This procedure was introduced and applied by Marek and Vávra (2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marek|first1=Patrice|last2=Vávra|first2=František|title=Home Team Advantage in English Premier League|journal=MathSport International 2017 Conference Proceedings|date=2017|pages=244-254|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318588534_Home_Team_Advantage_in_English_Premier_League}}&lt;/ref&gt; on English Premier League seasons 1992/1993 – 2015/2016.

Marek and Vávra (2018)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marek|first=Patrice|last2=Vávra|first2=František|date=March 2018|title=Comparison of Home Team Advantage in English and Spanish Football Leagues|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323858614_Comparison_of_Home_Team_Advantage_in_English_and_Spanish_Football_Leagues|journal=Proceedings of 17th Conference on Applied Mathematics APLIMAT 2018|volume=|pages=724–732|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; described procedure which allows to use observed counts of combined measure of home team advantage (&lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;k_{-1}&lt;/math&gt;) in two leagues to be compared by the ''test for homogeneity of parallel samples'' (for the test see Rao (2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Linear Statistical Inference and its Applications|last=Rao|first=C. R.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2002|isbn=0-471-21875-8|location=|pages=398–402}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The second proposed approach is based  on distance between estimated probability description of home team advantage in two leagues ( &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}_r=\frac{k_r}{K}, r=-1,0,1&lt;/math&gt;) which can be measured by Jeffrey divergence (a symmetric version of [[Kullback-Leibler distance|Kulback-Leibler distance]]). They tested five top level English football leagues and two top level Spanish leagues between 2007/2008 and 2016/2017 season. The main result is that home team advantage in Spain is stronger. Spanish [[La Liga]] has the strongest home team advantage and [[EFL League Two|English football league two]] has the lowest home team advantage among analysed leagues.

==Gaining or losing home-field advantage==
During the regular season for a sport, in the interest of fairness, schedulers try to ensure that each team plays an equal number of home and away games. Thus, having home-field advantage for any particular regular-season game is largely due to random chance. (This is only true for fully organized leagues with structured schedules; for a counterexample, [[college football]] schedules often have an imbalance in which the most successful and largest teams can negotiate more home appearances than [[mid-major]]s, a situation that was also prevalent in the early, disorganized years of the National Football League).

However, in the [[playoffs]], home advantage is usually given to the team with the higher seed (which may or may not have the better record), as is case in the [[NFL playoffs|NFL]], [[Major League Baseball postseason|MLB]], and [[Stanley Cup playoffs|NHL playoffs]]. One exception to this was MLB's [[World Series]], which between 2003 and 2016, awarded home-field advantage to the team representing the league which won the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] that year, to help raise interest in the All-Star Game after a [[2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|tie in 2002]] (before 2003, home-field advantage alternated each year between the [[National League]] and the [[American League]]). The [[NBA playoffs|NBA]] is the only league that has home-court advantage based solely on which team has the best record (using various tiebreakers to settle the question should the teams finish with identical records). 

Rugby union's [[European Rugby Champions Cup]] also uses a seeding system to determine home advantage in the quarterfinals (though not in the semifinals, where the nominal "home" teams&lt;ref&gt;Champions Cup rules regarding semi final venues, which were taken directly from those of the competition's predecessor, the [[Heineken Cup]], are:
*The venue cannot be a team's normal home ground.
*It must have a capacity of at least 20,000.
*It must be held in the same country as the team drawn as "home". However, exceptions have been allowed. Most notably, [[Top 14|French]] club [[Biarritz Olympique]], located less than {{convert|20|km|mi|0}} from the [[Spain|Spanish]] border, have been allowed to take semifinals across the border to [[Estadio Anoeta]] in [[San Sebastián|Donostia-San Sebastián]], which is far closer to Biarritz than any acceptable ground in France.&lt;/ref&gt; are determined by a blind draw).

In many sports, playoffs consist of a 'series' of games played between two teams. These series are usually a best-of-5 or best-of-7 format, where the first team to win 3 or 4 games, respectively, wins the playoff. Since these best-of series always involve an odd number of games, it is impossible to guarantee that an equal number of games will be played at each team's home venue. As a result, one team must be scheduled to have one more home game than the other. This team is said to have home-field advantage for that playoff series.

During the course of these playoff series, however, sports announcers or columnists will sometimes mention a team "gaining" or "losing" home-field advantage. This can happen after a visiting team has just won a game in the series. In playoff series format, the home-field advantage is said to exist for whichever team would win the series ''if'' all remaining games in the series are won by the home team ''for that game''.  Therefore, it is possible for a visiting team to win a game and, hence, gain home-field advantage.  This is somewhat similar to the concept of losing serve in [[tennis]].

As an example, suppose that the [[San Francisco Giants]] and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] are about to play a best-of-seven series against each other. Four games will be played in San Francisco, while three will be played in Los Angeles.  If the home team were to win each game, then the Giants would win four games, the Dodgers would win three games, and the Giants would win the series, so we say that San Francisco has the home-field advantage. However, suppose that the first game is played at the Giants' park and the visiting Dodgers win. Los Angeles now has one win, and there are three games remaining at each park. If the home team wins each of the remaining games, then the Dodgers will have won four games, while San Francisco will have won two (the last game at San Francisco would be omitted, as even if the Giants won, they'd still lose 4 games to 3). Since the Los Angeles Dodgers would win the series in such a scenario, it is said that they have taken home-field advantage away from the San Francisco Giants.

In some cup competitions, (for example the [[FA Cup]] in all rounds prior to the semi-final), home advantage is determined by a random drawing. However, if the initial match is drawn (tied), home advantage for the replay is given to the other team.

==Neutral venues==
For certain sporting events, home advantage may be removed by use of a neutral venue. This may be a national stadium that is not a home stadium to any club{{cn|date=February 2018}} (for example [[Wembley Stadium]] hosts the [[FA Cup]] Final and semi-finals). Alternatively the neutral venue may be the home stadium of another club, such as was used historically to stage FA Cup semi-finals.

If the venue is chosen before the start of the competition however, it is still possible for one team to gain home field advantage. For example, in the European Cup/UEFA Champions League, there have been four instances where a club has managed to reach the final hosted in its own stadium ([[1957 European Cup Final|1957]], [[1965 European Cup Final|1965]], [[1984 European Cup Final|1984]], and [[2012 UEFA Champions League Final|2012]]). Most recently [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] played (and lost) the 2012 final at their home stadium of [[Allianz Arena]], as it was chosen as the venue in January 2010. In the Champions League Final, however, if the "home" shirt colors of both teams conflict (e.g. both are red) then there is a draw which assigns one of the teams their "away" shirt. Not unlike the UEFA Champions League, the [[NFL]]'s [[Super Bowl]] is played in a venue chosen years in advance of the game. It is possible for a team to reach the Super Bowl when it is played in their home stadium; this has never happened in the history of the game, though two games ([[Super Bowl XIV|XIV]] in 1980 and [[Super Bowl XIX|XIX]] in 1985) were played in neutral stadiums in the market area of one of the participating teams. Tickets are allocated equally between both competing teams in the Final, even if one side happens to be the home team.

Neutral-venue matches may arise out of necessity. For example, on December 12, 2010, the roof of the [[Minnesota Vikings]]' stadium, the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] collapsed due to a snowstorm. The Vikings were supposed to play against the [[New York Giants]] at the stadium the next day. The game was moved to the [[Detroit Lions]]' stadium, [[Ford Field]]. The following week, the Vikings' ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game against the [[Chicago Bears]] was moved to the [[University of Minnesota]]'s [[TCF Bank Stadium]]. 

For the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons, the [[National Hockey League]] scheduled neutral site games. Each team played 41 home games, 41 road games, and 2 games at neutral sites (for a total of 84 games). The neutral site games were eliminated starting with the 1995–96 season, which reduced the regular season to 82 games per team.

A requirement to play home matches at a neutral venue has been used as a punishment by [[UEFA]] for teams whose fans cause disturbances at a previous match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.org/MultimediaFiles/Download/Regulations/uefaorg/UEFACompDisCases/02/37/00/86/2370086_DOWNLOAD.pdf#page=9 |format=PDF|title=Article 6 Disciplinary measures |quote=1. The following disciplinary measures may be imposed on member associations and clubs: [...] k. playing of a match in a third country|work=UEFA Disciplinary Regulations, Edition 2016|publisher=UEFA|pages=9 |nopp=Y|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, after the violent clashes after the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|Turkey-Switzerland game in 2005]], UEFA punished the Turkish team with playing the next six regular international home matches abroad. It is also required where one team's home location is in a war zone or at high risk of terrorism. In these cases the match is still treated as a "home" match for such purposes as implementing the [[away goals rule]]. For example, the Ukraine-Kosovo [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifier game for the 2018 World Championships]] was held in Krakow, Poland, because the Ukraine does not recognize Kosovo and does not admit Kosovar nationals to its territory.

==By competition==

===Baseball===
In the [[2018 Major League Baseball season|2018 Major League Baseball regular season]], the home team won 1,277 games (52.6%), and the away team won 1,149 games (47.4%). These totals include the season's two tiebreaker games, which are officially counted as part of the regular season, but do not include the six games played at neutral sites (though all of the neutral-site games had a designated home team).

* The team with the best overall record, the [[2018 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]], finished 108–54, going 57–24 [[Fenway Park|at home]] and 51–30 away. Of their wins, 52.8% were at home, and 55.6% of their losses were on the road.
* The team with the worst record, the [[2018 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]], went 47–115 (28–53 [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards|at home]], 19–62 away). Of their total wins, 59.6% were at home, and 53.9% of their losses were away.
* The largest differential between home and road records was that of the [[2018 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]], going 48–32 [[Citizens Bank Park|at home]], 31–50 away, and winning their [[2018 MLB Little League Classic|only neutral-site game]] as the designated home team. Exactly 60% of their wins were in their home park, and 61.0% of their losses were on the road.
* An especially anomalous home/away split was that of the [[2018 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]], whose 103–59 record was second-best in MLB. They were 11 games better on the road than at home (46–35 [[Minute Maid Park|home]], 57–24 away). Of their wins, 44.6% were at home, while 40.7% of their losses were away.

===Basketball===
In the [[2017–18 NBA season|2017–18 NBA regular season]], the home team won 712 games (58%), and the away team won 518 games (42%).

* The team with the best overall record, the [[2017–18 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]], finished 65–17, going 34–7 [[Toyota Center|at home]] and 31–10 away. In all, 52% of their wins were at home, and 59% of their losses were on the road.
* The [[2017–18 Toronto Raptors season|Toronto Raptors]] had the same home record as the Rockets, but went 25–16 away.  This meant that 58% of their wins were [[Scotiabank Arena|at home]], and nearly 70% of their losses were away.
* The season's largest differential between home and road records was that of the [[2017–18 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]]. Their [[AT&amp;T Center|home]] record was only one game worse than that of the Rockets and Raptors, at 33–8, but their road record was 14–27. The Spurs had 70% of their wins at home, and 77% of their losses were away.
* The only team with a better record on the road than at home was the [[2017–18 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]], who had the worst record in the league at 21–61. Their [[Talking Stick Resort Arena|home]] and road records were separated by only one game (10–31 home, 11–30 away).

===Association football===
In the [[2016–17 Premier League]], the home team won 187 matches (49%), the away team won 109 matches (29%), and teams drew in 84 matches (22%).

* [[Manchester City FC]] had 23 wins, 9 draws and 6 losses. They had 48% of their wins at home, and 93% of their losses away.
* [[Burnley FC]] had 11 wins, 7 draws and 20 losses. They had 91% of their wins at home, and 70% of their losses away.

'''Kickball''' (also known as '''soccer baseball''' in most of Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the10and3.com/this-is-how-canada-talks/|title=This is How Canada Talks - The 10 and 3|author=|date=24 August 2017|website=the10and3.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a game and [[sports league|league]] game, similar to [[baseball]], invented in the United States by Nicholas C Seuss. As in baseball, one team tries to score by having its players return a ball from home base to the field and then circle the bases; while the other team tries to stop them by tagging them "out" with the ball before they can return to the home base. Instead of hitting a small, hard ball with a bat, players kick an inflated rubber ball; this makes it more accessible to young children. As in baseball, teams alternate half-[[inning]]s. The team with the most runs after a predefined number of innings wins.

Kickball is a popular playground game and is typically played among young, school-age children.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The lack of both specialized equipment and highly skill-based positions (like [[pitcher]]) makes the game an accessible introduction to other sports. It is just as popular among adults, who are more commonly known to play similar games like [[softball]] and baseball.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

"The game seems to afford equal enjoyment to the children and it gives a better understanding of the national game (Baseball), and at the same time affords them an exercise that is not too violent and is full of fun."&lt;ref name=Play1920&gt;{{cite book

Around 1920–1921 "Kick Ball" was used by physical education teachers in public schools to teach young boys and girls the basics of baseball. Around this time, the ball that was used was a [[soccer ball]] or [[Volleyball (ball)|volleyball]]. It was played by ten to thirty players and the field included a "Neutral Zone": an area not to be entered until the ball has actually been kicked. There was no pitcher as the ball would be kicked from the home area, which was a 3&amp;nbsp;ft circle. The ball must pass beyond the 5 foot line. Base-runners could only advance one base on infield balls. Teams would switch sides only after all team members have kicked.&lt;ref name=MindAndBody&gt;{{cite book

During this time, it was played on the same field as baseball except that there was only one base corresponding to a [[baseball diamond]]'s 2nd base. Multiple players could be on base at a time, but all needed to get home before the last kicker kicked and the kicking order had retired.&lt;ref name=UniversityofStateofNY&gt;{{cite book

Published in April 1922, Daniel Chase; Supervisor of Physical Education for the New York State Department of Education, describes the earliest known account of adults playing kickball. This game took place at a conference of rural teachers in Mooers Forks, Clinton County, NY where Daniel was teaching games that the teachers could in turn teach to their pupils. They did not have a ball, so they made one out of an old stocking and some rags. The ball was about 7 to 8 inches long and tied off with an old shoelace. The construction of this makeshift ball was demonstrated to the rural teachers by Mr. Braddock Wells. The teachers were assigned numbers to create teams; odd numbers on one team and even numbers on the other. The team captains chose college names to represent each team name. The odds chose Yale &amp; the evens chose Princeton. The game of "Kick Baseball" was the last game they played at the conference to decide the championship for the day. 10 players were chosen for each team and the remaining were organized into a cheering section. Yale kicked first. On the field there was no pitcher, but an extra short-stop between first and second. Only three innings were completed in the heat that day, with Yale ending up as the victor winning 3 to 2.  The cheering sections showed great sportsmanship, applauding all good plays impartially.&lt;ref name=TheInstructor&gt;{{cite book

"Kick Ball" was promoted as an informal game for soldiers by the United States Department of the Army as early as 1943. In this variant of the game, all kicks had to be home runs, by beating the kicked ball back to home after consecutive passes to all basemen before throwing them out at home.&lt;ref name=InformalGamesForSoldiers&gt;{{cite book
|year       = 1943

|publisher  = U.S. government printing office
|pages      = 6
|accessdate = 2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Field==
The game is typically played on a [[softball]] diamond with an 8.5 inch to 16 inch diameter inflated rubber ball. As in baseball/softball, the game uses 3 bases, a pitcher's mound, and a home plate. Sometimes, in less formal games, the field is not bounded by a [[fence]] as in softball or baseball, but is open. This may result in informal rule changes to accommodate the field. Also it can be played on a rectangular blacktop area with chalk or paint outlines.

== Kicking strategy ==
The objective of kickball is to win by scoring more runs than the opposing team, thus kicking (or offensive) strategy is very important.  Assuming the rules allow bunting, one popular strategy for putting runners in scoring position is to place fast kickers, particularly those with the ability to bunt the ball in specific directions, near the top of the line-up.  Using this strategy, a team might put a fast player who can bunt down the third base line first in the line-up.  That player would bunt down the third base line, forcing either the third baseman, the pitcher, or the catcher to field the ball and throw the runner out at first base.  This is an optimal play with no outs and no players on base because throwing the ball from third to first base accurately is difficult.  A well-placed bunt on the ground also removes the opportunity for the defense to catch the ball in the air for an easy out and can create fielding confusion between the third baseman, the pitcher and the catcher.  The runner would then advance as far as their kick and the opposing team's defensive play allows him or her to advance. The next kicker would take stock of the base to which the first kicker has advanced and would try to kick the ball to a place that will maximize the first runner's ability to advance and the second kicker's ability to get on base safely.  For instance, if the first kicker is on first base, the second kicker might also kick down the third base line. This would give both kickers a good chance of safely advancing to the next base.

Ideally, a team would have runners on base and fewer than two outs once three to four kickers have kicked following this bunting strategy.  At that point in the line-up, it is advantageous to place one or two kickers who can kick the ball into the outfield.  The time it takes to field a ball from the outfield will ideally allow runners on base to score, even if the ball is caught in the outfield.

==Kickball in the United States==
In the past, kickball was mostly considered a child's game in the United States, although recently many US cities have created kickball leagues only for adults. Some US cities have multiple organized leagues for adults over 21 years of age.  It gained prominence in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{cite news

This page is a complete chronological listing of '''AFL Women's minor premiers'''. The [[AFL Women's]] (AFLW) is the elite national competition in [[women's Australian rules football]].

The team that finishes the home-and-away season on top of the premiership ladder is known as the "[[Minor premiership|minor premier]]". In the inaugural two AFL Women's seasons, the minor premier hosted the [[AFL Women's Grand Final]], as there was no finals series. This is unlike the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), where the [[AFL Grand Final]] is the culmination of a [[McIntyre Final Eight System|finals series]], and finishing on top of the ladder provides only minor benefits. No award has yet been given to the AFL Women's minor premier, and the main league award is the [[List of AFL Women's premiers|AFL Women's premiership]], which is awarded to the winner of the AFL Women's Grand Final.

As of 2018, one minor premier has won the AFL Women's premiership, and one has finished as runner-up. The AFL Women's began as an eight-team competition in 2017, with {{AFLW Gee}} and {{AFLW NM}} to join in 2019, and Gold Coast, Richmond, St Kilda and West Coast to join in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Black|first=Sarah|title=North and Geelong win AFLW expansion race|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2017-09-27/afl-set-to-reveal-new-womens-teams-for-2019|work=afl.com.au|date=27 September 2017|accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Malahide Cricket Club Ground''' or '''The Village''' is a cricket ground in [[Malahide]], [[Ireland]] situated in the Lady Acre field of [[Malahide Castle]] grounds. The ground is owned by the [[Malahide Cricket Club]].&lt;ref name="TheOwner"/&gt; The ground has been developed to a capacity of 11,500 making it [[Ireland]]'s biggest cricket venue and officially opened for international cricket in 2013. In November 2017, it was confirmed as the venue for Ireland's first [[Test cricket|Test match]], when they played [[Pakistani cricket team in Ireland in 2018|Pakistan in May 2018]].&lt;ref name="IrePak"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/42066074 |title=Malahide to host Ireland's first Test match when they play Pakistan in May |accessdate=21 November 2017 |work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International cricket==
In September 2013, [[International Cricket Council]] cleared the ground to host international cricket. The ground hosted its first international cricket match when home team [[Ireland cricket team|Ireland]] played against [[England cricket team|England]] with England winning by six wickets after captain [[Eoin Morgan]] hit 124 not out on what had been his home ground in his youth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/23926135 bbc]&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity was designed to be increased to 11500 using temporary grandstands and hospitality tents making it the biggest in Ireland with a record attendance for the Island of Ireland of over 10,000.&lt;ref name="claim11500"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Over10000"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstalk.com/Cricket-Ireland-to-get-largest-ever-attendance-tomorrow-|title=

The ground became Ireland's third venue for international cricket, the other two being [[Castle Avenue]] in [[Dublin]] and the Civil Service Cricket Club Ground at [[Stormont (cricket ground)|Stormont]].

Malahide was also confirmed as the stage for two [[Twenty20]] games against the touring [[South Africa A cricket team|South Africa A]] side in 2013.

It was selected as a venue to host matches in the [[2015 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier]] tournament.&lt;ref name="2015Fixtures"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/news/2015/media-releases/87946/icc-announces-schedule-of-icc-world-twenty20-qualifier-2015 |title=ICC announces schedule of ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier 2015 |accessdate=14 May 2015 |work=International Cricket Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''McDonald Gym''', built in 1958, is located on the campus of [[Lamar University]] in [[Beaumont, Texas]].  The building was completely renovated in 2006-07 as part of the $17,800,000 126,000 sq ft '''Sheila Umphrey Recreational Center''' project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sheila Umphrey Recreational Center|url=http://www.allco.com/projects/sheila-umphrey-recreational-center/|publisher=Allco, LLC|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The gym's seating capacity was reduced from 4,200 to 500 as part of the renovation.  ''McDonald Gym'' has been the home of the [[Lamar Cardinals#Volleyball|Lamar Lady Cardinals Volleyball Team]] since the renovation.  The facility was named after the fourth president of Lamar Dr. F.L. McDonald. (1952-1967)  The original construction cost estimate in 1957-1958 was $850,000.   Chambers Construction Company of Houston, Texas was the main construction contractor.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Leon Obenhaus|title=Work Begins on New Gym|url=https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth499342/m1/7/|accessdate=May 15, 2018|work=The Redbird (Beaumont, TX)|agency=University of North Texas Libraries, The Portal to Texas History|issue=Vol. 6, No. 16, Ed. 1|publisher=Crediting Lamar University|date=February 8, 1957|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Allco, LLC was the main contractor for the 2006-07 renovation.

==Facility Features==

In addition to the competition volleyball arena, the facility has the following:
*Coaches offices for Volleyball, Cross Country, Tennis and Track &amp; Field
*Separate team locker and shower facilities for each of the sports listed above.  Shower and locker facilities are also provided for visiting teams, coaches, and officials.
*Athletic Training Suite - athletic training staff offices, treatment and rehabilitation areas, and hydrotherapy room
*Student athlete lounge
*Student athlete study center - four private study rooms, computer lab with 14 workstations, and offices for two Athletic Academic Affairs coordinators.

==Prior to 2007==

As a 4,200 seat gymnasium, prior to the 2007 renovation project, the gym was home to both the [[Lamar Cardinals men's basketball]] team and Volleyball team from 1958 until the 1980-81 season.  It was also the home of the [[Lamar Lady Cardinals basketball]] team from 1969 to 1980-81.  Following the 1980-81 season, the basketball teams called the off-campus [[Beaumont Civic Center]] home from 1980-1984 until the construction of the 10,080 seat [[Montagne Center]] in 1984 gave the basketball teams a new on-campus home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamarcardinals.com/facilities/facilities-mcdonald-gym.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713182931/http://www.lamarcardinals.com/facilities/facilities-mcdonald-gym.html |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===220-65 Home Court Advantage Over the Years===

McDonald Gym was home of the men's basketball team for 23 years.  The Cardinals had a home record of 220-65 (.772) during that period.&lt;ref&gt;http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/lama/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/2011-12/misc_non_event/6-3-7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post Season Tournaments===
*[[1964 NCAA College Division Men's Basketball Tournament|1964 NCAA College Division Men's Basketball Tournament Southwest Regional Site]]

Over its life, the gym has also served as one of the venues for an annual YMBL South Texas Shootout high school basketball tournament held on the campus of Lamar University. In recent years, the [[Montagne Center]] also serves as another venue for the tournament.  The tournament began in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline - 1952|url=http://www.ymbl.org/timeline.aspx|website=ymbl.org|publisher=Young Men's Business League|accessdate=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YMBL Announces South Texas Shoot Out Basketball Tournament Dates|url=http://www.ymbl.org/press_release.aspx?p=8|publisher=Young Men's Business League|accessdate=December 29, 2014|date=November 9, 2011|quote=Began in 1952 by the Young Men’s Business League, this tournament has grown over the years to become one of the premier high school basketball events in Southeast Texas.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YMBL, BISD basketball tourney scheduled|url=http://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/YMBL-BISD-basketball-tourney-scheduled-5914027.php|publisher=Beaumont Enterprise|accessdate=December 29, 2014|date=November 24, 2014|quote=Originally called the YMBL Cage Tournament, the first tournament was held in 1952 and has grown to become one of the premier high school basketball showcase events in Southeast Texas.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==McDonald Gym highlights==

===1968-69 Season===

As evidenced by the lopsided won/loss record when it was the home court for Lamar basketball, McDonald Gym was a tough place for an opponent to win.  The 1968-69 season was a good example.  That year, McDonald Gym was the home court of one of the more memorable seasons in Lamar Cardinals history.  In addition to defeating several highly ranked NCAA Division I teams that season, Lamar defeated a previously unbeaten and sixth ranked [[Tulsa Golden Hurricane basketball|Tulsa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Rush Wood|title=Lamar basketball enjoyed fast start, No. 1 ranking 40 years ago|url=http://www.beaumontenterprise.com/sports/lamar/article/RUSH-WOOD-Lamar-basketball-enjoyed-fast-start-700000.php#ixzz1QEU2ltol|publisher=Beaumont Enterprise|accessdate=December 27, 2014|date=January 28, 2009|quote=With the Cardinals sitting at 6-0 and sixth-ranked University of Tulsa coming to town, most observers figured the good times were at an end. Instead, they kept rolling as Martin's flashy Cards decked Tulsa, 103-77.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well [[1968 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] [[Final Four]] team, [[Houston Cougars men's basketball|Houston]] at McDonald Gym.  That season was featured in a February 3, 1969 article in [[Sports Illustrated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Patrick F. Putnam|title=Lamar may be little, but it sure isn't minor|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1969/02/03/558465/lamar-may-be-little-but-it-sure-isnt-minor|publisher=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=December 27, 2014|date=February 3, 1969|quote=Undefeated, unsung and unbelieved, Lamar Tech of Beaumont has knocked off seven major teams in a major way and still the Cardinals are discounted. Bad show, pollsters. They are as good as their record}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Streak - Start of the 80 Game Home Court Winning Streak===

The men's basketball team's eighty (80) game home court winning streak started at McDonald Gym on February 18, 1978.  Before the Cardinals moved to their new home at the [[Beaumont Civic Center]], McDonald Gym saw the first thirty-seven (37) straight home wins of the streak.  When the streak ended on March 10, 1984, the Cardinals were owners of seventh (7th) longest home court winning streak in NCAA history.&lt;ref&gt;http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/lama/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/2010-11/misc_non_event/6-3-8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2326">'''Open chain exercises''' (OKC) are exercises that are performed where the [[hand]] or foot is free to move. The opposite of OKC are [[closed kinetic chain exercises]] (CKC). Both are effective for strengthening and rehabilitation objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Open and closed kinetic chain exercises improve shoulder joint reposition sense equally in healthy subjects. Rogol IM, Ernst G, Perrin DH. J Athl Train. 1998 Oct;33(4):315-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Closed-chain exercises tend to offer more "functional" athletic benefits because of their ability to recruit more muscle groups and require additional skeletal stabilization. &lt;ref&gt;Weight training of the thigh muscles using closed vs. open kinetic chain exercises: a comparison of performance enhancement. Augustsson J, Esko A, Thomeé R, Svantesson U. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther. 1998 Jan;27(1):3-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Single-joint versions of these exercises are typically non-weight bearing, with the movement occurring at the hinge joints ([[Elbow-joint|elbow]] or [[knee]]).&lt;ref&gt;Closed Kinetic Chain Exercise. A Comprehensive Guide to Multiple Joint Exercises. Todd Ellenbecker, George Davies 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-7360-0170-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is any weight applied, it is often applied to the distal portion of the limb. Open chain exercises are postulated to be advantageous in rehabilitation settings because they can be easily manipulated to selectively target specific muscles, or specific heads of certain muscles, more effectively than their closed chain counterparts, at different phases of contraction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1872">The '''Salem Civic Center''' is a 6,820-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Salem, Virginia]]. It was built in 1967 and is part of the James E. Taliaferro Sports and Entertainment Complex (named after a former mayor of Salem), which also includes the [[Salem Football Stadium]] and the [[Salem Memorial Baseball Stadium]].  The Salem Civic Center was originally known as the Salem-Roanoke Valley Civic Center, but the county withdrew its financial backing in the 1980s.

The civic center was home to the [[Salem Rebels]] [[ice hockey]] team in the 1970s.  The NCAA [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] men's college basketball championship is currently held at the civic center.  [[Boxing]], [[professional wrestling]], rodeos, and high school basketball games are typical events.

In addition to sporting events, the Salem Civic Center also hosts [[concerts]], [[circuses]], conventions and trade shows.  The annual Roanoke Valley Horse Show and Salem Fair are held at the civic center and the adjacent grounds.  It is also currently the largest convention facility in the [[Roanoke Valley]]; there is a total of {{convert|40000|sqft|m2|-3}} of space in the main arena, the community room (which can be divided into three smaller rooms) and three other rooms.

This is a list of the [[Major League Baseball]] players awarded by ''[[Sporting News]]'' (formerly ''TSN'', now ''SN'') since [[1936 in baseball|1936]] as recipients of the '''''Sporting News''''' '''Player of the Year Award'''.&lt;Ref Name="Baseball Almanac Player of the Year Award"&gt;{{cite web|title=Baseball Almanac Major League Player of the Year Award by The Sporting News|work=baseball-almanac.com|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/awards/aw_snml.shtml|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ''[[Sporting News]]'' established in 1936 the '''Player of the Year''' award.  It is the oldest and most prestigious award given to the single player in MLB who had the most outstanding season.  Until 1969, it was the only major award given to a single player from MLB, rather than to a player in each league. In 1969, ''[[Baseball Digest]]'' began its Player of the Year award for one player in all of MLB. (The award became limited to position players in 1994, when ''Baseball Digest'' added a new award for "Pitcher of the Year.") In 1993, the first [[Best Major League Baseball Player ESPY Award]] was given. In 1998, the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] (MLBPA) began its own [[Players Choice Award#Awards for one player in all of Major League Baseball|Player of the Year]] award, for one player in all of MLB, as part of its Players Choice Awards. [[Baseball America Major League Player of the Year|''Baseball America'']] also began its Major League Player of the Year award in 1998. In 2012, MLB's "GIBBY Awards" added an MLB Most Valuable Player category, which was renamed the Most Valuable Major Leaguer in 2014; its current name is the [[This Year in Baseball Awards|"Esurance MLB Awards" Best Major Leaguer]].

==Multiple Wins==

===Players===
Several players have won the award more than once. Ted Williams, Joe Morgan, Albert Pujols, Miguel Cabrera, and Jose Altuve are the only players to win the award in consecutive years.  Ted Williams won the award five times. Sandy Koufax is the only pitcher to win the award more than once.  Alex Rodriguez and Barry Bonds are the only players to win the award while playing with different teams. Stan Musial and Alex Rodriguez are the only players to win the award while playing different positions.  The only tie was in 1962, when Don Drysdale and Maury Wills shared the honor.  Alex Rodriguez and Barry Bonds are the only players to win the award with multiple teams.  Alex Rodriguez won the award with the most teams (3).  

Winning multiple SN Player of the Year awards has been seen as guaranteed admission to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]].  Barry Bonds is the only player with multiple awards, eligible for the Hall of Fame, but not a member of the Hall of Fame.   The table is of the Players that have won two or more awards and the year they were inducted into Major League Baseball Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="Wiki Hall of Fame Members"&gt;[[List of members of the Baseball Hall of Fame|Members of Baseball Hall of Fame]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Active players are not eligible for the Hall of Fame.

[[Image:Squash-tennis.jpg|thumb|240px|Plum Orchard squash tennis court]]
'''Squash tennis''' is an [[United States|American]] variant of [[squash (sport)|squash]], but played with a ball and racquets that are closer to the equipment used for [[tennis|lawn tennis]], and with somewhat different rules.  For younger players the game offers the complexity of squash and the speed of [[racquetball]].  It also has exercise and recreational potential for older players.

==Court==
Squash tennis is played in various four-walled courts.  The front wall (against which the ball is served) features a telltale (usually clad in tin) at the bottom couple feet from the floor, a service line about {{convert|6|ft}} from the floor, and an out-of-bounds line around {{convert|16|ft}} from the floor.  The back wall out line is {{convert|4.5|ft}} from the floor.  There are two required lines on the floor: a service line about {{convert|10|ft}} from the back wall, and a center court line running at least from the front wall to the service line.  Unlike a squash racquets court, there are no service boxes.  There are four types of courts:

===North American squash court===
A [[North America]]n squash court is {{convert|18.5|by|32|ft}}.  Originally designed for the related game of [[squash (sport)|squash racquets]], by the early 1930s the National Squash Tennis Association (NSTA) approved play on this kind of court.  The dimensions are quite similar to the official squash tennis court.  The only required modifications are the addition of a {{convert|4.5|ft|adj=on}} back wall line (in N. American squash the back wall line is {{convert|6.5|ft|disp=or}} from the floor) and the center court line on the floor. Temporary lines can easily be added with blue painter's tape. The problem today is that as the North American version of squash becomes less popular, new courts are not being built, and many old ones are being converted to other uses.

===Squash tennis court===
In 1910 the NSTA adopted a standard court size of {{convert|17|by|32.5|ft}}.  Although many of these were built in the New York area, after play was authorized on a N. American squash court they began to disappear.  It did not make economic sense to maintain a specialty court when a more versatile one was acceptable.

===International squash court===
An International squash court is {{convert|21|by|32|ft}}.  The additional lines will need to be added.  The extra width of the court makes the various multi-walled shots more difficult or impossible, so experienced players prefer to use a N. American court.  However, a {{convert|21|ft|adj=on}} court is often the only one generally available, particularly outside North America.

===Non-standard courts===
Originally the game was played on a [[racquets (sport)|racquets]] court, then on [[fives]] courts.  Before 1911 there were no standards for court size, and ones constructed specifically for squash tennis varied from each other somewhat.  They were constructed at private estates and clubs.  At least one of these courts survives today in a playable condition.  The court at Plum Orchard was fully restored in 2008 with the tins in place and working electric lights.  It was added to George Lauder Carnegie's "[[Plum Orchard]]" estate on [[Cumberland Island]], Georgia, in the winter of 1903/04, and is now owned by the [[National Park Service]]. An exhibit on squash tennis history has recently been installed in the mansion, which is occasionally open for public tours.

==Equipment==
Required equipment is fairly simple and inexpensive: junior [[tennis]] [[racquet]]s and standard lawn tennis ball.  In decades past, modified tennis balls were manufactured for the game.  They had higher pressure and were slightly smaller than tennis balls.  The last specially manufactured ball was green, so that it could be more easily seen against white walls.  Early courts had dark wood walls so that white tennis balls could be seen.  Players now either use a marker to darken a yellow ball, or use colored tennis balls (such as the pink ball sold on a limited basis by Penn to raise money for breast cancer research).  Blue painter's tape can be used to add the additional lines on the floor and back wall of squash racquets courts.

==Manner of play==
Squash tennis is played by two players.  An illustrated playing guide with rules was published by the NSTA in 1968 (see [[squash tennis#External links|external links]] below).

===Serve===
At the beginning of the first game, a spin of the racquet is used to decide who serves first. In subsequent games of a match, the player who won the previous game serves first.

The server stands behind the floor service line, either to the left or right of the center line.  Tossing the ball in the air, he strikes it with the racquet before the ball hits the ground.  The service is good if the ball:
* first hits the front wall above the service line and below the out line (touching the lines is prohibited),
* without hitting the back wall, lands in front of the service line on the opposite side of the court, left or right (depending on the side the server).

This is the major difference between squash tennis and squash racquets.  In the latter sport the ball must go beyond the floor service line into the receiver's box.  But it is similar to lawn tennis, as the ball is served diagonally and lands in front of the service line.  In squash racquets the server also stands in toward the side wall, rather than in the center of the court.

At the beginning, the server can choose which side he starts, left or right.  One fault is allowed if the ball does not go out (i.e. does not hit or go above the out lines, strikes the telltale, nor hits the floor before hitting the front wall).  If the server wins the point he must then switch to the opposite side of the court (left or right) before serving again, alternating each serve.

The standard serve is a gently hit ball that strikes just below the front wall out line, comes back in a high arc, then bounces just in front of the floor service line where it meets the side wall.  Slight cut will help the ball hug the wall.  A high bounce along the wall is more difficult to return.  The receiver cannot strike the ball before it bounces on the floor.

===Rally===

After a fair serve the receiver strikes the ball so that it either directly or indirectly hits the front wall before hitting the floor a second time, goes out of bounds, or strikes the tin.  Players thus alternate hitting the ball until one fails to make a fair return.  The ball can only be played off the back wall if the ball first hits the back wall.  A ball may hit anywhere on the back wall if it first bounces off the floor&amp;mdash;otherwise it must stay below the back wall out line.  Unintentional interference results in a "let"&amp;mdash;the point is replayed.

===Scoring===

A game is played until one player reaches 15 points, except if the score first reaches 13/13 or 14/14.  When 13/13 is reached, the receiver decides if the game should go to 15, 16, or 18 points.  If it reaches 14/14 (without having been 13/13) the receiver decides on either 15 or 17.  One does not have to win by two points.  Originally only the server could score; if he lost the rally he would lose the right to serve.  Current rules give the point and the serve to the winner of a rally.

A match is best three out of five games.

==History==

The games of [[squash (sport)|squash racquets]] and its parent sport, [[racquets (sport)|racquets]], spread to America in the 1880s with the nation's first courts built at [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]], in [[Concord, New Hampshire]]. Due to a delay in shipping the proper racquets' equipment, the boys used balls and racquets for the game of lawn tennis that had also been recently introduced to the country.  Even after the proper equipment arrived, some still continued to use tennis equipment on both kinds of courts.

In the 1890s both squash racquets and squash tennis had spread to adults in [[Boston]], and play started to become more formalized.  In 1898, after the construction of a court at the [[Tuxedo Club]] in [[Tuxedo Park, New York]], squash tennis became popular among members of New York society.  Private courts were built on estates owned by such millionaires as [[William C. Whitney]], J. P. Morgan, and George Lauder Carnegie.  By 1905, the [[Racquet and Tennis Club]], Harvard, Princeton, and Columbia Clubs in Manhattan had courts, as did Brooklyn's Crescent A. C. and the Heights Casino.

In 1911 the National Squash Tennis Association was founded and organized by the banker, John W. Prentiss, Harvard Club of New York.  Rules, equipment, and court dimensions became formalized.

Briefly the sport gained popularity and some limited play in other cities such as Detroit, Buffalo, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, but soon squash racquets overshadowed squash tennis.  But in [[New York City]] the game maintained a strong following during the 1920s and 1930s.  A decision to introduce a highly pressurized ball hastened the decline of the sport.  A faster ball was preferred by advanced players, but it discouraged novices.  In an effort to make the game more accessible, tournament play was authorized on squash racquets courts.  But for many years the sport attracted few new players.  During World War II the special ball was no longer manufactured, so advanced players started to lose interest.

Two outstanding champions of the fifties were Robert Reeve and Trudy Porter. League play and tournaments continued with energy supplied by Norman F. Torrance in the 1950s. The sixties saw a revival as younger players took up the game and Jim Prigoff became National Champion and later President of the Squash Tennis Association and Richard C. "Dick" Squires became active when a special ball was once again available to players. Prigoff dominated the Nationals in the 1960s beating both Squires and Bacallao until he retired from the game in 1969. But competition by the new game of [[racquetball]] prevented these later attempts from making any headway with the public.  The annual nationals became the only formal tournament, but became the virtual private property of two men, Pedro A. Bacallao (1969-1980, 1986) and Gary Squires (1982-1983, 1985, 1987-2000) son of Dick Squires.

==Squash tennis status==
{{original research|date=April 2018}}
The game is virtually extinct.  There are no organized tournaments. The game is played on a regular basis only by about a dozen players at the Harvard Club in New York City; although longtime enthusiast Bill Rubin stated that there are a few young, very talented, new players.  The NSTA has not held a meeting in several years.

The basic equipment is inexpensive, however, and for those with access to a squash court it can easily be enjoyed for its recreational and exercise value.  Dick Squires published a guide to the sport in 1968.  The booklet was not copyrighted, and is available online at [[Project Gutenberg]].  The guide includes pointers on how to play the game, history, rules, and a list of all national champions.

In sports, '''stat padding''' is an action that improves a player's [[statistics]] despite being of little benefit to his or her team or its chance of winning. An example would be a [[gridiron football]] player throwing long passes with an empty backfield on first down in the fourth quarter of a game in which his team was already leading by a large margin.

Stat padding is also noticeable in [[online game|online computer games]]. A group of players might perform a series of actions which generally require little skill in order to raise a player's statistics. For example, in [[first person shooter]]s, two or more players might join different teams and constantly kill one another, usually followed by a heal, revive, or [[respawn]]. Actions such as these are usually done on password-protected or empty [[game server]]s. An example of this in the popular online computer game [[Battlefield 2]] would be when three players collude, one as a medic, another from the other team as a killer, and another person from the medic's team, called the "dummy", to be the victim. The killer shoots the dummy, and the medic then heals or revives his teammate. The killer shoots the dummy again and the process continues. 

It is also possible to stat pad by completing objectives or performing actions in an empty server, or by co-operating with a player on another team. While co-operating with players on another team may pad stats, this is widely considered a form of [[cheating]].

The '''Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award''', or '''Super Bowl MVP''', is presented annually to the [[most valuable player]] of the [[Super Bowl]], the [[National Football League]]'s (NFL) championship game. The winner is chosen by a fan vote during the game and by a panel of 16 [[American football|football]] writers and broadcasters who vote after the game.

'''Sweeney Field'''  (previously called Finnesey Field) is a multi-use sports facility on the [[Saint Joseph's University]] campus in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], which opened in 1929 and was originally planned to be the centerpiece to a 70,000 seat football stadium in the natural bowl of the campus. 

In 1960, both the original grandstand and hillside seating were eliminated for the construction of Villiger (now Post) Building/Bluett Theater. That construction necessitated raising the field's level some five feet above its earlier location. In 1990, the facility's usage was greatly expanded with the installation of artificial turf. That expansion continued in 1994 when lights were added. During the summer of 2001, the Field received a facelift when new turf was installed. More recently, bleachers were built into the hill closest to Barbelin Hall and on either end of the field. &lt;ref&gt;[http://sjuhawks.cstv.com/facilities/stjs-finnesey-field.html Saint Joseph's University - Official Athletic Site&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 2008, the field was resurfaced with a FIFA approved surface called TigerTurf, and the track was completely resurfaced. The field will play host to men's and women's soccer and men's and women's lacrosse. The women's field hockey team played its last season on Finnesey Field in 2007. They open on a new playing surface on the Maguire Campus in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sjuhawks.cstv.com/facilities/stjs-finnesey-field.html Finnesey history]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the field was home field for the [[Philadelphia Spinners]] of [[Major League Ultimate]] for two games. Both games resulted in wins over the [[Boston Whitecaps]]. They were two of the highest attended games for the Spinners that season. 

2015 boasted a new scoreboard for the field; with added information such as player number and foul counter. The new scoreboard is located to the left of the original one.

Overall, the site has seen 1,053 games entering the 2008-09 academic year, and SJU teams put together a total record of 493-518-42 in 79 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sjuhawks.cstv.com/facilities/stjs-finnesey-field.html Finnesey history]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tall Story''''' is a 1960 American [[romance film|romantic comedy film]] made by [[Warner Bros.]], directed by [[Joshua Logan]] and starring [[Anthony Perkins]] with [[Jane Fonda]], in her first screen role.  It is based on the 1957 novel ''The Homecoming Game'' by [[Howard Nemerov]], which was the basis of a successful 1959 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway play]], called ''Tall Story'', by the writing team of [[Howard Lindsay]] and [[Russel Crouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/26575/Tall-Story/screenplay-info.html|title=Tall Story (1960) - Screenplay Info - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ibdb"&gt;{{cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=2069 |title=Tall Story â€“ Broadway Play â€“ Original |publisher=IBDB |date= |accessdate=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a considerable departure from Logan's previous two projects, the drama ''[[Sayonara]]'', which won multiple [[Academy Awards]], and the blockbuster ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' and was [[Robert Redford]]'s first film, where he played an uncredited [[basketball]] player.

The film is a [[Farce|farcical]] social [[satire]] of American campus life, making fun of the way college life can become a marriage market for some students. Fonda portrays a character who is the complete opposite of the independent liberated woman she later personified.

==Plot==
At Custer University, Ray Blent is an honor student and college basketball star. June Ryder has come to the university to study [[home economics]] and to find a husband. Both students and faculty are scandalized by Ryder's unashamed pursuit of Blent. She joins the pom-pom girls and attends all the classes taken by Blent to ensure she has maximum contact with him.  Everyone is aware of her designs on the sexually naive Blent, except for him. She succeeds in convincing him that she has an intelligent, inquiring mind that he admires, although this is all done through deception. She eventually gets Blent to fall for her and propose marriage. However, they need several thousand dollars to set up a home.

Blent is secretly propositioned, via a radio message, by a gambling syndicate to lose a key game with a visiting Russian team. He refuses to do this, but is unable to return the money as he does not know who is behind the bribe. Rather than deliberately throw the game, he decides to deliberately fail an ethics exam, which automatically disqualifies him from playing. He is the best student in class and the only way he can fail is by copying Ryder's paper. Too late he realizes that his not playing is tantamount to ensuring his team will lose, and that he has given the gamblers exactly what they want.

Meanwhile, his ethics professor, Leo Sullivan, is coming under extreme student and faculty pressure to reverse the failure and give Blent a passing grade. He refuses to do this on principle, but finally consents to give Blent an oral retest while the game is in progress. Blent passes and plays for the last few minutes, achieving a one-point victory for the school.

==Production==
The film's working title was "The Way the Ball Bounces".&lt;ref name=notes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/26575/Tall-Story/notes.html|title=Tall Story (1960) - Notes - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Producer/director [[Joshua Logan]] originally intended the film to be a vehicle for both Jane Fonda and [[Warren Beatty]] to make their screen debuts, but Warner Bros. would not approve the unknown Beatty for the part, and Logan had to settle for his second choice, Anthony Perkins.&lt;ref name=tcmart /&gt;

Fonda had hated the Broadway play, but was pleased that her part in the film script had been expanded. Logan was a good friend of her father, [[Henry Fonda]], and saw Jane as a potential major star.  He wanted to guide her through her first film experience &amp;ndash; she had been modelling for several years &amp;ndash; but Fonda found it a "Kafkaesque nightmare," explaining in her autobiography ''My Life So Far'' that during the making of ''Tall Story'' she suffered from bulimia, sleepwalking and irrational fears that she was "boring, untalented and plain."&lt;ref name=tcmart /&gt;

Campus scenes were filmed at [[Occidental College]] in [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles]] [[California]].

==Reception==
On its release in 1960, the film was neither a commercial nor a critical success.  A ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reviewer wrote: "Nothing could possibly save the picture, not even the painfully personable Perkins doing his famous awkward act, not even a second-generation Fonda with a smile like her father's and legs like a chorus girl."&lt;ref name=tcmart&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/26575/Tall-Story/articles.html|title=Tall Story (1960) - Articles - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Women's World Chess Championship]] 2017''' was a 64-player [[knock-out tournament]], to decide the women's world chess champion. The final was won by [[Tan Zhongyi]] over [[Anna Muzychuk]] in the rapid tie-breaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chessdom.com/tan-zhongyi-is-the-women-world-chess-champion/ | title=Tan Zhongyi is the Women World Chess Champion! | publisher=chessdom.com | date=3 March 2017 | accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the FIDE General Assembly during the [[42nd Chess Olympiad]] in [[Baku]] in September 2016, the organizational rights to the event were awarded to [[Iran]], who held the Championship in [[Tehran]] from 10 February to 4 March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/9838-general-assembly-2016-decisions.html|title=General Assembly 2016 Decisions|date=2016-09-27|website=FIDE|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some top female players decided not to attend the tournament. [[Hou Yifan]], the outgoing women's world champion and top ranked female player, decided not to enter the tournament because of dissatisfaction with [[FIDE]]'s Women's World Championship system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/why-hou-yifan-has-dropped-out-of-the-cycle|title=Why Hou Yifan has dropped out of the cycle|last=Friedel|first=Frederic|date=20 May 2016|website=Chess News|publisher=ChessBase}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 Women's World Champion, [[Mariya Muzychuk]], and US Women's Champion [[Nazi Paikidze]] also elected not to attend, out of protest at the tournament's location in Iran, where it is mandatory for all women to wear a [[hijab]] in public (a rule which also applied to the participating players). Other notable absentees were women's world number four [[Humpy Koneru]] and seven-time US Women's Champion [[Irina Krush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/fide-announces-participants-of-wwch-2017|title=Women's World Championship 2017: Who plays, who doesn't?|last=Fischer|first=Johannes|date=2017-01-12|website=Chess News|publisher=ChessBase}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 May 2017 FIDE suspended the Chess Federation of Iran for non-payment of Women's World Championship prizes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chessdom.com/fide-suspended-chess-federation-of-iran/&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 June 2017, the ban was lifted.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/10235-sanctions-regarding-the-iranian-chess-federation-have-been-lifted.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hosting==
The tournament was originally placed on the [[FIDE]] calendar for October 2016. However, the March 2016 meeting of the FIDE Presidential Board ultimately postponed the event to 2017 due to a lack of organizer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/9549-list-of-decisions-of-the-2016-1st-quarter-fide-pb.html March 2016 FIDE PB decisions] (1PB-2016/19 and 1PB-2016/14).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="agenda-5207"&gt;[https://www.fide.com/images/stories/NEWS_2016/FIDE_News/GA_Agenda_2016/2016_General_Assembly_Agenda.pdf FIDE General Assembly Agenda] (5.20.7)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The original [[agenda (meeting)|agenda]] for the General Assembly made no explicit mention of Iran, only indicating that the event had been postponed until 2017 due to the lack of an organizer,&lt;ref name="agenda-5207" /&gt; similar to the situations in 2014 and 2015. When the agenda item (5.20.7) for Women's World Championship came up for discussion in Baku, Iran offered to host the event, and after a brief discussion of the applicable [[dress code]], none of the 159 attending delegates objected.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chessdailynews.com/345635-2/|title=Official Statement From FIDE About The Women's World Championship in Iran|date=2016-10-02|newspaper=Susan Polgar Global Chess Daily News and Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only when FIDE published the General Assembly decisions two weeks later the existence of the Iran offer become widely known, and the issue rapidly became explosive, in part due to the [[social media]] activity of [[Nigel Short]], who alternatively claimed that awarding the event to Iran was against FIDE Statutes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chess.com/news/view/women-world-championship-in-iran-and-other-fide-decisions-2773|title=2017 Women's World Championship Awarded To Iran; Other FIDE Decisions - Chess.com|last=Doggers|first=Peter|date=2016-09-28|newspaper=Chess.com|access-date=2017-02-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|language=en-US|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Code of Ethics (or founding Principles) of the [[International Olympic Committee]].

[[Nazi Paikidze]], who qualified by finishing tied for 2nd in the 2015 [[U.S. Women's Chess Championship|US Women's Championship]], was the first female player to protest FIDE's decision to allow Iran to host the event. Through the media she has announced that she will not participate most particularly because of Iran's dress code requiring women to wear a [[hijab]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2016/10/05/the-american-chess-champion-challenging-irans-hijab-fetish/ Nomani, Asra Q &amp; Alinejad, Masih. “The American chess champion challenging Iran’s hijab fetish.”] ''The Washington Post''. 5 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; though initially she also secondarily mentioned the risks to Americans and other foreigners of being detained in Iran because of their nationality. In a later petition on [[Change.org]] she included a third item, namely that there could be speech restrictions on women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/10/06/i-will-not-wear-a-hijab-u-s-chess-star-refuses-to-attend-world-championships-in-iran/|title=‘I will NOT wear a hijab’: U.S. chess star refuses to attend world championships in Iran|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Speech restrictions on sporting participants are often mandated, for instance [[Rule 40]] at the [[Olympics]], conduct clauses in contracts as with [[Steve Clevenger]], and perhaps a close analogue would be the [[American Contract Bridge League]] having a [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/arts/14brid.html dispute] against some of its representatives at the 2007 World Bridge Championships, for using this as a platform to display a political message. However, Paikidze is noting that women have been arrested in Iran for speaking out on women's rights, for instance [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/22/iran-missing-womens-rights-activist Maryam Majd].&lt;/ref&gt;

Chess, like other sports, has had a degree of controversy regarding women's attire. A statement from FIDE Press Officer [[Anastasiya Karlovich]] was published at [[Susan Polgar]]'s site ''Chess Daily News'' on October 1, 2016, indicating that FIDE has not received any official complaints to date (including from prior women's events held in Iran), but that they would be reviewing all possible solutions for the players’ comfort and would discuss all the issues with the organizers in Iran during meetings in the next few weeks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Polgar requested that concerned participants contact the FIDE Women's Commission, of which she is co-chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chessdailynews.com/my-response-to-cnn-regarding-the-upcoming-womens-world-championship/|title=My response to CNN regarding the upcoming Women's World Championship|date=2016-09-29|newspaper=Susan Polgar Global Chess Daily News and Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Emil Sutovsky]], the president of the [[Association of Chess Professionals]] (ACP), hosted discussions at his [[Facebook]] page on the matter, and wrote an official letter to [[FIDE]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://facebook.com/emil.sutovsky/posts/10154228376124681 Post 1] (Russian), [http://facebook.com/emil.sutovsky/posts/10154230667859681 Post 2], [http://facebook.com/emil.sutovsky/posts/10154236168169681 Post 3]&lt;/ref&gt; He also noted that while he has talked to at least half the participants and the vast majority do not want to boycott, the ACP would respect the rights of others too.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sport-express.ru/chess/reviews/sportsmenki-ustroili-boykot-protiv-hidzhabov-1051484/|title=Спортсменки устроили бойкот против хиджабов|date=2016-10-05|newspaper=[[Sport Express]]|access-date=2017-02-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|language=ru|trans-title=Athletes staged a boycott against hijab|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natalia Zhukova]], [[Alexandra Kosteniuk]], [[Anna Muzychuk]], and [[Elisabeth Paehtz]] have all made public comments to Sutovsky, but none to the degree of Nazi Paikidze.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} Sutovsky was willing to entertain Nigel Short's claims regarding the illegality of FIDE's actions, but simultaneously would not pursue them (either personally or as ACP president) until a proper legal argument was made on the matter.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

[[ChessBase]] India interviewed two of the three qualifiers from that country ([[Harika Dronavalli]] and [[Humpy Koneru]]), each of whom has played in Iran previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chessbase.in/news/humpy-and-harika-in-iran|title=Humpy, Harika and Padmini ready to play in Iran|last=Shah|first=Sagar|date=2016-10-01|website=chessbase.in|publisher=ChessBase India|access-date=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; They indicated a degree of awkwardness and discomfort with the physical aspects of the headscarf while playing (as had Zhukova), but declared the World Championship itself to be more important. Later articles quoted Kosteniuk and Koneru expanding on their views, with the former noting that even exercising for fitness in Iran can be difficult for a woman.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/sport-others/world-women-chess-championship-iran-hijab-prison-3065905/|title=Iran’s hijab law triggers scepticism among players before World Chess Championship|date=2016-10-05|newspaper=The Indian Express|access-date=2017-02-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIDE.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final match==
[[File:AMuzychuk1 Ukr Ch 2014.jpg|thumb|Muzychuk reached the final without playing a single tie-break.]]
The final was the only match of the tournament which consists of four classical games. Those were played on consecutive days with a rest-day between the semi-final tie-breaks and match 1. Eventual tie-breaks were played on 3 March 2017, in the same manner as the whole tournament. Two rapid games of 25+10 (i.e. 25 minutes for the whole game plus 10 seconds increment), the two rapid games of 10+10, two blitz games of 5+3 and an armageddon decider.

[[Anna Muzychuk]], the reigning women's blitz and rapid world champion, had advanced to the final without playing a tie-break. [[Tan Zhongyi]] on the other hand played several, including two armageddon matches. One of those in the semi-final against [[Harika Dronavalli]], who had been knocked-out at semi final stage for the third straight time. Before the finals, Tan Zhongyi and Anna Muzychuk had met each other just two times at classical time-control, with both games ending in a draw.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chessgames.com/perl/ezsearch.pl?search=zhongyi+vs+anna+muzychuk&lt;/ref&gt;

After a draw in the first game, Tan outplayed her opponent to win game 2, however Muzychuk came back with a crushing early victory in game 3. Game 4 was a quiet draw, setting the stage for a rapid playoff. In the first pair of rapid matches, Tan Zhongyi won the title. Consequently, she was also awarded the [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] title.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7673">"'''World Forum/Communist Quiz'''" is a [[Monty Python]] sketch, which first aired in the 12th episode of the second season of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' on 15 December 1970. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=ZTAFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA333&amp;lpg=PA333&amp;dq=world+communist+forum+monty+python+actors&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9CmVdxji9F&amp;sig=TYQW0aBgMNSHjLpKWq35sI8M5M4&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3n5CFtdDQAhXG1BoKHV-gDgsQ6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=world%20communist%20forum%20monty%20python%20actors&amp;f=false |title=Monty Python: A Chronology, 1969-2012 |edition=2nd |author=Douglas McCall |page=333 |website=Books.google.be |date= |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured four icons of [[Communism|Communist]] thought, namely [[Karl Marx]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Ché Guevara]] and [[Mao Zedong]] being asked [[quiz]] questions.

==The sketch==
A [[quiz]] show named "World Forum" is hosted by [[Eric Idle]]. He introduces his four guests, [[Karl Marx]] (played by [[Terry Jones]]), [[Vladimir Lenin]] (played by Eden Fox), [[Che Guevara]] (played by [[Terry Gilliam]]) and [[Mao Zedong]] (played by Basil Tang).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/820869120|title=Monty Python's flying circus : an utterly complete, thoroughly unillustrated, absolutely unauthorized guide to possibly all the references : from Arthur "Two-Sheds" Jackson to Zambesi|last=1963-|first=Larsen, Darl,|date=2008|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9781461669708|location=Lanham, Md.|oclc=820869120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite announcing this event as a "unique occasion in the history of television" the host then simply starts asking these historical figures trivial quiz questions. &lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=kKUpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=world+communist+forum+monty+python+actor+who+played+mao&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kXkDrIiLrd&amp;sig=Kb8Ml_O6rd_pL46x79zQQEaI_to&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFspDytdDQAhVKlxoKHT14BgcQ6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=world%20communist%20forum%20monty%20python%20actor%20who%20played%20mao&amp;f=false |title=Everything I Ever Needed to Know About _____* I Learned from Monty Python ... |author1=Brian Cogan, Ph.D. |author2=Jeff Massey, Ph.D. |page=64 |website=Books.google.be |date=2014-03-18 |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marx is asked which English football team is nicknamed "the Hammers". He has obviously no idea (in reality it's [[West Ham United F.C.]]). Idle then asks Guevara a different question, namely in which year [[Coventry City FC]] last won the [[FA Cup]]? When Guevara also fails to give any answer at all Idle throws the question open to the other guests, but still receives no answer from any of then. Idle then says: "Well, I'm not surprised you didn't get that. It was in fact a [[trick question]]: Coventry City have never won the FA Cup." With the scores all equal the second quiz round begins. Idle asks Lenin the name of the song by [[Teddy Johnson]] and [[Pearl Carr]] which won the 1959's [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. Lenin has no clue, so Idle once again throws the question open. Unexpectedly Mao rings his [[buzzer]] and gives the correct answer: "[[Sing Little Birdie]]".&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

Idle then takes Marx to the ''special gift section'' of the quiz. He is able to win a beautiful lounge suite if he is able to answer all questions correctly. The host announces that Marx has chosen questions on the ''workers control of factories'' as his special subject. He asks Marx by what other development the industrial [[proletariat]] is conditioned, to which Marx correctly answers: "The development of the industrial [[bourgeoisie]]". Idle continues asking what kind of struggle the struggle of [[class (philosophy)|class]] against class is, to which Marx again correctly replies: "A political struggle". &lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; The final question however turns out to be another sports question, when Marx is asked who won the [[1949 FA Cup Final]]? As Marx desperately tries to reply unrelated things like "the worker's control of the means of production" and "the struggle of the urban proletariat" the host informs him that he lost and that the correct answer was in fact the [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.]] who beat [[Leicester City F.C.]], 3-1. The broadcast closes with stock footage of a crowd cheering over a winning goal during an association football match. A caption announces that "next week" the four leading heads of state of the Afro-Asian Nations will be playing against [[Bristol Rovers]] at [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]].

==Notes about the sketch==
Despite what the host says, the winning song of the  [[Eurovision Song Contest 1959|1959 Eurovision Song Contest]] was not "Sing Little Birdie", but Dutch singer [[Teddy Scholten]]'s "[[Een Beetje]]". 

On 16 May 1987, 17 years after this sketch was first broadcast, [[Coventry City F.C.]] did in fact win the [[1987 FA Cup Final]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Robert, ''Monty Python Encyclopedia'', 1999, TV Books, {{ISBN|978-1575000367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The questions asked of Marx in the ''special gift section'' of the quiz are all references to his book ''[[Communist Manifesto]]''.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

Later in the same ''Flying Circus'' episode, in which a sketch about the [[First Battle of Ypres]] is having difficulty getting started, the camera cuts to a quick shot of Marx and Guevara on the World Forum set, who are now kissing and embracing each other. At the end of the episode after the final credits roll, Marx &amp; Guevara are seen in bed together.

==In other media==
An audio version of the sketch can be heard on the extended US version of ''[[Another Monty Python Record]]'' (1971), with live recordings released on ''[[Monty Python Live at Drury Lane]]'' (1974) and ''[[Monty Python Live at City Center]]'' (1976). 

The sketch was also featured in the 1982 concert film ''[[Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl]]'', where Eric Idle reprised his role as the quiz host and Terry Jones as Marx. The other roles were portrayed by different actors, though. [[John Cleese]] took on the role of Lenin, [[Michael Palin]] played Guevara and [[Terry Gilliam]] in [[yellowface]] acted as Mao. While the sketch mostly follows the same pattern as in the TV broadcast there are some notable differences. Idle's final question to the four guests is the name of [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]' biggest hit, to which Mao correctly answers "[[Great Balls of Fire]]", albeit in an [[Engrish]] accent. When Idle shows Marx the lounge suit he might win he adds that it is a "beautiful non-[[materialism|materialistic]] lounge suite." While Marx didn't say anything after losing in the TV sketch he does react to his loss here, by using the strong language: "Oh, shit!" Idle also pushes him away with the aggressive order: "Get out of here!", then says: "Well, no one leaves this show empty-handed, so we're gonna cut off his hands." 

The original TV sketch was added to the compilation video ''[[Parrot Sketch Not Included - 20 Years of Monty Python]]'' (1989) and ''Monty Python's Flying Circus: Michael Palin's Personal Best''.
