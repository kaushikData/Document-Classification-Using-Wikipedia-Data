'''Allegorical interpretation of the Bible''' is an interpretive method ([[exegesis]]) that assumes that the [[Bible]] has various levels of meaning and tends to focus on the spiritual sense, which includes the [[allegory|allegorical sense]], the [[tropological reading|moral (or tropological)]] sense, and the [[anagoge|anagogical sense]], as opposed to the [[literal and figurative language|literal]] sense. It is sometimes referred to as the ''[[quadriga]]'', a reference to the Roman chariot that was drawn by four horses.

Allegorical interpretation has its origins in both Greek thought and the [[rabbinical school]]s of Judaism. In the Middle Ages, it was used by Bible commentators of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan A. Barney (1989). "Allegory". Dictionary of the Middle Ages. Vol-1. {{ISBN|0-684-16760-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four types==
[[File:Wright The Journey of Life 1775 Cornell CUL PJM 1025 01.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.0| Christian allegorical map of The Journey of Life, or an Accurate Map of the Roads, Counties, Towns &amp;c. in the Ways to Happiness &amp; Misery, 1775]]
Scriptural interpretation is sometimes referred to as the ''[[Quadriga]]'', a reference to the Roman chariot that was pulled by four horses abreast. The four horses are symbolic of the four submethods of Scriptural interpretation:

* Literal interpretation: explanation of the meaning of events for historical purposes from a neutral perspective by trying to understand the text in the culture and time it was written, and location and language it was composed in. That is, since the 19th century, usually ascertained using the higher critical methods like source criticism and form criticism. In many modern seminaries and universities, the literal meaning is usually focused on to a nearly complete abandonment of the spiritual methods, as is very obvious when comparing commentary from a Douay Rheims or Confraternity or Knox Bible with a New Jerusalem, New RSV or NABRE.&lt;ref&gt;Glucksberg, Sam (2001-07-26). ''Understanding Figurative Language from Metaphor to Idioms: From Metaphor to Idioms''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780195111095}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anagogic interpretation: dealing with the future events of Christian history (eschatology) as well as heaven, purgatory, hell, the last judgement, the General Resurrection and second Advent of Christ, etc. (prophecies).&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Online, S.V. "Anagogical Interpretation", Accessed March 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Typological (or allegorical) interpretation: connecting the events of the Old Testament with the New Testament, particularly drawing allegorical connections between the events of Christ’s life with the stories of the Old Testament. Also, a passage speaks directly to someone such as when [[Francis of Assisi]] heard the passage to sell all he had. It can also typologically point to the Blessed Virgin Mary, who is the ark which held the Word of God; Judith, who slew a tyrant is a Marian type; the burning bush, which contains the fire of God but was not consumed, as Mary held the Second Person of the Trinity in her womb but was not burnt up.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, Virginia (1992). The Risen Adam: D.H. Lawrence’s Revisionist Typology. {{ISBN|0271028459}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tropological (or moral) interpretation: "the [[moral of the story]]," or how one should act now. Many of Jesus' parables and the [[Book of Proverbs]] and other wisdom books are packed with tropological meaning&lt;ref&gt;Herbermann, Charles, ed. (1913). “Scriptural Tropology”. Catholic Encyclopaedia. Robert Appleton Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Latin rhyme designed to help scholars remember the four interpretations survives from the Middle Ages:
{{quote|''Litera gesta docet, Quid credas allegoria,
''Moralis quid agas, Quo tendas anagogia''.&lt;ref name="auto1" &gt;Grant, Robert M. (1963). A Short History of Biblical Interpretation. New York. {{ISBN|0800617622}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The rhyme is roughly translated:

The literal teaches what God and our ancestors did,

The allegory is where our faith and belief is hid,

The moral meaning gives us the rule of daily life,

The anagogy shows us where we end our strife.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

==Antiquity ==
[[Origen]], in his ''Treatise on First Principles'', recommends for the Old and New Testaments to be interpreted allegorically at three levels, the "flesh," the "soul," and the "spirit." He states that many of the events recounted in the Scriptures, if they are interpreted in the literal, or fleshly, sense, are impossible or nonsensical. They must be interpreted allegorically to be understood. Some passages have parts that are literally true and parts that are literally impossible. Then, "the reader must endeavor to grasp the entire meaning, connecting by an intellectual process the account of what is literally impossible with the parts that are not impossible but historically true, these being interpreted allegorically in common with the part which, so far as the letter goes, did not happen at all."&lt;ref&gt;''On First Principles'', in ''Readings in World Christian History'' (2013), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament==
It is a common misconception that [[Paul the Apostle]]'s [[Letter to the Galatians]], in the [[New Testament]], interprets the story of [[Sarah]] and [[Hagar]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 16:1-6) allegorically (Galatians 4:21-24). Rather Paul is explaining an allegory - these are two entirely different things.  An explanation is not a call for universal use of an interprative method.  Paul explains Hagar's son [[Ishmael]] is a representation of the fleshly children of [[Abraham]] and Sarah's son [[Isaac]] is a representation of the spiritual children of Abraham, the "children of the promise."

==Middle Ages==
People of the [[Middle Ages]] shaped their ideas and institutions from drawing on the cultural legacies of the ancient world.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;William R. Cook and Ronald B. Herzman (2001). Discovering the Middle Ages. The Teaching Company. {{ISBN|1-56585-701-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not see the break between themselves and their predecessors that today's observers see; they saw continuity with themselves and the ancient world by using allegory to bring together the gaps.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; The use of allegorical interpretation in the Middle Ages began as a Christian method for studying the differences between the two Testaments (tropological interpretation).&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; Christian scholars believed both Testaments were equally inspired divinely by God and sought to understand the differences between Old Testament and New Testament laws.&lt;ref name="biologos"&gt;http://biologos.org/questions/early-interpretations-of-genesis&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval scholars believed the Old Testament to serve as an allegory of New Testament events, such as the story of Jonah and the whale, which represents Jesus' death and resurrection.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; According to the Old Testament [[Book of Jonah]], a prophet spent three days in the belly of a fish. Medieval scholars believed this was an allegory (using the typological interpretation) of Jesus' death and his being in the tomb for three days before he rose from the dead.

Another popular allegorical work studied in the Middle Ages comes from [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan A. Barney (1989). “Allegory.” Dictionary of the Middle Ages. Vol-1. {{ISBN|0-684-16760-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the story, commonly known as the [[Allegory of the Cave]], Plato describes a group of people who have lived chained to the wall of a cave all their lives facing a blank wall. The people watch shadows projected on the wall by things passing in front of a fire and begin to ascribe forms to the shadows.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, Stephen (1997), "Introduction: The Theory of Forms (Books 5–7)", Plato: Republic, London: Wordsworth Editions, pp. pages xiv–xvi, {{ISBN|1-85326-483-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4439">The '''Applied Research in Patacriticism''' ('''ARP''') was a [[digital humanities]] lab based at the [[University of Virginia]] founded and run by [[Jerome McGann]] and [[Johanna Drucker]].  ARP's [[open-source]] tools include Juxta, IVANHOE, and Collex.  Collex is the [[social software]] and [[faceted classification|faceted browsing]] backbone of the NINES federation.  ARP was funded by the [[Mellon Foundation]].

==Projects==
===IVANHOE===

IVANHOE is an [[open source]] electronic [[role-playing game]] for educational use.  It was developed by ARP at the [[University of Virginia]].  It is so named because [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s novel, ''[[Ivanhoe]]'', was used as the source text for the very first IVANHOE game.  IVANHOE is notable as an example of the use of [[ludic interface|ludic]] or game-related techniques in higher education in the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://texttechnology.mcmaster.ca/pdf/vol12_2_06.pdf Geoffrey Rockwell, Serious Play at Hand: Is Gaming Serious Research in the Humanities? in: ''TEXT Technology'' 2 (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===NINES===

NINES is the '''Networked Infrastructure for Nineteenth-century Electronic Scholarship''', a scholarly organization in British and American nineteenth-century studies supported by ARP, a software development group assembling a suite of critical and editorial tools for digital scholarship.  It was founded in 2003 by [[Jerome McGann]] at the [[University of Virginia]].  

NINES serves as a clearinghouse for [[peer-reviewed]] digital resources, which can be collected, annotated, and re-used in online "exhibits."  It is powered by [[open-source]] [[Collex]] software.

In 2011, the NINES model was expanded to include a sister site in eighteenth-century studies, called 18thConnect.

===Collex===

Collex is an [[open source]] [[social software]] and [[faceted classification|faceted browsing]] tool designed for [[digital humanities]].  It includes [[folksonomy]] features and is under construction at ARP.  The first release of Collex is used in the [[NINES (initiative)|NINES initiative]], but it is a [http://collex.org generalizable tool] that can be applied to other subject domains.  Collex is an early example of a scholar-driven [[Library 2.0]] initiative and, like NINES, was conceived as a response to economic problems in [[tenure]] and [[academic publishing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nines.org/about/Nowviskie-Collex.pdf Bethany Nowviskie, Collex: Semantic Collections and Exhibits for the Remixable Web]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juxta===

Juxta is an [[open-source]] tool for performing [[bibliography|bibliographical]] collations for scholarly use in [[textual criticism]].  It was developed by ARP at the [[University of Virginia]] under the direction of textual theorist [[Jerome McGann]]. The original application was a Java-based client [http://www.juxtasoftware.org available for free download].

In October 2012, the Research and Development team at NINES released [http://juxtacommons.org Juxta Commons], a fully online version of the software.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22907">'''Architectural endoscopy''' or '''architectural envisioning''' is used to photograph and film models of new buildings' exterior and interior in the planning stage. An [[architectural model]] of a new building in a 1:500 scale is thus correctly visualized from the [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] of a pedestrian walking by in the street. An endoscope connected to a video camera allows for the creation of walkthroughs, allowing the architect to develop the first draft further, and the public to share and critique the architect's vision of proposed buildings and cities.

== Nomenclature ==
In architecture the rigid [[Endoscopy|endoscope]] is called a ''Relatoskop'' (German), ''relatoscop'' (French), [[borescope]], etc. In this article, 'endoscope' is used as a generic term.

== History ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-28849-0005, Rostock, Architekten bei der Stadtplanung.jpg|thumb|Architects examining a model (urban planning) from a bird's-eye view, [[Rostock]], 1955]]

The endoscope was invented in 1806 by [[Philipp Bozzini]], in medicine it was used to look inside the human body.&lt;ref&gt;Bozzini (1806), {{Google books|dn8tAAAAcAAJ||page=107-124 ''Lichtleiter, eine Erfindung zur Anschauung innerer Teile und Krankheiten, nebst der Abbildung'', Journal der practischen Arzneykunde und Wundarzneykunst}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, the Paris-based German architect, [[Martin Schulz van Treeck]] (van Treeck), was the first to use endoscopes for visualisation of architectural models. The endoscopes were his father's, [[Alfred Schulz van Treeck]], physician and pioneer in [[Otoscope|otoscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;The father of Martin Schulz van Treeck [http://www.geni.com/people/Alfred-Schulz-van-Treeck/6000000013443143150 Alfred Schulz van Treeck]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=orgues&gt;Jean-François Pousse [http://www.lemoniteur.fr/article/l-invention-de-la-tour-europeenne-13-30-les-orgues-de-flandre-1976-paris-754715 Orgues de Flandre] LE MONITEUR.FR, Publié le 03/07/09, Retrieved January 7. 2016. (fr)&lt;/ref&gt;

He published the first article in the architecture journal ''Bauen + Wohnen'' in 1957, titled "Real model photograph as a new representation method in architecture planning" (''Reale Modellphotographie als neue Darstellungsmethode in der Architekturplanung'').&lt;ref&gt;Martin Schulz van Treeck: ''Reale Modellphotographie als neue Darstellungsmethode in der Architekturplanung'', Bauen + Wohnen, 1957, pp. 332—334.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[architectural design competition]]s, it is common that a 1:500 scale model of the building is shown in addition to the plans during the presentation. These models are usually seen and photographed from a [[bird's-eye view]]. Van Treeck was aware of the problem to mediate architectural design to builders and investors, when seen from the traditional bird's-eye perspective. His idea was to use the endoscope photos as base for drawings of the model and present these to clients or the public, to show what the building would look like if they were walking or driving in the street next to it. He could place the endoscope in a pedestrian's position in the model. Architectural models in 1:500 or 1:100 scale were represented in photos, and later in videos, the way a pedestrian would see the finished building.&lt;ref name=Darstellung &gt;Martin Schulz van Treeck: ''Möglichkeiten der ''Darstellung'' und Abklärung architektonischer Projekte'', in DETAIL, Verlag Architektur + Baudetail GmbH, München, 1974, Nr. 4 Juli – August, pp. 635–642.&lt;/ref&gt;

The endoscope became known among architects and builders through its use by van Treeck in the [[Urban planning|planning]] of the [[Orgues de Flandre]] residential buildings on Avenue de Flandre, [[19th arrondissement of Paris|19th arrondissement]] in Paris. The four central residential towers of the settlement have different heights and are designed in the shape of [[organ pipe]]s. They are called ''Prelude'', ''Fugue'', ''Cantata'' and ''4'', which explains the name ''Orgues de Flandre'' ("Church organs of Flanders").&lt;ref Name=invention &gt;''Orgues de Flandre'' [http://www.lemoniteur.fr/article/l-''invention''-de-la-tour-europeenne-13-30-les-orgues-de-flandre-1976-paris-754715]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Relatoscope &gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/colan_0336-1500_1974_num_23_1_4130 ''Relatoscope'', ''Orgues de Flandre'', Martin S. van Treeck]&lt;/ref&gt; Van Treeck used an endoscope for photography and especially video films, on models in a 1:500 to 1:100 scale in the architectural competition and further planning of the ''Orgues de Flandre'' buildings. He documented his work using an endoscope from the beginning.

At the construction and architecture exhibition, ''Batimat'', November 1973 in Paris and ''Constructa'', February 1974 in Hannover, van Treeck and a company introduced the endoscope for the first time on a large scale to members of the international architecture and construction sector. In 1974, van Treeck described the endoscope and its uses for the ''Orgues de Flandre'' project, in an article in the German architecture magazine ''[[DETAIL (professional journal)|DETAIL]]''.&lt;ref name=Darstellung /&gt; A French article by François Loyer is available online as a PDF, and includes endoscope photos of the ''Orgues de Flandre'' project.&lt;ref Name=invention /&gt;&lt;ref name= Relatoscope /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;François Loyer: Pour bien lire une maquette d'architecture : le relatoscope, In: Communication et langages, 1974, Volume 23, Numéro 1, pp. 56-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
In 1974, after the presentation at the trade fairs and the articles in specialist magazines, the use of endoscopes was examined at international universities in the scope of research projects on urban planning. For example, architects and town planners such as urban designer [[Carl-Axel Acking]] from [[Lund]], Sweden; [[Donald Appleyard]] from [[Berkeley, California]], United States; [[Hendrik van Leeuwen]] from [[Wageningen]], Netherlands and [[Antero Markelin]] from [[Stuttgart]], Germany; early on explored the use of endoscopes. The focus of their research was the use of video films in urban planning. For experiments, the simulation equipment presented by van Treeck at the fairs was purchased and, because of low funding, "model simulation systems" were built by the institutes for less money. This was done at the [[University of Stuttgart|Urban Planning Institute of the University of Stuttgart]] where Antero Markelin taught and researched. The result of his two-year research in Stuttgart in 1975–1977, was published in 1979 in the book ''Environmental Simulation, sensory simulation in urban development'' (''Umweltsimulation, sensorische Simulation im Städtebau'').&lt;ref name="Umweltsimulation"&gt;Antero Markelin, Bernd Fahle Hrsg: ''Umweltsimulation, Sensorische Simulation im Städtebau'', Stuttgart, Krämer, 1979, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the first conference of the ''European Architectural Endoscopy Association'' (EAEA) in 1993 at the [[Tampere University of Technology]] in Finland, the ''Urban Simulator'' that the Tampere School of Architecture started to build in 1978 was demonstrated. The system as well as the computer control was primarily developed and built by the researchers at the school, because the existing financial resources were very small.&lt;ref name= Siitonen &gt;''Siitonen'', Petri: "Future of Endoscopy", in: Seppo Aura (et al.), Endoscopy as a Tool in Architecture. Tampere, 1993, pp. 181-184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cumincad.scix.net/cgi-bin/works/Show?cc06 Future of Endoscopy in Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt; Petri Siitonen at the Faculty of Architecture of [[Helsinki University of Technology]], spoke at the conference in his lecture ''The Future of Endoscopy'', about a comparison between the use of [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) and endoscope in works made by students. At that time, a study revealed that endoscopy got 27 points and CAD 20 points. He also mentioned that this would change in the years to come.&lt;ref name=Siitonen /&gt;

== European Architectural Endoscopy Association (EAEA) ==
The [[European Architectural Endoscopy Association]] (EAEA) was established in 1993. The founding meeting took place at a conference at the Institute of Architecture Technical University of Tampere in Finland. It was the first international conference at which experts from fifteen universities that conducted research and teaching in the field of visualization with endoscopes, presented their results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cumincad.architexturez.net/doc/10794 first conference in 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar conferences have been held every second year since then. The ninth conference was organized by the [[Brandenburg University of Technology|Faculty of Architecture of the Technical University of Cottbus-Senftenberg]] in 2009. At that conference, the participants agreed to change the name of the EAEA. Instead of ''endoscopy'', the word ''envisioning'' would henceforth be used by the association. {{As of|2015}}, their name is ''European Architectural Envisioning Association'' (EAEA). Thus, the rapid development of computer hardware and software for visualization of construction projects, from single-family homes to urban planning, was included.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tudelft-architecture.nl/chairs/form-modelling-studies/research/eaea2011-conference From Conference 9 to Conference 10 – From Endoscopy to Envisioning]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lodz University of Technology]] (TUL) hosted the 12th EAEA conference in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eaea12-2015.p.lodz.pl/ Konferenz EAEA 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Plans for conferences in [[Istanbul]], Turkey and [[Montana]] in 2016 and in [[Glasgow]], Scotland in 2017, were started in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wit.edu/news/2015/11/2015-11-25-staff-faculty.html Conferences for 2016 and 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The EAEA conferences are held each odd-numbered year.

In addition to funded research projects at universities, endoscopes have been used by photographers and videographers in studios since 1974, in works for architecture and advertising clients. As special optical instruments, endoscopes became part of the photographic or video equipment in photo studios. For example, in Germany, they were used since 1974 for visual examination of models in Ingo Wende's studio in [[Berlin]], and since 1975 by [[Alex Kempkens]] in [[Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingo Wende: Modellsimulation, in Baumeister, München, 1/1981, pp. 58 – 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doris Schmidt: ''Warten auf den Start.'' In: ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', Nr. 294 vom 18./19. Dezember 1976, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Assignments from architects and builders were generally to take pictures of their models with [[Large format (photography)|large format camera]]s and endoscopes. Short films were produced as [[video]]s or [[16 mm film]]. The films were generally used on larger urban projects for public relations and public information.&lt;ref name="Umweltsimulation" /&gt; {{As of|2015}}, only a few photo studios working with endoscope photography still exists.

== Criticism ==
[[File:Orgues de Flandre - Paris - Martin Schulz van Treeck, Photo Maxim Pouska.jpg|thumb|Orgues de Flandre, Paris, by architect Martin Schulz van Treeck, 2016]]

Van Treeck wrote about the fact that, with an endoscope, a model is photographed from normal eye level.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Schulz van Treeck: ''Möglichkeiten der Darstellung und Abklärung architektonischer Projekte'', in DETAIL, Verlag Architektur + Baudetail GmbH, München, 1974, Nr. 4 Juli – August, pp. 636, 642.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The sense of Relatoskopie lies in adjusting the view of the observer to the scale of the architecture model, and bring it inside the model at the usual human eye level. ... When comparing reality with simulation through a scale model reality, the credibility of Relatoskopie is proven. The transfer is not illusory, but it brings the essential information regarding the body of the building and its spatial organization forth."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The opponents of controversial construction projects were never convinced, and they criticize the method. Their main critique was that the pictures were photographed from an [[ant]]'s perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Kirchenhofer: ''Ansichten aus der Ameisenperspektive'', ZEITmagazin, München, 1980, Nr. 23, pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; The eye level of a {{convert|170|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} person is approximately {{convert|160|cm|ftin|abbr=on}}. In a 1:100 scale, the eye level of a pedestrian in a model is at {{convert|16|mm|in|abbr=on}} and this level can be precisely maintained with an endoscope, which preferably has a diameter of {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}}.

== Working with endoscopes ==
To achieve higher quality photographs or films, rigid endoscopes were more suitable because of the quality of the images. An example of this was the [[Endoscopy#Rod-lens endoscopes|rod-lens endoscope]] invented by [[Harold Hopkins (physicist)|Harold Hopkins]]. The more flexible [[Optical fiber|fiber-optic]] endoscope, called [[fiberscope]] or flexoscope, made from bundled glass fibers do not produce the same quality pictures.

From the start, rigid endoscopes were used for direct viewing, photography, video and film in environmental simulation and for interior and exterior shots of models. Endoscopes used for industrial applications, called [[borescope]]s, were basically the same as those used in architecture. Specially developed borescopes were used temporarily in model visualization. Video and film needed strong light and lamps and spotlights with high wattages were required. In professional photo studios, powerful flash units were used. Light emitted from optical fiber systems, which was used in the medicine, was seldom used for architectural models.

The model simulation system presented by van Treek at trade fairs required the endoscope, connected to a video camera or a camera, to be mounted vertically above the model. This was necessary because the viewing angle of the optic was 90 degrees sideways. The system was complex and expensive.&lt;ref&gt;Antero Markelin, Bernd Fahle Hrsg.: Umweltsimulation, sensorische Simulation im Städtebau, Stuttgart, Krämer, 1979, pp. 74–81, 131.&lt;/ref&gt; When used for photography, endoscopes with different viewing angles could be used, and because of this the camera did not have to be in a vertical position above the model.

== Model visualization before and after 1995 ==
Starting in the early 1960s, research has been done and published on the use of computers in architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Barnett: ''Will the Computer Change the Practice of Architecture?'' In: Architectural Record, January 1965, McGraw-Hill, pp. 143–150&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1995, visualization of a model as a computer image or a [[computer animation]] was so complex and expensive that it was rarely an alternative to the less costly endoscope photography or short film. Exceptions were made for prestigious projects, such as in 1984, when a computer model was made of the [[Louvre Pyramid|glass pyramid]] for the modernization of the [[Louvre]] by architect [[I. M. Pei|Ieoh Ming Pei]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic30775.files/3-5_Louvre.pdf] HARVARD DESIGN SCHOOL CDI: THE GRAND LOUVRE.&lt;/ref&gt;

At move of the Tampere School of Architecture in 1995, the 20 year old "Urban Simulator" was replaced by a modern endoscope system. The latest endoscopes, components and computers were installed for camera control, image processing, and modern computing methods. The new laboratory was presented at the 1997 Conference of EAEA at the [[Delft University of Technology]], Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cumincad.architexturez.net/doc/oai-cumincadworks.id-0e8f Developing a new endoscopy laboratory with digital tools]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2015}}, endoscope technology for visualization of architectural models is only offered at a few universities in the context of education and research. This is now done parallel with [[architectural animation]] [[2D computer graphics|2D]], [[3D computer graphics|3D]] and [[Virtual reality|VR]] simulation.&lt;ref&gt;Ryuzo OHNO, [http://www.enveng.titech.ac.jp/ohno/simulation_methods-e.html ''SIMULATION METHODS''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070109/http://www.enveng.titech.ac.jp/ohno/simulation_methods-e.html |date=March 4, 2016 }}, Tokyo Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of technology in computers, lighting, software, wireless data transmission, [[Charge-coupled device|CCD-Sensors]], [[Endoscopy|Videoendoscope]] and more, was so rapid in the decades following 1995, that an architecture student in the 2010s can barely imagine how laborious model simulation and visualization was earlier. The development of endoscopes also benefited from the new technology during those years. An example of this development is the Urban Simulation Laboratory at the [[Polytechnic University of Milan]], (DIAP), which was founded in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emma.polimi.it/emma/showEvent.do?page%3D2100%26idEvent%3D60 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305225546/http://emma.polimi.it/emma/showEvent.do?page=2100&amp;idEvent=60 |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }} the Urban Simulation Laboratory at the Politecnico di Milano&lt;/ref&gt; At the EAEA Conference in Milan in 2013, a demonstration was made of a mini car with a micro-camera that could go into a model street, {{convert|2.2|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, to record a video from the eye-level perspective in the car. The images were transmitted directly to a screen. The mini car was moved by hand through the city model. The earlier elaborate technical design for video recording was no longer necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eaea11-2013.polimi.it/ 2013 EAEA Mailand] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160224110127/http://www.eaea11-2013.polimi.it/ |date=February 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2rxqB5dDpQ&amp;list=PL204DE54BAD787951&amp;index=3 Endoscopy Architectural MicroCar]&lt;/ref&gt;

Genuine models that can be touched and examined from all angles, will continue to be built. They will be made for education and to meet clients demands as well as for presentation of projects at international property and investment trade fairs in Europe and worldwide. There are still models that can be viewed from a bird's-eye view in exhibition halls, such as the [[Expo Real]], [[Munich]] or the [[MIPIM]] in [[Palais des Festivals et des Congrès]], [[Cannes]], France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exporeal.net/messe/messeprofil/ EXPO REAL, München]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mipim.com/ MIPIM, Cannes]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Renaissance of endoscopy ==
At the EAEA Conference 1993 in Tampere Bob Martens said: "A renaissance of endoscopy could thus be envisaged at least for still pictures". He also worked with 3D computer simulation but said that endoscopy continues to have advantages in the training of students: "Endoscopy is not overloaded with theory; Students can tackle the subject in a playful manner ".&lt;ref name=martens&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martens|first1=Bob|title=A Renaissance of architectural endoscopy?|url=http://info.tuwien.ac.at/eaea/Renaissance/rae.html|website=www.tuwien.ac.at|publisher=[[Vienna University of Technology ]]|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He could not foresee the technical development plus the cost reduction in the decades following his presentation. In the summer of 2015, two of the largest retail chains in Germany sold [[videoscope]] cameras for €60 as "men's toys". At the present, it is even possible for students to create their own video with endoscopes to visualize their models for a presentation at the end of the semester. Rigid endoscopes and related photographic equipment have also become affordable. The reduction of costs for the use of endoscopes supports the thesis of Bob Martens, that it may 'come to a' 'Renaissance of endoscopy'.&lt;ref name=martens /&gt;

== Reception ==
Martin Schulz van Treeck's idea in 1954, was about the eye-level perspective of the pedestrian and the need to convey the concept of the design to clients and the citizens. At the time, an endoscope was the only tool available to photograph and film architectural models from this perspective. The digital revolution was in its infancy and had not yet developed tools ([[Computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]]) sufficiently to realize his idea. Since then, decades have passed and with computers the eye-level perspective of a pedestrian can be visualized as a photo or a movie without difficulty. The endoscope of yesteryear has been supplemented in the digital age by new technologies, establishing van Treek's idea to present designs from the perspective of pedestrians.

The '''Bibliography of Music Literature''' ({{lang-de|Bibliographie des Musikschrifttums}}), also known as '''BMS''' or [http://www.musikbibliographie.de:80/LNG=EN/ '''BMS ''online'''''], is an international [[bibliography]] of literature on music. It considers all kind of music and includes both current and older literature. Since 1968, the BMS editorial  staff has been working as the German committee for [[RILM]], too.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rilm.org/globalNetwork/country.php?country=Germany RILM National Committee of Germany]&lt;/ref&gt; The bibliography includes [[monograph]]s, master’s theses and doctoral [[dissertation]]s, articles and reviews from journals, [[Festschrift]]en, [[Proceedings|conference proceedings]], [[yearbook]]s, [[Anthology|anthologies]], and essays from critical reports. It contains [[Printing|printed media]] as well as [[Electronic publishing|online resources]], data media, sound recordings, audiovisual media, and [[microform]]s. Each record provides the title in the original language (for [[Eastern Europe|East European]]- and [[Asia]]n entries a German translation is added), full bibliographic data, a keyword index, and mostly an [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]]. 
Currently, '''BMS ''online''''' has more than 315,000 [[Bibliographic record|records]] of literature on music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Musikverzeichnisse#Musikbibliographien Wikisource-Music directories]&lt;/ref&gt; It is supplemented by the [http://uri.gbv.de/database/olcssg-mus '''OLC-SSG Musicology'''], which incorporates the contents of some more 150 music journals from 1993 onward. '''BMS ''online''''' participates actively on [[Virtual Library of Musicology|ViFaMusik]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vifamusik.de/literature.html?L=1&amp;cHash=2d26cd0946314ea51422f6a01ed26e4d BMS ''online'' in the Virtual Library of Musicology]&lt;/ref&gt; the central gateway for music and musicology in Germany.

==Format==

'''BMS''' was established in 1936 by the [[State Institute for Music Research]] in Berlin with the aim to list literature on music from all over the world. It was published in print from 1936 through 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fiz1.fh-potsdam.de/volltext/diplome/05005.pdf Silvia C. E. Mai, ''Anforderung an eine Datenbank im SIM - Staatliches Institut für Musikforschung'', Berlin 2004, p. 4/ p. 11]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it is available as '''BMS ''online''''' in a [[Online database|cumulative online database]], which is updated in real-time.

==History==

Established in 1936, the '''BMS''' resumed the bibliographic surveys printed in the [https://archive.org/details/jahrbuchdermusi00petegoog '''Jahrbücher der Musikbibliothek Peters''']. The first '''BMS''' editor was [[Kurt Taut]], who was succeeded by [[Georg Karstädt]]. Originally printed by [[Friedrich Hofmeister Musikverlag|Friedrich Hofmeister]] in Leipzig (Leipzig: Hofmeister, 1936-1941 [volumes 1.1936 to 4.1939]), after a span of four years '''BMS''' was stopped due to wartime limitations. The commencement of this bibliographic enterprise after World War II is owed to the musicologist and librarian [[Wolfgang Schmieder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/musik/mushist.html Wolfgang Schmieder CV in the University Library of Frankfurt a. Main]&lt;/ref&gt; On behalf of the reconstituted [[State Institute for Music Research]] the first volume for 1950/51 appeared in 1954. Since that time the '''Bibliography of Music Literature''' has been a regular publication of the [[State Institute for Music Research|Staatliches Institut für Musikforschung]]. The last volume in print format was published in 2001 and covered the year 1988 (Frankfurt am Main: [[Friedrich Hofmeister Musikverlag|Hofmeister]], 1954-1968 [volumes 1.1950/51 to 6.1960], Mainz: [[Schott Music|Schott]], 1969-2001 [volumes 1961 to 1988]). Since 2006, there has been the '''Bibliography of Music Literature''' as '''BMS ''online'''''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3423">A '''biological pathway''' is a series of interactions among molecules in a cell that leads to a certain product or a change in a cell. Such a pathway can trigger the assembly of new molecules, such as a fat or   protein. Pathways can also turn genes on and off, or spur a cell to move.&lt;ref name=g&gt;http://www.genome.gov/27530687&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most common biological pathways are involved in [[metabolism]], the [[regulation of gene expression]] and the [[Cell signaling|transmission of signals]]. Pathways play a key role in advanced studies of [[genomics]].

Most common types of biological pathways:&lt;ref name=g/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10380">[[File:Location TsugaruPeninsulaJp.jpg|thumb|The Tsugaru Strait which forms the natural [[biogeography|zoogeographical]] boundary of Blakiston's Line]]

The '''Blakiston Line''' or '''Blakiston's Line''' is a [[wikt:faunal|faunal]] boundary line drawn between two of the four largest [[island]]s of [[Japan]]: [[Hokkaidō]] in the north and [[Honshū]], south of it. It can be compared with faunal boundary lines like the [[Wallace Line]]. Certain animal species can only be found north of Blakiston's Line, while certain other species can only be found south of it.

[[Thomas Blakiston]], who lived in Japan from 1861 to 1884 and who spent much of that time in [[Hakodate]], Hokkaido, was the first person to notice that animals in [[Hokkaidō]], Japan's northern island, were related to northern [[Asia]]n species, whereas those on [[Honshū]] to the south were related to those from [[southern Asia]]. The [[Tsugaru Strait]] between the two islands was therefore established as a [[biogeography|zoogeographical]] boundary, and became known as ''Blakiston's Line''. This finding was first published to the [[Asiatic Society of Japan]] in a paper of 14 February 1883, named ''Zoological Indications of Ancient Connection of the Japan islands with the Continent''.&lt;ref&gt;Collection Writings of Sir Hugh Cortazzi, Volume II, Sir Hugh Cortazzi, Routledge, Oxon, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanations and Hypotheses on the existence of Blakiston's Line ==
[[File:Japan glaciation.gif|thumb|right|Japanese archipelago, possibly 10,000-20,000 years ago with Hokkaido island bridged to the mainland, the thin black line indicates present-day shorelines.]]
The difference in the fauna can probably be attributed to land bridges that may have existed in the past. Whilst Hokkaido may have had [[land bridge]]s to the north of Asia, via [[Sakhalin]] and the [[Kuril Islands]], the other islands of Japan like [[Honshu]], [[Shikoku]] and [[Kyushu]], may have been connected to the Asian continent via the [[Korean Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/japan/hokkaido/background/other-features/18ee2039-f6f7-4c73-89a1-c742c4086f49/a/nar/18ee2039-f6f7-4c73-89a1-c742c4086f49/1323400|title=The Blakiston Line in Hokkaidō|last=Planet|first=Lonely|work=Lonely Planet|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As to when these land bridges existed, scientists do not agree with each other. It may have been between 26,000 and 18,000 years ago, it may have been later than that.&lt;ref&gt;Effects of climate, distance, and a geographic barrier on ectomycorrhizal fugal communities in Japan: A comparison across Blakiston's Line by Yumiko Miyamoto, Maki Narimatsu and Kazuhide Nara, Hokkaido University January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A new timeframe for the diversification of Japan’s mammals by Bailey D. McKay, Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Hoboken 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Sakhalin, the island just north of Japan, and Hokkaido may even have been connected to the mainland as recently as 10,000 years ago or less.&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, M. (1994), Patterns of distribution in Japanese land mammals. Mammal Review, 24: 91-111.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from these former land bridges, there are more factors that play a role in why there is a difference in the fauna north and south of the line:
* The Tsugaru Strait is relatively deep, the maximum depth is 449 m.
* The narrowest part of the Tsugaru Strait is 12.1 miles (19.5 km).
* Currents in the Tsugaru Strait are strong, tidal currents coincide with ocean currents&lt;ref&gt;EFFECTS OF WAVE, TIDAL CURRENT AND OCEAN CURRENT COEXISTENCE ON THE WAVE AND CURRENT PREDICTIONS IN THE TSUGARU STRAIT, Ayumi Saruwatari, Yoshihiro Yoneko and Yu Tajima&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conlon, Dennis Michael, "Dynamics of Flow in the Region of the Tsugaru Strait." (1980).  LSU Historical Dissertations and Theses. 3557.  https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/gradschool_disstheses/3557&lt;/ref&gt;
* The climate in the north is generally far colder than that in the south.

Note that species that can only be found on the [[Ryukyu Islands]] are excluded from this table, even though their habitat is clearly south of Blakiston's Line, as other factors account for their distribution. Besides animal species that can only be found either north or south of Blakiston's Line, there are very many that can be found at either side of the line, in part because of human involvement. Examples of the latter are the [[Japanese Shorthorn]], a breed of small Japanese beef cattle that is distributed in northern Honshu and also in Hokkaido, and the [[Japanese weasel]], which was introduced to Hokkaido by human intervention.

It has also been studied whether or not this biogeographic boundary applies to far smaller organisms like soil microbes.&lt;ref&gt;Effects of climate, distance, and a geographic barrier on ectomycorrhizal fugal communities in Japan: A comparison across Blakiston's Line by Yumiko Miyamoto, Maki Narimatsu and Kazuhide Nara, Hokkaido University January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Faunal Boundary Lines in Japan ==
Apart from Blakiston's Line, other faunal boundary lines have been proposed for Japan, like [[Watase’s line]] ([[Tokara   Straits]]): for   mammals,   reptiles,   amphibians   and   spiders, [[Hatta’s line]] (Soya line): for reptiles, amphibians and freshwater invertebrates, [[Hachisuka’s line]] for birds and [[Miyake’s line]] for insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Nature in Japan | publisher = Ministry of the Environment Government of Japan | url = http://www.env.go.jp/earth/coop/coop/materials/08-ttmnce/08-ttmnce-21.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The role of Thomas Blakiston ==
[[File:Tsugaru street detail.PNG|thumb|More detailed map of the Tsugaru Strait]]
There has been speculation about why Blakiston was the person who discovered this faunal boundary line and no one before him had done so. Andrew Davis, who has been a professor at [[Hokkaido University]] for four years, argued that this may have been because of his unusual position in Japanese society as a European''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.japansociety.org.uk/6873/a-line-in-birdsthomas-w-blakistons-contribution-to-ornithology-and-biogeography-in-early-meiji-japan-by-andrew-davis/|title=A Line in Birds:Thomas W Blakiston's contribution to Ornithology and Biogeography in Early-Meiji Japan by Andrew Davis - Japan Society of the UK|date=2009-10-28|work=Japan Society of the UK|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blakiston spent much time researching bird species in Japan. At that time, Japanese ornithology was at its infancy. In 1886 [[Leonhard Stejneger]] remarked: "Our knowledge of Japanese ornithology is only fragmentary"&lt;ref&gt;Review of Japanese Birds in Proceedings of United States National Museum by Leonhard Stejneger, Washington 1886.&lt;/ref&gt; The years after his stay in Japan, Blakiston made publications on birds in Japan in general&lt;ref&gt;A Catalogue of the Birds of Japan by T. Blakiston and H. Pryer, Ibis International Journey of Avian Science, Fourth Series, No. VII. July 1878&lt;/ref&gt; and on water birds of Japan in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Water-birds of Japan in Proceedings of United States National Museum by T.W. Blakiston, Washington 1885&lt;/ref&gt; Bird species like [[Blakiston's fish owl|Blakiston's Fish Owl]] (''Bubo blakistoni'') and ''Regulus regulus japonensis'' Blakiston have been named after him. In Hakodate, Blakiston made a large collection of birds, which is currently located at the museum of Hakodate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Blakiston|first=Herbert Edward Douglas|title=Blakiston Thomas Wright|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Blakiston,_Thomas_Wright_(DNB01)|work=Dictionary of National Biography, 1901 supplement|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distributions of many [[bird]] species observe the Blakiston line, since many birds do not cross even the shortest stretches of open ocean water. 

For his discovery of Blakiston's Line, a monument was erected in his honor on [[Mount Hakodate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nihon-kankou.or.jp.e.wp.hp.transer.com/hokkaido/012025/detail/01202aj2200023170|title=Monument of Blakiston {{!}} Must-see-japan Hakodate-shi (Japanese sightseeing promotion association) of the whole country|website=www.nihon-kankou.or.jp.e.wp.hp.transer.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zipangguide.com/travel/sight/hokkaido/hakodateyama_tenbodai.html|title=Mount Hakodate Observatory - Zipang Guide|website=Zipang Guide|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bremen Institute for Applied Beam Technology''' (German: Bremer Institut für angewandte Strahltechnik) is a private sector research institute, located in the city of [[Bremen]], [[Germany]]. It was founded on July 1, 1977 as a premier laser institute, which was not a part of a university. It was the first of its kind, during that time. The institute was founded by [[:de:Werner Jüptner|Werner Jüptner]] and Gerd Sepold.

==Areas of Research==
The institute focuses its research in the areas of Material Processing and Opto-electronic Systems and Optical Metrology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bias.de&lt;/ref&gt; The departments within the institute are accordingly categorised.
* Materials and modelling
* Optical metrology and testing
* Welding and surface technology
* Industrial applications

==Location==
The institute is located in the [[University of Bremen]]'s campus. It can be conveniently reached via the [[Tram|Straßenbahn]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bsag.de&lt;/ref&gt; number 6, alighting at the stop named 'Klagenfurter Straße'. It is about 15 mins via the Straßenbahn to the city centre and 35 mins to the [[Bremen Airport|airport]].

The '''Center for Nanotechnology in Society''' at the [[University of California at Santa Barbara]] (CNS-UCSB) is funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] and "serves as a national research and education center, a network hub among researchers and educators concerned with societal issues concerning nanotechnologies, and a resource base for studying these issues in the US and abroad." The CNS-UCSB began its operations in January 2006.&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://www.cns.ucsb.edu/about "About CNS–UCSB"] Center for Nanotechnology in Society, accessed May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guston|first1=David H.|title=Encyclopedia of Nanoscience and Society|date=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=1452266174|pages=80–82|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vyp1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nanotechnology]] (sometimes shortened to nanotech or nano) is the study of manipulating matter on an [[atom]]ic and [[molecular]] scale. Generally, nanotechnology deals with structures sized between 1 and 100 [[nanometre]] in at least one dimension, and involves developing materials or devices possessing at least one dimension within that size. [[quantum mechanics|Quantum mechanical]] effects are very important at this scale,  which is in the [[quantum realm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=BJIOBN00000200000400MR17000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=Yes|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120703014917/http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=BJIOBN00000200000400MR17000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=Yes|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-03|author1=Cristina Buzea |author2=Ivan Pacheco |author3=Kevin Robbie |title=Nanomaterials and Nanoparticles: Sources and Toxicity|volume=2|year=2007|journal=Biointerphases|doi=10.1116/1.2815690|pmid=20419892|issue=4|pages=MR17–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CNS-UCSB looks at the societal implications of nano, including governance, economics, technological development, potential environmental and health risks ([[risk perception]]), and "social risks" such as distribution of benefits.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt;

== History ==

The Center received its first five years of funding from the [[U.S. National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt; The Center aims to disseminate both its technological and social scientific findings on [[Nanoscopic scale|nanoscale science]] to policymakers and those outside the nano field, and to facilitate broader public participation in the nanotechnological enterprise. It does this through public engagement between academic researchers with regulators, educators, industrial scientists, and policy makers, as well as community-based organizations and [[NGO]]s. The Center’s education and outreach programs include students and people outside the nanotech field.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

== Focus ==

The Center has three main areas of research:&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt;

#the historical context of the nano-enterprise;
#innovation processes and global diffusion of nanotech;
#risk perception and the public sphere.

== Partnerships ==

CNS–UCSB researchers collaborate with the [[California NanoSystems Institute]], [[UC Santa Cruz]], [[UC Berkeley]], the [[Science History Institute]] (formerly the Chemical Heritage Foundation), [[Duke University]], [[Rice University]], [[SUNY]] Levin Institute, and SUNY New Paltz in the US, and [[Cardiff University]], UK, [[University of British Columbia]], Canada, [[University of Edinburgh]], UK, [[University of East Anglia]], UK, as well as institutes and centers in China and East Asia.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

'''Cognitive neuropsychiatry''' is a growing multidisciplinary field arising out of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[neuropsychiatry]] that aims to understand [[mental illness]] and [[psychopathology]] in terms of models of normal psychological function. A concern with the neural substrates of
impaired cognitive mechanisms links cognitive neuropsychiatry to the basic neuroscience. Alternatively, CNP provides a way of uncovering normal psychological processes by studying the effects of their change or impairment.

The term "cognitive neuropsychiatry" was coined by [[Hadyn Ellis|Prof Hadyn Ellis]] ([[Cardiff University]] ) in a paper "The cognitive neuropsychiatric origins of the Capgras delusion", presented at the International Symposium on the Neuropsychology of Schizophrenia, Institute of Psychiatry, London (Coltheart, 2007).

Although clinically useful, current syndrome classifications (e.g. DSM-IV; ICD-10) have no empirical basis as models of normal cognitive processes. No neuropsychological accounts of how the brain 'works' would ever be complete without a cognitive level of analysis. CNP moves beyond diagnosis and classification to offer a cognitive explanation for established psychiatric behaviours, regardless of whether the symptoms are due to recognised brain pathology or to dysfunction in brain areas or networks without structural lesions.

CNP has been influential, not least because of its early success in explaining some previously bizarre  psychiatric delusions, most notably the [[Capgras delusion]], [[Fregoli delusion]] and other [[delusional misidentification syndrome]]s. The Capgras delusion is "explained as the interruption in the covert route to face recognition, namely affective responses to familiar stimuli, localized in the dorsal route of vision from striate cortex to limbic system. According to standard molecular hypotheses, acute delusions are the result of a dysregulated activity of some neuromodulators."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sirgiovanni|first1=Elisabetta|title=Mechanistic Approach to Psychiatric Classification|journal=Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences|date=2009|volume=2|issue=2|pages=45–49|url=http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-C09-02.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the study of cognitive neuropsychiatry has shown to intersect with the study of philosophy. This intersection revolves around a reconsideration of the mind-body relationship and the contemplation of moral issues that can arise by fields such as neuropsychopathology. For example, it has been under consideration whether or not Parkinson's patients should be held morally accountable for their physical actions. This discussion and study has taken place due to the discovery that under certain circumstances, Parkinson's patients can initiate and control their own movement. Examples such as this are cause for difficult judgement calls, i.e. "about who is mad and who is bad" (Stein 1999). Cognitive neuropsychiatry has also explored the difference between implicit and explicit cognition, especially in catatonic patients. For more information on the bridge between neuropsychiatry and philosophy see (e.g., Stein, Dan (1999). Philosophy, Psychiatry, &amp; Psychology).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4057">The '''Collingridge dilemma''' is a methodological quandary in which efforts to influence&lt;!--/contribute to--&gt; or control the further development&lt;!--/impact/..--&gt; of technology face a [[double bind|double-bind problem]]:
* An information problem: impacts cannot be easily predicted until the technology is extensively developed and widely used.
* A [[Power (philosophy)|power]] problem: control or change is difficult when the technology has become entrenched.
The idea was coined by David Collingridge, The [[University of Aston]], Technology Policy Unit, in his 1980 book ''The Social Control of Technology''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Social Control of Technology'' (New York: St. Martin's Press; London: Pinter) {{ISBN|0-312-73168-X}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The dilemma is a basic point of reference in [[technology assessment]] debates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itas.fzk.de/tatup/092/boeh09a.htm Article] by K. Böhle in TATuP, September 2009, pp. 121-125 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

In "This Explains Everything," edited by [[John Brockman (literary agent)|John Brockman]], technology critic [[Evgeny Morozov]] explains Collingridge's idea by quoting Collingridge himself: "When change is easy, the need for it cannot be foreseen; when the need for change is apparent, change has become expensive, difficult, and time-consuming." &lt;ref&gt;"This Explains Everything" (Harper Perennial, 2013, p.255, {{ISBN|0062230174}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Pacing Problem, the Collingridge Dilemma &amp; [[Technological Determinism]]" by [[Adam Thierer]], a senior research fellow at the [[Mercatus Center]] at [[George Mason University]], the Collingridge dilemma is related to the "pacing problem" in technology regulation. The "pacing problem" refers to the notion that technological innovation is increasingly outpacing the ability of laws and regulations to keep up, first explained in [[Larry Downes]]' 2009 book ''[[The Laws of Disruption]]'', in which he famously states that "technology changes exponentially, but social, economic, and legal systems change incrementally". In Thierer's essay, he tries to correlate these two concepts by saying that "the 'Collingridge dilemma' is simply a restatement of the pacing problem but with greater stress on the social drivers behind the pacing problem and an implicit solution to 'the problem' in the form of preemptive control of new technologies while they are still young and more manageable."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techliberation.com/2018/08/16/the-pacing-problem-the-collingridge-dilemma-technological-determinism/|title=The Pacing Problem, the Collingridge Dilemma &amp; Technological Determinism|date=2018-08-16|work=Technology Liberation Front|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely-adopted solution to Collingridge dilemma is the "[[Precautionary principle|Precautionary Principle]]", the belief that new innovations should not be embraced "until their developers can prove that they will not cause any harm to individuals, groups, specific entities, cultural norms, or various existing laws, norms, or traditions".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If they fail to do so, this innovation should be "prohibited, curtailed, modified, junked, or ignored". &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=What technology wants|last=Kelly|first=Kevin|publisher=Viking Press|year=2010|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach received criticisms from technology critics like [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] who believe the contour of such principle is ill-defined&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and such principle is biased against anything new because it drastically elevates threshold for anything innovative. According to American philosopher [[Max More]], the Precautionary Principle "is very good for one thing—stopping technological progress...not because it leads in bad directions, but because it leads in no direction at all."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Common and special causes''' are the two distinct origins of variation in a process, as defined in the statistical thinking and methods of [[Walter A. Shewhart]] and [[W. Edwards Deming]]. Briefly, "common causes", also called '''natural patterns''', are the usual, historical, quantifiable variation in a system, while "special causes" are unusual, not previously observed, non-quantifiable variation.

The distinction is fundamental in [[philosophy of statistics]] and [[philosophy of probability]], with different treatment of these issues being a classic issue of [[probability interpretations]], being recognised and discussed as early as 1703 by [[Gottfried Leibniz]]; various alternative names have been used over the years.

The distinction has been particularly important in the thinking of economists [[Frank Knight]], [[John Maynard Keynes]] and [[G. L. S. Shackle]].

==Origins and concepts==

In 1703, [[Jacob Bernoulli]] wrote to [[Gottfried Leibniz]] to discuss their shared interest in applying [[mathematics]] and [[probability]] to games of chance. [[Jacob Bernoulli|Bernoulli]] speculated whether it would be possible to gather [[Mortality rate|mortality]] data from gravestones and thereby calculate, by their existing practice, the probability of a man currently aged 20 years outliving a man aged 60 years. [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] replied that he doubted this was possible:

''Nature has established patterns originating in the return of events but only for the most part. New illnesses flood the human race, so that no matter how many experiments you have done on corpses, you have not thereby imposed a limit on the nature of events so that in the future they could not vary.''

This captures the central idea that some variation is predictable, at least approximately in frequency. This ''common-cause variation'' is evident from the experience base. However, new, unanticipated, emergent or previously neglected phenomena (e.g. "new diseases") result in variation outside the historical experience base. [[Walter A. Shewhart|Shewhart]] and [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]] argued that such ''special-cause variation'' is fundamentally unpredictable in frequency of occurrence or in severity.

[[John Maynard Keynes]] emphasised the importance of special-cause variation when he wrote:

''By "uncertain" knowledge ... I do not mean merely to distinguish what is known for certain from what is only probable. The game of roulette is not subject, in this sense, to uncertainty ... The sense in which I am using the term is that in which the prospect of a European war is uncertain, or the price of copper and the rate of interest twenty years hence, or the obsolescence of a new invention ... About these matters there is no scientific basis on which to form any calculable probability whatever. We simply do not know!''

==Definitions==

===Common-cause variations===
Common-cause variation is characterised by:{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

*Phenomena constantly active within the system;
*Variation predictable [[probability|probabilistically]];
*Irregular variation within a historical experience base; and
*Lack of significance in individual high or low values.

The outcomes of a perfectly balanced [[roulette]] wheel are a good example of common-cause variation. Common-cause variation is the ''noise'' within the system.

[[Walter A. Shewhart]] originally used the term ''chance cause''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''common cause'' was coined by [[Harry Alpert]] in 1947.  The [[Western Electric Company]] used the term ''natural pattern''.&lt;ref name="Western Electric Company 1956, 23–24"&gt;{{cite document

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shewhart called a process that features only common-cause variation as being ''in [[statistical control]]''. This term is deprecated by some modern statisticians who prefer the phrase ''stable and predictable''.

===Special-cause variation===

Special-cause variation is characterised by:{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

*New, unanticipated, emergent or previously neglected phenomena within the system;
*Variation inherently unpredictable, even probabilistically;
*Variation outside the historical experience base; and
*Evidence of some inherent change in the system or our knowledge of it.

Special-cause variation always arrives as a surprise. It is the ''signal'' within a system.

Walter A. Shewhart originally used the term ''assignable cause''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document

==Importance to economics==
{{details|Knightian uncertainty}}
In economics, this circle of ideas is analysed under the rubric of "[[Knightian uncertainty]]". [[John Maynard Keynes]] and [[Frank Knight]] both discussed the inherent unpredictability of economic systems in their work and used it to criticise the mathematical approach to economics, in terms of [[expected utility]], developed by [[Ludwig von Mises]] and others. Keynes in particular argued that economic systems did not automatically tend to the equilibrium of [[full employment]] owing to their agents' inability to predict the future. As he remarked in ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'':

''... as living and moving beings, we are forced to act ... [even when] our existing knowledge does not provide a sufficient basis for a calculated mathematical expectation.''

Keynes' thinking was at odds with the [[classical liberalism]] of the [[Austrian School]] of economists, but [[G. L. S. Shackle]] recognised the importance of Keynes's insight and sought to formalise it within a [[free-market]] philosophy.

In [[financial economics]], the [[black swan theory]] of [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] is based on the significance and unpredictability of special causes.

==Importance to industrial and quality management==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}

A special-cause failure is a failure that can be corrected by changing a component or process, whereas a common-cause failure is equivalent to noise in the system and specific actions cannot be made to prevent the failure.

[[Harry Alpert]] observed:{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

: ''A riot occurs in a certain prison. Officials and sociologists turn out a detailed report about the prison, with a full explanation of why and how it happened here, ignoring the fact that the causes were common to a majority of prisons, and that the riot could have happened anywhere.''

The quote recognises that there is a temptation to react to an extreme outcome and to see it as significant, even where its causes are common to many situations and the distinctive circumstances surrounding its occurrence, the results of mere chance. Such behaviour has many implications within management, often leading to ad hoc interventions that merely increase the level of variation and frequency of undesirable outcomes.

[[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]] and [[Walter A. Shewhart|Shewhart]] both advocated the [[control chart]] as a means of managing a [[business process]] in an economically efficient manner.

==Importance to statistics==

===Deming and Shewhart===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}

Within the [[frequency probability]] framework, there is no process whereby a [[probability]] can be attached to the future occurrence of special cause.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} One might naively ask whether the [[bayesian probability|Bayesian]] approach does allow such a probability to be specified. The existence of special-cause variation led [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]] and [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]] to an interest in [[Bayesian probability]], but no formal synthesis emerged from their work. Most statisticians of the Shewhart-Deming school take the view that special causes are not embedded in either experience or in current thinking (that's why they come as a surprise; their prior probability has been neglected—in effect, assigned the value zero) so that any subjective probability is doomed to be hopelessly badly [[calibration (probability)|calibrated]] in practice.

It is immediately apparent from the [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] quote above that there are implications for [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]]. Deming observed that in any forecasting activity, the [[population (statistics)|population]] is that of future events while the [[sampling frame]] is, inevitably, some [[subset]] of historical events. Deming held that the disjoint nature of population and sampling frame was inherently problematic once the existence of special-cause variation was admitted, rejecting the general use of probability and conventional statistics in such
situations. He articulated the difficulty as the distinction between [[analytic and enumerative statistical studies]].

[[Walter A. Shewhart|Shewhart]] argued that, as processes subject to special-cause variation were inherently unpredictable, the usual techniques of probability could not be used to separate special-cause from common-cause variation. He developed the [[control chart]] as a statistical [[heuristic]] to distinguish the two types of variation. Both Deming and [[Walter A. Shewhart|Shewhart]] advocated the control chart as a means of assessing a process's state of [[statistical control]] and as a foundation for forecasting.

===Keynes===

[[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]] identified three domains of probability:&lt;ref name=keynes1921&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keynes|first1=J. M.|year=1921|title=[[A Treatise on Probability]]|isbn=0-333-10733-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[frequency]] probability;
*subjective or [[Bayesian probability]]; and
*events lying outside the possibility of any description in terms of probability (special causes)

and sought to base a [[probability theory]] thereon.

==Common mode failure in engineering==
{{OR section|date=February 2013}}

'''Common mode failure''' has a more specific meaning in engineering. It refers to events which are not [[statistics|statistically independent]].  Failures in multiple parts of a system may be caused by a single fault, particularly random failures due to environmental conditions or aging. An example is when all of the pumps for a fire sprinkler system are located in one room.  If the room becomes too hot for the pumps to operate, they will all fail at essentially the same time, from one cause (the heat in the room).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.safetyinengineering.com/FileUploads/CMF%20in%20high-integrity%20C&amp;I%20systems_1329414280_2.pdf | title=Common-Mode Failure Considerations in High-Integrity C&amp;I Systems | publisher=Safety in Engineering | date=February 2012 | accessdate=November 21, 2012 | author=Thomson, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is an electronic system wherein a fault in a power supply injects noise onto a supply line, causing failures in multiple subsystems.

This is particularly important in safety-critical systems using multiple [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundant]] channels. If the probability of failure in one subsystem is ''p'', then it would be expected that an ''N'' channel system would have a probability of failure of ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''N''.&lt;/sup&gt; However, in practice, the probability of failure is much higher because they are not statistically independent; for example [[ionizing radiation]] or [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI) may affect all the channels.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Randell|Randell, Brian]] ''Design Fault Tolerance'' in ''The Evolution of Fault-Tolerant Computing'', Avizienis, A.; Kopetz, H.; Laprie, J.-C. (eds.), pp. 251-270. Springer-Verlag, 1987. {{ISBN|3-211-81941-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''principle of redundancy'' states that, when events of failure of a component are statistically independent, the probabilities of their joint occurrence multiply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hissa.nist.gov/chissa/SEI_Framework/framework_16.html | title=SEI Framework: Fault Tolerance Mechanisms | publisher=NIST High Integrity Software Systems Assurance | work=Redundancy Management | date=March 30, 1995 | accessdate=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, for instance, if the probability of failure of a component of a system is one in one thousand per year, the probability of the joint failure of two of them is one in one million per year, provided that the two events are statistically independent.  This principle favors the strategy of the redundancy of components.  One place this strategy is implemented is in [[RAID 1]], where two hard disks store a computer's data redundantly.

But even so there can be many common modes: consider a RAID1 where two disks are purchased online and are installed in a computer, there can be many common modes:

* The disks are likely to be from the same manufacturer and of the same model, therefore they share the same design flaws.
* The disks are likely to have similar serial numbers, thus they may share any manufacturing flaws affecting production of the same batch.
* The disks are likely to have been shipped at the same time, thus they are likely to have suffered from the same transportation damage.
* As installed both disks are attached to the same power supply, making them vulnerable to the same power supply issues.
* As installed both disks are in the same case, making them vulnerable to the same overheating events.
* They will be both attached to the same card or motherboard, and driven by the same software, which may have the same bugs.
* Because of the very nature of RAID1, both disks will be subjected to the same workload and very closely similar access patterns, stressing them in the same way.

Also, if the events of failure of two components are maximally statistically dependent, the probability of the joint failure of both is identical to the probability of failure of them individually.  In such a case, the advantages of redundancy are negated.  Strategies for the avoidance of common mode failures include keeping redundant components physically isolated.

A prime example of redundancy with isolation is a [[nuclear power|nuclear power plant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document | title=A Study of Common-Mode Failures | publisher=UK Atomic Energy Authority: Safety and Reliability Directorate | author1=Edwards, G. T. |author2=Watson, I. A. | work=SRD R146 | date=July 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document | title=Defences against Common-Mode Failures in Redundancy Systems – A Guide for Management, Designers and Operators | publisher=UK Atomic Energy Authority: Safety and Reliability Directorate | author1=Bourne, A.

The new [[European Pressurized Reactor]] has two [[containment building]]s, one inside the other.  However, even here it is possible for a common mode failure to occur (for example, in the [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]], mains power was severed by the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake]], then the thirteen backup diesel generators were all simultaneously disabled by the subsequent tsunami that flooded the basements of the turbine halls).

In [[computational complexity theory]] and [[analysis of algorithms]], a number of metrics are defined describing the resources, such as time or space, that a machine needs to solve a particular problem. Interpreting these metrics meaningfully requires context, and this context is frequently implicit and depends on the field and the problem under consideration. This article describes a number of important pieces of context and how they affect metrics.

== Definitions of variables ==

Metrics are usually described in terms of variables that are a function of the input. For example, the statement that [[insertion sort]] requires [[Big-O notation|O]](''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) comparisons is meaningless without defining ''n'', which in this case is the number of elements in the input list.

Because many different contexts use the same letters for their variables, confusion can arise. For example, the complexity of [[primality test]]s and [[multiplication algorithm]]s can be measured in two different ways: one in terms of the integers being tested or multiplied, and one in terms of the number of [[binary numeral system|binary]] digits (bits) in those integers. For example, if ''n'' is the integer being tested for primality, [[trial division]] can test it in Θ(n&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;) arithmetic operations; but if ''n'' is the number of bits in the integer being tested for primality, it requires Θ(2&lt;sup&gt;n/2&lt;/sup&gt;) time. In the fields of [[cryptography]] and [[computational number theory]], it is more typical to define the variable as the number of bits in the input integers.

In the field of [[computational complexity theory]], the input is usually specified as a binary string (or a string in some fixed alphabet), and the variable is usually the number of bits in this string. This measure depends on the specific encoding of the input, which must be specified. For example, if the input is an integer specified using [[unary coding]], trial division will require only Θ(n&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;) arithmetic operations; but if the same input is specified in binary (or any larger base) the complexity rises to Θ(2&lt;sup&gt;n/2&lt;/sup&gt;) operations, not because the algorithm is taking any additional time, but because the number of bits in the input ''n'' has become exponentially smaller. In the other direction, ''succinct circuits'' are compact representations of a limited class of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s that occupy exponentially less space than ordinary representations like adjacency lists. Many graph algorithms on succinct circuits are [[EXPTIME-complete]], whereas the same problems expressed with conventional representations are only [[P-complete]], because the succinct circuit inputs have smaller encodings.

[[Output-sensitive algorithm]]s define their complexity not only in terms of their input but also their output. For example, [[Chan's algorithm]] can compute the [[convex hull]] of a set of points in O(''n'' log ''h'') time, where ''n'' is the number of points in the input and ''h'' is the number of points in the resulting convex hull, a subset of the input points. Because every input point ''might'' be in the convex hull, an analysis in terms of the input alone would yield the less precise O(''n'' log ''n'') time.

The complexity of some algorithms depends not only on parameters of the input but also parameters of the machine the algorithm is being run on; as mentioned in [[#Metric being measured]] below, this is typical in analyzing algorithms that run on systems with fixed cache hierarchies, where the complexity may depend on parameters such as cache size and block size.

== Abstract machine ==

To analyze an algorithm precisely, one must assume it is being executed by a particular [[abstract machine]]. For example, on a [[random access machine]], [[binary search algorithm|binary search]] can be used to rapidly locate a particular value in a sorted list in only O(log ''n'') comparisons, where ''n'' is the number of elements in the list; on a [[Turing machine]], this is not possible, since it can only move one memory cell at a time and so requires Ω(''n'') steps to even reach an arbitrary value in the list.

Moreover, different abstract machines define different ''primitive'' operations, which are operations that can be performed in constant time. Some machines, like Turing machines, only permit one bit at a time to be read or written; these are called bit operations, and the number of bit operations required to solve a problem is called its '''bit complexity'''. Bit complexity generalizes to any machine where the memory cells are of a fixed size that does not depend on the input; for this reason, algorithms that manipulate numbers much larger than the registers on ordinary PCs are typically analyzed in terms of their bit complexity. Put another way, the bit complexity is the complexity when the word size is a single bit, where word size is the size of each memory cell and register.

Another commonly used model has words with log ''n'' bits, where ''n'' is a variable depending on the input. For example, in [[graph algorithm]]s, it is typical to assume that the vertices are numbered 1 through ''n'' and that each memory cell can hold any of these values, so that they can refer to any vertex. This is justified in problems where the input uses Ω(''n'') words of storage, since on real computers, the memory cell and register size is typically selected in order to be able to index any word in memory. Operations on these words, such as copies and arithmetic operations, are assumed to operate in constant time, rather than O(log ''n'') time. The number of word operations required to solve a problem in this model is sometimes called its '''word complexity'''.

In [[computational complexity theory]], researchers intentionally define [[complexity class]]es in a way intended to make them machine-independent - that is, if a problem lies in a particular class relative to a particular "reasonable" machine, it will lie in that class relative to any "reasonable" machine. For example, as mentioned above, the time complexity of [[binary search algorithm|binary search]] depends on whether a Turing machine or a random access machine is used; but regardless of the machine choice, it lies in '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', the class of polynomial-time algorithms. In general, '''P''' is considered a machine-independent class because any operation that can be simulated in polynomial time can be assumed to require constant time, since it can be treated as a subroutine without exceeding the polynomial-time bound.

[[Oracle machine]]s are machines that have a specific operation that they can perform in constant time; this operation can be arbitrarily complex and can dramatically affect the complexity of algorithms performed on the machine. For example, if one has an oracle to solve any [[NP-complete]] problem, then any problem in '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' can be solved in polynomial time (whereas without the oracle, no polynomial-time algorithm is known for many of these problems). Oracle machines are impractical to construct but useful in theory for determining which proof techniques will be effective.

== Metric being measured ==

It's typical to say without qualification that [[insertion sort]] requires O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) time; however, it doesn't make sense to say that the bit complexity of insertion sort is O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), unless the elements being sorted are of constant size. If the elements are assumed to be integers between 1 and ''n'', then the word complexity where words have log ''n'' bits would be O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), but it's preferable to have a model that allows sorting of lists other than lists of small integers, such as lists of strings. In this case, instead of measuring the number of time steps the abstract machine takes, it's preferable to define a particular metric appropriate to the problem at hand. For [[comparison sort]] algorithms, which examine the input using only comparisons and modify it using only exchanges (swaps), the typical metric is either the number of element comparisons performed, the number of element exchanges performed, or the sum of these. Different comparison sort algorithms can be compared using these metrics, but for useful comparison with non-comparison sorting algorithms, such as [[radix sort]], a different metric must be used, and the set of elements must be restricted.

Because disk operations are orders of magnitude slower than accesses to main memory, the typical metric used in disk-based algorithms is the number of disk seeks or the number of blocks read from the disk, which depend on both the input and the parameters of the disk. RAM accesses and CPU operations are "free." Similarly, in many models used to study data structures, such as the [[Cache-oblivious algorithm|cache-oblivious model]], operations on cached data are considered "free" because they are typically orders of magnitude faster in practice than access to main memory. Consequently, the typical metric used is the number of cache misses, which depends on both the input and parameters of the cache.

[[File:Steinerne Rinne HQ.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Steinerne Rinne (Kaiser)|Steinerne Rinne]]'' couloir from the north with the peaks of [[Predigtstuhl (Kaiser)|Predigtstuhl]] (l) and [[Fleischbank]] (r) in the [[Austria]]n [[Kaiser Mountains]]]]

A '''''couloir''''' ({{IPA-fr|ku.lwaʁ|lang}}, "passage" or "corridor"), is a narrow [[gully]] with a steep gradient in a mountainous terrain.&lt;ref&gt;Whittow, John (1984). ''Dictionary of Physical Geography''. London: Penguin, p. 121. {{ISBN|0-14-051094-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
A couloir may be a seam, scar, or fissure, or vertical [[crevasse]] in an otherwise solid mountain mass. Though often hemmed in by sheer cliff walls, couloirs may also be less well-defined, and often simply a line of broken talus or [[scree]] ascending the mountainside and bordered by trees or other natural features. Couloirs are especially significant in winter months when they may be filled in with snow or ice, and become much more noticeable than in warmer months when most of the snow and ice may recede. These physical features make the use of couloirs popular for both [[mountaineering]] and [[skiing]].

==Winter Sports==
While in the [[United States]] such terrain features are uncommon at [[ski resort]]s, in [[Europe]] they are more common. Couloirs are frequently considered an [[off-piste]] trail and, as such, are not marked on ski [[piste]] maps. Some exceptions to this include: 
*The ''Grand Couloir'' in [[Courchevel]], [[France]], which has historically variable classifications but is now graded as a [[Piste#Ratings|black]] run under French piste difficulty grading
* The ''Massif du [[Mont Blanc]]'', which has many well-known, celebrated, and frequently visited couloirs
*''Gervasutti Couloir''
*''Breche Nonne Couloir''
*''Chevalier Couloir''
* ''Cosmiques couloirs'' 
* [[Jackson Hole Mountain Resort]]'s [[Corbet's Couloir]]
* [[Sugar Bowl Ski Resort]] in California's run called "Nancy's Couloir"
* [[Big Sky Resort]] in Montana's
**"Big Couloir" run, which at a 50 degree pitch for over 1,000 feet of vertical is one of the most intense in-bounds trails in America
**Little Couloir, a lesser-known run located just to the side of Big Couloir, which has an even steeper pitch between 55 and 60 degrees, with the entry about 59 degrees.  
*The [[double black diamond]]  run on Blackcomb Mountain in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada, called "Couloir Extreme", which is located inside the [[Whistler-Blackcomb]] resort boundaries and can be accessed via chairlift
* The [[Norton Couloir]], on the north face of [[Mount Everest]], was descended by snowboard for the first time by French snowboarder [[Marco Siffredi]] in 2001.

'''Crowding''' is a [[perception|perceptual]] phenomenon where the [[Cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition|recognition of objects]] (or graphemes) presented away from the [[Fovea centralis|fovea]] is impaired by the presence of other neighbouring objects (sometimes called "flankers").&lt;ref name=Levi&gt;{{cite journal |author=Levi D |title=Crowding - an essential bottleneck for object recognition: a mini-review |journal=Vision Research |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=635–654 |date=February 2008 |doi=10.1016/j.visres.2007.12.009 |pmid=18226828 |pmc=2268888}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that crowding occurs due to mandatory integration of the crowded objects by a [[Pattern recognition|texture-processing neural mechanism]].&lt;ref name=ParkesEtAl&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Parkes L |author2=Lund J |author3=Angelucci A |author4=Solomon JA |author5=Morgan M |title=Compulsory averaging of crowded orientation signals in human vision |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=4 |issue=7 |pages=739–744 |year=2001 |doi=10.1038/89532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowding deficits have been specifically found in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism and may have profound clinical implications in these disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kraehenmann|first=Rainer|author2=Vollenweider FX |author3=Seifritz E |author4=Kometer M |title=Crowding deficits in the visual periphery of schizophrenia patients|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=9|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0045884|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0045884 |pmid=23049884 |pages=e45884 |pmc=3458825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[printmaking]], an '''edition''' is a number of prints struck from one plate, usually at the same time. This may be a ''limited edition'', with a fixed number of impressions produced on the understanding that no further impressions (copies) will be produced later, or an ''open edition'' limited only by the number that can be sold or produced before the plate wears. Most modern artists produce only limited editions, normally signed by the artist in pencil, and numbered as say 67/100 to show the unique number of that impression and the total edition size.

== Original or reproduction? ==
An important and often confused distinction is that between editions of original prints, produced in the same medium as the artist worked (e.g., etching, or lithography), and reproduction prints (or paintings), which are photographic reproductions of the original work, essentially in the same category as a picture in a book or magazine, though better printed and on better paper.  These may be marketed as "limited editions" with investment potential (which is rarely realized), and even signed and numbered by the artist. Some knowledge is often required to tell the difference.

== Development of the concept ==
[[File:Rembrandt House Museum, printing studioDSCF7277.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Rembrandt House Museum]], printing studio]]

One of the main reasons for the development of printmaking was the desire of artists to make more money from their work by selling multiple copies; printmaking satisfies this motive. The production of multiple copies also tends to reduce production costs and market price when compared to a single or unique image. Until the 19th century, in the period of the [[Old master print]] the concept of an edition did not really apply to prints, unlike books.  Prints were often run off as demand allowed, and often worn-out plates were reworked by the original artist or another, to produce a new [[State (printmaking)|state]]. The art market attempts to distinguish between "lifetime impressions" and "late impressions", which were produced after the death of the artist. This can be done to some extent by the study of the [[paper]] involved, and its [[watermark]], and the condition of the plate as revealed by the printed image.  But it remains a difficult area.   
[[File:Goya - Befreit uns niemand von unseren Fesseln ca 1799.jpeg|thumb|left|180px|[[Aquatint]] by [[Francisco de Goya|Goya]], from the Cycle "[[Los Caprichos]]": Can't Anyone Untie Us?]]
The [[aquatint]]s of [[Goya]], which are done in a technique that wears out quickly on the plate, were the first important prints to be published initially in limited editions, which however were not signed or numbered. In fact the plates survived, and since Goya's death several further editions have been published, showing a progressive and drastic decline in quality of the image, despite some rework. Because of this and other cases, "posthumous editions" produced after the death of an artist, and obviously not signed by him, are usually far less sought after. The plates of later prints are often "cancelled" by defacing the image, with a couple of impressions of the cancelled plate taken to document it. This is now expected by collectors and investors, who want the prints they buy to retain their value.

== Modern practice ==
Prints by artists today may potentially retain their financial value as art (i.e., as an appreciating investment) because they are created by an artistic process rather than by a strictly mechanical one, and may become scarce because the number of multiples is limited. In [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]]'s time, the limit on the size of an edition was practical: a plate degrades through use, putting an upper limit on the number of images to be struck. Plates can be reworked and restored to some degree, but it is generally not possible to create more than a thousand prints from any process except lithography or woodcut. A few hundred is a more practical upper limit, and even that allows for significant variation in the quality of the image. In drypoint, 10 or 20 may be the maximum number of top-quality impressions possible.

Today, artists will sometimes refer to a print as a "one-off," meaning that the artist has made a unique print and no reproductions of it from the original matrix, often not even a proof. In this category one sometimes finds monotypes, monoprints, collagraphs, altered prints with collage or chine colle additions, or even hand-colored prints. There remain artists who are strong advocates of "artist's prints" which are conceived, printed, signed, and given the edition number 1/1 by the artist. One contemporary printmaker says that she believes that "there is a natural sequence of actions and thoughts which cannot be approximated by the substitution of an artist/printer collaboration unless the artist is truly involved with the printer or assistant in every step of the decision-making and mark-making processes." &lt;ref&gt;Mitzi Humphrey, ''In Search of the Meandering Absolute: The Prints of Mitzi Humphrey''. Thesis (M.F.A.)Department of Painting and Printmaking,Virginia Commonwealth University, 1997. p.1, Abstract, 64 pp. https://www.worldcat.org/title/in-search-of-the-meandering-absolute-the-prints-of-mitzi-humphrey/oclc/41232924&amp;referer=brief_results&lt;/ref&gt;

== Numbering ==
Because of the variation in quality, lower-numbered prints in an edition are sometimes favored as superior, especially with older works where the image was struck until the plate wore out. However the numbering of impressions in fact may well not equate at all to the sequence in which they were printed, and may often be the reverse of it.

In later times, printmakers recognized the value of limiting the size of an edition and including the volume of the edition in the print number (e.g., "15/30" for the 15th print in an edition of 30). Tight controls on the process to limit or eliminate variation in quality have become the norm. In [[monotyping]], a technique where only two impressions at most can be taken, prints may be numbered 1/1, or marked "unique". Artists usually print an edition much smaller than the plate allows, both for marketing reasons and to keep the edition comfortably within the lifespan of the plate. Specific steps may also be taken to strengthen the plate, such as electroplating [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] images, which uses an electric process to put a very thin coat of a stronger metal onto a plate of a weaker metal. 

The conventions for numbering prints are well-established, but other marks may indicate that a print has been made in addition to the numbered prints of an edition. [[Artist's proof]]s are marked "A. P." or "P/A", sometimes E. A. or E. d'A. (épreuve d'artiste); monoprints and uniquely hand-altered prints are marked "unique"; prints that are given to someone or are for some reason unsuitable for sale are marked "H. C." or "H/C", meaning "hors de commerce", not for sale. These are usually prints reserved for the publisher, like Artist's Proofs.  The printer is also often allowed to retain some proof impressions; these are marked "P. P." Finally, a master image may be printed against which the members of the edition are compared for quality: these are marked as "bon à tirer" or "BAT" ("good to print" in French). In all, the number of the main edition can represent 50% or less of the total number of good impressions taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Terms: Printmaking|url=http://www.artcellarexchange.com/glossary_printmaking.html|publisher=Art Cellar Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional artist printmakers will sometimes limit an edition to several [[artist's proof]] copies, including a "bon a tirer" print and then one unique copy designated as a "[[one-off]]" or "1/1" or "one/off".

==Consumer protection laws==
California became the first state to regulate the sale of limited edition art prints with the "California Print Law" of 1971. The state of Illinois later expanded on the California statute. However, it was not until 1986 that more comprehensive provisions, still in place today, were enacted with the passage of the "Georgia Print Law". That law became the template for statutes subsequently enacted by other states.

The '''Georgia Print Law''' written by (former) State Representative [[Chesley V. Morton]], became effective July 1, 1986. The law requires art dealers, artists, or auctioneers to supply information to prospective purchasers about the nature of the print, the number of prints and editions (including HC editions) produced, and the involvement (if any) of the artist in the creation of the print. The penalty for violation of the law ranges from simple reimbursement to treble damages, in the case of a willful violation. Those found to be in violation of the law are also liable for court costs, expenses, and attorney fees. The law applies to works of art valued at more than $100.00 (not including frame). Charitable organizations are specifically exempt from the provision of the law.  The statute of limitations is one year after discovery, and, if discovery of the violation is not made within three years of the sale, then the purchaser’s remedies are extinguished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artsgeorgia.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Ga-Limited-Edition-Reproduction-Act.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617081914/http://artsgeorgia.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Ga-Limited-Edition-Reproduction-Act.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the common law form of action|a fuller discussion of modern proceedings|Eviction}}

'''Ejectment''' is a [[common law]] term for civil action to recover the possession of or title to land.  It replaced the old real actions and the various possessory assizes (denoting county-based pleas to local sittings of the courts) where boundary disputes often featured.  Though still used in some places, the term is now obsolete in many common law jurisdictions, in which possession and title are sued by the actions of [[eviction]] (also called possession proceedings) and [[quiet title]] (or injunctive and/or declaratory relief), respectively.   

Originally, successful ejectment meant recovery of possession of land, for example against a defaulting tenant or a [[trespasser]], who did not have (or no longer had) any right to remain there.  It has continued to be used for this, though in some jurisdictions the terminology has changed.

The old real actions, which were concerned with the title to land, were found to be too technical and difficult to use. A practice developed of trying the title to ownership of land by means of a special ejectment chiefly for ensuring a low court and had the added advantage of some confidentiality among the landed gentry. The claimant granted (or so professed) a lease to a friend which had passed to a [[legal fiction|fictitious]] person (such as [[John Doe]]), who became the nominal plaintiff: the real claimant (plaintiff) was thereby the "lessor of the plaintiff".  The action was vicarious.  The action was brought against the real defendant or, more usually, for semi-secrecy and to ensure the low court, against another fictitious person (e.g. [[John Doe|William Styles]]), in many papers termed the "casual ejector",&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
  |url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Casual+ejector
  |title=Casual ejector
  |work=Legal Dictionary
  |publisher=TheFreeDictionary.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; who both sides' papers would state evicted the first fictitious tenant(s) by virtue of an (equally fictitious) lease granted by the real defendant. The title of the action would then be "Doe dem. [name of real claimant] v. [Defendant] or [fictitous counter-tenant]".  E.g. ''Doe dem. John Hurrell Luscombe {{abbreviation|v|versus}} Yates, Hawker, and Mudge (1822) 5 B. &amp; Ald. 544'' (England; 1822),&lt;ref name="england"&gt;[https://deedpolloffice.com/change-name/law/case-law/Doe-dem-Luscombe-v-Yates-1822 ''Doe dem. John Hurrell Luscombe v Yates, Hawker, and Mudge (1822) 5 B. &amp; Ald. 544'']&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter was sent in the name of the casual ejector to the real defendant, inviting him to defend the case on behalf of his supposed tenant. The defendant's right to appear depended on the existence of the fictitious lease (an existence he would willingly assert). This enabled the rights of the real parties to be litigated in a low court. Such fictitious actions have been abolished in many jurisdictions as a result of the provision of alternative remedies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12698">'''Electronic entropy''' is the [[entropy]] of a system attributable to electrons' probabilistic occupation of states. This entropy can take a number of forms. The first form can be termed a [[density of states]] based entropy. The [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|Fermi–Dirac distribution]] implies that each eigenstate of a system, {{math|''i''}}, is occupied with a certain probability, {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. As the entropy is given by a sum over the probabilities of occupation of those states, there is an entropy associated with the occupation of the various electronic states. In most molecular systems, the energy spacing between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital is usually large, and thus the probabilities associated with the occupation of the excited states are small. Therefore, the electronic entropy in molecular systems can safely be neglected. Electronic entropy is thus most relevant for the thermodynamics of condensed phases, where the density of states at the [[Fermi level]] can be quite large, and the electronic entropy can thus contribute substantially to thermodynamic behavior.&lt;ref name='Wolverton 1995'&gt;{{cite journal

==From the density of states==

===General Formulation===

The entropy due to a set of states that can be either occupied with probability &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; or empty with probability &lt;math&gt;1-p_i&lt;/math&gt; can be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;S=-k_{\rm B}\sum_i n_i [ p_i \ln p_i + (1-p_i) \ln( 1 - p_i ) ] &lt;/math&gt;,

where {{math| ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}} is [[Boltzmann constant]].

For a continuously distributed set of states as a function of energy, such as the eigenstates in an [[electronic band structure]], the above sum can be written as an integral over the possible energy values, rather than a sum. Switching from summing over individual states to integrating over energy levels, the entropy can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;S=-k_{\rm B} \int n(E) \left [ p(E) \ln p(E) +(1- p(E)) \ln \left ( 1- p(E)\right )  \right ]dE &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''n''(''E'')}} is the [[density of states]] of the solid. The probability of occupation of each eigenstate is given by the Fermi function, {{math|''f''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;p(E)=f=\frac{1}{e^{(E-E_{\rm F}) / k_{\rm B} T} + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Fermi energy]] and {{math|''T''}} is the absolute temperature. One can then re-write the entropy as:
:&lt;math&gt;S=-k_{\rm B} \int n(E) \left [ f \ln f +(1- f) \ln \left ( 1- f \right )  \right ]dE &lt;/math&gt;
This is the general formulation of the density-of-states based electronic entropy.

===Useful approximation===

It is useful to recognize that the only states within ~{{math|{{plusmn}} ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''}} of the Fermi level contribute significantly to the entropy. Other states are either fully occupied, {{math|&lt;var&gt;f&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 1}}, or completely unoccupied, {{math|&lt;var&gt;f&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 0}}. In either case, these states do not contribute to the entropy. If one assumes that the density of states is constant within {{math|{{plusmn}} ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''}} of the Fermi level, one can derive that the electronic entropy is equal to:&lt;ref name=Nicholson1995 /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S=\frac{\pi}{3} k_{\rm B}^2 T n(E_{\rm F})&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''n''(''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is the density of states at the Fermi level. Several other approximations can be made, but they all indicate that the electronic entropy should, to first order, be proportional to the temperature and the density of states at the Fermi level. As the density of states at the Fermi level varies widely between systems, this approximation is a reasonable heuristic for inferring when it may be necessary to include electronic entropy in the thermodynamic description of a system; only systems with large densities of states at the Fermi level should exhibit non-negligible electronic entropy (where large may be approximately defined as {{math|''n''(''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;) ≥ (''k''{{su|b=B|p=2}}''T'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}).

== Application to different materials classes ==
'''Insulators''' have zero density of states at the Fermi level due to their [[band gap]]s. Thus, the density of states-based electronic entropy is essentially zero in these systems.

'''Metals''' have non-zero density of states at the Fermi level. Metals with free-electron-like band structures (e.g. alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, Cu, and Al) generally exhibit relatively low density of states at the Fermi level, and therefore exhibit fairly low electronic entropies. Transition metals, wherein the flat d-bands lie close to the Fermi level, generally exhibit much larger electronic entropies than the free-electron like metals.

'''Oxides''' have particularly flat band structures and thus can exhibit large {{math|''n''(''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, if the Fermi level intersects these bands. As most oxides are insulators, this is generally not the case. However, when oxides are metallic (i.e. the Fermi level lies within an unfilled, flat set of bands), oxides exhibit some of the largest electronic entropies of any material.

'''Thermoelectric materials''' are specifically engineered to have large electronic entropies. The [[thermoelectric effect]] relies on charge carriers exhibiting large entropies, as the driving force to establish a gradient in electrical potential is driven by the entropy associated with the charge carriers. In the thermoelectric literature, the term ''band structure engineering'' refers to the manipulation of material structure and chemistry to achieve a high density of states near the Fermi level. More specifically, thermoelectric materials are intentionally doped to exhibit only partially filled bands at the Fermi level, resulting in high electronic entropies.&lt;ref name=Pei2012&gt;{{cite journal

==Configurational electronic entropy==
Configurational electronic entropy is usually observed in mixed-valence transition metal oxides, as the charges in these systems are both localized (the system is ionic), and capable of changing (due to the mixed valency). To a first approximation (i.e. assuming that the charges are distributed randomly), the molar configurational electronic entropy is given by:&lt;ref name=Zhou2006 /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S \approx n_\text{sites} \left [ x \ln  x + (1-x) \ln (1-x) \right ] &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;sites&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the fraction of sites on which a localized electron/hole could reside (typically a transition metal site), and {{math|''x''}} is the concentration of localized electrons/holes. Of course, the localized charges are not distributed randomly, as the charges will interact electrostatically with one another, and so the above formula should only be regarded as an approximation to the configurational atomic entropy. More sophisticated approximations have been made in the literature.&lt;ref name=Zhou2006 /&gt;

'''Epidemiology''' is the study and analysis of the distribution (who, when, and where) and [[risk factor|determinants]] of health and disease conditions in defined [[population]]s.

It is the cornerstone of [[public health]], and shapes policy decisions and [[evidence-based practice]] by identifying [[risk factor]]s for disease and targets for [[preventive healthcare]]. Epidemiologists help with study design, collection, and [[statistical analysis]] of data, amend interpretation and dissemination of results (including [[peer review]] and occasional [[systematic review]]). Epidemiology has helped develop [[methodology]] used in [[clinical research]], [[public health]] studies, and, to a lesser extent, [[basic research]] in the biological sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Miquel Porta |title=A Dictionary of Epidemiology |url=http://global.oup.com/academic/product/a-dictionary-of-epidemiology-9780199976737?cc=us&amp;lang=en |edition=6th |year=2014 |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-997673-7 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major areas of epidemiological study include disease causation, [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]], [[outbreak]] investigation, [[disease surveillance]], [[forensic epidemiology]], [[occupational epidemiology]], [[screening (medicine)|screening]], [[biomonitoring]], and comparisons of treatment effects such as in [[clinical trials]]. Epidemiologists rely on other scientific disciplines like [[biology]] to better understand disease processes, [[statistics]] to make efficient use of the data and draw appropriate conclusions, [[social science]]s to better understand proximate and distal causes, and [[engineering]] for [[exposure assessment]].

== Etymology ==
''Epidemiology'', literally meaning "the study of what is upon the people", is derived {{ety|gre|epi|upon, among||[[Glossary of rhetorical terms#Demos|demos]]|people, district||[[logos]]|study, word, discourse}}, suggesting that it applies only to human populations. However, the term is widely used in studies of zoological populations (veterinary epidemiology), although the term "[[epizoology]]" is available, and it has also been applied to studies of plant populations (botanical or [[plant disease epidemiology]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Nutter, Jr. |first= F.W. |title= Understanding the interrelationships between botanical, human, and veterinary epidemiology: the Ys and Rs of it all |journal= Ecosys Health |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=131–40 |year=1999 |doi=10.1046/j.1526-0992.1999.09922.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between "epidemic" and "endemic" was first drawn by [[Hippocrates]],&lt;ref&gt;Hippocrates. (~200BC). Airs, Waters, Places.&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish between diseases that are "visited upon" a population (epidemic) from those that "reside within" a population (endemic).&lt;ref name="Carol Buck 1998 p3"&gt;Carol Buck, Alvaro Llopis, Enrique Nájera, Milton Terris. (1998). The Challenge of Epidemiology: Issues and Selected Readings. Scientific Publication No. 505. Pan American Health Organization. Washington, DC. p3.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "epidemiology" appears to have first been used to describe the study of epidemics in 1802 by the Spanish physician Villalba in ''Epidemiología Española''.&lt;ref name="Carol Buck 1998 p3"/&gt; Epidemiologists also study the interaction of diseases in a population, a condition known as a [[syndemic]].

The term epidemiology is now widely applied to cover the description and causation of not only epidemic disease, but of disease in general, and even many non-disease, health-related conditions, such as high blood pressure and [[obesity]]. Therefore, this epidemiology is based upon how the pattern of the disease causes change in the function of everyone.

=== Modern era ===
{{See also|History of emerging infectious diseases}}
In the middle of the 16th century, a doctor from [[Verona]] named [[Girolamo Fracastoro]] was the first to propose a theory that these very small, unseeable, particles that cause disease were alive. They were considered to be able to spread by air, multiply by themselves and to be destroyable by fire. In this way he refuted [[Galen]]'s [[Miasma theory of disease|miasma theory]] (poison gas in sick people). In 1543 he wrote a book ''[[De contagione et contagiosis morbis]]'', in which he was the first to promote personal and environmental [[hygiene]] to prevent disease. The development of a sufficiently powerful microscope by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] in 1675 provided visual evidence of living particles consistent with a [[germ theory of disease]].

[[Wu Youke]] (1582–1652) developed the concept that some diseases were caused by transmissible agents, which he called liqi (pestilential factors). His book Wenyi Lun (Treatise on Acute Epidemic Febrile Diseases) can be regarded as the main etiological work that brought forward the concept, ultimately attributed to Westerners, of germs as a cause of epidemic diseases (source: http://baike.baidu.com/view/143117.htm). His concepts are still considered in current scientific research in relation to Traditional Chinese Medicine studies (see: http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js6170e/4.html).

Another pioneer, [[Thomas Sydenham]] (1624–1689), was the first to distinguish the fevers of Londoners in the later 1600s. His theories on cures of fevers met with much resistance from traditional physicians at the time. He was not able to find the initial cause of the [[smallpox]] fever he researched and treated.&lt;ref name="Merril, Ray M. 2010"/&gt;

[[File:Snow-cholera-map.jpg|thumb|350px|Original map by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] showing the [[cluster (epidemiology)|cluster]]s of cholera cases in the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|London epidemic of 1854]].]]
[[John Graunt]], a [[haberdasher]] and amateur statistician, published ''Natural and Political Observations ... upon the Bills of Mortality'' in 1662. In it, he analysed the mortality rolls in [[London]] before the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]], presented one of the first [[life tables]], and reported time trends for many diseases, new and old. He provided statistical evidence for many theories on disease, and also refuted some widespread ideas on them.

[[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] is famous for his investigations into the causes of the 19th century cholera epidemics, and is also known as the father of (modern) epidemiology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/fatherofepidemiology.html Doctor John Snow Blames Water Pollution for Cholera Epidemic, by David Vachon] UCLA Department of Epidemlology, School of Public Health May &amp; June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3935461 John Snow, Father of Epidemiology] NPR Talk of the Nation. 24 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He began with noticing the significantly higher death rates in two areas supplied by Southwark Company. His identification of the [[Broadwick Street|Broad Street]] pump as the cause of the Soho epidemic is considered the classic example of epidemiology. Snow used chlorine in an attempt to clean the water and removed the handle; this ended the outbreak. This has been perceived as a major event in the history of [[public health]] and regarded as the founding event of the science of epidemiology, having helped shape public health policies around the world.&lt;ref&gt;

His findings were published in 1850, but his work was ill-received by his colleagues, who discontinued the procedure. Disinfection did not become widely practiced until British surgeon [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] 'discovered' [[antiseptics]] in 1865 in light of the work of [[Louis Pasteur]].

In the early 20th century, mathematical methods were introduced into epidemiology by [[Ronald Ross]], [[Janet Lane-Claypon]], [[Anderson Gray McKendrick]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6DD1FKq6fFoC&amp;lpg=PA323&amp;pg=PA323#v=onepage&amp;q=mathematical%20methods%20were%20introduced%20into%20epidemiology%2020th%20century%20ross Statisticians of the centuries].

Another breakthrough was the 1954 publication of the results of a [[British Doctors Study]], led by [[Richard Doll]] and [[Austin Bradford Hill]], which lent very strong statistical support to the link between [[tobacco smoking]] and [[lung cancer]].

In the late 20th century, with advancement of biomedical sciences, a number of molecular markers in blood, other biospecimens and environment were identified as predictors of development or risk of a certain disease. Epidemiology research to examine the relationship between these [[biomarker]]s analyzed at the molecular level, and disease was broadly named “[[molecular epidemiology]]”. Specifically, "[[genetic epidemiology]]" has been used for epidemiology of germline genetic variation and disease. Genetic variation is typically determined using DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes. Since the 2000s, [[Genome-wide association study|genome-wide association studies]] (GWAS) have been commonly performed to identify genetic risk factors for many diseases and health conditions.

While most molecular epidemiology studies are still using conventional disease [[diagnosis]] and classification systems, it is increasingly recognized that disease progression represents inherently heterogeneous processes differing from person to person. Conceptually, each individual has a unique disease process different from any other individual (“the unique disease principle”),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogino S, Fuchs CS, Giovannucci E | year = 2012 | title = How many molecular subtypes?

Studies to examine the relationship between an exposure and molecular pathologic signature of disease (particularly [[cancer]]) became increasingly common throughout the 2000s. However, the use of [[molecular pathology]] in epidemiology posed unique challenges including lack of research guidelines and standardized [[Statistics|statistical]] methodologies, and paucity of interdisciplinary experts and training programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogino S, King EE, Beck AH, Sherman ME, Milner DA, Giovannucci E | year = 2012 | title = Interdisciplinary education to integrate pathology and epidemiology: Towards molecular and population-level health science | url = | journal = Am J Epidemiol | volume = 176 | issue = | pages = 659–67 | doi=10.1093/aje/kws226| pmc = 3571252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the concept of disease heterogeneity appears to conflict with the long-standing premise in epidemiology that individuals with the same disease name have similar etiologies and disease processes. To resolve these issues and advance population health science in the era of molecular [[precision medicine]], “[[molecular pathology]]” and “epidemiology” was integrated to create a new interdisciplinary field of “[[molecular pathological epidemiology]]” (MPE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogino S, Stampfer M | year = 2010 | title = Lifestyle factors and microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer: the evolving field of molecular pathological epidemiology | url = | journal = J Natl Cancer Inst | volume = 102 | issue = | pages = 365–7 | doi=10.1093/jnci/djq031 | pmid=20208016 | pmc=2841039}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogino S, Chan AT, Fuchs CS, Giovannucci E | year = 2011 | title = Molecular pathological epidemiology of colorectal neoplasia: an emerging transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary field | url = | journal = Gut | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 397–411 | doi=10.1136/gut.2010.217182 | pmid=21036793 | pmc=3040598}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined as “epidemiology of [[molecular pathology]] and heterogeneity of disease”. In MPE, investigators analyze the relationships between; (A) environmental, dietary, lifestyle and genetic factors; (B) alterations in cellular or extracellular molecules; and (C) evolution and progression of disease.

== Types of studies ==
{{Main|Study design}}
Epidemiologists employ a range of study designs from the observational to experimental and generally categorized as descriptive, analytic (aiming to further examine known associations or hypothesized relationships), and experimental (a term often equated with clinical or community trials of treatments and other interventions). In observational studies, nature is allowed to “take its course," as epidemiologists observe from the sidelines. Conversely, in experimental studies, the epidemiologist is the one in control of all of the factors entering a certain case study.&lt;ref name="Epidemiology 2009"&gt;"Principles of Epidemiology." Key Concepts in Public Health. London: Sage UK, 2009. Credo Reference. 1 August 2011. Web. 30 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Epidemiological studies are aimed, where possible, at revealing unbiased relationships between [[Exposure Assessment#Exposure|exposures]] such as alcohol or smoking, [[infections|biological agents]], [[stress (medicine)|stress]], or [[Chemical compound|chemicals]] to [[death|mortality]] or [[morbidity]]. The identification of causal relationships between these exposures and outcomes is an important aspect of epidemiology. Modern epidemiologists use [[Health informatics|informatics]] as a tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garzia|first=Nichole A.|last2=Spinelli|first2=John J.|last3=Gotay|first3=Carolyn C.|last4=Teschke|first4=Kay|date=2018-07-03|title=Literature review: dermal monitoring data for pesticide exposure assessment of farm workers|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=187–214|doi=10.1080/1059924x.2018.1448734|pmid=30047858|issn=1059-924X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observational studies have two components, descriptive and analytical. Descriptive observations pertain to the “who, what, where and when of health-related state occurrence”. However, analytical observations deal more with the ‘how’ of a health-related event.&lt;ref name="Epidemiology 2009"/&gt; [[Experimental epidemiology]] contains three case types: randomized controlled trials (often used for new medicine or drug testing), field trials (conducted on those at a high risk of contracting a disease), and community trials (research on social originating diseases).&lt;ref name="Epidemiology 2009"/&gt;

The term 'epidemiologic triad' is used to describe the intersection of ''Host'', ''Agent'', and ''Environment'' in analyzing an outbreak.

=== Case series ===
Case-series may refer to the qualitative study of the experience of a single patient, or small group of patients with a similar diagnosis, or to a statistical factor with the potential to produce illness with periods when they are unexposed.

The former type of study is purely descriptive and cannot be used to make inferences about the general population of patients with that disease. These types of studies, in which an astute clinician identifies an unusual feature of a disease or a patient's history, may lead to a formulation of a new hypothesis. Using the data from the series, analytic studies could be done to investigate possible causal factors. These can include case-control studies or prospective studies. A case-control study would involve matching comparable controls without the disease to the cases in the series. A prospective study would involve following the case series over time to evaluate the disease's natural history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hennekens |first1=Charles H. |author2=Julie E. Buring |year=1987 |title=Epidemiology in Medicine |editor=Mayrent, Sherry L. (Ed.) |publisher=Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins |isbn=978-0-316-35636-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter type, more formally described as self-controlled case-series studies, divide individual patient follow-up time into exposed and unexposed periods and use fixed-effects Poisson regression processes to compare the incidence rate of a given outcome between exposed and unexposed periods. This technique has been extensively used in the study of adverse reactions to vaccination and has been shown in some circumstances to provide statistical power comparable to that available in cohort studies.

=== Case-control studies ===
[[case-control study|Case-control studies]] select subjects based on their disease status. It is a retrospective study. A group of individuals that are disease positive (the "case" group) is compared with a group of disease negative individuals (the "control" group). The control group should ideally come from the same population that gave rise to the cases. The case-control study looks back through time at potential exposures that both groups (cases and controls) may have encountered. A 2×2 table is constructed, displaying exposed cases (A), exposed controls (B), unexposed cases (C) and unexposed controls (D). The statistic generated to measure association is the [[odds ratio]] (OR), which is the ratio of the odds of exposure in the cases (A/C) to the odds of exposure in the controls (B/D), i.e. OR = (AD/BC).

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! 
! Cases
! Controls
|-
| Exposed
| A
| B
|-
| Unexposed
| C
| D
|}

If the OR is significantly greater than 1, then the conclusion is "those with the disease are more likely to have been exposed," whereas if it is close to 1 then the exposure and disease are not likely associated. If the OR is far less than one, then this suggests that the exposure is a protective factor in the causation of the disease.
Case-control studies are usually faster and more cost effective than [[cohort studies]], but are sensitive to bias (such as [[recall bias]] and [[selection bias]]). The main challenge is to identify the appropriate control group; the distribution of exposure among the control group should be representative of the distribution in the population that gave rise to the cases. This can be achieved by drawing a random sample from the original population at risk. This has as a consequence that the control group can contain people with the disease under study when the disease has a high attack rate in a population.

A major drawback for case control studies is that, in order to be considered to be statistically significant, the minimum number of cases required at the 95% confidence interval is related to the odds ratio by the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{total cases} = A+C = 1.96^2 (1+N) \left(\frac{1}{\ln(OR)}\right)^2 \left(\frac{OR+2\sqrt{OR}+1}{\sqrt{OR}}\right) \approx 15.5 (1+N) \left(\frac{1}{\ln(OR)}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

where N is the ratio of cases to controls.
As the odds ratio approached 1, approaches 0; rendering case control studies all but useless for low odds ratios. For instance, for an odds ratio of 1.5 and cases = controls, the table shown above would look like this:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
! Cases
! Controls
|-
| Exposed
| 103
| 84
|-
| Unexposed
| 84
| 103
|}

For an odds ratio of 1.1:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
! Cases
! Controls
|-
| Exposed
| 1732
| 1652
|-
| Unexposed
| 1652
| 1732
|}

=== Cohort studies ===
[[Cohort studies]] select subjects based on their exposure status. The study subjects should be at risk of the outcome under investigation at the beginning of the cohort study; this usually means that they should be disease free when the cohort study starts. The cohort is followed through time to assess their later outcome status. An example of a cohort study would be the investigation of a cohort of smokers and non-smokers over time to estimate the incidence of lung cancer. The same 2×2 table is constructed as with the case control study. However, the point estimate generated is the [[relative risk]] (RR), which is the probability of disease for a person in the exposed group, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;(''A''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''B'') over the probability of disease for a person in the unexposed group, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''C''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;(''C''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''D''), i.e. ''RR''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;.

As with the OR, a RR greater than 1 shows association, where the conclusion can be read "those with the exposure were more likely to develop disease."

Prospective studies have many benefits over case control studies. The RR is a more powerful effect measure than the OR, as the OR is just an estimation of the RR, since true incidence cannot be calculated in a case control study where subjects are selected based on disease status. Temporality can be established in a prospective study, and confounders are more easily controlled for. However, they are more costly, and there is a greater chance of losing subjects to follow-up based on the long time period over which the cohort is followed.

Cohort studies also are limited by the same equation for number of cases as for cohort studies, but, if the base incidence rate in the study population is very low, the number of cases required is reduced by&amp;nbsp;½.

== Causal inference ==
{{main|Causal inference}}
Although epidemiology is sometimes viewed as a collection of statistical tools used to elucidate the associations of exposures to health outcomes, a deeper understanding of this science is that of discovering ''causal'' relationships.

"[[Correlation does not imply causation]]" is a common theme for much of the epidemiological literature. For epidemiologists, the key is in the term [[inference]]. Correlation, or at least association between two variables, is  a necessary but not sufficient criteria for inference that one variable causes the other. Epidemiologists use gathered data and a broad range of biomedical and psychosocial theories in an iterative way to generate or expand theory, to test hypotheses, and to make educated, informed assertions about which relationships are causal, and about exactly how they are causal.

Epidemiologists emphasize that the "'''one cause – one effect'''" understanding is a simplistic mis-belief.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Most outcomes, whether disease or death, are caused by a chain or web consisting of many component causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Epidemiology|last=Rothman|first=Kenneth J.|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|year=1986|isbn=0-316-75776-4|location=Boston/Toronto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Causes can be distinguished as necessary, sufficient or probabilistic conditions. If a necessary condition can be identified and controlled (e.g., antibodies to a disease agent, energy in an injury), the harmful outcome can be avoided (Robertson, 2015).

=== Bradford Hill criteria ===
{{Main|Bradford Hill criteria}}
In 1965, [[Austin Bradford Hill]] proposed a series of considerations to help assess evidence of causation,&lt;ref name="bh65"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hill |first=Austin Bradford |year=1965 |title=The Environment and Disease: Association or Causation? |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine]] |volume=58 |pages=295–300 |url=http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/hill |pmid=14283879 |pmc=1898525 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have come to be commonly known as the "[[Bradford Hill criteria]]". In contrast to the explicit intentions of their author, Hill's considerations are now sometimes taught as a checklist to be implemented for assessing causality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Phillips |first1=Carl V. |author2=Karen J. Goodman |title=The missed lessons of Sir Austin Bradford Hill |journal=Epidemiologic Perspectives and Innovations |volume=1 |issue=3 |url=http://www.epi-perspectives.com/content/1/1/3 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15507128 |pmc=524370 |doi=10.1186/1742-5573-1-3 |pages=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523185244/http://www.epi-perspectives.com/content/1/1/3 |archivedate=23 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill himself said "None of my nine viewpoints can bring indisputable evidence for or against the cause-and-effect hypothesis and none can be required ''sine qua non''."&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;

# '''Strength of Association''': A small association does not mean that there is not a causal effect, though the larger the association, the more likely that it is causal.&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Consistency of Data''': Consistent findings observed by different persons in different places with different samples strengthens the likelihood of an effect.&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Specificity''': Causation is likely if a very specific population at a specific site and disease with no other likely explanation. The more specific an association between a factor and an effect is, the bigger the probability of a causal relationship.&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Temporality''': The effect has to occur after the cause (and if there is an expected delay between the cause and expected effect, then the effect must occur after that delay).&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Biological gradient''': Greater exposure should generally lead to greater incidence of the effect. However, in some cases, the mere presence of the factor can trigger the effect. In other cases, an inverse proportion is observed: greater exposure leads to lower incidence.&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Plausibility''': A plausible mechanism between cause and effect is helpful (but Hill noted that knowledge of the mechanism is limited by current knowledge).&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Coherence''': Coherence between epidemiological and laboratory findings increases the likelihood of an effect. However, Hill noted that "... lack of such [laboratory] evidence cannot nullify the epidemiological effect on associations".&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Experiment''': "Occasionally it is possible to appeal to experimental evidence".&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Analogy''': The effect of similar factors may be considered.&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;

=== Legal interpretation ===
[[Epidemiological study|Epidemiological studies]] can only go to prove that an agent could have caused, but not that it did cause, an effect in any particular case:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Epidemiology is concerned with the [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of disease in populations and does not address the question of the cause of an individual's disease. This question, sometimes referred to as specific causation, is beyond the domain of the science of epidemiology. Epidemiology has its limits at the point where an inference is made that the relationship between an agent and a disease is causal (general causation) and where the magnitude of excess risk attributed to the agent has been determined; that is, epidemiology addresses whether an agent can cause a disease, not whether an agent did cause a specific plaintiff's disease."&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Green |first1= Michael D. |author2= D. Michal Freedman, and Leon Gordis |title= Reference Guide on Epidemiology |publisher= Federal Judicial Centre |url= http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/sciman06.pdf/$file/sciman06.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 3 February 2008 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080227143925/http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/sciman06.pdf/$file/sciman06.pdf |archivedate= 27 February 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In United States law, epidemiology alone cannot prove that a causal association does not exist in general. Conversely, it can be (and is in some circumstances) taken by US courts, in an individual case, to justify an inference that a causal association does exist, based upon a balance of [[probability]].

The subdiscipline of forensic epidemiology is directed at the investigation of specific causation of disease or injury in individuals or groups of individuals in instances in which causation is disputed or is unclear, for presentation in legal settings.

== Population-based health management ==
Epidemiological practice and the results of epidemiological analysis make a significant contribution to emerging population-based health management frameworks.

Population-based health management encompasses the ability to:

* Assess the health states and health needs of a target population;
* Implement and evaluate interventions that are designed to improve the health of that population; and
* Efficiently and effectively provide care for members of that population in a way that is consistent with the community's cultural, policy and health resource values.

Modern population-based health management is complex, requiring a multiple set of skills (medical, political, technological, mathematical etc.) of which epidemiological practice and analysis is a core component, that is unified with management science to provide efficient and effective health care and health guidance to a population. This task requires the forward looking ability of modern risk management approaches that transform health risk factors, incidence, prevalence and mortality statistics (derived from epidemiological analysis) into management metrics that not only guide how a health system responds to current population health issues, but also how a health system can be managed to better respond to future potential population health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring Health and Disease I: Introduction to Epidemiology |url=http://open.umich.edu/education/med/oernetwork/public-health/epidemiology/intro-epidemiology/2010 |accessdate=16 December 2011 |author1=Neil Myburgh |author2=Debra Jackson |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110801204104/https://open.umich.edu/education/med/oernetwork/public-health/epidemiology/intro-epidemiology/2010 |archivedate=1 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of organizations that use population-based health management that leverage the work and results of epidemiological practice include Canadian Strategy for Cancer Control, Health Canada Tobacco Control Programs, Rick Hansen Foundation, Canadian Tobacco Control Research Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Smetanin |first1=P. |author2=P.

Each of these organizations use a population-based health management framework called Life at Risk that combines epidemiological quantitative analysis with demographics, health agency operational research and economics to perform:

* ''Population Life Impacts Simulations'': Measurement of the future potential impact of disease upon the population with respect to new disease cases, prevalence, premature death as well as potential years of life lost from disability and death;
* ''Labour Force Life Impacts Simulations'': Measurement of the future potential impact of disease upon the labour force with respect to new disease cases, prevalence, premature death and potential years of life lost from disability and death;
* ''Economic Impacts of Disease Simulations'': Measurement of the future potential impact of disease upon private sector disposable income impacts (wages, corporate profits, private health care costs) and public sector disposable income impacts (personal income tax, corporate income tax, consumption taxes, [[publicly funded health care]] costs).

== Applied field epidemiology ==

Applied epidemiology is the practice of using epidemiological methods to protect or improve the health of a population. Applied field epidemiology can include investigating communicable and non-communicable disease outbreaks, mortality and morbidity rates, and nutritional status, among other indicators of health, with the purpose of communicating the results to those who can implement appropriate policies or disease control measures.

=== Humanitarian context ===

As the surveillance and reporting of diseases and other health factors becomes increasingly difficult in humanitarian crisis situations, the methodologies used to report the data are compromised. One study found that less than half (42.4%) of nutrition surveys sampled from humanitarian contexts correctly calculated the prevalence of malnutrition and only one-third (35.3%) of the surveys met the criteria for quality. Among the mortality surveys, only 3.2% met the criteria for quality. As nutritional status and mortality rates help indicate the severity of a crisis, the tracking and reporting of these health factors is crucial.

Vital registries are usually the most effective ways to collect data, but in humanitarian contexts these registries can be non-existent, unreliable, or inaccessible.  As such, mortality is often inaccurately measured using either prospective demographic surveillance or retrospective mortality surveys. Prospective demographic surveillance requires lots of manpower and is difficult to implement in a spread-out population. Retrospective morality surveys are prone to selection and reporting biases. Other methods are being developed, but are not common practice yet.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, “Health topics: Epidemiology.” http://www.who.int/topics/epidemiology/en/ Accessed: October 30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miquel Porta.

== Validity: precision and bias ==
Different fields in epidemiology have different levels of validity. One way to assess the validity of findings is the ratio of false-positives (claimed effects that are not correct) to false-negatives (studies which fail to support a true effect). To take the field of genetic epidemiology, candidate-gene studies produced over 100 false-positive findings for each false-negative. By contrast genome-wide association appear close to the reverse, with only one false positive for every 100 or more false-negatives.&lt;ref name="Ioannides2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ioannidis | first1 = J. P. A. | last2 = Tarone | first2 = R. | last3 = McLaughlin | first3 = J. K. | title = The False-positive to False-negative Ratio in Epidemiologic Studies | journal = Epidemiology | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 450–456 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21490505 | doi = 10.1097/EDE.0b013e31821b506e }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ratio has improved over time in genetic epidemiology as the field has adopted stringent criteria. By contrast other epidemiological fields have not required such rigorous reporting and are much less reliable as a result.&lt;ref name="Ioannides2011"/&gt;

=== Random error ===
Random error is the result of fluctuations around a true value because of sampling variability. Random error is just that: random. It can occur during data collection, coding, transfer, or analysis. Examples of random error include: poorly worded questions, a misunderstanding in interpreting an individual answer from a particular respondent, or a typographical error during coding. Random error affects measurement in a transient, inconsistent manner and it is impossible to correct for random error.

There is random error in all sampling procedures. This is called [[sampling error]].

Precision in epidemiological variables is a measure of random error. Precision is also inversely related to random error, so that to reduce random error is to increase precision. Confidence intervals are computed to demonstrate the precision of relative risk estimates. The narrower the confidence interval, the more precise the relative risk estimate.

There are two basic ways to reduce random error in an [[epidemiological study]]. The first is to increase the sample size of the study. In other words, add more subjects to your study. The second is to reduce the variability in measurement in the study. This might be accomplished by using a more precise measuring device or by increasing the number of measurements.

Note, that if sample size or number of measurements are increased, or a more precise measuring tool is purchased, the costs of the study are usually increased. There is usually an uneasy balance between the need for adequate precision and the practical issue of study cost.

=== Systematic error ===
A systematic error or bias occurs when there is a difference between the true value (in the population) and the observed value (in the study) from any cause other than sampling variability. An example of systematic error is if, unknown to you, the [[pulse oximeter]] you are using is set incorrectly and adds two points to the true value each time a measurement is taken. The measuring device could be [[Accuracy and precision|precise but not accurate]]. Because the error happens in every instance, it is systematic. Conclusions you draw based on that data will still be incorrect. But the error can be reproduced in the future (e.g., by using the same mis-set instrument).

A mistake in coding that affects ''all'' responses for that particular question is another example of a systematic error.

The validity of a study is dependent on the degree of systematic error. Validity is usually separated into two components:

* [[Internal validity]] is dependent on the amount of error in measurements, including exposure, disease, and the associations between these variables. Good internal validity implies a lack of error in measurement and suggests that inferences may be drawn at least as they pertain to the subjects under study.
* [[External validity]] pertains to the process of generalizing the findings of the study to the population from which the sample was drawn (or even beyond that population to a more universal statement). This requires an understanding of which conditions are relevant (or irrelevant) to the generalization. Internal validity is clearly a prerequisite for external validity.

==== Selection bias ====
[[Selection bias]] occurs when study subjects are selected or become part of the study as a result of a third, unmeasured variable which is associated with both the exposure and outcome of interest.&lt;ref name="Hernán2004"/&gt; For instance, it has repeatedly been noted that cigarette smokers and non smokers tend to differ in their study participation rates. (Sackett D cites the example of Seltzer et al., in which 85% of non smokers and 67% of smokers returned mailed questionnaires.)&lt;ref name="Sackett D. Bias in analytic research. J Chron Dis 1979; vol. 32:51–63."&gt;[http://www.epidemiology.ch/history/PDF%20bg/Sackett%20DL%201979%20bias%20in%20analytic%20research.pdf] 24&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that such a difference in response will not lead to bias if it is not also associated with a systematic difference in outcome between the two response groups.

==== Information bias ====
[[Information bias (epidemiology)|Information bias]] is bias arising from systematic error in the assessment of a variable.&lt;ref name=Rothman2002&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothman|first1=K.|title=Epidemiology: An Introduction|date=2002|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|isbn=0195135547}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is recall bias. A typical example is again provided by Sackett in his discussion of a study examining the effect of specific exposures on fetal health: "in questioning mothers whose recent pregnancies had ended in fetal death or malformation (cases) and a matched group of mothers whose pregnancies ended normally (controls) it was found that 28% of the former, but only 20% of the latter, reported exposure to drugs which could not be substantiated either in earlier prospective
interviews or in other health records".&lt;ref name="Sackett D. Bias in analytic research. J Chron Dis 1979; vol. 32:51–63." /&gt; In this example, recall bias probably occurred as a result of women who had had miscarriages having an apparent tendency to better recall and therefore report previous exposures.

==== Confounding ====
[[Confounding]] has traditionally been defined as bias arising from the co-occurrence or mixing of effects of extraneous factors, referred to as confounders, with the main effect(s) of interest.&lt;ref name=Rothman2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenland&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenland S, Morgenstern H | year = 2001 | title = Confounding in Health Research | url = http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.22.1.189 | journal = Annu. Rev. Public Health | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 189–212 | doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.22.1.189}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent definition of confounding invokes the notion of ''counterfactual'' effects.&lt;ref name=Greenland/&gt; According to this view, when one observes an outcome of interest, say Y=1 (as opposed to Y=0), in a given population A which is entirely exposed (i.e. exposure ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 for every unit of the population) the risk of this event will be ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;. The counterfactual or unobserved risk ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A0&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to the risk which would have been observed if these same individuals had been unexposed (i.e. ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for every unit of the population). The true effect of exposure therefore is: ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;A0&lt;/sub&gt; (if one is interested in risk differences) or ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;/''R''&lt;sub&gt;A0&lt;/sub&gt; (if one is interested in relative risk). Since the counterfactual risk ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A0&lt;/sub&gt; is unobservable we approximate it using a second population B and we actually measure the following relations: ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;B0&lt;/sub&gt; or ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;/''R''&lt;sub&gt;B0&lt;/sub&gt;. In this situation, confounding occurs when ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;B0&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Greenland/&gt; (NB: Example assumes binary outcome and exposure variables.)

Some epidemiologists prefer to think of confounding separately from common categorizations of bias since, unlike selection and information bias, confounding stems from real causal effects.&lt;ref name="Hernán2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hernán | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Hernández-Díaz | first2 = S. | last3 = Robins | first3 = J. M. | title = A structural approach to selection bias | journal = Epidemiology | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 615–625 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15308962 | doi=10.1097/01.ede.0000135174.63482.43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The profession ==
To date, few [[universities]] offer epidemiology as a course of study at the undergraduate level. One notable undergraduate program exists at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where students who major in public health can take graduate level courses, including epidemiology, their senior year at the [[Bloomberg School of Public Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Health Studies|url=http://krieger.jhu.edu/publichealth/|website=Public Health Studies at Johns Hopkins|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although epidemiologic research is conducted by individuals from diverse disciplines, including clinically trained professionals such as physicians, formal training is available through Masters or Doctoral programs including [[Master of Public Health]] (MPH), [[Master of Science]] of Epidemiology (MSc.), [[Doctor of Public Health]] (DrPH), [[Doctor of Pharmacy]] (PharmD), [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD), [[Doctor of Science]] (ScD).  Many other graduate programs, e.g., [[Doctor of Social Work]] (DSW), [[Doctor of Clinical Practice]] (DClinP), [[Doctor of Podiatric Medicine]] (DPM), [[Doctor of Veterinary Medicine]] (DVM), [[Doctor of Nursing Practice]] (DNP), [[Doctor of Physical Therapy]] (DPT), or for clinically trained physicians, [[Doctor of Medicine]] (MD) or [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery]] (MBBS or MBChB) and [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] (DO), include some training in epidemiologic research or related topics, but this training is generally substantially less than offered in training programs focused on epidemiology or public health. Reflecting the strong historical tie between epidemiology and medicine, formal training programs may be set in either schools of public health and medical schools.

As public health/health protection practitioners, epidemiologists work in a number of different settings. Some epidemiologists work 'in the field'; i.e., in the community, commonly in a public health/health protection service, and are often at the forefront of investigating and combating disease outbreaks. Others work for non-profit organizations, universities, hospitals and larger government entities such as state and local health departments, various Ministries of Health, [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors without Borders]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), the [[Health Protection Agency]], the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), or the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]]. Epidemiologists can also work in for-profit organizations such as pharmaceutical and medical device companies in groups such as market research or clinical development.

A '''first-person narrative''' is a [[narrative mode|mode of storytelling]] in which a narrator relays events from their own [[Narration#Narrative point of view|point of view]] using the [[grammatical person|first person ]] {{no wrap| i.e. "I" or "we", etc.}}&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview: First-person narrative|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095820156|website=Oxford Reference|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be narrated by a first person [[protagonist]] (or other [[focal character]]), first person re-teller, first person witness,&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt; or first person peripheral (also called a peripheral narrator).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Literature Glossary - First-person Narration|url=http://www.shmoop.com/literature-glossary/first-person-narration.html|website=Shmoop|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanzel1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanzel, F.K.|title=A Theory of Narrative|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uvs3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA208|date=13 March 1986|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-31063-5|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; A classic example of a first person protagonist narrator is [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' (1847),&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt; in which the [[title character]] is also the narrator telling her own story,&lt;ref name=schmoop1&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Eyre Narrator Point of View|url=http://www.shmoop.com/jane-eyre/narrator-point-of-view.html|website=Shmoop|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Examples of Writing in First Person|url=http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-writing-in-first-person.html#OlI0VVEcAI4abdEW.99|website=YourDictionary|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This device allows the audience to see the narrator's [[mind's eye]] view of the [[fictional universe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evers|first1=Stuart|title=The dangers of first-person narrative|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/may/13/thedangersoffirstpersonnar|accessdate=18 June 2017|work=The Guardian|date=13 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is limited to the narrator's experiences and awareness of the true state of affairs. In some stories, first-person narrators may relay dialogue with other characters or refer to information they heard from the other characters, in order to try to deliver a larger point of view.&lt;ref name=schmoop1/&gt; Other stories may switch the narrator to different characters to introduce a broader perspective. An [[unreliable narrator]] is one that has completely lost credibility due to ignorance, poor insight, personal biases, mistakes, dishonesty, etc., which challenges the reader's initial assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wiehardt|first1=Ginny|title=How to Recognize and Create an Unreliable Narrator|url=https://www.thebalance.com/the-unreliable-narrator-in-fiction-1277141|accessdate=18 June 2017|work=The Balance|date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Point of view device==
The telling of a story in the grammatical first person, i.e. from the perspective of "I." An example would be [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', which begins "Call me Ishmael."&lt;ref name=Perdue&gt;[https://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/narratology/terms/firstperson.html "First Person Narration", Perdue University College of Liberal Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;

First-person narration often includes an embedded listener or reader, who serves as the audience for the tale.&lt;ref name=Perdue/&gt; First-person narrations may be told by a person directly undergoing the events in the story without being aware of conveying that experience to readers; alternatively, the narrator may be conscious of telling the story to a given audience, perhaps at a given place and time, for a given reason.

===Identity===
A story written in the first person can be told by the main character, a less important character witnessing events, or a person retelling a story they were told by someone else. This point of view is often effective in giving a sense of closeness to the character.&lt;ref name=Ohio&gt;{{cite web|title=Point of View and Narrative Voice|url=http://www.ohio.edu/people/hartleyg/ref/fiction/pov.html|website=Literary Analysis|publisher=Ohio University|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reliability===
First-person narration presents the narrative through the perspective of a particular character. The reader or audience becomes aware of the events and characters of the story through the narrator's views and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://signbook.persiangig.com/document/literature/theory/raavi1.pdf Ranjbar Vahid. ''The Narrator'', Iran:Baqney. 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; As a participant in events, the conscious narrator, is an imperfect witness by definition, unable to fully see and comprehend events in their entirety as they unfurl, not necessarily objective in their inner thoughts or sharing them fully, and furthermore may be pursuing some hidden agenda. In some cases, the narrator may give or withhold information based on his own experience.

Character weaknesses and faults, such as tardiness, cowardice, or vice, may leave the narrator unintentionally absent or unreliable for certain key events. Specific events may further be colored or obscured by a narrator's background, since non-omniscient characters must by definition be laypersons and foreigners to some circles, and limitations such as poor eyesight and illiteracy may also leave important blanks. Another consideration is how much time has elapsed between when the character experienced the events of the story and when they decided to tell them. If only a few days have passed, the story could be related very differently than if the character was reflecting on events of the distant past. The character's motivation is also relevant. Are they just trying to clear up events for their own peace of mind? Make a confession about a wrong they did? Or tell a good adventure tale to their beer-guzzling friends? The reason why a story is told will also affect how it is written.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt; Why is this narrator telling the story in this way, why now, and is he to be trusted? Unstable or malevolent narrators can also lie to the reader. [[Unreliable narrators]] are not uncommon.

In the first-person-plural [[Narrative mode|point of view]], narrators tell the story using "we". That is, no individual speaker is identified; the narrator is a member of a group that acts as a unit. The first-person-plural point of view occurs rarely but can be used effectively, sometimes as a means to increase the concentration on the character or characters the story is about. Examples include:

* [[William Faulkner]]'s short story "[[A Rose for Emily]]" (Faulkner was an avid experimenter in using unusual points of view; see also his ''[[Spotted Horses]]'', told in third person plural).
* [[Frank B. Gilbreth]] and [[Ernestine Gilbreth Carey]]'s memoir ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen]]''.
* [[Theodore Sturgeon]]'s short story "Crate."
* [[Frederik Pohl]]'s ''[[Man Plus]]''.
* [[Jeffrey Eugenides]]'s ''[[The Virgin Suicides]]''.
* [[Karen Joy Fowler]]'s ''[[The Jane Austen Book Club]]''.
* [[Joshua Ferris]]'s ''[[Then We Came to the End]]''.
* [http://thenormalschool.com/fiction/ Heidi Vornbrock Roosa's short story "Our Mother Who Art."]

Other examples include ''[[Twenty-Six Men and a Girl]]'' by [[Maxim Gorky]], ''The Treatment of Bibi Haldar'' by [[Jhumpa Lahiri]], ''During the Reign of the Queen of Persia'' by [[Joan Chase]], ''Our Kind'' by [[Kate Walbert]], ''[[I, Robot]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]], and ''We Didn't'' by [[Stuart Dybek]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E3DF1538F93BA25757C0A9629C8B63|title=We the Characters|publisher=[[The New York Times|nytimes.com]]|accessdate=2007-02-25|date=April 18, 2004 | first=Laura | last=Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First-person narrators can also be multiple, as in [[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]]'s ''[[In a Grove]]'' (the source for the movie ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'') and [[William Faulkner|Faulkner's]] novel ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]''. Each of these sources provides different accounts of the same event, from the point of view of various first-person narrators.

There can also be multiple co-principal characters as narrator, such as in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]''. The first chapter introduces four characters, including the initial narrator, who is named at the beginning of the chapter. The narrative continues in subsequent chapters with a different character explicitly identified as the narrator for that chapter. Other characters later introduced in the book also have their "own" chapters where they narrate the story for that chapter. The story proceeds in linear fashion, and no event occurs more than once, i.e. no two narrators speak "live" about the same event.

The first-person narrator may be the principal character or one who closely observes the principal character (see [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' or [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', each narrated by a minor character). These can be distinguished as "first person major" or "first person minor" points of view.

The narrator can be the [[protagonist]] (e.g., [[Lemuel Gulliver|Gulliver]] in ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''), someone very close to him who is privy to his thoughts and actions ([[Dr. Watson]] in [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories), or an ancillary character who has little to do with the action of the story (such as Nick Carraway in ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''). Narrators can report others' narratives at one or more removes. These are called "frame narrators": examples are Mr. Lockwood, the narrator in ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' by [[Emily Brontë]]; and the unnamed narrator in ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' by [[Joseph Conrad]]. Skilled writers choose to skew narratives, in keeping with the narrator's character, to an arbitrary degree, from ever so slight to extreme. For example, the aforementioned Mr. Lockwood is quite naive, of which fact he appears unaware, simultaneously rather pompous, and recounting a combination of stories, experiences, and servants' gossip. As such, his character is an unintentionally very unreliable narrator, and serves mainly to mystify, confuse, and ultimately leave the events of Wuthering Heights open to a great range of interpretations.

A rare form of first person is the first person omniscient, in which the narrator is a character in the story, but also knows the thoughts and feelings of all the other characters. It can seem like third person omniscient at times. A reasonable explanation fitting the mechanics of the story's world is generally provided or inferred, unless its glaring absence is a major plot point. Two notable examples are ''[[The Book Thief]]'' by [[Markus Zusak]], where the narrator is [[Death]], and ''[[The Lovely Bones]]'' by [[Alice Sebold]], where a young girl, having been killed, observes, from some post-mortem, [[Out-of-body experience|extracorporeal]] viewpoint, her family struggling to cope with her disappearance. Typically, however, the narrator restricts the events relayed in the narrative to those that could reasonably be known. Novice writers may make the mistake of allowing elements of omniscience into a first-person narrative unintentionally and at random, forgetting the inherent human limitations of a witness or participant of the events.

==Autobiography==
In [[Biography in literature|autobiographical fiction]], the first person narrator is the character of the author (with varying degrees of historical accuracy). The narrator is still distinct from the author and must behave like any other character and any other first person narrator. Examples of this kind of narrator include [[Jim Carroll]] in ''[[The Basketball Diaries]]'' and [[Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.]] in ''[[Timequake]]'' (in this case, the first-person narrator is also the author). In some cases, the narrator is writing a book—"the book in your hands"—and therefore he has most of the powers and knowledge of the author. Examples include ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' by [[Umberto Eco]], and ''[[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]]'' by [[Mark Haddon]]. Another example is a fictional "Autobiography of James T. Kirk"  which was "Edited" by David A. Goodman who was the actual writer of that book and playing the part of James Kirk (Gene Roddenberry's '''Star Trek''') as he wrote the novel.

==Detective fiction==
Since the narrator is within the story, he or she may not have knowledge of all the events. For this reason, first-person narrative is often used for [[detective fiction]], so that the reader and narrator uncover the case together. One traditional approach in this form of fiction is for the main detective's principal assistant, the "Watson", to be the narrator: this derives from the character of [[Doctor Watson|Dr Watson]] in [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's]] [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories.

==Forms==
First-person narratives can appear in several forms; interior monologue, as in [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[Notes from Underground]]''; dramatic monologue, also in [[Albert Camus]]' ''[[The Fall (Albert Camus novel)|The Fall]]''; or explicitly, as [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]].''

Other forms include temporary first-person narration as a [[story within a story]], wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the focal character.

==Styles==
With a first person narrative it is important to consider how the story is being told, i.e., is the character writing it down, telling it out loud, thinking it to themselves? And if they are writing it down, is it something meant to be read by the public, a private diary, or a story meant for one other person? The way the first person narrator is relating the story will affect the language used, the length of sentences, the tone of voice and many other things. A story presented as a secret diary could be interpreted much differently than a public statement.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt;

First-person narratives can tend towards a [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]] and [[Monologue|Interior monologue]], as in [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''. The whole of the narrative can itself be presented as a [[false document]], such as a diary, in which the narrator makes explicit reference to the fact that he is writing or telling a story. This is the case in [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]''. As a story unfolds, narrators may be aware that they are telling a story and of their reasons for telling it. The audience that they believe they are addressing can vary. In some cases, a [[frame story]] presents the narrator as a character in an outside story who begins to tell his own story, as in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]''.

First-person narrators are often [[unreliable narrator]]s since a narrator might be impaired (such as both Quentin and Benjy in Faulkner's ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]''), lie (as in ''[[The Quiet American]]'' by [[Graham Greene]], or ''[[The Book of the New Sun]]'' series by [[Gene Wolfe]]), or manipulate their own memories intentionally or not (as in ''[[The Remains of the Day]]'' by [[Kazuo Ishiguro]], or in [[Ken Kesey]]'s [[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'']]). [[Henry James]] discusses his concerns about "the romantic privilege of the 'first person'" in his preface to ''[[The Ambassadors]]'', calling it "the darkest abyss of [[Romanticism|romance]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goetz |first=William R. |title=Henry James and the Darkest Abyss of Romance |year=1986 |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |location=Baton Rouge |isbn=0-8071-1259-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=35807&amp;pageno=11 ''The Ambassadors'' (p. 11) on Project Gutenberg] Accessed 17 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a multi-level narrative structure is [[Joseph Conrad]]'s novella ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', which has a double framework: an unidentified "I" (first person singular) narrator relates a boating trip during which another character, Marlow, uses first person to tell a story that comprises the majority of the work. Within this nested story, it is mentioned that another character, Kurtz, told Marlow a lengthy story; however, its content is not revealed to readers. Thus, there is an "I" narrator introducing a storyteller as "he" (Marlow), who talks about himself as "I" and introduces another storyteller as "he" (Kurtz), who in turn presumably told his story from the perspective of "I".

==Film==
First person narration is more difficult to achieve in film; however, voice-over narration can create the same structure.&lt;ref name=Perdue/&gt;

[[File:Flotsam on Terschelling.JPG|thumb|Flotsam on a beach at [[Terschelling]], [[Wadden Sea]]]]

In [[maritime law]], ''flotsam'', ''jetsam'', ''lagan'', and ''derelict'' are specific kinds of [[shipwreck]]. The words have specific nautical meanings, with legal consequences in the [[law of admiralty]] and [[marine salvage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rd.com/slideshows/8-amusing-stories-behind-common-expressions/6/|title=8 Amusing Stories Behind Common Expressions &amp;#124; Reader's Digest|publisher=Rd.com|date=2011-11-13 |accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shipwreck is defined as the remains of a ship that has been wrecked, a destroyed ship at sea, whether it be sunken or floating on the surface of the water.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge English Dictionary. "Shipwreck definition.": http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/shipwreck&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
A wreck is categorized as property belonging to no apparent owner, that either sinks to the seabed, or floats on the surface of the water, whether it be intentionally cast overboard, or as the result of an accident. The term encompasses the hull of the vessel and its fixtures, as well as any other form of object on board, such as cargo and stores, and personal effects of the crew and passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1057-2414(99)80024-7 |title=A note on the meaning of 'wreck' |journal=The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=319 |year=1999 |last1=Dromgoole |first1=S }}&lt;/ref&gt; This also encompasses the narrower definition of salvage, that is, property that has been recovered from a wreckage, or the recovery of the ship itself.
 
There are a number of factors that contribute to the formation of a shipwreck, that can be divided into physical and cultural processes. A site can be affected by physical processes, that is, naturally occurring processes, such as the corrosion caused by salinity and [[ocean current]]s, or the growth of native and foreign marine organisms. It can also be affected by cultural processes, that is, by human interactions, such as adding or removing materials from the site of the wreck. Any archaeological activity, such as excavation, may also be considered invasive and tampering.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew E. Keith, Society for Historical Archaeology. "Site formation processes of submerged shipwrecks." University Press of Florida (2016){{page needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of maritime law, different meanings are attributed to the terms, based on what the jurisdiction is, as well as the context. For example, a distinction is made between goods that wash ashore, from those that are for some reason not salvageable and/or lost at sea.

==Law of salvage==
Ownership of a wreck is a highly controversial issue, as there are no clear lines within which it is defined. It may be acquired through various means that range from succession to confiscation. There is also a distinction to be made between the ownership of the hull itself and the cargo it contains, as the hull may be abandoned intentionally, whereas the cargo may be out of necessity (in the case of an emergency or the need to shed weight from the vessel). In these parameters, abandonment of the ship by its passengers constitutes as a loss of possession, but to abandon the claim on the title itself, intention to relinquish it is required. This affects wrecks by limiting that which is considered "abandoned". Generally, a ship is defined as "abandoned" if there is no hope of recovery, known legally as ''Sine spe recuperandi'' (which is the Latin phrase for "no hope of recovery"), and this fact must be clearly proven by the salvaging party. It must also occur on [[Navigability|navigable waters]].
 
The term "salvage" is used to indicate a salvage operation, as well as the subsequent awarded compensation. It is considered a voluntary service rendered in cases such as danger to the wreck, or the surrounding navigable waters. In terms of compensation, it is seen as being awarded to anyone who voluntarily assisted in the recuperation of the wreck, whether it be saved from upcoming danger, or from loss.

The [[Law of salvage|Law of Salvage]] finds its origins in the Roman practice of ''[[negotiorum gestio]]'', which dictated that one who preserved or improved upon the property of another, was owed compensation from the owner, even if the service was not requested by the latter. The law did not apply to maritime regulations, but were the basis for following ordinances, such as the Marine Ordinance of Trani, which stated that a "finder" was to be rewarded, whether the owner claimed the goods or not. The laws have evolved since ''negotiorum gestio'', and today, in the United States, a salvor who voluntarily brings the goods back into port may legally lay claim to them, or deliver them to a marshal, in return for a reward.&lt;ref name="Norris"&gt;Norris, Martin J."The Law of Salvage". Baker, Voorhis (1958)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flotsam==
{{redirect|Flotsam}}
Also known as "flotsan", the term "flotsam" refers to a sunken vessel whose goods float to the surface of the sea, or any floating cargo that is cast overboard.&lt;ref name="Norris"/&gt;

In terms of maritime law, the definition of flotsam pertains to goods that are floating on the surface of the water as the result of a wreck or an accident. As there is no clear way of defining ownership, one who discovers flotsam is allowed to claim it, unless someone claims ownership to the items in question.&lt;ref name="Colombia Electronic Encyclopedia"&gt;Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition. "Flotsam, jetsam, and ligan". (2016): http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=d8a46f34-d331-4ea7-89bf-e68724ce16ed%40sessionmgr4008&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=4107&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=39006707&amp;db=aph&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jetsam==
{{redirect|Jetsam}}
The term "jetsam" designates any cargo that is intentionally discarded from a ship or wreckage. Legally jetsam also floats, although floating is not part of the etymological meaning. &lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/jetsam | title = jetsam | website = Oxford Living Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, "jettisoning" connotes the action of throwing goods overboard to lighten the load of the ship if it is in danger of being sunk.&lt;ref name="Norris"/&gt;

Per maritime law, one who discovers these artifacts is required to return them to their rightful owner only in the case that the latter makes a legally abiding claim.&lt;ref name="Colombia Electronic Encyclopedia"/&gt;

Although, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration "flotsam may be claimed by the original owner, whereas jetsam may be claimed as property of whoever discovers it".&lt;ref&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration web page [https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/flotsam-jetsam.html What are Flotsam and Jetsam]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lagan==
[[File:NOAA-NDBC-discus-buoy.jpg |thumb|right|125px|A buoy is sufficient to retain claim to an attached artifact]]

Also called "ligan", the term refers to goods that are cast overboard and are heavy enough to sink to the ocean floor, but are tied or otherwise linked to a floating marker, such as a [[buoy]] or cork, so that they can be found again by whoever marked the item. Lagan can also refer to large objects that are trapped within the sinking vessel.&lt;ref name="Norris"/&gt;

According to maritime law, a buoy, or otherwise floating object, constitutes as sufficient grounds in laying claim to an artifact. In other words, when faced with a lagan, one is required to return the artifact to its rightful owner.&lt;ref name="Colombia Electronic Encyclopedia"/&gt;

==Derelict==
"Derelict" can refer to goods that have sunk to the ocean floor, relinquished willingly or forcefully by its owner, and thus abandoned, but which no one has any hope of reclaiming.

In terms of maritime law, derelict is considered property abandoned on navigable waters which has no hope of being recovered, or ''sine spe recuperandi'', and no expectation of it being returned to its owner, or ''sine animo revertendi''.&lt;ref name="Norris"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5514">'''Geographical features''' are naturally-created features of the Earth. Natural geographical features consist of [[landform]]s and [[ecosystem]]s. For example, terrain types,  physical factors of the environment) are natural geographical features. Conversely, [[human settlement]]s or other engineered forms are considered types of artificial geographical features.

==Natural geographical features==
===Ecosystems ===
{{main|Ecosystem}}
There are two different terms to describe habitats: ecosystem and biome. An ecosystem is a community of organisms interacting with its environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Odum|first1=Eugene P.|authorlink1=Eugene Odum|last2=Odum|first2=Howard T.|authorlink2=Howard Thomas Odum|title=Fundamentals of Ecology|date=1971|publisher=[[Saunders (imprint)|Saunders]]|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[biomes]] occupy large areas of the globe and often encompass many different kinds of geographical features, including [[mountain range]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Botkin|first1=Daniel B.|last2=Keller|first2=Edward A.|title=Environmental Science: Earth as a Living Planet|date=1995|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biotic diversity within an ecosystem is the variability among living organisms from all sources, including ''[[inter alia]]'', terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention Text — Article 2. Use of Terms|url=https://www.cbd.int/convention/articles/default.shtml?a=cbd-02|website=www.CBD.int|publisher=Convention on Biological Diversity|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Living organism]]s are continually engaged in a set of relationships with every other element constituting  the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] in which they exist, and ecosystem describes any situation where there is relationship between organisms and their environment.

Biomes represent large areas of ecologically similar [[Community (ecology)|communities]] of [[plants]], [[animals]], and soil organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Basak|first1=Anindita|title=Environmental Studies|date=2009|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|isbn=978-81-317-2118-6|page=288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yElrhPSIq-wC&amp;pg=PA288&amp;lpg=PA288&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5kosDjw1GB&amp;sig=sEgYEQI_FrGmo8FSbGx2PrjlT_A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=%22geographically-defined%20area%20of%20ecologically%20similar%20communities%20of%20plants%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomes are defined based on factors such as plant structures (such as trees, shrubs, and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needleleaf), plant spacing (forest, woodland, savanna), and climate. Unlike [[ecozones]], biomes are not defined by genetic, taxonomic, or historical similarities. Biomes are often identified with particular patterns of [[ecological succession]] and [[climax vegetation]].

== Landforms ==
{{main|Landform}}
A landform comprises a [[geomorphology|geomorphological]] unit and is largely defined by its surface form and location in the landscape, as part of the [[terrain]], and as such is typically an element of [[topography]].  Landforms are categorized by features such as elevation, slope, orientation, [[stratum|stratification]], rock exposure, and soil type. They include [[berm]]s, mounds, hills, [[cliffs]], [[valleys]], [[rivers]], and numerous other elements.  [[Oceans]] and [[continents]] are the highest-order landforms.

A '''body of water''' is any significant accumulation of water, usually covering the Earth. The term "body of water" most often refers to [[ocean]]s, [[sea]]s, and [[lake]]s, but it may also include smaller pools of water such as [[pond]]s, [[creek (tidal)|creeks]] or [[wetland]]s. [[River]]s, [[stream]]s, [[canal]]s, and other geographical features where water moves from one place to another are not always considered bodies of water, but they are included as geographical formations featuring water.

== Artificial geographical features ==
=== Settlement ===
{{main|Human settlement}}
A settlement is a permanent or temporary [[community]] in which people live. Settlements range in components from a small number of dwellings grouped together to the largest of cities with surrounding urbanized areas. Other landscape features such as roads, enclosures, field systems, boundary banks and ditches, ponds, parks and woods, mills, manor houses, moats, and churches may be considered part of a settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSRG Policy Statement|url=http://medieval-settlement.com/about/policy/|website=Medieval-Settlement.com|publisher=Medieval Settlement Research Group|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engineered constructs ===
{{main|Construction engineering|Building|Nonbuilding structure}}
{{See also|Infrastructure}}
Engineered geographic features include [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[airport]]s, [[railroad]]s, [[building]]s, [[dam]]s, and [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]], and are part of the [[anthroposphere]] because they are man-made geographic features.

== Cartographic features ==
{{main|Cartography|Map}}
Cartographic features are types of abstract geographical features, which appear on maps but not on the planet itself, even though they are located on the planet. For example, the [[Equator]] is shown on maps of the Earth, but it does not physically exist. It is a theoretical line used for reference, navigation, and measurement.

In [[evolutionary developmental biology]], '''heterochrony''' is a developmental change in the timing or rate of events, leading to changes in size and shape.  It is contrasted with [[heterotopy]], a change in spatial positioning of some process in the embryo, which can also create morphological innovation. Following the framework of Reilly ''et al'',&lt;ref name=Reilly1997&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Reilly |first=Stephen M. |last2=Wiley |first2=E.O. |last3=Meinhardt |first3=Daniel J. |date=1997-01-01 |title=An integrative approach to heterochrony: the distinction between interspecific and intraspecific phenomena |url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1997.tb01487.x |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=119–143 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1997.tb01487.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; heterochrony can be divided into intraspecific heterochrony that explains variation within a species, and interspecific heterochrony that explains developmental variation [[phylogeny|phylogenetically]], in the timing or rate of events of a descendent species with respect to an ancestral species.

These changes all affect the start, end, rate, or timespan of a particular developmental process.&lt;ref name="Held152"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Held |first1=Lewis I. |authorlink=Lewis Held |title=[[How the Snake Lost its Legs]]. Curious Tales from the Frontier of Evo-Devo |date=2014 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-1-107-62139-8 |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of heterochrony was introduced by [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1875,&lt;ref name=Horder&gt;{{cite book |author=Horder, Tim |chapter=Heterochrony |title=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=Chichester |date=April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=B. K. |title=Evo-Devo: evolutionary developmental mechanisms |journal=International Journal of Developmental Biology |date=2003 |volume=47 |issue=7–8 |pages=491–495 |pmid=14756324}}&lt;/ref&gt; and given its modern sense by [[Gavin de Beer]] in 1930.

==History==
[[File:Haeckel vs von Baer.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Ernst Haeckel]] supposed that embryonic development [[recapitulation theory|recapitulated]] an animal's phylogeny, and introduced heterochrony as an exception for individual organs. Modern biology agrees instead with [[Karl Ernst von Baer]]'s view that development itself varies, such as by changing the timing of different processes, to cause a branching phylogeny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=B. K. |title=Evo-Devo: evolutionary developmental mechanisms |journal=International Journal of Developmental Biology |date=2003 |volume=47 |issue=7-8 |pages=491–495 |pmid=14756324}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{further|Evolutionary developmental biology}}

The concept of heterochrony was introduced by the German zoologist [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1875, where he used it to define deviations from [[recapitulation theory]], which held that "[[ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]]".&lt;ref name=Horder/&gt; As [[Stephen Jay Gould]] pointed out, Haeckel's term is now used in a sense contrary to his coinage. He assumed that [[embryonic development]] (ontogeny) of "higher" animals recapitulated their ancestral development ([[phylogeny]]). This, in his view, necessarily compressed the earlier developmental stages, representing the ancestors, into a shorter time, meaning accelerated development. The ideal for Haeckel would be when the development of every part of an organism was thus accelerated, but he recognised that some organs could develop with displacements in position ([[heterotopy]], another concept he originated) or time (heterochrony), as exceptions to his rule. He thus intended the term to mean a change in the timing of the embryonic development of one organ with respect to the rest of the same animal, whereas it is now used, following the work of the British evolutionary embryologist [[Gavin de Beer]] in 1930, to mean a change with respect to the development of the same organ in the animal's ancestors.&lt;ref name=Gould1988&gt;{{cite book |author=Gould, Stephen J. |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |year=1988 |title=The Uses of Heterochrony |editor=McKinney, M.L. |work=Heterochrony in Evolution.

In 1928, the English embryologist [[Walter Garstang]] showed that [[tunicate]] larvae shared structures such as the [[notochord]] with adult vertebrates, and suggested that the vertebrates arose by paedomorphosis (neoteny) from such a larva.&lt;ref name="McNamara2012"/&gt;

De Beer anticipated evolutionary developmental biology in his 1930 book ''[[Embryos and Ancestors]]'',&lt;ref name="Held"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Held |first1=Lewis I. |title=How the Snake Lost its Legs.

'''Intraspecific heterochrony''' means changes in the rate or timing of development within a species. For example, some individuals of the salamander species ''Ambystoma talpoideum'' delay the metamorphosis of the skull.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Reilly |first=Stephen M. |date=February 1987 |title=Ontogeny of the hyobranchial apparatus in the salamanders Ambystoma talpoideum (Ambystomatidae) and Notophthalmus viridescens (Salamandridae): The ecological morphology of two neotenic strategies |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmor.1051910210/abstract |journal=Journal of Morphology |volume=191 |issue=2 |pages=205–214 |doi=10.1002/jmor.1051910210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reilley ''et al'' argue we can define these variant individuals as ''paedotypic'' (with truncated development relative to the ancestral condition), ''peratypic'' (with extended development relative to the ancestral condition), or  ''isotypic'' (reaching the same ancestral shape, but via a different mechanism).&lt;ref name="Reilly1997"/&gt;

'''Interspecific heterochrony''' means differences in the rate or timing of a descendent species relative to its ancestor. This can result in either ''paedomophosis'' (truncating the ancestral ontogeny), ''peramorphosis'' (extending past the ancestral ontogeny), or ''isomorphosis'' (reaching the same ancestral state via a different mechanism).&lt;ref name="Reilly1997"/&gt;

*'''Onset''': A developmental process can either begin earlier, ''pre-displacement'', extending its development, or later, ''post-displacement'', truncating it.
*'''Offset''': A process can either end later, ''hypermorphosis'', extending its development, or earlier, ''hypomorphosis'' or ''progenesis'', truncating it.
*'''Rate''': The rate of a process can accelerate, extending its development, or decelerate (as in neoteny), truncating it.

A dramatic illustration of how acceleration can change a [[body plan]] is seen in [[snake]]s. Where a typical vertebrate like a mouse has only around 60 vertebrae, snakes have between around 150 to 400, giving them extremely long spinal columns and enabling their sinuous [[animal locomotion|locomotion]]. Snake embryos achieve this by accelerating their system for creating [[somite]]s (body segments), which relies on an oscillator.  The oscillator clock runs some four times faster in snake than in mouse embryos, initially creating very thin somites. These expand to adopt a typical vertebrate shape, elongating the body.&lt;ref name="Held81"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Held |first1=Lewis I. |title=How the Snake Lost its Legs.

[[Giraffes]] gain their long necks by a different heterochrony, extending the development of their cervical vertebrae; they retain the usual mammalian number of these vertebrae, seven.&lt;ref name=Hillis2011/&gt; This number appears to be constrained by the use of neck somites to form the mammalian [[Diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] muscle; the result is that the embryonic neck is divided into three modules, the middle one (C3 to C5) serving the diaphragm. The assumption is that disrupting this would kill the embryo rather than giving it more vertebrae.&lt;ref name="Held126"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Held |first1=Lewis I. |title=How the Snake Lost its Legs.

==Detection==
Heterochrony can be identified by comparing [[phylogenetically]] close species, for example a group of different bird species whose legs differ in their average length. These comparisons are complex because there are no universal ontogenetic timemarkers. The method of event pairing attempts to overcome this by comparing the relative timing of two events at a time.&lt;ref name=Velhagen&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Velhagen |first1=W.

Paedomorphosis can be the result of [[neoteny]], the retention of juvenile traits into the adult form as a result of retardation of somatic development, or of progenesis, the acceleration of developmental processes such that the juvenile form becomes a sexually mature adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first=Charles Kay |year=1990 |title=A model for understanding the evolution of mammalian behavior |journal=Current Mammalogy |volume=2 |pages=335–374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Progenesis (or paedogenesis) can be observed in the [[axolotl]] (''Ambystoma mexicanum''). Axolotls reach full sexual maturity while retaining their fins and gills (in other words, still in the juvenile form of their ancestors).They will remain in aquatic environments in this truncated developmental form, rather than moving onto land as other sexually mature salamander species.

===Peramorphosis===
[[File:Irish Elk front.jpg|thumb|left|[[Irish elk]] skeleton with antlers spanning {{convert|2.7|m|ft}} and a mass of {{convert|40|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}]]

Peramorphosis is delayed maturation with extended periods of growth. An example is the extinct [[Irish elk]]. From the fossil record, its antlers spanned up to 12 feet wide, which is about a third larger than the antlers of its close relative the moose. The Irish elk had larger antlers due to extended development during their period of growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Futuyma |first=Douglas |title=Evolution |year=2013 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, MA |isbn=1605351156 |pages=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ron A.

Another example of peramorphosis is seen in insular (island) rodents. Their characteristics include gigantism, wider cheek and teeth, reduced [[Litter (animal)|litter]] size, and longer lifespan. Their relatives that inhabit continental environments are much smaller. Insular rodents have evolved these features to accommodate the abundance of food and resources they have on their islands. These factors are part of a complex phenomenon termed Island syndrome.&lt;ref name=Raia2010&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pasquale Raia|author2=Fabio M Guarino|author3=Mimmo Turano|author4=Gianluca Polese|author5=Daniela Rippa|author6=Francesco Carotenuto|author7=Daria M Monti|author8=Manuela Cardi|author9=Domenico Fulgione |title=The blue lizard spandrel and the island syndrome |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |year=2010 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=289 |doi=10.1186/1471-2148-10-289 |display-authors=etal |pmid=20854657 |pmc=2949876}}&lt;/ref&gt; With less [[predation]] and competition for resources, selection favored overdevelopment of these species. Reduced litter sizes enable overdevelopment of their bodies into larger ones.

The [[mole salamander]], a close relative to the axolotl, displays both paedomorphosis and paramorphosis. The larva can develop in either direction. Population density, food, and the amount of water may have an effect on the expression of heterochrony. A study conducted on the mole salamander in 1987 found it evident that a higher percentage of individuals became paedomorphic when there was a low larval population density in a constant water level as opposed to a high larval population density in drying water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Semlitsch, Raymond D. |title=Paedomorphosis in Ambystoma talpoideum: effects of density, food, and pond drying |journal=Ecology |year=1987 |pages=992–1002 |doi=10.2307/1938370 |volume=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had an implication that led to hypotheses that selective pressures imposed by the environment, such as predation and loss of resources, were instrumental to the cause of these trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. Denoel|author2=P. Joly |title=Neoteny and progenesis as two heterochronic processes involved in paedomorphosis in Triturus alpestris (Amphibia: Caudata) |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |year=2000 |volume=267 |series=B |issue=1451 |pages=1481–1485 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1168|pmc=1690691 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas were reinforced by other studies, such as peramorphosis in the Puerto Rican [[Tree frog]]. Another reason could be generation time, or the lifespan of the species in question. When a species has a relatively short lifespan, natural selection favors evolution of paedomorphosis (e.g. Axolotl: 7–10 years). Conversely, in long lifespans natural selection favors evolution of peramorphosis (e.g. Irish Elk: 20–22 years).&lt;ref name=Raia2010/&gt;

{{further|Neoteny in humans}}

Several heterochronies have been described in humans, relative to the [[chimpanzee]]. In chimpanzee [[fetus]]es, brain and head growth starts at about the same developmental stage and grow at a rate similar to that of humans, but growth stops soon after birth, whereas humans continue brain and head growth several years after birth. This particular type of heterochrony, hypermorphosis, involves a delay in the offset of a developmental process, or what is the same, the presence of an early developmental process in later stages of development. Humans have some 30 different [[neoteny|neotenies]] in comparison to the chimpanzee, retaining larger heads, smaller jaws and noses, and shorter limbs, features found in juvenile chimpanzees.&lt;ref name="Mietal04"&gt;{{cite journal |date=June 2004 |title=Comparison of cranial ontogenetic trajectories among great apes and humans |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0047248404000521 |journal=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14717">An '''international medical graduate''' ('''IMG'''), earlier known as a '''foreign medical graduate''' ('''FMG'''), is a [[physician]] who has graduated from a medical school outside of the country where he or she intends to practice. Generally, the medical school of graduation is one listed in the [[International Medical Education Directory]] (IMED) as accredited by the [[Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research]] or the [[World Health Organization]].

Medical schools around the world vary in education standards, curricula, and evaluation methods. Many countries have their own certification program, equivalent to the ECFMG in the United States. The purpose of [[ECFMG]] Certification is to assess the readiness of international medical graduates to enter clinical specialty training programs as [[resident physician]]s and fellowship programs in the United States.

== License requirements by country ==

The requirements to obtain a license to practice varies by country and often by state or province.

===Australia===
{{main article|Overseas trained doctors in Australia}}

IMGs (or Overseas Trained Doctors) who wish to be licensed in [[Australia]] must apply to the [[Australian Medical Council|Australian Medical Council (AMC)]] to arrange an appropriate assessment pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amc.org.au/index.php/pub/downloads/359-applying-to-amc|title=IMG guides:   Applying to the Australian Medical Council| publisher= Australian Medical Council |date=27 February 2012 |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard pathway involves an IMG sitting a series of assessments, including AMC MCQ Exam and AMC clinical exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amc.org.au/index.php/ass/apo/sp |title= Assessments &amp; examinations: Standard pathway| publisher= Australian Medical Council |date=27 February 2012 |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMC MCQ Exam consists of 150 MCQs organized through computer adaptive scoring.

For AMC clinical exam, a candidate is required to pass 12 out of 16 cases including one compulsory case in each of Gyne and pediatrics.

Those IMGs who have passed the necessary exams and obtained AMC certification can then apply to an Australian specialty training positions.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080613222254/http://www.amc.org.au/prelim1.asp]

Australia is in the process of establishing a national registration process for all the doctors under Medical Board of Australia.

In 2010 the [[Minister for Health and Ageing (Australia)]] launched an [[Inquiry process into registration and accreditation processes for international medical graduates]] which reported in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House_of_Representatives_Committees?url=haa/overseasdoctors/report.htm | title=Inquiry into Registration Processes and Support for Overseas Trained Doctors | publisher= Parliament of Australia | accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Several organizations have put pressure on the government such as the Association For Access to Health Care Services, and Association of International Physicians and Surgeons of [[Ontario]]. Bill 97, Increasing Access to Qualified Health Professionals for Ontarians Act, was passed in 2008, requiring the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada|College of Physicians and Surgeons]] to provide adequate numbers of doctors by issuing transitional licenses. However, the college has not complied with the law.

In addition to undergoing the regular licensing process as required of all Canadian medical school graduates, IMGs must pass the [[Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada|LMCC]] Evaluating Examination. IMGs in Canada also have a harder time getting into residency programs compared to Canadian graduates &amp;mdash; only ten percent of IMG applicants get a position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readersdigest.ca/health/healthy-living/why-canada-shutting-out-doctors readersdigest.ca - Why Is Canada Shutting Out Doctors?]: "In 2003, 625 international graduates competed. Only 67—about ten percent—found a position"&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduates of United States M.D. programs are ''not'' considered IMGs and are thus exempt from the Evaluating Examination; graduates of U.S. osteopathic medical schools ''are'' considered IMGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcc.ca/en/exams/ee/apply.shtml |title=Evaluating Examination: Apply |publisher=Medical Council of Canada |accessdate=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{update section|date=December 2017}}
[[Image:2007ACGME-2.PNG|250px|right]][[Image:2007ACGME-3.PNG|250px|right]]
Graduates of Canadian M.D. programs are ''not'' considered IMGs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfmg.org/2010ib/ibfaq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions: 1.

The purpose of ECFMG Certification is to assess whether graduates of these schools are ready to enter U.S. residency and fellowship programs that are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian physician with an [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MBBS]] are qualified to take the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|USMLE]]. However, since the 2010s, the process of obtaining a license was becoming increasingly complicated&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/business/economy/long-slog-for-foreign-doctors-to-practice-in-us.html&lt;/ref&gt; India has exported more physicians to the United States than any other foreign nation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16774871&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pathway====
The main pathway for IMGs who wish to be licensed as physicians in the [[United States]] is to complete a U.S. [[residency (medicine)|residency]] hospital program. The general method to apply for residency programs is through the [[National Resident Matching Program]] (abbreviated NRMP, also called "the Match"). To participate in the NRMP, an IMG is required to have an [[ECFMG certification]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/ind_app/verif_new.html nrmp.org &gt; Independent Applicants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721084648/http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/ind_app/verif_new.html |date=2011-07-21 }} Updated 09/08/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; by the "rank order list certification deadline" time (usually in February of the year of the match).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/yearly.html nrmp.org &gt; 2012 Main Match Schedule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716035954/http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/yearly.html |date=2011-07-16 }} Updated 05/19/2011&lt;/ref&gt; To acquire an ECFMG certification, the main requirements are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfmg.org/2011ib/ibmec.html ecfmg.org &gt; Medical Education Credentials] Last update: September 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Completion of [[USMLE Step 1]], [[USMLE Step 2 Clinical Knowledge]] and [[USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills]]
*A medical diploma of [[medical education]] taken at an institution registered in the [[International Medical Education Directory]] (IMED)
In comparison, regular graduates from medical schools in the United States and Canada need to complete USMLE Steps 1 and 2 as well, but can participate in the NRMP while still doing their final year of medical school before acquiring their medical diplomas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/us_seniors/registration.html nrmp.org &gt; U.S. Seniors &gt; Registering with the NRMP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721084824/http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/us_seniors/registration.html |date=2011-07-21 }} Updated August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, taking regular administrative delays into account, and with residency programs starting around July, there is a gap of at least half a year for IMGs between graduation from medical school and beginning of a residency program.

Those IMGs who have passed the necessary [[USMLE]] exams and obtained the ECFMG certification can then apply to U.S. residency positions via the [[NRMP]] and [[Electronic Residency Application Service|ERAS]].

USMLE exam scores are considered in the [[National Resident Matching Program#International medical graduates|matching process]] for entering a residency program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Catherine Rampell|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/business/economy/long-slog-for-foreign-doctors-to-practice-in-us.html|title=Path to United States Practice Is Long Slog to Foreign Doctors|publisher=New York Times|date=August 11, 2018|access-date=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study came to the result that almost half of IMGs were unsuccessful in their first attempts in the pursuit of a U.S. residency position, and three-quarters began a residency after five years.&lt;ref name=jolly2011&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/742193?src=mp&amp;spon=25 Participation in U.S. Graduate Medical Education by Graduates of International Medical Schools] By Jolly, Paul PhD; Boulet, John PhD; Garrison, Gwen PhD; Signer, Mona M. MPH. Posted: 05/23/2011; ''Academic Medicine''. 2011;86(5):559-564.&lt;/ref&gt; It also indicated that IMGs were considerably older when they first applied for a residency position than are most U.S. medical graduates, with mean age of IMGs when the ECFMG certificate was issued being 32.4 years, with a standard deviation of 5.8 years.&lt;ref name=jolly2011/&gt;

All applicants to residency programs in [[California]] need a ''{{visible anchor|Postgraduate Training Authorization Letter}}'' (PTAL), colloquially called a "California Letter".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ö/www.ecfmg.org/eras/applicants-documents-pta.html Postgraduate Training Authorization Letter (PTAL) or “California Letter”], [[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates]]. Last updated June 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Obtainment of a PTAL requires graduation from a [[medical school]] listed by the Medical Board of California, which is more stringent than the [[International Medical Education Directory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fm.mednet.ucla.edu/IMG/residency/PTAL.asp University of California, Los Angeles - PTAL], Updated January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It also requires having a [[Social Security number]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbc.ca.gov/Applicants/Physicians_and_Surgeons/#8 The Medical Board of California - Physicians and Surgeons]. Retrieved May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning [[United States visa|visa]] requirements, non-U.S.-citizen doctors usually enter via the J1 or the H-1B visa. The J1 reqires a 2-year home residence after completion of training in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ama-assn.org/life-career/immigration-information-international-medical-graduates|title=Immigration Information for International Medical Graduates|publisher=American Medical Association|access-date=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The H-1B visa does not have this 2-year home residence requirement, but further requires the [[USMLE Step 3]]. And initially, a B-1 visitor visa is required for taking the USMLE Step 2 clinical skills examination and the USMLE Step 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seak.com/blog/uncategorized/10-biggest-immigration-mistakes-physicians-make/|title=The 10 Biggest Immigration Mistakes Physicians Make|website=www.seak.com|access-date=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality of care==
One study examining quality of care by international medical graduates is noted as follows.  "One-quarter of practicing physicians in the United States are graduates of international medical schools. The quality of care provided by doctors educated abroad has been the subject of ongoing concern. Our analysis of 244,153 hospitalizations in Pennsylvania found that patients of doctors who graduated from international medical schools and were not U.S. citizens at the time they entered medical school had significantly lower mortality rates than patients cared for by doctors who graduated from U.S. medical schools or who were U.S. citizens and received their degrees abroad. The patient population consisted of those with congestive heart failure or acute myocardial infarction. We found no significant mortality difference when comparing all international medical graduates with all U.S. medical school graduates".&lt;ref name=Norcini_1467&gt;{{Harvnb|Norcini|2010|pp=1467}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Data on older Medicare patients admitted to hospital in the US showed that patients treated by international graduates had lower mortality than patients cared for by US graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.j273 |title=Quality of care delivered by general internists in US hospitals who graduated from foreign versus US medical schools: observational study |publisher=BMJ |date=3 February 2017| doi=10.1136/bmj.j273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the type of [[gonad]]s—ovaries or testicles;
* the [[sex hormone]]s; 
* the internal reproductive anatomy (such as the [[uterus]] in females); and
* the external genitalia.

People whose characteristics are not either all typically male or all typically female at birth are intersex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isna.org/faq/what_is_intersex |title=What is intersex? |publisher=Intersex Society of North America |accessdate=18 November 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110143819/http://www.isna.org/faq/what_is_intersex |archivedate=10 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some intersex traits are not always visible at birth; some babies may be born with ambiguous genitals, while others may have ambiguous internal organs (testes and ovaries). Others will not become aware that they are intersex unless they receive genetic testing, because it does not manifest in their phenotype.

Whether or not they were socially tolerated or accepted by any particular culture, the existence of intersex people was known to many ancient and pre-modern cultures. The Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] wrote of "hermaphroditus" in the first century BCE that Hermaphroditus "is born with a physical body which is a combination of that of a man and that of a woman", and with supernatural properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harvard University Press| last = [[Diodorus Siculus]]| others = C H Oldfather (trans.)| title = Library of History (Book IV)| location = Cambridge, MA| series = Loeb Classical Library Volumes 303 and 340| date = 1935| url = http://www.theoi.com/Text/DiodorusSiculus4A.html#6| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080927074542/http://www.theoi.com/Text/DiodorusSiculus4A.html#6| archivedate = 27 September 2008| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In European societies, [[Roman law]], post-classical [[canon law]], and later [[common law]], referred to a person's sex as male, female or hermaphrodite, with legal rights as male or female depending on the characteristics that appeared most dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn E. Roller, "The Ideology of the Eunuch Priest," ''Gender &amp; History'' 9.3 (1997), p. 558.&lt;/ref&gt; The 12th-century ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'' states that "Whether an hermaphrodite may witness a testament, depends on which sex prevails".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'', C. 4, q. 2 et 3, c. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://geschichte.digitale-sammlungen.de/decretum-gratiani/kapitel/dc_chapter_1_1585 | title = Decretum Gratiani (Kirchenrechtssammlung) | work = Bayerische StaatsBibliothek ([[Bavarian State Library]]) | date = 5 February 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161220084841/http://geschichte.digitale-sammlungen.de/decretum-gratiani/kapitel/dc_chapter_1_1585 | archivedate = 20 December 2016 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raming"&gt;{{cite book | title = A History of Women and Ordination | last1 = Raming | first1 = Ida | last2 = Macy | first2 = Gary | last3 = Bernard J | first3 = Cook | publisher = [[Scarecrow Press]] | date = 2004 | page = 113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation of common law, the 17th Century ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'' described how a hermaphrodite could inherit "either as male or female, according to that kind of sexe which doth prevaile."&lt;ref&gt;E Coke, The First Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England, Institutes 8.a.

In some non-European societies, sex or gender systems with more than two categories may have allowed for other forms of inclusion of both intersex and [[transgender]] people. Such societies have been characterized as "primitive", while [[Morgan Holmes]] states that subsequent analysis has been simplistic or romanticized, failing to take account of the ways that subjects of all categories are treated.&lt;ref name="Holmes2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holmes |first=Morgan |author-link=Morgan Holmes |date=July 2004 |title=Locating Third Sexes |url=http://www.transformationsjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Holmes_Transformations08.pdf |journal=Transformations Journal |publisher= |volume= |issue=8 |pages= |issn=1444-3775 |accessdate=2014-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Victorian era]], medical authors introduced the terms "[[true hermaphrodite]]" for an individual who has both ovarian and testicular tissue, "male pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with testicular tissue, but either female or ambiguous sexual anatomy, and "female pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with ovarian tissue, but either male or ambiguous sexual anatomy. Some later shifts in terminology have reflected advances in genetics, while other shifts are suggested to be due to pejorative associations.&lt;ref name="cabral2014" /&gt;

The term ''intersexuality'' was coined by [[Richard Goldschmidt]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1210/endo-1-4-433 | last1 = Goldschmidt | first1 = R. | year = 1917 | title = Intersexuality and the endocrine aspect of sex  | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 433–456 | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first suggestion to replace the term 'hermaphrodite' with 'intersex' was made by [[Alexander Polycleitos Cawadias|Cawadias]] in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Cawadias, A.

Since the rise of modern medical science, some intersex people with ambiguous external genitalia have had their genitalia surgically modified to resemble either female or male genitals.

{{further|Intersex rights by country}}
Human rights institutions are placing increasing scrutiny on harmful practices and issues of discrimination against intersex people. These issues have been addressed by a rapidly increasing number of international institutions including, in 2015, the Council of Europe, the United Nations [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] and the [[World Health Organization]]. These developments have been accompanied by [[International Intersex Forum]]s and increased cooperation amongst civil society organizations. However, the implementation, codification, and enforcement of intersex human rights in national legal systems remains slow.

Areas of concern include non-consensual medical interventions; stigma, discrimination and equal treatment; access to reparations and justice; access to information and support, and legal recognition.

===The term "intersex"===

Some people with intersex traits self-identify as intersex, and some do not.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Preves, "Intersex and Identity, the Contested Self".

===Hermaphrodite===
{{Main|Hermaphrodite}}
A [[hermaphrodite]] is an organism that has both male and female reproductive organs. Until the mid-20th century, "hermaphrodite" was used synonymously with "intersex".&lt;ref name="Cawadias, A.

Currently, hermaphroditism is not to be confused with intersex, as the former refers only to a specific phenotypical presentation of sex organs and the latter to a more complex combination of phenotypical and genotypical presentation. Using ''hermaphrodite'' to refer to intersex individuals is considered to be stigmatizing and misleading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isna.org/faq/hermaphrodite |title=Is a person who is intersex a hermaphrodite? &amp;#124; Intersex Society of North America |publisher=Isna.org |accessdate=5 July 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701061246/http://www.isna.org/faq/hermaphrodite |archivedate=1 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hermaphrodite'' is used for animal and vegetal species in which the possession of both ovaries and testes is either serial or concurrent, and for living organisms without such gonads but present binary form of reproduction, which is part of the typical life history of those species; ''intersex'' has come to be used when this is not the case.

===Disorders of sex development===
{{Main|Disorders of sex development }}
"[[Disorders of sex development]]" (DSD) is a contested term,&lt;ref name=GDavis&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Georgiann|title=Contesting Intersex: The Dubious Diagnosis|date=11 September 2015|publisher=[[New York University Press]]|isbn=978-1479887040|pages=87–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="holmes2011" /&gt; defined to include congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical.

Retrieved 4 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Other intersex people, activists, supporters, and academics have contested the adoption of the terminology and its implied status as a "disorder", seeing this as offensive to intersex individuals who do not feel that there is something wrong with them, regard the DSD consensus paper as reinforcing the normativity of early surgical interventions, and criticizing the treatment protocols associated with the new taxonomy.&lt;ref name="feder2009"&gt;Feder, E. (2009) 'Imperatives of Normality: From "Intersex" to "Disorders of Sex Development".' A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies (GLQ), 15, 225–247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociological research in Australia, published in 2016, found that 3% of respondents used the term "disorders of sex development" or "DSD" to define their sex characteristics, while 21% use the term when accessing medical services. In contrast, 60% used the term "intersex" in some form to self-describe their sex characteristics.&lt;ref name="jones2016" /&gt; U.S. research by the [[Lurie Children's Hospital]], Chicago, and the AIS-DSD Support Group published in 2017 found that "disorders of sex development" terminology may negatively affect care, give offense, and result in lower attendance at medical clinics.&lt;ref name="lurie2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="johnson2017" /&gt;

{{main|Intersex Awareness Day|Intersex Day of Remembrance}}
[[Intersex Awareness Day]] is an internationally observed civil awareness day designed to highlight the challenges faced by intersex people, occurring annually on 26 October. It marks the first public demonstration by intersex people, which took place in Boston on 26 October 1996, outside a venue where the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] was holding its annual conference.&lt;ref name="holmesiad"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intersexday.org/en/max-beck-morgan-holmes-boston-1996/ |title=When Max Beck and Morgan Holmes went to Boston |last=Holmes |first=Morgan |author-link=Morgan Holmes |date=17 October 2015 |website=Intersex Day |publisher= |access-date=2015-10-24 |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020004238/http://intersexday.org/en/max-beck-morgan-holmes-boston-1996/ |archivedate=20 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intersex Day of Remembrance]], also known as Intersex Solidarity Day, is an internationally observed civil awareness day designed to highlight issues faced by intersex people, occurring annually on 8 November. It marks the birthday of [[Herculine Barbin]], a French intersex person whose memoirs were later published by [[Michel Foucault]] in ''[[Herculine Barbin: Being the Recently Discovered Memoirs of a Nineteenth-century French Hermaphrodite]].''

=== Flag ===
[[File:Intersex flag.svg|right|thumb|Intersex flag]]
{{main|Intersex flag}}
The intersex flag was created by [[Intersex Human Rights Australia]] (formerly OII Australia) in July 2013 to create a flag "that is not derivative, but is yet firmly grounded in meaning". The organization aimed to create a symbol without gendered pink and blue colors. It describes yellow and purple as "[[hermaphrodite]]" colors. The circle is described as "unbroken and unornamented, symbolising wholeness and completeness, and our potentialities. We are still fighting for bodily autonomy and genital integrity, and this symbolises the right to be who and how we want to be."&lt;ref&gt;[http://oii.org.au/22773/an-intersex-flag/ An intersex flag] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110094626/http://oii.org.au/22773/an-intersex-flag/ |date=10 November 2013 }}, [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]], 5 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{main|Intersex people and religion}}
In ''Hinduism'', [[Sangam literature]] uses the word ''pedi'' to refer to people born with an intersex condition; it also refers to ''antharlinga'' hijras and various other [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Maraikkappatta Pakkangal: மறைக்கப்பட்ட பக்கங்கள்|last=Winter |first=Gopi Shankar|year=2014 |publisher=Srishti Madurai |isbn=9781500380939 |oclc=703235508 |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warne and Raza argue that an association between intersex and hijra people is mostly unfounded but provokes parental fear.&lt;ref name="warne2008"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s11154-008-9084-2| pmid = 18633712| issn = 1389-9155| volume = 9| issue = 3| pages = 227–236| last1 = Warne| first1 = Garry L.| last2 = Raza| first2 = Jamal| title = Disorders of sex development (DSDs), their presentation and management in different cultures| journal = Reviews in Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders| accessdate = 22 March 2015| date = September 2008| url = https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11154-008-9084-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Islam'', scholars of Islamic jurisprudence have detailed discussions on the status and rights of intersex based on what mainly exhibits in their external sexual organs. Yet, modern Islamic jurisprudence scholars turn to medical screening to determine the dominance of their sex. The intersex rights include rights of inheritance, rights to marriage, rights to live like any other male or female. The rights are generally based on whether they are true hermaphrodites or pseudohermaphrodite. Scholars of Islamic jurisprudence generally consider their rights based on the majority of what appears from their external sexual organs.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In ''Judaism'', the [[Talmud]] contains extensive discussion concerning the status of two intersex types in Jewish law; namely the ''androgynous'', which exhibits both male and female external sexual organs, and the ''tumtum'' which exhibits neither. In the 1970s and 1980s, the treatment of intersex babies started to be discussed in Orthodox Jewish medical [[halacha]] by prominent rabbinic leaders, for example [[Eliezer Waldenberg]] and [[Moshe Feinstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/72653/the-space-between-stanford-prof-talmudic-rabbis-were-into-analyzing-sexuali/|title=the space between   -   Stanford prof: Talmudic rabbis were into analyzing sexuality  -  j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010140948/http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/72653/the-space-between-stanford-prof-talmudic-rabbis-were-into-analyzing-sexuali/|archivedate=10 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple athletes have been humiliated, excluded from competition or been forced to return medals following discovery of an intersex trait. Examples include [[Erik Schinegger]], [[Foekje Dillema]], [[Maria José Martínez-Patiño]] and [[Santhi Soundarajan]]. In contrast, [[Stanisława Walasiewicz]] (also known as Stella Walsh) was the subject of posthumous controversy.&lt;ref name="Snochowska-Gonzales"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Klaudia Snochowska-Gonzales| title =Walasiewicz była kobietą (Walasiewicz Was a Woman)|journal=[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]|volume=190|issue=14 August 2004|page=8|url=http://szukaj.gazeta.pl/archiwum/1,0,4144041.html?wyr=Walasiewicz%2B%2B%2B | accessdate = 31 May 2006 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Intersex rights in South Africa|South African]] middle-distance runner [[Caster Semenya]] won gold at the World Championships in the women's 800 meter and won silver in the 2012 Summer Olympics. When Semenya won gold in the World Championships, the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF) requested sex verification tests. The results were not released, but Semenya was cleared to race with other women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooky|first=Cheryl|author2=Shari L.

In April 2014, the [[BMJ]] reported that four elite women athletes with 5-ARD were subjected to sterilization and "partial clitoridectomies" in order to compete in sport.

There are few firm estimates of the number of intersex people. The now-defunct [[Intersex Society of North America]] stated that:

{{quotation|If you ask experts at medical centers how often a child is born so noticeably atypical in terms of genitalia that a specialist in sex differentiation is called in, the number comes out to about 1 in 1500 to 1 in 2000 births ''[0.07–0.05%]''. But a lot more people than that are born with subtler forms of sex anatomy variations, some of which won't show up until later in life.&lt;ref name="ISNA frequency"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency |title=How common is intersex? &amp;#124; Intersex Society of North America |publisher=Isna.org |accessdate=21 August 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822212522/http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency/ |archivedate=22 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Blackless, Fausto-Sterling et al., said in two articles in 2000 that 1.7 percent of human births (1 in 60) might be intersex, including variations that may not become apparent until, for example, puberty, or until attempting to conceive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1520-6300(200003/04)12:2&lt;151::AID-AJHB1&gt;3.0.CO;2-F| issn = 1520-6300| volume = 12| issue = 2| pages = 151–166| last1 = Blackless| first1 = Melanie| last2 = Charuvastra| first2 = Anthony| last3 = Derryck| first3 = Amanda| last4 = Fausto-Sterling| first4 = Anne| last5 = Lauzanne| first5 = Karl| last6 = Lee| first6 = Ellen| title = How sexually dimorphic are we?

Eric Vilain et al. highlighted in 2007 that the term [[disorders of sex development]] (DSD) had replaced "hermaphrodite" and improper medical terms based on it.&lt;ref name="vilain"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vilain E, Achermann JC, Eugster EA, Harley VR, Morel Y, Wilson JD, Hiort O | year = 2007 | title = We used to call them hermaphrodites | url = | journal = Genetics in Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 65–66 | doi=10.1097/gim.0b013e31802cffcf| pmid = 17304046 | last2 = Achermann | last3 = Eugster | last4 = Harley | last5 = Morel | last6 = Wilson | last7 = Hiort }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure of 1.7% is still maintained by Intersex Human Rights Australia "despite its flaws".&lt;ref&gt;https://ihra.org.au/16601/intersex-numbers/&lt;/ref&gt; "This estimate relates to any "individual who deviates from the Platonic ideal of physical dimorphism at the chromosomal, genital, gonadal, or hormonal levels" and thus it encapsulates the entire population of people who are stigmatised – or risk stigmatisation – due to innate sex characteristics."

Individuals with diagnoses of [[disorders of sex development]] (DSD) may or may not experience stigma and discrimination due to their sex characteristics, including sex "normalizing" interventions.  Human rights institutions have called for the demedicalisation of intersex traits, as far as possible.&lt;ref name="SenateOnSterilisation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fra" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iachr" /&gt;

In 2002 Leonard Sax argued that 'intersex' should be "restricted to those conditions in which chromosomal sex is inconsistent with phenotypic sex, or in which the phenotype is not classifiable as either male or female", around 0.018% (1 in 5600).&lt;ref name="Sax-9"&gt;{{cite journal| last =  Sax| first =  Leonard| authorlink = Leonard Sax| title = How common is intersex? a response to Anne Fausto-Sterling| journal = Journal of Sex Research| volume = 39| issue = 3| pages = 174–178| publisher = | year = 2002| doi = 10.1080/00224490209552139|id=| pmid = 12476264 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition excludes [[Klinefelter syndrome]] and many other variations, including those currently regarded as [[disorders of sex development]] (DSD).

In the [[Dominican Republic]], [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency]] is not uncommon in the town of [[Las Salinas]] resulting in social acceptance of the intersex trait.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mosley|first1=Michael|title=The extraordinary case of the Guevedoces|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34290981|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=23 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923000145/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34290981|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men with the trait are called "güevedoces" (Spanish for "eggs at twelve"). 12 out of 13 families had one or more male family members that carried the gene.

==Medical classifications==

===Signs===

====Ambiguous genitalia====

Ambiguous genitalia may appear as a large clitoris or as a small penis.
[[File:Quigley scale for androgen insensitivity syndrome.jpg|thumb|The [[Quigley scale]] is a method for describing genital development in AIS.]]
Because there is variation in all of the processes of the [[Sex organ#Development|development of the sex organs]], a child can be born with a [[sexual anatomy]] that is typically female or feminine in appearance with a larger-than-average [[clitoris]] ([[clitoral hypertrophy]]) or typically male or masculine in appearance with a smaller-than-average [[penis]] that is open along the underside. The appearance may be quite ambiguous, describable as female genitals with a very large clitoris and partially fused labia, or as male genitals with a very small penis, completely open along the midline ("[[hypospadic]]"), and empty scrotum. Fertility is variable.

==== Measurement systems ====
The [[orchidometer]] is a medical instrument to measure the volume of the testicles. It was developed by Swiss pediatric endocrinologist [[Andrea Prader]]. The [[Prader scale]]&lt;ref name=MDPRAD&gt;{{Cite news| last1 =  Diamond| first1 =  Milton| last2 =  Linda| first2 =  Watson| authorlink1 =  Milton Diamond| title =  Androgen insensitivity syndrome and Klinefelter's syndrome: sex and gender considerations| periodical =  Child Adolesc Psychiatric Clin N Am| year =  2004| issue =  13| pages =  623–640| url =  http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2000to2004/2004-ais-and-klinefelters.html| deadurl =  no| archiveurl =  https://web.archive.org/web/20130701141723/http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2000to2004/2004-ais-and-klinefelters.html| archivedate =  1 July 2013| df =  dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Quigley scale]] are visual rating systems that measure genital appearance.

==== Other signs ====

In order to help in classification, methods other than a genitalia inspection can be performed. For instance, a [[karyotype]] display of a tissue sample may determine which of the causes of intersex is prevalent in the case.

===Causes===

{{Main|Sexual differentiation}}
The common pathway of [[sexual differentiation]], where a productive human female has an XX chromosome pair, and a productive male has an XY pair, is relevant to the development of intersex conditions.

During fertilization, the sperm adds either an X (female) or a Y (male) chromosome to the X in the ovum. This determines the genetic sex of the embryo.&lt;ref name="Kolodny"/&gt; During the first weeks of development, genetic male and female fetuses are "anatomically indistinguishable", with primitive gonads beginning to develop during approximately the sixth week of gestation. The gonads, in a "bipotential state", may develop into either testes (the male gonads) or ovaries (the female gonads), depending on the consequent events.&lt;ref name="Kolodny"/&gt; Through the seventh week, genetically female and genetically male fetuses appear identical.

At around eight weeks of gestation, the gonads of an XY embryo differentiate into functional testes, secreting testosterone. Ovarian differentiation, for XX embryos, does not occur until approximately week 12 of gestation. In normal female differentiation, the [[Müllerian duct|Müllerian duct system]] develops into the [[uterus]], [[Fallopian tubes]], and inner third of the vagina.
In males, the Müllerian duct-inhibiting hormone [[Anti-Müllerian hormone|MIH]] causes this duct system to regress. Next, androgens cause the development of the [[Wolffian duct|Wolffian duct system]], which develops into the [[vas deferens]], seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts.&lt;ref name="Kolodny"&gt;{{Cite book| last =  Kolodny| first =  Robert C.| author-link = | last2 =  Masters| first2 =  William H.|author2-link = William Masters| last3 =  Johnson| first3 =  Virginia E.|author3-link = Virginia E. Johnson| title = Textbook of Sexual Medicine |place =| publisher = Little, Brown and Company| year = 1979| location = Boston| volume = |edition = 1st |doi =| id = |isbn = 0-316-50154-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By birth, the typical fetus has been completely "sexed" male or female, meaning that the genetic sex (XY-male or XX-female) corresponds with the phenotypical sex; that is to say, genetic sex corresponds with internal and external gonads, and external appearance of the genitals.

=== Conditions ===
{{further|disorders of sex development}}
There are a variety of opinions on what conditions or traits are and are not intersex, dependent on the definition of intersex that is used. Current human rights based definitions stress a broad diversity of sex characteristics that differ from expectations for male or female bodies.&lt;ref name="unfe-fact" /&gt; During 2015, the [[Council of Europe]],&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt; the [[Fundamental Rights Agency|European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights]]&lt;ref name="fra" /&gt; and [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]]&lt;ref name="iachr" /&gt; have called for a review of medical classifications on the basis that they presently [[Intersex human rights|impede enjoyment of the right to health]]; the Council of Europe expressed concern that "the gap between the expectations of human rights organisations of intersex people and the development of medical classifications has possibly widened over the past decade".&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fra"&gt;{{Citation| last = European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights| title = The fundamental rights situation of intersex people| date = April 2015| url = http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2015-focus-04-intersex.pdf| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305072423/http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2015-focus-04-intersex.pdf| archivedate = 5 March 2016| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iachr"&gt;{{Citation| publisher = Comisión Interamericana de Derechos Humanos| last = Comisión Interamericana de Derechos Humanos| title = Violencia contra Personas Lesbianas, Gays, Bisexuales, Trans e Intersex en América| date = 12 November 2015| url = http://www.oas.org/es/cidh/informes/pdfs/ViolenciaPersonasLGBTI.pdf| language = Spanish| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160107143635/http://www.oas.org/es/cidh/informes/pdfs/ViolenciaPersonasLGBTI.pdf| archivedate = 7 January 2016| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |-
 | XX || [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH) || The most common cause of sexual ambiguity is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), an endocrine disorder in which the [[adrenal gland]]s produce abnormally high levels of virilizing hormones in utero. The genes that cause CAH can now be detected in the developing embryo. As Fausto-Sterling mentioned in chapter 3 of ''Sexing the Body'', "a woman who suspects she may be pregnant with a CAH baby (if she or someone in her family carries CAH) can undergo treatment and then get tested." To prevent an XX-CAH child's genitalia from becoming masculinized, a treatment, which includes the use of the steroid dexamethasone, must begin as early as four weeks after formation. Many do not favor this process because "the safety of this experimental therapy has not been established in rigorously controlled trials", it does allow physicians to detect abnormalities, therefore starting treatment right after birth. Starting treatment as soon as an XX-CAH baby is born not only minimizes but also may even eliminate the chances of genital surgery from being performed.&lt;ref name="Anne_Fausto-Sterling_2000" /&gt; However, the necessity of such surgery itself is disputed.

Meta-analysis of the studies supporting the use of dexamethasone on CAH at-risk fetuses found "less than one half of one percent of published 'studies' of this intervention were regarded as being of high enough quality to provide meaningful data for a meta-analysis. Even these four studies were of low quality" ... "in ways so slipshod as to breach professional standards of medical ethics"&lt;ref name="pmid22904609"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dreger|first=Alice|author2=Ellen K. Feder |author3=Anne Tamar-Mattis |title=Prenatal Dexamethasone for Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia|journal=Journal of Bioethical Inquiry|volume=9|issue=3|pages=277–294|date=30 July 2012|doi=10.1007/s11673-012-9384-9|pmid=22904609|pmc=3416978}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "there were no data on long-term follow-up of physical and metabolic outcomes in children exposed to dexamethasone".&lt;ref name="pmid20550539"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fernández-Balsells|first=M.M.|author2=K.

In XX-females, this can range from partial masculinization that produces a large clitoris, to virilization and male appearance. The latter applies in particular to [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency]], which is the most common form of CAH.

Individuals born with XX chromosomes affected by [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency|17α-hydroxylase deficiency]] are born with female internal and external anatomy, but, at puberty, neither the adrenals nor the ovaries can produce sex-hormones, inhibiting breast development and the growth of pubic hair.

See below for XY CAH 17α-hydroxylase deficiency.
 |-
 | XX || [[Progestin-induced virilisation]] || In this case, the excess androgen hormones are caused by the use of [[progestin]], a drug that was used in the 1950s and 1960s to prevent miscarriage. These individuals normally have internal and external female anatomy, with functional ovaries and will therefore have menstruation. They develop, however, some male secondary sex characteristics and they frequently have unusually large clitorises. In very advanced cases, such children have initially been identified as males.{{mcn|date=April 2018}}
 |-
 | XX || [[Freemartin]]ism || This condition occurs commonly in all species of [[Bovinae|cattle]] and affects most females born as a twin to a male. It is rare or unknown in other mammals, including humans. In cattle, the [[placenta]]e of [[fraternal twins]] usually fuse at some time during the pregnancy, and the twins then share their blood supply. If the twins are of different sexes, male hormones produced in the body of the fetal bull find their way into the body of the fetal heifer (female), and masculinize her. Her sexual organs do not develop fully, and her ovaries may even contain testicular tissue. When adult, such a ''freemartin'' is very like a normal female in external appearance, but she is infertile, and behaves more like a [[Castration|castrated]] male (a steer). The male twin is not significantly affected, although (if he remains entire) his testes may be slightly reduced in size. The degree of masculinization of the freemartin depends on the stage of pregnancy at which the placental fusion occurs{{spaced ndash}}in about ten percent of such births no fusion occurs and both calves develop normally as in other mammals.
 |-
 | XY || [[Androgen insensitivity syndrome]] (AIS) || People with AIS have a Y chromosome, (typically XY), but are unable to metabolize androgens in varying degrees.

Cases with typically female appearance and genitalia are said to have complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS). People with CAIS have a [[vagina]] and no [[uterus]], [[cervix]], or [[ovaries]], and are infertile. The vagina may be shorter than usual, and, in some cases, is nearly absent. Instead of female internal reproductive organs, a person with CAIS has undescended or partially descended testes, of which the person may not even be aware.

In mild and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS and PAIS), the body is partially receptive to androgens, so there is virilization to varying degrees. PAIS can result in genital ambiguity, due to limited metabolization of the androgens produced by the testes. Ambiguous genitalia may present as a large clitoris, known as [[clitoromegaly]], or a small penis, which is called [[micropenis]] or microphallus; hypospadias and [[cryptorchidism]] may also be present, with one or both testes undescended, and hypospadias appearing just below the glans on an otherwise typical male penis, or at the base of the shaft, or at the perineum and including a bifid (or cleft) scrotum.
 |-
 | XY || [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency]] (5-ARD) || The condition affects individuals with a [[Y chromosome]], making their bodies unable to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is necessary for the development of male genitalia in utero, and plays no role in female development, so its absence tends to result in ambiguous genitalia at birth; the effects can range from infertility with male genitalia to male underdevelopment with hypospadias to female genitalia with mild clitoromegaly. The frequency is unknown, and children are sometimes misdiagnosed as having AIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic1980.htm |title=eMedicine article on 5-ARD |publisher=Emedicine.com |date=23 June 2009 |accessdate=21 August 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017193051/http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic1980.htm |archivedate=17 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals can have testes, as well as vagina and labia, and a small penis capable of ejaculation that looks like a clitoris at birth. Such individuals are usually raised as girls. The lack of DHT also limits the development of facial hair.
 |-
 | XY || [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH) || In individuals with a Y chromosome (typically XY) who have [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency]], CAH inhibits virilization, unlike cases without a Y chromosome.
 |-
 | XY || [[Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome]] (PMDS) || The child has XY chromosomes typical of a male. The child has a male body and an internal uterus and fallopian tubes because his body did not produce [[Müllerian inhibiting factor]] during fetal development.
 |-
 | XY || [[Anorchia]] || Individuals with XY chromosomes whose gonads were lost after 14 weeks of fetal development. People with anorchia have no ability to produce the hormones responsible for developing male secondary sex characteristics nor the means to produce [[gamete]]s necessary for reproduction due to the lack of gonads. They may develop typically feminine secondary sex characteristics without or despite the administration of androgens to artificially initiate physical sex differentiation (typically planned around the age of puberty). Psychological and neurological gender identity may solidify before the administration of androgens, leading to [[gender dysphoria]], as anorchic individuals are typically [[sex assignment|assigned male at birth]].
 |-
|XY||Gonadal dysgenesis|| It has various causes and are not all genetic; a catch-all category. &lt;br /&gt; It refers to individuals (mostly XY) whose gonads don't develop properly. Clinical features are heterogeneous.&lt;ref name="Anne_Fausto-Sterling_2000" /&gt;
|-
|XY||[[Hypospadias]]|| It is caused by various causes, including alterations in testosterone metabolism.&lt;br /&gt;	The urethra does not run to the tip of the penis. In mild forms, the opening is just shy of the tip; in moderate forms, it is along the shaft; and in severe forms, it may open at the base of the penis.&lt;ref name="Anne Fausto-Sterling 2000"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality]]|year=2000|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|location=New York|author=Anne Fausto-Sterling|authorlink=Anne Fausto-Sterling}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
 | Other || Unusual chromosomal sex || In addition to the most common XX and XY chromosomal sexes, there are several other possible combinations, for example [[Turner syndrome]] ([[Turner syndrome|XO]]), [[Triple X syndrome]] (XXX), [[Klinefelter syndrome]] (XXY) and variants ([[XXYY syndrome|XXYY]], [[XXXY syndrome|XXXY]], [[49, XXXXY syndrome|XXXXY]]), [[XYY syndrome]], de la Chapelle syndrome ([[XX male syndrome|XX male]]), [[Swyer syndrome]] (XY female).
 |-
 | Other || [[Mosaicism]] and [[chimerism]] || A mix can occur, where some of the cells of the body have the common XX or XY, while some have one of the less usual chromosomal contents above. Such a mixture is caused by either [[mosaicism]] or [[chimerism]]. In mosaicism, the mixture is caused by a mutation in one of the cells of the embryo after fertilization, whereas chimerism is a fusion of two embryos.

In alternative fashion, it is simply a mixture between XX and XY, and does not have to involve any less-common genotypes in individual cells. This, too, can occur both as chimerism and as a result of one sex chromosome having mutated into the other.&lt;ref name="pmid991437"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=De Marchi M, Carbonara AO, Carozzi F |title=True hermaphroditism with XX/XY sex chromosome mosaicism: report of a case |journal=Clin.

Mosaicism and chimerism may involve chromosomes other than the sex chromosomes, and not result in intersex traits.
|-
| Other || [[True hermaphroditism|Ovotesticular disorder (also known as true hermaphroditism)]]  || A "true hermaphrodite" is defined as someone with both testicular and ovarian tissue. There is a spectrum of forms of ovotesticular disorder. The varieties include having two [[ovotestis|ovotestes]], or one ovary and one ovotestis. Phenotype is not determinable from the ovotestes; in some cases, the appearance is "fairly typically female"; in others, it is "fairly typically male", and it may also be "fairly in-between in terms of genital development."&lt;ref name="titleovo-testes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isna.org/faq/conditions/ovo-testes |title=ovo-testes (formerly called "true hermaphroditism") |work=Intersex Society of North America |accessdate=9 December 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104161607/http://www.isna.org/faq/conditions/ovo-testes |archivedate=4 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intersex activist [[Cheryl Chase (activist)|Cheryl Chase]] is an example of someone with ovotestes.&lt;ref name="weil"&gt;Weil, Elizabeth (September 2006).

===Rationales===

Medical interventions take place to address physical health concerns and psychosocial risks. Both types of rationale are the subject of debate, particularly as the consequences of surgical (and many hormonal) interventions are lifelong and irreversible. Questions regarding physical health include accurately assessing risk levels, necessity, and timing. Psychosocial rationales are particularly susceptible to questions of necessity as they reflect social and cultural concerns.

There remains no clinical consensus about an evidence base, surgical timing, necessity, type of surgical intervention, and degree of difference warranting intervention.&lt;ref name="2016dsd"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1159/000442975| issn = 1663-2818| volume = 85| issue = 3| last1 = Lee| first1 = Peter A.| last2 = Nordenström| first2 = Anna| last3 = Houk| first3 = Christopher P.| last4 = Ahmed| first4 = S.

===Types===

* '''Feminizing and masculinizing surgeries''': Surgical procedures depend on diagnosis, and there is often concern as to whether surgery should be performed at all. Typically, surgery is performed shortly after birth. Defenders of the practice argue that it is necessary for individuals to be clearly identified as male or female in order for them to function socially and develop normally. Psychosocial reasons are often stated.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; This is criticised by many human rights institutions, and authors. Unlike other aesthetic surgical procedures performed on infants, such as corrective surgery for a [[cleft lip]], genital surgery may lead to negative consequences for sexual functioning in later life, or feelings of freakishness and unacceptability.&lt;ref name="ISNA4"&gt;Intersex Society of North America (24 May 2006). [http://www.isna.org/faq/healthy What evidence is there that you can grow up psychologically healthy with intersex genitals (without "normalizing" surgeries)?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208214540/http://www.isna.org/faq/healthy |date=8 December 2006 }}. Retrieved 25 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Genetic diagnosis of intersex|Hormone treatment]]''': There is widespread evidence of prenatal testing and hormone treatment to prevent or eliminate intersex traits,&lt;ref name="dftm"&gt;[http://www.thehastingscenter.org/Bioethicsforum/Post.aspx?id=4754 Bioethics Forum blog – Preventing Homosexuality (and Uppity Women) in the Womb?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402051942/http://www.thehastingscenter.org/Bioethicsforum/Post.aspx?id=4754 |date=2 April 2016 }}, [[Alice Dreger]], Ellen K.

Meyer-Bahlburg (1999), in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism, Volume 84 Issue 6 | 1 June 1999, retrieved 18 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; associated also with the problematization of sexual orientation and gender non-conformity.&lt;ref name="dftm" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer-Bahlburg |first= HFL |authorlink=Heino Meyer-Bahlburg |date = 1990 |title= Will prenatal hormone treatment prevent homosexuality?|journal=Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology|volume=1|number=4|pages = 279–283. |doi=10.1089/cap.1990.1.279}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Psychosocial support''': All stakeholders support psychosocial support. A joint international statement by participants at the Third [[International Intersex Forum]] in 2013 sought, amongst other demands: "Recognition that medicalization and stigmatisation of intersex people result in significant trauma and mental health concerns. In view of ensuring the bodily integrity and well-being of intersex people, autonomous non-pathologising psycho-social and peer support be available to intersex people throughout their life (as self-required), as well as to parents and/or care providers."
* '''[[Genetic diagnosis of intersex|Genetic selection and terminations]]''': The ethics of [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] to select against intersex traits was the subject of 11 papers in the October 2013 issue of the ''[[American Journal of Bioethics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioethics.net/journals/ajob-volume-13-number-10/|title=American Journal of Bioethics, 13:10, 51-53.

Behrmann and Ravitsky find social concepts of sex, gender and sexual orientation to be "intertwined on many levels. Parental choice against intersex may thus conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity."&lt;ref name="Behrmann2013" /&gt;
* '''[[Gender dysphoria]]''': The [[DSM-5]] included a change from using gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria. This revised code now specifically includes intersex people who do not identify with their sex assigned at birth and experience clinically significant distress or impairment, using the language of [[disorders of sex development]].&lt;ref name="kraus2015"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s10508-015-0550-0| pmid = 25944182| issn = 0004-0002| last = Kraus| first = Cynthia| title = Classifying Intersex in DSM-5: Critical Reflections on Gender Dysphoria| journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior| accessdate = 19 July 2015| date = May 2015| url = https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10508-015-0550-0| volume=44| issue = 5| pages=1147–1163}}&lt;/ref&gt; This move was criticised by intersex advocacy groups in Australia and [[Intersex rights in New Zealand|New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="OIIA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oii.org.au/20360/submission-release-on-the-dsm-5-and-soc-7/|title=OII Australia and OII Aotearoa submission on the DSM-5 and SOC-7|work=[[Organisation Intersex International Australia]]|accessdate=6 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006091617/http://oii.org.au/20360/submission-release-on-the-dsm-5-and-soc-7/|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Medical photography and display''': Photographs of intersex children's genitalia are circulated in medical communities for documentary purposes. Problems associated with medical photography of intersex children have been discussed due to experiences of humiliation and powerlessness by child subjects,&lt;ref name=PREV&gt;{{Cite book| last =  Preves| first =  Sharon| title = Intersex and Identity, the Contested Self| year = 2003| publisher = Rutgers| isbn = 0-8135-3229-9}} p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; along with their ethics, control and usage.&lt;ref name=CRPH&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 =  Creighton| first1 =  Sarah| last2 =  Alderson| first2 =  J| last3 =  Brown| first3 =  S| last4 =  Minto| first4 =  Cathy| year =  2002| title =  Medical photography: ethics, consent and the intersex patient| periodical =  BJU International| volume =  89| pages =  67–71| url =  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1464-410X.2002.02558.x/pdf| doi =  10.1046/j.1464-410X.2002.02558.x| deadurl =  no| archiveurl =  https://web.archive.org/web/20161005195343/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1464-410X.2002.02558.x/pdf| archivedate =  5 October 2016| df =  dmy-all}} p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, an '''Islamic garden''' is a cool place of rest and reflection, and a reminder of [[Jannah|paradise]].  The [[Qur'an]] has many references to gardens, and the garden is used as an earthly analogue for the life in paradise which is promised to believers:

:''Allah has promised to the believing men and the believing women gardens, beneath which rivers flow, to abide in them, and goodly dwellings in gardens of perpetual abode; and best of all is Allah's goodly pleasure; that is the grand achievement'' (Qur'an 9.72)

There are surviving formal Islamic gardens in a wide zone extending from Spain and Morocco in the west to India in the east. Famous Islamic gardens include those of the [[Taj Mahal]] in India and the [[Generalife]] and [[Alhambra]] in Spain.

The general theme of a traditional Islamic garden is water and shade, not surprisingly since Islam came from and generally spread in a hot and arid climate.  Unlike English gardens, which are often designed for walking, Islamic gardens are intended for rest and contemplation.  For this reason, Islamic gardens usually include places for sitting.

==Types==
[[D. Fairchild Ruggles|Fairchild Ruggles]] refers to the universal nature of gardening, and the basic human needs it fulfills; the needs to cultivate, to master the wild landscape, and to bring order to it.  The spiritual aspects of gardening, according to this view, were a later development.  She further points out the classic formal garden, known as the [[Charbagh]] (or Chahar Bagh), is but one form which exists in the Islamic civilization; a civilization which has traditionally included peoples of many faiths and cultures.&lt;ref name="Ruggles, D. Fairchild 2008"&gt;[[D. Fairchild Ruggles|Ruggles, D. Fairchild]]. ''Islamic Gardens and Landscapes''. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008, Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clifford A. Wright, an author on Mediterranean cuisine, describes different garden types for different purposes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/food/entries/display.php/topic_id/29/id/53/|title=Did You Know: Food History - The Muslim Gardens of Paradise|website=www.cliffordawright.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Muslims had different kinds of gardens serving different purposes. The bustan was the garden of the inner court of a house, a formal garden with pools and water channels. The jannah was an orchard with palms, oranges, and vines irrigated by canals. The rawdah referred in particular to the vegetable garden that produced foods for the cooks.}}

==Persian, Arabic and Byzantine influence==
After the Arab invasions of the 7th century CE, the traditional design of the [[Persian garden]] was used in the Islamic garden. [[Persian gardens]] after that time were traditionally enclosed by walls and were designed to represent [[Jannah|paradise]]; the Persian word for enclosed space is 'pairi-daeza.'   In the [[Charbagh]], or [[paradise garden]], four water canals typically carry water into a central pool or fountain, interpreted as the four rivers in paradise, filled with milk, honey, wine and water.&lt;ref name="Gardens of Islam"&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamic Arts|url=http://islamispeace.org.uk/itm.php?id_top=27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014025728/http://islamispeace.org.uk/itm.php?id_top=27|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 October 2007|website=Islamispeace.org.uk|publisher=Islamispeace.org.uk|accessdate=2 February 2018|date=14 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yves-Marie Allain and Janine Christiany, ''L'Art des jardins en Europe,'' Citadelles &amp; Mazenod, Paris, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hellenistic]] influences are also apparent; the Western use of straight lines in the plan is blended with [[Sassanid]] ornamental plantations and fountains.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marie-Luise Gothein]], ''A History of Garden Art'', Diederichs, 1914, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surviving gardens==
Many of the gardens of Islamic civilization are lost to us today. While most others may retain their forms, the original plantings have been replaced with modern ones.&lt;ref name="Ruggles, D. Fairchild 2008"/&gt; The garden is a transient form of architectural art dependent upon the climate, and the resources available to those who care for it.

===Albania===
[[Evliya Çelebi]]'s 17th century CE [[Seyahatname]] (travel book) contains descriptions of Paradise Gardens around the towns of Berat and Elbasan, Albania. According to Dr. [[Robert Elsie]], an expert on Albanian culture, very few traces of the refined oriental culture of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era remain here today.&lt;ref name="Elsie"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elsie|first1=Robert|title=Texts and Documents of Albanian History|url=http://www.albanianhistory.net/texts16-18/AH1670_1.html|website=Albanian History|accessdate=3 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705153855/http://www.albanianhistory.net/texts16-18/AH1670_1.html|archivedate=5 July 2011|quote=Extract from: Robert Dankoff and Robert Elsie (ed.): Evliya Çelebi in Albania and Adjacent Regions (Kosovo, Montenegro, Ohrid), Leiden 2000, p. 101 127, 161 193.

Elsie: Early Albania, a Reader of Historical Texts, 11th - 17th Centuries, Wiesbaden 2003, p. 195-218.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Çelebi describes the town of Berat:

{{quote|It is a huge open town, entirely outside the walls of the fortress. It is situated in a large area along the bank of the [...] river to the east and south of the upper fortress and is covered in vineyards, rose gardens and vegetable gardens. There are 5,000 one- and two-story stonework houses with red-tiled roofs. They are well built and attractive houses with gardens and are spread over seven verdant hills and valleys. Among them are over 100 splendid mansions with cisterns and fountains and an invigorating climate.&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt;}}

Çelebi describes the town of Elbasan:

{{quote|The open town outside the walls extends on all sides of the fortress to the foot of the hills at a distance of one hour's march. The prosperous and cheerful-looking mansions in the open town are adorned with beautiful vineyards, paradisiacal gardens and parks with their pavilions and galleries. They are two or three stories high, made of stonework and with tiled roofs. Each of them has a source of pure flowing water, a pool and a fountain with water spurting from jets. They are luxurious dwellings like those in the gardens of paradise.&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt;}}

===Algeria===
Dar al-Bahr, the Lake Palace, is situated on the southern end of [[Beni Hammad Fort]], a ruined fortified city which has remained uninhabited for 800 years.  Artifacts recovered from the site attest to a high degree of civilization. During its time, it was remarked upon by visitors for the nautical spectacles enacted in its large pool.  Surrounding the pool and the palace were terraces, courtyards and gardens.  Little is known of the details of these gardens, other than the lion motifs carved in their stone fountains.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, D. Fairchild. ''Islamic Gardens and Landscapes''. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Beni Hammad Fort is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], noted as an "authentic picture of a fortified Muslim city."

===The Shalimar gardens===
The name Shalimar is thought to mean, among other things, "abode of bliss" or "light of the moon". There were originally three gardens with the name Shalimar: [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|one in Lahore, Pakistan]], [[Shalimar Bagh (Srinagar)|another in Jammu Kashmir]], India and finally one, located in Delhi, which has completely disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Sikander, Sattar. ''The Shalamar: A Typical Muslim Garden''. Environmental Design: Journal of the Islamic Environmental Design Research Centre 2, 1986, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shalimar Gardens, Lahore====
[[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens, Lahore]], was built by the governor of Lahore, with funds supplied by the [[Mughal empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Jahan]], beginning in 1641 CE.  The water is supplied by a canal dug from the nearby Ravi river.  Built in the [[Mughal gardens|Mughal style]], it is surrounded by high walls with towers in the corners.  The inner face of the walls have traces of frescoes done in floral patterns.  The canal passes through the gardens, which are constructed on three separate terraces at different elevations.  The garden terraces are laid out in the traditional "paradise" motif of four channels converging on a central fountain, and cover a total of forty acres.&lt;ref&gt;Sikander, Sattar. ''The Shalamar: A Typical Muslim Garden''. Environmental Design: Journal of the Islamic Environmental Design Research Centre 2, 1986, pp. 24–29.&lt;/ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20060214214014/http://archnet.org/library/pubdownloader/pdf/4883/doc/DPC0715.pdf]

===Andalusian Spain===
The garden was a common feature of homes in Arab Spain.  Andalusian designs emphasized privacy and coolness, with rooms opening onto a roofed, open corridor.  Next to this corridor, one would typically find a verdant patio garden complete with central fountain.&lt;ref&gt;Irving, T. B. ''The Falcon of Spain ''. Ashraf Press, 1962, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Azhar park, Cairo===
[[Al-Azhar Park]] is a modern landmark in Cairo, Egypt. It is laid out along a central series of terraced, formal Islamic gardens.  Multicolored [[Mamluk]] stonework, fountains and [[Islamic geometric patterns]] are the predominating stylistic theme of the park.  It is listed as one of the world's sixty great public spaces by the [[Project for Public Spaces]] ([http://www.pps.org/ PPS]).&lt;ref name="PPS Sixty"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pps.org/info/gps/60places?referrer=gps_home |title=60 of the World's Great Places - Project for Public Spaces |accessdate=2006-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206002657/http://www.pps.org/info/gps/60places?referrer=gps_home |archivedate=2006-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Learning society''' is an educational philosophy advocated by the [[OECD]]&lt;ref&gt;OECD. (2000). “Knowledge Management in the Learning Society”. Paris: OECD Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[UNESCO]] that positions education as the key to a nation’s economic development, and holds that education should extend beyond [[formal learning]] (based in traditional educational institutions – schools, universities etc.) into [[informal learning]] centres to support a [[knowledge economy]] (known as a “world education culture”).&lt;ref name="Spring, J. 2009"&gt;Spring, J. (2009). “Globalization of Education: An Introduction”. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

A learning society regards the actual process of learning as an ‘activity, not a place’&lt;ref name="cisco.com"&gt;Cisco Systems Inc. (2010). “The Learning Society”. Retrieved September 14, 2010, from Cisco Systems Inc.: http://www.cisco.com/web/about/citizenship/socio-economic/docs/LearningSociety_WhitePaper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; – that is, it takes place outside of regular educational institutions, and is thus also decentralised and deregulated, a tenet of globalisation theory.

Learning societies are broader in context, drawing on elements of systems to facilitate the ability for [[lifelong learning]] in the individual. If lifelong learning is about the ability of the individual, then this is enabled through a Learning Society.

It is the ‘socialisation’ &lt;ref name="learndev.org"&gt;McClellan, J. (n.d.). “Envisioning Learning Societies Across Multiple Dimensions.” Retrieved September 13, 2010, from Learning Development Institute: http://www.learndev.org/dl/VS3-00g-LearnSocMultDim.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; of individual lifelong learning, and is currently aided through technologies and the increasing focus on social networking, by using the shared learning experiences of individuals as a basis for a larger network of education that exists formally and informally (schools, universities, job-training, support, collaboration, feedback etc.).

== History and theoretical framework ==
The history of the concept of the learning society can be traced through the chronological development of its theoretical framework. As the framework has developed overtime, so has the sophistication of the idea of the learning society as it applies to an inter-connected 21st-century model, particularly in relation to the shift from state-based educational institutions to more decentralised organisations.

In 1973, [[Donald Schön]]&lt;ref&gt;Schön, D. A. (1973). “Beyond the Stable State. Public and private learning in a changing society.” Harmondsworth: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; developed the idea that change is constant in a modern state (‘loss of the stable state’) and thus to adapt to this change, there must be a constant state of learning within the society of that state.
Further, [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]]&lt;ref&gt;Hutchins, R. M. (1970). “The Learning Society”. Harmondsworth: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; also argued that given the ever-changing nature of states, particularly in business organisations, it wasn’t possible for educational institutions to keep up, or even be expected to. 
Later, Torsten Husén&lt;ref&gt;Husén, T. (1986). “The Learning Society Revisited.” Oxford: Pergamon.&lt;/ref&gt; and Stewart Ranson&lt;ref&gt;Ranson, S. (1998). “Inside the Learning Society.” London: Cassell.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasise that learning has a certain ‘fluidity’ (with no start or end points) that exists outside of formal systems and this seems to reflect a liberalised market model of free movements of knowledge as required by organisations and systems.&lt;ref name="Spring, J. 2009"/&gt;

Developing this framework to a more contemporary basis, it is seen that the requirement for a ‘learning society’ is a response to the broader issues of globalisation whereby richer countries have then become increasingly dependent on “knowledge workers” rather than traditional manufacturing industries (now often outsourced to developing nations), and thus need their workforces to become adaptable, particularly in light of new technological developments which are seen as central to the knowledge economy.&lt;ref name="Jarvis, P. 2000"&gt;Jarvis, P. (2000). “Globalisation, the learning society and comparative education.” Comparative Education , 36 (3), 343-355.&lt;/ref&gt;
With this model the concept of the learning society will be transplanted to other countries globally, much like any other product on a global market. This is in keeping with the philosophy of the World Bank that learning and education is central to improved development, justice, the environment and eradication of poverty (and thus global terror threats).&lt;ref name="learndev.org"/&gt;

== Relationship to lifelong learning ==
A learning society is generally considered to be the basis from which lifelong learning can take place.
From a theoretical standpoint, not only does the learning society provide the framework in which lifelong learning is allowed to flourish, but that in fact both elements mutually support each other. That is, a learning society gives rise to the capacity for lifelong learning, but lifelong learning allows, through socialisation, for individuals to contribute back to the learning abilities of broader society in the form of wisdom (known as a ‘koinosophic’ or ‘wise’ society).&lt;ref name="learndev.org"/&gt;

== Elements of learning societies ==
While the notion of the learning society can be sometimes difficult to grasp (relying as it does on concepts such as ‘fluidity’ and ‘informality’, and moving outside of traditional educative boundaries such as schools &amp; universities), some scholars believe that a learning society can be identified as having 4 main attributes.&lt;ref name="Jarvis, P. 2000"/&gt; These are:

=== Futuristic ===
This is described as the tendency of the learning society to have a dependency on technological advances. This can be regarded as the shifts towards knowledge economies in developed countries where the concept of the learning society is most prevalent, but also vitally as acknowledging the importance of the internet in allowing education to move beyond traditional boundaries and move across transnational borders instantly.&lt;ref name="Jarvis, P. 2000"/&gt;

=== Societal ===
This attribute is part of the broader conscious acknowledgement that is made by states and institutions that lifelong learning (as part of the learning society) exists specifically to contribute to the economic growth of a country and increase the democratic engagement of its citizens. Rather than being a general global shift towards an educational trend, it is aims towards specific outcomes that societies consider to be for their betterment.&lt;ref name="Jarvis, P. 2000"/&gt;

=== Reflexive ===
This attribute requires learning societies to recognise not just the role of lifelong learning within the broader community, but also to enable it to be adaptable to changes, and flexible to specific individual needs. These changes may come about as a result of technological advances, legislative amendments or personal preferences of the individual undertaking the education. According to Jarvis:
(italics)(indent) “...education will be but one more provider of information in the learning market and the educational qualification will become the public recognition of a private process.” &lt;ref name="Jarvis, P. 2000"/&gt;
(normal)(no indent) Thus, it will be the awareness of an individual’s ability to learn that will be of value, rather than what that individual has learned in the past.

=== Global market ===
The final attribute of a learning society requires that, like many products on a global market, education becomes a commodity and that students or participants in the learning process become consumers, able to pick and choose the types of education that they would like, to suit their own personal preferences. This would be facilitated through technological advances that allow students to access learning resources (and qualifications) globally. Under this attribute, education would then become tailored towards providing “customer satisfaction” to become economically justifiable.&lt;ref name="Jarvis, P. 2000"/&gt;

== Current models of learning societies today ==

=== Australia and UK ===
One of the most prevalent examples is the model of the [[Open University|Open Universities]], common in the UK and Australia. They allow students to work towards qualifications accredited by existing higher educational institutions but ‘cherry-pick’ the courses they have a preference for, while at the same time conducting their learning online.
This is best typified by a testimonial found on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100919132046/http://www.open.edu.au/public/home Open Universities Australia] website:
:''“Studying through OUA is very rewarding, particularly if you are a motivated and patient person. It also offers the flexibility that you simply can’t get with a brick-and-mortar university, which is definitely beneficial for some."'' – Open Universities Australia testimonial&lt;ref&gt;Open Universities Australia. (2010, September 10). “Future Students - Open Universities Australia.” Retrieved September 10, 2010, from Open Universities Australia: {{cite web |url=http://www.open.edu.au/public/future-students |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908063554/http://www.open.edu.au/public/future-students |archivedate=2010-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
In 1993, China aimed by the year 2000 to increase to 4% of GDP its spending on education in an effort to move the Chinese population towards being a learning society. It did not meet this target, but in 2009 resolved to meet the same goal by 2020 (which would total some US$200 billion in investment). This proposed investment would address reforms such as:&lt;ref name="chinaeducationblog.com"&gt;Quosdorf, F. (2010, June 14). "China defines road map for becoming a learning society by 2020." Retrieved October 1, 2010, from The China Education Blog: {{cite web |url=http://www.chinaeducationblog.com/education-reform-chinese-education-policy/2010-06-14/china-defines-road-map-for-becoming-a-learning-society-by-2020/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001082619/http://www.chinaeducationblog.com/education-reform-chinese-education-policy/2010-06-14/china-defines-road-map-for-becoming-a-learning-society-by-2020/ |archivedate=2010-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increase private-public sector partnerships in pre-schools
* Increase global stature of universities and higher education institutions
* Improve education standards in rural areas
* Develop non-formal education facilities to allow for lifelong learning (i.e. distance learning, network building)
* Reform of nationwide examination programs
* Digitise learning processes through technology

=== United States ===
On the United States Department of Education website &lt;ref&gt;"United States Department of Education". Retrieved October 1, 2010, from the United States Department of Education: http://www.ed.gov&lt;/ref&gt; there is very little reference to the concept of the learning society. What does exist consists of Taiwan's EduCity of networked schools and classrooms in the National Education Technology Plan 2010&lt;ref name="ed.gov"&gt;United States Department of Education. (2010, May 14). "Support for a learning society." Retrieved October 1, 2010, from United States Department of Education: http://www.ed.gov/technology/netp-2010/support-learning-society-sb&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other ===
The concept of lifelong learning (as facilitated by a learning society) would allow for higher education to be undertaken at any stage of the students life (perhaps even on more than one occasion) rather than at the traditional undergraduate stage.

Based very much in the “world education culture” model”,&lt;ref name="Spring, J. 2009"/&gt; learning societies are seen as being central to competitive knowledge economy in a globalised world.
Advocates of learning societies see traditional institutions as no longer being central to lifelong learning. For example, transnational corporations such as Cisco believe that it will not come about simply through building more schools and universities. These organisations also advocate for the role of lifelong learning within their own structures.&lt;ref name="cisco.com"/&gt;

== Debates regarding learning societies &amp; higher education ==
Debates are argued addressing the role of how existing higher education institutions fit into the concept of the learning society. Despite the traditional argument that the learning society eschews traditional institutions, some advocates of the concept reaffirm the role of universities as being central to where the learning society begins and argue that “the university’s role in society is precisely to learn and understand itself and its environment...The more it addresses the concerns of society in its research, and the more it widens access to all members of society to benefit from the fruits of the research, the more it supports a genuine ‘learning society’” &lt;ref&gt;Laurillard, D. (1999). “A Conversational Framework for Individual Learning Applied to the 'Learning Organisation' and the 'Learning Society'”. Systems Research &amp; Behavioural Science , 16 (2), 113-122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, newly elected [[australians|Australian]] [[prime minister|Prime Minister]] [[Julia Gillard]] reflected the growing diversification of the education sector in her cabinet, by abandoning the role of a traditional ‘Education Minister’ and instead subsuming the role of higher education into a ministerial portfolio that also included jobs, skills and workplace relations – this move was criticised by many high-profile universities in Australia who argued that it undermined the central role of higher education as a place for learning in society.&lt;ref&gt;Tomazin, F. (2010, September 13). “Unis hit Gillard cabinet changes.” The Age , pp. http://www.theage.com.au/federal-election/unis-hit-gillard-cabinet-changes-20100912-15703.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, advocates of the ‘Learning Society’ also call upon partnerships between public and private enterprises to expand the scope of education to allow for more powerful educational learning experiences inside and outside of traditional institutions. These partnerships are seen to increase supplement funding levels (where inadequate public funds exists) as well as open traditional institutions and methods to technology and industry”.&lt;ref name="Spring, J. 2009"/&gt;

One criticism is that the learning society does not actually exist, but is simply a tool or theory invoked by powers (governments, IGO’s) to push certain agendas. This argument maintains that it is easy to see how the idea could be used to justify World Bank &amp; OECD programs in developing countries &lt;ref&gt;Hughes, C., &amp; Tight, M. (1995). “The Myth of the Learning Society”. British Journal of Education Studies , 43 (3), 290-304.&lt;/ref&gt; Or rather that it is nothing more than a vague term to describe an unfocused notion of 'learning on the internet'&lt;ref name="ed.gov"/&gt;

It is often difficult to find, despite the prevalence of the term ‘learning society’ amongst policy makers and politicians, information of real strategic funding from governments or corporations that reflect the theories and approaches of the learning society.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Sackett, P. D. (2010, March 18). Preparing A Learning Society For The Future. Retrieved October 2, 2010, from Chief Scientist for Australia: http://www.chiefscientist.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/100318-CSMR-PMSEIC-final-Media-Release.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to questions being asked of the concept of the learning society, beyond ‘on-the-job’ training corporations may speak of the value of learning, but could it simply be another term for ‘flexibility’ on the part of employees? Is the term simply a term used to define current (yet inevitable) changes in education technology in an increasingly connected world? In the case of China's proposed improvements to their education system,&lt;ref name="chinaeducationblog.com"/&gt; it could be argued that much of the reforms are simply a timeline of general educational upgrades, rather than adhering to any particular philosophy unique to a 'learning society'.

Further, a lack of specificity can exist in much of the literature surrounding the learning society. For example, the Cisco white paper speaks of:
:''"...21st Century skills like collaboration, problem-solving and creativity..."''&lt;ref name="cisco.com"/&gt;
but how these particular skills are unique to the idea of a learning society (as opposed to learning generally) is not clear.

Further, there is criticism that standardisation of assessment and credentialing ignores the cultural differences between global communities, and thus erodes important distinctions that may allow learning and education to be effectively embedded in those cultures”.&lt;ref name="Spring, J. 2009"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5447">'''Linear partial information (LPI)''' is a method of making decisions based on insufficient or [[Fuzzy logic|fuzzy information]]. LPI was introduced in 1970 by Polish–Swiss mathematician [[Edward Kofler]] (1911–2007) to simplify [[Decision making|decision]] processes. Compared to [[Fuzzy set|other methods]] the LPI-fuzziness is [[algorithm]]ically simple and particularly in [[decision making]], more practically oriented. Instead of an [[indicator function]] the decision maker [[linear]]izes any fuzziness by establishing of linear restrictions for fuzzy probability distributions or normalized weights. In the LPI-procedure the decision maker [[linear]]izes any fuzziness instead of applying a membership function. This can be done by establishing [[stochastic]] and non-stochastic LPI-relations. A mixed stochastic and non-stochastic fuzzification is often a basis for the LPI-procedure. By using the LPI-methods any fuzziness in any decision situation can be considered on the base of the [[linear]] [[fuzzy logic]].

== Definition ==
Any Stochastic Partial Information '''SPI(p)''', which can be considered as a solution of a [[linear]] [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] [[system]], is called Linear Partial Information '''LPI(p)''' about probability '''p'''. It can be considered as an LPI-fuzzification of the probability '''p''' corresponding to the concepts of linear fuzzy logic.

== Applications ==
;The MaxEmin Principle
: To obtain the maximally warranted [[expected value]], the decision maker has to choose the [[strategy]] which maximizes the minimal [[expected value]]. This procedure leads to the MaxEmin – Principle and is an extension of the [[Bernoulli's principle]].
;The MaxWmin Principle
: This principle leads to the maximal guaranteed [[weight function]], regarding the extreme weights.
;The Prognostic Decision Principle (PDP)
: This principle is based on the [[prognostic|prognosis]] interpretation of strategies under fuzziness.

== Fuzzy equilibrium and stability ==
Despite the fuzziness of information, it is often necessary to choose the optimal, most cautious strategy, for example in economic planning, in conflict situations or in daily decisions. This is impossible without the concept of fuzzy equilibrium. The concept of fuzzy stability is considered as an extension into a time interval, taking into account the corresponding stability area of the decision maker. The more complex is the model, the softer a choice has to be considered. 
The idea of fuzzy equilibrium is based on the optimization principles. Therefore, the MaxEmin-, MaxGmin- and PDP-stability have to be analyzed. The violation of these principles leads often to wrong predictions and decisions.

== LPI  equilibrium point ==
Considering a given LPI-decision model, as a [[convolution]] of the corresponding fuzzy states or a disturbance set, the fuzzy equilibrium strategy remains the most cautious one, despite of the presence of the fuzziness. Any deviation from this strategy can cause a loss for the decision maker.

'''Lipid droplets''', also referred to as lipid bodies, [[oil body|oil bodies]] or adiposomes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Sally|author2=Parton, Robert G. |title=Lipid droplets: a unified view of a dynamic organelle|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|date=8 March 2006|volume=7|issue=5|pages=373–378|doi=10.1038/nrm1912|pmid=16550215}}&lt;/ref&gt; are lipid-rich cellular [[organelle]]s that regulate the storage and [[hydrolysis]] of neutral lipids and are found largely in the adipose tissue.&lt;ref name="mehta"&gt;[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/10/mobilization-and-cellular-uptake-of-stored-fats-triacylglycerols-with-animation/ Mobilization and cellular uptake of stored fats and triacylglycerol (with Animation)]&lt;/ref&gt; They also serve as a reservoir for [[cholesterol]] and acyl-glycerols for membrane formation and maintenance. Lipid droplets are found in all eukaryotic organisms and store a large portion of [[lipids]] in mammalian [[adipocyte]]s. Initially, these lipid droplets were considered to merely serve as fat depots, but since the discovery in the 1990s of proteins in the lipid droplet coat that regulate lipid droplet dynamics and lipid metabolism, lipid droplets are seen as highly dynamic organelles that play a very important role in the regulation of intracellular lipid storage and lipid metabolism. The role of lipid droplets outside of lipid and cholesterol storage has recently begun to be elucidated and includes a close association to inflammatory responses through the synthesis and metabolism of [[eicosanoid]]s and to metabolic disorders such as [[obesity]], cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bozza|first=PT|author2=Viola, JP |title=Lipid droplets in inflammation, cancer|journal=Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes, and Essential Fatty Acids|date=Apr–Jun 2010|volume=82|issue=4–6|pages=243–50|pmid=20206487|doi=10.1016/j.plefa.2010.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melo|first=Rossana C.

Alternatively, fatty acids can be converted to lipid intermediates like diacylglycerol (DAG), ceramides and fatty acyl-CoAs. These lipid intermediates can impair insulin signaling, which is referred to as lipid-induced insulin resistance and lipotoxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bosma | first1 = M | last2 = Kersten | first2 = S | last3 = Hesselink | first3 = MKC | last4 = Schrauwen | first4 = P | year = 2012 | title = Re-evaluating lipotoxic triggers in skeletal muscle: Relating intramyocellular lipid metabolism to insulin sensitivity | url = | journal = Prog Lipid Res | volume = 51 | issue = | pages = 36–49 | doi = 10.1016/j.plipres.2011.11.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lipid droplets also serve as platforms for protein binding and degradation.

Lipid droplets vary greatly in size, ranging from 20-40&amp;nbsp;nm to 100&amp;nbsp;um.&lt;ref name="Guo 749–52"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Guo Y, Cordes KR, Farese RV, Walther TC |title=Lipid droplets at a glance.|journal=Journal of Cell Science|date=Mar 15, 2009|volume=122|issue=Pt 6|pages=749–52|pmid=19261844|doi=10.1242/jcs.037630|pmc=2714424}}&lt;/ref&gt; In adipocytes, lipid bodies tend to be larger and they may compose the majority of the cell, while in other cells they may only be induced under certain conditions and are considerably smaller in size.

==Formation==

Although the exact mechanism of formation of lipid droplets is still unknown, it is proposed that they bud off the membrane of the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] as TAGs are collected between the two layers of its [[lipid bilayer|phospholipid membrane]]. Lipid droplet growth can consequently happen through direct diffusion of fatty acids, endocytosis of sterols or by fusion of smaller lipid droplets through the aid of [[SNARE (protein)|SNARE proteins]].&lt;ref name="Guo 749–52"/&gt; Lipid droplets have also been observed to be created by the fission of existing lipid droplets, though this is thought to be less common than ''de novo'' formation.&lt;ref name="Wilfling 39-45"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilfling|first=Florian|author2=Haas, J.|author3=Walther, T.|author4=Farese, R.|title=Lipid droplet biogenesis|journal=Current Opinion in Cell Biology|date=August 2014|volume=29|pages=39–45|doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2014.03.008|pmc=4526149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of lipid droplets from the endoplasmic reticulum begins with the synthesis of the neutral lipids to be transported. The manufacture of TAGs from diacylglycerol (by the addition of a fatty acyl chain) is catalyzed by the [[Diglyceride acyltransferase|DGAT]] proteins, though the extent to which these and other proteins are required depends on cell type.&lt;ref name="Harris 657-667"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=Charles|author2=et. al.|title=DGAT enzymes are required for triacylglycerol synthesis and lipid droplets in adipocytes|journal=Journal of Lipid Research|date=April 2011|volume=52|issue=4|pages=657–667|doi=10.1194/jlr.M013003|pmid=21317108|pmc=3284159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither DGAT1 nor DGAT2 is singularly essential for TAG synthesis or droplet formation, though mammalian cells lacking both cannot form lipid droplets and have severely stunted TAG synthesis. DGAT1, which seems to prefer exogenous fatty acid substrates, is not essential for life; DGAT2, which seems to prefer endogenously synthesized fatty acids, is.&lt;ref name="Wilfling 39-45"/&gt;

In non-adipocytes, lipid storage, lipid droplet synthesis and lipid droplet growth can be induced by various stimuli including [[growth factor]]s, long-chain [[Unsaturated fat|unsaturated fatty acids]] (including [[oleic acid]] and [[arachidonic acid]]), oxidative stress and inflammatory stimuli such bacterial [[lipopolysaccharide]]s, various microbial pathogens, [[platelet-activating factor]], [[eicosanoids]], and [[cytokines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melo|first=R.

The M.R.M. degree requires completion of six required courses (social science in [[natural resource management]], [[ecology]], [[ecological economics]], [[earth systems]], research methods), six elective courses, a [[field workshop]], and a [[research project]].

The aim is to increase familiarity and competence in understanding the dynamics of natural resources, the strategies and techniques of natural resource and [[environmental planning]] and management, and the biological, physical, social, economic and institutional implications of resource decisions. Students also become familiar with various quantitative methods of analysis and aids to [[decision making]]. In the field of natural resources, in particular, it is important that an academic degree provide a foundation for problem-solving as well as creative and critical thinking rather than focus primarily on subject matter such as [[fisheries]], economics, or forestry.

Graduate student research projects required to complete the degree evaluate the effectiveness of existing natural resource management policies and, where appropriate, present alternatives. Students apply a range of approaches including [[cost-benefit analysis]], [[simulation modeling]], legal and institutional assessment frameworks, and social surveys to address critical and emerging natural resource management issues on local, national, and international scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rem.sfu.ca/research/publications/|title=REM Publications|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS) has a number of programs aimed at '''Mission blue butterfly habitat conservation''', which include lands traditionally inhabited by the [[Mission blue butterfly]], an [[endangered species]]. A recovery plan, drawn up by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1984, outlined the need to protect Mission blue habitat and to repair habitat damaged by urbanization, off highway vehicle traffic, and invasion by exotic, non-native plants.&lt;ref name="Biogeo"&gt;[http://online.sfsu.edu/bholzman/courses/Fall00Projects/MissionBlue.htm The Biogeography of the Mission Blue Butterfly (''Icaricia icarioides missionensis'')], San Francisco State University, Department of Geography, Autumn 2000&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the type of work being done by governmental and citizen agencies can be found at the Marin Headlands in the [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]]. In addition, regular wildfires have opened new habitat conservation opportunities as well as damaging existing ones.

==Marin Headlands==
{{see also|Marin Headlands}}
[[Image:Marin headlands 6-9-05.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The Marin Headlands from Immigrant Point Overlook]]
The program at the Marin Headlands for Mission blue butterfly habitat protection aims to deal with one of the main problems facing the Mission blue butterfly population. The Headlands area was once owned by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. From 1870 on, the Army used the area for forts such as [[Fort Cronkhite]], coastal batteries such as those that protected the [[San Francisco Bay]] during WW II, and missile sites, such as the 280 that occupied the area during the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;Yamamoto, Marta. [http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/article.cfm?archiveDate=01-03-05&amp;storyID=20443 Marin Headlands Whispers Stories of Bygone Days By], Berkeley Daily Planet, Jan. 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; While in the Marin Headlands, the Army planted a lot of trees, so many that today the non-native, [[invasive species]] that occupy the Headlands threaten the habitat of the Mission blue butterfly. The habitat protection program seeks to root out these species from selected areas of the Marin Headlands. Some of the species that have now become native to the area and threaten the habitat of the endangered Mission blue butterfly include [[Eucalyptus globulus|blue gum eucalyptus]], [[Monterey cypress]], [[Monterey pine]] and [[Acacia melanoxylon|blackwood acacia]]. The Mission Blue Butterfly UserFee Project in the headlands will try to remove these species and [[Revegetation|revegetate]] the area with native coastal prairie plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/archive/goga/admin/feedemo/projects/project_missionblue.htm Mission blue butterfly habitat protection], Golden Gate National Recreation Area, National Park Service&lt;/ref&gt;

==San Bruno Mountain==
{{see also|San Bruno Mountain}}
[[Image:Fog San Bruno Mountain.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fog coming off of [[San Bruno Mountain]]]]
Another major conservation effort is underway at San Bruno Mountain. A large area of Mission blue butterfly habitat has been protected under the auspices of the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]]. In all, the San Bruno Mountain habitat conservation program has protected over {{convert|3500|acre|km2}} of habitat since 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ecos.fws.gov/species_profile/servlet/gov.doi.species_profile.servlets.Species_HCP Habitat conservation plans], Mission Blue Butterfly, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&lt;/ref&gt; San Bruno Mountain was the site of the nation's first [[Habitat Conservation Plan]] (HCP), intended to protect the habitat of the Mission blue butterfly. However HCPs remain controversial.

The controversy over HCPs lie in their implementation. The San Bruno HCP came about in 1982. By that year local residents had created [[San Bruno Mountain State Park|San Bruno Mountain State and County Park]], which held {{convert|1950|acre|km2}} of the 3,600 on the mountain, in order to protect the habitat of the Mission blue butterfly. Then, the butterfly began to turn up on private land. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service formed a committee with landowners, developers, local governments, the [[California Department of Fish and Game]], and others to craft the first HCP in 1982 "to address problems caused by the presence of endangered butterflies on San Bruno Mountain." HCPs do not include any independent scientific review, thus none exists. The plan became the model for the 1983 amendment to the Endangered Species Act.&lt;ref name="HCP"&gt;[http://www.coastalconservancy.ca.gov/coast&amp;ocean/spring2001/pages/thre.htm The first ever HCP], ''California Coast &amp; Ocean'', Spring 2001, California Coastal Conservancy&lt;/ref&gt;

HCPs work like this. In exchange for permission to build over the top of the prime habitat of two California endangered butterflies, the Mission blue and the [[San Bruno elfin butterfly]], landowners agreed to measures to improve the prospects for the species' survival in other locations. This particular HCP allowed the development of {{convert|368|acre|km2}} to {{convert|828|acre|km2}}. Property owners who located in this area were required to offer land and funds to conserve and improve habitat in other locales around San Bruno Mountain. Property holders are also assessed for a Habitat Conservation Trust Fund which pays for species monitoring, alien plant removal and other tasks on the "donated" land slated for habitat. One such area on San Bruno Mountain was along the northeast ridge. There, a residential community was built over prime Mission blue habitat, a habitat that was supposed to be restored on the saddle of the mountain. However, the mountain's saddle is colder, damper and windier. On top of this, the saddle is overgrown with an invasive species, gorse, while the Mission blue requires lupine as its host plant.&lt;ref name="HCP"/&gt;

The environmental consulting firm, [[Thomas Reid Associates]] (TRA) crafted the plan and work to carry out the HCPs biological program and monitors the results. In addition, they have conducted the biological studies and environmental impact studies required under the HCP. TRA works with others to stop exotic plant invasions on butterfly habitat and began to undertake the daunting task of replacing the gorse infested saddle with lupine for the butterflies to relocate to. The project started in 1985. [[Gorse]] is a hardy plant that can reach heights of {{convert|20|ft|m}} with deep root systems. TRA tried multiple methods to destroy the invasive species, including herbicides and burning. By April the unfazed gorse bloomed a bright yellow. In 2001, 16 years after the project began, {{convert|100|acre|km2}} of 330 original-acres remained covered in gorse.&lt;ref name="HCP"/&gt;
[[Image:San Bruno mountain distance.jpg|thumb|right|200px|San Bruno Mountain, viewed from San Francisco's [[Mount Davidson (California)|Mount Davidson]] to the north, with the Sunnyside, Balboa Park, Excelsior and Crocker Amazon neighborhoods in the foreground.]]

The Sacramento Fish and Wildlife Office is in charge of the plats under conservation at San Bruno Mountain and Parkside Homes. Parkside Homes is the newest habitat conservation plan or agreement and involves a twenty-five acre residential community in South San Francisco. The area is home to non-native and native species which include lupines, [[sedum]], and [[viola]]. The permit was issued in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecos.fws.gov/conserv_plans/servlet/gov.doi.hcp.servlets.PlanReport?plan_id=89&amp;region=8&amp;type=HCP&amp;rtype=1 Parkside Homes], Habitat Conservation Plan, Conservation Plans and Agreements Database, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&lt;/ref&gt;

The original conservation permit for San Bruno Mountain was issued in 1983 and encompassed {{convert|3500|acre|km2}} of mixed use land in San Mateo County. The Mission blue is among other endangered species in the 1983 parcel of land. Other animals include the [[San Bruno elfin butterfly]], and the [[San Francisco garter snake]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecos.fws.gov/conserv_plans/servlet/gov.doi.hcp.servlets.PlanReport?plan_id=57&amp;region=8&amp;type=HCP&amp;rtype=1 San Bruno Mountain Amendment #1 (South Slope)], Habitat Conservation Plan, Conservation Plans and Agreements Database, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1985, another {{convert|203|acre|km2}} of land came under the auspices of the Sacramento office. The area, known as "South Slope" is another mixed use area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecos.fws.gov/conserv_plans/servlet/gov.doi.hcp.servlets.PlanReport?plan_id=56&amp;region=8&amp;type=HCP&amp;rtype=1 San Bruno Mountain], Habitat Conservation Plan, Conservation Plans and Agreements Database, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&lt;/ref&gt; Three other amendments to the San Bruno Mountain conservation agreement added 10, 19, and {{convert|227|acre|km2}} in 1985, 1986 and 1990, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecos.fws.gov/species_profile/servlet/gov.doi.species_profile.servlets.Species_HCPMission Blue Butterfly], Habitat Conservation Plans, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fort Baker==
{{see also|Fort Baker}}
[[Image:Fort baker golden gate.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Abandoned buildings at [[Fort Baker]] are dwarfed by the [[Golden Gate Bridge]].]]
Fort Baker is an abandoned base formerly occupied by the U.S. Army. It is near the city of [[Sausalito, California]]. The military announced the post's closure in 1995. By 2001, it had been ceded to the National Park Service.

An {{convert|8+1/4|acre|ha}} area of non-native Monterey pine and tea trees are invading part of a habitat at Fort Baker. The Fort Baker area is a "top vegetation and wildlife management priority" for the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. As part of the mission to protect Mission blue habitat the project will seek to physically remove and/or contain those species in areas within or adjacent to the "host plant" ''[[Lupinus albifrons]]''. Upon completion, the area will be completely invasive-tree free.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/archive/pore/science_catalog_restore.htm#project7 Fort Baker Mission Blue Butterfly Habitat Restoration], Point Reyes Nat'l Seashore, Catalog of Future Research Opportunities in Bay Area National Parks&lt;/ref&gt;

A pitched legal battle was waged for years over the fate of some of the Fort Baker lands, the players: the city of Sausalito, California, and the National Park Service (NPS). Sausalito and the National Park Service go back in legal battles several years but they also work together at times, sometimes to the benefit of one party or the other, as U.S. Department of Interior appropriations will reveal. In 1999, the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for FY 1999 made a "general provisions" dealing with the city of Sausalito and the Department of Interior. Basically stating that the NPS owned land at Fort Baker was property tax exempt and exempt from any kind of special assessment from the state of California, county of Marin, or city of Sausalito.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&amp;sid=cp105DxSLh&amp;refer=&amp;r_n=hr825.105&amp;db_id=105&amp;item=&amp;sel=TOC_3910374&amp; House Report 105-825], General Provisions-Department of Interior, Library of Congress, THOMAS&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mission blue 1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A Mission blue butterfly (''I. missionensis'') perched]]
The legal battle ensued when the National Park Service announced plans to finally allow a development group to build a large, long-awaited hotel/conference center complex on the remains of Fort Baker. The NPS first announced their intention to develop Fort Baker in 1980's Golden Gate National Recreation Area General Management Plan which proclaimed that Fort Baker would become a conference center. The group, Fort Baker Retreat Group LLC - is an amalgam of Passport Resorts, a hotel management company; Equity Community Builders, the development manager; and Ajax Capital, a financial partner. Talk about development at the site, managed by the Park Service, first began in earnest in 1998. By 2001, the city of Sausalito had filed suit to force an injunction against the Park Service's plan to go ahead with the project. The suit lingered in court for several years. The essential quarrel was over the size of the project which looked to be approaching the maximum size of 350 rooms as adopted in the June 2000 original Fort Baker Plan.&lt;ref name="Bowa"&gt;Bowa, Carla. [http://www.marinij.com/marin/ci_3490930 History, modernization blend for retreat-conference center], ''Marin Independent Journal'', Feb. 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The suit alleged, however, that the NPS violated numerous environmental laws during the development of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the project. The EIS was completed in 1999 and included the NPS' preferred alternative to the hotel/conference center. The alternative, {{convert|42|acre|m2}} of habitat, 23 specifically for the Mission blue butterfly, to be preserved, improved or repaired.&lt;ref name="Sausalito"&gt;[http://www.olemiss.edu/orgs/SGLC/National/SandBar/3.4sausalito.htm Sausalito Has Standing to Sue to Stop Redevelopment of National Recreation Area] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913134230/http://www.olemiss.edu/orgs/SGLC/National/SandBar/3.4sausalito.htm |date=2006-09-13 }}, National Sea Grant Law Center, University of Mississippi&lt;/ref&gt; Sausalito's 2001 suit also alleged that the EIS was "deficient."

It was not until October 20, 2004 that a judgement was handed down in the case. In ''City of Sausalito v. O'Neill'' the [[9th Circuit Court of Appeals]] said that Sausalito did have standing to sue the NPS for an injunction to halt the hotel project at Fort Baker. The 2004 ruling proclaimed "standing" according to [[Article III of the U.S. Constitution]]. Article III requires that the defendant has suffered an "injury in fact", the injury is fairly traceable and it is likely that the injury will be repaired by a decision in favor of the defendant. The court found that Sausalito had an "injury in fact" because the Fort Baker project could attract up to 2,700 visitors per day, impacting traffic, aesthetic appeal and revenue in Sausalito.&lt;ref name="Sausalito"/&gt;

The court also found that the city had statutory standing for the [[injunction]] suit as well. That authority came under the [[Coastal Zone Management Act]] (CZMA), and the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972|Marine Mammal Protection Act]] (MMPA). The decision, however, was not a total victory for the city of Sausalito. The court rejected the city's claims under the NPS Organics Act and the [[Concessions Management Improvement Act]] (CMIA) and the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act]] (MBTA). The court rulings on the other statutory claims are as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*'''ESA''': The law requires consulting the USFWS or [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] if federal activities might result in a taking. The 9th Circuit held that the NPS had consulted with USFWS as well as the NMFS during the evolution of the Fort Baker plan. Furthermore, the court held that the NPS had incorporated mitigation measures as recommended by the NMFS for [[salmonids]] and by the USFWS for the Mission blue butterfly into their final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). They had complied with the Endangered Species Act.&lt;ref name="Sausalito"/&gt;
*'''MMPA''': The MMPA prohibits the taking of endangered or threatened species. The city argued that the National Park Service (NPS) failed to secure appropriate permits for takings as a result of construction activities associated with the Fort Baker plan. Since neither party had fully covered this issue in district court the 9th Circuit remanded the claim for an initial ruling on its merits.&lt;ref name="Sausalito"/&gt;
*'''MBTA''': Under this law it is unlawful to hunt, kill, or capture a [[migratory bird]]. There is an exception to this law and it revolves around habitat destruction. Habitat destruction does not effect a taking under the MBTA. The court ruled that the NPS did not have to seek MBTA authorization. This is because birds will only be distributed through habitat modification.&lt;ref name="Sausalito"/&gt;
*'''CZMA''': The coastal management program for the San Francisco Bay Area, federally approved, allows limited commercial recreational facilities within waterfront parks. They must be incidental to park use and not restrict public access to the bay, however. Both federal and state coastal management plans must be consistent with each other under CZMA. The "Bay Commission" determined that the NPS' Fort Baker plan was consistent with the Bay Plan. The city of Sausalito claimed that the Bay Commission's consistency determination did not satisfy the CZMA. The court concurred with the city on this point. It held that the NPS' consistency determination was based on improper ground, a general insufficient funding claim. The court remanded this claim, under the CZMA, to the district court for further proceedings.&lt;ref name="Sausalito"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though the court rejected Sausalito's claims under the NPS Organic Act, the CMIA and the Omnibus Act the 9th Circuits findings for the city were a victory. Both the MMPA and CZMA claims were remanded back to district court for further inquiry. This helped lead to a settlement the next year.&lt;ref name="Sausalito"/&gt; The entire affair was settled in 2005 when the city and the Park Service came to an agreement which resulted in the project being trimmed down to a 144-room hotel complex. The settlement actually capped the room capacity at a higher 225.&lt;ref name="Bowa"/&gt;

==Twin Peaks==
{{see also|Twin Peaks, San Francisco, California}}
[[Image:SF from Twin Peaks.jpg|thumb|left|150px|San Francisco from [[Twin Peaks (San Francisco, California)|Twin Peaks]]]]
The Twin Peaks, icons of the San Francisco Bay Area, are also home to a reported population of Mission blue butterflies. The entire area is a park managed by the [[San Francisco Recreation &amp; Parks Department]] (SFRPD). The park contains {{convert|31|acre|m2}} of what the Park Department terms "Natural Areas." This area is most of the park minus roads, viewpoints and the City Fire Department reservoir. The natural areas contain significant resources for preservation. They include some of the largest areas of coastal [[scrubland|scrub]] and [[prairie]] that remains within the city of San Francisco. These, being the preferred habitat of the Mission blue, are areas that support and provide habitat for the butterfly. Twin Peaks receives heavy recreational use because of its picturesque view of the city. Twin Peaks supports a wide array of habitat types, from mixed forest to coastal scrub. Among the coastal scrub and prairies are [[silver bush lupine]] plants (''L. albifrons'') which support the colonies of endangered Mission blues.&lt;ref name="TwinPeaks"&gt;[http://www.parks.sfgov.org/wcm_recpark/SNRAMP_Final_Draft/6_Site-Specific/68TwinPeaks.pdf Significant Natural Areas Management Plan, Twin Peaks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030752/http://www.parks.sfgov.org/wcm_recpark/SNRAMP_Final_Draft/6_Site-Specific/68TwinPeaks.pdf |date=2007-09-30 }}, San Francisco Recreation &amp; Parks Department, Feb. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mission blue was first reported in Twin Peaks in 1979; since then SFRPD staff confirmed their continued presence in 2000 and 2001. Protocols for monitoring include egg surveys on [[lupin]]e plants at regular time intervals throughout the spring. In 2000, surveys found 56 eggs on 115 plants in the southern part of Twin Peaks. May 2001 surveys reconfirmed the original finding, albeit in smaller numbers. That year 14 eggs were found on 15 silver bush lupine plants.&lt;ref name="TwinPeaks"/&gt; Between 2001 and 2007, SF Parks and Rec found only two adults and two larvae. In April 2009, a [https://www.webcitation.org/5oqhFOd40?url=http://sfgov.org/site/uploadedfiles/recpark/missionbluebutterflyFINAL.pdf reintroduction was attempted] with the release of 22 butterflies from the San Bruno population.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mission blue 2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A Mission blue butterfly]] --&gt;
In February 2006, the San Francisco Recreation &amp; Parks Department released its "Significant Natural Resource Areas Management Plan." The plan outlines site specific recommendations for the more than {{convert|800|acre|km2}} in over 30 San Francisco parks designated Significant Natural Resource Areas. The site specific plan for Twin Peaks covers the issue of habitat conservation for the Mission blue. The plan recommends that priority be given to "maintaining the habitat necessary for Mission blue butterflies, especially the host plant (silver bush lupine)." The silver bush lupine is common in and around Twin Peaks. In addition the Management Plan recommended that the Mission blue population at Twin Peaks]The [[Twin Peaks (San Francisco, California)|Twin Peaks]] be monitored and the host plant populations should be augmented whenever possible.&lt;ref name="TwinPeaks"/&gt;

The Mission blue is the only federally endangered animal at Twin Peaks; however, the [[Bay checkerspot butterfly]] is a federally threatened species. Aside from these, the park at Twin peaks is home to about 20 other species that are threatened or endangered at a local level.  Most threatened species at Twin Peaks are of local concern only.&lt;ref name="TwinPeaks"/&gt;

== Fire rehabilitation ==
Popular thought is that the host plants, [[lupin]]es, require periodic disturbances in order to successfully reproduce. Many possible natural disturbances are actively worked against by humans, such as fire and landslides because areas are designed with a dual use purpose in mind, often for recreational use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://essig.berkeley.edu/endins/mission.htm Mission Blue Butterfly], Essig Museum of Entomology, University of California, Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solstice fire===
[[Image:Solstice fire restoration area.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The area where the Solstice fire occurred is under restoration.]]
In June 2004, the Solstice Fire burned near Sausalito, California. The fire started when an errant "international visitor" had a fire mishap while camping. This fire threatened historical buildings which a public-private partnership planned to turn into a conference center. The building was spared but a stand of non-native [[Monterey pine]]s was not so lucky. The Monterey pine, a pesky invasive species that has become "naturalized," is continually encroaching on the coastal grasslands that the Mission blue butterfly prefers and requires. Over 250 trees were removed from the area after the fire, burnt remnants of what they once were. The charred trees were chipped and the chips utilized in an electric generation facility as well as on site to control [[Delairea odorata|cape ivy]], another invasive species.&lt;ref name="Fireplan"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.fireplan.gov/overview/documents/06_ca_nps_gogate_hfr.pdf |title=Restoration after Solstice Fire Reduces Fuel and Improves Grassland Health |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |publisher=[[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area that was cut was seeded with native plants. Among them, [[purple needle grass]], in  fall 2004 and again in fall 2005 about one pound of purple needle grass seed was sowed directly on the burn site. 400 summer lupine seedlings were also planted, most were grown in nearby nurseries while some were collected in the Marin Headlands. Still, both plants are forced to compete with non-native [[Italian thistle]] and [[French broom]].&lt;ref name="Fireplan"/&gt;

===Lateral fire===
[[Image:French broom burn site lateral fire.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Invasive [[French broom]] has moved into the area of the Lateral fire burn.]]
The August 2004 "Lateral Fire" started, again, within Fort Baker, a half mile south of Sausalito, California. Besides threatening urban area, and historic buildings the fire threatened the habitat of the Mission blue. The fire happened within a {{convert|17|acre|m2|sing=on}} habitat restoration project and burned areas of the butterfly's host lupine plant, ''Lupinus albifrons''. Mission blues lay their eggs on ''L. albifrons'' each year. The fire burned about 300 plants. The U.S. federal government responded per the [[National Fire Plan]].&lt;ref name="Fireplan2"&gt;[http://www.fireplan.gov/overview/documents/05_CA_NPS-goga-MissionBlue-rehab.pdf Non-native Plant Control After Wildfire Protects Butterfly Habitat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315083818/http://www.fireplan.gov/overview/documents/05_CA_NPS-goga-MissionBlue-rehab.pdf |date=2007-03-15 }} ([[PDF]]), Golden Gate National Recreation Area, National Fire Plan--Rehabilitation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Control of non-native species trying to reinvade the area was cited as a key measure in protecting the lupines, essential to Mission blue survival. The non-native French broom and Italian thistle were among the culprits seeking to re-enter coastal grass and scrubland. It was French broom which required the most intensive work to prevent reemergence. Three types of treatments were implemented in the effort to control French broom:

*mulching with weed free rice straw
*flaming with handheld [[propane torch]]
*dislodging or cutting with a hula hoe

[[Image:Mission blue 3.JPG|thumb|left|160px|The endangered Mission blue butterfly inhabited the area of the lateral fire.]]
When these techniques were applied to seedlings within two months of [[germination]], they were 90% effective. French broom seed stores were vast and the treatments required multiple applications. A huge new wave of French broom seeds followed three separate flaming treatments and a massive hand pulling of the invasive plant followed up the flame activity. The propane torches proved less successful against Italian thistle which was controlled utilizing mostly a hand pulling and [[herbicide]] combination. In an attempt to rehab the burned areas weed-free straw wattles and weed-free straw mulch to help with erosion control. Following the fire, monitoring was conducted and three findings were considered especially significant. First, about half of the area's lupines survived the fire and an increased number germinated after the fire. Live Mission blue caterpillars were found on a number of burned lupine plants. According to the life cycle of the Mission blue, these eggs would have had to have been laid before the fire. This would indicate that the butterflies, albeit in the early larval stages, survived the Lateral Fire.&lt;ref name="Fireplan2"/&gt;

'''Musica universalis''' (literally '''universal music'''), also called '''Music of the spheres''' or '''Harmony of the Spheres''', is an ancient [[philosophy|philosophical]] concept that regards proportions in the movements of [[celestial bodies]]—the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and [[planet]]s—as a form of ''musica'' (the [[Medieval]] [[Latin]] term for [[music]]). This "music" is not usually thought to be literally audible, but a [[harmonic]], [[mathematics|mathematical]] or [[religious]] concept.  The idea continued to appeal to thinkers about music until the end of the [[Renaissance]], influencing scholars of many kinds, including [[humanism|humanists]].  Further scientific exploration has determined specific proportions in some orbital motion, described as [[orbital resonance]].

{{See also|Pythagoreanism#Music and harmony}}

The discovery of the precise relation between the pitch of the musical note and the length of the string that produces it is attributed to Pythagoras.
The Music of the Spheres incorporates the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] principle that mathematical relationships express qualities or "tones" of energy which manifest in numbers, visual angles, shapes and sounds – all connected within a pattern of proportion. [[Pythagoras]]  first identified that the [[Pitch (music)|pitch of a musical note]] is in inverse proportion to the length of the string that produces it, and that intervals between harmonious sound frequencies form simple numerical ratios.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Weiss-2008|Weiss and Taruskin (2008)]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=q1eobgND8H4C&amp;pg=PA3 p. 3].&lt;/ref&gt;  In a theory known as the Harmony of the Spheres, Pythagoras proposed that the Sun, Moon and planets all emit their own unique hum based on their orbital revolution,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Pliny-77|Pliny the Elder (77)]] pp. 277–8, (II.xviii.xx): "…occasionally Pythagoras draws on the theory of music, and designates the distance between the Earth and the Moon as a whole tone, that between the Moon and Mercury as a semitone, .... the seven tones thus producing the so-called diapason, ''i.e.''. a universal harmony".&lt;/ref&gt; and that the quality of life on Earth reflects the tenor of celestial sounds which are physically imperceptible to the human ear.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Houlding-2000|Houlding (2000)]] p. 28: 

For [[Philolaus]], mathematician and Pythagorean astronomer, working around 400 BC, the world was 'harmony and numbers'; everything is ordered according to proportions that correspond to three basic musical intervals: 2:1 (harmony), 3:2 (fifth), 4:3 (fourth). Nicomachus of Gerasa (also a Pythagorean, towards the year 200 BC) assigns the notes of the octave to the celestial bodies, so that they generate a music.
"The doctrine of the Pythagoreans was a combination of science and mysticism… Like Anaximenes they viewed the Universe as one integrated, living organism, surrounded by Divine Air (or more literally 'Breath'), which permeates and animates the whole cosmos and filters through to individual creatures … By partaking of the core essence of the Universe, the individual is said to act as a microcosm in which all the laws in the macrocosm of the Universe are at work".&lt;/ref&gt;   Subsequently, Plato described astronomy and music as "twinned" studies of sensual recognition: astronomy for the eyes, music for the ears, and both requiring knowledge of numerical proportions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Davis-1901|Davis (1901)]] p. 252. Plato's ''Republic'' VII.XII reads: "As the eyes, said I, seem formed for studying astronomy, so do the ears seem formed for harmonious motions: and these seem to be twin sciences to one another, as also the Pythagoreans say".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] criticised the notion&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, On the Heavens, J.L. Stocks' translation, http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/heavens.2.ii.html&lt;/ref&gt; that celestial bodies make a sound in moving in the context of his own cosmological model. &lt;blockquote&gt;From all this it is clear that the theory that the movement of the stars produces a harmony, i.e. that the sounds they make are concordant, in spite of the grace and originality with which it has been stated, is nevertheless untrue. Some thinkers suppose that the motion of bodies of that size must produce a noise, since on our earth the motion of bodies far inferior in size and in speed of movement has that effect. Also, when the sun and the moon, they say, and all the stars, so great in number and in size, are moving with so rapid a motion, how should they not produce a sound immensely great? Starting from this argument and from the observation that their speeds, as measured by their distances, are in the same ratios as musical concordances, they assert that the sound given forth by the circular movement of the stars is a harmony. Since, however, it appears unaccountable that we should not hear this music, they explain this by saying that the sound is in our ears from the very moment of birth and is thus indistinguishable from its contrary silence, since sound and silence are discriminated by mutual contrast. What happens to men, then, is just what happens to coppersmiths, who are so accustomed to the noise of the smithy that it makes no difference to them. But, as we said before, melodious and poetical as the theory is, it cannot be a true account of the facts. There is not only the absurdity of our hearing nothing, the ground of which they try to remove, but also the fact that no effect other than sensitive is produced upon us. Excessive noises, we know, shatter the solid bodies even of inanimate things: the noise of thunder, for instance, splits rocks and the strongest of bodies. But if the moving bodies are so great, and the sound which penetrates to us is proportionate to their size, that sound must needs reach us in an intensity many times that of thunder, and the force of its action must be immense.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The three branches of the Medieval concept of musica were presented by [[Boethius]] in his book ''De Musica'':&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, De institutione musica, I.2 (p. 187 Friedlein ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''musica mundana'' (sometimes referred to as ''musica universalis'')
* ''musica humana'' (the internal music of the human body)
* ''musica quae in quibusdam constituta est instrumentis'' (sounds made by singers and instrumentalists)

According to [[Max Heindel]]'s [[Rosicrucian]] writings, the heavenly "music of the spheres" is heard in the ''Region of Concrete Thought'', the lower region of the [[mental plane]], which is an ocean of harmony.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

M''usica universalis'', which had existed since the Greeks, as a metaphysical concept was often taught in [[quadrivium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Voelkel|first=J. R.|date=1994|title=The music of the heavens: Kepler's harmonic astronomy|url=|journal=Physics Today|volume=48(6)|pages=59-60|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this connection between music and astronomy intrigued Johannes Kepler, and he devoted much of his time after publishing the [[Mysterium Cosmographicum|''Mysterium'' ''Cosmographicum'']] (Mystery of the Cosmos) looking over tables and trying to fit the data to what he believed to be the true nature of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mysterium Cosmographicum|last=Kepler|first=Johannes|year=1596|location=Tubingen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28293391|title=Kepler|last=1880-1956.|first=Caspar, Max,|date=1993|publisher=Dover Publications|others=Hellman, Clarisse Doris, 1910-1973.|isbn=0486676056|location=New York|oclc=28293391}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1619 Kepler published ''Harmonices Mundi'' (literally Harmony of the Worlds), expanding on the concepts he introduced in ''Mysterium'' and positing that [[Interval (music)|musical intervals]] and [[Harmony|harmonies]] describe the motions of the six known planets of the time.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36826094|title=The harmony of the world|last=1571-1630.|first=Kepler, Johannes,|date=1997|publisher=American Philosophical Society|others=Aiton, E. J., Duncan, A. M. (Alistair Matheson), Field, Judith Veronica.|isbn=0871692090|location=[Philadelphia, Pa.]|oclc=36826094}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that this harmony, while inaudible, could be heard by the soul, and that it gave a “very agreeable feeling of bliss, afforded him by this music in the imitation of God.” In ''Harmonices'', Kepler laid out an argument for a creator who had made an explicit connection between geometry, astronomy, and music, and that the planets were arranged in intelligently.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Planetary_Musical_Scales_from_Harmony_of_the_Worlds.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Planetary_Musical_Scales_from_Harmony_of_the_Worlds.jpg|thumb|359x359px|Page from Kepler's ''Harmonices Mundi''. The scales of each of the six known planets, and the moon, placed on five-line staffs.]]
''Harmonices'' is split into five books, or chapters. The first and second books give a brief discussion on [[regular polyhedron]] and their [[Congruence (geometry)|congruences]], reiterating the idea he introduced in ''Mysterium'' that the five regular solids known about since antiquity define the orbits of the planets and their distances from the sun. Book three focuses on defining musical harmonies, including [[consonance and dissonance]], intervals (including the problems of just tuning), their relations to string length, and what makes music pleasurable to listen to. In the fourth book Kepler presents a metaphysical basis for this system, along with arguments for why the harmony of the worlds appeals to the intellectual soul in the same manner as the harmony of music appeals to the human soul. Here he also uses the naturalness of this harmony as an argument for [[heliocentrism]]. In book five, Kepler describes in detail the orbital motion of the planets and how this motion nearly perfectly matches musical harmonies. Finally, after a discussion on [[astrology]] in book five, Kepler ends ''Harmonices'' by describing his [[Third law of planetary motion|third law]], which states that for any planet the cube of the semi-major axis of its elliptical orbit is proportional to the square of its orbital period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the final book of ''Harmonices'', Kepler explains how the ratio of the maximum and minimum [[Angular velocity|angular speeds]] of each planet (its speeds at the perihelion and aphelion) is very nearly equivalent to a consonant musical interval. Furthermore, the ratios between these extreme speeds of the planets compared against each other create even more mathematical harmonies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These speeds explain the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of the orbits of the planets in a natural way that appealed to Kepler’s religious beliefs in a heavenly creator.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While Kepler did believe that the harmony of the worlds was inaudible, he related the motions of the planets to musical concepts in book four of ''Harmonices''. He makes an analogy between comparing the extreme speeds of one planet and the extreme speeds of multiple planets with the difference between [[Monophonic music|monophonic]] and [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] music. Because planets with larger eccentricities have a greater variation in speed they produce more “notes.” Earth’s maximum and minimum speeds, for example, are in a ratio of roughly 16 to 15, or that of a semitone, whereas Venus’ orbit is nearly circular, and therefore only produces a singular note. Mars, which has the largest eccentricity, has the largest interval, a minor tenth, or a ratio of 12 to 5. This range, as well as the relative speeds between the planets, led Kepler to conclude that the solar system was comprised of two basses ([[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]]), a tenor ([[Mars]]), two altos ([[Venus]] and [[Earth]]), and a soprano ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]), which had sung in “perfect concord,” at the beginning of time, and could potentially arrange themselves to do so again.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was certain of the link between musical harmonies and the harmonies of the heavens and believed that “man, the imitator of the Creator,” had emulated the polyphony of the heavens so as to enjoy “the continuous duration of the time of the world in a fraction of an hour.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Kepler was so convinced in a creator that he was convinced of the existence of this harmony despite a number of inaccuracies present in ''Harmonices''. Many of the ratios differed by an error greater than simple measurement error from the true value for the interval, and the ratio between Mars’ and Jupiter’s angular velocities does not create a consonant interval, though every other combination of planets does. Kepler brushed aside this problem by making the argument, with the math to support it, that because these [[elliptical]] paths had to fit into the regular solids described in ''Mysterium'' the values for both the dimensions of the solids and the angular speeds would have to differ from the ideal values to compensate. This change also had the benefit of helping Kepler retroactively explain why the regular solids encompassing each planet were slightly imperfect.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Use in recent music==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
The connection between music, mathematics, and astronomy had a profound impact on history. It resulted in music's inclusion in the Quadrivium, the medieval curriculum that included arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy, and along with the Trivium (grammar, logic,and rhetoric) made up the seven liberal arts, which are still the basis for higher education today. A small number of recent compositions either make reference to or are based on the concepts of Musica Universalis or Harmony of the Spheres. Among these are ''[[Music of the Spheres (Mike Oldfield album)|Music of the Spheres]]'' by [[Mike Oldfield]], ''[[Om (The Moody Blues song)|Om]]'' by [[the Moody Blues]], ''[[The Earth Sings Mi Fa Mi]]'' album by [[The Receiving End of Sirens]], ''[[Music of the Spheres (Ian Brown album)|Music of the Spheres]]'' by [[Ian Brown]]'','' and [[Björk]]'s single ''[[Cosmogony (song)|Cosmogony]]'', included in her 2011 album ''[[Biophilia (album)|Biophilia]]''. Earlier, in the 1910s, Danish composer [[Rued Langgaard]] composed a pioneering orchestral work titled ''[[Music of the Spheres (Langgaard)|Music of the Spheres]]''. ''Music of the Spheres'' was also the title chosen for the musical foundation of the video-game [[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]], and was composed by Martin O'Donnell, Michael Salvatori, and Paul McCartney. [[Paul Hindemith]] wrote an Opera (1957), and a Symphony using the same music, called 'Die Harmonie der Welt' based upon the life of the Astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630).

==Reception==
[[Meg-John Barker|Meg Barker]], in a review of ''New Directions in Sex Therapy'', wrote "it gives us a much-needed critique of existing ways of understanding, and working with, sex in the therapy room.", and although having concerns about the lack of a chapter on [[bisexuality]] and the apparent underlying assumption that relationships should be sexual, concluded "I hope that this collection will encourage practitioners to critically consider the assumptions and practices that they may be taking for granted, and to start out in a new alternative direction that is truly transformative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cwhn.ca/en/networkmagazine/newdirectionsinsextherapy?page=show |title=Book Review: New Directions in Sex Therapy: Innovations and Alternatives |author=Meg Barker |website=cwhn.ca |publisher=Canadian Women's Health Network |accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''POISK Centre''' (in [[Russian language|Russian]]:''Центр «ПОИСК»'') is an educational and research organization founded in 2004 at [[Saint Petersburg State University]] ([[Russia]]). Its primary aim is to encourage secondary school students and university students to do independent [[scientific research]].

The POISK Centre supports educational programs that motivate youth to develop an interest in [[physics]] and [[natural sciences]], and to involve them in “what a real scientist does” as early as possible. These activities include tight collaboration with leading universities and secondary schools in Russia and abroad, joint seminars and workshops, regular international scientific conferences, language programs, but also the promotion of research competitions, such as the [[International Young Physicists' Tournament|Young Physicists' Tournament]].

POISK means ‘search’ in [[Russian language|Russian]], but it is also a Russian abbreviation for the Support Centre for Olympiads and Intellectual Competitions.

== Achievements ==

Since 2004, the POISK Centre is the only university-based organization in Russia that is being selecting, supervising and preparing the National team that represents Russia at the [[International Young Physicists' Tournament]].

The POISK Centre’s team has been a participant of [[International Young Physicists' Tournament|IYPTs]] in 2004 ([[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]), 2005 ([[Winterthur]], [[Switzerland]]) and 2006 ([[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]]) with significant success, winning bronze medals twice. In May 2007, the POISK’s Russian team fought in the Finals and won silver at the [[Austrian Young Physicists' Tournament]] held in [[Leoben]], [[Austria]].

In November 2007, the POISK's team of university students was one of the two gold winners at the [[Ukrainian Physicists' Tournament for University Students]] held at the [[Kiev National University]], [[Ukraine]].

The '''Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment, and Security''' is an American non-profit research institute created in 1987 to provide independent research and policy analysis on issues of development, environment, and security, with a particular focus on global and regional freshwater issues. It is located in [[Oakland, California]] (USA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacinst.org |title=Pacific Institute: Research for People and the Planet |publisher=Pacific Institute |accessdate=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==History==
The focus of the Institute is to find solutions to problems like water shortages and contamination, environmental conflicts, global [[climate change]], and [[environmental terrorism]]. The mission of the Institute is to "conduct interdisciplinary research and partner with stakeholders to produce solutions that advance environmental protection, economic development, and social equity—in California, nationally, and internationally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pacinst.org/about_us/index.html |title=About the Pacific Institute |publisher=Pacific Institute |accessdate=July 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109092834/http://www.pacinst.org/about_us/index.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its founding, the institute staff has analyzed scientific and policy issues, published papers, and provided both community and high-level policy workshops and briefings around water, climate, energy, environmental security, globalization, and more, with a special focus on issues in the hydrologic sciences, water management, and water policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seawater Desalination Select Committee on Coastal Protection and Access to Natural Resources|url=http://coastalprotection.assembly.ca.gov/seawaterdesalinationimpacts|website=coastalprotection.assembly.ca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Talks, Panels, and Workshops by Pacific Institute Experts - Pacific Institute|url=http://pacinst.org/media-center/online-updates/talks/|website=Pacific Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=See All Publications|url=http://pacinst.org/publications/see-all-publications/|website=Pacific Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its interdisciplinary approach is applied to resource issues, strategies for community involvement, and [[economic globalization]], and they also address the misuse and abuse of science in the policy context.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the Institute's 2007 testimony on the integrity of science to the U.S. Congress. {{cite web|url=http://www.pacinst.org/publications/testimony/Gleick_Senate_Commerce_2-7-07.pdf |title=Testimony of Dr. Peter Gleick |publisher=Hearing on Climate Change Research and Scientific Integrity |date=February 7, 2007 |accessdate=February 21, 2012 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute has also worked on new thinking around [[sustainable]] [[water resources]] management and use.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, reports in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' [2003] and ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' [2002]: [[Peter Gleick]], "Global Freshwater Resources: Soft-Path Solutions for the 21st Century," State of the Planet, ''Science'' 302 (November 28, 2003): 1524–28. {{Doi|10.1126/science.1089967}}. "Soft Water Paths," ''Nature'' 418 (July 25, 2002): 373.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Institute was awarded the first U.S. Water Prize.

In [[electrical engineering]], the '''power factor''' of an [[alternating current|AC]] electrical power system is defined as the [[ratio]] of the ''[[AC power#Active, reactive, and apparent power|real power]]'' absorbed by the [[electrical load|load]] to the ''apparent power'' flowing in the circuit, and is a [[dimensionless number]] in the [[closed interval]] of −1 to 1. A power factor of less than one indicates the voltage and current are not in phase, reducing the instantaneous [[Product (mathematics)|product]] of the two. [[Power (physics)|Real power]] is the instantaneous product of voltage and current and represents the capacity of the electricity for performing work. Apparent power is the product of average current and voltage. Due to energy stored in the load and returned to the source, or due to a non-linear load that distorts the wave shape of the current drawn from the source, the apparent power may be greater than the real power. A negative power factor occurs when the device (which is normally the load) generates power, which then flows back towards the source.

In an electric power system, a load with a low power factor draws more current than a load with a high power factor for the same amount of useful power transferred. The higher currents increase the energy lost in the distribution system, and require larger wires and other equipment. Because of the costs of larger equipment and wasted energy, electrical utilities will usually charge a higher cost to industrial or commercial customers where there is a low power factor.

'''Power-factor correction''' increases the power factor of a load, improving efficiency for the distribution system to which it is attached. Linear loads with low power factor (such as [[induction motor]]s) can be corrected with a passive network of [[capacitor]]s or [[inductor]]s. Non-linear loads, such as [[rectifier]]s, distort the current drawn from the system. In such cases, active or passive power factor correction may be used to counteract the distortion and raise the power factor. The devices for correction of the power factor may be at a central [[electrical substation|substation]], spread out over a distribution system, or built into power-consuming equipment.

== Linear circuits ==

[[File:Power factor 0.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.36|Instantaneous and average power calculated from AC voltage and current with a zero power factor (&lt;math&gt;\varphi=90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\cos\varphi=0&lt;/math&gt;). The blue line shows all the power is stored temporarily in the load during the first quarter cycle and returned to the grid during the second quarter cycle, so no real power is consumed.]]

[[File:Power factor 0.7.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.36|Instantaneous and average power calculated from AC voltage and current with a lagging power factor (&lt;math&gt;\varphi=45^\circ&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\cos\varphi\approx0.71&lt;/math&gt;). The blue line shows some of the power is returned to the grid during the part of the cycle labeled &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.]]

In a purely resistive AC circuit, voltage and current waveforms are in step (or [[Phase (waves)|in phase]]), changing polarity at the same instant in each cycle. All the power entering the load is consumed (or dissipated).

Where [[Reactance (electronics)|reactive]] loads are present, such as with [[capacitor]]s or [[inductor]]s, energy storage in the loads results in a phase difference between the current and voltage waveforms. During each cycle of the AC voltage, extra energy, in addition to any energy consumed in the load, is temporarily stored in the load in [[Electric field|electric]] or [[magnetic field]]s, and then returned to the power grid a fraction of the period later.

Because [[high voltage]] alternating current distribution systems are essentially quasi-linear circuit systems subject to continuous daily variation, there is a continuous "ebb and flow" of nonproductive power. Non productive power increases the current in the line, potentially to the point of failure.

Thus, a circuit with a low power factor will use higher currents to transfer a given quantity of real power than a circuit with a high power factor. A linear load does not change the shape of the waveform of the current, but may change the relative timing (phase) between voltage and current.

Electrical circuits containing dominantly resistive loads (incandescent lamps, heating elements) have a power factor of almost 1.0, but circuits containing inductive or capacitive loads (electric motors, [[solenoid]] valves, transformers, [[Electrical ballast|fluorescent lamp ballasts]], and others) can have a power factor well below 1.

=== Definition and calculation ===
[[AC power]] flow has two components:
* Real power or active power (&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;) (sometimes called average power&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introductory Circuit Analysis|last=Boylestad|first=Robert|publisher=|isbn=978-0-13-097417-4|edition=10th|location=|date=2002-03-04|pages=857}}&lt;/ref&gt;), expressed in [[watt]]s (W)
* Reactive power (&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;), usually expressed in [[volt-ampere reactive|reactive volt-amperes]] (var)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SI Units – Electricity and Magnetism |publisher = International Electrotechnical Commission |url=http://www.iec.ch/zone/si/si_elecmag.htm | place = [[Switzerland|CH]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071211234311/http://www.iec.ch/zone/si/si_elecmag.htm#si_epo |archivedate = 2007-12-11 |access-date= 14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are combined to the complex power (&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;) expressed [[volt-amperes]] (VA). The magnitude of the complex power is the apparent power (&lt;math&gt;|S|&lt;/math&gt;), also expressed in volt-amperes (VA).

The VA and var are non-SI units mathematically identical to the watt, but are used in engineering practice instead of the watt to state what [[physical quantity|quantity]] is being expressed. The [[SI]] explicitly disallows using units for this purpose or as the only source of information about a physical quantity as used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The International System of Units (SI) [SI brochure]|url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf|year=2006|publisher=[[BIPM]]|location=§&amp;nbsp;5.3.2 (p.&amp;nbsp;132, 40 in the [[PDF]] file)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power factor is defined as the ratio of real power to apparent power. As power is transferred along a transmission line, it does not consist purely of real power that can do work once transferred to the load, but rather consists of a combination of real and reactive power, called apparent power. The power factor describes the amount of real power transmitted along a transmission line relative to the total apparent power flowing in the line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] | id = Std. 100 | title = Authoritative Dictionary of Standards Terms | edition = 7th | isbn = 978-0-7381-2601-2| year = 2000 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = IEEE | id = Std. 1459–2000 | title = Trial-Use Standard Definitions for the Measurement of Electric Power Quantities Under Sinusoidal, Nonsinusoidal, Balanced, or Unbalanced Conditions | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-7381-1963-2}}.  Note 1, section 3.1.1.1, when defining the quantities for power factor, asserts that real power only flows to the load and can never be negative. As of 2013, one of the authors acknowledged that this note was incorrect, and is being revised for the next edition. See http://powerstandards.com/Shymanski/draft.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Power triangle ====
[[File:Power triangle diagram.jpg|frameless|upright=1.68]]

One can relate the various components of AC power by using the power triangle in vector space. Real power extends horizontally in the î direction as it represents a purely real component of AC power. Reactive power extends in the direction of ĵ as it represents a purely imaginary component of AC power. Complex power (and its magnitude, Apparent power) represents a combination of both real and reactive power, and therefore can be calculated by using the vector sum of these two components. We can conclude that the mathematical relationship between these components is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
                               S &amp;= P + jQ \\
                               |S|^2 &amp;= P^2 + Q^2 \\[3pt]
                               |S| &amp;= \sqrt{P^2 + Q^2} \\
  \cos\theta\text{, power factor} &amp;= \frac{P\text{, real power}}{|S|\text{, apparent power}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Increasing the power factor ====
[[File:Increased power factor.jpg|frameless|upright=1.8]]

As the power factor (i.e. cos ''θ'') increases, the ratio of real power to apparent power (which = cos ''θ''), increases and approaches unity (1), while the angle ''θ'' decreases and the reactive power decreases. [As cos ''θ'' → 1, its maximum possible value, ''θ'' → 0 and so Q → 0, as the load becomes less reactive and more purely resistive].

==== Decreasing the power factor ====
[[File:Decreased power factor.jpg|frameless|upright=1.85]]

As the power factor decreases, the ratio of real power to apparent power also decreases, as the angle θ increases and reactive power increases.

==== Lagging and leading power factors ====
There is also a difference between a lagging and leading power factor. The terms refer to whether the phase of the current is leading or lagging the phase of the voltage. A lagging power factor signifies that the load is inductive, as the load will “consume” reactive power, and therefore the reactive component &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is positive as reactive power travels through the circuit and is “consumed” by the inductive load. A leading power factor signifies that the load is capacitive, as the load “supplies” reactive power, and therefore the reactive component &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is negative as reactive power is being supplied to the circuit.

[[File:Lagging-Leading.jpg|frameless|upright=2.66]]

If θ is the [[phase angle]] between the current and voltage, then the power factor is equal to the [[Trigonometric functions|cosine]] of the angle, &lt;math&gt;\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;|P| = |S| \cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;

Since the units are consistent, the power factor is by definition a [[dimensionless number]] between −1 and 1. When power factor is equal to 0, the energy flow is entirely reactive and stored energy in the load returns to the source on each cycle. When the power factor is 1, all the energy supplied by the source is consumed by the load. Power factors are usually stated as "leading" or "lagging" to show the sign of the phase angle. Capacitive loads are leading (current leads voltage), and inductive loads are lagging (current lags voltage).

If a purely resistive load is connected to a power supply, current and voltage will change polarity in step, the power factor will be 1, and the electrical energy flows in a single direction across the network in each cycle. Inductive loads such as induction motors (any type of wound coil) consume reactive power with current waveform lagging the voltage. Capacitive loads such as capacitor banks or buried cable generate reactive power with current phase leading the voltage. Both types of loads will absorb energy during part of the AC cycle, which is stored in the device's magnetic or electric field, only to return this energy back to the source during the rest of the cycle.

For example, to get 1&amp;nbsp;kW of real power, if the power factor is unity, 1&amp;nbsp;kVA of apparent power needs to be transferred (1&amp;nbsp;kW ÷ 1 = 1&amp;nbsp;kVA). At low values of power factor, more apparent power needs to be transferred to get the same real power. To get 1&amp;nbsp;kW of real power at 0.2 power factor, 5&amp;nbsp;kVA of apparent power needs to be transferred (1&amp;nbsp;kW ÷ 0.2 = 5&amp;nbsp;kVA). This apparent power must be produced and transmitted to the load, and is subject to the losses in the production and transmission processes.

Electrical loads consuming [[AC power|alternating current power]] consume both real power and reactive power. The vector sum of real and reactive power is the apparent power. The presence of reactive power causes the real power to be less than the apparent power, and so, the electric load has a power factor of less than 1.

A negative power factor (0 to −1) can result from returning power to the source, such as in the case of a building fitted with solar panels when surplus power is fed back into the supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = On the resistance and electromotive forces of the electric arc |first=W. | last = Duddell | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=203 |issue=359–371 |doi=10.1098/rsta.1904.0022  | pages = 512–15 | year = 1901 | quote = The fact that the solid arc has, at low frequencies, a negative power factor, indicates that the arc is supplying power to the alternator…}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Analysis of some measurement issues in bushing power factor tests in the field |first=S. |last=Zhang |journal= IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery|volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=1350–56 |date=July 2006 |quote=…(the measurement) gives both negative power factor and negative resistive current (power loss) |doi=10.1109/tpwrd.2006.874616}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Performance of Grid-Connected Induction Generator under Naturally Commutated AC Voltage Controller |first=A.

=== Power factor correction of linear loads ===
A high power factor is generally desirable in a power delivery system to reduce losses and improve voltage regulation at the load. Compensating elements near an electrical load will reduce the apparent power demand on the supply system. Power factor correction may be applied by an [[electric power transmission]] utility to improve the stability and efficiency of the network. Individual electrical customers who are charged by their utility for low power factor may install correction equipment to increase their power factor so as to reduce costs.

Power factor correction brings the power factor of an AC power circuit closer to 1 by supplying or absorbing reactive power, adding capacitors or inductors that act to cancel the inductive or capacitive effects of the load, respectively. In the case of offsetting the inductive effect of motor loads, capacitors can be locally connected. These capacitors help to generate reactive power to meet the demand of the inductive loads. This will keep that reactive power from having to flow all the way from the utility generator to the load. In the electricity industry, inductors are said to consume reactive power and capacitors are said to supply it, even though reactive power is just energy moving back and forth on each AC cycle.

The reactive elements in power factor correction devices can create voltage fluctuations and harmonic noise when switched on or off. They will supply or sink reactive power regardless of whether there is a corresponding load operating nearby, increasing the system's no-load losses. In the worst case, reactive elements can interact with the system and with each other to create resonant conditions, resulting in system instability and severe [[overvoltage]] fluctuations. As such, reactive elements cannot simply be applied without engineering analysis.

[[File:Condensatorenbatterij.jpg|right|thumb|1. [[Reactive Power Control Relay]]; 2. Network connection points; 3. [[Fuse (electrical)|Slow-blow Fuses]]; 4. Inrush Limiting [[Contactor]]s; 5. [[Capacitor]]s (single-phase or three-phase units, delta-connection); 6. [[Transformer]] (for controls and ventilation fans) ]]

An '''automatic power factor correction unit''' consists of a number of [[capacitor]]s that are switched by means of [[contactor]]s. These contactors are controlled by a regulator that measures power factor in an electrical network. Depending on the load and power factor of the network, the power factor controller will switch the necessary blocks of capacitors in steps to make sure the power factor stays above a selected value.

Instead of using a set of switched [[capacitor]]s, an unloaded [[synchronous motor]] can supply reactive power. The [[reactive power]] drawn by the synchronous motor is a function of its field excitation. This is referred to as a '''[[synchronous condenser]]'''. It is started and connected to the [[electrical network]]. It operates at a leading power factor and puts [[volt-ampere reactive|vars]] onto the network as required to support a system's [[voltage]] or to maintain the system power factor at a specified level.

The synchronous condenser's installation and operation are identical to large [[electric motor]]s. Its principal advantage is the ease with which the amount of correction can be adjusted; it behaves like a variable capacitor. Unlike capacitors, the amount of reactive power supplied is proportional to voltage, not the square of voltage; this improves voltage stability on large networks.  Synchronous condensers are often used in connection with [[High-voltage direct current|high-voltage direct-current]] transmission projects or in large industrial plants such as [[steel mill]]s.

For power factor correction of high-voltage power systems or large, fluctuating industrial loads, power electronic devices such as the [[Static VAR compensator]] or [[STATCOM]] are increasingly used. These systems are able to compensate sudden changes of power factor much more rapidly than contactor-switched capacitor banks, and being solid-state require less maintenance than synchronous condensers.

== Non-linear loads ==
Examples of non-linear loads on a power system are rectifiers (such as used in a power supply), and arc discharge devices such as [[fluorescent lamp]]s, electric [[welding]] machines, or [[arc furnace]]s. Because current in these systems is interrupted by a switching action, the current contains frequency components that are multiples of the power system frequency. Distortion power factor is a measure of how much the harmonic distortion of a load current decreases the average power transferred to the load.
[[File:Power factor 75 2.png|right|thumb|upright=1.36|Sinusoidal voltage and non-sinusoidal current give a distortion power factor of 0.75 for this computer power supply load.]]

=== Non-sinusoidal components ===
In linear circuits having only sinusoidal currents and voltages of one frequency, the power factor arises only from the difference in phase between the current and voltage. This is "displacement power factor".&lt;ref name="FuchsMasoum2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ewald Fuchs|author2=Mohammad A. S. Masoum|title=Power Quality in Power Systems and Electrical Machines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wuGcBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA432|date=14 July 2015|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0-12-800988-8|pages=432–|quote=The DPF it the cosine of the angle between these two quantities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-linear loads change the shape of the current waveform from a [[sine wave]] to some other form. Non-linear loads create [[harmonic]] currents in addition to the original (fundamental frequency) AC current. This is of importance in practical power systems that contain [[non-linear]] loads such as [[rectifiers]], some forms of electric lighting, [[electric arc furnace]]s, welding equipment, [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]], variable speed drives and other devices. Filters consisting of linear capacitors and inductors can prevent harmonic currents from entering the supplying system.

To measure the real power or reactive power, a [[wattmeter]] designed to work properly with non-sinusoidal currents must be used.

=== Distortion power factor ===
The ''distortion power factor'' is the distortion component associated with the harmonic voltages and currents present in the system.
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mbox{distortion power factor}
&amp; = \frac{ I_1}{I_{rms}} \\
&amp; = \frac{I_1} {\sqrt{I_1^2+I_2^2+I_3^2+I_4^2+\cdots}} \\
&amp; = \frac{1} { \sqrt{1+ \frac{I_2^2+I_3^2+I_4^2+\cdots}{I_1^2}}} \\
&amp; = \frac{1} {\sqrt{ 1+THD_i^2}} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\mbox{THD}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[total harmonic distortion]] of the load current. 
:&lt;math&gt;THD_i = \frac{\sqrt{\displaystyle\sum_{h=2}^\infty I_h^2}} {I_1}= \frac{\sqrt{I_2^2+I_3^2+I_4^2+\cdots}} {I_1}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt; is the fundamental component of the current and &lt;math&gt;I_{\mbox{rms}}&lt;/math&gt; is the total current – both are [[root mean square]]-values (distortion power factor can also be used to describe individual order harmonics, using the corresponding current in place of total current). This definition with respect to total harmonic distortion assumes that the voltage stays undistorted (sinusoidal, without harmonics). This simplification is often a good approximation for stiff voltage sources (not being affected by changes in load downstream in the distribution network). Total harmonic distortion of typical generators from current distortion in the network is on the order of 1–2%, which can have larger scale implications but can be ignored in common practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://ecmweb.com/power-quality/effects-harmonics-power-systems |title=Effects of Harmonics on Power Systems |first=C. |last=Sankaran |year=1999 |publisher=Electro-Test |quote=...and voltage-time relationship deviates from the pure sine function. The distortion at the point of generation is very small (about 1% to 2%), but nonetheless it exists.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result when multiplied with the displacement power factor (DPF) is the overall, true power factor or just power factor (PF):
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{PF} = \frac{\cos{\varphi}} {\sqrt{ 1+THD_i^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Distortion in three-phase networks ===
In practice, the local effects of distortion current on devices in a [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase distribution network]] rely on the magnitude of certain order harmonics rather than the total harmonic distortion.

For example, the triplen, or zero-sequence, harmonics (3rd, 9th, 15th, etc.) have the property of being in-phase when compared line-to-line. In a [[delta-wye transformer]], these harmonics can result in circulating currents in the delta windings and result in greater [[Joule heating|resistive heating]]. In a wye-configuration of a transformer, triplen harmonics will not create these currents, but they will result in a non-zero current in the [[Ground and neutral|neutral wire]]. This could overload the neutral wire in some cases
and create error in kilowatt-hour metering systems and billing revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.pge.com/includes/docs/pdfs/mybusiness/customerservice/energystatus/powerquality/harmonics.pdf | title = Power System Harmonics | publisher = Pacific Gas and Electric | chapter = Single-phase load harmonics vs. three-phase load harmonics | format = [[PDF]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://energylogix.ca/harmonics_and_ieee.pdf | title = Harmonics and IEEE 519 | publisher = EnergyLogix Solutions | chapter = Harmonic Effects | place = [[Canada|CA]] | format = [[PDF]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence of current harmonics in a transformer also result in larger [[eddy currents]] in the magnetic core of the transformer. Eddy current losses generally increase as the square of the frequency, lowering the transformer's efficiency, dissipating additional heat, and reducing its service life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://ecmweb.com/power-quality/effects-harmonics-power-systems |title=Effects of Harmonics on Power Systems |first=C. |last=Sankaran |year=1999 |publisher = Electro-Test |section=Transformers}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative-sequence harmonics (5th, 11th, 17th, etc.) combine 120 degrees out of phase, similarly to the fundamental harmonic but in a reversed sequence.  In generators and motors, these currents produce magnetic fields which oppose the rotation of the shaft and sometimes result in damaging mechanical vibrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://ecmweb.com/power-quality/effects-harmonics-power-systems |title=Effects of Harmonics on Power Systems |first=C. |last=Sankaran |year=1999 |publisher=Electro-Test |section=Motors |quote=The interaction between the positive and negative sequence magnetic fields and currents produces torsional oscillations of the motor shaft. These oscillations result in shaft vibrations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switched-mode power supplies ===
{{Main|switched-mode power supply#Power factor}}
A particularly important class of non-linear loads is the millions of personal computers that typically incorporate [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]] (SMPS) with rated output power ranging from a few watts to more than 1&amp;nbsp;kW. Historically, these very-low-cost power supplies incorporated a simple full-wave rectifier that conducted only when the [[Mains electricity|mains]] instantaneous voltage exceeded the voltage on the input capacitors.  This leads to very high [[peak-to-average ratio|ratios of peak-to-average]] input current, which also lead to a low distortion power factor and potentially serious phase and neutral loading concerns.

A typical switched-mode power supply first converts the AC mains to a DC bus by means of a [[bridge rectifier]] or a similar circuit. The output voltage is then derived from this DC bus. The problem with this is that the [[rectifier]] is a non-linear device, so the input current is highly non-linear. That means that the input current has energy at [[harmonic]]s of the frequency of the voltage.

This presents a particular problem for the power companies, because they cannot compensate for the harmonic current by adding simple capacitors or inductors, as they could for the reactive power drawn by a linear load. Many jurisdictions are beginning to legally require power factor correction for all power supplies above a certain power level.

Regulatory agencies such as the [[European Union|EU]] have set harmonic limits as a method of improving power factor. Declining component cost has hastened implementation of two different methods. To comply with current EU standard EN61000-3-2, all switched-mode power supplies with output power more than 75&amp;nbsp;W must include passive power factor correction, at least. [[80 Plus]] power supply certification requires a power factor of 0.9 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.80plus.org/ | publisher = 80 Plus | title = Certified Power Supplies and Manufacturers | section = What is an 80 PLUS certified power supply?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power factor correction (PFC) in non-linear loads ===

==== Passive PFC ====
The simplest way to control the [[Harmonics (electrical power)|harmonic]] current is to use a [[electronic filter|filter]] that passes current only at [[utility frequency|line frequency]] (50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz). The filter consists of capacitors or inductors, and makes a non-linear device look more like a [[linear]] load. An example of passive PFC is a [[valley-fill circuit]].

A disadvantage of passive PFC is that it requires larger inductors or capacitors than an equivalent power active PFC circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.nuvation.com/corporate/news/newsletter/fall2006/powersupply.html |publisher=Nuvation |date=Fall 2006 |title=Power Supply Design Principles: Techniques and Solutions, Part 3 |newspaper=Newsletter |first=Ben |last=Schramm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309134617/http://www.nuvation.com/corporate/news/newsletter/fall2006/powersupply.html |archivedate=2007-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = Xplore | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1187344 | title = Quasi-active power factor correction with a variable inductive filter: theory, design and practice | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 248–255 | publisher = IEEE| doi = 10.1109/TPEL.2002.807135 | year = 2003 | last1 = Wolfle | first1 = W.H. | last2 = Hurley | first2 = W.G. }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher=Nuigalway |type=project |url=http://www.nuigalway.ie/power_electronics/projects/quasi_active.html |place=[[Ireland|IE]] |title=Power electronics |contribution=Quasi-active Power Factor Correction: The Role of Variable Inductance |last1=Wölfle |first1=W.

==== Active PFC ====
[[File:Active pfc PSU packaging.png|right|thumb|Specifications taken from the packaging of a 610 W [[Power supply unit (computer)|PC power supply]] showing active PFC rating]]

Active PFC is the use of [[power electronics]] to change the waveform of current drawn by a load to improve the power factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Fairchild Semiconductor | year = 2004 | type = application note | number = 42047 | title = Power Factor Correction (PFC) Basics | url = http://www.fairchildsemi.com/an/AN/AN-42047.pdf | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some types of the active PFC are [[Buck converter|buck]], [[Boost converter|boost]], [[Buck-boost converter|buck-boost]] and [[synchronous condenser]].  Active power factor correction can be single-stage or multi-stage.

In the case of a switched-mode power supply, a [[boost converter]] is inserted between the bridge rectifier and the main input capacitors. The boost converter attempts to maintain a constant DC bus voltage on its output while drawing a current that is always in phase with and at the same frequency as the line voltage. Another switched-mode converter inside the power supply produces the desired output voltage from the DC bus. This approach requires additional semiconductor switches and control electronics, but permits cheaper and smaller passive components. It is frequently used in practice.

For a three-phase SMPS, the [[Vienna rectifier]] configuration may be used to substantially improve the power factor.

[[Switched-mode power supply|SMPSs]] with passive PFC can achieve power factor of about 0.7–0.75, SMPSs with active PFC, up to 0.99 power factor, while a SMPS without any power factor correction have a power factor of only about 0.55–0.65.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Sugawara |first1=I. |last2=Suzuki |first2=Y. |last3=Takeuchi |first3=A. |last4=Teshima |first4=T. |contribution=Experimental studies on active and passive PFC circuits |title=INTELEC 97, 19th International Telecommunications Energy Conference |date=19–23 Oct 1997 |pages=571–78 |doi=10.1109/INTLEC.1997.646051|isbn=978-0-7803-3996-5 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their very wide input voltage range, many power supplies with active PFC can automatically adjust to operate on AC power from about 100&amp;nbsp;V (Japan) to 240&amp;nbsp;V (Europe). That feature is particularly welcome in power supplies for laptops.

==== Dynamic PFC ====
Dynamic power factor correction (DPFC), sometimes referred to as "real-time power factor correction," is used for electrical stabilization in cases of rapid load changes (e.g. at large manufacturing sites). DPFC is useful when standard power factor correction would cause over or under correction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Chavez |first=C. |last2=Houdek |first2=J. A. |title=Dynamic Harmonic Mitigation and power factor correction |journal=IEE |date=9–11 Oct 2007|volume=Electrical Power Quality |pages=1–5 |doi=10.1109/EPQU.2007.4424144 |isbn=978-84-690-9441-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  DPFC uses semiconductor switches, typically [[thyristor]]s, to quickly connect and disconnect capacitors or inductors to improve power factor.

== Importance of power factor in distribution systems ==
[[File:Condensor bank 150kV - 75MVAR.jpg|thumb|upright|75 Mvar capacitor bank in a 150 kV substation]]
Power factors below 1.0 require a utility to generate more than the minimum volt-amperes necessary to supply the real power (watts). This increases generation and transmission costs. For example, if the load power factor were as low as 0.7, the apparent power would be 1.4 times the real power used by the load. Line current in the circuit would also be 1.4 times the current required at 1.0 power factor, so the losses in the circuit would be doubled (since they are proportional to the square of the current). Alternatively, all components of the system such as generators, conductors, transformers, and switchgear would be increased in size (and cost) to carry the extra current. When the power factor is close to unity, for the same KVA rating of the transformer more load can be connected&lt;ref&gt;https://www.electricalclassroom.com/power-factor/&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Utilities typically charge additional costs to commercial customers who have a power factor below some limit, which is typically 0.9 to 0.95.  Engineers are often interested in the power factor of a load as one of the factors that affect the efficiency of power transmission.

With the rising cost of energy and concerns over the efficient delivery of power, active PFC has become more common in consumer electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = ON Semiconductor | year = 2007 | title = Power Factor Correction Handbook | url = http://www.onsemi.com/pub_link/Collateral/HBD853-D.PDF | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Current [[Energy Star]] guidelines for computers&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | format = PDF | place = US | url = http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/prod_development/revisions/downloads/computer/Version5.0_Computer_Spec.pdf | publisher = Energy Star | title = Program Requirements for Computers | edition = Version 5.0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; call for a power factor of ≥ 0.9 at 100% of rated output in the [[Power supply unit (computer)|PC's power supply]]. According to a white paper authored by Intel and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], PCs with internal power supplies will require the use of active power factor correction to meet the ENERGY STAR 5.0 Program Requirements for Computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Bolioli |first1=T. |last2=Duggirala |first2=M. |last3=Haines |first3=E. |last4=Kolappan |first4=R. |last5=Wong |first5=H. |year=2009 |publisher=Energy Star |title=Version 5.0 System Implementation |type=white paper |format=PDF |url=http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/product_specs/program_reqs/Computers_Intel_Whitepaper_Spec5.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, [[IEC EN 61000-3-2|EN 61000-3-2]] requires power factor correction be incorporated into consumer products.

Small customers, such as households, are not usually charged for reactive power and so power factor metering equipment for such customers will not be installed.

== Techniques for measuring the power factor ==

The power factor in a single-phase circuit (or balanced three-phase circuit) can be measured with the wattmeter-ammeter-voltmeter method, where the power in watts is divided by the product of measured voltage and current. The power factor of a balanced polyphase circuit is the same as that of any phase. The power factor of an unbalanced poly phase circuit is not uniquely defined.

A direct reading power factor meter can be made with a [[moving coil meter]] of the electrodynamic type, carrying two perpendicular coils on the moving part of the instrument. The field of the instrument is energized by the circuit current flow. The two moving coils, A and B, are connected in parallel with the circuit load.  One coil, A, will be connected through a resistor and the second coil, B, through an inductor, so that the current in coil B is delayed with respect to current in A. At unity power factor, the current in A is in phase with the circuit current, and coil A provides maximum torque, driving the instrument pointer toward the 1.0 mark on the scale. At zero power factor, the current in coil B is in phase with circuit current, and coil B provides torque to drive the pointer towards 0. At intermediate values of power factor, the torques provided by the two coils add and the pointer takes up intermediate positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first1=Donald G. |last1=Fink |author1-link=Donald G. Fink |first2=H. Wayne |last2=Beaty |title=Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers |edition=11 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |place=New York |year=1978 |isbn=978-0-07-020974-9 |page=3‐29 paragraph 80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another electromechanical instrument is the polarized-vane type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Manual of Electric Instruments Construction and Operating Principles |id=GET-1087A |publisher=General Electric, Meter and Instrument Department |place=Schenectady, New York |year=1949 |pages=66–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this instrument a stationary field coil produces a rotating magnetic field, just like a polyphase motor. The field coils are connected either directly to polyphase voltage sources or to a phase-shifting reactor if a single-phase application.  A second stationary field coil, perpendicular to the voltage coils, carries a current proportional to current in one phase of the circuit. The moving system of the instrument consists of two vanes that are magnetized by the current coil. In operation the moving vanes take up a physical angle equivalent to the electrical angle between the voltage source and the current source. This type of instrument can be made to register for currents in both directions, giving a four-quadrant display of power factor or phase angle.

Digital instruments exist that directly measure the time lag between voltage and current waveforms. Low-cost instruments of this type measure the peak of the waveforms. More sophisticated versions measure the peak of the fundamental harmonic only, thus giving a more accurate reading for phase angle on distorted waveforms. Calculating power factor from voltage and current phases is only accurate if both waveforms are sinusoidal.&lt;ref name=ni_white_paper&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ni.com/white-paper/4278/en/|title=The Fundamentals of FFT-Based Signal Analysis and Measurement in LabVIEW and LabWindows/CVI|work=National Instruments Corporation|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mnemonics ==
English-language power engineering students are advised to remember:
"ELI the ICE man" or "ELI on ICE" – the voltage E leads the current I in an inductor L; the current leads the voltage in a capacitor C.

Another common mnemonic is CIVIL – in a capacitor (C) the current (I) leads voltage (V), voltage (V) leads current (I) in an inductor (L).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7306">'''Process art''' is an [[artistic movement]] as well as a creative sentiment where the end product of ''art'' and ''craft'', the ''[[:wikt:objet d’art|objet d’art]]'' ([[work of art]]/[[found object]]), is not the principal focus. The 'process' in process art refers to the process of the formation of art: the gathering, sorting, collating, associating, patterning, and moreover the initiation of actions and proceedings.  Process art is concerned with the actual ''doing'' and how actions can be defined as an actual work of art; seeing the art as pure human expression. Process art often [[logical consequence|entails]] an inherent motivation, rationale, and [[intentionality]]. Therefore, art is viewed as a creative journey or process, rather than as a deliverable or end product.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Movement==
Process art has been entitled as a creative movement in the US and Europe in the mid-1960s. It has roots in Performance Art, the [[Dada]] movement and, more traditionally, the drip paintings of [[Jackson Pollock]], and in its employment of [[serendipity]]. Change and transience are marked themes in the process art movement. The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] states that [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]] in 1968 had a groundbreaking exhibition and essay defining the movement and the Museum Website states:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Process Artists were involved in issues attendant to the body, random occurrences, [[improvisation]], and the liberating qualities of nontraditional materials such as wax, felt, and latex. Using these, they created eccentric forms in erratic or irregular arrangements produced by actions such as cutting, hanging, and dropping, or organic processes such as growth, condensation, freezing, or decomposition.&lt;ref&gt;Source:  {{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200906/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} (accessed: Thursday, March 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; The ephemeral nature and insubstantiality of materials was often showcased and highlighted, as is demonstrated in this review of [[William Basinski]] and his work titled ''The Disintegration Loops I-IV'' by Joe Tangari for [[Pitchfork Media]]: &lt;blockquote&gt; You are slowly being destroyed. It's imperceptible in the scheme of a day or a week or even a year, but you are aging, and your body is degrading. As your cells synthesize the very proteins that allow you to live, they also release free radicals, oxidants that literally perforate your tissue and cause you to grow progressively less able to perform as you did at your peak. By the time you reach 80, you will literally be full of holes, and though you'll never notice a single one of them, you will inevitably feel their collective effect. Aging and degradation are forces of nature, functions of living, and understanding them can be as terrifying as it is gratifying.

It's not the kind of thing you can say often, but I think William Basinski's ''Disintegration Loops'' are a step toward that understanding-- the music itself is not so much composed as it is this force of nature, this inevitable decay of all things, from memory to physical matter, made manifest in music. During the summer of 2001, [[William Basinski]] set about transferring a series of 20-year-old tape loops he'd had in storage to a digital file format, and was startled when this act of preservation began to devour the tapes he was saving. As they played, flakes of magnetic material were scraped away by the reader head, wiping out portions of the music and changing the character and sound of the loops as they progressed, the recording process playing an inadvertent witness to the destruction of Basinski's old music.

In essence, Basinski is improvising using nothing so much as the passage of time as his instrument, and the result is the most amazing piece of processmusic I've ever heard, an encompassing soundworld as lulling as it is apocalyptic.&lt;ref&gt;Source: http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/577-the-disintegration-loops-i-iv/ (accessed: Saturday, February 16, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The process art movement and the [[environmental art]] movement are directly related:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Process Artists engage the primacy of organic systems, using perishable, insubstantial, and transitory materials such as dead rabbits, steam, fat, ice, cereal, sawdust, and grass. The materials are often left exposed to natural forces: gravity, time, weather, temperature, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Source: http://www.artandculture.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/ACLive.woa/wa/movement?id=1037  (accessed:  Thursday, March 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In process art, as in the [[Arte Povera]] movement, nature itself is lauded as art; the symbolization and representation of nature, often rejected.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

===Antecedent===
The process art movement has precedent in indigenous rites, shamanic and religious rituals, cultural forms such as [[sandpainting]], [[sun dance]], and the [[tea ceremony]] are fundamentally related pursuits.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Aspects of the process of the construction of a [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhist]] sand [[mandala]] (a [[subset]] of sandpainting) of [[Medicine Buddha]] by monks from [[Namgyal Monastery]] in Ithaca, New York that began February 26, 2001 and concluded March 21, 2001 has been captured and web-exhibited&lt;ref&gt;Source:  http://www.ackland.org/art/exhibitions/buddhistart/construction.htm (accessed: Monday, December 22, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; by the Ackland's Yager Gallery of Asian Art. The dissolution of the mandala was on June 8, 2001.

===Relationship to other disciplines and movements===
Process art shares fundamental features with a number of other fields, including the [[Expressive therapies | expressive therapies]] and [[Transformative arts| transformative arts]], both of which pivot around how the creative process of engaging in artistic activities can precipitate personal [[Introspection | insight]], individual healing, and [[Social change | social change]], independent of the perceived value attributed to the obejct of creation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Additionally, process art is integral to [[Arts-based research| arts-based research]], which uses creative process and artistic expression to investigate subjects that resist description or representation through other modes of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Barone, T. and Eisner, E., Arts Based Research.

'''Sonido 13''' is a theory of [[microtonal music]] created by the [[Mexican people|Mexican]] composer [[Julián Carrillo]] around 1900&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;Randel, Don Michael, ed. (1996). "Carrillo (Trujillo), Julián (Antonio)", ''The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music'', p.138. {{ISBN|0-674-37299-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and described by [[Nicolas Slonimsky]] as "the field of sounds smaller than the twelve [[semitone]]s of the [[chromatic scale|tempered scale]]."&lt;ref&gt;Slonimsky, Nicolas (1945). ''Music of Latin America'', p.229. 1972 {{ISBN|9780306711886}}. Cited in Bethell (1998), p.95.&lt;/ref&gt; Carrillo developed this theory in 1895&lt;ref&gt;Malmström, Dan (1974). ''Introduction to Twentieth Century Mexican Music'', p.34-36. {{ISBN|91-7222-050-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while he was experimenting with his [[violin]]. As he placed his finger over a violin string, he noticed that he could produce different sounds than the ones defined by musical convention. This way, he realized that the string could be divided into an infinite number of [[pitch (music)|pitches]], creating many more possibilities for [[musical composition|music composition]]. Though he became internationally recognized for his system of [[musical notation|notation]], it was never widely applied.&lt;ref name="Cultural"/&gt; His first composition in demonstration of his theories was ''[[Preludio a Colón]]'' (1922).&lt;ref name="Cultural"/&gt;

The Western musical convention up to this day divides an [[octave]] into twelve different pitches that can be arranged or [[Musical temperament|tempered]] in different [[Interval (music)|intervals]]. Carrillo termed his new system Sonido 13, which is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Thirteenth Sound" or Sound 13, because it enabled musicians to go beyond the twelve notes that comprise an octave in conventional [[Classical music|Western music]].

==History==

===Early life===

Julián Carrillo was a native of the state of [[San Luis Potosí]] in [[Mexico]]. He attended the [[National Conservatory of Music (Mexico)|National Conservatory of Music]] in [[Mexico City]], where he studied Violin, Composition, [[Physics]], [[Acoustics]], and [[Mathematics]]. The laws that define music intervals instantly amazed Carrillo, which led him to conduct experiments on his violin. He began analyzing the way the pitch of a string changed depending on the finger position, concluding that there had to be a way to split the string into an infinite number of parts. One day, Carrillo was able to divide the fourth string of his violin with a [[razor]] into 16 parts in the interval between the notes G and A, thus creating 16 unique sounds. This event was the beginning of Sonido 13 that led Carrillo to study more about physics and the nature of intervals.

===Professional life===

Carrillo became an excellent musician at the Conservatory and received a scholarship to study in Leipzig Royal Conservatory. After Carrillo returned to Mexico in 1918, he became [[Conducting|conductor]] of the National Symphony Orchestra and in 1920 he also became [[Principal (school)|Principal]] of the National Conservatory of Music. It was during this time that he began to invest a significant amount of time on Sonido 13. His achievements in this area were extensive and consisted of writing over 20 books, making more than 40 compositions, patenting fifteen pianos capable of producing small intervals, and organizing the Sonido 13 Symphonic Orchestra that performed in different parts of the world, playing microtonal music composed by Carrillo in different intervals. In 1933, Ahualulco, the town where Julián Carrillo was born, was renamed to Ahualulco del Sonido 13 in honor of Carrillo's work.

Carrillo was, "closely associated with the [[Díaz regime]]," and preferred [[Neoclassicism (music)|neo-classicism]] to [[Musical nationalism|nationalism]].&lt;ref name="Cultural"&gt;Bethell, Leslie, ed. (1998). ''A Cultural History of Latin America: Literature, Music and the Visual Arts in the 19th and 20th Centuries'', p.95. {{ISBN|0-521-62626-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music theory==

===Introduction===

Julián Carrillo was a pioneer of microtonal music in the Western world. Julián Carrillo started dividing [[Major second|whole tones (major seconds)]] into 16 intervals, but he did not stop there. Through experiments, Carrillo noticed that he could divide the string into an infinite number of intervals, or into as many intervals as it is physically possible. Carrillo created intervals of 3 ({{audio|Third-tone on C.mid|Play}}), 4 ({{audio|Quarter tone on C.mid|Play}}), 5 ({{audio|Fifth-tone on C.mid|Play}}), 16 ({{audio|Sixteenth-tone on C.mid|Play}}), 32 ({{audio|Thirty-second tone on C.mid|Play}}), 64 ({{audio|Sixty-fourth tone on C.mid|Play}}), and 128 ({{audio|One-hundred and twenty-eighth tone on C.mid|Play}}) tones within a major second&lt;!--18, 24, 30, 96, 192, 384, 768 tone equal temperaments--&gt;, leaving the formula to create more, if desired. However, as the number of intervals increases it becomes harder to distinguish the notes from each other (see [[just noticeable difference]]).

===Music notation===

Because new sets of sounds were created, it was imperative to make a new notation system. Carrillo developed an easy method for notation, which would help people not familiar with previous forms of notation to quickly learn to read and write music.

To show how easy the new writing system was, Carrillo gave two [[New York (state)|New York]] [[elementary school]] boys, who had no prior knowledge of Sonido 13, a simple work by [[Bach]] to convert to his notation system. The boys accomplished the task in less than an hour, proving that the new writing method was easy to learn.

The new writing system is not as graphic as the conventional [[Staff (music)|staff or stave]], and instead of calling the notes by a letter or a syllable (Do, Re, Mi, etc.) they are represented by a number. The numbering system starts with a zero and increments by one until the last note of the octave is reached. Within this system, the number of notes in an octave is dependent on the number of intervals that one wishes to create within a whole tone.

[[File:Sonido13RegularOctave.png|frame|center|From Carrillo's "Teoría Lógica de la Música" ({{lang-en|Logical Theory of the Music}}) Converting current notes (above) to the new notation system (below). There are no smaller intervals in this case.]]

Carrillo used many intervals, although mainly in multiples of 4 such as 16, 32, and 64 so that between each of the whole tones, 16, 32, or 64 additional notes were created. Carrillo called these intervals 16hs of a tone, 32nds of a tone, and 64ths of a tone, respectively. As a result, C would be labeled 0, D flat would be labeled 8, D would be labeled 16, E flat would be labeled 24, E would be labeled 32, etc., for 16ths of a tone.

[[File:Sonido13WholeSixteenthTones.png|frame|center|From Carrillo's "Teoría Lógica de la Música" ({{lang-en|Logical Theory of the Music}}). Converting current notation (above) to sixteenths of a tone to the new notation system (below). 96-tet]]

When notating music, Carrillo used a staff.  However, instead of using lines to signify different notes, he used the lines to distinguish between octaves so that each line on the staff represents a different octave.  For example, if 0 on the second line of the staff denoted what conventional music terms [[middle C]], 0 on the third line would refer to C an octave higher, and 0 on the first line would refer to C an octave lower.

===Musical instruments===

This system added sounds unexplored by generations of musicians, so new adaptations of current instruments had to be made to support the small intervals, and for this reason the instruments were reduced in the number of octaves they contained. For example, a standard [[piano]] has 88 keys that cover more than 7 octaves, and a piano with 88 keys made for 16ths of a tone would not constitute a full octave. To have the same number of octaves as a conventional piano, a piano for 16ths of a tone would need 704 keys. So, using logic and innovative thoughts of modern [[luthier]]s, a traditional piano will be enriched infinitely. Every existing instrument has to be modified to adapt to the new rules of the Sonido 13 system, but also new instruments have to be designed and created. Thus, modern luthiers have an almost fantastic but still unexplored world in front of them, except by Carrillo's mind.

==Latest news==

New efforts are being done to resurrect the 13th Sound music and theory. In 2005 Mexican cellist Jimena Gimenez recently recorded the entire Carrillo's Cello Sonatas and Mexican-Quebecer guitarist Angélos Quetzalcóatl (The "Ambassador" of the 13th Sound) recorded almost all the guitar repertoire.

Besides these recording efforts, new music is being created using the Sonido 13 teachings and the Official Julián Carrillo Website was created by 13th sound musician Hugo Vargas. The website soon became extremely popular among Sonido 13 researchers and it gained the "Official" Status in 2009 thanks to the decision of Angel and Miguel Carrillo, executors of the Julián Carrillo Estate.

The "Ambassador of the 13th Sound" travels around the world promoting the 13th Sound principles which are:
1.- To Purify Music.
2.- To Enrich Music.
3.- To Facilitate Music.
He has achieved international recognition by Government Institutions, the executors of the Carrillo Estate and his peers due to his formidable commitment for totally resurrecting the Revolution of the 13th Sound.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34051">A '''state microbe''' is a [[microorganism]] used as an official state symbol. Several [[U.S. state]]s have honored their [[Microorganism|microbial]] residents by nominating them to become official [[Lists of United States state symbols|state symbols]].  The first state to declare an Official State Microbe is [[Oregon]] which chose ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' (brewer's or [[baker's yeast]]) as the Official Microbe of the State of Oregon in 2013 for its significance to the [[craft beer]] industry in Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.craftbrewingbusiness.com/ingredients-supplies/oregon-first-to-name-official-state-yeast/ |title=Oregon first to name official state yeast |first= Jason |last= Morgan |date= April 8, 2013|work=Craft Brewing Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first proponents of State Microbes was the eminent microbiologist Dr [[Moselio Schaechter]], who, in 2010, commented on Official Microbes for the American Society for Microbiology's blog "Small Things Considered"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://schaechter.asmblog.org/schaechter/2010/05/state-microbes.html|title=State Microbes|website=Small Things Considered|access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as on National Public Radio's "All Things Considered".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126055019|title=A State Microbe For Cheese-Crazed Wisconsin?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126370268|title=No State Microbe For Wisconsin|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hawai{{okina}}i 2013-14: ''Flavobacterium akiainvivens'' and/or ''Aliivibrio fischeri'', to be continued ...==
[[File:Hawaiian Bobtail squid.tiff|thumb|The bobtail squid can be a home for ''Aliivibrio fischeri''|209x209px]]
In January 2013, House Bill 293  was introduced by State Representative [[James Tokioka]]; the proposed bill designates ''[[Flavobacterium akiainvivens]]'' as the State Microbe of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hanahou.com/pages/magazine.asp?Action=DrawArticle&amp;ArticleID=1253|title=Hana Hou: The Magazine of Hawaiian Airlines - Current Issue|website=www.hanahou.com|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bacterium was discovered on a decaying [[Wikstroemia oahuensis|{{okina}}ākia]] shrub by [[ Iris Kuo]], a high school student working with [[Stuart Donachie]] at the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa|University of Hawai{{okina}}i at Manoa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cen.acs.org/articles/91/i19/Computers-Play-Super-Mario-States.html|title=Computers Play Super Mario, States Adopt Microbes {{!}} May 13, 2013 Issue - Vol. 91 Issue 19 {{!}} Chemical &amp; Engineering News|last=Torrice|first=Michael|website=cen.acs.org|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.microbiologyresearch.org/docserver/fulltext/ijsem/63/9/3280_ijs047217.pdf?expires=1511207051&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=91E6CAA72C95B5CC8D912EBA2842B88C|title=Flavobacterium akiainvivens sp. nov., from decaying wood of Wikstroemia oahuensis , Hawai'i, and emended  description of the genus Flavobacterium|journal=International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology|volume=63|issue=Pt 9|pages=3280–3286|last=Kuo, Iris et al.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|doi=10.1099/ijs.0.047217-0|pmid=23475344|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hawai{{okina}}ian context is strong here because the {{okina}}ākia shrub (''Wikstroemia oahuensis'') is native to Hawai{{okina}}i, and the microbe (''Flavobacterium akiainvivens)'' was first found in Hawai{{okina}}i. The shrub was used by ancient Hawai{{okina}}ians for medicine, textiles and for catching fish, while the microbe may have antibiotic properties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Aliivibrio fischeri.jpg|thumb|left|''Aliivibrio fischeri'' glowing on a petri dish]]
Although it was favored by the House, the ''Flavobacterium akiainvivens'' bill failed to get a hearing in the Senate Technology and Arts Committee (TEC) and could not move forward for a Senate vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hawaiireporter.com/competing-to-be-hawaiis-top-microbe/|title=Competing to be Hawaii's top microbe - Hawaii Reporter|date=2014-01-28|work=Hawaii Reporter|access-date=2017-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Wikstroemia oahuensis var. oahuensis (5187960983).jpg|thumb|''Flavobacterium akiavivensis'' was discovered in an akai bush.|202x202px]]  In February 2014, Senate Bill 3124 was introduced by Senator [[Glenn Wakai]]; the bill designates ''[[Aliivibrio fischeri]]'' as the State Microbe of Hawai{{okina}}i.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://damontucker.com/2014/02/24/bill-to-make-hawaiian-bobtail-squid-hawaiis-official-state-microbe-to-be-heard-tomorrow/|title=Bill to Make Hawaiian Bobtail Squid Hawaii’s Official State Microbe to be Heard Tomorrow|date=2014-02-25|work=Hawaii News and Island Information|access-date=2017-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2014/bills/SB3124_.pdf|title=SB3124 Hawaiian Senate Bill, 2014|last=Wakai|first=Glenn|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator Wakai was Chairman of the Senate Technology and Arts Committee that squashed the ''Flavobacterium'' legislation.  ''Aliivibrio fischeri'' was selected because it lives in a symbiotic relationship with the native [[Euprymna scolopes|Hawai{{okina}}ian bobtail squid]], in which it confers [[bioluminescence]] on the squid, enabling it to hunt at night.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although this is an awesome example of [[symbiosis]], political and scientific controversy erupted because even though the bobtail squid is only found in Hawai{{okina}}i, ''Aliivibrio fischeri'' can be found elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/State-Microbe-for-Hawaii-254376537973522/|title=State Microbe for Hawaii|last=|first=|date=|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Vibrio_fischeri_NEU2011|title=Vibrio fischeri NEU2011 - microbewiki|website=microbewiki.kenyon.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The combined Hawai{{okina}}ian Legislature could not agree on which microbe better suited Hawai{{okina}}i, and the proposed legislation was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/03/official-state-bacteria_n_5080910.html|title=Hawaii, Other States Calling Dibs On Official State Bacteria|last=Cave|first=James|date=2014-04-03|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislation proposing ''[[Flavobacterium akiainvivens]]'' as the State Microbe was re-introduced in 2017, {{See below|Hawaii 2017:  Flavobacterium akiainvivens, pending|mid=y}}.

==Oregon 2013: ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'', passed==
[[File:Saccharomyces cerevisiae SEM.jpg|thumb|Saccharomyces cerevisiae (brewer's yeast) as seen in a scanning electron micrograph.|left]]
[[Oregon]] was the first state to declare an Official State Microbe.[[File:MisterAlcohol Beer.png|thumb|Beer is a noteworthy product of brewer's yeast, the Official Microbe of Oregon.]]
In February 2013, House Concurrent Resolution 12 (HCR-12) was introduced into the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly|Oregon legislative system]] by [[Oregon House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Mark Johnson (Oregon politician)|Mark Johnson]]; the bill designates ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' (brewer's yeast or bakers yeast) as the Official Microbe of the State of Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/05/oregon_could_be_first_in_natio.html|title=Oregon is first in nation with official state microbe: brewer's yeast|work=OregonLive.com|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was passed by unanimous vote in the House on April 11; it passed in the Senate by a vote of 28 to 2 on May 23. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gov.oregonlive.com/bill/2013/HCR12/|title=Tracking House Concurrent Resolution 12 in the Oregon Legislature|work=Your Government :: The Oregonian|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cosponsors of the measure were: Representatives [[Michael Dembrow|Dembrow]], [[Mike McLane|McLane]], [[Jessica Vega Pederson|Vega Pederson]], [[Gene Whisnant|Whisnant]], [[Jennifer Williamson|Williamson]], and Senators [[Bill Hansell|Hansell]], [[Floyd Prozanski|Prozanski]], and [[Chuck Thomsen|Thomsen]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

HCR-12 recognizes the history of ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' in baking and brewing, thanks to its ability to convert fermentable sugars into [[ethanol]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. Most important for Oregon is that the microbe is essential to the production of [[Alcoholic drink|alcoholic beverages]] such as [[mead]], [[wine]], [[beer]], and distilled spirits. Moreover ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' inspired the thriving brew culture in Oregon, making Oregon an internationally recognized hub of [[Microbrewery|craft brewing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2013R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/HCR12/Enrolled|title=Enrolled House Concurrent Legislation 12|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The craft brewing business brings Oregon $2.4 billion annually, thanks to brewers yeast and talented brewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-04/beersci-oregon-wants-name-ale-yeast-its-official-microbe|title=Ale Yeast Running For Official State Microbe Of Oregon|work=Popular Science|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Jersey 2017-2018: ''Streptomyces griseus'', pending==

=== Introduction ===
''Streptomyces griseus'' was chosen for the honor of becoming the New Jersey State Microbe because the organism is a New Jersey native that made unique contributions to healthcare and scientific research worldwide. A strain of ''S. griseus'' that produced the antibiotic [[streptomycin]] was discovered in New Jersey in “heavily [[manure]]d field soil” from the New Jersey Agricultural Experimental Station by [[Albert Schatz (scientist)|Albert Schatz]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz A, Bugie E, Waksman SE. (1944). "Streptomycin, a Substance Exhibiting Antibiotic Activity Against Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative Bacteria". Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine. 55: 66–69.&lt;/ref&gt;  Streptomycin is noteworthy because it is: the first significant antibiotic discovered after [[penicillin]]; the first systemic [[Antibiotics|antibiotic]] discovered in America; the first antibiotic active against [[tuberculosis]]; first-line treatment for [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. Moreover, New Jersey was the home of [[Selman Waksman]], who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his systematic studies of antibiotic production by ''S. griseus'' and other soil microbes.&lt;ref&gt;''"The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1952". www.nobelprize.org. Retrieved 2017-11-16.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislative Activity ===
On May 15, 2017, Senate Bill 3190 (S3190) was introduced by [[New Jersey Senate|Senator]] [[Samuel D. Thompson]] (R-12); the bill designates ''[[Streptomyces griseus]]'' as the [[New Jersey]] State Microbe, to be added to [[List of New Jersey state symbols|the state's other state symbols]]. On June 1, 2017 [[New Jersey General Assembly|Assemblywoman]] [[Annette Quijano]] (D-20) introduced Assembly Bill 4900 (A4900); the bill also designates ''S. griseus'' as the New Jersey State Microbe, and is the Assembly counterpart of S3190.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2016/Bills/A5000/4900_I1.HTM|title=A4900|website=www.njleg.state.nj.us|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; S3190 was referred to the Senate State Government, Wagering, Tourism &amp; Historic Preservation Committee and A4900 was referred to the Assembly State and Local Government Committee for consideration and review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://legiscan.com/NJ/research/A4900/2016|title=New Jersey A4900 {{!}} 2016-2017 {{!}} Regular Session|work=LegiScan|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education Activity ===
The Rutgers University [[Rutgers School of Environmental and Biological Sciences|School of Environmental and Biological Science]] (SEBS) Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology has provided a web page since 2010 on which people can vote for one of three excellent choices for the New Jersey State Microbe. The candidates have been ''[[Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans]]'' (discovered in NJ, 1922), ''[[Azotobacter vinelandii]]'' (discovered in [[Vineland nj|Vineland, NJ]], 1903), and ''Streptomyces griseus'' ([[New Brunswick, NJ]] is home of the streptomycin-producing strain).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dbm.rutgers.edu/stateMicrobe.php|title=Vote for State Microbe {{!}} Department of Microbiology and Biochemistry at the Rutgers School of Environmental and Biological Sciences|website=dbm.rutgers.edu|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''S. griseus'' has been the winning microbe by a 3 to 1 margin. The Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology has also been actively involved in public education and outreach at annual Rutgers Day events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rutgersday.rutgers.edu/content/passion-puddle-area|title=Passion Puddle Area {{!}} Rutgers Day|website=rutgersday.rutgers.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, they received hundreds of signatures on a petition urging legislators to recognize ''S. griseus'' as the State Microbe. The microbiology community, both within and outside of NJ, has been an advocate for the State Microbe, actively submitting letters of endorsement to the New Jersey Legislature.

The New Jersey State Microbe was the subject of a presentation by John Warhol at the 2018 [[Rutgers University]] Microbiology Symposium,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dbm.rutgers.edu/MicrobioSymPrgrm2018.pdf|title=Rutgers Microbiology Symposium 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; video of the presentation is available [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iei0-tH03aI here]. Dr Warhol also spoke about the New Jersey State Microbe at the Theobald Smith Society (NJ Chapter of the American Society for Microbiology) Meeting in Miniature at [[Seton Hall University]] in April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shu.edu/arts-sciences/news/shu-to-host-theobald-smith-society-meeting.cfm|title=Seton Hall University to Host the Theobald Smith Society Meeting in Miniature - Seton Hall University|website=www.shu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Jersey State Microbe was the subject of a Science Cafe, titled The New Jersey State Microbe and You-- Perfect Together! held at the New Jersey Institute for Food, Nutrition, and Health on March 1. Presenters were Max Haggblom, Douglas Eveleigh, and John Warhol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://microminutes.tumblr.com/image/171385435429|title=Micro Minutes! : Photo|website=microminutes.tumblr.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, Dr Jeffrey Boyd spoke to students and teachers at the Bartle Elementary School in Highland Park, firing up their enthusiasm for microbial life in general and ''S. griseus'' in particular. The students were taught about microbiology, antibiotics, the interaction of science and public service, and how to contact their state legislators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://microminutes.tumblr.com/post/173991310639/microbial-school-outreach-rutgers-professor-dr|title=Micro Minutes!, Microbial School Outreach  Rutgers Professor Dr…|website=Micro Minutes!|language=en|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, John Warhol introduced the topic of microbiology and the State Microbe to students at the Indian Hill School in Holmdel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://microminutes.tumblr.com/post/175327698532/talking-about-microbes-in-school-i-had-the|title=Micro Minutes!, Talking about Microbes in School I had the…|website=Micro Minutes!|language=en|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;        

A scientific paper on the political and social process of designating an official state microbe was presented at Microbe 2018, the annual meeting of the American Society for Microbiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/4623/presentation/6277|title=Program Planner|website=www.abstractsonline.com|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titled "How to Get Your Own Official State Microbe" the presentation  stressed the importance of clear communication and legislator contact by academic, industrial, and student supporters.  The authors were Max Haggblom, Douglas Eveleigh, and John Warhol.     

In mid-September, John Warhol gave a public presentation on the New Jersey State Microbe and science communication at the Middletown, NJ Public Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://microminutes.tumblr.com/post/179828059459/microbe-talk-at-the-library-this-was-a-lot-of|title=Micro Minutes!, Microbe Talk at The Library.   This was a lot of...|website=Micro Minutes!|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mtpl.evanced.info/signup/Calendar|title=Middletown Library Presentation Calendar|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

An update on the New Jersey State Microbe project was given to students and faculty at the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia in October 2018 by John  Warhol, as part of a seminar on science communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://microminutes.tumblr.com/post/179462955804/university-of-the-sciences-presentation-wow-my|title=Micro Minutes!, University of the Sciences Presentation Wow, my...|website=Micro Minutes!|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

In November 2018, the New Jersey Historical Commission Forum on New Jersey History at Monmouth University was the venue for two presentations on the State Microbe. The first was titled "An Official New Jersey State Microbe! Streptomyces griseus" and the second was "The 75th Anniversary of the Discovery of Streptomycin - 2019". Authors of the presentations were Douglas Eveleigh, Jeff Boyd, Max Haagblom, Jessica Lisa, and John  Warhol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://microminutes.tumblr.com/post/179797494569/microbiology-at-the-nj-historical-commission-forum|title=Micro Minutes!, Microbiology at the NJ Historical Commission Forum...|website=Micro Minutes!|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nj.gov/state/historical/dos_his_forum-2018-1102.html|title=New Jersey Department of State - Historical Commission - Grants and Prizes|website=nj.gov|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

In early November 2018, Rutgers University launched a web page recognizing the Selman Waksman Museum at the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://waksmanmuseum.rutgers.edu/|title=Waksman Museum at Rutgers SEBS|website=waksmanmuseum.rutgers.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is housed in Dr Waksman's former laboratory space in Martin Hall.

==Hawaii 2017:  ''Flavobacterium akiainvivens'', pending==
In 2017, legislation similar to the original 2013 bill to make ''[[Flavobacterium akiainvivens]]'' the state microbe was submitted in the Hawai{{okina}}i House of Representatives by [[Isaac Choy]]&lt;ref name="HB1217"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=HB&amp;billnumber=1217&amp;year=2017|title=HB1217|last1=Choy|first1=Isaac|author-link1=Isaac Choy|date=25 January 2017|website=Hawaii State Legislature|publisher=[[Hawaii State Legislature]]|location=Honolulu, HI|language=English|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Hawaii Senate|Hawai{{okina}}i Senate]] by [[Brian Taniguchi]].&lt;ref name="SB1212"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=SB&amp;billnumber=1212&amp;year=2017|title=SB1212|last1=Taniguchi|first1=Brian|author-link1=Brian Taniguchi|date=25 January 2017|website=Hawaii State Legislature|publisher=[[Hawaii State Legislature]]|location=Honolulu, HI|language=English|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, Representative Choy submitted HB 1217 in the [[Hawaii House of Representatives|Hawaiʻi House of Representatives]] and Senator Taniguchi  submitted the mirror bill SB1212 in the [[Hawaii Senate|Hawaiʻi Senate]]. This continues the effort started by [[James Tokioka]] in 2013, and later contested in 2014 by Senator [[Glenn Wakai]]'s SB3124 bill proposing ''[[Aliivibrio fischeri]]'' instead. {{As of|2017|December}}, Hawaiʻi has no official state microbe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11303">'''Systematic ideology''' is a study of [[ideology|ideologies]] founded in the late 1930s in and around [[London]], [[England]] by Harold Walsby, George Walford and others. It seeks to understand the origin and development of ideologies, how ideologies and ideological groups work together, and the possibilities of guiding the development of ideologies on a global scale. The basic premise of systematic ideology is that ideology is the central [[motivation|motivator]] in human affairs; that the characteristics that make up the major ideologies come in sets; that those sets of characteristics form a series; and that the ideological series forms a system.

==History==
[[Image:Social Science Association - The Intellectual and the People.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of the Social Science Association pamphlet ''The Intellectual and the People'']]
The group that formed around Harold Walsby and his ideas was a breakaway from the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]]. During the [[Second World War]] this group developed a fascination with
perceived impediments to mass [[class consciousness|socialist consciousness]] among the [[working class]]. The theory they developed was expressed by Walsby himself in his 1947 book ''The Domain of Ideologies'' and those involved in the group set up an organisation to propagate their views called the '''Social Science Association''', which existed from 1944 until 1956, attracting a number of new recruits during the ‘[[Turner Controversy]]’. It was later succeeded by the
[[Walsby Society]] and the journal which emerged from it called ''Ideological Commentary''.

From the 1980s onwards, George Walford, editor of ''Ideological Commentary'' and former secretary of the SSA, watered down some of the theory’s more obviously [[elitist]] elements and even left the SPGB money at the time of his death. He did this on the grounds that although in his view the Party would never help achieve [[socialism]] it did perform a valuable function by
demonstrating through its application of critical analysis, logical thought and theory the limitations of other political groups that valued these less highly (a perspective which had informed Harold Walsby’s decision in 1950 to surreptitiously rejoin the Party through its postal branch
and write articles for the ''[[Socialist Standard]]'' under the pseudonym "H.W.S.Bee").

''Ideological Commentary'' survived until the death of Walford in 1994. {{As of|2007}}, barely a handful of systematic ideology's exponents remain.

Walsby, Walford and their group produced a large number of leaflets, pamphlets and other literature over time, a fair chunk of it dealing with the SPGB. The most readable expressions of systematic ideology are Walford’s book ''Beyond Politics'', published in 1990, and the pamphlet ''Socialist Understanding'', published ten years earlier.

==Theory==
The theory of the group developed over time and was re-christened ‘systematic ideology’ by Walford in 1976.  Its basic premise was that people’s assumptions and identifications (the factors making up their ‘ideology’) are not explicable in terms of [[materialism|material conditions]] in general and their relationship to the [[means of production]] in particular—and are never likely to be. Instead, there are persistent and distinct ideological groups in society, cutting across [[social class]]es and forming a series, with the largest groups being most typically guided in their thoughts and
actions by a preference for family, authority, familiarity and tradition. Politically, these preferences find predominant expression in the ideas of the large number of so-called
‘non-politicals’ in society, and in [[Conservatism]] and then [[Liberalism]] (the strength of these preferences gradually weakening through the series).

As the series progresses further, the next, progressively smaller, ideological groups seek to repress these identifications and preferences in favor of dynamism, social change, logical thought and the pursuit of theory as a guide to decision-making, these being expressed politically in [[Labourism]], more overtly still in [[Communism]] and then, in an ultimate and extreme form, in [[Anarchism]] (or ‘[[Libertarian socialism|Anarchosocialism]]’, the purist variety of it allegedly expounded by the Socialist Party of Great Britain). The more an ideology represses the preferences for family, tradition, etc. in favour of social change, dynamism and the pursuit of theory as a guide to action, the fewer in
number its adherents are likely to be, with anarchists (or ‘anarcho-socialists’) being the smallest of all. Those seeking radical social change, so the theory contends, will always be hampered and restrained by the enduring preferences of the largest ideological groups.

=== Walford ===

In his book, ''Beyond Politics'', George Walford seeks to analyse ideologies on the basis of its adherents' surface behaviors, their underlying sentiments and assumptions ("ethos"), and underlying cognitions ("eidos"). Of particular interest to him are a single group, ''the non-politicals'', and five major political ideologies, ''conservatism, liberalism, socialism, communism, and anarchism'', which can be listed as a series, with each seeking to "repress" its predecessor. He forms a series of hypotheses about the nature of those six ideologies, observing that they may be gauged upon different dimensions: according to ''relative size and political influence'' of its adherents, their relative ''reliance upon theory over practice'', and the ''degree to which they sought change''. He postulates that the non-politicals have the greatest influence and least interest in theory, while anarchists exhibit the least influence and greatest interest in theory, with the rest having mixed degrees of those properties.

He also formulates that each is relative to certain ideological ''ethos'': ''a) (short-term) expediency, b) (traditional) principles, c) precision, d) (fundamental) reform, e) revolution, and e) repudiation''. By his formulations, historical change, development of technology, and development of more complicated social relations can be explained as occurring in stages along this series. 
#For Walford, all societies historically begin in a state where a mass of individuals engage in ''expediency'' at the hunter-gatherer level. This state of affairs is characterized by short-term individual economic behavior and collective political action.
#Societies grow to have more advanced and secure political systems at the same time that they make better use of agricultural technology with more long-term goals in mind. In the process, economic behavior becomes more and more collectivistic. From then on, the societies engage in wars, and conquer. Empires grow, and create obedience with the mask of ''traditional principles''.
#Finally, societies enter a stage where principles espoused actually begin to be followed, enacted, and made more ''precise''. Similarly, economic production becomes more bureaucratic and rationally goal-oriented.
#The remaining three forms of ethos -- ''reform, revolution, and repudiation''—are, when taken together, seen to compose the envisioned fourth stage in historical development.

While some other philosophers have expressed the opinion that political liberalism is the peak or end-stage of historical development (see [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s "End of History" thesis), Walford claims the opposite. "More than ever before, our world is a boiling, bounding, bubbling ferment of ideological novelty, and the rate of change is accelerating. If the ideological system has reached completion it is only in the sense that a newborn child is complete." (Beyond Politics)

==Criticism==
Historically, systematic ideology has been unable to produce a [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] and causal model for what it is that influences some people and not others to gravitate towards a particular ideology.

Walsby’s early version of the theory was clearly [[hierarchical]] (with those understanding the theory being the smallest group of all, metaphorically positioned at the apex of a pyramid, just above the SPGB) and it lent itself to criticism on the grounds that it was merely a particularly
convoluted type of ‘[[human nature]]’ argument. This was essentially the response outlined in the ''Socialist Standard''’s April 1949 review of Walsby’s book, called ''The Domain of Sterilities''.

Twin studies have shown that genetics have a strong effect on both attitude formation, and receptivity to ideological affiliation.  This may provide some answer to the criticism that systematic ideology lacks a causal model. According to one study:
:We found that political attitudes are influenced much more heavily by genetics than by parental socialization. For the overall index of political conservatism, genetics accounts for approximately half the variance in ideology while shared environment (including parental socialization) accounts for only 11 percent.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6148">{{DISPLAYTITLE:Taxonomy of ''Adenanthos''}}
'''[[George Bentham]]'s taxonomic arrangement of ''[[Adenanthos]]''''' was the first comprehensive taxonomic arrangement of that [[plant]] [[genus]]. It was published in 1870 in his landmark [[flora]] of [[Australia]], ''[[Flora Australiensis]]''. It would stand for over a hundred years before being superseded by [[Nelson's taxonomic arrangement of Adenanthos|the 1978 arrangement]] of [[Ernest Charles Nelson]].

==Background==
{{see also|Adenanthos}}
''Adenanthos'' is a genus of around 30 [[species]] in the plant [[family (biology)|family]] [[Proteaceae]]. Endemic to southern [[Australia]], they are [[evergreen]] [[woody plant|woody]] [[shrubs]] with solitary [[flowers]] that are [[pollination|pollinated]] by [[birds]] and, if [[fertilisation|fertilised]], develop into [[achene]]s. They are not much [[Plant cultivation|cultivated]]. Common names of species often include one of the terms ''woollybush'', ''jugflower'' and ''stick-in-the-jug''.&lt;ref name="Wrigley 1991"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wrigley, John Walter |author2=Fagg, Murray | year = 1991 | chapter = Genus ''Adenanthos'' | pages = 58–73 | title = Banksias, Waratahs and Grevilleas, and all other plants in the Australian Proteaceae family | edition = 1991 reprint | publisher = Angus &amp; Robertson | isbn = 0-207-17277-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known botanical collection of ''Adenanthos'' was made by [[Archibald Menzies]] during the September 1791 visit of the [[Vancouver Expedition]] to [[King George Sound]] on the south coast of [[Western Australia]]. However this did not lead to publication of the genus. [[Jacques Labillardière]] collected specimens of ''[[Adenanthos cuneatus|A.&amp;nbsp;cuneatus]]'' from Esperance Bay the following year, and in 1803 [[Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour]] collected the same two species as Menzies had 12 years earlier. Labillardière published the genus in 1805, in his ''[[Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen]]'', based on the specimens collected by himself and Leschenault. The genus was given the name ''Adenanthos'' from the [[Greek language|Greek]] αδην (''aden-'', "gland") and ανθοσz (''-anthos'', "flower"), in reference to the prominent [[nectary|nectaries]].&lt;ref name="Nelson 1978"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nelson, Ernest Charles | year = 1978 | title = A taxonomic revision of the genus ''Adenanthos'' Proteaceae | journal = Brunonia | volume = 1 | pages = 303–406 | doi=10.1071/BRU9780303}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1870, 13 species had been published. That year, Bentham published the fifth volume of his ''Flora Australiensis'', in which was contained a treatment of the plant family [[Proteaceae]], including ''Adenanthos''.&lt;ref name="Bentham 1870"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | author = Bentham, George | year = 1870 | title = ''Adenanthos'' | encyclopedia = [[Flora Australiensis]] | volume = 5 | pages = 350–356 | location = London | publisher = L. Reeve &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bentham's arrangement==
In his treatment of ''Adenanthos'', Bentham published a fourteenth species, and the first infrageneric arrangement: he divided the genus into two [[taxonomic section]]s, [[Adenanthos sect. Eurylaema|''A.''&amp;nbsp;sect. ''Eurylaema'']] and [[Adenanthos sect. Stenolaema|''A.''&amp;nbsp;sect. ''Stenolaema'']], based on the shape of the [[perianth]] tube: members of ''A.''&amp;nbsp;sect. ''Eurylaema'' have perianth tubes that are curved and swollen above the middle, whereas members of ''A.''&amp;nbsp;sect. ''Stenolaena'' have perianth tubes that are straight and unswollen. The full arrangement is as follows:&lt;ref name="Bentham 1870"/&gt;
:''[[Adenanthos]]''
::[[Adenanthos sect. Eurylaema|''A.''&amp;nbsp;sect. ''Eurylaema'']]
:::''A.&amp;nbsp;barbigera'' (now ''[[Adenanthos barbiger|A.&amp;nbsp;barbiger]]'')
:::''A.&amp;nbsp;obovata'' (now ''[[Adenanthos obovatus|A.&amp;nbsp;obovatus]]'')
::''A.''&amp;nbsp;sect. ''Stenolaena'' (now [[Adenanthos sect. Adenanthos|''A.''&amp;nbsp;sect. ''Adenanthos'']])
:::''A.&amp;nbsp;cuneata'' (now ''[[Adenanthos cuneatus|A.&amp;nbsp;cuneatus]]'')
:::''A.&amp;nbsp;Cunninghamii'' (now ''[[Adenanthos × cunninghamii|A.&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;cunninghamii]]'')
:::''[[Adenanthos pungens|A.&amp;nbsp;pungens]]''
:::''A.&amp;nbsp;venosa'' (now ''[[Adenanthos venosus|A.&amp;nbsp;venosus]]'')
:::''A.&amp;nbsp;Dobsoni'' (now ''[[Adenanthos dobsonii|A.&amp;nbsp;dobsonii]]'')
:::''[[Adenanthos linearis|A.&amp;nbsp;linearis]]''
:::''A.&amp;nbsp;sericea'' (now ''[[Adenanthos sericeus|A.&amp;nbsp;sericeus]]'')
:::''A.&amp;nbsp;Meissneri'' (now ''[[Adenanthos meisneri|A.&amp;nbsp;meisneri]]'')
:::''A.&amp;nbsp;filifolia'' (now ''[[Adenanthos filifolius|A.&amp;nbsp;filifolius]]'')
:::''[[Adenanthos terminalis|A.&amp;nbsp;terminalis]]''
:::''A.&amp;nbsp;flavidiflora'' (now ''[[Adenanthos flavidiflorus|A.&amp;nbsp;flavidiflorus]]'')
:::''A.&amp;nbsp;apiculata'' (now ''[[Adenanthos apiculatus|A.&amp;nbsp;apiculatus]]'')

==Legacy==
Bentham's arrangement stood for over a hundred years, by which time a number of new species had been discovered, rendering Bentham's treatment "very inadequate and incomplete".&lt;ref name="Nelson 1978"/&gt; His division of the genus into two sections based on perianth shape is still accepted today, but changes in the laws of [[botanical nomenclature]] mean that ''A.''&amp;nbsp;sect. ''Stenolaema'' is now known as [[Adenanthos sect. Adenanthos|''A.''&amp;nbsp;sect. ''Adenanthos'']], and all specific epithets now have masculine gender; for example, the species that Bentham referred to as ''Adenanthos barbigera'' is now named ''[[Adenanthos barbiger]]''.&lt;ref name="Nelson 1995"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | author = Nelson, Ernest Charles | year = 1995 | title = ''Adenanthos'' | editor = McCarthy, Patrick | encyclopedia = [[Flora of Australia (series)|Flora of Australia]] | volume = 16 | pages = 314–342 | location = Collingwood, Victoria | publisher = CSIRO Publishing / Australian Biological Resources Study | isbn = 0-643-05692-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Egyptian appliqué at Textile Research Centre, Leiden.jpg|thumb|Egyptian appliqué]]

The '''Textile Research Centre (TRC),''' [[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]], is an independent research institute working in the field of [[Textile|textiles]] and [[Clothing|dress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trc-leiden.nl|title=Textile Research Centre, Leiden|accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is housed at Hogewoerd 164 in Leiden and includes exhibition space, storage rooms, a lecture room and other working areas. The current director of the TRC (per November 2010) is Gillian Vogelsang-Eastwood, a textile and dress historian.

==Aims==
The TRC has the stated aim of encouraging research into [[wiktionary:anthropological|anthropological]] and [[wiktionary:archaeological|archaeological]] textiles and clothing in the widest sense of the word. In particular, the TRC specialises in dress - what people wear in order to express their identity - and pre-industrial textile technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=General information |url=https://www.trc-leiden.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=103&amp;Itemid=118&amp;lang=en |website=www.trc-leiden.nl |accessdate=8 September 2018 |language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The TRC was founded in 1991 as a ''[[Stichting]]'' (foundation; [[wiktionary:non-profit|non-profit]] organisation). Since then it has been involved in many aspects of the academic study of [[wiktionary:textiles|textiles]] and dress, especially those from the [[Near East]].

In 1997 the TRC started building up a textile and dress collection. By late 2010 the collection had grown to over 6,500 textiles, garments and accessories from all over the world. Most of the garments come from the Near East and [[Islamic]] lands: notably, [[Afghanistan]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[Oman]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]. It also has a large collection of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] regional dress. Many of the garments were obtained during fieldwork by TRC staff and students, whilst others were purchased or given as donations.

Until August 2009 the TRC was housed in the [[National Museum of Ethnology (Netherlands)|National Museum of Ethnology]], Leiden, but since then it has moved to new premises in the centre of Leiden. It now organises a series of exhibitions, lectures, workshops and training courses for students and others who are interested. Recent exhibitions included: ''Embroidery from the Arab World'' (2009–2010)&lt;ref name=embroidery /&gt; and ''Well-Dressed Afghanistan'' (2010–2011).&lt;ref name=afghanistan /&gt;

Middle Eastern dress remains a focal point of the TRC. The veils in the TRC collection, for instance, were used for a major exhibition at the National Museum of Ethnology, Leiden (1996), and for various publications, including ''Covering the Moon: An Introduction to Middle Eastern Face Veils''.&lt;ref name=vogelsang2008&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vogelsang-Eastwood |first1=Gillian |last2=Vogelsang |first2=W.

'''''The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down: A Hmong Child, Her American Doctors, and the Collision of Two Cultures''''' is a 1997 book by [[Anne Fadiman]] that chronicles the struggles of a [[Hmong people|Hmong]] refugee family from Houaysouy, [[Sainyabuli Province]], [[Laos]],&lt;ref name="Fadiman103"&gt;[[Anne Fadiman|Fadiman]]. "Foua and Nao Kao." ''The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux. 1997. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DUHAXXvSUeYC&amp;pg=PA103 103]. "[...]I asked her to describe a typical day in Houaysouy, the village in the northwestern province of Sayaboury where the Lee family had lived."&lt;/ref&gt; the Lees, and their interactions with the health care system in [[Merced, California]]. In 2005 Robert Entenmann, [[Ph.D.]], of [[St. Olaf College]] wrote that the book is "certainly the most widely read book on the Hmong experience in America."&lt;ref name=Entenmannp1&gt;Entenmann, Robert. "[http://hmongstudies.org/EntenmannHSJ6.pdf The Myth of Sonom, the Hmong King]." ({{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6QyjDhsaM?url=http://hmongstudies.org/EntenmannHSJ6.pdf |date=2014-07-11 }}) ''[[Hmong Studies Journal]]'', Volume 6, 2005. p. 1. Retrieved on July 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the most basic level, the book tells the story of the family's second youngest and favored daughter, Lia Lee, who was diagnosed with a severe form of [[epilepsy]] named [[Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome]]  and the culture conflict that obstructs her treatment.

Through miscommunications about medical dosages and parental refusal to give certain medicines due to mistrust, misunderstandings, and behavioral side effects, and the inability of the doctors to develop more empathy with the traditional Hmong lifestyle or try to learn more about the Hmong culture, Lia's condition worsens. The dichotomy between the Hmong's perceived spiritual factors and the Americans' perceived scientific factors comprises the overall theme of the book.

The book is written in a unique style, with every other chapter returning to Lia's story and the chapters in-between discussing broader themes of [[Hmong customs and culture|Hmong culture, customs, and history]]; American involvement in and responsibility for the war in Laos; and the many problems of immigration, especially assimilation and discrimination. While particularly sympathetic to the Hmong, Fadiman presents the situation from the perspectives of both the doctors and the family. An example of [[medical anthropology]], the book has been cited by medical journals and lecturers as an argument for greater [[cultural competence]], and often assigned to medical, pharmaceutic, and anthropological students in the US. In 1997, it won the [[National Book Critics Circle]] Award for General Nonfiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bookcritics.org/awards/past_awards/page_2 National Book Critics Circle - past awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

She had seizures due to ''[[Lennox–Gastaut syndrome|Lennox-Gastaut]]'' [[Lennox–Gastaut syndrome|syndrome]], a severe form of ''epilepsy''.

'''Anne Fadiman''': She is an author and narrator of ‘The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down’. She wrote about her experience with Lia and her family. Through this experience, she learned the importance of understanding about diversity of culture between doctor, patient, and family.

'''Neil Ernst and Peggy Philp''': They are Lia’s doctors at MCMC. There is conflict between them and Lia's parents because of Hmong shamanism culture versus western medicine.  This leads to great misunderstandings between each other.

'''Foua Yang and Nao Kao Lee''': They are Lia’s parents, and they love Lia very much. They only believe in their traditional approach to medical treatment, with a strong influence from shamanism.

'''Jeanine Hilt''': A [[social work]]er who makes Lia her personal cause. She fights against the medical establishment on Lia’s behalf and cares for the Hmong as a significant culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Clapsaddle|first=Diane|title=The Spirit Catches You Study Guide02|url=http://thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Spirit_Catches_You_Fadiman/The_Spirit_Catches_You_Study_Guide02.html|website=TheBestNotes.com|date=20 Mar 2015|accessdate=12 Apr 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fadiman/&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Merced, Mercy General.JPG|thumb|[[Mercy Medical Center Merced]], previously the Merced Community Medical Center; this is a new building and not the previous building where Lia Lee was taken]]
Lia experienced her first [[seizure]] at three months of age, but a resident at [[Merced Community Medical Center]] misdiagnosed her condition, and the hospital was unable to communicate with her parents since the hospital had no [[Hmong language|Hmong]] interpreters. [[Anne Fadiman]] wrote that Lia's parents did not give her medication as it was prescribed because they believed that Lia Lee's state showed a sense of spiritual giftedness, and they did not want to take that away. The American doctors did not understand the Hmong traditional remedies that the Lee family used. The doctors treating Lia Lee, Neil and Peggy Ernst, had her removed from her home when she was almost three years of age, and placed into [[foster care]] for one year, causing friction with her parents. By age 4½ Lia Lee had been admitted to hospital care 17 times and had made over 100 outpatient visits.&lt;ref name=Foxdead2&gt;Fox, Margalit. "Lia Lee Dies; Life Went On Around Her, Redefining Care." ''[[The New York Times]]''. September 14, 2012. [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/15/us/life-went-on-around-her-redefining-care-by-bridging-a-divide.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0&amp;ref=obituaries 2]. Retrieved on October 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The worst seizure Lia had put her onto the verge of death. She went to the emergency room and Dr. Neil Ernst could not do anything. He talked to Lia's parents about transferring her to Fresno, California because Lia would need further treatment that Dr. Ernst could not provide.  Lia's parents ". . .  believed their daughter was transferred not because of her critical condition but because of the Ernst's vacation plans".
Lia Lee slipped into a coma after suffering from a [[grand mal seizure]] in 1986, when she was four years of age. Lia Lee's doctors believed she would die, but Lia Lee remained alive but with no higher brain functions.&lt;ref name=Foxdead2/&gt;

==Research==
{{expand section|date=July 2014}}
Fadiman's sources for information about the history of the Hmong include ''[[Hmong: History of a People]]'' by Keith Quincy. She stated "Were I citing the source of each detail, Quincy's name would attach itself to nearly every sentence in the pages on the Hmong in China."&lt;ref name=fadiman&gt;{{citation|last=Fadiman|title=The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down|date=September 30, 1998|isbn=9781429931113|url=http://anthropology.msu.edu/anp370-us15/files/2015/05/The-Spirit-Catches-You-and-You-Anne-Fadiman.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fadiman's book cited the Quincy theory that the Hmong people originated from Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Pfeifer|Pfeifer, Mark E.]] ([[Hmong Cultural and Resource Center]]). "[http://hmongstudies.org/PremodernHmongHistory.pdf Overview of Recent Scholarship on Premodern Hmong History]" ({{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Qz49SIUA?url=http://hmongstudies.org/PremodernHmongHistory.pdf |date=2014-07-11 }}).

Marilyn Mochel, a nurse and clinical educator at Sutter Merced Medical Center&lt;!--This is the hospital which treated Lia Lee!!!!--&gt; (now [[Mercy Medical Center Merced]]), who heads the hospital's cross-cultural program, said in 1999 that "The book has allowed more dialogue.

Retrieved on October 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the [[State of California]] Lia Lee's death was not widely reported. Fadiman said that [[pneumonia]] was the immediate cause of death. Margalit Fox of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said "[b]ut Lia’s underlying medical issues were more complex still" because she had lived in a persistent vegetative state for such a long period of time. As of 2012 most individuals who go into that state die three to five years afterwards.&lt;ref name=Foxdead1/&gt;

==Reception==
Ralph Jennings of ''[[The Modesto Bee]]'' said "Hmong, including some among the 2,000 in [[Modesto, California|Modesto]], say the book typified conflicts between their culture and American institutions. But some say it didn't capture the complexity of the Hmong culture."&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt;

Cheng Lee, a brother of Lia Lee, said that his father and mother liked Fadiman's book.&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt;

“Compellingly written, from the heart and from the trenches. I couldn’t wait to finish it, then reread it and ponder it again. It is a powerful case study of a medical tragedy.” - David H. Mark, Journal of the American Medical Association

Anne Fadiman's essay "Hmong Odyssey," adapted from the book, was published in the March–April 1998 ''[[Via (magazine)|Via]]''. The Hmong community leaders in [[Fresno, California]] praised the essay, saying that it was thoughtful and accurate.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=FB&amp;p_theme=fb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAE8A732D83B82C&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM ESSAY VS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5949">'''Tupper's self-referential formula''' is a [[formula]] that visually represents itself when graphed at a specific location in the (''x'', ''y'') plane.

== History ==

The formula was defined by Jeff Tupper and appears as an example in Tupper's 2001 [[SIGGRAPH]] paper on reliable two-dimensional computer graphing algorithms.
&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/mooncake/papers/SIGGRAPH2001_Tupper.pdf Tupper, Jeff. "Reliable Two-Dimensional Graphing Methods for Mathematical Formulae with Two Free Variables"]&lt;/ref&gt; This paper discusses methods related to the GrafEq formula-graphing program developed by Tupper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peda.com/grafeq/|title=Pedagoguery Software: GrafEq|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the formula is called "[[self-reference|self-referential]]", Tupper did not name it as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Narayanan |first1=Arvind |title=Tupper’s Self-Referential Formula Debunked |url=http://arvindn.livejournal.com/132943.html |accessdate=20 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424181239/http://arvindn.livejournal.com/132943.html |archivedate=24 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formula ==

The formula is an [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;{1\over 2} &lt; \left\lfloor \mathrm{mod}\left(\left\lfloor {y \over 17} \right\rfloor 2^{-17 \lfloor x \rfloor - \mathrm{mod}(\lfloor y\rfloor, 17)},2\right)\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
or, as plaintext,
{{quotation|1/2 &lt; floor(mod(floor(y/17)*2^(-17*floor(x)-mod(floor(y), 17)),2))}}

where ⌊&amp;nbsp;⌋ denotes the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor function]], and mod is the [[modulo operation]].

Let ''k'' equal the following 543-digit integer:

{{quotation|960 939 379 918 958 884 971 672 962 127 852 754 715 004 339 660 129 306 651 505 519 271 702 802 395 266 424 689 642 842 174 350 718 121 267 153 782 770 623 355 993 237 280 874 144 307 891 325 963 941 337 723 487 857 735 749 823 926 629 715 517 173 716 995 165 232 890 538 221 612 403 238 855 866 184 013 235 585 136 048 828 693 337 902 491 454 229 288 667 081 096 184 496 091 705 183 454 067 827 731 551 705 405 381 627 380 967 602 565 625 016 981 482 083 418 783 163 849 115 590 225 610 003 652 351 370 343 874 461 848 378 737 238 198 224 849 863 465 033 159 410 054 974 700 593 138 339 226 497 249 461 751 545 728 366 702 369 745 461 014 655 997 933 798 537 483 143 786 841 806 593 422 227 898 388 722 980 000 748 404 719}}

If one [[Graph of a function|graphs]] the set of points (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') in 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;106 and ''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;17 satisfying the inequality given above, the resulting graph looks like this (the axes in this plot have been reversed, otherwise the picture would be upside-down and mirrored):

[[File:Tupper's self referential formula plot.svg]]
[[File:Tupper_formula_constant_derivation.svg|thumb|91px&lt;!-- 91px gives acceptable text rendering with least overshoot or ugly gaps --&gt;|Derivation of ''k'']]

The formula is a general-purpose method of decoding a bitmap stored in the constant&amp;nbsp;''k'', and it could actually be used to draw any other image.  When applied to the unbounded positive range 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y'', the formula tiles a vertical swath of the plane with a pattern that contains all possible 17-pixel-tall bitmaps.  One horizontal slice of that infinite bitmap depicts the drawing formula itself, but this is not remarkable, since other slices depict all other possible formulae that might fit in a 17-pixel-tall bitmap. Tupper has created extended versions of his original formula that rule out all but one slice.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peda.com/selfplot/selfplot3big.png&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peda.com/selfplot/selfplot2.png&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peda.com/selfplot/selfplot.png&lt;/ref&gt;

The constant ''k'' is a simple [[1-bit color|monochrome]] [[bitmap|bitmap image]] of the formula treated as a binary number and multiplied by 17.  If ''k'' is divided by 17, the [[least significant bit]] encodes the upper-right corner (''k'',&amp;nbsp;0); the 17 least significant bits encode the rightmost column of pixels; the next 17 least significant bits encode the 2nd-rightmost column, and so on.
