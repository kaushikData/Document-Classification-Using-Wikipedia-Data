      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10142">Active Perception is where an agents' behaviors are selected in order to increase the information content derived from the flow of sensor data obtained by those behaviors in the environment in question.  In other words, in order to understand the world we move around and explore it.  We sample the world through our eyes, ears, nose, skin, and tongue as we explore and construct an understanding (Perception) of the environment on the basis of this behavior (Action).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The senses considered as perceptual systems.|last=Gibson|first=J. J.|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1966|isbn=978-0313239618|location=Oxford England|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the construct of Active Perception, the interpretation of sensor data (perception) is inherently inseparable from the behaviors required to capture that data - action (behaviors) and perception (interpretation of sensor data) are tightly coupled.  This has been developed most comprehensively with respect to vision ([[Active vision|Active Vision]]) where  an agent (animal, robot, human, camera mount) changes position in order to improve the view of a specific object and/or where the agent uses movement in order to perceive the environment (e.g. for obstacle avoidance).

More formally Active Perception has been defined as follows:

"Active Perception (Active Vision specifically) is defined as a study of Modeling and Control strategies for perception. By modeling we mean models of sensors, processing modules and their interaction. We distinguish local models from global models by their extent of application in space and time. The local models represent procedures and parameters such as optical distortions of the lens, focal lens, spatial resolution, band-pass filter, etc. The global models on the other hand characterize the overall performance and make predictions on how the individual modules interact. The control strategies are formulated as a search of such sequence of steps that would minimize a loss function while one is seeking the most information. Examples are shown as the existence proof of the proposed theory on obtaining range from focus and sterolvergence on 2-0 segmentation of an image and 3-0 shape parametrization".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bajcsy|first=Ruzena|date=August 1988|title=Active Perception|url=https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yang/courses/cs294-6/papers/Bajcsy.active%20Perception.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|volume=76, 8|pages=996–1005|via=|doi=10.1109/5.5968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Optical flow|The theory of Optical Flow]] was derived from concepts of Active Perception, and while optical flow is now typically considered to be a vector representation of motion captured by a vision sensor (camera), it was originally described in terms of Active Perception.  The behavior of the agent (animal, robot, human) in the world generates a flow of data over the visual sensor (camera, eye) which is sampled by the sensor and interpreted into a percept of the environment by the agent, through some computation.  On the basis of this percept the agent then selects another behavior that generates more data flow.  Thus Optical Flow is the data flow carried by light from the environment to the vision sensor as a result of movement in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Perception of the Visual World|last=Gibson|first=J. J.|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1950|isbn=978-1114828087|location=Oxford England|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a related but narrower definition of '''active perception''' that [[perception]] and action are represented within the brain as the same thing. It states that when a person sees an action done, it is internally translated into, and understood within the context of, an action that they could do. This supports the capability in people and animals of learning what to do based on what they see others doing.&lt;ref&gt;(Bargh &amp; Dijksterhuis, 2001, p. 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological Psychology==
Active Perception is part of the broader field of [[ecological psychology]]. Ecological Psychology (and theories of Ecological Perception) was formulated by [[gestalt psychology|gestalt psychologists]] in the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;Koffka, 1936&lt;/ref&gt; and refined by Gibson through the 1950s to 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 1979, The [[Ecological Theory of Perception]], Haughton and Mifflin, Boston&lt;/ref&gt; The theory has held strong, although for the approximately 80 years that it has been around, it has always been considered a niche area of [[psychology]]. Ecological Perception has had little traction in medicine, for instance, until recently, when a series of coherent hypotheses proposed that active perception is the basis for developmental disorders and psychiatric symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Avenanti, A., &amp; Urgesi, C. (2011). Understanding 'what' others do: mirror mechanisms play a crucial role in action perception. Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, 6(3), 257-259. {{doi|10.1093/scan/nsr004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buccino | first1 = G. | last2 = Amore | first2 = M. | year = 2008 | title = Mirror neurons and the understanding of behavioural symptoms in psychiatric disorders | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Psychiatry | volume = 21 | issue = 3| page = 281 | doi=10.1097/yco.0b013e3282fbcd32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Golembiewski | first1 = J | year = 2012 | title = All common psychotic symptoms can be explained by the theory of ecological perception | url = | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 7–10 | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2011.09.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rizzolatti | first1 = G. | last2 = Fabbri-Destro | first2 = M. | last3 = Cattaneo | first3 = L. | year = 2009 | title = Mirror neurons and their clinical relevance | url = | journal = Nature Clinical Practice Neurology | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 24–34 | doi=10.1038/ncpneuro0990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recognition of objects and opportunities (or ''[[affordances]]'') as they are called by Gibson, is a function of the Ecological Perception. A glass of water is recognized through the fact that it supports a desire to drink, and a book by reading, although usually affordances are considered at a more basic level e.g. that rock affords me to sit upon it. The fact that most people don't read every book that comes their way, drink every glass of water, or sit on every rock, is thought to be a function of a secondary inhibition process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Golembiewski | first1 = J | year = 2012 | title = All common psychotic symptoms can be explained by the theory of ecological perception | url = | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 7–10 | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2011.09.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus people with damaged inhibitory circuitry (in the [[frontal lobe]] of the brain) have no choice but to act in the face of perception. The classic examples are in the studies of [[environmental dependence syndrome]] and [[utilization behavior]] by.&lt;ref&gt;Avenanti, A., &amp; Urgesi, C. (2011).

== Applications of Active Perception ==
There is a wide range of work on the application of active perception to robotics, including ground vehicles, underwater vehicles, and air vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=active+perception+in+robotics&amp;oq=active+perception+in+robotics&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3761j0j8&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8|title=Google search for "Active Perception in Robotics"|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As one would expect, when optical flow is included in the definition of active perception then the volume of related work significantly increases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4532">'''Aham''', a concept of [[Kashmir Shaivism]], is defined as the supreme heart ''{{IAST|(hṛdayam)}}'',&lt;ref name="Jaideva Singh page 78"&gt;{{IAST|Parā-trīśikā Vivaraṇa}}, Jaideva Singh, page 78&lt;/ref&gt; transcendent [[Atman (Hinduism)|Self]], supreme I awareness &lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Parā-trīśikā Vivaraṇa}}, Jaideva Singh, page 131&lt;/ref&gt; or infinite consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;The Triadic Heart of Śiva, Paul Muller-Ortega, page 145&lt;/ref&gt; The space of ''Aham'' is where ''khecarī mudrā'' (free movement in the space of the heart) is realised. ''[[Khecarī mudrā]]'' is considered the supreme state of spiritual evolution.

==Substrate of creation==
When [[Śiva]] wants to create, the first step is said to be the creation of an interior space (the space of his heart) - a matrix of [[energies]] that will be the substrate of the new world. This place is called ''Aham'' which means "I" in [[Sanskrit]]. Thus the absolute first creates the [[divine]] person, ''Aham'', and from this divine person will appear the manifestation itself.

''Aham'' is identical to ''{{IAST|mātṛkā}}'' (the wheel of phonematic energies), essential nature of all categories from ''[[The 36 tattvas#p.E1.B9.9Bithv.C4.AB - earth|{{IAST|Pṛithvī tattva}}]]'' (earth) to ''[[The 36 tattvas#sad.C4.81.C5.9Biva|{{IAST|Sadāśiva tattva}}]]'',.&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Parā-trīśikā Vivaraṇa}} Jaideva Singh, page 194&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aham'' is the final resting place, dwelling place, abode of all beings, receptacle of the world.&lt;ref name="Jaideva Singh page 78"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Triadic Heart of Śiva, Paul Muller-Ortega, page 179&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ultimate mantra==
Another definition of ''Aham'' is that of primordial mantra,&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Kuṇḍalinī}}, the energy of the depths, page 214&lt;/ref&gt; transcendental mantra,&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Parā-trīśikā Vivaraṇa}}, Jaideva Singh, page 180&lt;/ref&gt; the so-called heart-bīja (mantra of the heart) - force and power of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;The Triadic Heart of Śiva, Paul Muller-Ortega, page 163&lt;/ref&gt; As the supreme mantra, ''Aham'' is closely related to ''matravīrya'' (the potency of mantra).&lt;ref&gt;The Triadic Heart of Śiva, Paul Muller-Ortega, page 160&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the realization of ''Aham'' confers power over any mantra.&lt;ref name="Jaideva Singh page 195"&gt;{{IAST|Parā-trīśikā Vivaraṇa}}, Jaideva Singh, page 195&lt;/ref&gt;

==United form of Shiva and Shakti==
In ''Aham'', the supreme (para) aspect of [[Śakti]] is realized. ''Aham'' is the ''Śakti'' of ''Śiva'' or in other words, the expansion of Śiva.&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Parā-trīśikā Vivaraṇa}}, Jaideva Singh, page 127&lt;/ref&gt; Another way of describing ''Aham'' is as the union of ''Śiva'' and ''Śakti'',&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Parā-trīśikā Vivaraṇa}}, Jaideva Singh, page 194&lt;/ref&gt; the emittive (''visarga'') aspect of the Supreme (''anuttara'').&lt;ref name="Jaideva Singh page 195"/&gt;

==Etymology==
Aham is formed of A+HA+M, a triad of ''Śhiva'' (A), ''Śakti'' (HA) and bindu (M).&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Parā-trīśikā Vivaraṇa}}, Jaideva Singh, page 55&lt;/ref&gt; M is the final point, union of ''Śiva'' and ''Śakti'', where they dissolve into ''Paramaśiva''. The [[triangle]] of A+HA+M is the essence of the ''Trika'' system.&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Kuṇḍalinī}}, the energy of the depths, page 32&lt;/ref&gt; A+HA+M form the ''{{IAST|sṛṣṭi bīja}}'' (seed of emission), a mantra that is identical to the energy of expansion and creation.&lt;ref name="Jaideva Singh page 13"&gt;{{IAST|Parā-trīśikā Vivaraṇa}}, Jaideva Singh, page 13&lt;/ref&gt;

''Aham'' can also be defined as: A = ''abedha'' (non-differentiation), HA = ''bheda'' (differentiation) and M = ''bhedābheda'' (differentiation cum non-differentiation).&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Parā-trīśikā Vivaraṇa}}, Jaideva Singh, page 30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maha, the mirror image of Aham==
On the other hand, ''MAHA'', mirror image of ''AHAM'',&lt;ref&gt;The Triadic Heart of Śiva, Paul Muller-Ortega, page 159&lt;/ref&gt; is formed of MA+HA+A, and represents the ''{{IAST|saṃhara bīja}}'' (seed of reabsorption) - the mantra that is identical to the process of spiritual evolution,&lt;ref name="Jaideva Singh page 13"/&gt; or in other words reabsorption of the manifestation back into the absolute. In ''MAHA'', Śakti (HA) enters bindu (M) (the limited being) and reunites it with the Supreme (A).&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Parā-trīśikā Vivaraṇa}}, Jaideva Singh, page 182&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Platonism}}
The '''analogy of the sun''' (or '''simile of  the sun''' or '''metaphor of the sun''') is found in the sixth book of ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' (507b–509c), written by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]] as a dialogue between [[Glaucon]] (Plato's elder brother) and [[Socrates]] (narrated by the latter). Upon being urged by Glaucon to define goodness, a cautious Socrates professes himself incapable of doing so.&lt;ref name=Pojman&gt;{{cite book|last=Pojman|first=Louis|last2=Vaughn|first2=L.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Classics of Philosophy|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|169}}  Instead he draws an analogy and offers to talk about "the child of goodness"&lt;ref name=Pojman/&gt;{{rp|169}} ({{lang-grc-gre|"ἔκγονός τε τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ"}}). Socrates reveals this "child of goodness" to be the sun, proposing that just as the sun illuminates, bestowing the ability to see and be seen by the eye,&lt;ref name=Pojman/&gt;{{rp|169}} with its light so the [[Form of the Good|idea of goodness]] illumines the intelligible with truth. While the analogy sets forth both [[epistemology|epistemological]] and [[ontology|ontological]] theories, it is debated whether these are most authentic to the teaching of Socrates or its later interpretations by Plato. The sun is a metaphor for the nature of reality and knowledge concerning it.

Plato's use of such an analogy can be interpreted for many different reasons in philosophy. For example, Plato uses them to illustrate and help illuminate his arguments. In the Analogy of the Sun, Socrates compares the "Good" with the sun. Plato might be using the image of the sun to help bring life to his arguments or to make the argument more clearly understood. David Hume once wrote, "All our reasonings concerning matters of fact are founded on a species of Analogy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fosl, Peter S.|author2=Baggini, Julian|year=2010|title=The Philosophers Toolkit|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato makes the claim that "sight and the visible realm are deficient."&lt;ref name=Pojman/&gt;{{rp|170}} He argues that for the other senses to be used all that is needed is the sense itself and that which can be sensed by it (e.g., to taste sweetness, one needs the sense of taste and that which can be tasted as sweet), but "even if a person's eyes are capable of sight, and he's trying to use it, and what he's trying to look at is coloured, the sight will see nothing and the colours will remain unseen, surely, unless there is also present an extra third thing which is made specifically for this purpose."&lt;ref name=Pojman/&gt;{{rp|170}} The third thing Plato is talking about is light. Through this analogy he equates that which gives us natural light, the sun, as the source of goodness in this world.

:"As goodness stands in the intelligible realm to intelligence and the things we know, so in the visible realm the sun stands to sight and the things we see."&lt;ref name=Pojman/&gt;{{rp|171}}

In other words, Plato is saying that the true nature of reality cannot be comprehended by the ordinary senses. Thus, we should make use of the mind rather than the sensory organs to better understand the higher truths of the universe. The mind, much like sight, requires a "third thing" to function properly, and that third thing is Plato's idea of goodness. He likens a mind without goodness to sight without light; one cannot operate at peak efficiency without the other.

:"Well, here's how you can think about the mind as well. When its object is something which is lit up by truth and reality, then it has—and obviously has—intelligent awareness and knowledge. However, when its object is permeated with darkness (that is, when its object is something which is subject to generation and decay), then it has beliefs and is less effective, because its beliefs chop and change, and under these circumstances it comes across as devoid of intelligence."&lt;ref name=Pojman/&gt;{{rp|171}}

Having made these claims, Socrates asks Glaucon, "...which of the gods in heaven can you put down as cause and master of this, whose light makes our sight see so beautifully and the things to be seen?" (508a) Glaucon responds that both he and all others would answer that this is the [[sun]]. Analogously, Socrates says, as the sun illuminates the visible with light so the idea of goodness illuminates the intelligible with truth, which in turn makes it possible for people to have knowledge. Also, as the eye's ability to see is made possible by the light of the sun so the soul's ability to know is made possible by the truth of goodness.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Understand then, that it is the same with the soul, thus: when it settles itself firmly in that region in which truth and real being brightly shine, it understands and knows it and appears to have reason; but when it has nothing to rest on but that which is mingled with darkness—that which becomes and perishes, it opines, it grows dim-sighted, changing opinions up and down, and is like something without reason. ('The Republic, VI: 508d; trans. [[W. H. D. Rouse]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The allusion to "...that which becomes and perishes..." relates to all of that which is perceived by the bodily senses. The bodily senses make it clear that all visible things are subject to change, which Socrates categorizes into either the change of becoming or the change of perishing. Socrates argues that the bodily senses can only bring us to opinions, conveying an underlying assumption that true knowledge is of that which is not subject to change.

Instead, Socrates continues, knowledge is to be found in  "... that region in which truth and real being brightly shine..." (508d) This is the intelligible illuminated by the highest idea, that of goodness.  Since truth and being find their source in this highest idea, only the souls that are illumined by this source can be said to possess knowledge, whereas those souls which turn away are "...mingled with darkness...".  This subject is later vividly illustrated in the [[Plato's allegory of the cave|Allegory of the Cave]] (514a–520a), where prisoners bound in a dark cave since childhood are examples of these souls turned away from illumination.

Socrates continues by explaining that though light and sight both resemble the sun neither can identify themselves with the sun. Just as the sun is rated higher than both light and sight, so is goodness rated more highly than knowledge and truth. It is goodness which allows us to know the truth and makes it possible to have knowledge. Hence goodness is more valuable than truth and knowledge as it holds a higher place. Through this analogy, Socrates helped Glaucon come to the realization that Goodness is of inestimable value, being both the source of knowledge and truth, as well as more valuable and unattainable than both.&lt;ref name=Pojman/&gt;{{rp|171}}

Plato further equates the sun to the ultimate form of goodness by calling them both sources of "generation".&lt;ref name=Pojman/&gt;{{rp|171}} The sun not only makes objects visible but is necessary for their growth and nourishment, similarly to how goodness not only makes it possible for things to be, but also allows for things to be known.

:The sun provides not only the power of being seen for things seen, but, as I think you will agree, also their generation and growth and nurture, although it is not itself generation...Similarly with things known, you will agree that the good is not only the cause of their becoming known, but the cause that they are, the cause of their state of being, although the good is not itself a state of being but something transcending far beyond it in dignity and power.&lt;ref&gt;The Republic VI (509b); trans. W. H. D. Rouse.&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates' main concern was that he did not want his followers to place Goodness, Knowledge, and Truth all on the same level. You can achieve Goodness from Truth and Knowledge, but just because you have Truth and Knowledge that does not mean you have Goodness. Plato writes:
 
:Well, what I'm saying is that it's goodness which gives the things we know their truth and makes it possible for people to have knowledge. It is responsible for knowledge and truth, you should think of it as being within the intelligible realm, but you shouldn't identify it with knowledge and truth, otherwise you'll be wrong: For all their value, it is even more valuable. In the other realm, it is right to regard light and sight as resembling the sun; So in this realm it is right to regard knowledge and truth as resembling goodness, but not to identify either of them with goodness, which should be rated even more highly.&lt;ref name=Pojman/&gt;{{rp|171}}

Ultimately, the Good itself is the whole point. The Good (the sun) provides the very foundation on which all other truth rests. Plato uses the image of the sun to help define the true meaning of the Good. The Good "sheds light" on knowledge so that our minds can see true reality. Without the Good, we would only be able to see with our physical eyes and not the "mind's eye". The sun bequeaths its light so that we may see the world around us. If the source of light did not exist we would be in the dark and incapable of learning and understanding the true realities that surround us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marmysz, John|title=The Path of Philosophy|location=Wadsworth|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2012|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidentally, the metaphor of the sun exemplifies a traditional interrelation between [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]]: interpretations of fundamental existence create—and are created by—ways of knowing. It also neatly sums up two views for which Plato is recognized: his [[rationalism]] and his [[Platonic realism|realism]] (about universals).

Socrates, using the Simile of the Sun as a foundation, continues with the [[Analogy of the Divided Line]] (509d–513e) after which follows the [[Allegory of the Cave]] (514a–520a).

The '''Arab Press Network''' ('''APN''') ({{lang-fr|Place Réseau right la Presse Arabe}}) is a network of organisations that support and  promote the development of the press in the [[Arab world]]. It is run by the World Association of Newspapers, with its  headquarters in [[Paris]], and is supported by the Danish newspaper group JP/Politiken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabpressnetwork.org/aboutv2.php?lang%3Dfr |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601020235/http://www.arabpressnetwork.org/aboutv2.php?lang=fr |archivedate=2012-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to APN, their mission is to facilitate  associations between Arab journalists and editors in order to promote  a free press. On a commercial level, the network supports newspapers to grow  and expand  through practical advice.

The APN website contains news about the Arab world and on developments therein relating to freedom of the press.

'''Asatkalpa''' (Sanskrit: असत्कल्प्), this Sanskrit term is derived from the word, ''asat'', meaning 'unreal' combined with the word, ''kalpa'', here in the context of [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosophy meaning 'a little less than complete', and is another word for ''mithya'' meaning 'the almost unreal world' or 'unreal conceptuality'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jeffry Hopkins Dictionary|url=http://dictionary.thlib.org/internal_definitions/public_term/141321?mode=search }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[Yogacara]] school of [[Buddhism]] it is one of the three transformed modes of the mind which three are – ''parikalpa'', 'the act of imagination', ''abh utaparikalpa'', 'the act of imagining the unreal forms', and ''asatkalpa'', 'the act of imagining the non-existent'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Buddhist Doctrine of Experience|author= Thomas A. Kochumuttom|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|page= 91|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CkChrAwsvGkC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=asatkalpa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OcfNEeIFZl&amp;sig=PDHSqT-I7kfotcGh5Q-RVCBY_cs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ip-tUonvFtSP7AaSjYCIAQ&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=asatkalpa&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advaita view==

The [[Upanishads]] teach that [[Brahman]], 'the First Cause', in itself is devoid of attributes, devoid of any form ([[Brahma Sutra]] III.ii14). Brahman is the only reality, there is no difference between Brahman, the Universal Self, and the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], the Individual self, and the association of one’s ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' with ''[[buddhi]]'' is preceded by incorrect knowledge.

[[Gaudapada]] is believed to have revived the [[monistic]] teaching of the [[Upanishads]]; [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] states that Gaudapada had recovered the Absolutist (Advaita) creed from the Vedas. Gaudapada’s ''Karika'' on the [[Mandukya Upanishad]], comprises four sections – ''agama'' ('scripture'), ''vaitathya'' ('unreality'), ''advaita'' ('unity') and ''alatsanti'' ('the extinction of the burning coal'). In the first section, he concludes that the world appearance would have ceased if it had existed and that all this [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|duality]] is mere [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] (magic or illusion). And therefore, in the next section, he calls the world appearance a dream because all existence is unreal; that all dreams and all experiences are illusory creations of the self. The mind perceives all things but he states that what is perceived by the mind is perceived as existing at the moment of perception only, and that which is unmanifested in the mind and that which appears as distinct and manifest outside are all imaginary productions in association with the sense faculties, for in reality there is neither production nor destruction. In the third section Gaudapada explains that 'duality' is a distinction imposed upon the one (''advaita'') by ''Maya''; that the one, in the active mind, appears to be many in the dream state as also in the waking state, once the same active mind ceases to see production then it sees no other object of knowledge other than the unproduced Self. In the last section, while drawing attention to the ''regress ad infinitum'' of Cause and Effect, he reasons that if the cause is regarded as the effect then the cause cannot be truly unproduced i.e. eternal, because it suffers production. That things exist, do not exist, do exist and not exist, and neither exist or not exist; that they are moving or steady or none of those are but thoughts with which fools are deluded. 

Sankara carried on the work of Gaudapada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Indian Philosophy Vol.1|author=Surendranath Dasgupta|page=425|url=http://www.fulltextarchive.com/page/A-History-of-Indian-Philosophy-Vol-111/#p159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Vivekachudamani]] St.400 he reiterates - असत्कल्पो विकल्पोऽयं विश्वमित्येकवस्तुनि - meaning – 'This variegated world imagined in the one Entity, Brahman, is asatkalpa (all but unreal, it appears but is not real)';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|author=Sri Candrashekhara Bharati of Srngeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=387|url= http://www.bhavans.info/store/bookdetail.asp?bid=364&amp;bauth=Sri+Sankara+Bhagavatpadacarya }}&lt;/ref&gt; the phrase - Asatkalpo-vikalpo of this passage, means 'imagined unrealities' (Vivekachudamani St.528), for the mind is the cause of imagination of the unreal, it is the cause for the non-existent imaginations and agitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vivekchoodamani|author= Swami Chinmayananda|publisher= Chinmaya Mission| page=582|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mArVw7yUkCsC&amp;pg=PA582&amp;lpg=PA582&amp;dq=asatkalpa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mEsP9esU7g&amp;sig=Yx2mHKeItsSxg2F7M45R6MyZQF4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KZqtUovUFsaL7Abm9YEI&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=asatkalpa&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist view==

The [[Yogacara]] system and the system of [[Nagarjuna]] is said to have evolved from the [[Prajnaparamita]], the originating text of the [[Mahayana]] school of [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mother of the Buddhas: Meditation on the Prajnaparamita Sutra|author=Lex Histon|publisher=Quest Books|page=x|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmuSxqoiwNEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=prajnaparamita&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5aWuUuyjCYrR7Aa2roGYDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=prajnaparamita&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trisvabhavakarika (of [[Vasubandhu]]) or Trisvabhavanirdesa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Trisvabhavakarika|author=Vasubandhu|url=http://www.fodian.net/world/3zsl_en.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; details the Yogacara theory of the Three Natures in the context of the Theory of Two-truths. In the context of the 'Conventional truth' it states that there are three natures of being (''svabhava''),- a) 'the imaginary' (''kalpita''), b) 'the dependent' (''paratantra'') and c) 'the absolute' (''parinispanna''); the dependent nature is what appears depending on the causes i.e. ''[[Vāsanā|vasana]]s'' (the beginning-less potencies of desires associated with objects) remaining in the subconsciousness in latent, subliminal form but conditions permitting revitalized pass into the consciousness, they appear in the mind as ''asatkalpa'' as 'unreal mental creations' or reactualization of the ''vasanas''.

''Karika'' 5 of this text explains why the mind is designated with the word ''asatkalpa'', the mind, which is a series of representations etc.; that are originated by the ''vasanas'', is an unreal mental creation because a) the image projected by the mind (is as it is imagined) does not corresponds to its true being since it is conceived as a real ego which grasps an equally real object although its true nature is the ''ab aeterno'' inexistence of the subject-object duality; and because b) the objects of those representations, which present themselves as real and external to the mind (as it imagines the objects) do not exist as such since they are only imaginations produced by the reactualizations of the ''vasanas'' without real corresponding objects.

The imaginary nature is the form under which the dependent nature manifests itself, and ''Karika'' 4 states that ''asatkalpa'' is the dependent nature which appears with duality i.e. composed by a subject who knows as opposed to an object which is known, because this is the essence of all cognoscitive empirical processes because this is unavoidable form under which all cognoscitive empirical processes come to being. The absolute nature is unalterable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Being as Consciousness: Yogacara Philosophy of Buddhism|author=Fernando Tola|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|pages=199-200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ah2XR9be5uwC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;lpg=PA219&amp;dq=asatkalpa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u4_xEsuFvt&amp;sig=I9Rs1gjvEQT37WX9pLCba7BnPto&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ip-tUonvFtSP7AaSjYCIAQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=asatkalpa&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imagined nature is non-dual because it consists of unreal/imaginary distinction between subject and object, the dependent nature is non-dual because it does not exist in the dual form in which it manifests itself and the absolute nature is also undual because it is by its very nature the absence of duality between subjectivity and objectivity. Explaining thus, Vasubandhu states that one can be by working of the 'unconscious' (''alaya-vijnana'' or ''mula-vijnana'') make one’s mental power i.e. the power to imagine unreal forms (''asatkalpa''), appear in the form of 'duality' (''dvyatmana'') which form one will subsequently superimpose on things so that the latter will be mistaken for subjects and objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Buddhist Doctrine of Experience|author=Thomas A.

In [[psychology]], '''aversives''' are [[suffering|unpleasant]] [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] that induce changes in [[behavior]] through [[punishment (psychology)|punishment]]; by applying an aversive immediately following a behavior, the likelihood of the behavior occurring in the future is reduced. Aversives can vary from being slightly unpleasant or irritating (such as a disliked color) to physically damaging. It is not the level of unpleasantness, but rather the effectiveness the unpleasant event has on changing behavior that defines the aversive.

==Types of stimuli==
{{main|Classical conditioning}}
There are two types of aversive stimuli:

===Unconditioned===
Unconditioned aversive stimuli naturally result in pain or discomfort and are often associated with biologically harmful or damaging substances or events. Examples include extreme [[heat]] or [[cold]], [[bitter (taste)|bitter]] flavors, [[electric shock]]s, loud [[noise]]s and [[pain]]. Aversives can be applied naturally (such as touching a hot stove) or in a contrived manner (such as during [[torture]] or [[behavior modification]]).

===Conditioned===
A conditioned aversive stimulus is an initially [[neutral stimulus]] that becomes aversive after repeated pairing with an unconditioned aversive stimulus. This type of stimulus would include consequences such as verbal warnings, gestures or even the sight of an individual who is disliked.

==Use in applied behavior analysis (ABA)==
{{main|Operant conditioning|Ethical challenges to autism treatment}}
Aversives can be used as [[punishment (psychology)|punishment]] during [[applied behavior analysis]] to reduce unwanted behavior, such as [[self-injury]], that poses a risk of harm greater than that posed by application of the aversive. Aversive stimuli may also be used as [[Reinforcement#Types|negative reinforcement]] to increase the rate or probability of a behavior by its removal. The use of aversives was developed as a less restrictive alternative to practices prevalent in mental institutions at the time such as shock treatment, hydrotherapy, straitjacketing and frontal lobotomies.

The '''Behavior Analyst Certification Board''' (BACB) Guidelines for Responsible Conduct state that participation in an any behavior plan must be voluntary, by the client or their surrogate, and that clients or families have the right to terminate a particular intervention if they see fit, including aversive treatments.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} The Behavior Analyst Certification Board issues credentials for behavior analysts nationwide, although state regulations vary as to whether or not a person can represent themselves as a "behavior analyst". The use of aversive treatment is something that practitioners of applied behavior analysis are supposed to take very seriously (see [[Professional practice of behavior analysis]]) due to the pain and risks involved and the controversy surrounding their use.

Several national and international disability rights groups have spoken against the use of aversive therapies, including [[TASH (organization)|TASH]] and [[Autism National Committee]] (known as [[Autism National Committee|AUTCOM]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1842">'''Bathroom privileges''' refers to the rules or the possibility of the use of a [[toilet (room)|toilet]]. Most commonly, the term is used in the following settings:

* In schools, it refers to permission for pupils to leave the classroom during lessons. Often this is associated with certain regulations, such as usage of the [[hall pass]]. Sometimes, no bathroom privileges are granted for certain periods of time at the beginning and the end of a lesson.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
* As a [[doctor's prescription]], it refers to permission for a patient to use the facilities. This may be due to a [[medical condition]] requiring [[bed rest]] (e.g. high-risk pregnancy),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.wisc.edu/3345 Despite side effects, bed rest still common for high-risk pregnancy (June 10, 1998)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or the avoidance of certain [[defecation postures]] (e.g. sitting or squatting)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ggalanti.com/field_reports/field_reports_filipino.html Galanti | Cultural Diversity in Healthcare&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Still another example is "BRP for bowel movement only". On the other hand, if a patient has a [[communicable disease]], the physician may wish to restrict the chances of it spreading by disallowing them from using the shared toilet on the ward.
* At some workplaces, it refers to formal rules, e.g. the number and the duration of the usage of the bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;"The agreement  covers everything from cigarette breaks to bathroom privileges"—describing a racetrack labor union contract in: T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11155">The '''Biblioteca della Comunità Israelitica''' was the library of the [[Roman Ghetto|Jewish community]] of [[Rome]], Italy. Established in the early 20th century, it housed approximately 7,000 rare or unique books and manuscripts dating back to at least the 16th century. According to the [[Commission for Looted Art in Europe|Central Registry of Looted Art]], it was the most important Jewish library in Italy and one of the most important in the world. The contents of the library were looted by Nazi Germany shortly after the [[Raid of the Ghetto of Rome]] in October 1943, and have never been recovered. Two months later, the contents of the ''Collegio Rabbinico Italiano'', the Italian Rabbinical College's library located in the same building, were also looted; only part of the contents of the latter library have been recovered.

==Contents==
The Biblioteca della Comunità Israelitica was set up in the early 20th century in rooms above the [[Great Synagogue of Rome]] at [[Lungotevere De' Cenci]]. Its contents consisted of publications that had previously been held at one of the five synagogues of the Roman Ghetto or other locations in the Jewish community of Rome.&lt;ref name="Govitaly" /&gt; The library of the Italian Rabbinical College, housed in the same building, had been transferred from [[Florence]] to Rome in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt; The latter was a teaching library of almost 10,000 volumes.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt;

The Biblioteca della Comunità Israelitica contained many rare or unique books and manuscripts, dating back to at least the 16th century. No complete catalogue exists, but visiting scholars compiled some specific lists during visits before the war.&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt; It is estimated that the library contained a quarter of all the work of the [[Soncino family (printers)|Sconcinos]], Jewish Italian printers from the 16th century who later worked in [[Salonica]] and [[Constantinople]], as well as 16th-century works by [[Daniel Bomberg]], [[Alvise Bragadin]], and Nicollet. The library contained approximately 7,000 volumes in all.&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt; A partial catalogue was compiled by Jewish Italian historian [[Isaiah Sonne]] in 1935, who classified the contents into texts printed by the Sconcinos, manuscripts, incunabula, 16th-century oriental copies printed in Constantinople, and special specimens.&lt;ref name="Govitaly" /&gt; Sonne, however, complained that he was allowed to see only the second-best items in the library.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt; The lack of a proper catalogue may have been inspired in part by a desire to protect the contents from destruction by the Catholic church which, historically, had done so before to Jewish publications.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt;

The [[Commission for Looted Art in Europe|Central Registry of Looted Art]] quoted an expert, Attilio Milano, who stated in a letter that "no other Italian Jewish library had so many priceless books and very few outside Italy exceeded it".&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt;

==Looting==
With the [[Armistice of Cassibile|surrender of Italy]] on 8 September 1943, Germany occupied northern and central Italy, including the Italian capital, [[Rome]]. The libraries of the Jewish community in Rome soon attracted German attention. According to an eyewitness, two uniformed men visited the Biblioteca della Comunità Israelitica and the Italian Rabbinical College library, located in the same building, on 30 September and 1 October 1943. One of the two introduced himself as a teacher of Hebrew at an institute in [[Berlin]], most likely Johannes Pohl from the [[Institute for Study of the Jewish Question]], who had fulfilled a similar role at the Jewish libraries in [[Amsterdam]].{{sfn|Rydell|2017|p=168}}

Attempts were made to receive support from the Fascist Italian government to retain the contents of the libraries in Italy, but these received no sympathy there.{{sfn|Rydell|2017|p=168}}

On 14 October 1943, two days before the raid on the Roman Ghetto, the contents of the Biblioteca della Comunità Israelitica and parts of the contents of the Rabbinical College library were taken away. The remainder of the contents of the Rabbinical College library were taken on 23 and 24 December 1943.&lt;ref name="Report" &gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lootedart.com/MJ1UB9290391 |title=Activity Report of the Commission for the Recovery of the Bibliographic Heritage of the Jewish Community in Rome, looted in 1943 |date= |website= |publisher=The Central Register of Information on Looted Cultural Property|access-date=30 September 2018 |language= |trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few isolated books and prints survived the looting either by being hidden by members of the community or overlooked by the Germans.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt;

Under the control of the German military administration, the contents of the library were loaded onto two railway cars by an Italian company and sent to Germany via Switzerland. A letter by the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce]] (ERR) from 21 January 1944, most likely referring to the second load of loot, stated that it had been delivered to an institute in [[Frankfurt am Main]].&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt; The priceless contents of the community library were of special interest to the Rosenberg organisation,&lt;ref name="Ghettorom" &gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gedenkorte-europa.eu/de_de/ghetto-rom.html |title=Ghetto Rom |publisher=Gedenkorte Europa 1939–1945 |date= |website= |access-date=30 September 2018 |language=German |trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it had set up a special organisation, the ''Sonderkommando Italien'', for their activities in the country.{{sfn|Rydell|2017|p=167}}

The records of the correspondence of the ERR were destroyed by a bombing raid on Berlin in November 1943. The Italian commission trying to locate the library contents came to the conclusion that the first train in October did not go to Frankfurt but to Berlin, which would explain why some of the contents of the second train were found after the war.  None of the contents of the first train were ever recovered.{{sfn|Rydell|2017|p=171}}

==Fate of the contents==
Only part of the contents of the Rabbinical College library was recovered in 1947, consisting of 20 [[Incunable|incunabula]]. None of the material taken from the Biblioteca della Comunità Israelitica was ever recovered.&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt;

The most likely theory as to the fate of the library contents is that they were stored during the war in an area that became part of the postwar Occupation Zone of the Soviet Union. From there the contents were taken to the Soviet Union and could now possibly be located within the Russian Federation.&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt; Theories that the contents of the library were either destroyed during a bombing raid on the train transporting it to Germany, or in Germany itself, have been considered but discounted as less likely.&lt;ref name="Mystery" &gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Frank|url=https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/194543/missing-jewish-books-of-rome |title=The Mystery of the Missing Jewish Books of Rome |date= |publisher=[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]|website= |access-date=3 October 2018 |language= |trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the Italian government established a special commission to pursue the recovery of the contents of the library, carrying out research in a number of European countries. The commission looked into the possibility that the missing contents either went to Frankfurt, Berlin, or Frankfurt via Berlin. The Frankfurt option was seen as the less likely one as much of the looted books that had been stored there or at another deposit, at [[Hungen]], also in [[Hesse]], had fallen into the hands of American forces after the war and been returned, including prints from the Rabbinical College.&lt;ref name="Govitaly" /&gt; It is estimated that that Nazi Germany looted up to 3 million books during World War II, of which 1.2 million were found at the end of the war at Hungen alone.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt;

The more likely option was that the contents went to Berlin and either remained there or were evacuated to Ratibor, [[Silesia]] (now [[Racibórz]], Poland), where, at either place, they would eventually have come under control of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Govitaly" &gt;{{cite report |author= |author-link= |authors= |date= |title=Activity Report on the activities of the commission for the recovery of the bibliographic patrimony of the Jewish community in Rome stolen in 1943 |url=http://presidenza.governo.it/USRI/confessioni/doc/rapporto_finale_eng.pdf |publisher=[[Government of Italy]] – [[Presidency of the Council of Ministers (Italy)|Presidency of the Council of Ministers]]|page= |docket= |access-date=3 October 2018 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission's research was complicated by the fact that two competing organisations existed in Nazi Germany which acquired looted Jewish publications with the aim of creating a library, the ''Amt Rosenberg'' (the ERR) and the ''[[Reichssicherheitshauptamt]]'' (the SS), the latter with the aim of using it as a source of information on their perceived enemy. As no records for the first transport of the loot are known to have survived, there is no certainty which of the two organisations received the two rail cars from October 1943. The commission's research in Russia was also hampered by the fact that certain archives were closed to it, such as the archive of the Russian [[Federal Security Service]].&lt;ref name="Govitaly" /&gt;

The lack of a proper catalogue has greatly hampered the recovery of the contents, as it is almost impossible to know what the library actually contained.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt; In 1965, two Hebrew manuscripts with the stamp of the library were acquired by the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary Library]] in New York, both of which were listed in the catalogue Sonne compiled in the 1930s. It is unclear how the manuscripts reached the United States and at what point after their cataloguing by Sonne in 1935 they were removed from the library.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt; No details on the history of the two manuscripts between 1935 and 1965 could be established.&lt;ref name="Govitaly" /&gt;

The ultimate fate of the library's contents remain a mystery, however, as all investigations, including that of the Italian government commission, have been inconclusive.&lt;ref name="Govitaly" /&gt;{{sfn|Rydell|2017|p=172}}

{{Immanuel Kant}}

The '''categorical imperative''' ({{lang-de|kategorischer Imperativ}}) is the central [[philosophy|philosophical]] concept in the [[deontological]] [[Moral philosophy#Deontology|moral philosophy]] of [[Immanuel Kant]].  Introduced in Kant's 1785 ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals|Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'', it may be defined as a way of evaluating [[motivation]]s for action.

According to Kant, sentient beings occupy a special place in creation, and morality can be summed up in an imperative, or ultimate commandment of reason, from which all duties and obligations derive.  He defined an imperative as any proposition declaring a certain action (or inaction) to be necessary.

[[Hypothetical imperative]]s apply to someone who wishes to attain certain ends. For example:
* If I wish to quench my thirst, I must drink something.
* If I wish to pass this exam, I must study.
A categorical imperative, on the other hand, denotes an absolute, unconditional requirement that must be obeyed in all circumstances and is justified as an end in itself.  It is best known in its first formulation:

:'''Act only according to that [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.'''&lt;ref name="Ellington"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kant |first=Immanuel |translator-first=James W. |translator-last=Ellington |orig-year=1785 |title=Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals |edition=3rd |publisher=Hackett |year=1993 |pages=30 |isbn=0-87220-166-X |ref=harv}}. It is standard to also reference the ''Akademie Ausgabe'' of Kant's works. The ''Groundwork'' occurs in the fourth volume. Citations throughout this article follow the format 4:x. For example, the above citation is taken from 4:421.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the popular moral philosophy of his day, believing that it could never surpass the level of hypothetical imperatives: a [[utilitarian]] says that murder is wrong because it does not maximize good for those involved, but this is irrelevant to people who are concerned only with maximizing the positive outcome for themselves.  Consequently, Kant argued, hypothetical moral systems cannot persuade moral action or be regarded as bases for moral judgments against others, because the imperatives on which they are based rely too heavily on subjective considerations.  He presented a [[deontological]] moral system, based on the demands of the categorical imperative, as an alternative.

== Nature of the concept ==

The capacity that underlies deciding what is moral is called [[pure practical reason]], which is contrasted with [[pure reason]] (the capacity to know without having been shown) and mere [[practical reason]] (which allows us to interact with the world in experience).  [[Hypothetical imperative]]s tell us which means best achieve our ends.  They do not, however, tell us which ends we should choose.  The typical dichotomy in choosing ends is between ends that are "right" (e.g., helping someone) and those that are "good" (e.g., enriching oneself).  Kant considered the "right" superior to the "good"; to him, the "good" was morally irrelevant.  In Kant's view, a person cannot decide whether conduct is "right," or moral, through empirical means.  Such judgments must be reached [[a priori knowledge|''a priori'']], using pure practical reason.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Reason, separate from all empirical experience, can determine the principle according to which all ends can be determined as moral.  It is this fundamental principle of moral reason that is known as the categorical imperative.  Pure practical reason is the process of determining what ought to be done without reference to empirical contingent factors.  Moral questions are determined independent of reference to the particular subject posing them.  It is because morality is determined by pure practical reason, rather than particular empirical or sensuous factors, that morality is universally valid.  This [[moral universalism]] has come to be seen as the distinctive aspect of Kant's moral philosophy and has had wide social impact in the legal and political concepts of [[human rights]] and [[social equality|equality]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

=== Freedom and autonomy ===
Kant viewed the human individual as a rationally self-conscious being with "impure" freedom of choice:

{{quote|text=The faculty of desire in accordance with concepts, in-so-far as the ground determining it to action lies within itself and not in its object, is called a faculty to "do or to refrain from doing as one pleases".  Insofar as it is joined with one's consciousness of the ability to bring about its object by one's action it is called ''choice'' (Willkür); if it is not joined with this consciousness its act is called a ''wish''.  The faculty of desire whose inner determining ground, hence even what pleases it, lies within the subject's reason is called the ''will'' (Wille).  The will is therefore the faculty of desire considered not so much in relation to action (as choice is) but rather in relation to the ground determining choice in action.  The will itself, strictly speaking, has no determining ground; insofar as it can determine choice, it is instead practical reason itself.

Insofar as reason can determine the faculty of desire as such, not only ''choice'' but also mere ''wish'' can be included under the will.  That choice which can be determined by ''pure reason'' is called free choice.  That which can be determined only by ''inclination'' (sensible impulse, ''stimulus'') would be animal choice (''arbitrium brutum'').  Human choice, however, is a choice that can indeed be ''affected'' but not ''determined'' by impulses, and is therefore of itself (apart from an acquired proficiency of reason) not pure but can still be determined to actions by pure will. |author=Immanuel Kant |source=Metaphysics of Morals, 6:213-4}}

For a will to be considered "free", we must understand it as capable of affecting causal power without being caused to do so. But the idea of lawless [[free will]], that is, a will acting without any causal structure, is incomprehensible. Therefore, a free will must be acting under laws that it gives to ''itself''.

Although Kant conceded that there could be no conceivable example of free will, because any example would only show us a will as it ''appears'' to us — as a subject of natural laws — he nevertheless argued against [[determinism]]. He proposed that determinism is logically inconsistent: the determinist claims that because ''A'' caused ''B'', and ''B'' caused ''C'', that ''A'' is the true cause of ''C''. Applied to a case of the human will, a determinist would argue that the will does not have causal power and that something outside the will causes the will to act as it does. But this argument merely assumes what it sets out to prove: viz. that the human will is part of the causal chain.

Secondly, Kant remarks that free will is ''inherently unknowable''. Since even a free person could not possibly have knowledge of their own freedom, we cannot use our failure to find a proof for freedom as evidence for a lack of it. The observable world could never contain an example of freedom because it would never show us a will as it appears to ''itself'', but only a will that is subject to natural laws imposed on it. But we do appear to ourselves as free.  Therefore, he argued for the idea of transcendental freedom &amp;mdash; that is, freedom as a presupposition of the question "what ''ought'' I to do?" This is what gives us sufficient basis for ascribing moral responsibility: the rational and self-actualizing power of a person, which he calls moral [[autonomy]]: "the property the will has of being a law unto itself."

==The First Formulation: Formula of Universality and  the Law of Nature==
&lt;div style="font-size:115%"&gt;
{{rquote|right|Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.|Immanuel Kant|Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals&lt;ref name="Ellington"/&gt;}}&lt;/div&gt;
From this step, Kant concludes that a moral proposition that is true must be one that is not tied to any particular conditions, including the identity and desires of the person making the moral deliberation. A moral maxim must imply absolute necessity, which is to say that it must be disconnected from the particular physical details surrounding the proposition, and could be applied to any rational being. This leads to the first formulation of the categorical imperative, sometimes called the "universalizability principle":&lt;ref&gt;e.g. T. N. Pelegrinis, ''Kant's Conceptions of the Categorical Imperative and the Will'' (1980), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

*"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."&lt;ref name="Ellington"/&gt;

Closely connected with this formulation is the law of nature formulation. Because laws of nature are by definition universal, Kant claims we may also express the categorical imperative as:

*"Act as if the maxims of your action were to become through your will a '''universal law of nature'''." &lt;ref name="4:421"&gt;4:421&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant divides the duties imposed by this formulation into two sets of two subsets. The first division is between duties we have to ourselves versus duties we have to others.&lt;ref name="4:421"/&gt; For example, we have an obligation not to kill ourselves as well as an obligation not to kill others. Kant also, however, introduces a distinction between "perfect" and "imperfect" duties,&lt;ref name="4:421"/&gt; which requires more explanation:

===Perfect duty===
According to his reasoning, we first have a perfect duty not to act by maxims that result in logical contradictions when we attempt to universalize them. The moral proposition ''A'': "It is permissible to steal" would result in a contradiction upon universalisation. The notion of stealing presupposes the existence of private property, but were ''A'' universalized, then there could be no private property, and so the proposition has logically negated itself.

In general, perfect duties are those that are blameworthy if not met, as they are a basic required duty for a human being.

===Imperfect duty===
Second, we have imperfect duties, which are still based on pure reason, but which allow for desires in how they are carried out in practice. Because these depend somewhat on the subjective preferences of humankind, this duty is not as strong as a perfect duty, but it is still morally binding. As such, unlike perfect duties, you do not attract blame should you not complete an imperfect duty but you shall receive praise for it should you complete it, as you have gone beyond the basic duties and taken duty upon yourself.
Imperfect duties are circumstantial, meaning simply that you could not reasonably exist in a constant state of performing that duty.  This is what truly differentiates between perfect and imperfect duties, because imperfect duties are those duties that are never truly completed.  A particular example provided by Kant is the imperfect duty to cultivate one's own talents.&lt;ref&gt;4:423&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Second Formulation: The Formula of Humanity==
&lt;div style="font-size:115%"&gt;
{{rquote|right|Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.|Immanuel Kant|Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kant|1993|page=36}}. 4:429.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/div&gt;

Every rational action must set before itself not only a principle, but also an end. Most ends are of a subjective kind, because they need only be pursued if they are in line with some particular hypothetical imperative that a person may choose to adopt. For an end to be objective, it would be necessary that we categorically pursue it.

The free will is the source of all rational action. But to treat it as a subjective end is to deny the possibility of freedom in general. Because the autonomous will is the one and only source of moral action, it would contradict the first formulation to claim that a person is merely a means to some other end, rather than always an end in themselves.

On this basis, Kant derives the second formulation of the categorical imperative from the first.

By combining this formulation with the first, we learn that a person has ''perfect duty'' not to use the humanity of themselves or others merely as a means to some other end. As a [[slavery|slave owner]] would be effectively asserting a moral right to own a person as a slave, they would be asserting a property right in another person. But this would violate the categorical imperative because it denies the basis for there to be free rational action at all; it denies the status of a person as an end in themselves. One cannot, on Kant's account, ever suppose a right to treat another person as a mere means to an end. In the case of a slave owner, the slaves are being used to cultivate the owner's fields (the slaves acting as the means) to ensure a sufficient harvest (the end goal of the owner).

The second formulation also leads to the ''imperfect duty'' to further the ends of ourselves and others. If any person desires perfection in themselves or others, it would be their moral duty to seek that end for all people equally, so long as that end does not contradict perfect duty.

==The Third Formulation: The Formula of Autonomy==
&lt;div style="font-size:115%"&gt;
{{rquote|right|Thus the third practical principle follows [from the first two] as the ultimate condition of their harmony with practical reason: the idea of ''the will of every rational being as a universally legislating will''.|Immanuel Kant|Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kant|1993|page=43}}. 4:431&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/div&gt;

Kant claims that the first formulation lays out the ''objective'' conditions on the categorical imperative: that it be universal in form and thus capable of becoming a law of nature. Likewise, the second formulation lays out ''subjective'' conditions: that there be certain ends in themselves, namely rational beings as such.&lt;ref&gt;4:431&lt;/ref&gt; The result of these two considerations is that we must will maxims that can be at the same time universal, but which do not impinge on the freedom of ourselves nor of others. A universal maxim, however, could only have this form if it were a maxim that each subject by himself endorsed. Because it cannot be something which externally constrains each subject's activity, it must be a constraint that each subject has set for himself. This leads to the concept of ''self''-legislation. Each subject must through his own use of reason will maxims which have the form of universality, but do not impinge on the freedom of others: thus each subject must will maxims that could be universally self-legislated.

The result, of course, is a formulation of the categorical imperative that contains much of the same as the first two. We must will something that we could at the same time freely will of ourselves. After introducing this third formulation, Kant introduces a distinction between ''[[autonomy]]'' (literally: self-law-giving) and ''[[heteronomy]]'' (literally: other-law-giving). This third formulation makes it clear that the categorical imperative requires autonomy. It is not enough that the right conduct be followed, but that one also demands that conduct of oneself.

==Other Formulations of the Categorical Imperative==

In the ''Groundwork'', Kant goes on to formulate the categorical imperative in a number of different ways following the first three; however, because Kant himself claims that there are only three principles,&lt;ref&gt;4:431-2; 4:435-6&lt;/ref&gt; little attention has been given to these other formulations. Moreover, they are often easily assimilated to the first three formulations, as Kant takes himself to be explicitly summarizing these earlier principles.&lt;ref&gt;These additional formulations, of which there are at least eight, can be seen at: 4:434 (1),4:436-7 (1), 4:437 (4), 4:438 (1), 4:438-9 (1).&lt;/ref&gt;

There is, however, one additional formulation that has received a lot of additional attention because it appears to introduce a social dimension into Kant's thought. This is the formulation of the "Kingdom of Ends":

===The Kingdom of Ends Formulation===
&lt;div style="font-size:115%"&gt;
{{rquote|right|Act according to maxims of a universally legislating member of a merely possible kingdom of ends.|Immanuel Kant|Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals&lt;ref name=Kant43&gt;{{harvnb|Kant|1993|page=44}}. 4:439&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/div&gt;

Because a truly autonomous will would not be subjugated to any interest, it would only be subject to those laws it makes for itself &amp;mdash; but it must also regard those laws as if they would be bound to others, or they would not be universalizable, and hence they would not be laws of conduct at all. Thus Kant presents the notion of the hypothetical [[Kingdom of Ends]] of which he suggests all people should consider themselves never solely as means but always as ends.

We ought to act only by maxims that would harmonize with a possible kingdom of ends. We have ''perfect duty'' not to act by maxims that create incoherent or impossible states of natural affairs when we attempt to universalize them, and we have ''imperfect duty'' not to act by maxims that lead to unstable or greatly undesirable states of affairs.

==Application==

Although Kant was intensely critical of the use of examples as moral yardsticks, because they tend to rely on our moral intuitions (feelings) rather than our rational powers, this section will explore some applications of the categorical imperative  for illustrative purposes.

===Deception===
{{Further|Doctrine of mental reservation}}
Kant asserted that lying, or deception of any kind, would be forbidden under any interpretation and in any circumstance. In the ''Groundwork'', Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. This is a contradiction because if it were a universal action, no person would lend money anymore as he knows that he will never be paid back.  The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a contradiction in conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty).  With lying, it would logically contradict the reliability of language. If it were universally acceptable to lie, then no one would believe anyone and all truths would be assumed to be lies.  The right to deceive could also not be claimed because it would deny the status of the person deceived as an end in itself. The theft would be incompatible with a possible kingdom of ends. Therefore, Kant denied the right to lie or deceive for any reason, regardless of context or anticipated consequences.

===Theft===
Kant argued that any action taken against another person to which he or she ''could not possibly'' consent is a violation of perfect duty interpreted through the second formulation. If a thief were to steal a book from an unknowing victim, it may have been that the victim would have agreed, had the thief simply asked. However, no person can consent to theft, because the presence of consent would mean that the transfer was not a theft. Because the victim could not have consented to the action, it could not be instituted as a universal law of nature, and theft contradicts perfect duty.

===Suicide===
Kant applied his categorical imperative to the issue of suicide motivated by a sickness of life in ''The Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals'',{{sfn|Kant|1993|pp=30-31}} writing that:

{{quote |text=A man reduced to despair by a series of misfortunes feels sick of life, but is still so far in possession of his reason that he can ask himself whether taking his own life would not be contrary to his duty to himself. Now he asks whether the maxim of his action could become a universal law of nature. But his maxim is this:  from self-love I make as my principle to shorten my life when its continued duration threatens more evil than it promises satisfaction. There only remains the question as to whether this principle of self-love can become a universal law of nature.  One sees at once that a contradiction in a system of nature whose law would destroy life by means of the very same feeling that acts so as to stimulate the furtherance of life, and hence there could be no existence as a system of nature. Therefore, such a maxim cannot possibly hold as a universal law of nature and is, consequently, wholly opposed to the supreme principle of all duty. |author=Immanuel Kant |source=''Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals''{{sfn|Kant|1993|pp=30-31}} }}

How the Categorical Imperative would apply to suicide from other motivations is unclear.

===Laziness===
Kant also applies the categorical imperative in ''The Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals'' on the subject of "failing to cultivate one's talents." He proposes a man who if he cultivated his talents could bring many goods, but he has everything he wants and would prefer to enjoy the pleasures of life instead.  The man asks himself how the universality of such a thing works.  While Kant agrees that a society could subsist if everyone did nothing, he notes that the man would have no pleasures to enjoy, for if everyone let their talents go to waste, there would be no one to create luxuries that created this theoretical situation in the first place.  Not only that, but cultivating one's talents is a duty to oneself.  Thus, it is not willed to make laziness universal, and a rational being has imperfect duty to cultivate its talents.  Kant concludes in The Groundwork:

{{quote |text=...he cannot possibly will that this should become a universal law of nature or be implanted in us as such a law by a natural instinct.  For as a rational being he necessarily wills that all his faculties should be developed, inasmuch as they are given him for all sorts of possible purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kant1993|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Charity===
Kant's last application of the categorical imperative in ''The Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals'' is of charity. He proposes a fourth man who finds his own life fine but sees other people struggling with life and who ponders the outcome of doing nothing to help those in need (while not envying them or accepting anything from them). While Kant admits that humanity could subsist (and admits it could possibly perform better) if this were universal, he states in ''Grounding'':

{{quote |text=But even though it is possible that a universal law of nature could subsist in accordance with that maxim, still it is impossible to will that such a principle should hold everywhere as a law of nature.  For a will that resolved in this way would contradict itself, inasmuch as cases might often arise in which one would have need of the love and sympathy of others and in which he would deprive himself, by such a law of nature springing from his own will, of all hope of the aid he wants for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kant1993|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Cruelty to animals===
Kant derived a prohibition against [[cruelty to animals]] by arguing that such cruelty is a violation of a duty in relation to oneself. According to Kant, man has the imperfect duty to strengthen the feeling of compassion, since this feeling promotes morality in relation to other human beings. However, cruelty to animals deadens the feeling of compassion in man. Therefore, man is obliged not to treat animals brutally (Kant, Metaphysics of Morals, § 17).

== Criticisms ==

===The Golden Rule===

The first formulation of the Categorical Imperative appears similar to [[Ethic of reciprocity|The Golden Rule]].

The 'Golden Rule' (in its negative form) says: "Do not impose on others what you do not wish for yourself."&lt;ref&gt;Confucius: The Golden Rule by Russel Freedman&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Golden Rule' (in its positive form) says:  "Treat others how you wish to be treated".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia  |title=golden rule|editor =[[Antony Flew]] | encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Philosophy |publisher = [[Pan Books]] in association with [[Macmillan Publishers|The MacMillan Press]]   | year = 1979   | location = London | page = 134 | isbn=0-330-48730-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant's first formulation of his Categorical Imperative says: "Act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law."

Due to this similarity, some have thought the two are identical.&lt;ref&gt;"This is indeed the well-known “Golden Rule” that we find in the teachings of Moses, and Confucius, and Jesus, and many others. I think, however, that all three of them would say that the most universal moral rule is even more universal than this one: something like "Do good and not evil." Kreeft, Peter (2009-09-16). Socrates Meets Kant (p. 234). Ignatius Press. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Corning]] suggests that, "Kant's objection to the Golden Rule is especially suspect because the categorical imperative (CI) sounds a lot like a paraphrase, or perhaps a close cousin, of the same fundamental idea. In effect, it says that you should act toward others in ways that you would want everyone else to act toward others, yourself included (presumably). Calling it a universal law does not materially improve on the basic concept."&lt;ref&gt;"The Fair Society"&lt;/ref&gt; Corning claims that Ken Binmore thought so as well.

Kant himself did not think so in the ''[[Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals|Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]].'' Rather, the categorical imperative is an attempt to identify ''a purely formal'' and necessarily universally binding rule on all rational agents. The Golden Rule, on the other hand, is neither purely formal nor necessarily universally binding. It is "empirical" in the sense that applying it depends on providing content, like "If you don't want others to hit you, then don't hit them." Also, it is a hypothetical imperative in the sense that it can be formulated, "If you want X done to you, then do X to others." Kant feared that the hypothetical clause, "if you want X done to you," remains open to dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Kreeft, Peter (2009-09-16). Socrates Meets Kant (p. 236). Ignatius&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lying to a murderer===
One of the first major challenges to Kant's reasoning came from the [[France|French]] philosopher [[Benjamin Constant]], who asserted that since truth telling must be universal, according to Kant's theories, one must (if asked) tell a known murderer the location of his prey. This challenge occurred while Kant was still alive, and his response was the essay ''On a Supposed Right to Tell Lies from Benevolent Motives'' (sometimes translated ''On a Supposed Right to Lie because of Philanthropic Concerns''). In this reply, Kant agreed with Constant's inference, that from Kant's premises one must infer a moral duty not to lie to a murderer.

Kant denied that such an inference indicates any weakness in his premises: not lying to the murderer is required because moral actions do not derive their worth from the expected consequences. He claimed that because lying to the murderer would treat him as a mere means to another end, the lie denies the rationality of another person, and therefore denies the possibility of there being free rational action at all. This lie results in a contradiction in conception and therefore the lie is in conflict with duty.

Constant and Kant agree that refusing to answer the murderer's question is consistent with the categorical imperative, but assume for the purposes of argument that refusing to answer would not be an option.

===Questioning autonomy===
[[Schopenhauer's criticism of Kantian philosophy#Categorical Imperative|Schopenhauer's criticism of the Kantian philosophy]] expresses doubt concerning the absence of [[egoism]] in the Categorical Imperative. [[Schopenhauer]] claimed that the Categorical Imperative is actually [[hypothetical]] and egotistical, not categorical.

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] believed Kantian autonomy was insufficient and that, if unchecked, people tend to be lenient in their own case, either by not exercising the full rigor of the moral law or by not properly disciplining themselves of moral transgressions:

{{quote |text=Kant was of the opinion that man is his own law (autonomy) - that is, he binds himself under the law which he himself gives himself. Actually, in a profounder sense, this is how lawlessness or experimentation are established. This is not being rigorously earnest any more than [[Sancho Panza]]'s self-administered blows to his own bottom were vigorous. ... Now if a man is never even once willing in his lifetime to act so decisively that [a lawgiver] can get hold of him, well, then it happens, then the man is allowed to live on in self-complacent illusion and make-believe and experimentation, but this also means: utterly without grace. |source=''Papers and Journals''&lt;ref name="Kierkegaard"&gt;{{cite book |last=Green |first=Ronald | title=Kierkegaard and Kant: The Hidden Debt |publisher=SUNY Press |year=1992 |page=90-91}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Application of the categorical imperative ==

=== The trial of Adolf Eichmann ===
In 1961, discussion of Kant's categorical imperative was even included in the trial of the infamous [[SS]] Lieutenant Colonel [[Adolf Eichmann]] in [[Jerusalem]].

As [[Hannah Arendt]] wrote in her book on the trial, Eichmann declared "with great emphasis that he had lived his whole life ... according to a Kantian definition of duty". Arendt considered this so "incomprehensible on the face of it" that it confirmed her sense that he wasn't really thinking at all, just mouthing accepted formulae, thereby establishing his banality.&lt;ref name="Arendt"&gt;{{cite book
 |last   = Arendt
 |first  = Hannah

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Judge Raveh indeed had asked Eichmann whether he thought he had really lived according to the categorical imperative during the war.  Eichmann acknowledged he did not "live entirely according to it, although I would like to do so." &lt;ref name="Arendt" /&gt;

[[Deborah Lipstadt]], in her book on the trial, takes this as evidence that evil is not ''banal'', but is in fact ''self-aware''{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. &lt;!--  "Eichmann had acknowledged that he understood the implications of what he was doing but continued to obey his orders [not his Kantian duty] nonetheless."{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} --&gt;

=== Application of the universalizability principle to the ethics of consumption ===

[[Pope Francis]], in [[Laudato si|his 2015 encyclical]], applies the first formulation of the universalizability principle to the issue of consumption:
::Instead of resolving the problems of the poor and thinking of how the world can be different, some can only propose a reduction in the birth rate. ... To blame population growth instead of extreme and selective consumerism on the part of some, is one way of refusing to face the issues. It is an attempt to legitimize the present model of distribution, where a minority believes that it has the right to consume in a way which can never be universalized, since the planet could not even contain the waste products of such consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Francis]], ''Encyclical Letter ''Laudato Si'' of the Holy Father Francis on Care for Our Common Home'', § 50, [http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html May 24, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Game theory ===
One form of the categorical imperative is [[superrationality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reviews |first=Paul J. |last=Campbell |journal=Mathematics Magazine |volume=57 |issue=1 |date=January 1984 |pages=51–55 |jstor=2690298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Volunteer's Dilemma |first=Andreas |last=Diekmann |journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution |volume=29 |issue=4 |date=December 1985 |pages=605–610 |doi=10.1177/0022002785029004003 |jstor=174243}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was elucidated by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] as a new approach to [[game theory]]. Unlike in conventional game theory, a superrational player will act as if all other players are superrational too and that a superrational agent will always come up with the same strategy as any other superrational agent when facing the same problem.

'''Categorical perception'''  is a phenomenon of [[perception]] of distinct categories when there is a gradual change in a variable along a continuum. It was originally observed for auditory stimuli but now found to be applicable to other perceptual modalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fugate Jennifer M. B. | date = Jan 2013 | title = Categorical Perception for Emotional Faces | url = | journal = Emotion Review | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 84–89 | doi=10.1177/1754073912451350| pmc = 4267261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, D.

==The motor theory of speech perception==
{{main|Motor theory of speech perception}}
And what about the very building blocks of the [[language]] we use to name categories: Are our speech-sounds —/ba/, /da/, /ga/ —innate or learned? The first question we must answer about them is whether they are categorical categories at all, or merely [[arbitrary]] points along a continuum. It turns out that if one analyzes the sound spectrogram of ba and pa, for example, both are found  to lie along an acoustic continuum called "voice-onset-time." With a technique similar to the one used in "morphing" visual images continuously into one another, it is possible to "morph" a /ba/ gradually into a /pa/ and beyond by gradually increasing the voicing [[parameter]].

[[Alvin Liberman]] and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Liberman, A. M., Harris, K. S., Hoffman, H. S. &amp; Griffith, B. C. |year=1957 |title=The discrimination of speech sounds within and across phoneme boundaries |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=54 |pages=358–368 |doi=10.1037/h0044417 |pmid=13481283 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; (he did not talk about voice onset time in that paper) reported that when people listen to sounds that vary along the voicing continuum, they hear only /ba/s and /pa/s, nothing in between. This effect—in which a perceived quality jumps abruptly from one category to another at a certain point along a continuum, instead of changing gradually—he dubbed "categorical perception" (CP). He suggested that CP was unique to speech, that CP made speech special, and, in what came to be called "the motor theory of speech [[perception]]," he suggested that CP's explanation lay in the anatomy of speech production.

According to the (now abandoned) [[motor theory of speech perception]], the reason people perceive an abrupt change between /ba/ and /pa/ is that the way we hear speech sounds is influenced by how people produce them when they speak. What is varying along this continuum is voice-onset-time: the "b" in /ba/ is voiced and the "p" in /pa/ is not. But unlike the synthetic "morphing" apparatus, people's natural vocal apparatus is not capable of producing anything in between ba and pa. So when one hears a [[sound]] from the voicing continuum, their brain perceives it by trying to match it with what it would have had to do to produce it. Since the only thing they can produce is /ba/ or /pa/, they will perceive any of the synthetic stimuli along the continuum as either /ba/ or /pa/, whichever it is closer to. A similar CP effect is found with ba/da; these too lie along a continuum acoustically, but vocally, /ba/ is formed with the two lips, /da/ with the tip of the tongue and the alveolar ridge, and our anatomy does not allow any intermediates.

The motor [[theory]] of speech perception explained how speech was special and why speech-sounds are perceived categorically: [[sensory perception]] is mediated by motor production. Wherever production is categorical, perception will be categorical; where production is continuous, perception will be continuous. And indeed vowel categories like a/u were found to be much less categorical than ba/pa or ba/da.

===Acquired distinctiveness===
If motor production mediates sensory [[perception]], then one assumes that this CP effect is a result of learning to produce [[Manner of articulation|speech]]. [[Peter D. Eimas|Eimas]] et al. (1971), however, found that [[infants]] already have speech CP before they begin to speak. Perhaps, then, it is an [[innate]] effect, evolved to "prepare" us to learn to speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eimas, P.D. |author2=Siqueland, E.R. |author3=Jusczyk, P.W. |author4=Vigorito, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1971 |title=Speech perception in infants |journal=Science |volume=171 |pages=303–306 |doi=10.1126/science.171.3968.303 |pmid=5538846 |issue=3968}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Kuhl (1987) found that chinchillas also have "speech CP" even though they never learn to speak, and presumably did not evolve to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Kuhl, P. K. |year=1987 |title=The Special-Mechanisms Debate in Speech Perception: Nonhuman Species and Nonspeech Signals |editor=S. Harnad |encyclopedia=Categorical perception: The groundwork of Cognition |location=New York |publisher=[[Cambridge University]] Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lane (1965) went on to show that CP effects can be induced by [[learning]] alone, with a purely sensory (visual) continuum in which there is no motor production discontinuity to mediate the perceptual discontinuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lane, H. |year=1965 |title=The motor theory of speech perception: A critical review |journal=Psychological Review |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=275–309 |doi=10.1037/h0021986 |pmid=14348425}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that speech CP is not special after all, but merely a special case of Lawrence's classic demonstration that stimuli to which you learn to make a different response become more distinctive and stimuli to which you learn to make the same response become more similar.

It also became clear that CP was not quite the all-or-none effect Liberman had originally thought it was: It is not that all /pa/s are indistinguishable and all /ba/s are indistinguishable: We can hear the differences, just as we can see the differences between different shades of red. It is just that the within-category differences (pa1/pa2 or red1/red2) sound/look much smaller than the between-category differences (pa2/ba1 or red2/yellow1), even when the size of the underlying physical differences (voicing, wavelength) are actually the same.

== Identification and discrimination tasks ==
The study of categorical perception often uses experiments involving discrimination and identification tasks in order to categorize participants' perceptions of sounds.  [[Voice-onset time|Voice onset time]] (VOT) is measured along a continuum rather than a binary.  English bilabial stops /b/ and /p/ are voiced and voiceless counterparts of the same place and manner of articulation, yet native speakers distinguish the sounds primarily by where they fall on the VOT continuum.  Participants in these experiments establish clear [[phoneme]] boundaries on the continuum; two sounds with different VOT will be perceived as the same phoneme if on the same side of the boundary.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Psycholinguistics|last=Fernández|first=Eva|last2=Cairns|first2=Helen|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-9147-0|location=West Sussex, United Kingdom|pages=175–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Participants take longer to discriminate between two sounds falling in the same category of VOT than between two on opposite sides of the phoneme boundary, even if the difference in VOT is greater between the two in the same category.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Repp|first=Bruno|date=1984|title=Categorical Perception: Issues, Methods, Findings|url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/Reprints/HL0443.pdf|journal=SPEECH AND LANGUAGE: Advances in Basic Research and Practice|volume=10|pages=243–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identification ===
In a categorical perception identification task, participants often must identify stimuli, such as speech sounds.  An experimenter testing the perception of the VOT boundary between  /p/ and /b/ may play several sounds falling on various parts of the VOT continuum and ask volunteers whether they hear each sound as /p/ or /b/.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandt|first=Jason|last2=Rosen|first2=Jeffrey|date=1980|title=Auditory Phonemic Perception in Dyslexia: Categorical Identification and Discrimination of Stop Consonants|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/0093934X80901522/1-s2.0-0093934X80901522-main.pdf?_tid=a344053c-2794-11e7-a156-00000aab0f27&amp;acdnat=1492890680_73e3ee524cc22d1289832b0032a43f19|journal=Brain and Language|volume=9|pages=324–337|doi=10.1016/0093-934x(80)90152-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such experiments, sounds on one side of the boundary are heard almost universally as /p/ and on the other as /b/.  Stimuli on or near the boundary take longer to identify and are reported differently by different volunteers, but are perceived as either /b/ or /p/, rather than as a sound somewhere in the middle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Discrimination ===
A simple AB discrimination task presents participants with two options and participants must decide if they are identical.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Predictions for a discrimination task in an experiment are often based on the preceding identification task.  An ideal discrimination experiment validating categorical perception of stop consonants would result in volunteers more often correctly discriminating stimuli that fall on opposite sides of the boundary, while discriminating at chance level on the same side of the boundary.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In an ABX discrimination task, volunteers are presented with three stimuli.  A and B must be distinct stimuli and volunteers decide which of the two the third stimulus X matches.  This discrimination task is much more common than a simple AB task.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==The Whorf hypothesis==
According to the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] (of which Lawrence's acquired similarity/distinctiveness effects would simply be a special case), language affects the way that people perceive the world. For example, colors are perceived categorically only because they happen to be named categorically: Our subdivisions of the [[spectrum]] are [[arbitrary]], learned, and vary across [[cultures]] and [[language]]s. But Berlin &amp; Kay (1969) suggested that this was not so: Not only do most cultures and languages subdivide and name the [[color spectrum]] the same way, but even for those who don't, the regions of compression and separation are the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Berlin, B.  |author2=Kay, P. |year=1969 |title=Basic color terms: Their universality and evolution. |publisher=Berkeley: [[University of California]] Press |isbn=1-57586-162-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; We all see blues as more alike and greens as more alike, with a fuzzy boundary in between, whether or not we have named the difference. This view has been challenged in a review article by Regier and Kay (2009) who discuss a distinction between the questions "1. Do color terms affect color perception?" and "2. Are color categories determined by largely arbitrary linguistic convention?". They report evidence that linguistic categories, stored in the left hemisphere of the brain for most people, do affect categorical perception but primarily in the right-eye visual field, and that this effect is eliminated with a concurrent verbal interference task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Regier, T.  |author2=Kay, P. |year=2009 |title=Language, thought, and color: Whorf was half right. |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=439–447 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2009.07.001 |pmid=19716754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universalism, in contrasts to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, posits that perceptual categories are innate, and are unaffected by the language that one speaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Linguistic relativity versus innate ideas: The origins of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis in German thought.|last=Penn|first=Julia, M.|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1972|isbn=|location=|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Support ===

Support of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis describes instances in which speakers of one language demonstrate categorical perception in a way that is different from speakers of another language. Examples of such evidence are provided below:

Regier and Kay (2009) reported evidence that linguistic categories affect categorical perception primarily in the right-eye visual field.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|title=Language, thought, and color: Whorf was half right.|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=13|issue=10|pages=439–447|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2009.07.001|pmid=19716754|author1=Regier, T.|author2=Kay, P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The right-eye visual field is controlled by the left hemisphere of the brain, which also controls language faculties. Davidoff (2001) presented evidence that in color discrimination tasks, native English speakers discriminated easier between color stimuli across a determined blue-green boundary than within the same side, but did not show CP when given the same task with Berinmo "nol" and "wor"; Berinmo speakers performed oppositely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davidoff|first=Jules|date=September 2001|title=Language and perceptual categorisation|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S1364661300017265/1-s2.0-S1364661300017265-main.pdf?_tid=c110f2bc-2863-11e7-b4a7-00000aacb35f&amp;acdnat=1492979636_b5ca81ccb343903518a491533a4e1091|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=5|pages=382–387|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(00)01726-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular theory in current research is "weak-Whorfianism,' which is the theory that although there is a strong universal component to perception, cultural differences still have an impact. For example, a 1998 study found that while there was evidence of universal perception of color between speakers of Setswana and English, there were also marked differences between the two language groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davies, I.R.L.; Sowden, P.T.; Jerrett, D.T.; Jerrett, T.; Corbett, G.G.|first=|date=1998|title=A cross-cultural study of English and Setswana speakers on a colour triads task: A test of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis|url=|journal=British Journal of Psychology|volume=89|pages=1–15|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1998.tb02669.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolved and learned CP ==

===Evolved CP===
First, back to [[vowels]]. The [[signature]] of CP is within-category compression and/or between-category separation. The size of the CP effect is merely a scaling factor; it is this compression/separation "accordion effect", that is CP's distinctive feature. In this respect, the "weaker" CP effect for vowels, whose motor production is continuous rather than categorical, but whose [[perception]] is by this criterion categorical, is every bit as much of a CP effect as the ba/pa and ba/da effects. But, as with colors, it looks as if the effect is an innate one: Our sensory category detectors for both color and speech sounds are born already "biased" by evolution: Our perceived color and speech-sound [[spectrum]] is already "warped" with these compression/separations.

===Learned CP===
The Lane/Lawrence demonstrations, lately replicated and extended by Goldstone (1994), showed that CP can be induced by learning alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goldstone, R. L. |year=1994 |title=Influences of categorization on perceptual discrimination |series=General |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=123 |issue=2 |pages=178–200 |pmid=8014612| doi= 10.1037/0096-3445.123.2.178 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also the countless [[Categorization|categories]] cataloged in our dictionaries that, according to categorical perception, are unlikely to be inborn. Nativist theorists such as Fodor [1983] have sometimes seemed to suggest that all of our [[Categorization|categories]] are inborn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fodor, J. |year=1983 |title=The modularity of mind |publisher=[[MIT]] Press |isbn=0-262-06084-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are recent demonstrations that, although the primary color and speech categories may be inborn, their boundaries can be modified or even lost as a result of learning, and weaker secondary boundaries can be generated by learning alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roberson, D., Davies, I. &amp; Davidoff, J. |year=2000 |title=Color categories are not universal: Replications and new evidence from a stone-age culture |series=General |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=369–398 |pmid=11006906 | doi = 10.1037/0096-3445.129.3.369 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of innate CP, our categorically biased [[Sensory receptor|sensory detectors]] pick out their prepared color and speech-sound categories far more readily and reliably than if our perception had been continuous.

Learning is a cognitive process that results in a relatively permanent change in behavior. Learning can influence perceptual processing.&lt;ref name=Notman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Notman|first=Leslie |author2=Paul Sowden |author3=Emre Ozgen|title=The Nature of Learned Categorical Perception Effects: A Psychophysical Approach|journal=Cognition|year=2005|volume=95|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2004.07.002|pages=B1–B14|pmid=15694641}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning influences perceptual processing by altering the way in which an individual perceives a given stimulus based on prior experience or knowledge. This means that the way something is perceived is changed by how it was seen, observed, or experienced before. The effects of learning can be studied in categorical perception by looking at the processes involved.&lt;ref name=Casey&gt;{{cite journal|last=Casey|first=Matthew|author2=Paul Sowden|title=Modeling learned categorical perception in human vision|journal=Neural Networks|year=2012|volume=33|doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2012.05.001|pages=114–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Learned categorical perception can be divided into different processes through some comparisons. The processes can be divided into between category and within category groups of comparison
.&lt;ref name=Foroni&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foroni|first=Francesco|author2=Myron Rothbart|title=Category Boundaries and Category Labels: When Does a Category Name Influence the Perceived Similarity of Category Members|journal=Social Cognition|year=2011|volume=29|issue=5|pages=547–576|doi=10.1521/soco.2011.29.5.547}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between category groups are those that compare between two separate sets of objects. Within category groups are those that compare within one set of objects. Between subjects comparisons lead to a categorical expansion effect. A categorical expansion occurs when the classifications and boundaries for the category become broader, encompassing a larger set of objects. In other words, a categorical expansion is when the "edge lines" for defining a category become wider. Within subjects comparisons lead to a categorical compression effect. A categorical compression effect corresponds to the narrowing of category boundaries to include a smaller set of objects (the "edge lines" are closer together).&lt;ref name=Foroni /&gt; Therefore, between category groups lead to less rigid group definitions whereas within category groups lead to more rigid definitions.

Another method of comparison is to look at both supervised and unsupervised group comparisons. Supervised groups are those for which categories have been provided, meaning that the category has been defined previously or given a label; unsupervised groups are groups for which categories are created, meaning that the categories will be defined as needed and are not labeled.&lt;ref name=Clapper&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clapper|first=John|title=The Effects of Prior Knowledge on Incidental Category Learning|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=2012|doi=10.1037/a0028457|volume=38|pages=1558–1577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying learned categorical perception, themes are important. Learning categories is influenced by the presence of themes. Themes increase quality of learning. This is seen especially in cases where the existing themes are opposite.&lt;ref name=Clapper /&gt;  In learned categorical perception, themes serve as cues for different categories. They assist in designating what to look for when placing objects into their categories. For example, when perceiving shapes, angles are a theme. The number of angles and their size provide more information about the shape and cue different categories. Three angles would cue a triangle, whereas four might cue a rectangle or a square. Opposite to the theme of angles would be the theme of circularity. The stark contrast between the sharp contour of an angle and the round curvature of a circle make it easier to learn.

Similar to themes, labels are also important to learned categorical perception.&lt;ref name=Foroni /&gt;  Labels are “noun-like” titles that can encourage categorical processing with a focus on similarities.&lt;ref name=Foroni /&gt; The strength of a label can be determined by three factors: analysis of affective (or emotional) strength, permeability (the ability to break through) of boundaries, and a judgment (measurement of rigidity) of discreteness.&lt;ref name=Foroni /&gt;   Sources of labels differ, and, similar to unsupervised/supervised categories, are either created or already exist.&lt;ref name=Foroni /&gt;&lt;ref name=Clapper /&gt; Labels affect perception regardless of their source. Peers, individuals, experts, cultures, and communities can create labels. The source doesn’t appear to matter as much as mere presence of a label, what matters is that there is a label. There is a positive correlation between strength of the label (combination of three factors) and the degree to which the label affects perception, meaning that the stronger the label, the more the label affects perception.&lt;ref name=Foroni /&gt;

Cues used in learned categorical perception can foster easier recall and access of prior knowledge in the process of learning and using categories.&lt;ref name=Clapper /&gt;  An item in a category can be easier to recall if the category has a cue for the memory.  As discussed, labels and themes both function as cues for categories, and, therefore, aid in the memory of these categories and the features of the objects belonging to them.

There are several brain structures at work that promote learned categorical perception. The areas and structures involved include: neurons, the prefrontal cortex, and the inferotemporal cortex.&lt;ref name=Casey /&gt;&lt;ref name=Prather&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prather|first=Jonathan|author2=Stephen Nowicki|author3=Rindy Anderson|author4=Susan Peters|author5=Richard Mooney|title=Neural Correlates of Categorical Perception in Learned Vocal Communication|journal=Nature Neuroscience|year=2009|volume=12|issue=2|doi=10.1038/nn.2246|pages=221–228|pmid=19136972|pmc=2822723}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurons in general are linked to all processes in the brain and, therefore, facilitate learned categorical perception. They send the messages between brain areas and facilitate the visual and linguistic processing of the category. The prefrontal cortex is involved in “forming strong categorical representations.”&lt;ref name=Casey /&gt; The inferotemporal cortex has cells that code for different object categories and are turned along diagnostic category dimensions, areas distinguishing category boundaries.&lt;ref name=Casey /&gt;

The learning of categories and categorical perception can be improved through adding verbal labels, making themes relevant to the self, making more separate categories, and by targeting similar features that make it easier to form and define categories.

Learned categorical perception occurs not only in human species but has been demonstrated in animal species as well. Studies have targeted categorical perception using humans, monkeys, rodents, birds, frogs.&lt;ref name=Prather /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2006.08.005 |author1=Eriksson, Jan L.  |author2=Villa, Alessandro E.P. |year=2006 |title=Learning of auditory equivalence classes for vowels by rats |journal=Behavioural Processes |volume=73 |pages=348–359 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376635706001872 | issue=3 |pmid=16997507}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies have led to numerous discoveries. They focus primarily on learning the boundaries of categories, where inclusion begins and ends, and they support the hypothesis that categorical perception does have a learned component.

==Computational and neural models==

Computational modeling (Tijsseling &amp; Harnad 1997; Damper &amp; Harnad 2000) has shown that many types of category-learning mechanisms (e.g. both back-propagation and competitive networks) display CP-like effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3758/BF03206927 |author1=Damper, R.I.  |author2=Harnad, S. |year=2000 |title=Neural Network Modeling of Categorical Perception |journal=Perception and Psychophysics |volume=62 |pages=843–867 |url=http://cogprints.org/1620/ | issue=4 |pmid=10883589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author1=Tijsseling, A.  |author2=Harnad, S. |year=1997 |title=Warping Similarity Space in Category Learning by Backprop Nets |editor=Ramscar, M. |editor2=Hahn, U. |editor3=Cambouropoulos, E. |editor4=Pain, H. |encyclopedia=Proceedings of SimCat 1997: Interdisciplinary Workshop on Similarity and Categorization |publisher=Department of Artificial Intelligence, Edinburgh University |pages=263–269 |url=http://cogprints.org/1608/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In back-propagation nets, the hidden-unit activation patterns that "represent" an input build up within-category compression and between-category separation as they learn; other kinds of nets display similar effects. CP seems to be a means to an end: Inputs that differ among themselves are "compressed" onto similar internal representations if they must all generate the same output; and they become more separate if they must generate different outputs. The network's "bias" is what filters inputs onto their correct output category. The nets accomplish this by selectively detecting (after much trial and error, guided by error-correcting feedback) the invariant features that are shared by the members of the same category and that reliably distinguish them from members of different categories; the nets learn to ignore all other variation as irrelevant to the [[categorization]].

==Brain basis==
Neural data provide correlates of CP and of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sharma, A.  |author2=Dorman, M.F. |year=1999 |title=Cortical auditory evoked potential correlates of categorical perception of voice-onset time |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |pmid=10462812 |volume=106 |pages=1078–1083 |doi=10.1121/1.428048 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences between event-related potentials recorded from the brain have been found to be correlated with differences in the perceived category of the stimulus viewed by the subject. [[Neural imaging]] studies have shown that these effects are localized and even lateralized to certain brain regions in subjects who have successfully learned the category, and are absent in subjects who have not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Seger, Carol A. |author2=Poldrack, Russell A. |author3=Prabhakaran, Vivek |author4=Zhao, Margaret |author5=Glover, Gary H. |author6=Gabrieli, John D.

Categorical perception is identified with the left prefrontal cortex with this showing such perception for speech units while this is not by posterior areas earlier in their processing such as areas in the left [[superior temporal gyrus]].&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02380.x | last1 = Myers | first1 = EB | last2 = Blumstein | first2 = SE | last3 = Walsh | first3 = E | last4 = Eliassen | first4 = J. | last5 = Batton | year = 2009 | first5 = D | last6 = Kirk | first6 = JS | title = Inferior frontal regions underlie the perception of phonetic category invariance | url = | journal = Psychol Sci | volume = 20 | issue = 7| pages = 895–903 | pmid = 19515116 | pmc = 2851201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language-induced==

Both innate and learned CP are sensorimotor effects: The compression/separation [[biases]] are sensorimotor biases, and presumably had sensorimotor origins, whether during the sensorimotor life-history of the [[organism]], in the case of learned CP, or the sensorimotor life-history of the species, in the case of innate CP. The [[neural net]] I/O models are also compatible with this fact: Their I/O biases derive from their I/O history. But when we look at our repertoire of [[Categorization|categories]] in a dictionary, it is highly unlikely that many of them had a direct sensorimotor history during our lifetimes, and even less likely in our ancestors' lifetimes. How many of us have seen a unicorn in real life? We have seen pictures of them, but what had those who first drew those pictures seen? And what about categories I cannot draw or see (or taste or touch): What about the most abstract categories, such as goodness and truth?

Some of our [[Categorization|categories]] must originate from another source than direct sensorimotor [[experience]], and here we return to language and the Whorf Hypothesis: Can categories, and their accompanying CP, be acquired through language alone? Again, there are some neural net simulation results suggesting that once a set of category names has been "grounded" through direct sensorimotor experience, they can be combined into Boolean combinations (man = male &amp; human) and into still higher-order [[combinations]] (bachelor = unmarried &amp; man) which not only pick out the more abstract, higher-order categories much the way the direct sensorimotor detectors do, but also inherit their CP effects, as well as generating some of their own. Bachelor inherits the compression/separation of unmarried and man, and adds a layer of separation/compression of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1075/eoc.4.1.07can |author1=Cangelosi, A.  |author2=Harnad, S. |year=2001 |title=The Adaptive Advantage of Symbolic Theft Over Sensorimotor Toil: Grounding Language in Perceptual Categories. |journal=Evolution of Communication |volume=4 |pages=117–142 |url=http://cogprints.org/2036/ | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cangelosi A. |author2=Greco A. |author3=Harnad S. |year=2000 |title=From robotic toil to symbolic theft: Grounding transfer from entry-level to higher-level categories |journal=Connection Science |volume=12 |pages=143–162 |url=http://cogprints.org/1647/ |doi=10.1080/09540090050129763 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These language-induced CP-effects remain to be directly demonstrated in human subjects; so far only learned and innate sensorimotor CP have been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author1=Pevtzow, R.  |author2=Harnad, S. |year=1997 |title=Warping Similarity Space in Category Learning by Human Subjects: The Role of Task Difficulty |editor=Ramscar, M. |editor2=Hahn, U. |editor3=Cambouropolos, E. |editor4=Pain, H. |encyclopedia=Proceedings of SimCat 1997: Interdisciplinary Workshop on Similarity and Categorization |publisher=Department of Artificial Intelligence, Edinburgh University |pages=189–195 |url=http://cogprints.org/1607/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Livingston, K.

That is enough to rehabilitate the Whorf Hypothesis from its apparent failure on color terms (and perhaps also from its apparent failure on eskimo snow terms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pullum, G.

==Emotion==
Emotions are an important characteristic of the human species. An emotion is an abstract concept that is most easily observed by looking at facial expressions. Emotions and their relation to categorical perception are often studied using facial expressions.&lt;ref name=Hess&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hess|first=Ursula |author2=Reginald Adams |author3=Robert Kleck|title=The Categorical Perception of Emotions and Traits|journal=Social Cognition|year=2009|volume=27|issue=2|doi=10.1521/soco.2009.27.2.320|pages=320–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cheal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheal|first=Jenna|author2=M.

Emotions are divided into categories because they are discrete from one another. Each emotion entails a separate and distinct set of reactions, consequences, and expressions. The feeling and expression of emotions is a natural occurrence, and, it is actually a universal occurrence for some emotions. There are six basic emotions that are considered universal to the human species across age, gender, race, country, and culture and that are considered to be categorically distinct. These six basic emotions are: happiness, disgust, sadness, surprise, anger, and fear.&lt;ref name=Sauter /&gt; According to the discrete emotions approach, people experience one emotion and not others, rather than a blend.&lt;ref name=Sauter /&gt; Categorical perception of emotional facial expressions does not require lexical categories.&lt;ref name=Sauter /&gt;  Of these six emotions, happiness is the most easily identified.

The perception of emotions using facial expressions reveals slight gender differences&lt;ref name=Hess /&gt; based on the definition and boundaries (essentially, the “edge line” where one emotion ends and a subsequent emotion begins) of the categories. The emotion of anger is perceived easier and quicker when it is displayed by males. However, the same effects are seen in the emotion of happiness when portrayed by women.&lt;ref name=Hess /&gt;  These effects are essentially observed because the categories of the two emotions (anger and happiness) are more closely associated with other features of these specific genders.

Although a verbal label is provided to emotions, it is not required to categorically perceive them. Before language in infants, they can distinguish emotional responses. The categorical perception of emotions is by a "hardwired mechanism".&lt;ref name= Sauter /&gt; Additional evidence exists showing the verbal labels from cultures that may not have a label for a specific emotion but can still categorically perceive it as its own emotion, discrete and isolated from other emotions.&lt;ref name= Sauter /&gt; The perception of emotions into categories has also been studied using the tracking of eye movements which showed an implicit response with no verbal requirement because the eye movement response required only the movement and no subsequent verbal response.&lt;ref name=Cheal /&gt;

The categorical perception of emotions is sometimes a result of joint processing. Other factors may be involved in this perception. Emotional expression and invariable features (features that remain relatively consistent) often work together.&lt;ref name= Otten /&gt; Race is one of the invariable features that contribute to categorical perception in conjunction with expression. Race can also be considered a social category.&lt;ref name=Otten /&gt; Emotional categorical perception can also be seen as a mix of categorical and dimensional perception. Dimensional perception involves visual imagery. Categorical perception occurs even when processing is dimensional.&lt;ref name= Fujimura /&gt;

Causeless cause is synonymous with '[[Absolute (philosophy)|the absolute]],' which '[[Logos|Proto-logos]]' is often confused with, but it is not: 'first' denotes finite bound, but causeless cause is unbounded.

In each cycle, causeless cause causes the Logoic [[Monad (Greek philosophy)|Monad]] to move into action, which develops into the Logoic triad/[[triple manifestation]], and the heptad (i.e. seven; [[prajapatis]] (Devas) or [[Elohim]]) which continue the cosmic chain of cause and effect. It has been shown the causeless cause is so described in some religious cosmogenesis accounts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

A '''courtesy title''' is a form of address in systems of [[nobility]] used for children, former wives and other close relatives of a [[peerage (disambiguation)|peer]], as well as  certain officials such as some judges and members of the Scottish [[Landed gentry|gentry]]. These [[style (manner of address)|styles]] are used 'by courtesy' in the sense that the relatives, officials and others  do not themselves hold [[substantive title]]s.  There are several different kinds of courtesy titles in the [[British peerage]].

==Children of peers==

=== Courtesy titles===
[[File:George Percy, Early Percy.jpg|thumb|The son of the current [[Ralph Percy, 12th Duke of Northumberland|Duke of Northumberland]] is addressed by the courtesy title of [[George Percy, Earl Percy|Earl Percy]]]]
If a peer of one of the top three ranks (a [[duke]], [[marquess]] or [[earl]]) has more than one title, his eldest son - himself not a peer - may use one of his father's lesser titles "by courtesy".  However, the father continues to be the substantive holder of the peerage title and the son using the title by courtesy legally subordinate unless issued a [[writ of acceleration]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} If the eldest son of a duke or marquess has an eldest son, he may use a still lower title, if one exists.

For example, the [[Duke of Norfolk]] is also [[Earl of Arundel]] and [[Baron Maltravers]].  His eldest son is therefore styled "Earl of Arundel" (without the definite article "The" which indicates a substantive title). Lord Arundel's eldest son (should he have one during his father's lifetime) would be styled "Lord Maltravers".  However, only The Duke of Norfolk is actually a peer; his son Lord Arundel and his hypothetical grandson Lord Maltravers are not.

Courtesy titles are only used by the peer's eldest living son, and the eldest son's eldest living son, and so forth. Other descendants are not permitted to use the peer's [[subsidiary title]]s. Only the [[heir apparent]] (and heir apparent to the heir apparent, and so on) may use them. An [[heir presumptive]] (e.g., a brother, nephew, or cousin) does not use a courtesy title. However, Scottish practice allows the style ''[[Master (Peerage of Scotland)|Master/Mistress]] of X'' to an heir presumptive as well as to an heir apparent; for example, the brother of the present [[Marquess of Tweeddale]] has the title ''Master of Tweeddale''.

Wives are entitled to use the feminine form of their husbands' courtesy titles. Thus, the wife of an Earl of Arundel would be styled "Countess of Arundel" (again, without the article).

Holders of courtesy titles do not, at the [[Court of St James's]], have their title preceded by the definite article "The" (which is always written with the capital letter "T"): e.g., 'Earl of Arundel' rather than 'The Earl of Arundel'.

===Choosing a courtesy peer's title===
The actual courtesy title which is used is a matter of family tradition. For instance, the eldest son of [[Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry|The Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry]] is styled "[[Earl of Dalkeith]]", even though the duke is also the [[Marquess of Dumfriesshire]], a title which outranks the earldom.  Similarly, the eldest son of [[Marquess of Londonderry|The Marquess of Londonderry]] is styled "[[Viscount Castlereagh]]", even though the marquess is also the [[Earl Vane]].

Titles with the same name as a peer's main title are also not used as courtesy titles. For instance, [[Duke of Westminster|The Duke of Westminster]] is also [[Marquess of Westminster|The Marquess of Westminster]] and [[Earl Grosvenor|The Earl Grosvenor]] (amongst other titles). The duke's eldest son is not styled "Marquess of Westminster" (which would cause confusion between the son and the father), and so is styled "Earl Grosvenor" instead. The title used does not have to be exactly equivalent to the actual peerage: the eldest son of the current [[Duke of Wellington (title)|Duke of Wellington]] is styled [[Marquess of Douro|Marquess ''of'' Douro]], although the actual peerage possessed by his father is Marquess Douro (not ''of'' Douro).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

If a peer of the rank of earl or above does not have any subsidiary titles of a name different from his main title, his eldest son usually uses an invented courtesy title of "Lord [Surname]". For instance, the eldest son of [[Earl of Devon|The Earl of Devon]] is styled "[[Lord Courtenay]]", even though the Earl has no [[baron|barony]] of that name, and similarly the eldest son of [[Earl of Guilford|The Earl of Guilford]] is styled "[[Lord North]]". The eldest son of [[Earl of Huntingdon|The Earl of Huntingdon]], who has no subsidiary titles, is styled "[[Viscount Hastings]]" to avoid confusion with the substantive peer [[Lord Hastings|The Lord Hastings]]. [[Earl Castle Stewart|The Earl Castle Stewart]]'s heir uses the style ''Viscount Stewart'' in order to avoid confusion with Lord Stewart, the eldest son of Viscount Castlereagh (the eldest son of [[Marquess of Londonderry|The Marquess of Londonderry]]).

=== Courtesy prefix of "Lord"===
Another form of courtesy title is the [[honorific]] prefix of "Lord" before the name. This non-peerage title is accorded to younger sons of dukes and marquesses. The courtesy title is added before the person's [[given name]] and [[surname]], as in the example of [[Lord Randolph Churchill]], although conversational usage drops the surname on secondary reference. The title persists after the death of the holder's father, but is not inherited by any of his children. The wife of the holder is entitled to the feminine form of her husband's title, which takes the form of "Lady", followed by her husband's [[given name]] and [[surname]], as in the example of [[Lady Randolph Churchill]]. The holder is addressed as "Lord Randolph" and his wife as "Lady Randolph".

=== Courtesy prefix of "Lady"===
The [[honorific]] prefix of "Lady" is used for the daughters of dukes, marquesses and earls. The courtesy title is added before the person's given name, as in the example [[Lady Diana Spencer]]. Because it is merely a courtesy with no legal implications, the honorific persists after the death of the holder's father but it is not inherited by her children.

The spouse of a woman with an honorific title does not hold any courtesy title in right of their spouse. Neither does the husband of a man with ''any'' title (including the husband of a peer).

=== Courtesy prefix of "The Honourable" ===
The younger sons of earls, along with all sons and daughters of viscounts, barons and lords of parliament are accorded the courtesy style of "[[The Honourable]]" before their name. This is usually abbreviated to "The Hon."  The title persists after the death of the holder's father, but it may not be inherited by the holder's children. It is used only in [[grammatical person|third person]] reference, not in speaking to the person.

===Married daughters===
The daughter of a duke, marquess, or earl who marries an untitled man becomes "Lady [''Given name''] [''Husband's surname'']".  The daughter of a viscount or baron who marries a commoner is styled "The Honourable [''Given name''] [''Husband's surname'']" (the given name is dropped and ''Mrs'' is substituted if the husband's right to the style derives from office or appointment rather than from ancestral peerage).

Any woman who marries a peer uses the feminine version of his peerage title, even if her own precedence is higher than his, as in the case of a duke's daughter marrying a baron, because a peerage is a substantive title, the usage of which is preferred to any courtesy style - unless she marries into the Royal Family. If a woman marries the younger son of a duke or marquess, she becomes "Lady [''Husband's given name''] [''Husband's surname'']." If she marries the younger son of an earl, viscount or baron, she becomes "The Hon. Mrs [''Husband's given name''] [''Husband's surname'']."

In case of a divorce, she may keep the same style as during marriage or she may choose to assume the style "Mrs [''Given name''] [''Husband's surname'']." Regardless of what she chooses, she loses all precedence acquired from marriage and because of the former option, there can be multiple ''Lady John Smiths''.

===Adoption===
Until 2004, children who had been adopted by peers had no right to any courtesy title. Pursuant to a Royal Warrant dated 30 April 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=57306 |page=6821 |date=2 June 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; these children are now automatically entitled to the same styles and courtesy titles as their siblings.  However, unlike biological children, they cannot inherit peerages from their parent&lt;ref&gt;See: Adoption Act 1976, section 44(1) and Adoption and Children Act 2002, chapter 4, section 71(1). "An adoption does not affect the descent of any peerage or dignity or title of honour."&lt;/ref&gt; (and thus, since they cannot be heirs, if a peer adopts a son and he is the oldest son, he would use the styles of younger sons). For example, actress [[Nimmy March]], the daughter of The Duke and Duchess of Richmond, was immediately elevated to Lady Naomi Gordon-Lennox on 30 April 2004.

Note that Scottish peerages' rules for courtesy titles and styles differ.

==Indirect inheritance==
Occasionally a peer succeeds to a peerage upon the death of a relative who is not one of his or her parents. When this happens, the relatives of the new peer may be allowed to use the courtesy titles or styles which would have been accorded them if the new peer had succeeded a parent or grandparent in the title.

For instance, [[Rupert Ponsonby, 7th Baron de Mauley]], succeeded his uncle in 2002. His brother Ashley had no title, as their father was only the younger son of a peer and was never actually Baron de Mauley. However, in 2003, Ashley was granted, by [[Warrant of Precedence]] from [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], the style and precedence that would have been his had his father survived to inherit the barony, becoming ''The Honourable Ashley Ponsonby''. Precedence in such circumstances is usually granted but is not automatic.

== Spouses of peers ==
The wife of a substantive peer is legally entitled to the privileges of peerage: she is said to have a "life estate" in her husband's dignity. Thus a duke's wife is titled a "[[duchess]]", a marquess's wife a "[[marchioness]]", an earl's wife a "[[countess]]", a viscount's wife a "[[viscountess]]" and a baron's wife a "[[baron]]ess". Despite being referred to as a "peeress", she is not a peer in her own right: this is a 'style' and not a substantive title. However, this is considered a legal title, unlike the social titles of a peer's children.

The wives of eldest sons of peers hold their titles on the same basis as their husbands, i.e. by courtesy. Thus the wife of the Marquess of Douro is known as the "Marchioness of Douro".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bloomsbury Publishing|title=Scottish Clans and Territorial Houses|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=10jOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=courtesy+title+the+younger++bloomsbury&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Yzj_a06MQb&amp;sig=FYFTl7XYZZvaOrqMgpf6m8kf8ik&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi79dLZ_5_OAhUBxpQKHZ_3DlMQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=courtesy%20title%20the%20younger%20%20bloomsbury&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 August 2016|work=Titles and Forms of Address: A Guide to Correct Use|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing – April 2016|date=2016|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Husbands ===
In the case of a woman who is a substantive peer in her own right, by succession or by first creation (i.e. ennoblement, most commonly in recent times under the [[Life Peerages Act 1958]]), her husband acquires no distinction in right of his wife. Thus, the husband of [[Virginia Bottomley|The Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone]] has no courtesy title; he was simply called "Mr [[Peter Bottomley]]" until he was knighted and became "Sir Peter Bottomley".

In 2013, there was a [[private member's bill]] in the [[House of Lords]] to allow the spouse of a woman who holds an honour, if he or she enters civil partnership or marriage, to assume the title ''The Honourable''. This bill stalled, and was not passed by the end of the Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/honoursequalityoftitlesforpartners.html Honours (Equality of Titles for Partners) Bill 2012-13]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2013-14/equalitytitles.html Equality (Titles) Bill [HL&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 2013-14]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Divorced wives ===
A peeress retains her legal right to the peerage style following divorce and even upon her remarriage to a non-peer.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1901/07/31/117970280.pdf | title=Divorced Peeresses Titles | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=31 July 1901 | accessdate=6 July 2013 | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; A convention has developed whereby her Christian name is added in front of her title to distinguish her from any subsequent wife of her former husband. Hence, "Her Grace The Duchess of London" becomes "Mary, Duchess of London".  In written forms, she is not entitled to the use of the address "Her Grace..." but may be addressed as "Duchess". "The Rt Hon. The Lady London" becomes "Mary, Lady London" and may be addressed as "Lady London",  or "My Lady".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bloomsbury Publishing|title=Scottish Clans and Territorial Houses|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=10jOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=courtesy+title+the+younger++bloomsbury&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Yzj_a06MQb&amp;sig=FYFTl7XYZZvaOrqMgpf6m8kf8ik&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi79dLZ_5_OAhUBxpQKHZ_3DlMQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=courtesy%20title%20the%20younger%20%20bloomsbury&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 August 2016|work=Titles and Forms of Address: A Guide to Correct Use|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing – April 2016|date=2016|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 August 1996 [[letters patent]] changed titles of divorced wives of [[British prince]]s, depriving their former wives of the style of [[Royal Highness]]. For this reason ''Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales'' after divorce became [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. The same happened to ''Her Royal Highness The Duchess of York'' who became  [[Sarah, Duchess of York]].

=== Widows ===
If a prince or peer dies, his wife's style does not change unless the new peer is a married man (or a woman, if the succession permits); traditionally the widowed peeress puts "[[Dowager]]" in her style, i.e. "The Most Hon. The Marchioness of London" becomes "The Most Hon. The Dowager Marchioness of London."

If a widowed peeress's son predeceases her, her daughter-in-law does not use the title of Dowager, but is styled, e.g. "The Most Hon. Mary, Marchioness of London", until her mother-in-law dies, at which point she may use the title of "Dowager Marchioness". In more recent times, some widows choose to be styled with their Christian names, instead of as Dowager,  e.g. "Olave, Lady Baden-Powell" ("Lady Olave Baden-Powell" would incorrectly imply she was the daughter of a duke, marquess or earl).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bloomsbury Publishing|title=Scottish Clans and Territorial Houses|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=10jOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=courtesy+title+the+younger++bloomsbury&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Yzj_a06MQb&amp;sig=FYFTl7XYZZvaOrqMgpf6m8kf8ik&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi79dLZ_5_OAhUBxpQKHZ_3DlMQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=courtesy%20title%20the%20younger%20%20bloomsbury&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 August 2016|work=Titles and Forms of Address: A Guide to Correct Use|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing – April 2016|date=2016|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Divorced wives and widows who remarry ===
It used to be customary for women with higher titles from one marriage to retain them even on subsequent remarriage.  As Lord Macnaughten put it in the case of ''Earl Cowley v Countess Cowley'' [1901] AC 450:  ''"...everybody knows that it is a very common practice for peeresses (not being peeresses in their own right) after marrying commoners to retain the title lost by such marriage. It is not a matter of right. It is merely a matter of courtesy, and allowed by the usages of society."'' The divorce court, in the above case, granted the earl an injunction preventing his former wife from using his title; however this was overturned by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], whose decision was confirmed by the [[House of Lords]], on the grounds that ordinary courts of law lacked any jurisdiction in matters of honour.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

The same practice was followed by widows who remarried.  A prominent example was [[Catherine Parr]], the last wife of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], who continued to be known as Queen Catherine even after her marriage to The Lord Seymour of Sudeley (and, indeed, she disputed precedence with the wife of her brother-in-law the Duke of Somerset on this basis). This usage died out later in the twentieth century, and women who remarry now ordinarily take a new married name and do not retain their former title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bloomsbury Publishing|title=Scottish Clans and Territorial Houses|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=10jOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=courtesy+title+the+younger++bloomsbury&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Yzj_a06MQb&amp;sig=FYFTl7XYZZvaOrqMgpf6m8kf8ik&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi79dLZ_5_OAhUBxpQKHZ_3DlMQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=courtesy%20title%20the%20younger%20%20bloomsbury&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 August 2016|work=Titles and Forms of Address: A Guide to Correct Use|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing – April 2016|date=2016|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil partners ===
If a peer or knight enters into a [[Civil partnerships in the United Kingdom|civil partnership]], his or her partner is not entitled to a courtesy title.&lt;ref name="cnnquote"&gt;{{cite web |quote=The Queen herself knighted Sir Elton John, so his new bride would normally be called a lady.

==Scottish courtesy titles==
[[Laird]] is a courtesy title  which applies to the owner of  certain long-established [[Scotland|Scottish]] estates; the title being attached to the estate. Traditionally, a laird is formally [[courtesy title|styled]] in the manner evident on the 1730 [[tombstone]] in a Scottish churchyard. It reads:  "[[The Much Honoured]] [''Forename'' (John)] [''Surname'' (Grant)] Laird of [''Lairdship'' (Glenmoriston)]". The section titled ''Scottish Feudal Baronies'' in [[Debrett's]]  states that the use of the prefix "The Much Hon." is "correct", but that "most lairds prefer the unadorned name and [[territorial designation]]".  The wife of a Laird is traditionally accorded the courtesy title of [[Lady]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Graeme|title=How to Trace Your Ancestry From Your Own Computer|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=nTGfBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT68&amp;lpg=PT68&amp;dq=laird+courtesy+title&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bCLnI3U2sn&amp;sig=BNvPWhqq4zIWhgBs4YB_5SDhgaE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD0rnV44TUAhXEnpQKHf5zDZMQ6AEIajAP#v=onepage&amp;q=laird%20courtesy%20title&amp;f=false|publisher=Hachette UK, 31 Jul. 2009|accessdate=23 May 2014|quote=The Scottish title "Laird" is a courtesy title with no legal status...in reality, certain long-established estates have the title attached to them...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Titles and Forms of Address|isbn=9781408148129 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=UZKrBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT88&amp;dq=laird+title+of+wife+of&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY-Oy7tsbKAhVhYqYKHfgTD6gQ6AEISDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=laird%20title%20of%20wife%20of&amp;f=false |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|date=31 January 2007|accessdate=26 January 2016|quote=The widow of a chief or laird continues to use the territorial style and the prefix Dowager may be used in the same circumstances ...

===Courtesy suffix of "Younger"===
A form of courtesy title granted is the suffix of "[[Younger (title)|The Younger]]"  (also  written   as '''Yr''' '''or yr''') at the end of the name. This title is granted to the [[Heir Apparent]] of a [[Laird]] (Lord) and is placed at the end of his or her name (example - Mr John Smith of Edinburgh, Younger). The wife of a Younger may herself place the title at the end of her name. The holder is addressed as the younger (example - The Younger of Edinburgh).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsbarons.org/male_heir.htm |title=The Convention of The Baronage of Scotland: Male Heir|publisher=scotsbarons.org|accessdate=16  September  2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bloomsbury Publishing|title=Scottish Clans and Territorial Houses|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=10jOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=courtesy+title+the+younger++bloomsbury&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Yzj_a06MQb&amp;sig=FYFTl7XYZZvaOrqMgpf6m8kf8ik&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi79dLZ_5_OAhUBxpQKHZ_3DlMQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=courtesy%20title%20the%20younger%20%20bloomsbury&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 August 2016|work=Titles and Forms of Address: A Guide to Correct Use|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing – April 2016|date=2016|quote=The heirs of chiefs, chieftains and lairds are addressed in writing  with the distinction "the younger"  before or after the territorial designation...all unmarried daughters use the (territorial) title...It is not the custom for younger sons of a chief, chieftain or laird to use either the "Younger" or the territorial titles  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish Feudal Baronies|url=http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/titles/scottish-and-irish-titles/scottish-feudal-baronies|website=debretts.com|accessdate=11 February 2016|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Courtesy prefix of "Maid"===
The courtesy prefix of "Maid" is granted to the eldest daughter of a Laird (Lord). If the eldest daughter is also the [[heir presumptive]] she may either hold the title "Younger" or the title "Maid". The title is customary and not automatically given. The title is placed at the end of the name (example - Miss Ali Joy, Maid of Newcastle). The holder is addressed as "The Maid of [[Laird]]ship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish Feudal Baronies|url=http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/titles/scottish-and-irish-titles/scottish-feudal-baronies|website=debretts.com|accessdate=11 February 2016|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precedence status of courtesy titles==
The courtesy titles and styles of children of peers are social, not legal. For this reason, in official documents, Lord John Smith is often referred to as ''John Smith, Esq., commonly called Lord John Smith''; The Hon. Mrs Smith would be called ''Mary Jane, Mrs Smith, commonly called The Hon. Mary Jane Smith''. Only peers in attendance at Parliament enjoy [[statute|statutory]] precedence. There is, however, official [[United Kingdom order of precedence|precedence]] accorded at the Court of St James's that results from being the wife or child of a peer, and to which social styles are attached. The wives of peers, however, are peeresses and legally enjoy their titles in exactly the same manner as peeresses in their own right.

Children of peers can outrank certain actual peers. For instance, the daughter of a duke outranks a countess. However, if the daughter of a duke marries an earl, she drops to the rank of countess, because her courtesy title is subsumed in his substantive title. But, if that same daughter marries a commoner, she retains her rank. If that daughter marries the eldest son of an earl, though he may be a courtesy peer, she may keep her rank until the son inherits the earldom, when she must drop to the rank of countess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bloomsbury Publishing|title=Scottish Clans and Territorial Houses|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=10jOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=courtesy+title+the+younger++bloomsbury&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Yzj_a06MQb&amp;sig=FYFTl7XYZZvaOrqMgpf6m8kf8ik&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi79dLZ_5_OAhUBxpQKHZ_3DlMQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=courtesy%20title%20the%20younger%20%20bloomsbury&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 August 2016|work=Titles and Forms of Address: A Guide to Correct Use|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing – April 2016|date=2016|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial courtesy titles==
Following the creation of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]], the first Justices of that Court held life peerages, and continued to hold them. However, the Government has announced that future appointees will not be created peers, and the first non-peer appointed to the Court was [[John Dyson, Lord Dyson|Sir John Dyson]]. In order to avoid any distinction between the Scottish Justices of the Court (who receive a judicial title), by Royal Warrant dated 10 December 2010 all Justices of the Supreme Court not holding a peerage are entitled to a judicial title, and retain the style (a courtesy title) for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=59746 |pages=6177–6178  |date=1 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, Sir John Dyson is now styled as ''Lord Dyson'' (instead of ''The Lord Dyson'').&lt;ref name="uksc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/pr_1013.pdf |title=Courtesy titles for Justices of the Supreme Court |date=13 December 2010 |publisher=[[The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wives of male justices not holding a peerage are styled as if they were wives of peers.

In Scotland, [[Senators of the College of Justice]] (judges who sit in the [[Court of Session]]) use the title Lord or Lady along with a surname or a territorial name. All Senators of the College have the honorific, The Honourable, before their titles, while those who are also Privy Counsellors or peers have the honorific, The Right Honourable. Senators are made Privy Counsellors upon promotion to the Inner House. For example, [[Alexander Wylie, Lord Kinclaven|Alexander Wylie]] is known as ''The Honourable Lord Kinclaven'', whilst [[Ronald Mackay, Lord Eassie|Ronald Mackay]] is known as ''The Right Honourable Lord Eassie''.  Some Senators also hold peerage titles, such as [[Lynda Clark, Baroness Clark of Calton|The Rt Hon. The Lady Clark of Calton]], and these would be used in place of judicial titles.

==Professional courtesy titles==
The title of "[[Doctor (title)|Doctor]]" (or the abbreviation "Dr") is used as a courtesy title in a number of fields by professionals who do not hold doctoral degrees. It is commonly used in this manner by qualified medical practitioners (except surgeons) and by qualified dentists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095724299|title=Doctor|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|work=Oxford Reference|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons]] also allows the use of "Doctor" as a courtesy title by its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.rcvs.org.uk/news-and-events/news/uk-veterinary-surgeons-to-use-courtesy-doctor-title/ |title=UK veterinary surgeons to use courtesy ‘Doctor’ title |publisher=[[Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons]] |date=6 March 2015 |accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of ''[[Captain]]'' is used as a courtesy title by shipmasters in the merchant navy who do not hold the military rank of captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifsma.org/tempannounce/captain.html|title=The Courtesy Title of "Captain"|publisher=International Federation of Shipmasters' Associations|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used in oral address for naval officers below the rank of captain who are in command of a ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/captain-military-and-maritime-service-rank#ref755719|work=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|accessdate=27 June 2017|title= Captain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12493">In [[error detection]], the '''Damm algorithm''' is a [[check digit]] [[algorithm]] that detects all [[Transcription error|single-digit errors]] and all [[Transcription error#Transposition error|adjacent transposition errors]]. It was presented by H. Michael Damm in 2004.&lt;ref name="fenwick2014" /&gt;

== Strengths and weaknesses ==
The Damm algorithm is similar to the [[Verhoeff algorithm]]. It too will detect ''all'' occurrences of the two most frequently appearing types of [[transcription error]]s, namely altering one single digit, and transposing two adjacent digits (including the transposition of the trailing check digit and the preceding digit).&lt;ref name="fenwick2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salomon2005" /&gt; But the Damm algorithm has the benefit that it makes do without the dedicatedly constructed [[permutation]]s and its position specific [[Exponentiation#In abstract algebra|powers]] being inherent in the [[Verhoeff algorithm|Verhoeff scheme]]. Furthermore, a table of [[Inverse element|inverses]] can be dispensed with provided all main diagonal entries of the operation table are zero.

The Damm algorithm does not suffer from exceeding the number of 10 possible values, resulting in the need for using a non-digit character (as the [[X]] in the [[ISBN#ISBN-10 check digit calculation|10-digit ISBN]] [[Check digit#ISBN 10|check digit]] scheme).

Prepending leading zeros does not affect the check digit.&lt;ref name="fenwick2014" /&gt;

There are totally anti-symmetric quasigroups that detect all phonetic errors associated with the English language (13 ↔ 30, 14 ↔ 40, ..., 19 ↔ 90). The table used in the illustrating example is based on an instance of such kind.

Despite its desirable properties in typical contexts where similar algorithms are used, the Damm algorithm is largely unknown and scarcely used in practice.

== Design ==

Its essential part is a [[quasigroup]] of [[Order (group theory)|order]] 10 (i.e. having a {{nowrap|10 × 10}} [[Latin square]] as the body of its [[Cayley table|operation table]]) with the special feature of being [[Quasigroup#Total antisymmetry|weakly totally anti-symmetric]].&lt;ref name="dhmd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="damm2007" /&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-roman" name="BIS2003" /&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-roman" name="Chen2009" /&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-roman" name="Mileva2009" /&gt; Damm revealed several methods to create totally anti-symmetric quasigroups of order 10 and gave some examples in his doctoral dissertation.&lt;ref name="dhmd" /&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-roman" name="BIS2003" /&gt; With this, Damm also disproved an old conjecture that totally anti-symmetric quasigroups of order 10 do not exist.&lt;ref name="damm2003" /&gt;

A quasigroup {{math|(''Q'', ∗)}} is called totally anti-symmetric if for all {{math|''c'', ''x'', ''y'' ∈ ''Q''}}, the following implications hold:&lt;ref name="damm2007" /&gt;
# {{math|1=(''c'' ∗ ''x'') ∗ ''y'' = (''c'' ∗ ''y'') ∗ ''x'' ⇒ ''x'' = ''y''}}
# {{math|1=''x'' ∗ ''y'' = ''y'' ∗ ''x'' ⇒ ''x'' = ''y''}},

and it is called weak totally anti-symmetric if only the first implication holds. Damm proved that the existence of a totally anti-symmetric quasigroup of order {{math|''n''}} is equivalent to the existence of a weak totally anti-symmetric quasigroup of order {{math|''n''}}. For the Damm algorithm with the check equation
{{math|1=(…((0 ∗ ''x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'') ∗ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''−1&lt;/sub&gt;) ∗ …) ∗ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}
a weak totally anti-symmetric quasigroup with the property 
{{math|1=''x'' ∗ ''x'' = 0}}
is needed. Such a quasigroup can be constructed from any totally anti-symmetric quasigroup by rearranging the columns in such a way that all zeros lay on the diagonal. And, on the other hand, from any weak totally anti-symmetric quasigroup a totally anti-symmetric quasigroup can be constructed by rearranging the columns in such a way that the first row is in natural order.&lt;ref name="dhmd" /&gt;

== Algorithm ==
The validity of a digit sequence containing a check digit is defined over a quasigroup. A quasigroup table ready for use can be taken from Damm's dissertation (pages 98, 106, 111).&lt;ref name="dhmd" /&gt; It is useful if each main diagonal entry is 0,&lt;ref name=fenwick2014 /&gt; because it simplifies the check digit calculation.

=== Validating a number against the included check digit ===
#Set up an interim digit and initialize it to 0.
#Process the number digit by digit: Use the number's digit as column index and the interim digit as row index, take the table entry and replace the interim digit with it.
#The number is valid if and only if the resulting interim digit has the value of 0.&lt;ref name=fenwick2014 /&gt;

=== Calculating the check digit ===
'''Prerequisite:''' The main diagonal entries of the table are 0.
#Set up an interim digit and initialize it to 0.
#Process the number digit by digit: Use the number's digit as column index and the interim digit as row index, take the table entry and replace the interim digit with it.
#The resulting interim digit gives the check digit and will be appended as trailing digit to the number.&lt;ref name=fenwick2014 /&gt;

== Example ==
The following operation table will be used.&lt;ref name="fenwick2014" /&gt; It may be obtained from the totally anti-symmetric quasigroup in Damm's doctoral dissertation page 111&lt;ref name="dhmd" /&gt; by rearranging the rows and changing the entries correspondingly.

|- style="color:#00A000"
! style="color:black" | &lt;span style="color:#00A000"&gt;digit to be processed&lt;/span&gt; → column index
| style="width:1.5em" | 5
| style="width:1.5em" | 7
| style="width:1.5em" | 2
|-
! style="color:black" | old &lt;span style="color:#E000E0"&gt;interim digit&lt;/span&gt; → row index
|'''0'''
|9
|7
|-
! style="color:black" | table entry → new &lt;span style="color:#E000E0"&gt;interim digit&lt;/span&gt;
|9
|7
|'''4'''
|}
The resulting interim digit is '''4'''. This is the calculated check digit. We append it to the number and obtain '''5724'''.

=== Validating a number against the included check digit ===
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;background:none;color:#E000E0"
|- style="color:#00A000"
! style="color:black" | &lt;span style="color:#00A000"&gt;digit to be processed&lt;/span&gt; → column index
| style="width:1.5em" | 5
| style="width:1.5em" | 7
| style="width:1.5em" | 2
| style="width:1.5em" | 4
|-
! style="color:black" | old &lt;span style="color:#E000E0"&gt;interim digit&lt;/span&gt; → row index
|'''0'''
|9
|7
|4
|-
! style="color:black" | table entry → new &lt;span style="color:#E000E0"&gt;interim digit&lt;/span&gt;
|9
|7
|4
|'''0'''
|}
The resulting interim digit is '''0''', hence the number is '''valid'''.

=== Graphical illustration ===

This is the above example showing the detail of the algorithm generating the check digit (broken blue arrow) and verifying the number '''572''' with the check digit.

'''Defensive programming''' is a form of [[defensive design]] intended to ensure the continuing function of a piece of [[software]] under unforeseen circumstances. Defensive programming practices are often used where high availability, safety or security is needed.

Defensive programming is an approach to improve software and source code, in terms of:
* General quality – reducing the number of [[software bug]]s and problems.
* Making the source code comprehensible – the source code should be readable and understandable so it is approved in a [[code audit]].
* Making the software behave in a predictable manner despite unexpected inputs or user actions.

Overly defensive programming, however, may safeguard against errors that will never be encountered, thus wasting runtime and maintenance costs. There is also the risk that the code traps or prevents too many exceptions, potentially resulting in unnoticed, incorrect results.

== Secure programming ==
{{main|Secure coding}}

Secure programming is the subset of defensive programming concerned with [[computer security]]. That is to say, security is the concern, not necessarily safety or availability (the software may be allowed to fail in certain ways). As with all kinds of defensive programming, avoiding bugs is a primary objective, however the motivation is not as much to reduce the likelihood of failure in normal operation (as if safety was the concern), but to reduce the attack surface – the programmer must assume that the software might be misused actively to reveal bugs, and that bugs could be exploited maliciously.

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;int risky_programming(char *input){
  char str[1000+1];  // One more for the null character.
  
  // ...
  
  strcpy(str, input);  // Copy input.
  
  // ...
}&lt;/source&gt;
The function will result in undefined behavior when the input is over 1000 characters. Some novice programmers may not feel that this is a problem, supposing that no user will enter such a long input. This particular bug demonstrates a vulnerability which enables [[buffer overflow]] [[exploit (computer security)|exploit]]s. Here is a solution to this example:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;int secure_programming(char *input){
  char str[1000+1];  // One more for the null character.

  // ...

  // Copy input without exceeding the length of the destination.
  strncpy(str, input, sizeof(str)); 

  // If strlen(input) &gt;= sizeof(str) then strncpy won't null terminate. 
  // We counter this by always setting the last character in the buffer to NUL,
  // effectively cropping the string to the maximum length we can handle.
  // One can also decide to explicitly abort the program if strlen(input) is 
  // too long.
  str[sizeof(str) - 1] = '\0';

  // ...
}&lt;/source&gt;

== Offensive programming ==
{{main|Offensive programming}}

Offensive programming is a category of defensive programming, with the added emphasis that certain errors should ''not'' be [[graceful degradation|handled defensively]]. In this practice, only errors from outside the program's control are to be handled (such as user input); the software itself, as well as data from within the program's line of defense, are to be trusted in this methodology.

=== Trusting internal data validity ===

;Overly defensive programming
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
const char* trafficlight_colorname(enum trafficlight_color c) {
    switch (c) {
        case TRAFFICLIGHT_RED:    return "red";
        case TRAFFICLIGHT_YELLOW: return "yellow";
        case TRAFFICLIGHT_GREEN:  return "green";
    }
    return "black"; // To be handled as a dead traffic light.
}
&lt;/source&gt;

;Offensive programming
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
const char* trafficlight_colorname(enum trafficlight_color c) {
    switch (c) {
        case TRAFFICLIGHT_RED:    return "red";
        case TRAFFICLIGHT_YELLOW: return "yellow";
        case TRAFFICLIGHT_GREEN:  return "green";
    }
    assert(0); // Assert that this section is unreachable.
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Trusting software components ===

;Overly defensive programming
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
if (is_legacy_compatible(user_config)) {
    // Strategy: Don't trust that the new code behaves the same
    old_code(user_config);
} else {
    // Fallback: Don't trust that the new code handles the same cases
    if (new_code(user_config) != OK) {
        old_code(user_config);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

;Offensive programming
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
// Trust that the new code has no new bugs
new_code(user_config);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Techniques ==
Here are some defensive programming techniques:

=== Intelligent source code reuse ===
If existing code is tested and known to work, reusing it may reduce the chance of bugs being introduced.

However, reusing code is not ''always'' a good practice, because it also amplifies the damages of a potential attack on the initial code. {{clarify span|Reuse in this case may cause serious [[business process]] bugs.|plain=Busy logic bugs and security bugs are different things. The original text here explicitly talked about business logic, and it's still not clear what the problem is with reuse in business logic.|date=December 2016}}

==== Legacy problems ====
Before reusing old source code, libraries, APIs, configurations and so forth, it must be considered if the old work is valid for reuse, or if it is likely to be prone to [[Legacy system|legacy]] problems.

Legacy problems are problems inherent when old designs are expected to work with today's requirements, especially when the old designs were not developed or tested with those requirements in mind.

Many software products have experienced problems with old legacy source code, for example:
* [[Legacy code]] may not have been designed under a defensive programming initiative, and might therefore be of much lower quality than newly designed source code.
* Legacy code may have been written and tested under conditions which no longer apply. The old quality assurance tests may have no validity any more.
** '''Example 1''': legacy code may have been designed for ASCII input but now the input is UTF-8.
** '''Example 2''': legacy code may have been compiled and tested on 32-bit architectures, but when compiled on 64-bit architectures new arithmetic problems may occur (e.g. invalid signedness tests, invalid type casts, etc.).
** '''Example 3''': legacy code may have been targeted for offline machines, but becomes vulnerable once network connectivity is added.
* Legacy code is not written with new problems in mind. For example, source code written about 1990 is likely to be prone to many [[code injection]] vulnerabilities, because most such problems were not widely understood at that time.

Notable examples of the legacy problem:
* [[BIND|BIND 9]], presented by Paul Vixie and David Conrad as "BINDv9 is a [[Rewrite (programming)|complete rewrite]]", "Security was a key consideration in design",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://impressive.net/archives/fogo/20001005080818.O15286@impressive.net|title=fogo archive: Paul Vixie and David Conrad on BINDv9 and Internet Security by Gerald Oskoboiny &lt;gerald@impressive.net&gt;|website=impressive.net|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; naming security, robustness, scalability and new protocols as key concerns for rewriting old legacy code.
* [[Microsoft Windows]] suffered from "the" [[Windows Metafile vulnerability]] and other exploits related to the WMF format. Microsoft Security Response Center describes the WMF-features as ''"Around 1990, WMF support was added... This was a different time in the security landscape... were all completely trusted"'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.technet.com/msrc/archive/2006/01/13/417431.aspx|title=Looking at the WMF issue, how did it get there?|work=MSRC|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; not being developed under the security initiatives at Microsoft.
* [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] is combating legacy problems, such as old source code written without addressing concerns of [[SQL injection]] and [[privilege escalation]], resulting in many security vulnerabilities which has taken time to fix and also generated incomplete fixes. This has given rise to heavy criticism from security experts such as [[David Litchfield]], [[Alexander Kornbrust]], [[Cesar Cerrudo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://seclists.org/lists/bugtraq/2006/May/0039.html|title=Bugtraq: Oracle, where are the patches???|last=Litchfield|first=David|website=seclists.org|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://seclists.org/lists/bugtraq/2006/May/0045.html|title=Bugtraq: RE: Oracle, where are the patches???|last=Alexander|first=Kornbrust|date=|website=seclists.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://seclists.org/lists/bugtraq/2006/May/0083.html|title=Bugtraq: Re: [Full-disclosure] RE: Oracle, where are the patches???|last=Cerrudo|first=Cesar|date=|website=seclists.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional criticism is that default installations (largely a legacy from old versions) are not aligned with their own security recommendations, such as [http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/database-security/pdf/twp_security_checklist_database.pdf Oracle Database Security Checklist], which is hard to amend as many applications require the less secure legacy settings to function correctly.

=== Canonicalization ===
Malicious users are likely to invent new kinds of representations of incorrect data. For example, if a program attempts to reject accessing the file "/etc/[[Passwd (file)|passwd]]", a cracker might pass another variant of this file name, like "/etc/./passwd". [[Canonicalization]] libraries can be employed to avoid bugs due to non-[[Canonical form|canonical]] input.

=== Low tolerance against "potential" bugs ===
Assume that code constructs that appear to be problem prone (similar to known vulnerabilities, etc.) are bugs and potential security flaws.  The basic rule of thumb is: "I'm not aware of all types of [[security exploit]]s.  I must protect against those I ''do'' know of and then I must be proactive!".

===Other techniques===
&lt;!-- Please expand this article. These random notes should be changed to a more coherent article. --&gt;
* One of the most common problems is unchecked use of constant-size structures and functions for dynamic-size data (the [[buffer overflow]] problem). This is especially common for [[string (computer programming)|string]] data in [[C (programming language)|C]]. C library functions like &lt;tt&gt;gets&lt;/tt&gt; should never be used since the maximum size of the input buffer is not passed as an argument. C library functions like &lt;tt&gt;scanf&lt;/tt&gt; can be used safely, but require the programmer to take care with the selection of safe format strings, by sanitising it before using it.
* Encrypt/authenticate all important data transmitted over networks.  Do not attempt to implement your own encryption scheme, but use a proven one instead.
* All data is important until proven otherwise.
* All data is tainted until proven otherwise.
* All code is insecure until proven otherwise.
** You cannot prove the security of any code in [[userland (computing)|userland]], or, more canonically: ''"never trust the client"''.
* If data are to be checked for correctness, verify that they are correct, not that they are incorrect.
* [[Design by contract]]
** Design by contract uses [[precondition]]s, [[postcondition]]s and [[Invariant (computer science)|invariants]] to ensure that provided data (and the state of the program as a whole) is sanitized.  This allows code to document its assumptions and make them safely.  This may involve checking arguments to a function or method for validity before executing the body of the function.  After the body of a function, doing a check of object state (in [[object-oriented programming]] languages) or other held data and the return value before exits (break/return/throw/error code) is also wise.
* [[Assertion (computing)|Assertions]]
** Within functions, you may want to check that you are not referencing something that is not valid (i.e., null) and that array lengths are valid before referencing elements, especially on all temporary/local instantiations. A good heuristic is to not trust the libraries you did not write either. So any time you call them, check what you get back from them. It often helps to create a small library of "asserting" and "checking" functions to do this along with a logger so you can trace your path and reduce the need for extensive [[debugging]] cycles in the first place. With the advent of logging libraries and [[aspect oriented programming]], many of the tedious aspects of defensive programming are mitigated.
* Prefer [[Exception handling|exceptions]] to return codes
** Generally speaking, it is preferable to throw intelligible exception messages that enforce part of your [[application programming interface|API]] contract and guide the client [[programmer]] instead of returning values that a client programmer is likely to be unprepared for and hence minimize their complaints and increase robustness and security of your software. {{Dubious|date=June 2015}}

'''Display rules''' are a social group or culture's informal norms that distinguish how one should express themselves.They can be described as culturally prescribed rules that people learn early on in their lives by interactions and socializations with other people.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Safdar|first=Saba|last2=Matsumoto|first2=David|date=2009|title=Variations of Emotional Display Rules Within and Across Cultures: A Comparison Between Canada, USA, and Japan|url=http://davidmatsumoto.com/content/2009SafdaretalCanadianJBehaviouralScience.pdf|journal=Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science|doi=10.1037/a0014387|pmid=|access-date=2015-04-16|volume=41|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; They learn these cultural standards at a young age which determine when one would express certain emotions, where and to what extent.

Emotions can be conveyed through both non-verbal interactions such as facial expressions, hand gestures and body language as well as verbal interactions. People are able to intensify emotions in certain situations such as smiling widely even when they receive a gift that they are not happy about or “masking” their negative emotions with a polite smile. As well, people learn to de-intensify emotions in situations such as suppressing the urge to laugh when somebody falls or neutralizing their emotions such as maintaining a serious poker face after being dealt a good hand.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social psychology|last=Thomas|first=Gilovich|others=Keltner, Dacher,, Chen, Serena,, Nisbett, Richard E.|isbn=9780393938968|edition= Fourth|location=New York|oclc=794032898|year = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Display rules determine how we act and to what extent an emotion is expressed in any given situation. They are often used to protect one’s own feelings or those of another person.

The understanding of display rules is a complex, multifaceted task. Display rules are understood differentially depending upon their mode of expression (verbal/facial) and the motivation for their use (prosocial/self-protective).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gnepp | first1 = J. | last2 = Hess | first2 = D.L.R. | year = 1986 | title = Children's understanding of verbal and facial display rules | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 103–108 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.22.1.103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emotion ==
[[Emotions]] can be defined as brief, specific and multidimensional responses to challenges or opportunities that are important to both personal and social goals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Emotions last up to a few seconds or minutes, and not hours or days.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Manstead, A. (2007). Emotion. In R. F. Baumeister &amp; K. D. Vohs (Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of social psychology'' (Vol. 1, pp. 286-291). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications Ltd. doi: 10.4135/9781412956253.n175&lt;/ref&gt; Emotions are very specific which suggest that there is a clear reason of why a person may be feeling a certain emotion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Emotions are also used to help individuals achieve their social goals. Individuals may respond to certain challenges or opportunities during social interactions with different emotions. The selected emotions can guide a specific goal-directed behaviour that can either support or hinder social relationships.

=== Concepts of emotion ===
Emotions can be broken down into different components. The first component of emotion is the appraisal stage.  In this first stage, individual process an event and its impact on their personal goals. Depending on the outcome, the individual will either go through positive or negative feelings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Next, we have distinct physiological responses such as blushing, increased heart rate or sweating.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The next stage of emotion is the expressive behavior. Vocal or facial expressions follows an emotional state and serves to communicate their reactions or intentions (social). The next component is the subjective feeling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is the quality that defines the experience of a specific emotion by expressing it by words or other methods. Finally, the last component is action tendencies. This suggests that an emotion will motivate or guide specific behavior and bodily responses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Theories of emotion ===
Emotions can be expressed verbally, with facial expression and with gestures. Darwin’s hypothesis concerning emotion stated that the way emotions are expressed are universal, and therefore independent of culture.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Ekman and Frinsen conducted a study to test this theory. The study included introducing basic emotions found in the western world and introduced them to different cultures around the world (Japan, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and the United States).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Across the 5 cultures they were all able to accurately determine the emotion (success rates of 70-90%).They also introduced these selected emotions to an isolated community in Papua New Guinea who was not in contact with the western world.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The results revealed that both the other cultures and isolated community could effectively match and detect the emotional meaning of the different faces. This became evidence that emotions are expressed facially in the same way across the world.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; To see other theories: [[Emotions]].

Culture is defined as "shared behaviors, beliefs, attitudes, and values communicated from generation to generation via language or some other means."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matsumoto|first=David|date=November 3, 1990|title=Cultural Similarities and Differences in Display Rules|url=http://www.davidmatsumoto.com/content/1990%20Cultural%20Similarities%20and%20Differences%20in%20Display%20Rules.pdf|journal=Motivation and Emotion|volume=14|issue=3|pages=195–214|doi=10.1007/bf00995569}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unique individuals within cultures acquire differences affecting displays of emotions emphasized by one's status, role, and diverse behaviours. Some cultures value certain emotions more over others. The [[affect theory]] argues that emotions that promote important cultural ideals will become focal in their social interactions. For example in America, they value the emotion excitement as it represents the cultural idea of independence. In many Asian cultures it is inappropriate to discuss personal enthusiasms. They place greater value on emotions such as calmness and contentedness, representing the ideal harmonious relationships.These different cultural values affect a person’s everyday behaviours, decisions and emotional display.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

People learn how to greet one another, how to interact with others, what, where, when and how to display emotions through the people they interact with and the place they grow up in. Everything can be traced back to one’s culture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Gestures is an example of how one may express themselves, however these gestures represent different meanings depending on the culture. For example, in Canada, sticking out your tongue is a sign of disgust or disapproval however in Tibet it is a sign of respect when greeting someone. In America, holding your middle finger and index finger up makes the [[V sign|peace sign]], in some countries such as the UK and Australia it a sign of disrespect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.busuu.com/what-hand-gestures-mean-in-different-countries/|title=: What hand gestures mean in different countries - busuu blog|website=blog.busuu.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[High- and low-context cultures|High and low-contact cultures]] also vary in the amount of physical interaction and direct contact there is during one-on-one communication. High-contact cultures involve people practicing direct eye contact, frequent touching, physical contact, and having close proximity to others. Examples of countries that have a high-contact culture include Mexico, Italy, and Brazil. Low-contact cultures involve people who practice less direct eye contact, little touching, have indirect body orientation, and more physical distance between people. Examples of countries that have a low-contact culture include the United States, Canada, and Japan.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Choices &amp; Connections: An Introduction to Communication|last=McCornack|first=Steven|publisher=Bedford/St.Martin's|year=2015|isbn=978-1-319-04352-0|location=Boston|pages=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social Influence ==

=== Family and Peers ===
Ekman and Friesen (1975) have suggested that unwritten codes or "display rules" govern the manner in which emotions may be expressed, and that different rules may be internalized as a function of an individual's culture, gender or family background.&lt;ref&gt;Ekman, P., &amp; Friesen, W. V. ''Unmasking the face''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, many different cultures necessitate that particular emotions should be masked and that other emotions should be expressed drastically. Emotions can have significant consequences on the founding of [[interpersonal relationships]].

Children's understanding and use of display rules is strongly associated with their social competence and surrounding.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mcdowell, D. J., &amp; Parke, R. D.|date=2005|title=Parental Control and Affect as Predictors of Childrens Display Rule Use and Social Competence with Peers|journal=Social Development|volume=14 |issue=3|pages=440–457|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9507.2005.00310.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many personal display rules are learned in the context of a particular family or experience; many expressive behaviour and rule displays are adopted by copying or adopting similar behaviours than their social and familial surrounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malatesta|first1=C.Z.|last2=Haviland|first2=J.M.|year=1982|title=Learning display rules: The socialization of emotion expression in infancy|url=|journal=Child Development|volume=53|issue=4|pages=991–1003|doi=10.2307/1129139|pmid=7128264|jstor=1129139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents' affect and control influence their children's display rule through both positive and negative responses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Mcdowell and Parke (2005) suggested that parents who exert more control over their children's emotions/behaviour would deprive them if many opportunities to learn about appropriate vs. inappropriate emotional/rule displays.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hence, by depriving children from learning through control (i.e. not allowing them to learn from their own mistakes), parents are restraining children's learning of prosocial rule display.

The social environment can influence whether one controls or displays their emotions. There are few factors influencing the children's decision to either control or express an emotion that they are experiencing including the type of audience. In fact, depending on if children are in the presence of peers or of family (i.e. mother or father), they will report different control over their expression of emotions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeman|first=Janice|last2=Garber|first2=Judy|date=1996|title=Display Rules for Anger, Sadness, and Pain: It Depends on Who Is Watching|jstor=1131873|journal=Child Development|volume=67|issue=3|pages=957–973|doi=10.2307/1131873}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the type of emotion experienced, children control significantly more their expression of emotion in the presence of peers than when they are with their caregiver or alone.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== School Environment ===
The school environment is also a place where emotions and behaviours are influenced. During a child's grade school years, they can become increasingly more aware of the accepted display rules that are found in their social environment. They learn more and more about which emotions to express and which emotions not to express in certain social situations at school.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social and Personality Development, Sixth Edition|last=Shaffer|first=David R.|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth|year=2009|isbn=|location=USA|pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emotions and Social Relationships  ===
Emotions can serve as a way of communicating with others and can guide social interactions.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/socialpsychology/n177.xml|title=Encyclopedia of Social Psychology|last=Brackett|first=Marc A.|last2=Salovey|first2=Peter|date=2007|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=294|doi=10.4135/9781412956253.n177|chapter=Emotional Intelligence|isbn=9781412916707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being able to express or understand other emotions can help encourage social interactions and help achieve personal goals. When expressing or understanding one's emotions is difficult, social interactions can be negatively impacted.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Emotional Intelligence is a concept that is defined by four skills:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

1.     The ability to accurately perceive other emotions.

2.     The ability to understand one’s own emotions.

3.     The ability to use current feelings to help in making decisions.

4.     The ability to manage one’s emotions to best match the current situation.

== Gender ==
Gender also plays a role in display rules and how emotions are expressed. Males are more likely than females to reveal their emotions during frazzled and frightened times. Females on the other hand display their emotions more frequently under many circumstances regarding feelings caused from various emotions. However, both sexes in general due to [[human nature]] and the way we have socially developed, regulate emotional displays in an intellectual sensitivity to others assessments. This is done in regard to amalgamation or fitting into the prevailing societal formation which surrounds our environment.

== Development of Display Rules ==
{{See also|Social emotional development}}
Age plays an important role in the development of display rules, throughout life a person will gain experience and have more social interactions. According to a study  by Jones,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Diane Carlson|last2=Abbey|first2=Belynda Bowling|last3=Cumberland|first3=Amanda|date=1998|title=The Development of Display Rule Knowledge: Linkages with Family Expressiveness and Social Competence|jstor=1132370|journal=Child Development|volume=69|issue=4|pages=1209–1222|doi=10.2307/1132370}}&lt;/ref&gt; social interactions are the main factor in the creation and understanding of display rules. It starts at a very young age with family, and continues with peers. By meeting more people, facing more challenges and advancing in life, a person will develop different responses, those responses will depend mostly on the age of the person, this explains why a young person will have different social interactions than someone older.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McConatha|first=Jasmin Tahmaseb|last2=Huba|first2=Haley M.|date=1999-06-01|title=Primary, secondary, and emotional control across adulthood|journal=Current Psychology|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=164–170|doi=10.1007/s12144-999-1025-z|issn=0737-8262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infancy ===
Infancy is a complex period when studying display rules. At a very young age, an [[infant]] does not know how to talk, therefore they express themselves in different ways. In order to communicate with others, they use facial and vocal displays that are specific for each age-period. A study conducted by Malatesta &amp; Haviland&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zander Malatesta|first=Carol|last2=M. Haviland|first2=Jeannette|date=1982-09-01|title=Learning Display Rules: The Socialization of Emotion Expression in Infancy|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/16071343|journal=Child Development|volume=53|issue=4|pages=991–1003|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1982.tb01363.x|pmid=7128264}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that a baby can have 10 different categories for facial expression:
* Interest
* Enjoyment
* Surprise
* Sadness/distress
* Anger
* Knit brow
* Discomfort/pain
* Brow flash
* Fear
* Disgusting
However, [[Fear]] and [[Disgust]], will develop progressively during childhood. They are complex facial expressions that require knowledge and understanding, they must be learned and cannot be copied; this is why not everybody is afraid of the same things. Most of the facial expressions will be learned through the parents, mainly from the mother. The mother-infant&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; relationship is key in the development of display rules during infancy, it is the synchrony of mother-infant expressions. To express themselves vocally; babies require the use of “screaming” or “crying”. There is no differentiation for the request of a baby, this is why the relation with the parents is important, they must teach the infant when and for what reason to cry (i.e. need of food).

=== Childhood ===
During [[childhood]], the expression of display rules becomes more complex. Children develop the ability to modulate their emotional expressions growing up, this development depends on the level of maturity and the level of [[Social relation|social interactions]] with others. Children growing up start to become aware of oneself and slowly aware of others. At this time, they understand the importance of non-verbal communication, and shape the manner in which emotion may be expressed, with this change in perception, children will internalize different rules. Those rules are relative to two major factors:
* The [[Social environment|environment]]: The social environment impacts the way someone reacts emotionally. The audience and the context are essential to understand display rules among children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeman|first=Janice|last2=Garber|first2=Judy|date=1996-06-01|title=Display Rules for Anger, Sadness, and Pain: It Depends on Who Is Watching|journal=Child Development|language=en|volume=67|issue=3|pages=957–973|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1996.tb01776.x|issn=1467-8624}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[temperament]]: According to [https://www.bu.edu/psych/faculty/lesbro/ Leslie Brody], parents that [[Socialization|socialise]] their kids the same way with equal level of nurturance, will observe different responses and reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tS1C8Sl5ysEC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=temperament+and+display+rules#v=onepage&amp;q=temperament%20and%20display%20rules&amp;f=false|title=Gender and Emotion: Social Psychological Perspectives|last=Fischer|first=Agneta|date=2000-03-09|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521639866|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These two factors will help create “personal display rules” and the development of a sense of [[empathy]] toward others (i.e. feeling sad when a friend lost a relative even if you did not know the person).

This process will continue to change and grow until adulthood. During adolescence, a transition period where the person is not a child anymore but not an adult yet, is a test period as they learn to deal with internal conflict. Emotions are more intense and harder to control due to the hormonal changes that come at this period of time.

=== Adulthood ===
During adulthood, people are capable of using a lot of different display rules depending on the situation they are facing and the people they are with. Society governs how and when someone should express emotions, however display rules are not something static, they are in a constant evolution. Therefore, even during adulthood, a person will develop new ways to hide, express or cope with emotions. At the same time, adults will develop a greater control of their feelings and this can be seen mostly in the work environment. A study presented by the [[Journal of Occupational Health Psychology]] showed that nurses working in the same environment are more likely to share the same display rules in order to achieve an organisational objective. Display rules are not only personal, but they are shared between people and can differ according to the hierarchy of the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diefendorff|first=James M.|last2=Erickson|first2=Rebecca J.|last3=Grandey|first3=Alicia A.|last4=Dahling|first4=Jason J.|date=April 2011|title=Emotional display rules as work unit norms: a multilevel analysis of emotional labor among nurses|journal=Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|volume=16|issue=2|pages=170–186|doi=10.1037/a0021725|issn=1939-1307|pmid=21244168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3609">In [[United States patent law]], the '''doctrine of inherency''' holds that, under certain circumstances, [[prior art]] may be relied upon not only for what it expressly teaches, but also for what is inherent therein, i.e., what necessarily flows from the express teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2112.html MPEP § 2112]&lt;/ref&gt; For a [[patent]] [[claim (patent)|claim]] to be valid, its subject-matter must be [[novelty (patent)|novel]] and [[inventive step and non-obviousness|non-obvious]]. The claim is anticipated (i.e. will fail because its subject-matter is not novel) if a single [[prior art]] reference, either expressly or inherently, discloses every feature of the claimed invention. The concept of inherency is predicated on the idea that a claim should not pass the test of anticipation merely because a feature of it is undisclosed or unrecognized in the prior art reference. A prior art source may thus still anticipate if an apparently missing element of the claim is inherent in that prior art source.

Procedurally, to rely on the doctrine of inherency, one must provide a basis in fact and/or technical reasoning supporting a determination that an allegedly inherent characteristic necessarily would be present if the teachings of the prior art were followed, even if the inherent feature would not have been recognized.

The fact that a certain result or characteristic may occur or be present in the prior art is not alone sufficient to establish inherency of that result or characteristic. To establish inherency, the evidence must make clear that the missing matter is ''necessarily'' present in the prior art reference.  Inherency may not be established by probabilities or possibilities.

Once the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) establishes that a product referenced in prior art appears to be substantially identical, the burden shifts to the applicant to show a non-obvious difference.

The doctrine of inherency is typically invoked when an [[inventor (patent)|inventor]] tries to obtain a ''product'' patent for a product that had been unintentionally invented earlier ("accidental anticipation").

The [[United States Supreme Court]] held in ''[[Tilghman v. Proctor]]'' that where the first, accidental producer was not aware of the product and did not attempt to produce it, the first production did not bar a patent on the subsequent "invention" of the product. 102 U.S. 707 (1880).

The use of the doctrine of inherency in a determination of obviousness is more complicated because "[t]hat which may be inherent is not necessarily known and that which is unknown cannot be obvious."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20170801178 ''Honeywell International Inc. v. Mexichem Amanco Holding,'' 865 F.3d 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2017)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A patent applicant may use the doctrine of inherency to respond to a rejection for [[Sufficiency_of_disclosure#Written_description_and_possession|lack of an adequate written description]] by showing that the [[patent application]] inherently includes the disclosure that is allegedly lacking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2163.html MPEP § 2163]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], an '''element''', or '''member''', of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is any one of the distinct [[Mathematical object|objects]] that make up that set.

==Sets==
Writing &lt;math&gt;A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}&lt;/math&gt; means that the elements of the set {{mvar|A}} are the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Sets of elements of {{mvar|A}}, for example &lt;math&gt;\{1, 2\}&lt;/math&gt;, are [[subset]]s of {{mvar|A}}.

Sets can themselves be elements. For example, consider the set &lt;math&gt;B = \{1, 2, \{3, 4\}\}&lt;/math&gt;. The elements of {{mvar|B}} are ''not'' 1, 2, 3, and&amp;nbsp;4.  Rather, there are only three elements of {{mvar|B}}, namely the numbers 1 and 2, and the set &lt;math&gt;\{3, 4\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The elements of a set can be anything. For example, &lt;math&gt;C = \{\mathrm{\color{red}red}, \mathrm{\color{green}green}, \mathrm{\color{blue}blue}\}&lt;/math&gt;, is the set whose elements are the colors {{red|red}}, {{green|green}} and {{blue|blue}}.

==Notation and terminology==
[[File:First usage of the symbol ∈.png|thumb|right|First usage of the symbol ϵ in the work {{lang|la|[[Arithmetices principia, nova methodo exposita]]|italic=yes}} by [[Giuseppe Peano]].]]
The [[heterogeneous relation |relation]] "is an element of", also called '''set membership''', is denoted by the symbol&amp;nbsp;"&lt;math&gt; \in &lt;/math&gt;". Writing

:&lt;math&gt;x \in A &lt;/math&gt;

means that "''x'' is an element of&amp;nbsp;''A''". Equivalent expressions are "''x'' is a member of&amp;nbsp;''A''", "''x'' belongs to&amp;nbsp;''A''", "''x'' is in&amp;nbsp;''A''" and "''x'' lies in&amp;nbsp;''A''". The expressions "''A'' includes ''x''" and "''A'' contains ''x''" are also used to mean set membership, however some authors use them to mean instead "''x'' is a [[subset]] of&amp;nbsp;''A''".&lt;ref name="schech"&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Eric Schechter]] |title= Handbook of Analysis and Its Foundations |publisher= [[Academic Press]] |year= 1997|isbn= 0-12-622760-8 }} p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Logician [[George Boolos]] strongly urged that "contains" be used for membership only and "includes" for the subset relation only.&lt;ref name="boolos"&gt;{{cite speech |title=24.243 Classical Set Theory (lecture) |author=[[George Boolos]] |date=February 4, 1992 |location=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the relation ϵ , the [[converse relation]] ϵ&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; may be written

:&lt;math&gt;A \ni x ,&lt;/math&gt; meaning "''A'' contains ''x''".

The [[negation]] of set membership is denoted by the symbol&amp;nbsp;"∉". Writing
:&lt;math&gt;x \notin A&lt;/math&gt; means that "''x'' is not an element of&amp;nbsp;''A''".

The symbol ϵ was first used by Giuseppe Peano 1889 in his work {{lang|la|[[Arithmetices principia, nova methodo exposita]]|italic=yes}}. Here he wrote on page X:

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|la|Signum ϵ significat est. Ita a ϵ b legitur a est quoddam b; ...}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

which means

&lt;blockquote&gt;The symbol ϵ means ''is''. So a ϵ b is read as a ''is a'' b; ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The symbol itself is a stylized lowercase Greek letter [[epsilon]] ("ε"), the first letter of the word {{wikt-lang|grc|ἐστί}}, which means "is".

The [[Unicode]] characters for these symbols are U+2208 ('element of'), U+2209 ('not an element of'), U+220B ('contains as member') and U+220C ('does not contain as member'). The equivalent [[LaTeX]] commands are "\in", "\notin", "\ni" and "\not\ni". [[Mathematica]] has commands "\[Element]", "\[NotElement]", "\[ReverseElement]" and "\[NotReverseElement]".

===Complement and converse===
Every relation ''R'' : ''U'' → ''V'' is subject to two [[involution (mathematics)|involution]]s: complementation ''R'' → &lt;math&gt;\bar{R}&lt;/math&gt; and conversion ''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;:''V'' → ''U''.
The relation ∈ has for its domain a universal set ''U'', and has the [[power set]] '''P'''(''U'') for its codomain or range. The complementary relation &lt;math&gt;\bar{\in} \ = \ \notin&lt;/math&gt; expresses the opposite of ∈. An element ''x'' ∈ ''U'' may have ''x'' ∉ ''A'', in which case ''x'' ∈ ''U'' \ ''A'', the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of ''A'' in ''U''.

The [[converse relation]] &lt;math&gt;\in^T \ = \ \ni&lt;/math&gt; swaps the domain and range with ∈. For any ''A'' in '''P'''(''U''), &lt;math&gt;A \ni x&lt;/math&gt; is true when ''x'' ∈ ''A''.

==Cardinality of sets==
{{main|Cardinality}}
The number of elements in a particular set is a property known as [[cardinality]]; informally, this is the size of a set. In the above examples the cardinality of the set&amp;nbsp;''A'' is&amp;nbsp;4, while the cardinality of either of the sets ''B'' and ''C'' is&amp;nbsp;3. An infinite set is a set with an infinite number of elements, while a finite set is a set with a finite number of elements. The above examples are examples of finite sets. An example of an infinite set is the set of positive integers =&amp;nbsp;{&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;}.

==Examples==
Using the sets defined above, namely ''A'' = {1, 2, 3, 4 }, ''B'' = {1, 2, {3, 4}} and ''C'' = { red, green, blue }:
*2 ∈ ''A''
*{3,4} ∈ ''B''
*3,4 ∉ ''B''
*{3,4} is a member of ''B''
*Yellow ∉ ''C''
*The cardinality of ''D''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{2,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;8,&amp;nbsp;10,&amp;nbsp;12} is finite and equal to&amp;nbsp;5.
*The cardinality of ''P''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;5,&amp;nbsp;7,&amp;nbsp;11,&amp;nbsp;13,&amp;nbsp;...} (the [[prime numbers]]) is infinite&amp;nbsp;(proved by [[Euclid]]).

Frans van der Hoff's contacts with disadvantaged Mexican coffee producers were key in securing the supply and ensuring the success of the very first [[Fairtrade certification]] initiative.

Frans van der Hoff was born as the 7th of 17th children of a disciplined farming family ''Van der Hoff-Boersma'' that had moved from [[Friesland]] to the village [[De Rips]] in the southern Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://culemborg.pvda.nl/2015/06/02/grondlegger-max-havelaar-keurmerk-komt-naar-culemborg/ Grondlegger Max Havelaar keurmerk komt naar Culemborg] {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became politically active early on in student movements during his studies at [[Radboud University Nijmegen]]. He later received a [[Ph.D.]] in [[political economy]] and another one in [[theology]] while studying in [[Germany]]. In 1970, van der Hoff moved to [[Santiago de Chile]] to work in the [[barrio]]s as a [[worker-priest]]. During the [[Chilean coup of 1973|1973 coup]], van der Hoff moved to [[Mexico]] to continue his work in the slums of [[Mexico City]]. Seven years later, he moved to [[Oaxaca]] in the Southern part of [[Mexico]]. As a worker-priest, he quickly integrated the community and started to learn about the misery and economic hardship of local [[coffee]] producers. In 1981, he participates in the launch of UCIRI ([[Union de Comunidades Indigenas de la Region del Istmo]]), a coffee producer [[cooperative]] created to bypass local traders (also called ''coyotes'') and pool resources.

In 1985, van der Hoff met [[Nico Roozen]] at the [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] train station through a mutual friend. Roozen, who was then responsible for business development at [[ecumenical]] [[development agency]] [[Solidaridad]], quickly became interested in van der Hoff's work.&lt;ref&gt;Jan van der Kaaij (2004).

URL accessed on September 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 15, 1988, the two launched together the first Fairtrade labelling initiative, [[Stichting Max Havelaar|Max Havelaar]]. The initiative offered disadvantaged [[coffee]] producers following various social and environmental standards a fair price, significantly above the market price, for their crop. The [[coffee]], originating from the UCIRI cooperative, was imported by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] company [[Van Weely]], roasted by [[Neuteboom]] and then sold directly to [[world shops]] and retailers across the [[Netherlands]]. The initiative was a great success and was replicated in several other markets.

In 2006, Fairtrade-certified sales amounted to approximately €1.6 billion worldwide&lt;ref name="URL accessed on May 24, 2007"&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (2007). www.fairtrade.net.

==Awards==
Van der Hoff was awarded the 2006 [[North-South Prize]] by the [[Council of Europe]].

Van der Hoff was appointed Commander in the [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)]] by the Belgian Minister of Development Cooperation in 2006.

Van der Hoff received in 2006 an honorary doctorate from the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium for his efforts to establish a 'different economy'.

In 2006 he was awarded the Groeneveldprize from the Groeneveld Foundation in the Netherlands, for his special efforts for nature and the preservation of the environment.

He was named [[Chevalier of the Legion of Honor]] by French president Chirac in 2005.

The '''fundamental theorem of poker''' is a principle first articulated by [[David Sklansky]] that he believes expresses the essential nature of [[poker]] as a [[game]] of [[decision-making]] in the face of [[incomplete information]]. 

{{Cquote|Every time you play a hand differently from the way you would have played it if you could see all your opponents' cards, they gain; and every time you play your hand the same way you would have played it if you could see all their cards, they lose. Conversely, every time opponents play their hands differently from the way they would have if they could see all your cards, you gain; and every time they play their hands the same way they would have played if they could see all your cards, you lose.}}

The fundamental theorem is stated in common language, but its formulation is based on mathematical reasoning. Each decision that is made in poker can be analyzed in terms of the [[expected value]] of the payoff of a decision. The correct decision to make in a given situation is the decision that has the largest expected value. If a player could see all of their opponents' cards, they would always be able to calculate the correct decision with mathematical certainty, and the less they deviate from these correct decisions, the better their expected long-term results. This is certainly true [[poker jargon#H|heads-up]], but [[Morton's theorem]], in which an opponent's correct decision can benefit a player, may apply in multi-way pots. 

In probabilistic terms, this is an application of the [[law of total expectation]].

==An example==
Suppose Bob is playing limit [[Texas hold 'em]] and is dealt '''9♣ 9♠''' [[poker jargon#under_the_gun|under the gun]] before the [[flop (poker)|flop]]. He [[Call (poker)|calls]], and everyone else [[Fold (poker)|folds]] to Carol in the [[big blind]] who [[Check (poker)|checks]]. The flop comes '''A♣ &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;K♦ 10♦&lt;/span&gt;''', and Carol bets.

Bob now has a decision to make based upon incomplete information. In this particular circumstance, the correct decision is almost certainly to fold. There are too many [[Turn cards|turn]] and [[river cards]] that could kill his hand. Even if Carol does not have an '''A''' or a '''K''', there are 3 cards to a [[Straight (poker)|straight]] and 2 cards to a [[Flush (poker)|flush]] on the flop, and she could easily be on a straight or flush [[Draw (poker)|draw]]. Bob is essentially drawing to 2 [[Out (poker)|outs]] (another '''9'''), and even if he catches one of these outs, his set may not hold up.

However, suppose Bob knew (with 100% certainty) that Carol held '''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;8♦ 7♦&lt;/span&gt;'''. In this case, it would be correct to [[Raise (poker)|''raise'']]. Even though Carol would still be getting the correct [[pot odds]] to call, the best decision for Bob is to raise. Therefore, by folding (or even calling), Bob has played his hand differently from the way he would have played it if he could see his opponent's cards, and so by the Fundamental Theorem of Poker, his opponent has gained. Bob has made a "mistake", in the sense that he has played differently from the way he would have played if he knew Carol held '''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;8♦ 7♦&lt;/span&gt;''', even though this "mistake" is almost certainly the best decision given the incomplete information available to him.

This example also illustrates that one of the most important goals in poker is to induce the opponents to make mistakes. In this particular hand, Carol has practiced deception by employing a [[semi-bluff]] &amp;mdash; she has bet a hand, hoping Bob will fold, but she still has outs even if he calls or raises. Carol has induced Bob to make a mistake.

==Multi-way pots and implicit collusion==
The Fundamental Theorem of Poker applies to all [[poker jargon#H|heads-up]] decisions, but it does not apply to all multi-way decisions. This is because each opponent of a player can make an incorrect decision, but the "collective decision" of all the opponents works against the player.

This type of situation occurs mostly in games with multi-way pots, when a player has a strong hand, but several opponents are chasing with [[Draw (poker)|draws]] or other weaker hands. Also, a good example is a player with a deep stack making a play that favors a [[Poker glossary#short stack|short-stacked]] opponent because he can extract more [[expected value]] from the other deep-stacked opponents. Such a situation is sometimes referred to as [[Morton's theorem|implicit collusion]]. 

The Fundamental Theorem of Poker is simply expressed and appears axiomatic, yet its proper application to the countless varieties of circumstances that a poker player may face requires a great deal of knowledge, skill, and experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3872">A '''gift registry''' is a particular type of wish list in Western countries....

==Description==
Typically, when a recipient compiles a list of items they wish to receive and then distributes it to family and friends, they have created a wish list. A registry, on the other hand, is made public, and the retailer or registry system provider removes items from the list as they are purchased.{{cn|date=August 2015}}  Registry managers will often not divulge who has purchased the registered items.{{cn|date=August 2015}} In the [[United Kingdom]], a gift registry is frequently referred to as a '''"gift list"''' and has become an established part of British weddings,  with the service often provided by most [[department stores]].&lt;ref name = "Gift Lists in UK"&gt;{{cite news | title = Royal wedding: What's the point of a gift list? | date = 2011-04-27 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13003916 | work = bbc.co.uk | accessdate = 2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Retailer-specific versus multiple retailers==
Traditionally, registries were limited to the stock of a given retailer, which maintained the list for the registrant and ensured that items were removed from the list as they were purchased. 

However, online gift registries that are not specific to any retailer have become an increasingly popular alternative to retailer-specific registries, as the former offers more flexible means of adding gifts and coordinating purchases, as well as social networking capabilities. In 2004, North American [[shopping center]]s (notably [[Galleria Edina]]) began to extend this concept by offering registries that had access to multiple shops within individual centers.&lt;ref name=icsc1&gt;{{cite news | title = MALL LANDLORDS TEST CENTERWIDE GIFT REGISTRATION | date = 2004-05-01 | url = http://www.icsc.org/srch/sct/sct0504/page232.php | work = icsc.org | accessdate = 2011-08-02 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110518205508/http://www.icsc.org/srch/sct/sct0504/page232.php | archivedate = 2011-05-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals ==
A managed registry system has several goals:
#It facilitates communication between gift givers and receivers. Recipients can compile a gift registry and make it available to anyone who will present them with a gift. Gift givers can then be certain they are purchasing items the receiver will appreciate.{{cn|date=August 2015}}
#An efficiently-managed registry can prevent gift givers from giving duplicating gifts. To accomplish this, the retailer should remove each item from the registry as it is purchased.{{cn|date=August 2015}}
#The registry process should allow gift purchasers to be discreet about what they have bought. This is so the gift's recipient will not know who purchased which items until they are surprised at the time of gift giving.{{cn|date=August 2015}}
#The registry system should benefit the retailer by bringing customers to their store or website, to purchase products the merchant carries.{{cn|date=August 2015}}
#The store is often able to deliver all of the gifts to the recipients at a mutually convenient time before or after the event, for the convenience of both the givers and the recipient.

==Examples==
Gift registries are often used for a variety of occasions, such as [[anniversaries]], [[baby shower]]s, [[birthdays]], civil ceremonies, [[graduation]]s, and [[Housewarming party|housewarming parties]].{{cn|date=August 2015}} 
* For example, engaged couples use a [[bridal registry]] to indicate the pattern(s) and item(s) they desire for such product lines as china and silverware, so gift-givers will know which items to buy as wedding gifts.{{cn|date=August 2015}}
* Similarly, those purchasing a new home may register the furniture and domestic items, such as appliances, they desire for their [[Housewarming party|housewarming]].

'''ISO 7001''' ("public information symbols") is a standard published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] that defines a set of [[pictogram]]s and symbols for public information. The latest version, ISO 7001:2007, was published in November 2007.

The set is the result of extensive testing in several countries and different cultures and have met the criteria for comprehensibility set up by the ISO.  Common examples of public information symbols include those representing toilets, car parking, and information, and the [[International Symbol of Access]].

The '''Interpolation Theory''', also known as the '''Intercalation Theory''' or the '''Antithetic Theory''', is a theory that attempts to explain the origin of the [[alternation of generations]] in [[plants]].  The Interpolation Theory suggests that the [[sporophyte]] generation progenated from a [[haploid]], green [[algal]] [[thallus]] in which repeated [[mitotic]] cell divisions of a [[zygote]] produced an [[embryo]] retained on the [[thallus]] and gave rise to the [[diploid]] phase ([[sporophyte]]).  Ensuing [[evolution]] caused the [[sporophyte]] to become increasingly complex, both organographically and anatomically.

The Interpolation Theory was introduced by [[Ladislav Josef Čelakovský|Čelakovský]] (1874) as the Antithetic Theory.  Bower (1889) further developed this theory and renamed it the Interpolation Theory.  The theory was later supported by Overton (1893), Scott (1896), Strasburger (1897), Williams (1904), and others.

The gradual [[evolution]] of an independent, [[sporophyte]] phase was viewed by Bower as being closely related to the transition from aquatic to terrestrial plant life on Earth. 

Evidence supporting this theory can be found in the life cycle of modern [[Bryophytes]] in which the [[sporophyte]] is physiologically dependent on the [[gametophyte]].  Competing theories include the [[Transformation theory (biology)|Transformation theory]], which was introduced as the [[Homologous theory]] by Čelakovský, and also renamed by Bower.

'''Kunkunshi''' ({{native name|ryu|工工四}} {{IPA-ryu|kuŋkunshiː|pron}}) is the traditional notation system by which music is recorded in the [[Ryukyu Islands]]. The term ''kunkunshi'' originally referred to the first three notes of a widely known Chinese melody, although today it is used almost exclusively in reference to the sheet music.{{sfn|Garfias|1993|p=117}}

Kunkunshi is believed to have been first developed by [[Mongaku Terukina]] or by his student {{ill|Choki Yakabi|ja|屋嘉比朝寄}} in the early to mid-1700s. However, it was not until the end of the 19th century that the form became standardized for writing [[sanshin]] music.{{sfn|Thompson|2008|p=317}} Yakabi is attributed to having written the earliest known, surviving collection of kunkunshi. The ''Yakabi Kunkunshi'' consists of 117 compositions written in the ''kaki nagashi'' style. In this form, the sanshin finger positions are written in a flowing style with no indication of rhythm. {{sfnm|Thompson|2008|1p=317|Garfias|1993|2p=117}}

'''Legal archaeology''' is an area of legal scholarship "involving detailed historical reconstruction and analysis of important cases." &lt;ref name = &gt;Charles L. Knapp, Nathan M. Crystal, and Harry G. Prince, ''Problems in Contract Law: Cases and Materials: Fifth Edition'', pp. 749-50, Aspen Publishers, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

While most legal scholars confine their research to published opinions of court cases, legal archaeologists examine the historical and social context in which a court case was decided. These facts may show what social and cultural forces were at work in a particular case. Professors can use legal archaeology to "sensitize students as to how inequality, specifically with regard to race, gender and class affects what occurs throughout the cases they study." &lt;ref name = Vogel&gt;Joan Vogel, ''Cases in Context: Lake Champlain Wars, Gentrification, and Ploof v. Putnam'', 45 St. Louis U. L. J. 791, 792.&lt;/ref&gt; A legal archaeologist might also research biographical material on the judges, attorneys, and parties to a court case. Such information might show whether a judge held particular biases in a case, or if one party had superior legal representation that caused the party to prevail in a case. &lt;ref name = Maute&gt;Judith Maute, ''Response: The Values of Legal Archaeology'', 2000 Utah L.

The '''linguistic turn''' was a major development in [[Western philosophy]] during the early 20th century, the most important characteristic of which is the focusing of [[philosophy]] and the other [[humanities]] primarily on the relationship between philosophy and [[language]].

Very different intellectual movements were associated with the "linguistic turn", although the term itself is commonly thought popularised by [[Richard Rorty]]'s 1967 anthology ''The Linguistic Turn'', in which it means the turn towards [[linguistic philosophy]]. According to Rorty, who later dissociated himself from linguistic philosophy and analytic philosophy generally, the phrase "the linguistic turn" originated with philosopher [[Gustav Bergmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Rorty]], "Wittgenstein, Heidegger, and the Reification of Language" in Richard Rorty, ''Essays on Heidegger and Others: Philosophical Papers'', Cambridge University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neil Gross, ''Richard Rorty: The Making of an American Philosopher'', University Of Chicago Press, 2008, p. xxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytic philosophy==
Traditionally, the linguistic turn is taken to also mean the birth of [[analytic philosophy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38153975|title=Origins of analytical philosophy|last=Dummett|first=Michael A.|date=|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=0674644735|location=Cambridge. Mass.|pages=5|oclc=38153975}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the results of the linguistic turn was an increasing focus on [[logic]] and [[philosophy of language]], and the cleavage between [[Linguistic philosophy|ideal language philosophy]] and [[ordinary language philosophy]].

===Frege===
According to [[Michael Dummett]], the linguistic turn can be dated to [[Gottlob Frege]]'s 1884 work ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'', specifically paragraph 62 where Frege explores the identity of a numerical proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/lang-phi/#SH1b|title=Language, Philosophy of – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=|date=|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Dummett, "Frege: Philosophy of Mathematics"&lt;/ref&gt; 

In order to answer a [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] question about [[Number|numbers]], "How are numbers given to us, granted that we have no idea or intuition of them?" Frege invokes his "[[context principle]]", stated at the beginning of the book, that only in the context of a proposition do words have meaning, and thus finds the solution to be in defining "the sense of a proposition in which a number word occurs." Thus an [[Ontology|ontological]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] problem, traditionally solved along [[Idealism|idealist]] lines, is instead solved along [[Linguistics|linguistic]] ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Russell and Wittgenstein===
This concern for the logic of propositions and their relationship to "facts" was later taken up by the notable analytic philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] in "[[On Denoting]]", and played a weighty role in his early work in [[logical atomism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hist-analytic.com/RussellLAfacts.pdf The Philosophy of Physical Atomism], p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], an associate of Russell, was one of the progenitors of the linguistic turn. This follows from his ideas in his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' that philosophical problems arise from a misunderstanding of the logic of language, and from his remarks on [[Language game (philosophy)|language games]] in his later work. His later work (specifically ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'') significantly departs from the common tenets of analytic philosophy and might be viewed as having some resonance in the post-structuralist tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Although Wittgenstein never used the term Linguistic turn. See  [http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/scr/hacker/docs/Beyond%20the%20linguistic%20turn%20.pdf Analytic Philosophy: Beyond the Linguistic Turn and Back Again] (St. Johns College website)&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Quine and Kripke===
[[W. V. O. Quine]] describes the historical continuity of the linguistic turn with earlier philosophy in [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism|''Two Dogmas of Empiricism'']]: "[[Intension|Meaning]] is what [[essence]] becomes when it is divorced from the object of reference and wedded to the word."&lt;ref&gt;Quine, W. V. O. ''Two Dogmas of Empiricism''&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the twentieth century, philosophers like [[Saul Kripke]] in ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' drew metaphysical conclusions from closely analyzing language.&lt;ref name="Garrett2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Garrett|title=What Is This Thing Called Metaphysics?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTmJrtBX-ZkC&amp;pg=PA54|date=25 February 2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-79269-4|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continental philosophy ==
Decisive for the linguistic turn in the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] [[structuralism]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]. Structuralism was the initial outcome of Saussure's linguistic turn, which later led to [[poststructuralism]] with the input of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ideas.&lt;ref&gt;David Kreps, ''Bergson, Complexity and Creative Emergence'', Springer, 2015, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Influential poststructuralist theorists include [[Judith Butler]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in historical discourse was explored by [[Hayden White]].

These various movements often lead to the notion that language 'constitutes' reality, a position contrary to intuition and to most of the Western tradition of philosophy. The traditional view (what Derrida called the 'metaphysical' core of Western thought) saw words as functioning labels attached to concepts.  According to this view, there is something like 'the ''real'' chair', which exists in some external reality and corresponds roughly with a concept in human thought, ''chair'', to which the linguistic word "chair" refers. However, the founder of structuralism, Ferdinand de Saussure, held that definitions of concepts cannot exist independently from a linguistic system defined by difference, or, to put it differently, that a concept of something cannot exist without being named. Thus differences between meanings structure our perception; there is no ''real'' chair except insofar as we are manipulating symbolic systems. We would not even be able to recognize a chair ''as'' a chair without simultaneously recognising that a chair is ''not'' everything else - in other words a chair is defined as being a specific collection of characteristics which are themselves defined in certain ways, and so on, and all of this within the symbolic system of language. Thus, a large part of what we think of as ''reality'' is really a convention of naming and characterising, a convention which is itself called ''language''.

{{Marxism}}

'''''Lumpenproletariat''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|ʌ|m|p|ə|n|p|r|əʊ|l|ɪ|ˈ|t|ɛər|i|ə|t}}) is a term used primarily by [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Marxist philosophy|theorists]] to describe the [[underclass]] devoid of [[class consciousness]].&lt;ref name="Hemmerle"/&gt; Coined by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in the 1840s, they used it to refer to the "unthinking" lower strata of society exploited by [[reactionary]] and [[counter-revolutionary]] forces, particularly in the context of the [[revolutions of 1848]]. They dismissed its revolutionary potential and contrasted it with the [[proletariat]]. Among other groups criminals, [[Vagrancy (people)|vagabonds]], and [[prostitutes]] are usually included in this category.

The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] made wide use of the term by the turn of the century. [[Lenin]] and [[Trotsky]] followed Marx's arguments and dismissed its revolutionary potential, while [[Mao]] argued it can be utilized by a proper leadership. The term was popularized in the West by [[Frantz Fanon]] in the 1960s and has been adopted as a [[sociological]] term. However, its vagueness and its history as a term of abuse has led to some criticism. Some radical groups, most notably the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]] and the [[Young Lords]], have sought to mobilize the ''lumpenproletariat''.

==Overview==
===Etymology===
[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] are generally considered to have coined the term ''lumpenproletariat''.{{sfn|Bussard|1987|p=680}}{{sfn|Thoburn|2002|p=440}} It is composed of the [[German language|German]] word ''lumpen'', which is usually translated as "ragged"{{sfn|Bussard|1987|p=675}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=lumpenproletariat|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lumpenproletariat|website=[[Collins English Dictionary]]|quote=German, literally: ragged proletariat}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[proletariat|prolétariat]]'', a French word adopted as a common Marxist term for the class of wage earners in a capitalist system. [[Hal Draper]] argued that the root is ''lump'' ("knave"), not ''lumpen''.{{sfn|Thoburn|2002|p=440}} Bussard noted that the meaning of ''lump'' shifted from being a person dressed in rags in the 17th century to [[wikt:knavery|knavery]] in the 19th century.{{sfn|Bussard|1987|p=679}}

===Definition===
''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' defines it as "the lowest stratum of the proletariat. Used originally in Marxist theory to describe those members of the proletariat, especially criminals, vagrants, and the unemployed, who lacked awareness of their collective interest as an oppressed class."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=lumpenproletariat|url=https://www.thefreedictionary.com/lumpenproletariat|publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern usage, it is commonly defined to include the chronically unemployed, the homeless, and [[Habitual offender|career criminals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holt|first1=Justin P.|title=The Social Thought of Karl Marx|date=2014|publisher=[[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]|isbn=9781412997843|page=[https://books.google.am/books?id=oc45DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT117&amp;dq=dangerous+class 105]|chapter=Class}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Communist Party USA]] website defines it as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Glossary of Communist Terminology |url=https://www.cp-texas.org/glossary |website=cp-texas.org |publisher=[[Communist Party USA]] Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote frame|Generally unemployable people who make no positive contribution to an economy. Sometimes described as the bottom layer of a capitalist society. May include criminal and mentally unstable people. Some activists consider them "most radical" because they are "most exploited," but they are un-organizable and more likely to act as paid agents than to have any progressive role in class struggle.}}

In English translations of Marx and Engels, ''lumpenproletariat'' has sometimes been rendered as "social scum", "dangerous classes", "ragamuffin", and "ragged-proletariat".{{sfn|Thoburn|2002|p=440}} It has been described by some scholars and theorists, as well as the Soviet [[nomenclature]], as a declassed ([[:wikt:déclassé#French|déclassé]]) group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kernig|first1=Claus Dieter|authorlink1=:de:Claus Dieter Kernig|title=Marxism, Communism, and Western Society: Class, Class struggle|date=1972|publisher=Herder and Herder|location=New York|page=3|quote=...declassed groups (the Lumpen- proletariat, beggars)...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cheng|first1=Lucie|title=Labor Immigration Under Capitalism: Asian Workers in the United States Before World War II|date=1984|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520048294|page=[https://books.google.am/books?id=XRTYwxpCDmIC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;dq=declassed+lumpen 300]|quote=...population of declassed or lumpen proletariat....}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Abdullah|2006|p=100}}&lt;ref name="Welshman"/&gt;{{sfn|Thoburn|2002|p=435}} The term "[[underclass]]" is considered to be the modern synonym of ''lumpenproleteriat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Paul E.|authorlink1=Paul E. Peterson|title=The Urban Underclass and the Poverty Paradox|journal=[[Political Science Quarterly]]|date=1992|volume=106|issue=4|page=618|doi=10.2307/2151796|jstor=2151796|quote=underclass, like lumpen proletariat, is also a suitable concept for those who, like Karl Marx, want to identify a group shaped and dominated by a society's economic and political forces but who have no productive role.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|"the lumpen proletariat, or what today might be called the 'underclass'."{{sfn|Pulido|2006|p=142}} }} Scholars note its negative connotations.{{efn|"The Marxist term for this underclass, the lumpenproleteriat, conveys distinctly negative images."{{sfn|Brownfield|1986|p=426}} }} Economist Richard McGahey, writing for the ''New York Times'' in 1982, noted that it is one of the older terms in a "long line of labels that stigmatize poor people for their poverty by focusing exclusively on individual characteristics." He listed the following synonyms: "underclass", "undeserving poor", and "[[culture of poverty]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGahey|first=Richard|title=Poverty's Voguish Stigma|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/12/opinion/poverty-s-voguish-stigma.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 March 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another synonym is "[[:wikt:riffraff#English|riff-raff]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carr|first1=Edwar Hallett|authorlink1=E.

In English it may be used in an informal disapproving manner to "describe people who are not clever or well educated, and who are not interested in changing or improving their situation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=lumpen|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/lumpen|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|publisher=[[Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage by Marx and Engels==
According to Bussard [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] viewed the ''lumpenproletariat'' as:{{sfn|Bussard|1987|p=677}}
{{quote frame|essentially parasitical group was largely the remains of older, obsolete stages of social development, and that it could not normally play a progressive role in history. Indeed, because it acted only out of socially ignorant self-interest, the ''lumpenproletariat'' was easily bribed by reactionary forces and could be used to combat the true proletariat in its efforts to bring about the end of bourgeois society. Without a clear class-consciousness, the ''lumpenproletariat'' could not play a positive role in society. Instead, it exploited society for its own ends, and was in turn exploited as a tool of destruction and reaction.}}
They used the term exclusively with negative connotations, although their works lack "consistent and clearly reasoned definition" of the term.{{sfn|Bussard|1987|p=676}} They used the term in various publications "for diverse purposes and on several levels of meaning."{{sfn|Bussard|1987|p=677}}

[[Hal Draper]] suggested that the concept has its roots in [[Young Hegelian]] thought and possibly in [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.W.F. Hegel]]'s ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]''.{{sfn|Bussard|1987|p=676}} While Bussard believes that the idea was "at one and the same time, a hybrid of new social attitudes which crystallised in France, England and Germany, as well as an extension of more traditional, pre-nineteenth-century views of the lower classes."{{sfn|Bussard|1987|p=676}} Bussard noted that they often used the term as a "kind of sociological profanity" and contrasted between it and "working and thinking" [[proletariat]].{{sfn|Bussard|1987|p=683}} According to [[Michael Denning]] by identifying the ''lumpenproletariat'', "Marx was combating the established view that the entire working class was a dangerous and immoral element. He drew a line between the proletariat and the ''lumpenproletariat'' to defend the moral character of the former."{{sfn|Denning|2010|p=87}}

===In early writings===
The first collaborative work by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] to feature the term ''lumpenproletariat'' is ''[[The German Ideology]]'', written in 1845−46.{{sfn|Bussard|1987|p=677}} They used it to describe the [[plebs]] (plebeians) of [[ancient Rome]] who were midway between freemen and [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]], never becoming more than a "proletarian rabble [''lumpenproletariat'']" and [[Max Stirner]]'s "self-professed radical constituency of the Lumpen or ragamuffin."{{sfn|Thoburn|2002|p=440}} The first work written solely by Marx to mention the term was an article published in the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]'' in November 1848 which described the ''lumpenproletariat'' as a "tool of reaction" in the [[revolutions of 1848]] and as a "significant [[counterrevolutionary]] force throughout Europe."{{sfn|Bussard|1987|p=683}} Engels wrote in ''[[The Peasant War in Germany]]'' (1850) that the ''lumpenproletariat'' is a "phenomenon that occurs in a more or less developed form in all the so far known phases of society".&lt;ref name="Khanna"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Friedrich. 1978.

In ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848), where ''lumpenproletariat'' is commonly translated in English editions as the "dangerous class" and the "social scum",{{sfn|Hayes|1988|p=447}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marx|first1=Karl|last2=Engels|first2=Friedrich|author3=Samuel Moore (translator)|title=[[:s:Manifesto of the Communist Party|Manifesto of the Communist Party]]|date=1888|publisher=[[Charles H.

In an article analyzing the [[June Days uprising|June 1848 events in Paris]] Engels wrote of the ''gardes mobiles'', a militia which suppressed the workers' uprising: "The organized ''lumpenproletariat'' had given battle to the working proletariat. It had, as was to be expected, put itself at the disposal of the bourgeoisie."{{sfn|Bussard|1987|p=683}} Thoburn notes that Marx makes his most detailed descriptions of the ''lumpenproletariat'' in his writings of the revolutionary turmoil in France between 1848 and 1852: ''[[The Class Struggles in France 1848-1850]]'' (1850) and ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'' (1852).{{sfn|Thoburn|2002|p=441}} In ''The Class Struggles'' he describes the finance aristocracy of [[Louis Philippe I]] and his [[July Monarchy]] (1830–48) as lumpenproletarian: "In the way it acquires wealth and enjoys it the financial aristocracy is nothing but the lumpenproletariat reborn at the pinnacle of bourgeois society."{{sfn|Thoburn|2002|p=444}}{{sfn|Bussard|1987|p=684}} He distinguished the finance aristocracy from the industrial bourgeoisie as the former became rich "not by production, but by pocketing the already available wealth of others."{{sfn|Hayes|1988|p=449}}  He further suggests that the ''lumpenproletariat'' is a component of the proletariat, unlike his earlier works. He claimed that the ''gardes mobiles'' were set up "to set one segment of the proletariat against the other":{{sfn|Bussard|1987|p=684}}
{{quote frame|They belonged for the most part to the ''lumpenproletariat'', which forms a mass clearly distinguished from the industrial proletariat in all large cities, a recruiting ground for thieves and criminals of all kinds, living on the refuse of society, people without a fixed line of work.}}

In ''The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon'' Marx identified [[Napoleon III]] as the "Chief of the ''Lumpenproletariat''," a claim he made repeatedly. He argued that he bought his supporters with "gifts and loans, these were the limits of the financial science of the ''lumpenproletariat'', both the low and the exalted. Never had a President speculated more stupidly on the stupidity of the masses." For Marx, the ''lumpenproletariat'' represented those who were "corrupt, reactionary and without a clear sense of class-consciousness."{{sfn|Bussard|1987|p=685}} He wrote in ''The Eighteenth Brumaire'':{{sfn|Bussard|1987|pp=685-686}}
{{quote frame|Alongside ruined ''[[:wikt:roué#English|rouès]]'' with questionable means of support and of dubious origin, degenerate and adventurous scions of the bourgeoisie, there were vagabonds, discharged soldiers, discharged convicts, runaway galley slaves, swindlers, charlatans, ''[[Lazzaroni (Naples)|lazzaroni]]'', pickpockets, tricksters, gamblers, procurers, brothel keepers, porters, [[Intellectual|literati]], organ grinders, rag-pickers, knife-grinders, tinkers, beggars; in short, the entirely undefined, disintegrating mass, thrown hither and yon, which the French call ''la bohème''.}}

===''Capital''===
In ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Capital]]'' (1867), Marx focused on the oppressive legislation which turned soldiers and peasants "en masse into beggars, robbers, vagabonds, partly from inclination, in most cases from stress of circumstances." By this, he deviated from his focus on the vicious and degenerate behavior of the ''lumpenproletariat'' in his writings on France. Instead, he described the ''lumpenproletariat'' as part of the what he called an "[[Reserve army of labour|industrial reserve army]]", which capitalists used as times required. Thus, "vagabonds, criminals, prostitutes" and other ''lumpenproletariat'' formed an element within the "surplus population" in a capitalist system.{{sfn|Hayes|1988|p=458}}

==Left-wing views==
===Social Democratic Party of Germany===
The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) was one of the first to use ''lumpenproleteriat'' in their rhetoric, particularly to indicate the scope of their view of a "desirable" working class and exclude the non-respectable poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stewart|first1=Michael|editor1-last=Hann|editor1-first=C.

Historian [[Richard J. Evans]] argued that the SPD, thus, lost touch with the "militancy of the classes which it claimed to represent, a militancy which found expression in frequent outbursts of spontaneous collective protest, both political and industrial, at moments of high social and political tension."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evans|first1=Richard J.|authorlink1=Richard J.

[[Karl Kautsky]] argued in 1890 that it is the ''lumpenproletariat'' and not the "militant industrial proletariat" that mostly suffer from [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fleiter|first1=Andreas|editor1-last=Wetzell|editor1-first=Richard F.|title=Crime and Criminal Justice in Modern Germany|date=2014|publisher=[[Berghahn Books]]|isbn=9781782382478|pages=[https://books.google.am/books?id=oQFPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=social+democratic+germany+lumpenproletariat 67-68]|chapter=Class, Youth, and Sexuality in the Construction of the Lustmorder  Punishment on the Path to Socialism}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[August Bebel]], pre-World War I leader of the SPD, linked [[anti-Semitic]] proletarians to the ''lumpenproletariat'' as the former failed to develop class consciousness, which led to a racial, and not social, explanation of economic inequality.&lt;ref name="Hemmerle"/&gt;

===Bolsheviks and the Soviet Union===
[[Vladimir Lenin]] called socialist attempts to recruit ''lumpenproletariat'' elements "[[opportunism]]".&lt;ref name="Brass"/&gt; In 1925 [[Nikolai Bukharin]] described the ''lumpenproletariat'' as being characterized by "shiftlessness, lack of discipline, hatred of the old, but impotence to construct anything new, an individualistic declassed 'personality' whose actions are based only on foolish caprices."{{sfn|Brownfield|1986|p=426}}&lt;ref name="Welshman"/&gt; In a 1932 article on "How Mussolini Triumphed" [[Leon Trotsky]] described the "declassed and demoralized" ''lumpenproletariat'' as "the countless human beings whom finance capital itself has brought to desperation and frenzy." He argued that capitalism used them through fascism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trotsky|first1=Leon|authorlink1=Leon Trotsky|editor1-last=Banerjee|editor1-first=Aninda|editor2-last=Sarkar|editor2-first=Saurobijay|title=Fascism: What It Is And How To Fight It|date=2005|publisher=Aakar Books|location=Delhi|isbn=81-87879-44-0|page=[https://books.google.am/books?id=wJcu4PdGK2oC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=demoralized+lumpenproletariat 18]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'', written from the [[Marxist-Leninist]] perspective, defined ''lumpenproletariat'' as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lumpen Proletariat|url=https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Lumpen+Proletariat|publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]}} ([https://slovar.cc/enc/bse/2014059.html original Russian text])&lt;/ref&gt;

The bourgeoisie makes use of the lumpen proletariat as [[strikebreaker]]s, as participants in [[fascist]] [[pogrom]] bands, and in other ways. The lumpen proletariat disappears with the abolition of the capitalist system.}}

The term was rarely used in the Soviet Union to describe any portion of the Soviet society because, Hemmerle argues, following the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 "millions of people passed through economic conditions that bore a resemblance to the traditional meaning of ''lumpenproletariat''". However, it was used to label labor movements in capitalist countries which were not pro-Soviet.&lt;ref name="Hemmerle"/&gt; Soviet authorities and scholars instead reserved other terms for their own ''lumpenproletariat'' groups, especially "déclassé elements" (деклассированные элементы, ''deklassirovannye elementy''), and viewed them, like Marx, as "social degenerates, isolated from the forces of production and incapable of having a working-class consciousness." Svetlana Stephenson notes that the Soviet state "for all its ideology of assistance, cooperation and social responsibility, was ready to descent on them with all its might."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stephenson|first=Svetlana|title=Crossing the Line: Vagrancy, Homelessness and Social Displacement in Russia|date=2006|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|isbn=978-0-7546-1813-3|page=[https://books.google.am/books?id=99b9CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=soviet+union+lumpen+proletariat 110]|chapter=Soviet Outcasts: Displacement, Expulsion and Self-expulsion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
[[Mao Zedong]] argued in 1939 that the ''lumpenproletariat'' ({{lang-zh|游民无产者}}, [[pinyin]]: ''yóumín wúchǎnzhě'') in China is a legacy of the country's "colonial and semi-colonial status" which forced a vast number of people in urban and rural areas into illegitimate occupations and activities.{{sfn|Smith|2013|pp=939-940}} Earlier, in 1928, he asserted that "the only way" to win over these wayward proletarians was to carry out intensive thought reform "so as to effect qualitative changes in these elements."{{sfn|Smith|2013|p=940}} He argued that the ''lumpenproletariat'' had a dual nature. Simultaneously, they were "victimized members of the laboring masses and untrustworthy elements with 'parasitic inclinations'", which made them waver between revolution and counterrevolution.{{sfn|Smith|2013|p=940}} He believed that ''lumpenproletariat'' elements, such as [[Triad (organized crime)|triads]], the organized crime syndicates, "can become revolutionary given proper leadership".{{sfn|Cowling|2002|pp=233, 241|ps=: cited in {{cite book|authorlink=Mao Zedong|first=Mao|last=Zedong|chapter=Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society|title=Selected Works: Volume 1|location=Peking|publisher=[[Foreign Languages Press]]|date=1967|p=19}} }} According to [[Luo Ruiqing]], the [[Ministry of Public Security (China)|Minister of Public Security]], the ''lumpenproletariat'' population consisted of prostitutes, vagrant gangs, and theft rings and were political problems that threatened the internal security of China. Following the Communist victory in the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the proclamation of the People's Republic of China (PRC), ''lumpenproletariat'' were interned into government-run reeducation centers. Some 500,000 people were interned into 920 such centers by 1953.{{sfn|Smith|2013|p=945}} Historian Aminda Smith notes that the "case of ''lumpenproletariat'' reformatories suggests that anti-state resistance from members of the oppressed masses was essential to early-PRC rhetoric because it validated claims about the devastating effects of the old society and the transformative power of socialist 'truth'."{{sfn|Smith|2013|pp=950-951}}

===Views on its revolutionary potential ===
Sociologist [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]], who later became a Senator, stated following the [[long hot summer of 1967|riots of 1967]] that the ''lumpenproletariat'' is essentially anarchistic rather than revolutionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hofmann|first1=Paul|authorlink1=Paul Hofmann|title=Moynihan Blames Low Status, Not Race, for Riots|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/10/04/specials/moynihan-riots.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=25 July 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1970s some [[Political radicalism|radical]]s deviated from the orthodox Marxist viewpoint that the ''lumpenproletariat'' lacks significant revolutionary potential.{{sfn|Bussard|1987|p=676}} [[Herbert Marcuse]], an American philosopher and sociologist of the [[Frankfurt School]], believed that the working class in the US "having been bought up by the consumer society, has lost all class consciousness" and lay the hopes for revolution on the ''lumpenproletariat''—the social outcasts—led by intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Winter|first1=Mary|title=Class Consciousness and the British Working Class|journal=[[Marxism Today]]|date=May 1974|volume=18|page=155|publisher=[[Communist Party of Great Britain]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcuse, along with Afro-Caribbean philosopher [[Frantz Fanon]] and other radical intellectuals, proposed that elements of the ''lumpenproletariat'' are potentially leading forces in a revolutionary movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maisano|first1=Chris|title=Letter to the Next Left|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2011/03/letter-to-the-next-left|work=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Michael Denning]] Fanon revived the term, long having been disappeared from left-wing discourse, in this book ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'' (1961).{{sfn|Denning|2010|p=87}} He defined the ''lumpenproletariat'' as the peasantry in colonial societies of the [[Third World]] not involved in industrial production who are unaware of the dominant colonial ideology and are therefore, "ready, capable and willing to revolt against the colonial status quo for liberation." He described them as "one of the most spontaneous and the most radically revolutionary forces of a colonized people."&lt;ref name="Hayes&amp;Kiene"/&gt; He was not uncritical of the ''lumpenproletariat'' due to their supposed unpredictability due to "their ignorance and incomprehension." Colonial forces could make a use of them as hired soldiers.{{sfn|Abdullah|2006|p=104}}

Fanon's use of the term prompted debates and studies, including by [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Charles van Onselen]].{{sfn|Denning|2010|p=88}} The African revolutionary [[Amílcar Cabral]] was skeptical about the ''lumpen'' being used in anti-colonialist liberation revolution.{{sfn|Abdullah|2006|p=100}} His [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] recruited ''déclassé'', but now ''lumpenproletariat'', groups as the latter were supportive of the Portuguese colonial police, while the former, in the absence of a developed proletariat in Guinea and Cape Verde, played a dynamic role in anti-colonialist struggle.{{sfn|Abdullah|2006|p=101}}

====Black Panther Party====
Laura Pulido argues that, historically, the ''lumpenproletariat'' in the US has mostly been African American due to the nation being racially constituted. It is primarily indicated by the high unemployment and incarceration rates among African Americans.{{sfn|Pulido|2006|p=143}} The [[Black Panther Party]], most prominent revolutionary socialists in post-war US, "thought of much of their following as ''lumpenproletarian''."{{sfn|Cowling|2002|p=233}} They adopted Fanon's viewpoint regarding the revolutionary potential of the group.&lt;ref name="Hayes&amp;Kiene"/&gt; Pulido claims the emphasis the Black Panthers put on the ''lumpenproletariat'' was the party's hallmark.{{sfn|Pulido|2006|p=142}} Its co-founders [[Bobby Seale]] and [[Huey P. Newton]] viewed the African-American ''lumpenproletariat'' as a potential organized threat if the party did not mobilize them. Seale included "the brother who's pimping, the brother who's hustling, the unemployed, the downtrodden, the brother who's robbing banks, who's not politically conscious" in his definition of the ''lumpenproletariat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seize the Time|last=Seale|first=Bobby|publisher=Random House|year=1970|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton called them "street brothers", [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienated]] from the system of oppression in the US, and sought to recruit them into the party.&lt;ref name="Hayes&amp;Kiene"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hayes III|first1=Floyd W.|last2=Kiene III|first2=Francis A.|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=Charles E.|title=The Black Panther Party [Reconsidered]|date=1998|publisher=[[Black Classic Press]]|location=Baltimore|isbn=9780933121966|pp=[https://books.google.am/books?id=hxpCxS661Q8C&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=Panthers+took+a+different+position+on+the+lumpen+proletariat 160-161]|chapter="All Power to the People": The Political Thought of Huey P. Newton and The Black Panther Party}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their strategy was a controversial one. Chris Booker and Errol Henderson argued that problems such as "a lack of discipline, a tendency toward violence, the importation of street culture, including crime, and the use of weapons" by Black Panthers was caused by the disproportionately high membership of the ''lumpenproletariat'' in their ranks.{{sfn|Pulido|2006|p=144|ps=: Chris Booker, "Lumpenization: A Critical Error of the Black Panther Party," in Charles Jones, ''Black Panther Party Reconsidered'', Baltimore:

==== Young Lords Party ====
The [[Young Lords|Young Lords Party]] adopted similar views to the Black Panther Party, believing in the potential of the lumpen. They developed a Lumpen Organization within their larger organization with the goal of enlisting the people considered the lumpenproletariat, or "lumpen," in the struggle; they considered the lumpen to be "the class in our nation which for years and years have not been able to find jobs, and are forced to be drug addicts, prostitutes, etc." (p.&amp;nbsp;20) in the face of the capitalist system the Party considered an enemy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Enck-Wanzer, Darrel. ''The Young Lords a Reader''. New York: New York UP, 2010. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Crucial to the party's view on the lumpen is that, unlike criticisms of the lumpenproletariat around a perceived lack of productivity and organization, the Young Lords Party stated that "it's a law of revolution that the most oppressed group takes the leadership position" (p.&amp;nbsp;42) and that the lumpen would be the immediate focus of the party's organizing efforts in liberating all oppressed peoples.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Criticism===
[[Ernesto Laclau]] argued that Marx's dismissal of the ''lumpenproletariat'' showed the limitations of his theory of [[economic determinism]] and argued that the group and "its possible integration into the politics of populism as an 'absolute outside' that threatens the coherence of ideological identifications."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McMillan|first1=Chris|title=Žižek and Communist Strategy: On the Disavowed Foundations of Global Capitalism: On the Disavowed Foundations of Global Capitalism|date=2012|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|isbn=9780748646654|page=[https://books.google.am/books?id=GZtvAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=populism+as+an+%27absolute+outside 127]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Cowling argues that the "concept is being used for its political impact rather than because it provides good explanations" and that its political impact is "pernicious" and an "obstacle to clear analysis."{{sfn|Cowling|2002|pp=237-238}} Laura Pulido argues that there is a diversity in the ''lumpen'' population, especially in terms of consciousness.{{sfn|Pulido|2006|p=143}}

====Anarchist criticism====
Post-anarchist [[Saul Newman]] wrote in 2010 that classical anarchists argue that the ''lumpenproletariat'' should be designated as a revolutionary class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=Saul|authorlink1=Saul Newman|title=The Politics of Postanarchism|date=2010|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|isbn=9780748654161|page=[https://books.google.am/books?id=xY9vAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=consciousness+Lumpenproletariat 117]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Tom Brass]], individualist anarchist [[Max Stirner]] "celebrated the lumpenproletariat as authentic rebels."&lt;ref name="Brass"/&gt; Anarchist thinker [[Mikhail Bakunin]], who was dubbed "the lumpen prince" by Engels, wrote that only in the ''lumpenproletariat'' and "and not in the bourgeois strata of workers, are there crystallised the entire intelligence and power of the coming [[Social Revolution]]."{{sfn|Thoburn|2002|p=445}} Thoburn writes that for him, the ''lumpenproletariat'' represented a "kind of actually existing anarchism."{{sfn|Thoburn|2002|p=446}} Ann Robertson notes that Bakunin believed that "inherent in humanity is a natural essence which can be suppressed but never entirely extinguished. Those in society who are more distant from the State apparatus (the peasants are scattered throughout the countryside, the ''lumpenproletariat'' simply refuses to obey the laws) are accordingly natural leaders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robertson|first1=Ann|title=Marxism and Anarchism: The Philosophical Roots of the Marx-Bakunin Conflict|url=http://workerscompass.org/pubs/marxism_anarchism_roberston.pdf|website=workerscompass.org|publisher=A Workers Action Pamphlet|page=20|format=[http://workerscompass.org/marxism-and-anarchism-the-philosophical-roots-of-the-marx-bakunin-conflict/ web version]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakunin stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Dolgoff|editor1-first=Sam|editor1-link=Sam Dolgoff|title=Bakunin on Anarchy|date=1972|publisher=[[Vintage Books]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0394717838|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In American political discourse===
The 1979 report of the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|Carnegie Council on Policy Studies in Higher Education]] warned that the US is in danger of creating "a permanent underclass, a self‐perpetuating culture of poverty, a substantial 'lumpen proletariat'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maeroff|first1=Gene I.|title=Panel Proposes Broad Changes in Education and Job Preparation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/28/archives/panel-proposes-broad-changes-in-education-and-job-preparation.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=28 November 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]] wrote in 1985: "An American version of a lumpenproletariat (the so-called underclass), without work and without hope, existing at the margins of society, could bring down the great cities, sap resources and strength from the entire society and, lacking the usual means to survive, prey upon those who possess them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Norton|first1=Eleanor Holmes|authorlink1=Eleanor Holmes Norton|title=Restoring the Traditional Black Family|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/02/magazine/restoring-the-traditional-black-family.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2 June 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to political scientist [[Marie Gottschalk]] the tough-on-crime stance on African Americans has been caused by political manipulation of public fears of a lumpen underclass threatening the majority as African Americans were perceived to have turned to crime due to losing in the [[deindustrialization]] of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gottschalk|first1=Marie|authorlink1=Marie Gottschalk|title=It's Not Just the Drug War|journal=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]|date=March 2015|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/03/mass-incarceration-war-on-drugs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Society, the authors predict, will have little use for this underclass in a world dominated by sophisticated machines and the bright human beings who tend them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Browne|first=Malcolm|authorlink=Malcolm Browne|title=What Is Intelligence, and Who Has It?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/16/books/what-is-intelligence-and-who-has-it.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=16 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage in India===
[[Ranjit Kumar Gupta|Ranjit Gupta]], the Inspector General of the [[West Bengal Police]], claimed in 1973 that the Maoist [[Naxalite]] rebels in India were made of "some intellectuals and lumpen proletariat.

===Islamism===
Sociologist [[Saad Eddin Ibrahim]] argued that the urban ''lumpenproletariat'' in the Arab Middle East has "proven particularly open" to the appeal of [[Islamism|political Islam]]: "In fact, the Islamists' populist appeal positively resonates among it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ibrahim|first1=Saad Eddin|authorlink1=Saad Eddin Ibrahim|title=Crises, Elites, and Democratization in the Arab World|journal=[[The Middle East Journal]]|date=1993|volume=47|issue=2|pages=293–294|doi=|jstor=4328573}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Power notes that many observers familiar with the [[Madrassas in Pakistan|madrasas in Pakistan]], such as [[Darul Uloom Haqqania|Haqqania]], "have seen firsthand the preaching and indoctrination of hatred by clerics, creating a class of religious ''lumpen proletariat''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Power|first1=Jonathan|title=There's good in Pakistan's madrasas|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/07/opinion/theres-good-in-pakistans-madrasas.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=7 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
[[:it:Ernesto Ragionieri|Ernesto Ragionieri]], an Italian Marxist historian, argued to have confirmed in his 1953 book ''Un comune socialista'' that the ''lumpenproletariat'' is essentially a conservative force based on his study of [[Sesto Fiorentino]]. He found that some 450-500 members of the working class had joined the liberal-conservative party, which was led by landowners, industrialists, and professionals in hopes of getting recommendation that would allow them to join [[Doccia porcelain|Richard-Ginori]], the largest local employer, which refused to hire socialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kohn|first1=Margaret|title=Radical Space: Building the House of the People|date=2003|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|isbn=9780801488603|page=[https://books.google.am/books?id=6a_Airc1VFkC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=ragionieri+commune 194]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence===
In 1966 sociologist [[David Matza]] cited disorder and violence as two of the most prominent characteristics of the disreputable poor.{{sfn|Brownfield|1986|p=426}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matza|first1=David|authorlink1=David Matza|editor1-last=Bendix|editor1-first=Reinhard|editor2-last=Lipset|editor2-first=Seymour M.|editor1-link=Reinhard Bendix|editor2-link=Seymour Martin Lipset|title=Class, Status and Power|date=1966|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|chapter=The Disreputable Poor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1977 book ''Class, State, and Crime'', Marxist historian [[Richard Quinney]] defined ''lumpen'' crimes (or "predatory crimes") as those intended for purely personal profit.&lt;ref&gt;cited in {{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Brent L.|title=Terrorism in America: Pipe Bombs and Pipe Dreams|date=1994|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791417591|page=[https://books.google.am/books?id=boadd2Ecug8C&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=consciousness+Lumpenproletariat 153]}}; original source: {{cite book|last1=Quinney|first1=Richard|authorlink1=Richard Quinney|title=Class, State, and Crime: On Theory and Practice of Criminal Justice|date=1977|publisher=D. McKay Co.|location=New York|pages=55–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1986 study sociologist David Brownfield defined the ''lumpen-proletariat'' (or the "disreputable poor") by their unemployment and receipt of welfare benefits.{{sfn|Brownfield|1986|p=421}} He concluded that "while no significant effects of class can be found using a neo-Marxist conception of class, gradational measures of class (occupation and education) [...] Measures of disreputable poverty—unemployment and welfare status [recipiency]—are relatively strong correlates of violent behavior."{{sfn|Brownfield|1986|p=435}} He explained:{{sfn|Brownfield|1986|p=429}}
{{quote frame|The frustrations and the anger associated with unemployment and being on welfare are compounded by the lack of such fundamental necessities as food, clothing, and shelter among some of the disreputable poor. It would seem self-evident that such an environment of absolute deprivation may be the breeding grounds for discontent and violence.}}

==Imitations==
Several terms have been coined in imitation of ''lumpenproletariat'' such as:
*''lumpenintelligentsia'', to depreciatively describe in Britain, "a section of the [[intelligentsia]] regarded as making no useful contribution to society, or as lacking taste, culture, etc. Also more generally: the intelligentsia collectively, regarded as worthless or powerless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=lumpenintelligentsia|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/lumpenintelligentsia|website=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''lumpen militariat'', coined by [[Ali Mazrui]] in 1973, to describe the newly emerging "class of semi-organized, rugged, and semi-literate soldiery which has begun to claim a share of power and influence in what would otherwise have become a heavily privileged meritocracy of the educated" in post-colonial Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mazrui|first=Ali A.|authorlink=Ali Mazrui|title=The Lumpen Proletariat and the Lumpen Militariat: African Soldiers as a New Political Class|journal=[[Political Studies (journal)|Political Studies]]|date=1973|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–12|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.1973.tb01413.x|publisher=[[Political Studies Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Trumpen Proletariat'', coined by [[Jonah Goldberg]] in 2015, to describe [[Donald Trump]]'s "biggest fans", who he believed "are not to be relied upon in the conservative cause" in the same way the ''lumpen proletariat'' was not to be relied upon for a socialist revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldberg|first1=Jonah|authorlink1=Jonah Goldberg|title=Donald Trump's Popularity -- It's Corrupting Conservatism|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/423607/donald-trump-conservative-movement-jonah-goldberg|work=[[National Review]]|date=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Henninger]] used the term as well in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henninger|first1=Daniel|authorlink1=Daniel Henninger|title=The Trumpen Proletariat|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-trumpen-proletariat-1467847631|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Milkdrop Screenshot Mandala Chasers.jpg|thumb|right|Screenshot of preset included in [[MilkDrop]], a PC based music visualization software (version 1.04d, 2001)]]
'''Music visualization''' or '''music visualisation''', a feature found in electronic music visualizers and [[media player (application software)|media player]] [[software]], generates animated [[Computer-generated imagery|imagery]] based on a piece of music.  The imagery is usually generated and rendered in real time and in a way synchronized with the music as it is played.

Visualization techniques range from simple ones (e.g., a simulation of an [[oscilloscope]] display) to elaborate ones, which often include a plurality of [[Compositing|composited]] effects.  The changes in the music's [[loudness]] and [[frequency spectrum]] are among the properties used as input to the visualization.

Effective music visualization aims to attain a high degree of visual [[correlation]] between a musical track's spectral characteristics such as frequency and [[amplitude]] and the objects or components of the visual image being rendered and displayed.

==Definition==
''"Music visualization"'' can be defined, in contrast to previous existing pre-generated music plus visualization combinations (as for example [[music videos]]), by its characteristic as being [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]] generated. Another possible distinction is seen by some in the ability of some music visualization systems (such as Geiss' [[MilkDrop]]) to create different visualizations for each song or audio every time the program is run, in contrast to other forms of music visualization (such as [[music videos]] or a [[laser lighting display]]) which always show the same visualization. Music visualization may be achieved in a 2D or a 3D [[coordinate system]] where up to 6 dimensions can be modified, the 4th, 5th and 6th dimensions being color, intensity and transparency./

==History==
[[File:Atarivideomusic.png|300px|thumb|right|The [[Atari Video Music]], available in 1976. The unit never gained enough popularity and was in production for only a year.]]
The first electronic music visualizer was the [[Atari Video Music]] introduced by [[Atari, Inc|Atari Inc.]] in 1976, and designed by the initiator of the home version of ''[[Pong]]'', Robert Brown. The idea was to create a visual exploration that could be implemented into a [[Hi-Fi]] stereo system. It is described in {{Cite patent|US|4081829}}. In [[Great Britain]] music visualization was first pioneered by [[Fred Judd]].

Music and audio players were available on early home computers, ''Sound to Light Generator'' (1985, Infinite Software) used the ZX Spectrum's cassette player for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0018300|title=Sound to Light Generator|work=World of Spectrum |accessdate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1984 movie [[Electric Dreams (film)|Electric Dreams]] prominently made use of one, although as a pre-generated effect, rather than calculated in [[Live streaming|real-time]].

For [[IBM PC|PC]]/[[MS-DOS|DOS]] one of the first modern music visualization programs was the [[open-source]], multi-platform ''[[Cthugha (software)|Cthugha]]'' in 1993. In the 1990s the emerging [[demoscene|demo]] and [[Tracker (music software)|tracker music]] scene pioneered the real-time technics for music visualization on the PC platform; resulting examples are ''Cubic player'' (1994), ''Inertia Player'' (1995) or in general their real-time generated [[Demo coding|Demo]]s.&lt;ref name="hartmann"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Hartmann |first=Doreen |title=Computer Demos and the Demoscene: Artistic Subcultural Innovation in Real-Time. |conference=16th International Symposium of Electronic Art |year=2010 |url=http://www.isea2010ruhr.org/files/redaktion/pdf/isea2010_proceedings_p11_hartmann.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CESCG-2002&gt;{{cite web|author1=Boris Burger |author2=Ondrej Paulovic |author3=Milos Hasan |url=http://www.cescg.org/CESCG-2002/BBurger |work=CESCG-2002 |title=Realtime Visualization Methods in the Demoscene |publisher=[[Technische Universität Wien]] |date=2002-03-21 |accessdate=2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, PC computer music visualization became widespread in the mid to late 1990s as applications such as ''[[Winamp]]'' (1997), ''[[Audion (software)|Audion]]'' (1999), and ''[[SoundJam]]'' (2000). By 1999, there were several dozen [[freeware]] non-trivial music visualizers in distribution. In particular, ''[[MilkDrop]]'' (2001) and its predecessor "geiss-plugin" (1998) by [[Ryan Geiss]], ''G-Force'' by [[Andy O'Meara]], and [[Advanced Visualization Studio|AVS]] (2000) by [[Nullsoft]] became popular music visualizations. AVS is part of [[Winamp]] and has been recently [[open-source]]d,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/projects/avs/ AVS] on [[sourceforge]].com&lt;/ref&gt; and G-Force was licensed for use in [[iTunes]]&lt;ref&gt;"About iTunes" - iTunes 8.0.0.35 credits&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Windows Media Center]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} and is presently the flagship product for Andy O'Meara's software startup company, SoundSpectrum. 

Some of the more recent applications such as Luminant Music (2017), produce visualization in real time and render to a full-3D environment. 

With the increasing popularity of [[virtual reality]], several start ups have begun working on music visualization although reception has been mixed &lt;ref name="theverge.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/28/10675270/gear-vr-virtual-reality-music-visualizer-groovr|title=Does anybody really want a virtual reality music visualizer?|date=28 December 2015|website=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt; with one informal poll finding that only 33% of respondents were interested in music visualization for VR.&lt;ref name="theverge.com"/&gt;

{{SikhBeliefs}}
In [[Sikhism]], '''''Nām Japō''''' ([[Gurmukhi]] ਨਾਮ ਜਪੋ), ''Naam Japna'', or ''Naam Simran'' refers to the [[meditation]], vocal singing of [[hymn]]s from the Sri [[Guru Granth Sahib]] or contemplating the various [[Names of God#Sikhism|Names of God]] (or qualities of God), especially the chanting of the word ''[[Waheguru]]'', which means "Wonderful Lord" representing the formless being, the creator of all the forms and the being omnipresent in all forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mosher|first=Lucinda|title=Faith in the neighborhood: Praying: The Rituals of Faith|year=2005|publisher=Church Publishing, Inc.|isbn=9781596271555}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singing of hymns generally is also referred to as ''Nām Jap'', sometimes also called ''Nām [[Simran (Sanskrit word)|Simran]]''. Singing of hymns with musical accompaniment is generally referred to as ''[[Kirtan]]''. While contemplating God's names a devotee is able to get [[Nām Japō|nām]], the divine connection with God. Nām is able to fulfill all desires and cleanse the mind of its impurities distress. Through Nām the devotees are able to harness Godly qualities and remove [[Five Thieves|the five thieves]].

''Nām Japna'' requires the remembrance of God or the [[Akal|Akal Purkh]], the supreme formless power that is timeless and deathless,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Abstracts of Sikh Studies, Volume 6|year=2004|publisher=Institute of Sikh Studies|location=the University of Michigan|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; by repeating and focusing the mind on God's various names or qualities. Some of the names of Gods can be found in the [[Mul Mantar]], which is repeated throughout the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], and also found in [[Guru Gobind Singh]]'s [[Jaap Sahib]], which contains 950 names of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Prithi Pal|title=The History of Sikh Gurus|year=2006|publisher=Lotus Press|isbn=9788183820752|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guideline in the ''[[Sikh Rehat Maryada|Rehat Maryada]]'' of [[Guru Gobind Singh]] demands that the [[Sikh]] engage in ''Naam Simran'' as part of his or her daily routine.

''Nām Japō'' is one of the [[Three pillars of Sikhism]], along with ''[[Kirat karō]]'' and ''[[Vaṇḍ chakkō]]''. Critical importance is given to the meditation in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] as the way in which humans can conquer ego, greed, attachment, anger and lust, together commonly called the [[Five Evils]] or Five Thieves and to bring peace and tranquility into one's mind. The Sikhs practice both the quiet individual recitation of ''Naam'' in one's mind, commonly called ''Naam Simran'', and the loud and communal recitation of ''Naam'', called ''Naam Jaap''. However, this is not a strict definition of these phrases.

Guru Ji says in the Guru Granth Sahib:
{{Quote|With my hands I do God's work; with my tongue I sing God's Glorious Praises.&lt;br&gt;
With my feet, I walk on the Path of my Lord and Master. ((1)) &lt;br&gt;
It is a good time, when I remember Him in meditation. &lt;br&gt;
Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, I cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ((1)(Pause)) &lt;br&gt;
With your eyes, behold the Blessed Vision of the Saints. &lt;br&gt;
Record the Immortal Lord God within your mind. ((2)) &lt;br&gt;
Listen to the Kirtan of God's Praises, at the Feet of the Holy. &lt;br&gt;
Your fears of birth and death shall depart. ((3))&lt;br&gt;
Enshrine the Lotus Feet of your Lord and Master within your heart. &lt;br&gt;
Thus this human life, so difficult to obtain, shall be redeemed. ((4)(51)(120))|Guru Granth Sahib, page 189&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=189&amp;english=t&amp;id=8044 Srigranth.org (text in red)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <comment>/* Adults */ Correct typos "willing" -&gt; "winning"; "in 10,000 chance" -&gt; "a one in 10,000 chance"</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12800">The '''neglect of probability''', a type of [[cognitive bias]], is the tendency to disregard [[probability]] when making a decision under uncertainty and is one simple way in which people regularly violate the normative rules for decision making. Small risks are typically either neglected entirely or hugely overrated. The continuum between the extremes is ignored. The term '''probability neglect''' was coined by [[Cass Sunstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Kahneman, D. (2011). [http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780141918921,00.html Thinking Fast and Slow], Allen Lane 2011, p. 143 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many related ways in which people violate the normative rules of decision making with regard to probability including the [[hindsight bias]], the [[neglect of prior base rates effect]], and the [[gambler's fallacy]]. However, this bias is different in that rather than incorrectly using probability, the actor disregards it.

"We have no intuitive grasp of risk and thus distinguish poorly among different threats," Dobelli has written. "The more serious the threat and the more emotional the topic (such as radioactivity), the less reassuring a reduction in risk seems to us."&lt;ref name="Meaning Ring"/&gt;

==Studies==
===Adults===
In a 1972 experiment, participants were divided into two groups, with the former being told they would receive a mild electric shock and the latter told that there was a 50 percent chance they would receive such a shock. When the subjects' physical anxiety was measured, there was no difference between the two groups. This lack of difference remained even when the second group's chance of being shocked was lowered to 20 percent, then ten, then five. The conclusion: "we respond to the expected magnitude of an event...but not to its likelihood. In other words: We lack an intuitive grasp of probability."&lt;ref name="Meaning Ring"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why You’ll Soon Be Playing Mega Trillions|url=http://meaningring.com/2016/03/28/neglect-of-probability-by-rolf-dobelli/|website=Meaning Ring|publisher=Meaning Ring|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron (2000) suggests that the bias manifests itself among adults especially when it comes to difficult choices, such as medical decisions. This bias could make actors drastically violate expected-utility theory in their decision making, especially when a decision must be made in which one possible outcome has a much lower or higher utility but a small probability of occurring (e.g. in medical or gambling situations). In this aspect, the neglect of probability bias is similar to the [[neglect of prior base rates effect]].

Cass Sunstein has cited the history of [[Love Canal]] in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]], which became world-famous in the late 1970s owing to widely publicized public concerns about abandoned waste that was supposedly causing medical problems in the area. In response to these concerns, the U.S. federal government set in motion "an aggressive program for cleaning up abandoned hazardous waste sites, without examining the probability that illness would actually occur," and legislation was passed that did not reflect serious study of the actual degree of danger. Furthermore, when controlled studies were publicized showing little evidence that the waste represented a menace to public health, the anxiety of local residents did not diminish.&lt;ref name="Sunstein"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sunstein|first1=Cass|title=Probability Neglect: Emotions, Worst Cases, and Law|date=November 2001|ssrn=292149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One [[University of Chicago]] study showed that people are as afraid of a 1% chance as of a 99% chance of contamination by poisonous chemicals.&lt;ref name="Meaning Ring"/&gt; In another example of near-total neglect of probability, Rottenstreich and Hsee (2001) found that the typical subject was willing to pay $10 to avoid a 99% chance of a painful electric shock, and $7 to avoid a 1% chance of the same shock. They suggest that probability is more likely to be neglected when the outcomes are emotion-arousing.

David Minger cites the [[anti-vaccination movement]] as an example of the neglect of probability. On the one hand, the odds of a child experiencing a severe allergic reaction to the [[MMR vaccine]], which prevents [[mumps]], [[measles]], and [[rubella]], are about 1 in a million; on the other hand, one in four measles patients will require hospitalization, one in a thousand will develop [[encephalitis]], and one or two out of a thousand will die. Nonetheless, many parents reject the vaccine.&lt;ref name="Minger"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Minger|first1=David|title=Why is neglect of probability a cognitive bias?|url=https://www.quora.com/Why-is-neglect-of-probability-a-cognitive-bias|website=Quora|publisher=Quora|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Tom Cagley noted that neglect of probability is "common in [[IT]] organizations that are planning and estimating projects or in risk management." He pointed out that there are available techniques, such as the [[Monte Carlo analysis]], to study probability, but too often "the continuum of probability is ignored."&lt;ref name="Cagley"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cagley|first1=Tom|title=Cognitive Bias|url=https://tcagley.wordpress.com/2013/07/08/cognitive-bias-daily-process-thoughts-july-8-2013/|website=TCagley|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Rolf Dobelli]] presented a choice between two [[games of chance]]. In one, you have a one in 100 million chance of winning $10 million; in the other, you have a one in 10,000 chance of winning $10,000. It is more reasonable to choose the second game; but most people would choose the first. For this reason, jackpots in lotteries are growing.&lt;ref name="Meaning Ring"/&gt;

Dobelli has described the U.S. Food Act of 1958 as a "classic example" of neglect of probability. The law – which prohibited [[carcinogenic]] substances in food, no matter how low the probability that they would in fact result in [[cancer]] – led to the substitution of those substances by ingredients that, while not causing cancer, stood a far greater chance of causing some sort of medical harm.&lt;ref name="Meaning Ring"/&gt;

In 2001, there was widespread panic around the U.S. over [[shark attacks]], even though there was no evidence to show any increase in their occurrence. Legislation was actually enacted to address the issue.&lt;ref name="Sunstein"/&gt; Neglect of probability also figures in the purchase of [[lottery ticket]]s.&lt;ref name="Cagley"/&gt; Cass Sunstein has pointed out that terrorism is effective partly because of probability neglect.&lt;ref name="Sunstein"/&gt; "Terrorists show a working knowledge of probability neglect," he wrote in 2003, "producing public fear that might greatly exceed the discounted harm."&lt;ref name="Journal of Risk and Uncertainty"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sunstein|first1=Cass|title=Terrorism and Probability Neglect|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|date=March 2003|volume=26|issue=2|pages=121–136|doi=10.1023/A:1024111006336|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
The probability bias is especially pronounced among children. In a 1993 study, Baron, Granato, Spranca, and Teubal presented children with the following situation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Susan and Jennifer are arguing about whether they should wear seat belts when they ride in a car. Susan says that you should. Jennifer says you shouldn't... Jennifer says that she heard of an accident where a car fell into a lake and a woman was kept from getting out in time because of wearing her seat belt, and another accident where a seat belt kept someone from getting out of the car in time when there was a fire. What do you think about this?''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Jonathan Baron]] (2000) notes that subject X responded in the following manner:
:A: Well, in that case I don't think you should wear a seat belt.
:Q (interviewer): How do you know when that's gonna happen?
:A: Like, just hope it doesn't!
:Q: So, should you or shouldn't you wear seat belts?
:A: Well, tell-you-the-truth we should wear seat belts.
:Q: How come?
:A: Just in case of an accident. You won't get hurt as much as you will if you didn't wear a seat belt.
:Q: OK, well what about these kinds of things, when people get trapped?
:A: I don't think you should, in that case.

It is clear that subject X completely disregards the probability of an accident happening versus the probability of getting hurt by the seat belt in making the decision. A normative model for this decision would advise the use of [[Expected utility hypothesis|expected-utility]] theory to decide which option would likely maximize utility. This would involve weighing the changes in utility in each option by the probability that each option will occur, something that subject X ignores.

Another subject responded to the same question:
:A: If you have a long trip, you wear seat belts half way.
:Q: Which is more likely?
:A: That you'll go flyin' through the windshield.
:Q: Doesn't that mean you should wear them all the time?
:A: No, it doesn't mean that.
:Q: How do you know if you're gonna have one kind of accident or the other?
:A: You don't know. You just hope and pray that you don't.

Again, the subject disregards the probability in making the decision by treating each possible outcome as equal in his reasoning.

==Practical consequences==
David Minger has called neglect of probability "a problematic bias because it skews reality and throws rational judgment off."&lt;ref name="Minger"/&gt; It results in poor decision making: "We invest in start-ups because the potential profit makes dollar signs flash before our eyes, but we forget (or are too lazy) to investigate the slim chances of new businesses actually achieving such growth. Similarly, following extensive media coverage of a plane crash, we cancel flights without really considering the minuscule probability of crashing (which, of course, remains the same before and after such a disaster)."&lt;ref name="Meaning Ring"/&gt; Cass Sunstein has noted that for a long time after [[9/11]], many people refused to fly because they felt a heightened sense of fear or peril, even though, statistically, most of them "were not at significantly more risk after the attacks than they were before." Indeed, those who chose to drive long distances instead of flying thereby put themselves at an increased risk, given that driving is the less safe form of transportation.&lt;ref name="Sunstein"/&gt;

==Legal ramifications==
In a 2001 paper, Sunstein addressed the question of how the law should respond to the neglect of probability. He emphasized that it is important for government to "create institutions designed to ensure that genuine risks, rather than tiny ones, receive the most concern". While government policies in regard to potential dangers should focus on statistics and probabilities, government efforts to raise public awareness of these dangers should emphasize worst-case scenarios in order to be maximally effective. Moreover, while it seems advisable for government to "attempt to educate and inform people, rather than capitulating to unwarranted public fear", that fear will remain a real phenomenon and may thus cause serious problems, for example leading citizens to undertake "wasteful and excessive private precautions". In such cases, certain  kinds of government regulation may be justified not because they address serious dangers but because they reduce fear. At the same time, government should "treat its citizens with respect" and "not treat them as objects to be channeled in government's preferred directions", so focusing on worst-case scenarios that feed on irrational fears would amount to "unacceptable manipulation".&lt;ref name="Sunstein"/&gt; In a 2003 article, however, Sunstein concluded that "As a normative matter, government should reduce even unjustified fear, if the benefits of the response can be shown to outweigh the costs."&lt;ref name="Journal of Risk and Uncertainty"/&gt;

The '''Nine Charges''' are a different list of more explicitly phrased moral or ethical guidelines codified at about the same time.&lt;ref&gt;"one of the original lists, published by the Odinist Committee [old Odinic Rite], founded in 1972, was referred to as the 'Nine Charges'" Snook, Jennifer; American Heathens: The Politics of Identity in a Pagan Religious Movement, Temple University Press, 2015. P. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linzie, Bil; [http://heathengods.com/library/bil_linzie/ Germanic Mythology], July 2003, P. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;
The '''Six-Fold Goal''' is yet another list of virtues, given as "Right, Wisdom, Might, Harvest, Frith and Love" by [[Stephen Flowers|Stephen Flowers (a.k.a. Edred Thorsson)]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Edred Thorsson, ''A Book of Troth'' (1989){{page needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aesirian Code of Nine''' is also used by some practitioners of Heathenism, consisting of "honor, knowledge, protect, flourish, change, fairness, conflict, balance and control."

==Nine Noble Virtues==
The list of "Nine Noble Virtues" is due to either John Yeowell (a.k.a. Stubba)&lt;ref&gt;"Rocking For Satan", Searchlight Magazine, November 1997.
Obituary,  published in "Comrade" - The News Letter of the Friends of Oswald Mosley {{huh|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and John Gibbs-Bailey (a.k.a. Hoskuld), members of [[Odinic Rite]], or alternatively due to [[Edred Thorsson]], at the time member of the ''Asatru Free Assembly''.&lt;ref&gt;Snook, Jennifer; American Heathens: The Politics of Identity in a Pagan Religious Movement, Temple University Press, 2015. P. 70-72.
Linzie, Bil; [http://heathengods.com/library/bil_linzie/ Germanic Mythology], July 2003, P. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Stephen A. McNallen]] compiled a similar list under the title "Some Odinist Values" in the [[Asatru Folk Assembly]] journal ''The Runestone'' (re-published in anthology form in 1983).&lt;ref name="McNallen1983"&gt;McNallen, Stephen A.; An Odinist Anthology: Selections From The Runestone, p. 13, AFA, 1983.[http://solargeneral.org/wp-content/uploads/library/odinist-anthology-selections-from-the-runestone.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__

== Background: ''C. elegans'' ==
The roundworm ''C. elegans'' has one of the simplest nervous systems of any organism, with its [[hermaphrodite]] type having only 302 neurons. Furthermore, the structural [[connectome]] of these neurons is fully worked out. There are fewer than one thousand cells in the whole body of a ''C. elegans'' worm, and because ''C. Elegans'' is a [[model organism]], each has a unique identifier and comprehensive supporting literature. Being a model organism, the genome is fully known, along with many well characterized mutants readily available, a comprehensive literature of behavioural studies, etc. With so few neurons and new calcium 2 photon microscopy techniques it should soon be possible to record the complete neural activity of a living organism. By manipulating the neurons through optogenetic techniques, combined with the above recording capacities the project is in an unprecedented position to be able to fully characterize the neural dynamics of an entire organism.

In the process of trying to build an "in silico" model of a relatively simple organism like ''C. elegans'', new tools are being developed which will make it easier to model progressively more complex organisms.

===NemaLoad===

Project Nemaload &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121007022842/http://nemaload.davidad.org/ NemaLoad]&lt;/ref&gt; was created as a research program trying to empirically establish the relevant biological facts which are necessary for a true bottom-up simulation. The project founder, [[David Dalrymple (computer scientist)|David Dalrymple]], is a collaborator on the OpenWorm project.

==OpenWorm project==

Although the ultimate goal is to simulate all features of ''C. elegans''' behaviour, the project is new and the first behaviour the Open Worm community decided to simulate is a simple motor response: teaching the worm to crawl. To do so, the virtual worm must be placed in a virtual environment. A full feedback loop must be established: Environmental Stimulus &gt; Sensory Transduction &gt; Interneuron Firing &gt; Motor Neuron Firing &gt; Motor Output &gt; Environmental Change &gt; Sensory Transduction.

There are two main technical challenges here: modelling the neural/electrical properties of the brain as it processes the information, and modelling the mechanical properties of the body as it moves. The neural properties are being modeled by a [[Hodgkin-Huxley model]], and the mechanical properties are being modeled by a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic algorithm.

The OpenWorm team built an engine called Geppetto which could integrate these algorithms and due to its modularity will be able to model other biological systems (like [[digestion]]) which the team will tackle at a later time.

The team also built an environment called NeuroConstruct which is able to output neural structures in [[NeuroML]]. Using NeuroConstruct the team reconstructed the full connectome of ''C. elegans''.

Using NeuroML the team has also built a model of a muscle cell. Note that these models currently only model the relevant properties for the simple motor response: the neural/electrical and the mechanical properties discussed above.

The next step is to connect this muscle cell to the six neurons which synapse on it and approximate their effect.

The rough plan is to then both:
* Approximate the synapses which synapse on those neurons
* Repeat the process for other muscle cells

===Progress===
As of January 2015, the project is still awaiting peer review, and researchers involved in the project are reluctant to make bold claims about its current resemblance to biological behavior; project coordinator Stephen Larson estimates that they are "only 20 to 30 percent of the way towards where we need to get".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/21/tech/mci-lego-worm/ |title=Scientists upload a worm's mind into a Lego robot |work=CNN |last=Shadbolt |first=Peter |date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Japanese researchers announced the Perfect C. elegans Project. A proposal was submitted, but the project appears to have been abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kitano|first=Hiroaki|last2=Hamahashi|first2=Shugo|last3=Luke|first3=Sean|date=April 1998|title=The Perfect C.

In 2004 a group from Hiroshima began the Virtual C. elegans Project. They released two papers which showed how their simulation would retract from virtual prodding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_152.pdf |title=A dynamic body model of the Nematode C. elegans with neural oscillators |journal=Journal of Robotics and Mechatronics |volume=17 |issue=3 |date=2005 |first1=Michiyo |last1=Suzuki |first2=Takeshi |last2=Goto |first3=Toshio |last3=Tsuji |first4=Hisao |last4=Ohtake |pages=318–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suzuki|first=Michiyo|last2=Tsuji|first2=Toshio|last3=Ohtake|first3=Hisao|date=September 2005|title=A model of motor control of the nematode C. elegans with neuronal circuits|url=http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_153.pdf|journal=Artificial Intelligence in Medicine|volume=35|issue=1-2|pages=75–86|doi=10.1016/j.artmed.2005.01.008|issn=0933-3657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 a Texas researcher described a simplified C. elegans simulator based on a 1-wire network incorporating a digital Parallax Basic Stamp processor, sensory inputs and motor outputs. Inputs employed 16-bit A/D converters attached to operational amplifier simulated neurons and a 1-wire temperature sensor. Motor outputs were controlled by 256-position digital potentiometers and 8-bit digital ports. Artificial muscle action was based on Nitinol actuators. It used a "sense-process-react" operating loop which recreated several instinctual behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Paul |last=Frenger |title=Simple C. elegans Nervous System Emulator |conference=Houston Conference for Biomedical Engineering Research |date=2005 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These early attempts of simulation have been criticized for not being biologically realistic. Although we have the complete structural connectome, we do not know the [[synaptic weight]]s at each of the known synapses. We do not even know whether the synapses are inhibitory or excitatory. To compensate for this the Hiroshima group used machine learning to find some weights of the synapses which would generate the desired behaviour. It is therefore no surprise that the model displayed the behaviour, and it may not represent true understanding of the system.

==Open science==
The Open Worm community is committed to the ideals of [[open science]]. Generally this means that the team will try to publish in open access journals and include all data gathered (to avoid the file drawer problem). Indeed, all the biological data the team has gathered is publicly available, and the five publications the group has made so far are available for free on their website. All the software that OpenWorm has produced is completely free and open source.

Open Worm is also trying a radically open model of scientific collaboration. The team consists of anyone who wishes to be a part of it. There are over one hundred "members" who are signed up for the high volume technical mailing list. Of the most active members who are named on a publication there are collaborators from Russia, Brazil, England, Scotland, Ireland and the United States. To coordinate this international effort, the team uses "virtual lab meetings" and other online tools that are detailed in the resources section.

An '''overlapping generations model''', abbreviated to '''OLG model''', is a type of representative agent [[economics|economic]] model in which [[Agent (economics)|agents]] live a finite length of time long enough to overlap with at least one period of another agent's life.  As it models explicitly the different periods of life, - such as schooling, working or retirement periods --, it is the natural framework to study the allocation of resources
across the different generations.

== History ==
The concept of an OLG model was inspired by [[Irving Fisher]]'s monograph ''The Theory of Interest''.&lt;ref name="ABB29"&gt;{{harvtxt|Aliprantis|Brown|Burkinshaw|1988|p=229}}:&lt;p&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aliprantis |first1=Charalambos&amp;nbsp;D.|authorlink1=Charalambos D. Aliprantis| last2=Brown|first2=Donald&amp;nbsp;J.|last3=Burkinshaw|first3=Owen|title=Existence and optimality of competitive equilibria|chapter=5 The overlapping generations model (pp.&amp;nbsp;229–271)|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin|date=April 1988|edition=1990 student|pages=xii+284|isbn=3-540-52866-0|mr=1075992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable improvements were published by [[Maurice Allais]] in 1947,  [[Paul Samuelson]] in 1958, and [[Peter Diamond]] in 1965. Books devoted to the use of the OLG model include [[Costas Azariadis|Azariadis]]' Intertemporal Macroeconomics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wiley: Intertemporal Macroeconomics - Costas Azariadis|url = http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1557863660.html|website = eu.wiley.com|accessdate = 2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David de la Croix|de la Croix]] and [[Philippe Michel (economist)|Michel]]'s Theory of Economic Growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Theory of Economic Growth - 9780521001151 - Cambridge University Press|url = https://www.cambridge.org/asia/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521001151|website = www.cambridge.org|accessdate = 2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic model==

[[File:OLG model- Generation.png|thumb|Generational Shifts in OLG Models]]
The most basic OLG model has the following characteristics:&lt;ref name="LjungqvistSargent2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lars Ljungqvist|author2=Thomas J. Sargent|title=Recursive Macroeconomic Theory|date=1 September 2004|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-12274-0|pages = 264–267}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Individuals live for '''two''' periods; in the first period of life, they are referred to as the '''Young'''. In the second period of life, they are referred to as the '''Old'''.
*A number of individuals are born in every period. &lt;math&gt;N^{t}_t &lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of individuals born in period t.
*&lt;math&gt;N^{t-1}_t &lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of old people in period t. Since the economy begins in period 1, in period 1 there is a group of people who are already old. They are referred to as the ''initial old.'' The number of them can be denoted as &lt;math&gt;N_0 &lt;/math&gt; .
*The size of the initial old generation is normalized to 1: &lt;math&gt;N^{0}_0 =1&lt;/math&gt;.
*People do not die early, so &lt;math&gt;N^{t}_t = N^{t}_{t+1} &lt;/math&gt;.
*Population grows at a constant rate n:
::&lt;math&gt; N_t^t = (1+n)^t &lt;/math&gt;

*In the "pure exchange economy" version of the model, there is only one physical good and it cannot endure for more than one period. Each individual receives a fixed endowment of this good at birth. This endowment is denoted as ''y''. 
*In the "production economy" version of the model (see Diamond OLG model below), the physical good can be either consumed or invested to build physical capital. Output is produced from labor and physical capital. Each household is endowed with one unit of time which is inelastically supply on the labor market.
*Preferences over consumption streams are given by
::&lt;math&gt; u(c_t^t,c_t^{t+1}) =  U(c_t^t) + \beta U(c_t^{t+1}),&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is the rate of time preference.

==Attributes==

One important aspect of the OLG model is that the steady state equilibrium need not be efficient, in contrast to general equilibrium models where the [[First Welfare Theorem]] guarantees Pareto efficiency. Because there are an infinite number of agents in the economy (summing over future time), the total value of resources is infinite, so Pareto improvements can be made by transferring resources from each young generation to the current old generation. Not every equilibrium is inefficient; the efficiency of an equilibrium is strongly linked to the interest rate and the [[Cass Criterion]] gives [[necessary and sufficient condition]]s for when an OLG competitive equilibrium allocation is inefficient.&lt;ref name="Cass72"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cass| first1 = David | authorlink=David Cass| year=1972 |title= On capital overaccumulation in the aggregative neoclassical model of economic growth: a complete characterization | journal =[[Journal of Economic Theory]] | volume = 4| pages = 200–223 | doi = 10.1016/0022-0531(72)90149-4 | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another attribute of OLG type models is that it is possible that 'over saving' can occur when capital accumulation is added to the model—a situation which could be improved upon by a social planner by forcing households to draw down their capital stocks.&lt;ref name="Diamond65"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Diamond| first1 = Peter | authorlink=Peter Diamond| year=1965 |title= National debt in a neoclassical growth model | journal =[[American Economic Review]] | volume = 55| pages = 1126–1150 | issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, certain restrictions on the underlying technology of production and consumer tastes can ensure that the steady state level of saving corresponds to the [[Golden Rule savings rate]] of the [[Solow growth model]] and thus guarantee intertemporal efficiency. Along the same lines, most empirical research on the subject has noted that oversaving does not seem to be a major problem in the real world.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

A third fundamental contribution of OLG models is that they justify existence of money as a medium of exchange. A system of expectations exists as an equilibrium in which each new young generation accepts money from the previous old generation in exchange for consumption. They do this because they expect to be able to use that money to purchase consumption when they are the old generation.&lt;ref name="LjungqvistSargent2004"/&gt;

OLG models allow us to look at intergenerational redistribution and systems such as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Imrohoroglu | first1= Selahattin | last2=Imrohoroglu | first2 =Ayse | last3= Joines | first3= Douglas | year=1999 | title=Social Security in an Overlapping Generations Economy with Land | journal = Review of Economic Dynamics | volume =2 | issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

A OLG model with an aggregate neoclassical production was constructed by [[Peter Diamond]].&lt;ref name="Diamond65"/&gt; A two-sector OLG model was developed by [[Oded Galor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Galor| first1 = Oded | authorlink=Oded Galor  |year=1992 |title= A Two-Sector Overlapping-Generations Model: A Global Characterization of the Dynamical System| journal =[[Econometrica]] | volume = 60| pages = 1351–1386 | jstor=2951525 | issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike  the [[Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model]] the steady state level of capital need not be unique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Galor| first1 = Oded | authorlink=Oded Galor | last2 = Ryder| first2 = Harl E. |year=1989 |title= Existence, uniqueness, and stability of equilibrium in an overlapping-generations model with productive capital| journal =[[Journal of Economic Theory]] | volume = 49| pages = 360–375 | doi = 10.1016/0022-0531(89)90088-4 | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, as demonstrated by Diamond (1965), the steady-state level of the capital labor ratio need not be efficient which is termed as "[[dynamic efficiency|dynamic inefficiency]]".

===Diamond OLG Model===
[[File:OLG Model - Diamond.png|thumb|Convergence of OLG Economy to Steady State]]
The economy has the following characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carrol|first=Christopher|title=OLG Model}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Two generations are alive at any point in time, the young (age 1) and old (age 2).
*The size of the young generation in period t is given by N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; =  N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; E&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;.
*Households work only in the first period of their life and earn Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; income. They earn no income in the second period of their life (Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t+1&lt;/sub&gt; =  0)
*They consume part of their first period income and save the rest to finance their consumption when old.
*At the end of period t, the assets of the young are the source of the capital used for aggregate production in period t+1.So K&lt;sub&gt;t+1&lt;/sub&gt; = N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; where a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is the assets per young household after their consumption in period 1. In addition to this there is no depreciation.
*The old in period t own the entire capital stock and consume it entirely, so dissaving by the old in period t is given by N&lt;sub&gt;t-1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t-1&lt;/sub&gt; = K&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;.
*Labor and capital markets are perfectly competitive and the aggregate production technology is CRS, Y = F(K,L).

In Diamond's version of the model, individuals tend to save more than is socially optimal, leading to dynamic inefficiency. Subsequent work has investigated whether dynamic inefficiency is a characteristic in some economies&lt;ref name="Mankiw89"&gt;{{cite news|author1=N. Gregory Mankiw|author2=Lawrence H.

[[File:Pareto analysis.svg|A Pareto analysis in a diagram showing which cause should be addressed first.|right|thumb|400px]]
'''Pareto analysis''' is a formal technique useful where many possible courses of action are competing for attention. In essence, the problem-solver estimates the benefit delivered by each action, then  selects a number of the most effective actions that deliver a total benefit reasonably close to the maximal possible one.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Pareto analysis is a creative way of looking at causes of problems because it helps stimulate thinking and organize thoughts. However, it can be limited by its exclusion of possibly important problems which may be small initially, but which grow with time. It should be combined with other analytical tools such as [[failure mode and effects analysis]] and [[fault tree analysis]] for example.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

This technique helps to identify the top portion of causes that need to be addressed to resolve the majority of problems. Once the predominant causes are identified, then tools like the [[Ishikawa diagram]] or Fish-bone Analysis can be used to identify the root causes of the problems. While it is common to refer to pareto as "80/20" rule, under the assumption that, in all situations, 20% of causes determine 80% of problems, this ratio is merely a convenient rule of thumb and is not nor should it be considered an immutable law of nature.

The application of the Pareto analysis in risk management allows management to focus on those risks that have the most impact on the project.&lt;ref&gt;David Litten, [http://www.pmhut.com/project-risk-and-risk-management Project Risk and Risk Management], ''Retrieved May 16, 2010''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Steps to identify the important causes using 80/20 rule==
{{main|80/20 rule}}
# Form a frequency of occurrences as a percentage
# Arrange the rows in decreasing order of importance of the causes (i.e., the most important cause first)
# Add a cumulative percentage column to the table, then plot the information
# Plot (#1) a curve with causes on ''x''- and cumulative percentage on ''y''-axis
# Plot (#2) a bar graph with causes on ''x''- and percent frequency on ''y''-axis
# Draw a horizontal dotted line at 80% from the ''y''-axis to intersect the curve. Then draw a vertical dotted line from the point of intersection to the ''x''-axis. The vertical dotted line separates the important causes (on the left) and trivial causes (on the right)
# Explicitly review the chart to ensure that causes for at least 80% of the problems are captured

The '''pollution haven hypothesis''' posits that, when large industrialized nations seek to set up factories or offices abroad, they will often look for the cheapest option in terms of resources and labor that offers the land and material access they require.&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Arik|author2=M. Scott Taylor|title=Unmasking the Pollution Haven Effect|journal=[[International Economic Review]]|year=2008|volume=49|issue=1|pages=223–54|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2354.2008.00478.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this often comes at the cost of environmentally unsound practices. [[Developing country|Developing nations]] with cheap resources and labor tend to have less stringent [[Environmental law|environmental regulations]], and conversely, nations with stricter environmental regulations become more expensive for companies as a result of the costs associated with meeting these standards.  Thus, companies that choose to physically invest in foreign countries tend to (re)locate to the countries with the lowest [[environmental standard]]s or weakest enforcement.

==Three scales of the hypothesis==
#[[Pollution control]] costs have an impact at the margins, where they exert some effect on investment decisions and trade flows.
#Pollution control costs are important enough to measurably influence trade and investment.
#Countries set their environmental standards below socially-efficient levels in order to attract investment or to promote their exports.&lt;ref name="Four New Empirical Tests of the PHH"&gt;{{cite web|last=Millimet|first=Daniel|title=Four New Empirical Tests of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis When Environmental Regulation is Endogenous|url=http://econ.tulane.edu/seminars/Millimet.pdf|publisher=Tulane University|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scales 1 and 2 have empirical support, but the significance of the hypothesis relative to other investment and trade factors is still controversial.  One study found that environmental regulations have a strong negative effect on a country's [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]], particularly in pollution-intensive industries when measured by employment.  However, that same study found that the environmental regulations present in a country's neighbors have an insignificant impact on that country's trade flows.&lt;ref name="Four New Empirical Tests of the PHH" /&gt;

==Formula and variations==
:Yi = αRi + XiβI + εi

In the above formula, Y is economic activity, R is regulatory stringency, X is an aggregate of other characteristics that affect Y and ε is an [[error term]].&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe" /&gt; Theoretically, by changing your value of R, analysts will be able to calculate the expected effect on economic activity. According to the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, this equation shows that environmental regulations and economic activity are negatively correlated, because regulations raise the cost of key inputs to goods with pollution-intensive productions and reduce jurisdictions' comparative advantage in these goods. This lack of comparative advantage causes firms to move to countries with lower environmental standards, decreasing Y.

There is also an expanded formula, as shown below:

:Yit = vi + αRit + γTit + θRitTit + X’βit + εit

This expanded formula takes into account whether [[trade liberalization]] (i.e. the level of [[trade barrier]]s that exist in a country, labeled as T) increases the negative correlation between economic activity (Y) and regulatory stringency (R).  Some authors claim that trade barriers disproportionately effect the environment, and this equation attempts to quantify the interaction between trade barriers and regulatory stringency, and the corresponding effect with respect to output in an economy.&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe" /&gt;

== Connection with the environmental Kuznets curve ==
[[File:Environmntal Kuznets Curve.png|thumb|A simple recreation of the Environmental Kuznets Curve, made using Microsoft Excel.]]
{{see also|Kuznets curve}}

The '''environmental Kuznets curve''' (EKC) is a conceptual model that suggests that a country's pollution concentrations rise with development and industrialization up to a turning point, after which they fall again as the country uses its increased affluence to reduce pollution concentrations, suggesting that the cleaner environment in developed countries comes at the expense of a dirtier environment in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Exploring the Causality between the Pollution Haven Hypothesis and the Environmental Kuznets Curve"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ibara|first=Brian|title=Exploring the Causality between the Pollution Haven Hypothesis and the Environmental Kuznets Curve|url=http://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/econ_honproj/21|work=Honors projects|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the EKC is potentially a reflection of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, because one of the factors that may drive the increase in [[environmental degradation]] seen in [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial economies]] is an [[global waste trade|influx of waste from post-industrial economies]].  This same transfer of polluting firms through trade and foreign investment could lead to the decrease in environmental degradation seen in downward-sloping section of the EKC, which models post-industrial (service) economies. This model holds true in cases of national development, but cannot necessarily be applied at a local scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Human-Environment Geography|last=Moseley, Perramond, Hapke, Laris|first=William G., Eric, Holly M., Paul|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4051-8932-3|location=Oxford, UK|pages=179-180|quote=|via=Open edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real-world example==
Spent batteries that [[United States|Americans]] turn in to be recycled are increasingly being sent to [[Mexico]], where the lead inside them is extracted by crude methods that are illegal in the United States.  This increased export flow is a result of strict new [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] standards on lead pollution, which make domestic recycling more difficult and expensive in the United States, but do not prohibit companies from exporting the work and danger to countries where environmental standards are low and enforcement is lax.  In this sense, Mexico is becoming a pollution haven for the United States battery industry because Mexican environmental officials acknowledge that they lack the money, manpower, and technical capacity to police the flow.  According to ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2011, 20% of spent American vehicle and industrial batteries were being exported to Mexico, up from 6% in 2007, meaning that approximately 20 million batteries would cross the border that year.  A significant proportion of this flow was being smuggled in after being mislabeled as metal scrap.&lt;ref name="NY Times Lead Export Article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenthal|first=Elizabeth|title=Lead from Old US Batteries Sent to Mexico Raises Risks|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/science/earth/recycled-battery-lead-puts-mexicans-in-danger.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=14 April 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:E-waste dump site GDP per capita.png|thumb|Map of GDP PPP per-capita with known e-waste dump sites added in 2013.]]
The world map shown here illustrates how e-waste dump sites (or sites where citizens or multinational corporations of industrialized nations dump their used electronic devices) along with the [[Purchasing power parity|GDP PPP per-capita]] of those countries.&lt;ref name="e-waste dump locations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Where does e-waste end up?|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/the-e-waste-problem/where-does-e-waste-end-up/|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Used EEE &amp; E-Waste Import and E-Waste Generated in Kyoto Protocol Non-Annex I Countries.png|thumb|Shows an estimated amount of Used EEE and E-Waste imported into [[Kyoto Protocol]] Non-Annex 1 countries, with the E-Waste generated by each country's own domestic supplies.]] While GDP PPP per-capita is not a perfect indicator of economic development, and e-waste dump sites are only one small facet of what could be a greater pollution haven, this map does illustrate how e-waste dump sites are often located in poorer, relatively pre-industrial nations, which provides some rudimentary support for the Pollution Haven Hypothesis.

==Areas of controversy ==
The first area of controversy with respect to the Pollution Haven Theory has to do with the formulas above.  Finding an appropriate measure of regulatory stringency (R) is not simple, because we want to know how much more costly production is in a given jurisdiction relative to others due to that jurisdiction's environmental regulations.  The compliance costs stemming from these regulations, however, could come in the form of environmental taxes, regulatory delays, the threat or execution of lawsuits, product redesign, or emissions limits.&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe" /&gt; This proliferation of cost styles makes R hard to quantify.

Another major critique of the second formula is that it is difficult to measure regulatory stringency and trade barriers because the two effects are likely endogenous, so few studies have attempted to estimate the indirect effect of trade liberalization on pollution havens.  Furthermore, governments at times engage in inefficient competition to actually attract polluting industries through weakening their environmental standards.  However, as per conventional economic theory, welfare-maximizing governments should set standards so that the benefits justify the costs at the margin.  This does not mean that environmental standards will be equal everywhere, as jurisdictions have different assimilative capacities, costs of abatement, and social attitudes regarding the environment, meaning heterogeneity in pollution standards is to be expected.&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe" /&gt; By extension, this means that industry migration to less stringent jurisdictions may not raise [[efficiency]] concerns in an economic sense.

A final area of controversy is whether the Pollution Haven Hypothesis has empirical support.  For example, studies have found [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] evidence that countries with poor air quality do have higher net factor exports of coal, but the magnitude of the impact is small relative to other variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kellogg|first=Ryan|title=The Pollution Haven Hypothesis: Significance and Insignificance|year=2006|publisher=Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, UC Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Krugman]], a [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]]–winning economist, is skeptical as to whether pollution havens have empirical support in economic theory, as he writes, "At this point it's hard to come up with major examples of industries in which the pollution haven phenomenon, to the extent that it occurs, leads to international negative externalities. This does not, however, say that such examples cannot arise in the future."&lt;ref name="International Economics Theory &amp; Policy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=International Economics Theory and Policy|year=2006|publisher=Addison Wesley|isbn=9780321451347}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scale 3 above has had empirical arguments made specifically against it, especially in the last 20 years.  Some economists argue that once higher environmental standards are introduced in a country, larger multinational firms present in the country are likely to push for enforcement so as to reduce the cost advantage of smaller local firms.  This effect would make countries with strict environmental standards a haven for the large companies often associated with higher levels of pollution, meaning the polluting agents may be smaller companies, rather than the larger MNCs as theorized by other proponents of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Where Are The Pollution Havens?"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birdsall|first=Nancy|author2=Wheeler, David|title=Trade Policy and Industrial Pollution in Latin America: Where Are the Pollution Havens?|journal=The Journal of Environment &amp; Development|date=January 1993|volume=2|issue=1|pages=137–149|doi=10.1177/107049659300200107|url=http://jed.sagepub.com/content/2/1/137.full.pdf+html|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23147">In [[physics]], '''quasiparticles''' and '''collective excitations''' (which are closely related) are [[emergent phenomena]] that occur when a microscopically complicated system such as a [[solid]] behaves as if it contained different weakly interacting [[particle]]s in [[free space]]. For example, as an [[electron]] travels through a [[semiconductor]], its motion is disturbed in a complex way by its interactions with all of the other electrons and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]; however it approximately behaves like an electron with a different mass ([[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]]) traveling unperturbed through [[free space]]. This "electron with a different mass" is called an "electron quasiparticle".&lt;ref name=Kaxiras/&gt; In another example, the aggregate motion of electrons in the [[valence band]] of a [[semiconductor]] or a hole band in a metal&lt;ref name="ashcroftandmermin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashcroft and Mermin|title=Solid State Physics|date=1976|publisher=Holt, Reinhart, and Winston|isbn=978-0030839931|pages=299–302|edition=1st|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the same as if the material instead contained positively charged quasiparticles called [[electron hole]]s. Other quasiparticles or collective excitations include [[phonon]]s (particles derived from the vibrations of atoms in a solid), [[plasmon]]s (particles derived from [[plasma oscillation]]s), and many others.

These particles are typically called "quasiparticles" if they are related to [[fermion]]s, and called "collective excitations" if they are related to [[boson]]s,&lt;ref name=Kaxiras/&gt; although the precise distinction is not universally agreed upon.&lt;ref name=Mattuck&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pe-v8zfxE68C&amp;pg=PA10 	''A guide to Feynman diagrams in the many-body problem'', by Richard D. Mattuck, p10]. "As we have seen, the quasiparticle consists of the original real, individual particle, plus a cloud of disturbed neighbors. It behaves very much like an individual particle, except that it has an effective mass and a lifetime. But there also exist other kinds of fictitious particles in many-body systems, i.e. 'collective excitations'. These do not center around individual particles, but instead involve collective, wavelike motion of ''all'' the particles in the system simultaneously."&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, electrons and [[electron hole]]s are typically called "quasiparticles", while phonons and plasmons are typically called "collective excitations".

The quasiparticle concept is most important in [[condensed matter physics]] since it is one of the few known ways of simplifying the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[many-body problem]].

==Overview==

===General introduction===
[[Solid]]s are made of only three kinds of [[particle physics|particles]]: [[electron]]s, [[proton]]s, and [[neutron]]s. Quasiparticles are none of these; instead, each of them is an ''[[emergent phenomenon]]'' that occurs inside the solid. Therefore, while it is quite possible to have a single particle (electron or proton or neutron) floating in space, a quasiparticle can only exist inside interacting many-particle systems (primarily solids).

Motion in a solid is extremely complicated: Each electron and proton is pushed and pulled (by [[Coulomb's law]]) by all the other electrons and protons in the solid (which may themselves be in motion). It is these strong interactions that make it very difficult to predict and understand the behavior of solids (see [[many-body problem]]). On the other hand, the motion of a ''non-interacting'' classical particle is relatively simple; it would move in a straight line at constant velocity. This is the motivation for the concept of quasiparticles: The complicated motion of the ''real'' particles in a solid can be mathematically transformed into the much simpler motion of imagined quasiparticles, which behave more like non-interacting particles.

In summary, quasiparticles are a mathematical tool for simplifying the description of solids.

===Relation to many-body quantum mechanics===
[[Image:Energy levels.svg|thumb|right|Any system, no matter how complicated, has a [[ground state]] along with an infinite series of higher-energy [[excited state]]s.]]
The principal motivation for quasiparticles is that it is almost impossible to ''directly'' describe every particle in a macroscopic system. For example, a barely-visible (0.1mm) grain of sand contains around 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; nuclei and 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; electrons. Each of these attracts or repels every other by [[Coulomb's law]]. In principle, the [[Schrödinger equation]] predicts exactly how this system will behave. But the Schrödinger equation in this case is a [[partial differential equation]] (PDE) on a 3×10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;-dimensional vector space—one dimension for each coordinate (x,y,z) of each particle. Directly and straightforwardly trying to solve such a PDE is impossible in practice. Indeed, solving a PDE on a 2-dimensional space is typically much harder than solving a PDE on a 1-dimensional space (whether analytically or numerically); solving a PDE on a 3-dimensional space is significantly harder still; and thus solving a PDE on a 3×10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;-dimensional space is quite impossible by straightforward methods.

One simplifying factor is that the system as a whole, like any quantum system, has a [[ground state]] and various [[excited state]]s with higher and higher energy above the ground state. In many contexts, only the "low-lying" excited states, with energy reasonably close to the ground state, are relevant. This occurs because of the [[Boltzmann distribution]], which implies that very-high-energy [[thermal fluctuations]] are unlikely to occur at any given temperature.

Quasiparticles and collective excitations are a type of low-lying excited state. For example, a crystal at [[absolute zero]] is in the [[ground state]], but if one [[phonon]] is added to the crystal (in other words, if the crystal is made to vibrate slightly at a particular frequency) then the crystal is now in a low-lying excited state. The single phonon is called an ''elementary excitation''. More generally, low-lying excited states may contain any number of elementary excitations (for example, many phonons, along with other quasiparticles and collective excitations).&lt;ref&gt;''Principles of Nanophotonics'' by Motoichi Ohtsu, p205 [https://books.google.com/books?id=3za2u8FnCgUC&amp;pg=PA205 google books link]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the material is characterized as having "several elementary excitations", this statement presupposes that the different excitations can be combined together. In other words, it presupposes that the excitations can coexist simultaneously and independently. This is never ''exactly'' true. For example, a solid with two identical phonons does not have exactly twice the excitation energy of a solid with just one phonon, because the crystal vibration is slightly [[anharmonic]]. However, in many materials, the elementary excitations are very ''close'' to being independent. Therefore, as a ''starting point'', they are treated as free, independent entities, and then corrections are included via interactions between the elementary excitations, such as "phonon-phonon [[scattering]]".

Therefore, using quasiparticles / collective excitations, instead of analyzing 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; particles, one needs to deal with only a handful of somewhat-independent elementary excitations. It is, therefore, a very effective approach to simplify the [[many-body problem]] in quantum mechanics. This approach is not useful for ''all'' systems, however: In [[strongly correlated material]]s, the elementary excitations are so far from being independent that it is not even useful as a starting point to treat them as independent.

===Distinction between quasiparticles and collective excitations===
Usually, an elementary excitation is called a "quasiparticle" if it is a [[fermion]] and a "collective excitation" if it is a [[boson]].&lt;ref name="Kaxiras" /&gt; However, the precise distinction is not universally agreed upon.&lt;ref name="Mattuck" /&gt;

There is a difference in the way that quasiparticles and collective excitations are intuitively envisioned.&lt;ref name=Mattuck/&gt; A quasiparticle is usually thought of as being like a [[dressed particle]]: It is built around a real particle at its "core", but the behavior of the particle is affected by the environment. A standard example is the "electron quasiparticle": A real electron particle, in a crystal, behaves as if it had a [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|different mass]]. On the other hand, a collective excitation is usually imagined to be a reflection of the aggregate behavior of the system, with no single real particle at its "core". A standard example is the [[phonon]], which characterizes the vibrational motion of every atom in the crystal.

However, these two visualizations leave some ambiguity. For example, a [[magnon]] in a [[ferromagnet]] can be considered in one of two perfectly equivalent ways: (a) as a mobile defect (a misdirected spin) in a perfect alignment of magnetic moments or (b) as a quantum of a collective [[spin wave]] that involves the precession of many spins. In the first case, the magnon is envisioned as a quasiparticle, in the second case, as a collective excitation. However, both (a) and (b) are equivalent and correct descriptions. As this example shows, the intuitive distinction between a quasiparticle and a collective excitation is not particularly important or fundamental.

The problems arising from the collective nature of quasiparticles have also been discussed within the philosophy of science, notably in relation to the identity conditions of quasiparticles and whether they should be considered "real" by the standards of, for example, [[entity realism]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Gelfert, 'Manipulative Success and the Unreal', ''International Studies in the Philosophy of Science'' Vol. 17, 2003, 245–263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Falkenburg, ''Particle Metaphysics'' (The Frontiers Collection), Berlin: Springer 2007, esp. pp. 243–46&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on bulk properties===

By investigating the properties of individual quasiparticles, it is possible to obtain a great deal of information about low-energy systems, including the [[quantum fluid|flow properties]] and [[heat capacity]].

In the heat capacity example, a crystal can store energy by forming [[phonon]]s, and/or forming [[exciton]]s, and/or forming [[plasmon]]s, etc. Each of these is a separate contribution to the overall heat capacity.

===History===

The idea of quasiparticles originated in [[Lev Davidovich Landau|Lev Landau's]] theory of [[Fermi liquid]]s, which was originally invented for studying liquid [[helium-3]]. For these systems a strong similarity exists between the notion of quasiparticle and [[dressed particle]]s in [[quantum field theory]]. The dynamics of Landau's theory is defined by a [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic equation]] of the [[Mean field theory|mean-field type]]. A similar equation, the [[Vlasov equation]], is valid for a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] in the so-called [[plasma approximation]]. In the plasma approximation, charged particles are considered to be moving in the electromagnetic field collectively generated by all other particles, and hard [[collision]]s between the charged particles are neglected. When a kinetic equation of the mean-field type is a valid first-order description of a system, second-order corrections determine the [[entropy]] production, and generally take the form of a [[Boltzmann equation|Boltzmann]]-type collision term, in which figure only "far collisions" between virtual particles. In other words, every type of mean-field kinetic equation, and in fact every [[mean-field theory]], involves a quasiparticle concept.

==Examples of quasiparticles and collective excitations==
This section contains examples of quasiparticles and collective excitations. The first subsection below contains common ones that occur in a wide variety of materials under ordinary conditions; the second subsection contains examples that arise only in special contexts.

===More common examples===
{{see also|List of quasiparticles}}
*In solids, an '''electron quasiparticle''' is an [[electron]] as affected by the other forces and interactions in the solid. The electron quasiparticle has the same [[electric charge|charge]] and [[spin (physics)|spin]] as a "normal" ([[elementary particle]]) electron, and like a normal electron, it is a [[fermion]]. However, its mass can differ substantially from that of a normal electron; see the article [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]].&lt;ref name="Kaxiras"&gt;E. Kaxiras, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ULXZwEJeElYC ''Atomic and Electronic Structure of Solids''], {{ISBN|0-521-52339-7}}, pages 65–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Its electric field is also modified, as a result of [[electric field screening]]. In many other respects, especially in metals under ordinary conditions, these so-called Landau quasiparticles{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} closely resemble familiar electrons; as [[Michael F. Crommie|Crommie's]] "[[quantum corral]]" showed, an [[Scanning tunneling microscope|STM]] can clearly image their [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] upon scattering.
*A '''[[electron hole|hole]]''' is a quasiparticle consisting of the lack of an electron in a state; it is most commonly used in the context of empty states in the [[valence band]] of a [[semiconductor]].&lt;ref name="Kaxiras"/&gt; A hole has the opposite charge of an electron.
*A '''[[phonon]]''' is a collective excitation associated with the vibration of atoms in a rigid [[crystal structure]]. It is a [[quantum]] of a [[sound wave]].
*A '''[[magnon]]''' is a collective excitation&lt;ref name=Kaxiras/&gt; associated with the electrons' spin structure in a crystal lattice. It is a quantum of a [[spin wave]].
*In materials, a '''photon''' quasiparticle is a [[photon]] as affected by its interactions with the material. In particular, the photon quasiparticle has a modified relation between wavelength and energy ([[dispersion relation]]), as described by the material's [[index of refraction]]. It may also be termed a '''[[polariton]]''', especially near a resonance of the material. For example, an '''exciton-polariton''' is a superposition of an exciton and a photon; a '''phonon-polariton''' is a superposition of a phonon and a photon.
*A '''[[plasmon]]''' is a collective excitation, which is the quantum of [[plasma oscillation]]s (wherein all the electrons simultaneously oscillate with respect to all the ions).
*A '''[[polaron]]''' is a quasiparticle which comes about when an electron interacts with the [[polarization density|polarization]] of its surrounding ions.
*An '''[[exciton]]''' is an electron and hole bound together.
*A '''plasmariton''' is a coupled optical phonon and dressed photon consisting of a plasmon and photon.

===More specialized examples===
*A '''[[roton]]''' is a collective excitation associated with the rotation of a fluid (often a [[superfluid]]). It is a quantum of a [[vortex]].
*'''[[Composite fermion]]s''' arise in a two-dimensional system subject to a large magnetic field, most famously those systems that exhibit the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ptonline.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&amp;id=PHTOAD000053000004000039000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;bypassSSO=1 Physics Today Article]&lt;/ref&gt; These quasiparticles are quite unlike normal particles in two ways. First, their charge can be less than the [[elementary charge|electron charge]] ''e''. In fact, they have been observed with charges of e/3, e/4, e/5, and e/7.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/news/2038/curious-quasiparticles-have-a-quarter-charge-electron Cosmos magazine June 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609005023/http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/news/2038/curious-quasiparticles-have-a-quarter-charge-electron |date=9 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, they can be [[anyon]]s, an exotic type of particle that is neither a [[fermion]] nor [[boson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nphys681 | title = Fractional quantum Hall effect: A game of five halves  | journal = Nature Physics | volume = 3 | issue = 8 | page = 517| bibcode = 2007NatPh...3..517G| last1 = Goldman  | first1 = Vladimir J  | year = 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Stoner excitation]]s''' in ferromagnetic metals
*'''[[Bogoliubov quasiparticle]]s''' in superconductors. [[Superconductivity]] is carried by [[Cooper pairs]]—usually described as pairs of electrons—that move through the crystal lattice without resistance. A broken Cooper pair is called a Bogoliubov quasiparticle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.llnl.gov/str/Labov.html|title=Josephson Junctions|website=Science and Technology Review|publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from the conventional quasiparticle in metal because it combines the properties of a negatively charged electron and a positively charged hole (an electron void). Physical objects like impurity atoms, from which quasiparticles scatter in an ordinary metal, only weakly affect the energy of a Cooper pair in a conventional superconductor. In conventional superconductors, interference between Bogoliubov quasiparticles is tough for an STM to see. Because of their complex global electronic structures, however, high-Tc cuprate superconductors are another matter. Thus Davis and his colleagues were able to resolve distinctive patterns of quasiparticle interference in Bi-2212.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=J. E.

*A '''[[Majorana fermion]]''' is a particle which equals its own antiparticle, and can emerge as a quasiparticle in certain superconductors, or in a quantum spin liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A. |last1=Banerjee |first2=C.

*'''[[Magnetic monopole]]s''' arise in condensed matter systems such as [[spin ice]] and carry an effective magnetic charge as well as being endowed with other typical quasiparticle properties such as an effective mass. They may be formed through spin flips in frustrated pyrochlore ferromagnets and interact through a Coulomb potential.
*'''[[Skyrmion]]s'''
*'''[[Spinon]]''' is represented by quasiparticle produced as a result of electron [[spin-charge separation]], and can form both [[quantum spin liquid]] and [[strongly correlated quantum spin liquid]] in some [[minerals]] like  [[Herbertsmithite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shaginyan |first=V.

*'''Angulons''' can be used to describe the rotation of molecules in solvents. First postulated theoretically in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=Richard|last2=Lemeshko|first2=Mikhail|title=Rotation of Quantum Impurities in the Presence of a Many-Body Environment|journal=Physical Review Letters|year=2030|volume=114|issue=20|pages=203001|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.203001|pmid=26047225|bibcode=2015PhRvL.114t3001S|arxiv=1502.03447}}&lt;/ref&gt; the existence of the angulon was confirmed in February 2017, after a series of experiments spanning 20 years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3793">The '''rationalist–constructivist debate''' is an [[ontology|ontological]] debate within [[international relations theory]] between [[rationalism (international relations)|rationalism]] and [[constructivism (international relations)|constructivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abuaardvark.typepad.com/abuaardvark/2005/07/ir_constructivi.html|title=Abu Aardvark: IR: Constructivism v Rationalism|last=Lynch|first=Marc|date=July 25, 2007|work=Abu Aardvark|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1998 article, [[Christian Reus-Smit]] and Richard Price suggested that the rationalist–constructivist debate was, or was about to become, the most significant in the discipline of international relations theory.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Richard. Reus-Smit, Christian (1998) 'Dangerous Liaisons? Critical International Relations Theory and Constructivism', ''Journal of International Relations'', 4: 263&lt;/ref&gt; The debate can be seen as to be centered on preference formation, with rationalist theories (such as [[Neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]]) characterising changes in terms of shifts in capabilities, whereas constructivists focus on preference formation.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn R. Chafetz, Michael Spirtas, Benjamin Frankel (1999) ''The Origins of National Interests'', London: Frank Cass Publishers, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationalism==
Rationalists subscribe to [[positivism]], the idea that scientific enquiry must rely upon empirical validation or falsification.&lt;ref&gt;Zehfuss, Maja (2002) Constructivism in International Relations: Politics of Reality, Cambridge, University of Cambridge Press, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Rationalist theories such as [[Neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]] and [[neoliberalism (international relations)|neoliberalism]] also have exogeneously given preferences such as can be seen in Kenneth Waltz's ''[[Theory of International Politics]]'', where anarchy is a structural constraint on state behaviour.

==Constructivism==
Constructivists have been seen to challenge the assumptions of rationalism in arguing that the social world is constructed. They emphasize the importance of [[norm (social)|norm]]s and ideas in international relations.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Criticism==
Zehfuss argues that it is wrong to characterise the dialogue between the two theories as a debate due to the lack of debate between the two theories in key international relations journals.&lt;ref&gt;Zehfuss, Maja (2002) ''Constructivism in International Relations: Politics of Reality'', Cambridge, University of Cambridge Press, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Leading rationalist [[James Fearon]] and leading constructivist [[Alexander Wendt]] argued in an article in 2002 that some form of synthesis between the two theories is possible, and that the two perspectives should have been seen primarily as methodological tools rather than diametrically opposed ontologies.&lt;ref name="CarlsnaesRisse-Kappen2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fearon|first1=James|last2=Wendt|first2=Alexander|editor=Walter Carlsnaes |editor2=Thomas Risse-Kappen |editor3=Thomas Risse |editor4=Beth A Simmons|title=Handbook of International Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XMsXdZ2kUJMC|accessdate=10 November 2013|date=2002-03-13|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9780761963059|pages=52–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9810">In [[fluid dynamics]], the '''Reynolds stress''' is the component of the [[Cauchy stress tensor|total stress tensor]] in a [[fluid]] obtained from the averaging operation over the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] to account for [[turbulence|turbulent]] fluctuations in fluid [[momentum]].

==Definition==
The [[flow velocity|velocity field of a flow]] can be split into a mean part and a fluctuating part using [[Reynolds decomposition]]. We write

:&lt;math&gt;u_i = \overline{u_i} + u_i',\,&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; being the flow velocity vector having components &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; coordinate direction (with &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; denoting the components of the coordinate vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;). The mean velocities &lt;math&gt;\overline{u_i}&lt;/math&gt; are determined by either time [[average|averaging]], spatial averaging or [[ensemble average|ensemble averaging]], depending on the flow under study. Further &lt;math&gt;u'_i&lt;/math&gt; denotes the fluctuating (turbulence) part of the velocity.

We consider a homogeneous fluid, whose [[density]] ''ρ'' is taken to be a constant. For such a fluid, the components ''τ'''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; of the Reynolds stress tensor are defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau'_{ij} \equiv \rho\,\overline{ u'_i\, u'_j},\,&lt;/math&gt;

Another – often used – definition, for constant density, of the Reynolds stress components is:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau''_{ij} \equiv \overline{u'_i\, u'_j},\,&lt;/math&gt;

which has the dimensions of velocity squared, instead of stress.

==Averaging and the Reynolds stress==

To illustrate, [[Cartesian coordinates|Cartesian]] [[Euclidean vector|vector]] index notation is used. For simplicity, consider an [[incompressible flow|incompressible fluid]]:

Given the fluid velocity &lt;math&gt; u_i &lt;/math&gt; as a function of position and time, write the average fluid velocity as &lt;math&gt;\overline{u_i}&lt;/math&gt;, and the velocity fluctuation is &lt;math&gt;u'_i&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;u_i = \overline{u_i} + u'_i&lt;/math&gt;.

The conventional [[ensemble average|ensemble]] rules of averaging are that

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
    \overline{\bar a}   &amp;= \bar a, \\
    \overline{a + b}    &amp;= \bar a + \bar b, \\
    \overline{a \bar b} &amp;= \bar a \bar b.
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

One splits the [[Euler equations]] or the [[Navier-Stokes equations]] into an average and a fluctuating part. One finds that upon averaging the fluid equations, a stress on the right hand side appears of the form &lt;math&gt; \rho \overline{ u'_i u'_j} &lt;/math&gt;. This is the Reynolds stress, conventionally written &lt;math&gt; R_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; R_{ij} \ \equiv\   \rho \overline{ u'_i u'_j} &lt;/math&gt;

The [[divergence]] of this stress is the force density on the fluid due to the turbulent fluctuations.

==Reynolds averaging of the Navier–Stokes equations==

{{Main|Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations}}

For instance, for an incompressible, [[viscosity|viscous]], [[Newtonian fluid]], the [[continuity equation#Fluid dynamics|continuity]] and [[momentum]] equations—the incompressible [[Navier–Stokes equations]]—can be written (in a non-conservative form) as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_i}=0,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\rho \frac{Du_i}{Dt} = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x_i} + \mu \left(
\frac{\partial^2 u_i}{\partial x_j \partial x_j} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D/Dt&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lagrangian derivative]] or the [[substantial derivative]],

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{D}{Dt} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + u_j \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}.&lt;/math&gt;

Defining the flow variables above with a time-averaged component and a fluctuating component, the continuity and momentum equations become

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right)}{\partial x_i} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\rho \left[ \frac{\partial \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right)}{\partial t} + \left( \overline{u_j} + u_j' \right) \frac{\partial \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right)}{\partial x_j} \right] = -\frac{\partial \left( \bar{p} + p' \right) }{\partial x_i} + \mu \left[ \frac{\partial^2 \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right)}{\partial x_j \partial x_j} \right].&lt;/math&gt;

Examining one of the terms on the left hand side of the momentum equation, it is seen that

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \overline{u_j} + u_j' \right) \frac{\partial \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right)}{\partial x_j} = \frac{\partial \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right) \left( \overline{u_j} +
u_j' \right)}{\partial x_j} - \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right) \frac{\partial \left( \overline{u_j} + u_j' \right)}{\partial x_j}, &lt;/math&gt;

where the last term on the right hand side vanishes as a result of the continuity equation. Accordingly, the momentum equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\rho \left[ \frac{\partial \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right)}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right) \left( \overline{u_j} + u_j' \right) }{\partial x_j} \right] = 
-\frac{\partial \left( \bar{p} + p' \right) }{\partial x_i} + \mu \left[ \frac{\partial^2 \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right)}{\partial x_j \partial x_j} \right].&lt;/math&gt;

Now the continuity and momentum equations will be averaged. The ensemble rules of averaging need to be employed, keeping in mind that the average of products of fluctuating quantities will not in general vanish. After averaging, the continuity and momentum equations become

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial x_i} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\rho \left[ \frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \overline{u_i}\, \overline{u_j}}{\partial x_j} + \frac{\partial \overline{u_i' u_j'}}{\partial x_j} \right] =  -\frac{\partial \bar{p}}{\partial x_i} + \mu \frac{\partial^2 \overline{u_i}}{\partial x_j \partial
  x_j}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the chain rule on one of the terms of the left hand side, it is revealed that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \overline{u_i}\, \overline{u_j}}{\partial x_j} = \overline{u_j} \frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial x_j} + \overline{u_i} {\frac{\partial \overline{u_j}}{\partial x_j}},&lt;/math&gt;

where the last term on the right hand side vanishes as a result of the averaged continuity equation. The averaged momentum equation now becomes, after a rearrangement:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho \left[ \frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial t} + \overline{u_j} \frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial x_j} \right] = - \frac{\partial \bar{p}}{\partial x_i} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} \left( \mu \frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial x_j} - \rho \overline{u_i' u_j'} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the Reynolds stresses, &lt;math&gt;\rho \overline{u_i' u_j'}&lt;/math&gt;, are collected with the viscous normal and shear stress terms, &lt;math&gt;\mu \frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial x_j}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Discussion ==
The question then is, what is the value of the Reynolds stress? This has been the subject of intense modeling and interest, for roughly the past century. The problem is recognized as a [[Moment closure|closure problem]], akin to the problem of closure in the [[BBGKY hierarchy]]. A [[transport equation]] for the Reynolds stress may be found by taking the [[outer product]] of the fluid equations for the fluctuating velocity, with itself.

One finds that the transport equation for the Reynolds stress includes terms with higher-order correlations (specifically, the triple correlation &lt;math&gt; \overline{v'_i v'_j v'_k} &lt;/math&gt;) as well as correlations with pressure fluctuations (i.e. momentum carried by sound waves). A common solution is to model these terms by simple ''ad hoc'' prescriptions.

It should also be noted that the theory of the Reynolds stress is quite analogous to the [[kinetic theory of gases]], and indeed the stress tensor in a fluid at a point may be seen to be the ensemble average of the stress due to the thermal velocities of molecules at a given point in a fluid. Thus, by analogy, the Reynolds stress is sometimes thought of as consisting of an isotropic pressure part, termed the turbulent pressure, and an off-diagonal part which may be thought of as an effective turbulent viscosity.

In fact, while much effort has been expended in developing good models for the Reynolds stress in a fluid, as a practical matter, when solving the fluid equations using computational fluid dynamics, often the simplest turbulence models prove the most effective. One class of models, closely related to the concept of turbulent viscosity, are the [[k-epsilon turbulence model]]s, based upon coupled transport equations for the turbulent energy density &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; (similar to the turbulent pressure, i.e. the trace of the Reynolds stress) and the turbulent dissipation rate &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;.

Typically, the average is formally defined as an ensemble average as in [[statistical ensemble]] theory. However, as a practical matter, the average may also be thought of as a spatial average over some length scale, or a temporal average. Note that, while formally the connection between such averages is justified in [[equilibrium statistical mechanics]] by the [[ergodic theorem]], the statistical mechanics of hydrodynamic turbulence is currently far from understood. In fact, the Reynolds stress at any given point in a turbulent fluid is somewhat subject to interpretation, depending upon how one defines the average.

'''Section 15''' of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] contains guaranteed [[Social equality|equality right]]s. As part of the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]], the section prohibits certain forms of [[discrimination]] perpetrated by the governments of [[Canada]] with the exception of ameliorative programs ([[affirmative action]]) and rights or privileges guaranteed by or under the Constitution of Canada in respect of denominational, separate or dissentient schools ([[Section Twenty-nine of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|religious education]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Mendes|editor1-first=Errol|editor2-last=Beaulac|editor2-first=Stéfane |title=Charte canadienne des droits et libertés / Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|date=2013|publisher=LexisNexis Canada|location=Markham, ON|isbn=9780433471400|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rights under section 15 include [[racial equality]], [[sexual equality]], mental [[disability]], and physical disability. In its jurisprudence, it has also been a source of [[gay rights in Canada]]. These rights are guaranteed to "every individual", that is, every [[natural person]]. This wording excludes "[[legal person]]s" such as corporations, contrasting other sections that use the word "everyone", where "legal persons" were meant to be included. Section 15 has been in force since 1985.

==Text==
Under the heading of "Equality Rights" this section states: 
{{cquote|15. (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.

(2) Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.}}

==Background==
The [[Canadian Bill of Rights]] of 1960 had guaranteed the "right of the individual to equality before the law and the protection of the law."  Equal protection of the law is a right that has been guaranteed by the [[Equal Protection Clause]] in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] since 1868.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W. ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), 1067.&lt;/ref&gt;  Section 15 itself dates back to the earliest draft of the Charter, published in October 1980, but it was worded differently. It read,

{{cquote|(1) Everyone has the right to equality before the law and to equal protection of the law without discrimination because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age or sex.

(2) This section does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged persons or groups.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, pages 1062–1063.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the drafting, the guarantee to "everyone" was dropped in favour of "every individual," with the intent that corporations could not invoke equality rights.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, page 744.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, while the original version spoke of equality before the law and equal protection of the law, the section ultimately enacted included guarantees of equality under the law and equal benefit of the law. The reason for these additions was to encourage a generous reading of section 15. In the Bill of Rights cases ''[[Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell]]'' (1974) and ''[[Bliss v. Canada (Attorney General)|Bliss v. Canada]]'' (1979), Supreme Court Justice [[Roland Ritchie]] had said only the application, and not the outcome, of the law must be equal, thereby necessitating an explicit guarantee of equality under the law; and that legal benefits need not be equal, thereby necessitating an explicit guarantee of equal benefit of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, pages 1066–1067.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Charter itself came into effect on April 17, 1982, section 15 was not [[coming into force|brought into force]] until April 17, 1985, in accordance with [[Section Thirty-two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 32(2)]] of the Charter. The reason for this was so that provincial and federal governments would have enough time to review their legislation and make the appropriate changes to any discriminatory laws.

==Meaning and purpose of equality==
According to the Supreme Court of Canada's Section 15 jurisprudence, the equality guarantees of section 15 are aimed at preventing the "violation of essential human dignity and freedom through the imposition of disadvantage, stereotyping, or political and social prejudices, and to promote a society in which all persons enjoy equal recognition at law as human beings or as members of Canadian society, equally capable and equally deserving of concern, respect and consideration." (Iacobucci J. in ''[[Law v. Canada]]'', [1999])

To that end, the Charter recognizes four dimensions of equality, including [[substantive equality]].

* ''Equality before the law'' is equality in the administration of justice, where all individuals are subject to the same criminal laws in the same manner by law enforcement and the courts.
* ''Equality under the law'' is equality in the substance of the law, where the content of the law is equal and fair to everyone so that everyone experiences the same result.
* ''Equal benefit of the law'' ensures that benefits imposed by law will be proportionate.
* ''Equal protection of the law'' ensure that the protections imposed by law will be proportionate so that the human dignity of every person is equally safeguarded by the law.

Unlike formal equality, which overlooks personal differences, substantive equality is concerned with the impact of the law on different groups of individuals. Substantive equality requires that there be an equal impact on the person affected by the law.

==Application of section fifteen==
In any challenge of section 15(1) the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] is always on the claimant. The Supreme Court of Canada has endorsed a [[purposive interpretation]] of Section 15.

===Current interpretation===
After ''[[Law v. Canada]]'' (1999) the question of whether dignity was affected was key to a section 15 analysis. In ''[[R. v. Kapp]]'' (2008), the problems with the dignity analysis were recognized and the dignity analysis was jettisoned. The Court established a two-part test based on the one found in ''[[Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia]]'' (1989): (1) Does the law create a distinction based on an enumerated or analogous ground? (2) Does the distinction create a disadvantage by perpetuating prejudice or stereotyping?

In ''[[Quebec (Attorney General) v. A]]'' (2013) a majority of the Court found that perpetuating prejudice or stereotyping did not form an additional requirement in the second part of the test. The majority itself split on the correct way to apply the second part of the test, leaving the present state of the law on Section 15 unclear.

====Enumerated or analogous grounds====
[[Image:Hendricks-leboeuf2.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Discrimination based upon [[sexual orientation]] is an analogous ground for discrimination, leading all but two provincial courts to legalize [[same-sex marriage in Canada]].]]

The concept of ''enumerated or analogous grounds'' originated in the essential 1989 ''Andrews'' case to refer to personal characteristics that, when being the basis of discrimination, show the discrimination is unconstitutional under section 15. There are nine enumerated grounds explicitly mentioned in section 15, although they are not actually numbered. In practice, the enumerated grounds have been given liberal and broad interpretations. For example, discrimination on the basis of [[pregnancy]] has been ruled to be sex discrimination (''[[Brooks v. Canada Safeway Ltd.]]'').

As section 15's words "in particular" hint that the explicitly named grounds do not exhaust the scope of section 15, additional grounds can be considered if it can be shown that the group or individual's equality rights were denied in comparison with another group that shares all of the same characteristics except for the personal characteristic at issue. A personal characteristic is considered ''analogous'' to the ones enumerated in section 15 if it is "immutable" or cannot be changed or can only be changed at excessive cost (constructively immutable). Thus far, several analogous grounds have been identified:

* [[sexual orientation]] (''[[Egan v. Canada]]'' [1995], ''[[Vriend v. Alberta]]'' [1998], ''[[M. v. H.]]'' [1999]  ''[[Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada]]'' [2000])  This finding has led provincial courts (the Supreme Court declined in ''[[Reference re Same-Sex Marriage]]'' to rule on the issue as the government had voiced its intent to legalize them anyway) to find that laws against [[same-sex marriage in Canada]] would be unconstitutional. In ''[[Halpern v. Canada (Attorney General)]]'' (2003), the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] used section 15 to legalize [[same-sex marriage in Ontario]].
* [[marriage|marital status]] (''[[Miron v. Trudel]]'', [1995], ''[[Nova Scotia (Attorney General) v. Walsh|Nova Scotia v. Walsh]]'' [2002]),
* off-reserve aboriginal status/"Aboriginality-residence" (''[[Corbiere v. Canada]]'').
* citizenship (''[[Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia]]'', [1989], ''[[Lavoie v. Canada]]'' [2000])

As well, the courts have rejected several analogous grounds including:
* having a "taste for marijuana". (''[[R. v. Malmo-Levine]]'')
* employment status (''Reference Re Workers' Compensation Act'' [1989], ''Delisle v. Canada'' [1999])
* litigants against the Crown (''Rudolph Wolff v. Canada'' [1990])
* province of prosecution/residence (''[[R. v. Turpin]]'' [1989], R. v. S. (S.) [1990])
* membership in military (''[[R. v. Genereux]]'')
* new resident of province (''[[Haig v. Canada]]'')
* persons committing crimes outside Canada (''[[R. v. Finta]]'')
* begging and extreme poverty (''[[R. v. Banks]]'')

===Past interpretations: the Law test===
As first outlined in ''[[Law v. Canada]]'', discrimination can be identified through a three-step test.

# Did the ''law, program, or activity'' impose ''differential treatment'' between the claimant and a comparator group? That is, was a distinction created between the groups in purpose or effect?
# If so, was the differential treatment based on ''enumerated or analogous'' grounds?
# If so, did the law in question have a purpose or effect that is ''discriminatory'' within the meaning of the equality guarantee?

====Differential treatment====
This step asks whether there is a formal distinction between the claimant and a comparator group based on one or more personal characteristics or else does it fail to take into account the claimant's current disadvantaged position?

The selection of the ''comparator group'' is integral. They must possess all the qualities of the claimant except for the personal characteristic at issue. (''[[Corbiere v. Canada]]'' [1999] 2 S.C.R. 203)  In ''[[Hodge v. Canada (Minister of Human Resources Development)]]'' (2004), it was noted that a court may reject a claimant's choice for a comparator group, and that choosing the wrong comparator group may cause the rights claim to fail.

In ''[[Withler v. Canada (Attorney General)]]'' (2011), the Supreme Court has jettisoned the ''comparator group'' requirement, mandating that instead a contextual analysis is the way to go. They recognized that comparator group analysis was leading to much injustice, something also noted in ''R. v. Kapp''.

====Discrimination====
For discrimination to be found it must be determined if the burden or denial of benefit harms an individual's ''human dignity'' (''Law v. Canada''). That is, the discrimination will marginalize, ignore, or devalue an individual's sense of ''self-respect'' and ''self-worth''.

''Law'' suggests four "contextual factors" which  can help guide a contextual analysis of whether the imputed distinction violates the human dignity of the claimant. None of these are determinative of discrimination, and the Court must not consider all of them in every case. This list is also not exhaustive, although the standard ''Law'' analysis has yet to develop any additional factors:

# ''pre-existing disadvantage''
# ''correlation between the grounds of the claim and the actual needs, capacities, and circumstances''
# ''ameliorative purpose or effect of the law on more disadvantaged groups''
# ''nature and scope of interest''

Jurisprudence has shown that each of these factors are weighed differently depending on the context.

Pre-existing disadvantage asks whether there was a pre-existing disadvantage or vulnerability experienced by the claimant. In ''Corbiere v. Canada'' McLachlin described this factor to be the most compelling and suggestive of discrimination if proven. However, the absence of a pre-existing disadvantage does not necessarily preclude a claimant from succeeding as seen in ''Trociuk v. British Columbia''.

With correlation between grounds and reality, the claimant must show that there is a link between the grounds raise and the claimant's actual needs, circumstances, and capacities. Discrimination will be more difficult to establish if the law takes the qualities of the claimant into account. In ''[[Gosselin v. Quebec (Attorney General)]]'' [2002] the court was sharply divided on this point. The majority said that the law that provided less social assistance to youth was connected to the ability of youth to find employment easily. However, the dissenters insisted that the evidence did not show this to be actual qualities, but were rather stereotypes.

The ameliorative purpose factor asks whether there is a distinction made for the purpose of aiding an even less advantaged group. If this can be shown then it is unlikely that the claimant would be able to show a violation of their dignity. However, ''Lovelace v. Ontario'' warned that the analysis should not be reduced to a balancing of relative disadvantages.

The final factor of nature and scope considers the nature and scope of the interest affected by the law. The more severe and localized the results of the law for those affected the more likely to show that the distinctions in treatment responsible are discriminatory.

==Enforcement==
Section 15, like the rest of the Charter, is mainly enforced by the courts through litigation under [[Section Twenty-four of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|sections 24]] and 52 of the [[Constitution Act, 1982]]. Such litigation can be very costly.

To overcome this barrier, the federal government expanded the Court Challenges Program of Canada&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccppcj.ca/e/about/about.shtml Court Challenges Program of Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060411165618/http://www.ccppcj.ca/e/about/about.shtml |date=2006-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1985 to fund test cases challenging federal legislation in relation to the equality rights guaranteed by the Charter. Some funding has been provided to challenge provincial laws under a variety of programs in the past, but its availability has varied considerably from province to province.&lt;ref&gt;Arne Peltz &amp; Betsy Gibbons, [http://www.ccppcj.ca/documents/justice-e.html "Deep Discount Justice: The Challenge of Going to Court with a Charter Claim and No Money"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509063345/http://www.ccppcj.ca/documents/justice-e.html |date=2006-05-09 }}, 1999. URL accessed on March 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, the Conservative federal government announced that it would be "trimming the fat and refocusing spending on the priorities of Canadians." This included cutting all funding to the Court Challenges Program.&lt;ref&gt;Canada Department of Finance [http://www.fin.gc.ca/news06/06-047e.html "Press Release"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128092005/http://www.fin.gc.ca/news06/06-047e.html |date=2006-11-28 }}, URL accessed on December 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the newly elected Liberal government announced they would be providing $5 million annually to restore the Court Challenges Program.&lt;ref&gt;Canada Department of Finance [http://www.budget.gc.ca/2016/docs/plan/ch5-en.html "Budget 2016: Chapter 5 - An Inclusive and Fair Canada"], URL accessed on April 15, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The particular area of work is the concept of fully or partially self-powered dynamic systems requiring zero or reduced external [[energy]] inputs. The exploited technologies are particularly associated with self-powered [[sensors]], regenerative [[actuators]], [[human power]]ed devices, and dynamic systems powered by [[renewable resources]] (e.g. [[solar-powered]] [[airships]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9fBr7l-Lrw] Brunel Solar Powered Robotic Airship - Octoship.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0TMFUxOiFM] Brunel Solar Powered Autonomous Airship.&lt;/ref&gt;) as self-sustained systems. Various strategies can be employed to improve the design of a self-powered system and among them adopting a bio-inspired design is investigated to demonstrate the advantage of [[biomimetics]] in improving power density.

[[File:The concept of Self-powered Dynamic Systems.png|thumb|400px|The concept of self-powered dynamic systems]]

The concept of "self-powered dynamic systems" in the figure is described as follows.

I.	Input power (e.g. fuel energy powering a vehicle engine or propulsion system), or input excitation (e.g. vibration excitation to a structure) to the system. The source of this input energy can be of renewable energy source (e.g. solar power to a dynamic system).

II.	The kinetic energy in the direction of motion of a dynamic system is only recovered if the system is stationary (e.g. a bridge structure), or the recoverable energy is negligible in comparison with the power required for motion (e.g. a low powered sensor).

III.	The movement of the dynamic system perpendicular to the desired direction of the motion is usually the wasted kinetic energy in the system (e.g. the vertical motion of an automobile suspension is wasted to heat energy in the shock absorbers, or vibration of an aircraft wing is converted into heat energy through structural damping).

IV.	The vertical movement of the dynamic system is a source of recoverable kinetic energy.

V.	The recoverable kinetic energy can be converted to electrical energy through an energy conversion mechanism such as an electromagnetic scheme (e.g. replacing the viscous damper of a car shock absorber with regenerative actuator), piezoelectric (e.g. embedding piezoelectric material in aircraft wings), or electrostatic (e.g. vibration of a micro cantilever in a MEMS sensor).

VI.	The recovered electrical power can be stored or used as a power source.

VII.	The recovered electrical energy can power subsystems of the dynamic system such as sensors and actuators.

VIII.	The recovered electrical power can be realized as an input to the dynamic system itself.

Such self-powered schemes are particularly beneficial in development of self-powered sensors&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mestffk/] Farbod Khoshnoud, Houman Owhadi, Clarence W. de Silva, Weidong Zhu and Carlos E.

De Silva, Mechatronics—A Foundation Course, CRC Press/Taylor&amp;Francis. Boca Raton, FL, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Developing a self-powered sensor eliminates the use of an external source of power such as a battery and therefore can be considered as a self-sustained system.  A self-sustained system does not required maintenance (e.g. replacing the battery of the sensor at the end of the battery life). This is particularly beneficial in remote sensing and applications in hostile or inaccessible environments.

[http://m-w.com/dictionary/inequity "Inequity."] Retrieved 3 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Aversion''' is "a feeling of repugnance toward something with a desire to avoid or turn from it; a settled dislike; a tendency to extinguish a behavior or to avoid a thing or situation and especially a usually pleasurable one because it is or has been associated with a noxious stimulus".&lt;ref&gt;Merriam Webster Online. [http://m-w.com/dictionary/aversion "Aversion."] Retrieved 3 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The given definition of [[inequity aversion]] is "the preference for fairness and resistance to inequitable outcomes".

==Clarification through experiment==
{{See also|Inequity aversion in animals}}
To better understand and breakdown the concept of social inequity aversion would be to use the study done by [[Sarah Brosnan]] (as well as with Frans B. M. de Waal),&lt;ref name=Henrich&gt;[[Joseph Henrich|Henrich, Joseph]].[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v428/n6979/full/428139a.html#B1 "Animal Behaviour (Communication Arising): Inequity Aversion in Capuchins?"] 11 March 2004. ''Nature''. Issue 428. Retrieved 3 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; who specializes in social behavior and social cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Brosnan, Sarah. [http://www.physiology.emory.edu/FIRST/sarah.htm "Sarah Brosnan, Ph.D."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205204734/http://www.physiology.emory.edu/FIRST/sarah.htm |date=2005-02-05 }} Fellowships in Research and Science Teaching. Emory University School of Medicine. Department of Physiology. Retrieved 3 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In their experiment, "Monkeys Reject Unequal Pay" five female [[capuchin monkey]]s were used and given an unequal distribution of rewards by the human experimenter. The female monkeys alternated in pairs under four different conditions with the experimenter. Of the female monkeys, two received the same reward, one female received a superior reward, one female received a superior reward without exchange (for example without work), and a single female observed a superior reward in the absence of a partner.&lt;ref name=Mardle&gt;Mardle, Earl. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060220022206/http://www.kn.com.au/networks/2003/09/inequity_aversi.html "Inequity Aversion – Even a Monkey Can Pick a Raw Deal"]. A Networked World. Retrieved 3 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The females were much less likely to complete a trade with the human experimenter when their corresponding partner received a food item of higher value item (a grape; the lower item was a cucumber&lt;ref name=Henrich /&gt;), and when that partner received the higher food item with no exchange of work of any kind, the likelihood of not completing a trade intensified.&lt;ref name=Mardle /&gt; All of these refusals of exchange included both passive and active rejections ranging from refusing to take the awards to throwing the reward, respectively. These negative responses of situation made with the monkeys support the early evolutionary origin of [[inequity aversion]]&lt;ref name=Mardle /&gt; and thus helps (in combination with the definitions of inequity and aversion) give an overall idea of what social inequity aversion is: the tendency to reject or avoid situations in which there is [[social inequality]], unfairness, or injustice.

==In humans==
It is important to note that the experiment was done with capuchin monkeys and not humans, and because humans are not the only cooperative animals (monkeys being one of many examples), we cannot assume that inequity aversion is an exclusive human trait or nature.&lt;ref&gt;Brosnan, Sarah and de Waal, Frans B. M. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6955/abs/nature01963.html#a1 "Monkeys Reject Unequal Pay"]. 23 July 2003. ''Nature''. Issue 428. Retrieved 3 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been other experiments done with humans to test the validity of the inequity aversion theory proposed by Brosnan and de Waal. An experiment performed by Urs Fischbacher, Christina M. Fong, and Ernst Fehr called "Fairness, Errors, and the Power of Competition"&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, Ernst. Fischbacher, Urs. Fong, Christina M. [http://www.iew.unizh.ch/wp/iewwp133.pdf "Fairness, Errors, and the Power of Competition"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630134015/http://www.iew.unizh.ch/wp/iewwp133.pdf |date=2007-06-30 }}. Institute for Empirical Research in Economics. University of Zurich. December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; consisted of a multi-lateral ultimatum game where one contestant was put up against multiple ones.&lt;ref name=Henrich /&gt; In this experiment when the responders accepts the offer from the person giving the reward (say the 'provider'), the person giving the reward (the provider) gets his full pay. The key to this experiment is that the ability of one responder to affect the pay of the provider is lessened by all of the other responders' willingness to accept the reward. As a result, the concept of inequity aversion is followed, which says that the responders' willingness to reject the reward is lessened as well as the providers' offers.&lt;ref name=Henrich /&gt; (This is because in order to evade inequality or injustice due to unequal pay, all of the participants reduce their amounts to reduce the chance of unfairness). What's most important to realize in this experiment is that the outcome does not seem to agree with those of Brosnan and de Waal's capuchin experiment; humans will not reject the offer unless it affects others reward and/or pay.&lt;ref name=Henrich /&gt; So for humans, the original Fehr-Schmidt inequity aversion model, which was cited by Brosnan and de Waal in their capuchin experiment saying that the capuchin monkeys should always eat the lower value food, seems to hold validity. By not rejecting the reward offered, the humans decreased the amount of inequality. This was the opposite for the capuchins as they rejected the lower value food (cucumbers) when they couldn't get the higher value food (grapes) thus increasing the inequality, especially when the capuchins who received the grapes stole the discarded cucumbers, leaving the other monkeys with nothing. That increased the amount of inequality among the capuchins—The humans would only reject the reward if it reduced the reward of the individual who received the most.&lt;ref name=Henrich /&gt;

==Combining with social inequality==
According to Sarah Brosnan, "human beings have a similar approach, we do not live in a world of absolute values but one in which we are constantly comparing ourselves with those about us and, like a capuchin, we can tell when we are being short changed".&lt;ref name=Mardle /&gt; This can directly be connected to social inequality in that we as humans know what social inequality is and can identify it as an injustice; it is how we know that something such as unequal pay based on socioeconomic status is social inequality. However, according to the concept of social inequity aversion, we will not reject what is offered to us unless we realize that by rejecting what we are offered we will reduce another person's earnings or the earnings of the person who is giving to us, thus making our earnings closer to theirs, thus lessening the inequality.

One key example that links these two concepts could be that of the Neoclassical labor-market theory. Based on several important facts, this theory is based on the supposition that "(1) a relatively free and open market exists in which individuals compete for position. (2) Position in that markets depends heavily on the individual's efforts, abilities, experience, training, or '[[human capital]].' (3) There are automatic mechanisms that operate in the marketplace to ensure that imbalances between one's input (human capital) and one's rewards (wages) are corrected in a way to restore balance" (Hurst 231).&lt;ref name=Hurst&gt;Hurst, Charles E. ''Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequence''. 6th Ed. Pearson Education, Inc. USA. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is interesting in that the third fact that is assumed to be true in a labor-market theory would apply greatly to the concept of social inequity aversion. This is because it would seem that in order to get the reward that is expected we as people will take what is given to us for our skill. But when it becomes possible that our fellow citizen can get more than us, or that the company that is providing us with the reward (payments) gets more money from our labor/skill, then we as people in this labor market theory will reject the payments, and try to obtain a better one. We do this by trying to attain better resources for ourselves, such as "education, training, skills, and intelligence" (Hurst 231).&lt;ref name=Hurst /&gt; So take for example an African American woman, she will take the payment that all African American women are receiving. But once another African American woman begins to get better payment: via her better resources, other African American women will reject their current position as well as resources and seek more to in order to, maybe not directly lessen the payment that other African American woman, but to get more for themselves. This greatly illustrates the social inequity aversion concept when it comes to humans and how it crosses with the neoclassical labor market theory. However, because it is a continuous process in which different opportunities open up doors for individuals based on their life changes and access to better resources, an imbalance is made and a gap develops, thus separating individuals and creating ongoing social inequality (Hurst 231).&lt;ref name=Hurst /&gt;

The '''Swords of Truth''' is a Palestinian [[Islamist]] group based in the [[Gaza Strip]].

In 2007, the group threatened to behead female TV broadcasters who don't wear strict Islamic dress.&lt;ref name=hadid&gt;Diaa, Hadid, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/06/02/international/i105814D70.DTL&amp;type=politics Islamic Group Targets Women Newscasters], Associated Press, 2 June, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The threat was sent by e-mail to news organizations: "We will cut throats, and from vein to vein, if needed to protect the spirit and moral of this nation."&lt;ref name=hadid/&gt;

The group has previously claimed responsibility for bombing Internet cafes and music shops.&lt;ref name=hadid/&gt; The assailants used to detonate small bombs outside businesses at night, causing damage but no injuries.

According to a senior Palestinian security official The Swords of Truth has fewer than 100 members and was formed in 2006.&lt;ref name=hadid/&gt;

'''The KLF''' (also known as '''the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu''', '''The JAMs''', '''the Timelords''' and other names) are a British [[electronic music|electronic]] band started in the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;IMO Records. [https://archive.is/20120802004439/http://www.imorecords.co.uk/house-2/house-artists/klf-biography/ "The KLF Biography"], ''[[IMO Records]]' Retrieved on 29 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1987, [[Bill Drummond]] (alias King Boy D) and [[Jimmy Cauty]] (alias Rockman Rock) released [[hip hop music|hip hop]]-inspired and [[sampling (music)|sample]]-heavy records as the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, and on one occasion (the British number one hit [[single (music)|single]] "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]") as the Timelords. The KLF released a series of international hits on their own KLF Communications record label and became the biggest-selling singles act in the world for 1991.&lt;ref name="AMG"&gt;Bush, J., KLF biography, ''[[Allmusic]]'' ([{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4694/biography|pure_url=yes}} link])&lt;/ref&gt; The duo also published a book, ''[[The Manual|The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)]]'', and worked on a road movie called ''[[The White Room (film)|The White Room]]''.

From the outset, they adopted the philosophy espoused by esoteric novel series ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'', making [[anarchism|anarchic]] [[Situationist International|situationist]] manifestations, including the [[vandalism|defacement]] of billboard adverts, the posting of cryptic advertisements in ''[[NME]]'' magazine and the mainstream press, and unusual performances on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. In collaboration with [[Extreme Noise Terror]] at the February 1992 [[Brit Awards|BRIT Awards]], they fired [[machine gun]] [[Blank (cartridge)|blanks]] into the audience and dumped a dead sheep at the aftershow party. After this performance the duo departed the music business and, in May 1992, [[Deletion (music industry)|deleted]] their entire back catalogue.

With the KLF's profits, Drummond and Cauty established the [[K Foundation]] and sought to subvert the [[art world]], staging an [[K Foundation art award|alternative art award]] for the worst artist of the year and [[K Foundation Burn a Million Quid|burning one million pounds sterling]]. The KLF Communications catalogue remains deleted in the UK, but ''[[The White Room]]'' is still being pressed in the US by [[Arista Records|Arista]]. They have released a small number of new tracks since then, as the K Foundation, [[the One World Orchestra]] and most recently, in 1997, as [[Fuck the Millennium|2K]].

In 1986, Bill Drummond was an established figure within the British [[music industry]], having co-founded [[Zoo Records]],&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon, ''Rip It Up And Start Again: Post-punk 1978–1984'', {{ISBN|0-571-21570-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; played guitar in the [[Liverpool]] band [[Big in Japan (band)|Big in Japan]],&lt;ref&gt;"Big in Japan&amp;nbsp;– Where are they now?", ''[[Q Magazine]]'', January 1992 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=271 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916112152/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=271 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; and worked as manager of [[Echo &amp; the Bunnymen]] and [[the Teardrop Explodes]].&lt;ref name="TateTat"&gt;"Tate tat and arty", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 20 November 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=359 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004150534/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=359 |date=4 October 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 July he resigned from his position as an [[A&amp;R]] man at record label [[Warner Music Group|WEA]], citing that he was nearly 33⅓ years old (33⅓ [[revolutions per minute]] being the speed at which a [[gramophone record|vinyl LP]] revolves), and that it was "time for a revolution in my life. There is a mountain to climb the hard way, and I want to see the world from the top".&lt;ref name="specialk"&gt;"Special K", ''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]'' magazine (April 1995), quoting "a ringingly quixotic press release" issued by Drummond in 1986 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=397 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916115215/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=397 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; He released a solo LP, ''[[The Man (Bill Drummond album)|The Man]]'', judged by reviewers as "tastefully understated,"&lt;ref name="Trouserpress"&gt;[[Ira Robbins|Robbins, I.]], "KLF", ''[[Trouser Press]]'' magazine ([http://trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=klf link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305015031/http://trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=klf |date=5 March 2016 }}).

Trilogy]]'' and, in particular, their theme of [[Discordianism]], a form of post-modern anarchism. As an art student in Liverpool, Drummond had been involved with the set design for the first stage production of ''The Illuminatus! Trilogy'', a 12-hour performance which opened in Liverpool on 23 November 1976.&lt;ref&gt;The production was staged by [[Ken Campbell (actor)|Ken Campbell]]'s "Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool". [[Ian Broudie]] recalled meeting Drummond during the period of time that the play was staged, in a January 1997 interview with ''[[Mixmag]]'' ({{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id%3D433 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916110721/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=433 |archivedate=16 September 2016 |df=dmy }}).

Re-reading ''Illuminatus!'' in late 1986, and influenced by hip-hop, Drummond felt inspired to react against what he perceived to be the stagnant soundscape of popular music. Recalling that moment in a later radio interview, Drummond said that the plan came to him in an instant: he would form a hip-hop band with former colleague Jimmy Cauty, and they would be called the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu.

{{quote|It was New Year's Day ... 1987. I was at home with my parents, I was going for a walk in the morning, it was, like, bright blue sky, and I thought "I'm going to make a hip-hop record. Who can I make a hip-hop record with?". I wasn't brave enough to go and do it myself, 'cause, although I can play the guitar, and I can knock out a few things on the piano, I knew nothing, personally, about the technology. And, I thought, I knew [Jimmy], I knew he was a like spirit, we share similar tastes and backgrounds in music and things. So I phoned him up that day and said "Let's form a band called The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu". And he knew exactly, to coin a phrase, "where I was coming from". And within a week we had recorded our first single which was called "All You Need Is Love".|&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC Radio 1]] "Story Of Pop" documentary interview with Bill Drummond.

===The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu===
Early in 1987, Drummond and Cauty's collaborations began. They assumed alter egos&amp;nbsp;– King Boy D and Rockman Rock respectively&amp;nbsp;– and adopted the name the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (the JAMs), after the fictional conspiratorial group "The Justified Ancients of Mummu" from ''The Illuminatus! Trilogy''. The JAMs' primary instrument was the [[sampler (musical instrument)|digital sampler]] with which they would [[plagiarism|plagiarise]] the history of popular music, cutting chunks from existing works and pasting them into new contexts, underpinned by rudimentary [[beatboxing|beatbox]] rhythms and overlaid with Drummond's [[rapping|raps]], of social commentary, esoteric metaphors and mockery.

The JAMs' debut studio single "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)|All You Need Is Love]]" dealt with the media coverage given to [[AIDS]], sampling heavily from [[the Beatles]]' "[[All You Need Is Love]]" and [[Samantha Fox]]'s "[[Touch Me (I Want Your Body)]]". Although it was declined by distributors fearful of prosecution, and threatened with lawsuits, copies of the one-sided [[white label]] 12" were sent to the [[music journalism|music press]]; it received positive reviews and was made "single of the week" in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"All You Need Is Love" review, ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', 14 March 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=20 link])--&gt; A later piece in the same magazine called the JAMs "the hottest, most exhilarating band this year&amp;nbsp;.... It's hard to understand what it feels like to come across something you believe to be totally new; I have never been so wholeheartedly convinced that a band are so good and exciting."&lt;ref name="Sounds16May"&gt;"The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu", ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', 16 May 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

The JAMs re-edited and re-released "All You Need Is Love" in May 1987, removing or doctoring the most antagonistic samples; lyrics from the song appeared as promotional [[graffiti]], defacing selected billboards. The re-release rewarded the JAMs with praise (including ''NME''´s "single of the week")&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, D., "All You Need Is Love" review, ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 23 May 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=33 link])--&gt; and the funds necessary to record their debut album. The album, ''[[1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)]]'', was released in June 1987. Included was a song called "The Queen and I", which sampled the [[ABBA]] single "[[Dancing Queen]]".&lt;ref name="biog"&gt;"The KLF Biography", KLF BIOG 012, KLF Communications, December 1990([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=512 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916113659/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=512 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; After a legal showdown with ABBA&lt;ref&gt;Didcock, Barry, "Bitter Swede symphony", ''[[Sunday Herald]]'' ([[Glasgow]]), 21 October 2001, p4.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society]],&lt;ref&gt;News item, ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', 12 September 1987&lt;/ref&gt; the ''1987'' album was forcibly withdrawn from sale. Drummond and Cauty travelled to Sweden in hope of meeting ABBA and coming to some agreement, taking an ''NME'' journalist and photographer with them, along with most of the remaining copies of the LP.&lt;ref name=sweden87&gt;[[James Brown (editor)|Brown, J.]], "Thank You For The Music", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 17 October 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; They failed to meet ABBA, so disposed of the copies by burning most of them in a field and throwing the rest overboard on the [[North Sea]] ferry trip home. In a December 1987 interview, Cauty maintained that they "felt that what [they]'d done was artistically justified."&lt;ref name = "tune"/&gt;

Two new singles followed on The JAMs' "KLF Communications" independent record label. Both reflected a shift towards [[house music|house]] rhythms. According to ''NME'', The JAMs' choice of samples for the first of these, "[[Whitney Joins The JAMs]]" saw them leaving behind their strategy of "collision course" to "move straight onto the art of super selective theft".&lt;ref&gt;"Whitney Joins The JAMs" review, ''[[New Musical Express]]'', August 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The song uses samples of the ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'' and ''[[Shaft (1971 film)|Shaft]]'' themes alongside [[Whitney Houston]]'s "[[I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)|I Wanna Dance With Somebody]]". Drummond has claimed that the KLF were later offered the job of producing or remixing a new Whitney Houston album as an inducement from her record label boss ([[Clive Davis]] of [[Arista Records]]) to sign with them.&lt;ref name="X"&gt;Interview with Bill Drummond by Ernie Longmire, "KLF Is Going to Rock You" ''X Magazine'', July 1991 ([https://archive.is/20120708094940/http://cardhouse.com/x07/klf.html link])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bomlagadafshipoing"&gt;Transcript of a Bill Drummond interview on "Bomlagadafshipoing" (Norwegian national radio house-music show), September 1991 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=521 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004150538/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=521 |date=4 October 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"JAMs turn down Whitney", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 16 November 1991 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=261 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011154837/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=261 |date=11 October 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; The second single in this sequence&amp;nbsp;– Drummond and Cauty's third and final single of 1987&amp;nbsp;– was "[[Down Town]]", a dance record built around a [[gospel choir]] and "[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]]" by 1960s star [[Petula Clark]].&lt;ref&gt;Reviewed by ''[[NME]]'' writer [[James Brown (editor)|James Brown]] in the 28 November 1987 edition.&lt;/ref&gt; These early works were later collected on the compilation album ''[[Shag Times]]''.

A second album, ''[[Who Killed The JAMs?]]'', was released in early 1988. ''Who Killed The JAMs?'' earned the duo a five-star review from ''Sounds'' Magazine, who called it "a masterpiece of pathos".&lt;ref&gt;"Who Killed The JAMs?" review, ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', February 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Timelords===&lt;!-- there are section links to this header --&gt;
In 1988, Drummond and Cauty became "Time Boy" and "Lord Rock", and released a '[[novelty song|novelty]]' pop single, "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]" as The Timelords. The song is predominantly a [[mashup (music)|mash-up]] of the [[Doctor Who theme music|''Doctor Who'' theme music]], "[[Block Buster!]]" by [[The Sweet|Sweet]] and [[Gary Glitter]]'s "[[Rock and Roll (Gary Glitter song)|Rock and Roll (Part Two)]]".

Also credited on the record was "Ford Timelord", Cauty's 1968 [[Ford Galaxie]] American police car (claimed to have been used in the film ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace|Superman IV]]'' filmed in the UK). Drummond and Cauty declared that the car had spoken to them, giving its name as Ford Timelord, and advising the duo to become "The Timelords".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electronicbeats.net/style-icons-h-p-baxxter-on-the-klf/ |title=''Style Icons: H.P. Baxxter on The KLF'' |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2013 |website=electronicbeats.net |publisher=''Electronic Beats'' |access-date=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drummond and Cauty later portrayed the song as the result of a deliberate effort to write a number one hit single. In interviews with [[Snub TV]] and [[BBC Radio 1]],&lt;ref name="skinner"&gt;Bill Drummond interviewed by [[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]] on ''Saturday Sequence'', [[BBC Radio 1]], December 1990 ([http://www.brandnew.co.uk/klf/billdrummond/Bill%20Drummond%20Interview_Radio1%20Dec90.mp3 MP3]) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524180959/http://www.brandnew.co.uk/klf/billdrummond/Bill%20Drummond%20Interview_Radio1%20Dec90.mp3 |date=24 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond said that they had intended to make a house record using the ''Doctor Who'' theme. After Cauty had laid down a basic track, Drummond observed that their house idea wasn't working and what they actually had was a [[Gary Glitter|Glitter beat]]. Sensing the opportunity to make a commercial pop record they went instead for the lowest common denominator. According to the British music press, the result was "rancid",&lt;ref name="sounds-timelords"&gt;Wilkinson, R., "...Ford Every Scheme", ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', 28 May 1988 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=81 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916112637/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=81 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; "pure, unadulterated agony" and "excruciating"&lt;ref&gt;,"Doctorin' the Tardis" review, ''[[Melody Maker]]'', 28 May 1988 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=78 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916112326/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=78 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; and from ''Sounds'' "a record so noxious that a top ten place can be its only destiny".&lt;ref name="sounds-timelords"/&gt; The record sold over one million copies.&lt;ref name="select92"&gt;"Who Killed The KLF?", ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'', July 1992 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=315 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011034454/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=315 |date=11 October 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; A single of The Timelords' [[remix]]es of the song was released: "Gary Joins The JAMs" featured original vocal contributions from Glitter, who also appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' to promote the song with The Timelords.

The Timelords released one other product, a 1989 book called ''[[The Manual|The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)]]'', a step-by-step guide to achieving a number one hit single with little money or talent.

===The KLF===
By the time the JAMs' single "Whitney Joins The JAMs" was released in September 1987, their record label had been renamed "KLF Communications" (from the earlier "The Sound of Mu(sic)"). The duo's first release as the KLF was in March 1988, with the single "[[Burn the Bastards|Burn the Bastards"/"Burn the Beat]]" (KLF 002). Although the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu name was not yet retired, most future Drummond and Cauty releases went under the name "The KLF".

The name change accompanied a change in Drummond and Cauty's musical direction. As 'King Boy D', Drummond said in January 1988, "We might put out a couple of 12" records under the name The K.L.F., these will be rap free just pure dance music, so don't expect to see them reviewed in the music papers". King Boy D also said that he and Rockman Rock were "pissed off at [them]selves" for letting "people expect us to lead some sort of crusade for sampling".&lt;ref name="info88"&gt;Drummond, B., KLF Communications Info Sheet, 22 January 1988 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=501 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011172329/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=501 |date=11 October 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 he recalled that "We wanted to make [as the KLF] something that was ... pure dance music, without any reference points, without any nod to the history of rock and roll. It was the type of music that by early '87 was really exciting ''me''&amp;nbsp;... [although] we weren't able to get our first KLF records out until late '88".&lt;ref name="skinner"/&gt;

The 12" records subsequently released in 1988 and 1989 by the KLF were indeed rap free and house-oriented; remixes of some of the JAMs tracks, and new singles, the largely instrumental [[acid house]] anthems "[[What Time Is Love?]]" and "[[3 a.m. Eternal]]", the first incarnations of later international chart successes. The KLF described &lt;!--the sound of --&gt;these new tracks as "Pure Trance". In 1989, the KLF appeared at the [[Helter Skelter (rave music promoter)|Helter Skelter rave]] in [[Oxfordshire]]. "They wooed the crowd", wrote ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'' some years later, "by pelting them with&amp;nbsp;... £1,000 worth of [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|Scottish pound notes]], each of which bore the message 'Children we love you{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;Rimmer, L., "T in the Park: Greatest festival stories ever...", ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'' ([[Edinburgh]]) {{ISSN|0955-8756}} , EG MAGAZINE Edition, 8 July 2001, p7. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpHFtHwo_4Q Video] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418192720/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpHFtHwo_4Q |date=18 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1989, the KLF embarked upon the creation of a [[road movie]] and [[soundtrack album]], both titled ''[[The KLF films|The White Room]]'', funded by the profits of "Doctorin' The Tardis".&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, C. "Beam Me Up, Scotty&amp;nbsp;– How to have a number one (The JAMs way)", ''Offbeat'' Magazine, February 1989 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=94 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916113953/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=94 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the film nor its soundtrack were formally released, although [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] copies exist. The soundtrack album contained pop-house versions of some of the "pure trance" singles, as well as new songs, most of which would appear (in radically reworked form) on the version of the album which was eventually released to mainstream success. A single from the original album was released: "[[Kylie Said to Jason]]", an [[electropop]] record featuring references to [[Todd Terry]], [[Rolf Harris]], [[Skippy the Bush Kangaroo]] and BBC comedy programme ''[[The Good Life (1975 TV series)|The Good Life]]''. In reference to that song, Drummond and Cauty noted that they had worn "[[Pet Shop Boys]] infatuations brazenly on [their] sleeves".&lt;ref&gt;Sleevenotes, ''Indie Top 20 Volume 8'', published by Beechwood Music, catalogue number TT08, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film project was fraught with difficulties and setbacks, including dwindling funds. "Kylie Said to Jason", which Drummond and Cauty were hoping could "rescue them from the jaws of bankruptcy", flopped commercially, failing even to make the UK top 100. In consequence, ''The White Room'' film project was put on hold, and the KLF abandoned the musical direction of the soundtrack and single.&lt;ref name="info8"&gt;KLF Communications, "Information Sheet Eight", August 1990 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=508 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011034421/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=508 |date=11 October 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt;
Meanwhile, "What Time Is Love?" was generating acclaim within the underground clubs of continental Europe; according to KLF Communications, "The KLF were being feted by all the 'right' DJs".&lt;ref name="info8" /&gt; This prompted Drummond and Cauty to pursue the acid house tone of their Pure Trance series. A further Pure Trance release, "[[Last Train to Trancentral]]", followed. At this time, Cauty had co-founded [[the Orb]] as an ambient side-project with [[Alex Paterson]].&lt;ref name="century"&gt;{{cite book|last=Prendergast |first=Mark |title=The Ambient Century: From Mahler to Moby-The Evolution of Sound in the Electronic Age |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing PLC]] |year=2003 |isbn= 1-58234-323-3 |pages = 407–412}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ambient album ''[[Space (Jimmy Cauty album)|Space]]'' and the KLF's ambient video ''[[The KLF films|Waiting]]'' were also released in 1990, as was a dance track, "[[It's Grim Up North]]", under The JAMs' moniker.

The single, "What Time Is Love?", was released in August 1990. The follow-up, "3 a.m. Eternal", was released in January 1991. The album ''[[The White Room]]'' followed in March 1991.

The KLF's chart success continued with the single "Last Train to Trancentral" hitting number two in the UK, and number three in the [[Eurochart Hot 100 Singles|Eurochart Hot 100]].&lt;ref&gt;"History Rewritten: The KLF biography", sleevenotes, ''Mu'', [[EMI|EMI Japan]] TOCP-6916, October 1991 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=520 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916111655/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=520 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1991, a re-working of a song from ''1987'', "[[Justified &amp; Ancient]]" was released, featuring [[Tammy Wynette]]. It was another international hit—peaking at number two in the UK, and number 11 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100—as was "[[America: What Time Is Love?]]".

In 1990 and 1991, the KLF also remixed tracks by [[Depeche Mode]] ("[[Policy of Truth]]"), [[the Moody Boys]] ("What Is Dub?"), and [[Pet Shop Boys]] ("So Hard" from the ''[[Behaviour (Pet Shop Boys album)|Behaviour]]'' album, and "It Must Be Obvious"). Pet Shop Boy [[Neil Tennant]] described the process: "When they did the remix of 'So Hard', they didn't do a remix at all, they re-wrote the record ...

After successive name changes and dance records, Drummond and Cauty ultimately became, as the KLF, the biggest-selling singles act in the world for 1991,&lt;ref name="AMG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TimelordsGentlemen"&gt;"Timelords gentlemen, please!", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 16 May 1992 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=309 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011034313/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=309 |date=11 October 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; still incorporating the work of other artists but in less gratuitous ways and predominantly without legal problems.

===Retirement===
On 12 February 1992, the KLF and [[crust punk]] group [[Extreme Noise Terror]] performed a live version of "3 a.m. Eternal" at the [[BRIT Awards]], the [[British Phonographic Industry]]'s annual awards show; a "violently antagonistic performance" in front of "a stunned music-business audience".&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, N., "The Arts: My name is Bill, and I'm a popaholic", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (London), 2 March 2000, p27.&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond and Cauty had planned to throw buckets of sheep's blood over the audience, but were prevented from doing so due to opposition from [[BBC]] lawyers&lt;ref&gt;"Brits behaving badly", BBC News Online, 4 March 2000 ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/entertainment/2000/brit_awards/665776.stm link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315065845/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/entertainment/2000/brit_awards/665776.stm |date=15 March 2009 }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="baa"&gt;"Baa-nned!!

"Welcome To The Sheep Seats", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 29 February 1992 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=297 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916111310/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=297 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; The performance was instead ended by a limping, [[kilt]]ed, cigar-chomping Drummond firing [[blank (cartridge)|blanks]] from an automatic weapon over the heads of the crowd. As the band left the stage, the KLF's promoter and narrator [[Scott Piering]] proclaimed over the [[public address|PA]] system that "The KLF have now left the music business". Later in the evening the band dumped a dead sheep with the message "I died for you&amp;nbsp;– bon appetit" tied around its waist at the entrance to one of the post-ceremony parties.&lt;ref name="sheep-seats"/&gt;

Producer [[Trevor Horn]] is reported to have called their antics "disgusting".&lt;ref name="sheep-seats"/&gt; ''NME'', on the other hand, said that the KLF "stormed" the show and that after their performance the BRITs show went "downhill all the way".&lt;ref name="baa"/&gt;

[[Scott Piering]]'s announcement was largely ignored at the time. ''NME'', for example, assured their readers that the tensions and contradictions would continue to "push and spark" the KLF and that more "musical treasure" would be the result.&lt;ref name="sheep-seats"/&gt;

In the weeks following the BRITs performance, the KLF continued working with Extreme Noise Terror on the album ''[[The Black Room (The KLF album)|The Black Room]]'',&lt;ref name="select92"/&gt; but it was never finished. On 14 May 1992, the KLF announced their immediate retirement from the music industry and the [[deletion (music industry)|deletion]] of their back catalogue:

{{quote|We have been following a wild and wounded, glum and glorious, shit but shining path these past five years. The last two of which has [sic] led us up onto the commercial high ground — we are at a point where the path is about to take a sharp turn from these sunny uplands down into a netherworld of we know not what. For the foreseeable future there will be no further record releases from The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, The Timelords, The KLF and any other past, present and future name attached to our activities. As of now all our past releases are deleted&amp;nbsp;.... If we meet further along be prepared&amp;nbsp;... our disguise may be complete.&lt;ref name="TimelordsGentlemen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RetirementAd"&gt;KLF Communications advertisement in ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 16 May 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a comprehensive examination of the KLF's announcement and its context, ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'' called it "the last grand gesture, the most heroic act of public self destruction in the history of pop. And it's also Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty's final extravagant howl of self disgust, defiance and contempt for a music world gone foul and corrupt."&lt;ref name="select92"/&gt; Many of the KLF's friends and collaborators gave their reactions in the magazine. Movie director Bill Butt said that "Like everything, they're dealing with it in a very realistic way, a fresh, unbitter way, which is very often not the case. A lot of bands disappear with such a terrible loss of dignity". Scott Piering said that "They've got a huge buzz off this, that's for sure, because it's something that's finally thrilling. It's scary to have thrown away a fortune which I ''know'' they have. Just the idea of starting over is exciting. Starting over on what? Well, they have such great ideas, like buying submarines". Even Kenny Gates, who as a director of the KLF's distributors APT stood to lose financially from the move, called it "Conceptually and philosophically&amp;nbsp;... absolutely brilliant". [[Mark Stent]] reported the doubts of many when he said that "I [have] had so many people who I know, heads of record companies, A&amp;R men saying, 'Come on, It's a big scam.' But I firmly believe it's over". "For the very last spectacularly insane time", the magazine concluded, "The KLF have done what was least expected of them".

There have been numerous suggestions that in 1992 Drummond was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.&lt;ref name="select92"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, W., "Special K", ''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]'' magazine, April 1995 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=397 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916115215/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=397 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[1992] had been the year of Bill's 'breakdown', when the KLF, perched on the peak of greater-than-ever success, quit the music business, (toy) machine gunned the tuxedo'd twats in the front row of that year's BRIT Awards ceremony and dumped a sheep's carcass on the steps at the after-show party."

===K Foundation and post-retirement projects===
{{Main|K Foundation|Fuck the Millennium}}
The [[K Foundation]] was an arts foundation established by Drummond and Cauty in 1993 following their 'retirement' from the music industry. From 1993 to 1995 they engaged in art projects and media campaigns, including the high-profile [[K Foundation art award]] (for the "worst artist of the year").&lt;ref&gt;"The Best Of Artists, The Worst of Artists", ''[[New York Times]]'', 29 November 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=366 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916115344/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=366 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, M.

[[File:2K - Wheelchair.gif|thumb|left|The KLF come out of retirement for 23 minutes to make an appearance as 2K.]]
In 1995, Drummond and Cauty contributed a song to ''[[The Help Album]]'' as [[The One World Orchestra]] ("featuring The Massed Pipes and Drums of the Children's Free Revolutionary Volunteer Guards").&lt;ref&gt;Discogs.com entry for "One World Orchestra, The" ([http://www.discogs.com/artist/One+World+Orchestra,+The discogs.com link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215081017/http://www.discogs.com/artist/One%2BWorld%2BOrchestra%2C%2BThe |date=15 February 2013 }})&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Magnificent (song)|The Magnificent]]" is a [[drum and bass|drum'n'bass]] version of the theme tune from ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', with vocal samples from [[Fleka|DJ Fleka]] of Serbian radio station [[B92]]: "Humans against killing... that sounds like a junkie against dope".

On 17 September 1997, Drummond and Cauty re-emerged briefly as 2K.&lt;ref name="billboard"&gt;Flint, C. "Media Pranksters KLF Re-emerge As 2K", ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'', 2 September 1997 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=496 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916113139/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=496 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; 2K made a one-off performance at London's [[Barbican Arts Centre]] with [[Mark Manning]], [[Acid Brass]], the [[Liverpool Dockers]] and [[Alan Goodrick (Gimpo)|Gimpo]];&lt;ref&gt;"Justified and (Very) Ancient?", ''[[Melody Maker]]'', 20 August 1997 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=439 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916115111/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=439 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; a performance at which "Two elderly gentlemen, reeking of [[Dettol]], caused havoc in their motorised [[wheelchair]]s.

These activities were accompanied by the usual full page press adverts, this time asking readers "***k The Millennium: Yes/No?" with a telephone number provided for voting.

{{As of|2010}}, Drummond continues to work as a writer and conceptual artist, with occasional appearances on radio and television. Cauty has been involved in several post-KLF projects including the music and conceptual art collective [[Blacksmoke]] and, more recently, numerous creative projects with the aquarium and the L-13 Light Industrial Workshop based in Clerkenwell, London.

===KLF Communications===
[[Image:The KLF - Trancentral Logo.png|right|thumb|The KLF's 'Trancentral' logo: speakers arranged in a 'T' shape.]]
From their very earliest releases as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu until their [[The KLF#Retirement|retirement]] in 1992, the music of Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty was [[independent record label|independently released]] in their home country (the UK).&lt;ref name="discogs"&gt;KLF Communications profile at [[Discogs.com]] ([http://www.discogs.com/label/KLF+Communications link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615115823/http://www.discogs.com/label/KLF%2BCommunications |date=15 June 2013 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Their debut releases—the single "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)|All You Need Is Love]]" and the album ''[[1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)|1987]]''—were released under the label name "The Sound Of Mu(sic)". By the end of 1987 Drummond and Cauty had renamed their label to "KLF Communications" and, in October 1987, the first of many "information sheets" (self written missives from the KLF to fans and the media) was sent out by the label.&lt;ref name="Info1"/&gt;

KLF Communications releases were [[record distributor|distributed]] by [[Rough Trade Distribution]] (a spinoff of [[Rough Trade Records]]) in the South East of England, and across the wider UK by [[The Cartel (record distributor)|the Cartel]]. As Drummond and Cauty explained, "The Cartel is, as the name implies, a group of independent distributors across the country who work in conjunction with each other providing a solid network of distribution without stepping on each other's toes. We are distributed by the Cartel."&lt;ref name="the-manual"&gt;Drummond, B. &amp; Cauty, J. (1989) [[The Manual|The Manual (How To Have a Number One The Easy Way)]], KLF Publications (KLF 009B), UK. {{ISBN|0-86359-616-9}}.

Outside the UK, KLF releases were issued under licence by local labels. In the US, the licensees were [[Wax Trax]] (the ''[[Chill Out]]'' album&lt;ref&gt;''[[Allmusic]]'' review of ''Chill Out'' ([{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r11084|pure_url=yes}} link])&lt;/ref&gt;), [[TVT Records|TVT]] (early releases including ''[[The History of The JAMs a.k.a.

The Timelords'' ([{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r27962|pure_url=yes}} link])&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[Arista Records]] (''[[The White Room]]'' and singles&lt;ref&gt;''[[Allmusic]]'' review of ''The White Room/Justified &amp; Ancient'' ([{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r183594|pure_url=yes}} link])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bill Drummond explained the licensing situation—and inducements made by Arista—in an interview by Ernie Longmire, X Magazine, July 1991 ([https://archive.is/20120708094940/http://cardhouse.com/x07/klf.html link])&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;!--

Drummond and Cauty also published a book under the imprint "KLF Publications" ''[[The Manual|The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)]]'' (ISBN 0-86359-616-9).

The duo [[Deletion (music industry)|deleted]] the entire KLF Communications catalogue upon their 1992 retirement from the music industry.&lt;ref name="TimeGents"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RetirementAd"/&gt;--&gt;

The KLF Communications catalogue remains deleted in the United Kingdom.

===2017 reunion===
On 5 January 2017, the ''Eastfolk Chronicle'' reported on the reunion of the duo; a poster in [[Hackney, London]] that was spotted by the newspaper's editor Cally Callomon, who is also manager for Drummond, with the heading "2017: What the Fuck Is Going On?", announced a return for the duo as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu on 23 August 2017, and asked those seeking further information to contact K2 Plant Hire Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doran|first1=John|title=KLF Announce Return After 23 Year Absence|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/21514-klf-jamms-to-return-slam-film|website=The Quietus|accessdate=5 January 2017|date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; K2 has been registered in Drummond and Cauty's names at Companies House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/03013255|title=K2 PLANT HIRE LIMITED - Overview (free company information from Companies House)|website=beta.companieshouse.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 23 seconds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-41022272|title=The return of the band who burned £1m|date=23 August 2017|website=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bidolito.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bidolito.co.uk/jams/|title=Welcome To The Dark Ages|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="superweirdsubstance.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superweirdsubstance.com/jams-klf-dark-ages/|title=Welcome To The Dark Ages: The JAMs Return - Super Weird Substance|date=30 August 2017|website=Superweirdsubstance.com|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; past midnight on 23 August, the KLF returned in an ice-cream van to a book signing in [[Liverpool]] of their new book ''2023: A Trilogy by the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu'', described as "a multi-layered, self-referential meta tale."&lt;ref name=gua2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ellis-Petersen|first1=Hannah|title=The return of the KLF: pop's greatest provocateurs take on a post-truth world|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/23/klf-bill-drummond-jimmy-cauty-2023-book|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paterson|first1=Colin|title=The KLF return 23 years after bowing out of the music industry|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/entertainment-arts-41023934/the-klf-return-23-years-after-bowing-out-of-the-music-industry|website=BBC News|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the book signing, Cauty and Drummond staged three days of events along with 400 volunteers under the banner of "Welcome To The Dark Ages".&lt;ref name="bidolito.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="superweirdsubstance.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://welcometothedarkagespage130.com|title=The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu present Welcome To The Dark Ages by Page 130|website=The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu present Welcome To The Dark Ages by Page 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welcometothedarkages.com|title=Welcome To The Dark Ages – Welcome To The Dark Ages – The JAMs / The KLF – Liverpool – August 23rd – 25th, 2017|website=Welcometothedarkages.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Several threads and themes unify the many incarnations of Drummond and Cauty's creative partnership. Mostly these are esoteric or opaque in nature, which has led ''Melody Maker'' to compare them to [[The Residents]].&lt;ref name="Stubbs"&gt;Stubbs, D. "Pranks for the Memory", ''[[Melody Maker]]'', 16 February 1991 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=202 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916114935/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=202 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In his book ''[[45 (book)|45]]'' (Little &amp; Brown, {{ISBN|0-316-85385-2}} / Abacus, {{ISBN|0-349-11289-4}}), Drummond documented his love of The Residents as a concept ([http://www.theresidents.co.uk/articles/books/art_drum.html link]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}).&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond and Cauty have also been compared to [[Stewart Home]] and the [[Neoism|Neoists]].&lt;ref&gt;Extract from a feature on [[Stewart Home]]. Cornwell, J. ''[[i-D]]'' Magazine, Nov 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=354 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916121143/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=354 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Home himself said that the duo's work "has much more in common with the Neoist, Plagiarist and [[Art Strike 1990-1993|Art Strike]] movements of the nineteen-eighties than with the [[Situationist International|Situationist]] avant-garde of the fifties and sixties." Drummond and Cauty "represent a vital and innovative strand within contemporary culture", he added.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stewart Home|Home, S.]], "Doctorin' Our Culture", published on the website of The Stewart Home Society ([http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/klf.htm link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314035101/http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/klf.htm |date=14 March 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Illuminatus!''===
Drummond and Cauty made heavy references to [[Discordianism]], popularised by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]] in the ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy|Illuminatus!]]'' books, written between 1969 and 1971. Throughout the partnership, these tactics were often interpreted by media commentators as "[[Situationist prank]]s" or "[[publicity stunt]]s".&lt;ref name="Vincentelli04"&gt;Vincentelli, Elisabeth (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=yoCV0eaetb0C ''ABBA gold''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511084103/https://books.google.com/books?id=yoCV0eaetb0C |date=11 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Drummond, "That's just the way it was interpreted. We've always loathed the word scam. I know no-one's ever going to believe us, but we never felt we went out and did things to get reactions. Everything we've done has just been on a gut level instinct."&lt;ref&gt;Morton, R., "One Coronation Under A Groove", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 22 January 1991 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=191 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004150446/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=191 |date=4 October 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; Cauty has expressed similar feelings, saying of the KLF, "I think it worked because we really meant it."&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;

The number [[23 (numerology)|23]] is a theme of ''Illuminatus!'', where instances of the number are both overtly and surreptitiously placed.
&lt;!--NOTE TO EDITORS: the following list is a *representative* selection to illustrate the types of occurrence of 23--&gt;
* In lyrics to the song "Next" from the album ''1987'': "23 years is a mighty long time".
* They reportedly signed a contract preventing either of them from publicly discussing the burning of a million pounds for a period of 23 years;&lt;ref&gt;K Foundation, "Cape Wrath" advertisement, in ''[[The Guardian]]'' (''G2''), 8 December 1995([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=519 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916113827/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=519 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; their 1997 return as 2K was "for 23 minutes only".&lt;ref name="2K"&gt;2K press advert ([http://www.mutelibtech.com/mute/2k/2k1.htm link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327005822/http://www.mutelibtech.com/mute/2k/2k1.htm |date=27 March 2006 }}, [http://www.mutelibtech.com/mute/2k/2kpress.htm overview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327002924/http://www.mutelibtech.com/mute/2k/2kpress.htm |date=27 March 2006 }})&lt;/ref&gt;
* In numbering schemes: for instance, the debut single "All You Need Is Love" took the catalogue number JAMS 23, while the final KLF Communications Information Sheet was numbered 23; and Cauty's Ford Galaxie police car had on its roof the identification mark 23.
* In significant dates during their work: for instance, a rare public appearance by the KLF, at the Liverpool Festival of Comedy, was on 23 June 1991; they announced the winner of the K Foundation award on 23 November 1993;&lt;ref&gt;"K-Foundation nailed", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 11 December 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=368 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916115513/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=368 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; and they burned one million pounds on 23 August 1994.&lt;ref name="burning"/&gt;
* The 2017 reunion happened at 00:23 on 23 August, 23 years after the KLF ended in 1994, with the release of a book entitled ''2023: A Trilogy''.&lt;ref name=gua2017/&gt;

When questioned on the importance that he attaches to this number, Drummond has been evasive, responding enigmatically "I know. But I'm not going to tell, because then other people would have to stop having to wonder and the thing about beauty is for other people to wonder at it. It's not very beautiful once you know."&lt;ref name="i-D"&gt;"Freak Show", ''[[i-D]]'' magazine, December 1994 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=392 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916111453/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=392 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Pyramid Blaster"&lt;ref name="info8" /&gt; is a logo and [[iconography|icon]] frequently and prominently depicted within the duo's collective work: a [[pyramid]], in front of which is suspended a [[boombox|ghetto blaster]] displaying the word "Justified". This references the [[Eye of Providence|All-Seeing Eye]] icon, often depicted as an eye within a triangle or pyramid, a significant symbol of ''Illuminatus!'' The pyramid was also a theme of the duo's 1997 re-emergence, with the proposed building by [[Fuck the Millenium#K2 Plant Hire|K2 Plant Hire]] of "a massive pyramid containing one brick for every person born in the UK during the 20th century".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fortean Times]]'', referencing ''[[The Big Issue]]'', 15 September 1997 and ''[[The Guardian]]'', 5 November 1997 ([http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/107_sdays.shtml link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504220313/http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/107_sdays.shtml |date=4 May 2006 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

KLF has been variously reported as being an [[initialism]] for "Kopyright Liberation Front",&lt;ref name="Strong"&gt;Strong, Martin C. (1999) ''The Great Alternative &amp; Indie Discography'', Canongate, {{ISBN|0-86241-913-1}}, p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; and "Kings of the Low Frequencies".

Although Drummond accounted for the adoption of the JAMs name in the first KLF Communications Info Sheet,&lt;ref name="Info1"&gt;Drummond, B. (1987), ''KLF Info Sheet Oct 1987'' ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=500 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311225447/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=500 |date=11 March 2007 }})&lt;/ref&gt; the reasoning behind Drummond and Cauty's decision to reference the ''Illuminatus!'' mythology with such consistent intricacy is unknown. Indeed, it has been suggested by journalist [[Steven Poole]] that the public's inability to understand the KLF fully results in all their subsequent activities (as a partnership or otherwise) being absorbed into the KLF's mystique. In a review of Drummond's 1999 book, ''45'', and an appraisal of the KLF's career, Poole stated that "[Bill Drummond] and collaborator Jimmy Cauty are the only true [[conceptual art]]ists of the [1990s]. And for all the [[wikt:eldritch|eldritch]] beauty of their art, their most successful creation is the myth they have built around themselves."&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Poole|Poole, S.]], "Hit man, myth maker—''45''", ''[[The Observer]]'', 26 February 2000 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=487 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916112918/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=487 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded,

{{quote|A myth like the KLF's is peculiarly omnivorous. Just as there can never be any evidence to disprove a conspiracy theory because the fabrication of such evidence&amp;nbsp;– don't you see?&amp;nbsp;– is itself part of the conspiracy, so the pop myth of the KLF can never be blown apart by anything they do, no matter how dumb or embarrassing. The myth will suck it up, like a black hole.}}

===Trancentral, eternity, sheep===
Trancentral (aka the Benio&lt;ref&gt;Mead, H. (1990), ''Chill Out'' review, ''[[New Musical Express]]'' ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=123 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916112531/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=123 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;) was their studios. Despite the grandiose lyrics of "[[Last Train to Trancentral]]", Trancentral was in fact Cauty's residence in [[Stockwell]], [[South London]] ({{Coord|51.471373|-0.128167|display=inline|name=55 Jeffrey's Road, Stockwell, London}}), "a large and rather grotty [[squatting|squat]]" according to ''[[Melody Maker]]'''s David Stubbs: "Jimmy has lived [there] for 12 years. ('I hate the place. I've no alternative but to live here.') There's little evidence of fame or fortune. The kitchen is heated by means of leaving the three functioning gas rings on at full blast until the fumes make us all feel stoned&amp;nbsp;.... And, pinned just above a working top cluttered with chipped mugs is a letter from a five-year-old fan, featuring a crayon drawing of the band."&lt;ref name="Stubbs"/&gt;

Following the February 1990 release of ''Chill Out'', [[sheep]] had recurring roles in the duo's output until their 1992 retirement.&lt;ref name="sheep-seats"/&gt; Drummond has claimed that the use of sheep on the ''Chill Out'' cover was intended to evoke contemporary rural [[rave]]s&lt;ref name="X" /&gt; and the cover of the [[Pink Floyd]] album [[Atom Heart Mother]].&lt;ref name="17book"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Drummond | first = Bill | authorlink = Bill Drummond | coauthors = | title = 17 | publisher = Beautiful Books | date = | location = | page = 410 | url = http://www.the17.org | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-1-905636-26-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceremonies and journeys===
Drummond and Cauty's work often involved notions of ceremony and journey. Journeys are the subject of the KLF Communications recordings ''Chill Out'', ''Space'', "Last Train to Trancentral", "Justified &amp; Ancient" and "America: What Time Is Love?", as well as the aborted film project ''The White Room''. The ''Chill Out'' album depicts a journey across the [[U.S. Gulf Coast]]. In his book ''45'', Drummond expressed his admiration for the work of artist [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]], who incorporates physical journeys into his art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Drummond|Drummond, B.]], "A Smell Of Money Under Ground", ''[[45 (book)|45]]'', Little &amp; Brown, {{ISBN|0-316-85385-2}} / Abacus, {{ISBN|0-349-11289-4}}, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fire and [[sacrifice]] were recurring ceremonial themes: Drummond and Cauty made fires to dispose of their illegal debut album and to sacrifice the KLF's profits; their dead sheep gesture of 1992 carried a sacrificial message. The KLF's short film ''[[The KLF films|The Rites of Mu]]'' depicts their celebration of the 1991 [[Midsummer|summer solstice]] on the [[Hebrides|Hebridean]] island of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]]: a {{convert|60|ft|m|sing=on}} tall [[Wicker Man|wicker man]] was burnt at a ceremony in which journalists were asked to wear yellow and grey robes and join a [[chant]].&lt;ref name="i-D" /&gt;

===Promotion===
[[File:K-Foundation - Fuck the Millenium Advert.jpg|thumb|upright|A K2 Plant Hire advertisement, exhibiting the stark quality of Drummond and Cauty's press adverts, and the characteristic typeface]]
Drummond and Cauty were renowned for their distinctive and humorous public appearances (including several on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''), at which they were often costumed.&lt;ref name="Stubbs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frith, M., "The Return of The KLF", ''[[SKY magazine|Sky]]'', October 1997 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=445 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916113500/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=445 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; They granted few interviews, communicating instead via semi-regular newsletters, or cryptically phrased full-page adverts in UK national newspapers and the music press. Such adverts were typically stark, comprising large white lettering on black.

From the outset of their collaborations, Drummond and Cauty practised the [[guerrilla communication]] tactic that they described as "illegal but effective use of [[graffiti]] on [[billboard (advertising)|billboards]] and public buildings" in which "the original meaning of the advert would be totally subverted".&lt;ref name="biog" /&gt; Much as the JAMs' early recordings carried messages on the back of existing musical works, their promotional graffiti often derived its potency from the context in which it was placed. For instance, The JAMs' "SHAG SHAG SHAG" graffiti, coinciding with their release of "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)|All You Need Is Love]]", was drawn over the "HALO HALO HALO" slogan of a ''[[Today (UK newspaper)|Today]]'' billboard that depicted [[Greater Manchester]] Police Chief Constable [[James Anderton]],&lt;ref name="Sounds16May"/&gt; who had decried [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] amidst the UK media's AIDS furore.&lt;ref&gt;For a general overview see: "The 1980s AIDS campaign", ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/4348096.stm Article on the BBC website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115085729/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/4348096.stm |date=15 January 2009 }}. Retrieved 26 April 2006. A fuller set of references are available in the article "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Music press journalists were occasionally invited to witness the defacements. In December 1987, a ''Melody Maker'' reporter was in attendance to see Cauty reverse his car Ford Timelord alongside a billboard and stand on its roof to graffiti a [[Christmas]] message from the JAMs.&lt;ref name="tune"&gt;Smith, M., "The Great TUNE Robbery", ''[[Melody Maker]]'', 12 December 1987 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=52 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004211026/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=52 |date=4 October 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1991, another ''Melody Maker'' journalist watched the KLF deface a billboard advertising ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', doctoring the slogan "[[Gulf War|THE GULF]]: the coverage, the analysis, the facts" by painting a 'K' over the 'GU'. Drummond and Cauty were, on this occasion, caught at the scene by police and arrested, later to be released without charge.&lt;ref name="Stubbs" /&gt;

In November 1991, the slogan "It's Grim Up North" appeared as graffiti on the junction of London's [[M25 motorway|M25]] orbital motorway with the [[M1 motorway|M1]], which runs to Northern England. The graffiti, for which the JAMs denied responsibility, led to a [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] motion being timetabled by [[Member of Parliament]] [[Joseph Ashton (politician)|Joe Ashton]] regarding regional imbalance.&lt;ref&gt;"The JAMs: centre of political interest", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 9 November 1991 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=258 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916114545/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=258 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1997, on the day after Drummond and Cauty's brief remergence as 2K, the graffiti "1997: What The Fuck's Going On?" appeared on the outside wall of London's [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], ten years after the slogan "1987: What The Fuck's Going On?" had been similarly placed to mark the release of the JAMs' debut album.&lt;ref&gt;"Pre-millennium tension hits new high", ''[[New Musical Express]]'' 27 September 1997 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=465 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916120234/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=465 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chill Out'' is cited as "one of the essential ambient albums".&lt;ref&gt;Bush, J., [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r11084|pure_url=yes}} ''Chill Out'' review], [[Allmusic]]. Retrieved 6 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, ''[[Mixmag]]'' named ''Chill Out'' the fifth best "dance" album of all time, describing Cauty's DJ sets with the Orb's Alex Paterson as "seminal".&lt;ref&gt;Philips, D., "50 Greatest Dance Albums: # 5", ''[[Mixmag]]'', March 1996 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=478 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916110651/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=478 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' has credited the KLF with inventing "stadium house"&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, J. "The horny old devils", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 29 August 1997 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=437 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916115808/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=437 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt; and ''NME'' named the KLF's stadium house album ''The White Room'' the 81st best album of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020106061903/http://microsites.nme.com/top100/site/90.html NME TOP 100 ALBUMS OF ALL TIME] at [[NME]], via the Wayback Machine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040815023740/http://microsites.nme.com/reviews/top100.html nme.com - Top 100 Of All Times] at [[NME]], via the Wayback Machine&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sound on Sound]]'' magazine credited the KLF with "set[ting] the trend for a new approach to mixing". Engineer [[Mark Stent]] is quoted as saying:

{{quote|It was in working with Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty that things really started to happen in a new way, using mixing as a work-in-progress, rather than an end stage. We were running everything live in the studio, from [[music sequencer|sequencers]] and samplers. Obviously there was also stuff on tape, but they would come in with their [[Atari ST|Ataris]] and [[Akai]] samplers, and we would end up rearranging the whole song whilst mixing things. They would then take away what we did, work on it again, and come back a while later, and I'd mix stuff again. My KLF work put me in the picture, and after that the phone never stopped ringing.|&lt;ref name="SoS"&gt;[[Mark Stent]], in Tingen, P. "The Work of a Top Flight Mixer", ''[[Sound on Sound]]'' magazine, January 1999 ([http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jan99/articles/spike366.htm link]). Retrieved March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Opinions of contemporaries===
In 1991, [[Chris Lowe]] of the Pet Shop Boys said that he considered the only other worthwhile group in the UK to be the KLF. [[Neil Tennant]] added that "They have an incredibly recognisable sound. I liked it when they said [[EMF (band)|EMF]] nicked the F from KLF.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, R. "One Coronation Under A Groove", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 12 January 1991 ({{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id%3D191 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004150446/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=191 |archivedate=4 October 2016 |df=dmy }})&lt;/ref&gt; They're from a different tradition to us in that they're pranksters and we've never been pranksters."&lt;ref name="psb"/&gt;

At the time of the KLF's retirement announcement, Drummond's old friend and colleague [[David Balfe]] said of Drummond's KLF career that "the path he's trod[den] is a more artistic one than mine. I know that deep down I like the idea of building up a very successful career, where Bill is more interested in weird stuff&amp;nbsp;.... I think the very avoidance of cliché has become their particular cliché".&lt;ref name="select92"/&gt;

In March 1994, members of the anarchist band [[Chumbawamba]] expressed their respect for the KLF. Vocalist and percussionist Alice Nutter referred to the KLF as "real situationists" categorising them as political musicians alongside the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]. Dunst Bruce lauded the K Foundation, concluding "I think the things the KLF do are fantastic. I'm a vegetarian but I wish they'd sawn an elephant's legs off at the BRIT Awards."&lt;ref&gt;[[Stuart Maconie|Maconie, S.]], Chumbawamba interview, ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'', March 1994 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=378 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916114318/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=378 |date=16 September 2016 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct influence===
The KLF have been imitated to some degree by German techno band [[Scooter (band)|Scooter]], being sampled on virtually every album Scooter have released. An outfit called "1300 Drums featuring the Unjustified Ancients of M.U." released a novelty single to cash-in on the popularity of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] footballer [[Eric Cantona]]. 1300 Drums even made a KLF-style ''Top of the Pops'' appearance, with the "band" wearing Cantona masks. The authorship of "Ooh Aah" remains unresolved: at least one source maintains that Drummond and Cauty themselves were 1300 Drums.&lt;ref&gt;RedMuze biography of the KLF at [[BBC Online]] ([http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/artists/k/klf/ link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115183849/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/artists/k/klf/ |date=15 January 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

The Timelords' book, ''[[The Manual]]'', was reportedly used by the one-hit-wonders [[Edelweiss (band)|Edelweiss]] to secure their hit "Bring Me Edelweiss".&lt;ref name="X-not-Bill"&gt;Longmire, E. "KLF Is Going to Rock You" ''X Magazine'', July 1991 ([https://archive.is/20120708094940/http://cardhouse.com/x07/klf.html link])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reighley, K.B. "Hear No Evil", ''[[Seattle Weekly]]'', 26 May 1999 ([http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/9921/two-reighley.php link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303211002/http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/9921/two-reighley.php |date=3 March 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 ''Classic Pop'' magazine featured an article which claimed the KLF were in turn influenced by the Dr Calculus mdma 1986 album ''Designer Beatnik''.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Calculus Vs. The KLF, Classic Pop Magazine, Summer 2014 ([https://www.classicpopmag.com/2014/06/dr-calculus-vs-the-klf/ link])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career retrospectives===
Drummond and Cauty have made frequent appearances in the British [[broadsheet]]s and music papers since the KLF's retirement, most often in connection with the K Foundation and their burning of one million pounds. The ''NME'' described them as "Masters of manipulating media and perceptions of themselves".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nme.com/news/klf/9225 Fresh JAMMS?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115183849/http://www.nme.com/news/klf/9225 |date=15 January 2016 }}", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 6 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, ''NME'' referred to the KLF as "Britain's greatest pop group" and "the two most brilliant minds in pop today",&lt;ref name="sheep-seats"/&gt; and in 2002 listed the duo in their "Top 50 Icons" at number 48.&lt;ref&gt;"Top 50 NME Icons", ''[[New Musical Express]]''. See also "Roll over, Beatles - Smiths top the pops: Oldies and goldies in hall of fame", ''[[The Guardian]]'' ([[Manchester]]), 17 April 2002, "Guardian Home Pages" section, p6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- 404: ([http://microsites.nme.com/nme50/index.html link])--&gt; The British music paper also listed the KLF's 1992 BRIT Awards appearance at number 4 in their "top 100 rock moments of all time".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nme.com/news/kurt-cobain/6010 "Top 100 Rock Moments of All Time"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181059/http://www.nme.com/news/kurt-cobain/6010 |date=3 March 2016 }}, NME.com. Retrieved 3 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; "What's unique about Drummond and Cauty", the paper said in 1993, "is the way that, under all the slogans and the sampling and the smart hits and the dead sheep and the costumes, they appear not only to care, but to have some idea of how to achieve what they want."&lt;ref name="TateTat"/&gt;

"[Of their many aliases,] it is as the KLF that they will go down in pop history," wrote Alix Sharkey in 1994, "for a variety of reasons, the most important being the resolute purity of their self-abnegation, and their visionary understanding of pop." He added: "By early 1992 the KLF was easily the best-selling, probably the most innovative, and undoubtedly the most exhilarating pop phenomenon in Britain. In five years it had gone from pressing up 500 copies of its debut recording to being one of the world's top singles acts." The same piece also quoted Sheryl Garratt, editor of ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'': ""the music hasn't dated. I still get an adrenaline rush listening to it."

''[[Trouser Press]]'' reviewer Ira Robbins referred to the KLF's body of work as "a series of colorful sonic marketing experiments".&lt;ref name="Trouserpress"/&gt; ''The Face'' called them "the kings of cultural anarchy".&lt;ref&gt;"K Foundation: Nailed To The Wall", ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'', January 1994 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=374 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916112429/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=374 |date=16 September 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, ''[[The Observer]]'' named the KLF's departure from the music business (and the BRITs performance in which the newspaper says "their legend was sealed") the fifth greatest "publicity stunt" in the history of popular music ([[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] joining the army being hailed as the greatest).&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, B.

Early releases by the JAMs, including the album ''1987'', were performed using an [[Apple II series|Apple II]] computer with a Greengate DS3 sampler [[Apple II peripheral cards|peripheral card]], and a [[Roland TR-808]] drum machine.&lt;ref&gt;KLF Communications, sleevenotes, "1987: The JAMs 45 Edits", JAMS 23T, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''NME''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s 28 November 1987 review of The JAMs' single "[[Down Town]]" referred to them as "The Kings of The Greengate Sampler".&lt;/ref&gt; On later releases, the Greengate DS3 and Apple II were replaced with an [[Akai|Akai S900]] sampler and [[Atari ST]] computers respectively.&lt;ref name="SoS" /&gt; The house music of [[Space (Jimmy Cauty album)|Space]]&lt;!--this should not be italicised, the prose is referring to artist, not album--&gt; and the KLF involved much original instrumentation, for which the [[Oberheim OB-8]] analogue synthesiser was prominently used.&lt;ref name="LP6"&gt;KLF Communications, sleevenotes, ''[[The White Room]]'', JAMS LP6, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The KLF's 1990–1992 singles were [[record producer|mixed]] by [[Mark Stent]], using a [[Solid State Logic]] automated mixing desk, and ''The White Room'' LP mixed by J. Gordon-Hastings using an analogue desk. The SSL is referenced in the subtitle of the KLF single "3 a.m. Eternal (Live at the S.S.L.)". The [[Roland TB-303]] bassline and [[Roland TR-909]] drum machine feature on "What Time Is Love (Live at Trancentral)".&lt;ref name="LP6" /&gt;

Several of Drummond and Cauty's compositions feature original instrumentation. Drummond played a [[Gibson ES-330]] semi-acoustic guitar on "America: What Time Is Love?",&lt;ref name="USA4"&gt;KLF Communications, sleevenotes, "America: What Time Is Love?", KLF USA4, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cauty played [[electric guitar]] on "Justified &amp; Ancient (Stand by The JAMs)" and "America: What Time Is Love?". [[Graham Lee (Australian musician)|Graham Lee]] provided prominent [[pedal steel guitar|pedal steel]] contributions to the KLF's ''[[Chill Out]]'' and "Build a Fire". Duy Khiem played [[clarinet]] on "3 a.m. Eternal" and "Make It Rain".&lt;ref name="LP6" /&gt; The KLF track "America No More" features a [[pipe band]].&lt;ref name="USA4" /&gt;

[[File:A_Tree_of_twenty_vices_and_twenty_virtues_Wellcome_L0029368.jpg|thumb|Ink and Watercolour Circa 1420-30.]]
A '''tree of virtues''' (''arbor virtutum'') is a diagram used in [[medieval Christianity|medieval Christian]] tradition to display  the relationships between [[virtue]]s, usually juxtaposed with a '''tree of vices''' (''arbor vitiorum'') where the [[vice]]s are treated in a parallel fashion.
Together with  [[genealogical tree]]s,&lt;!--even earlier? genealogical trees certainly from the 14th century, e.g. File:Cod Crem 243 img01.jpg -- but these trees possibly from the 12th?--&gt; 
these diagrams qualify as among the earliest explicit [[tree structure|tree-diagrams]] in history, emerging in the [[High Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;genealogical stemmata since at least the 11th century, the ''arbor virtutum'' since at least the 12th; see Nora Gädeke, ''Zeugnisse Bildlicher Darstellung Der Nachkommenschaft Heinrichs I'',  Arbeiten zur Frühmittelalterforschung 22 (1992), p. 2. For the possibility of a genealogiacal stemma of the early 10th century, see Nora Gädeke, ''Eine Karolingergenealogie des frühen 10. Jahrhunderts?'', Francia 15 (1987), [http://francia.digitale-sammlungen.de/Blatt_bsb00016291,00793.html 778-792]&lt;/ref&gt;

At first appearing as illustrations in certain theological tracts, the concept becomes more popular in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and is also seen in courtly manuscripts such as the psalter of Robert de Lisle (c. 1310-1340).

The nodes of the tree-diagrams are the [[Cardinal Virtues]] and the [[Cardinal Vices]], respectively, each with a number of secondary virtues or secondary vices shown as leaves of the respective nodes.
While on a tree of virtues, the leaves point upward toward heaven, on a tree of vices the leaves point downward toward hell.
At the root of the trees, the virtues of ''humilitas'' "humility" and the vice of ''superbia'' "pride" is shown as the origin of all other virtues and vices, respectively. 
By this time, the concept of showing hierarchical concepts of medieval philosophy in diagrams also becomes more widespread. E.g. ms. [[Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal|Arsenal]] 1037 (14th century)  has a tree of virtue on [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b52500993t/f18.image fol. 4v] and a tree of vices on [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b52500993t/f19.image fol. 5r] as part of a collection of diagrams on a variety of topics.&lt;ref&gt;''Septem hore canonice; Septem actus passionis Christi; Septem dona gratuita; Arbor virtutum; Arbor vicioru; Arbor sapientie; Duodecim prophete; Duodecim articuli fidei; Duodecim apostoli.''&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, the trees are also further subdivided into a ternary structure, as follows:
*''[[humilitas]] radix virtutum''
**I. ''[[prudentia]]'' (seven sub-virtues)
**II. ''[[wikt:fortitudo|fortitudo]]'' (seven sub-virtues)
**''semita vitalis''
***III. ''[[Justice (virtue)|iustitia]]'' (seven sub-virtues)
***IIII. ''[[temperantia]]'' (seven sub-virtues)
***''fructus spiritus''
****V. ''[[Faith|fides]]'' (seven sub-virtues)
****VI. ''[[spes]]'' (seven sub-virtues)
****VII. ''[[Charity (virtue)|caritas]]'' (seven sub-virtues)
*''[[Pride|superbia]] radix vitiorum''
**I. ''[[avaritia]]'' (seven sub-vices)
**II. ''[[invidia]]'' (seven sub-vices)
**''semita mortis''
***III. ''[[vanagloria|inanis gloria]]'' (seven sub-vices)
***IIII. ''[[wrath|ira]]'' (seven sub-vices)
***''fructus carnis''
****V. ''[[gluttony|gula]]'' (seven sub-vices)
****VI. ''[[acedia]]'' (seven sub-vices)
****VII. ''[[luxuria (vice)|luxuria]]'' (seven sub-vices)

In the [[Italian Renaissance]], [[Pietro Bembo]] developed a similar flow-chart-like "moral schema" of sins punished in [[Divine Comedy|Dante]]'s ''Inferno'' and ''Purgatory''.&lt;ref&gt;

In [[information visualization]] and [[computing]], '''treemapping''' is a method for displaying [[hierarchical]] data using [[Nesting (computing)|nested]] figures, usually rectangles.

== Main idea ==
Treemaps display hierarchical ([[Tree (data structure)|tree-structured]]) data as a set of nested rectangles. Each branch of the tree is given a rectangle, which is then tiled with smaller rectangles representing sub-branches. A leaf node's rectangle has an area proportional to a specified [[Dimension (metadata)|dimension of the data]]. Often the leaf nodes are colored to show a separate dimension of the data.

When the color and size dimensions are correlated in some way with the tree structure, one can often easily see patterns that would be difficult to spot in other ways, such as if a certain color is particularly relevant. A second advantage of treemaps is that, by construction, they make efficient use of space. As a result, they can legibly display thousands of items on the screen simultaneously.

== Tiling algorithms ==
To create a treemap, one must define a [[tessellation|tiling]] [[algorithm]], that is, a way to divide a region into sub-regions of specified areas. Ideally, a treemap algorithm would create regions that satisfy the following criteria:
# A small [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]—ideally close to one. Regions with a small aspect ratio (i.e, [[fat object]]s) are easier to perceive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/TVCG.2010.186|pmid=20975136|title=Perceptual Guidelines for Creating Rectangular Treemaps|journal=IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics|volume=16|issue=6|pages=990|year=2010|last1=Kong|first1=N|last2=Heer|first2=J|last3=Agrawala|first3=M}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Preserve some sense of the ordering in the input data.
# Change to reflect changes in the underlying data. 
Unfortunately, these properties have an inverse relationship. As the aspect ratio is optimized, the order of placement becomes less predictable. As the order becomes more stable, the aspect ratio is degraded.{{Example needed}}

== Convex treemaps ==
Rectangular treemaps have the disadvantage that their aspect ratio might be arbitrarily high in the worst case. As a simple example, if the tree root has only two children, one with weight &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt; and one with weight &lt;math&gt;1-1/n&lt;/math&gt;, then the aspect ratio of the smaller child will be &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, which can be arbitrarily high. 
To cope with this problem, several algorithms have been proposed that use regions that are general [[convex polygon]]s, not necessarily rectangular.

'''Convex treemaps''' were developed in several steps, each step improved the upper bound on the aspect ratio. The bounds are given as a function of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; - the total number of nodes in the tree, and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; - the total depth of the tree.

1. Onak and Sidiropoulos&lt;ref name="convex_algorithm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.csail.mit.edu/konak/papers/socg_2008-circular_partitions_with_applications_to_visualization_and_embeddings.html |title= Circular Partitions with Applications to Visualization and Embeddings |author=Krzysztof Onak |author2=Anastasios Sidiropoulos  |accessdate=June 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved an upper bound of &lt;math&gt;O((d\log{n})^{17})&lt;/math&gt;.

2. De-Berg and Onak and Sidiropoulos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1009.1866|author1=Mark de Berg|title=Fat Polygonal Partitions with Applications to Visualization and Embeddings| last2=Onak| first2=Krzysztof| last3=Sidiropoulos| first3=Anastasios| class=cs.CG| year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; improve the upper bound to &lt;math&gt;O(d+\log{n})&lt;/math&gt;, and prove a lower bound of &lt;math&gt;\Omega(d)&lt;/math&gt;.

3. De-Berg and Speckmann and van-der-Weele&lt;ref name="dsv2"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.comgeo.2013.12.008|arxiv=1012.1749|title=Treemaps with bounded aspect ratio|journal=Computational Geometry|volume=47|issue=6|pages=683|year=2014|last1=De Berg|first1=Mark|last2=Speckmann|first2=Bettina|author2-link=Bettina Speckmann|last3=Van Der Weele|first3=Vincent}}. Conference version: {{cite conference|url=http://alexandria.tue.nl/openaccess/Metis253577.pdf|title=Convex Treemaps with Bounded Aspect Ratio|conference=EuroCG|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; improve the upper bound to &lt;math&gt;O(d)&lt;/math&gt;, matching the theoretical lower bound. 
* For the special case where the depth is 1, they present an algorithm that uses only four classes of 45-degree-polygons (rectangles, right-angled triangles, right-angled trapezoids and 45-degree pentagons), and guarantees an aspect ratio of at most 34/7.

The latter two algorithms operate in two steps (greatly simplified for clarity):
* A. The original tree is converted to a binary tree: each node with more than two children is replaced by a sub-tree in which each node has exactly two children.
* B. Each region representing a node (starting from the root) is divided to two, using a line that keeps the angles between edges as large as possible. It is possible to prove that, if all edges of a convex polygon are separated by an angle of at least &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, then its aspect ratio is &lt;math&gt;O(1/\phi)&lt;/math&gt;. It is possible to ensure that, in a tree of depth &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, the angle is divided by a factor of at most &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, hence the aspect ratio guarantee.

=== Orthoconvex treemaps ===
In convex treemaps, the aspect ratio cannot be constant - it grows with the depth of the tree. 
To attain a constant aspect-ratio,  '''Orthoconvex treemaps'''&lt;ref name="dsv2"/&gt; can be used. There, all regions are [[orthoconvex]] [[rectilinear polygon]]s with aspect ratio at most 64; and the leaves are either rectangles with aspect ratio at most 8, or L-shapes or S-shapes with aspect ratio at most 32.

== History ==
Area-based visualizations have existed for decades. For example, [[mosaic plot]]s (also known as Marimekko diagrams) use rectangular tilings to show joint distributions (i.e., most commonly they are essentially stacked column plots where the columns are of different widths). The main distinguishing feature of a treemap, however, is the recursive construction that allows it to be extended to hierarchical data with any number of levels. This idea was invented by professor [[Ben Shneiderman]] at the [[University of Maryland Human – Computer Interaction Lab]] in the early 1990s.
&lt;ref name=shneiderman_0&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1145/102377.115768|title=Tree visualization with tree-maps: 2-d space-filling approach|journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics|volume=11|pages=92|year=1992|last1=Shneiderman|first1=Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shneiderman_1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/treemap-history/index.shtml |title=Treemaps for space-constrained visualization of hierarchies ~ Including the History of Treemap Research at the University of Maryland|author=[[Ben Shneiderman]] |author2=[[Catherine Plaisant]] |date=June 25, 2009 |accessdate=February 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shneiderman and his collaborators then deepened the idea by introducing a variety of interactive techniques for filtering and adjusting treemaps.

These early treemaps all used the simple "slice-and-dice" tiling algorithm. Despite many desirable properties (it is stable, preserves ordering, and is easy to implement), the slice-and-dice method often produces tilings with many long, skinny rectangles. In 1994 Mountaz Hascoet &amp; [[Michel Beaudouin-Lafon]] invented a "squarifying" algorithm, later popularized by [[Jarke van Wijk]], that created tilings whose rectangles were closer to square. In 1999 [[Martin M. Wattenberg|Martin Wattenberg]] used a variation of the "squarifying" algorithm that he called "pivot and slice" to create the first Web-based treemap, the SmartMoney Map of the Market, which displayed data on hundreds of companies in the U.S. stock market. Following its launch, treemaps enjoyed a surge of interest, especially in financial contexts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

A third wave of treemap innovation came around 2004, after [[Marcos Weskamp]] created the [[Newsmap]], a treemap that displayed news headlines. This example of a non-analytical treemap inspired many imitators, and introduced treemaps to a new, broad audience.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} In recent years, treemaps have made their way into the mainstream media, including usage by the New York Times.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2007/02/25/business/20070225_CHRYSLER_GRAPHIC.html|title=The health of the car, van, SUV, and truck market|date=February 25, 2007|accessdate=March 12, 2010 | work=The New York Times | first1=Amanda | last1=Cox | first2=Hannah | last2=Fairfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/newsgraphics/2011/0119-budget/index.html?hp|title=Obama's 2012 Budget Proposal: How $3.7 Trillion is Spent |date=February 14, 2011|accessdate=February 15, 2011 | work=The New York Times | first1=Shan | last1=Carter | first2=Amanda | last2=Cox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5894">'''Truthmaker theory''' is "the branch of metaphysics that explores the relationships between what is true and what exists."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/truth-ma/ Truthmaker Theory – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''truthmaker''' for a [[truthbearer]] is that entity in virtue of which the truthbearer is true. Philosophers have speculated on the question whether every truthbearer requires a truthmaker.  [[Parmenides]]' classic claim that what does not exist cannot be thought about has been read as a claim that every truthbearer must have a truthmaker, since otherwise the truthbearer is not ''about'' anything. A '''falsemaker''' for a [[proposition]] is that existent reality in virtue of which that proposition is false, assuming it is false.

==Overview==
In "Truth-Makers" (1984), Mulligan, Simons and Smith introduced the truth-maker idea as a contribution to the correspondence theory of truth. Logically atomic empirical sentences such as "John kissed Mary" have truthmakers, typically events or tropes corresponding to the main verbs of the sentences in question. Mulligan et al. explore extensions of this idea to sentences of other sorts, but they do not embrace any position of truthmaker maximalism, according to which every truthbearer has a truthmaker.

This maximalist position leads to philosophical difficulties, such as the question of what the truthmaker for an [[ethics|ethical]], [[modal logic|modal]] or [[mathematics|mathematical]] truthbearer could be. Of course someone who is deeply enough committed to truthmakers and who simultaneously doubts that a truthmaker could be found for a certain kind of truthbearer will simply deny that that truthbearer could be true. Those who find the Parmenidean insight sufficiently compelling often take it to be a particularly enlightening metaphysical pursuit to search for truthmakers of these kinds of propositions.

Another difficulty for the claim that every truthbearer has a truthmaker is with negations of [[existential proposition]]s (or, equivalently, [[universal proposition]]s). What ''entity'' makes it true that unicorns do not exist?  Proposals include the ''totality'' of all things, or some worldly state of affairs such as x1's not being a unicorn, x2's not being a unicorn, ..., and everything's being x1, or x2, or ... (the latter suggestion is due to Richard M. Gale).  

[[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] has proposed a more moderate version of the truthmaker theory on which truthmakers are only required for positive propositions (e.g., there must be a truthmaker for the proposition that there are horses, but not for the equally true proposition that there are no unicorns). What makes a negative proposition ''p'' true is the ''lack'' of a [[falsemaker]] for it, i.e., the lack of a truthmaker for the negation of ''p''. Thus what makes it true that there are no unicorns is the lack of a truthmaker for the proposition that there ''are'' unicorns, i.e., the lack of unicorns. This may be what Protagoras was getting at when he said that to speak truly is to say of what is that it is and of what is not that it is not.

Truthmaker theorists differ as to what entities are the truthmakers of various truthbearers. Some say that the truthmaker of the proposition that Socrates is sitting (assuming he is!) is ''Socrates' being seated'' (whatever exactly that might turn out to be on the correct ontology) and in general the truthmaker of the truthbearer expressed by a sentence ''s'' can be denoted by the [[participial nominalization]] of ''s''. Others will say that the truthmaker of the proposition that Socrates is sitting is just ''Socrates'' himself. In any case, the truthmaker is supposed to be something ''concrete'', and on the first view is that whose existence is reported by the truthbearer and on the second view is that which the truthbearer is ''about''.

While the existence of truthmakers may seem an abstruse question, concrete instances are at the heart of a number of philosophical issues. Thus, J. L. Mackie has argued that the truthmakers of moral claims would be "queer entities", too strange to exist, and hence all moral claims are false. Alternatively, a [[Divine command theory|divine command]] [[metaethics|metaethicist]] may insist that the only possible candidate for a truthmaker of a moral claim is a command from a perfect God, and hence if moral claims are true and a truthmaker theory holds, then God exists. Thus the disagreement between various [[metaethics|metaethical]] schools is in part a disagreement over what kinds of truthmakers moral claims would have if these claims were true and over whether such truthmakers exist.

'''''Unequal crossing over''''' is a type of gene duplication or deletion event that deletes a sequence in one strand and replaces it with a duplication from its sister [[chromatid]] in [[mitosis]] or from its homologous chromosome during [[meiosis]].  It is a type of [[chromosomal crossover]] between homologous sequences that are not paired precisely. Normally genes are responsible for occurrence of crossing over. It exchanges sequences of different links between chromosomes.  Along with [[gene conversion]], it is believed to be the main  driver for the generation of [[gene duplication]]s and is a source of mutation in the genome.&lt;ref name="Dan"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Molecular Evolution |edition=Second |last1=Graur |first1=Dan |last2=Li |first2=Wen-Hsiung |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc. |location=Sunderland, Massachusetts |isbn=0878932666 |url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Fundamentals_of_Molecular_Evolution.html?id=Bf5-QgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==
During [[meiosis]], the duplicated chromosomes ([[chromatids]]) in eukaryotic organisms are attached to each other in the [[centromere]] region and are thus paired. The maternal and paternal chromosomes then align alongside each other.  During this time, recombination can take place via crossing over of sections of the paternal and maternal chromatids and leads to reciprocal recombination or non-reciprocal recombination.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  Unequal crossing over requires a measure of similarity between the sequences for misalignment to occur.  The more similarity within the sequences, the more likely unequal crossing over will occur.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  One of the sequences is thus lost and replaced with the duplication of another sequence.

When two sequences are misaligned, unequal crossing over may create a tandem repeat on one chromosome and a deletion on the other.  The rate of unequal crossing over will increase with the number of repeated sequences around the duplication.  This is because these repeated sequences will pair together, allowing for the mismatch in the cross over point to occur.&lt;ref name=russell&gt;{{cite book |title=iGenetics |last=Russel |first=Peter J. |date=2002 |publisher=[[Benjamin Cummings]] |location=San Francisco |isbn=0-8053-4553-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences for the organism==
Unequal crossing over is the process most responsible for creating regional gene duplications in the genome.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  Repeated rounds of unequal crossing over cause the homogenization of the two sequences.  With the increase in the duplicates, unequal crossing over can lead to dosage imbalance in the genome and can be highly deleterious.&lt;ref name=Dan /&gt;&lt;ref name=russell /&gt;

==Evolutionary implications==
In unequal crossing over, there can be large sequence exchanges between the chromosomes.  Compared with gene conversion, which can only transfer a maximum of 1,500 base pairs, unequal crossing over in yeast rDNA genes has been found to transfer about 20,000 base pairs in a single crossover event&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="szostak1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Szostak |first1=J. W. |last2=Wu |first2=R. |title=Unequal crossing over in the ribosomal DNA of ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae''| doi = 10.1038/284426a0 |journal=Nature |volume=284 |pages=426–430 |date=1980 |issue=5755|bibcode=1980Natur.284..426S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unequal crossover can be followed by the [[concerted evolution]] of  duplicated sequences.

It has been suggested that longer intron found between two beta-globin genes are a response to deleterious selection from unequal crossing over in the beta-globin genes.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zimmer1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zimmer |first1=E. A. |last2=Martin |first2=S. M. |last3=Beverley |first3=S. M. |last4=Kan |first4=Y. W. |last5=Wilson |first5=A. C. |title=Rapid duplication and loss of genes coding for the alpha chains of hemoglobin |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA |volume=77 |pages=2158–2162 |date=1980 | pmc=348671 | doi =10.1073/pnas.77.4.2158 |pmid=6929543|bibcode=1980PNAS...77.2158Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Comparisons between alpha-globin, which does not have long introns, and beta-globin genes show that alpha-globin have 50 times higher concerted evolution.

When unequal crossing over creates a [[gene duplication]], the duplicate has 4 [[evolution]]ary fates. This is due to the fact that [[purifying selection]] acting on a duplicated copy is not very strong.  Now that there is a redundant copy, [[neutral mutation]]s can act on the duplicate.  Most commonly the neutral mutations will continue until the duplicate becomes a [[pseudogene]].  If the duplicate copy increases the dosage effect of the gene product, then the duplicate may be retained as a redundant copy.  [[Neofunctionalization]] is also a possibility: the duplicated copy acquires a mutation that gives it a different function than its ancestor.  If both copies acquire mutations, it is possible that a [[subfunctionalization|subfunctional event]] occurs.  This happens when both of the duplicated sequences have a more specialized function than the ancestral copy&lt;ref name=force1999&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Force |first1=Allan |last2=Lynch |first2=Michael |last3=Pickettb |first3=F. Bryan |last4=Amoresa |first4=Angel |last5=Yana |first5=Yi-lin  |last6=Postlethwaita |first6=John |date=1999 |title=Preservation of Duplicate Genes by Complementary, Degenerative Mutations |journal=Genetics |volume=151 |pages=1531–1545|pmid=10101175 |pmc=1460548 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genome size===
Gene duplications are the main reason for the increase of genome size, and as unequal crossing over is the main mechanism for gene duplication, unequal crossing over contributes to genome size evolution is the most common regional duplication event that increases the size of the genome.

====Junk DNA====
When viewing the genome of a eukaryote, a striking observation is the large amount of tandem, repetitive DNA sequences that make up a large portion of the genome.  For example, over 50% of the ''Dipodmys ordii'' genome is made up of three specific repeats. ''Drosophila virilis'' has three sequences that make up 40% of the genome, and 35% of the ''Absidia glauca'' is repetitive DNA sequences.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  These short sequences have no selection pressure acting on them and the frequency of the repeats can be changed by unequal crossing over.&lt;ref name="zhang2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=J. |title=Evolution of the human ASPM gene, a major determinant of brain size |journal=Genetics |volume=165 |pages=2063–2070 |date=2003 | pmid = 14704186 |issue=4 |pmc=1462882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CanadaStatueTruth crop.jpg|thumb|Statue of Veritas outside the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]]]

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Veritas''', meaning ''truth'', is the [[goddess]] of [[truth]], a daughter of Chronos, the God of Time (who has been identified with [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn-Cronus]], perhaps first by Plutarch), and the mother of [[Virtus (deity)|Virtus]]. She is also sometimes considered the daughter of [[Zeus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]] ''Olympian Ode 10'': But come, Muse, you and the daughter of Zeus, unforgettable Truth: with the hand that puts things right, keep from me the blame for lying, for wronging my friend. Approaching from far away, the future has arrived and made me ashamed of my deep debt. Still, payment with interest has a way of dissolving the bitter reproach of men.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DO.%3Apoem%3D10]&lt;/ref&gt; or a creation of [[Prometheus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aesop]] ''[[Aesop's Fables|Fables]]'' 530 (from [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]] Appendix 5): [[Prometheus]], that potter who gave shape to our new generation, decided one day to sculpt a statue of Truth, using all his skill so that she would be able to regulate people's behaviour. As he was working, an unexpected summons from mighty Jupiter called him away. Prometheus left cunning Trickery in charge of his workshop (Trickery had recently become one of the god's apprentices). Fired by ambition, Trickery used the time at his disposal to fashion with his sly fingers a figure of the same size and appearance as Truth with identical features. When he had almost completed the piece, which was truly remarkable, he ran out of clay to use for her feet. The master returned, so Trickery quickly sat down in his seat, quaking with fear. Prometheus was amazed at the similarity of the two statues and wanted it to seem as if all the credit were due to his own skill. Therefore, he put both statues in the kiln and when they had been thoroughly baked, he infused them both with life: sacred Truth walked with measured steps, while her unfinished twin stood stuck in her tracks.

Veritas is also the name given to the [[Roman virtue]] of [[Honesty|truthfulness]], which was considered one of the main virtues any good Roman should possess. The Greek goddess of truth is [[Aletheia]] ([[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀλήθεια}}). The German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] argues that the truth represented by ''aletheia'' (which essentially means "unconcealment") is different from that represented by ''veritas'', which is linked to a Roman understanding of rightness and finally to a Nietzschean sense of justice and a will to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=B.

In [[Western culture]], the word may also serve as a [[motto]].

==Mottos==
This [[Latin]] word "''veritas''" now appears in the [[motto]]s of many [[college]]s and [[university|universities]]. It is typically capitalized in mottoes (as "''Veritas''") for being an ideal (such as: Truth, Kindness and Beauty).  ''Veritas'' is the motto of [[Hutchesons' Grammar School]], [[Harvard University]], [[The University of Western Ontario]], [[Drake University]], [[Knox College (Illinois)]], [[Bilkent University]], the University of California - Hastings College of the Law, as well as the [[Dominican Order]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and [[Providence College]] and [[Molloy College]] which is run by the Dominicans. Additionally, the word appears in mottoes that are phrases, or lists e.g. the [[Buckley School (New York City)|Buckley School]] of the [[New York City|City of New York]] employs the phrase ''Honor et Veritas'', the [[University of Indonesia]]'s motto is "Veritas, Probitas, Iustitia", the [[University of Cape Coast]] in [[Ghana]]'s motto is "Veritas Nobis Lumen", the [[University of Michigan]]'s motto is: "Artes, Scientia, Veritas". [[Doshisha University]] in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]'s motto is "[[Veritas vos liberabit|Veritas Liberabit Vos]]".

[[Caldwell College]] in [[Caldwell, New Jersey]] issues a "Veritas Award" each year in honor of the [[Dominican Sisters]] who founded and administer the college. "Veritas" is included in the motto of [[Indiana University]] and [[Yale University]], ''Lux et Veritas'' ("Light and Truth"). It also appears on the [[California State University]]'s motto ''Vox Veritas Vita'' ("Speak the Truth as a way of Life"). "[[Veritas vos liberabit]]" ("The Truth Will Set You Free") is the motto of The [[Johns Hopkins University]]. ''Veritas Curat'' ("Truth Cures") is the motto of the [[JIPMER|Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research]], a medical school in [[Puducherry]], [[India]]. [[Howard University]], in [[Washington, D.C.]], goes by the motto "Veritas et Utilitas", translated to "Truth and Service", which is also a motto "Truth-Service" of [[Payap University]], [[Thailand]]. It also exists in the logo of [[Seoul National University]], Korea: "Veritas Lux Mea" &amp;ndash; meaning "Truth is my light". [[Villanova University]] also uses Veritas in its school motto, ''Veritas, Unitas, Caritas'' ("Truth, Unity, Love"). [[Uppsala University]] in Sweden also uses Veritas in its school motto, "Gratiae veritas naturae".

The [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]], the U.S. Navy's primary counterintelligence arm and law enforcement agency, uses the motto on its official seal.

'''Workplace violence''' (WPV) or '''occupational violence''' refers to [[violence]], usually in the form of [[physical abuse]] or [[threat]], that creates a risk to the health and [[safety]] of an [[employee]] or multiple employees.&lt;ref name = Worksafe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au/safety-and-prevention/health-and-safety-topics/occupational-violence |title=Occupational Violence | publisher= WorkSafe| accessdate= January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
According to data from the US [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], in 2011 violence and other injuries caused by persons or animals contributed to 17% of all US occupational fatalities, with homicides contributing to 10% of the total.&lt;ref name = BLS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfch0010.pdf |title=Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries, 2011| publisher= US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics| accessdate= January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1992 to 2010, there were 13,827 reported workplace homicide victims, averaging over 700 victims per year, in the United States.&lt;ref name = OccViolence&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/violence/ |title=CDC - Occupational Violence - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic| publisher= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health| accessdate= January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examination of the 2011 data shows that while a majority of workplace fatalities occurred to males, workplace violence disproportionately affects females. Homicides contributed to 21% of all occupational fatalities for women, compared to 9% for men.&lt;ref name = BLS/&gt; Of these homicides, relatives or domestic partners contributed to 39% of female homicide cases; male homicide cases were most likely to be perpetrated by robbers, contributing to 36% of male homicide cases.&lt;ref name = BLS/&gt;

The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] ("OSHA") a department of the United States Department of Labor defines workplace violence as "any act or threat of physical violence, harassment, intimidation, or other threatening disruptive behavior that occurs at the work site.  It ranges from threats and verbal abuse to physical assaults and even homicide." &lt;ref name="SLTC"&gt;Source: https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/workplaceviolence/&lt;/ref&gt;

2,000,000 US workers per year report workplace violence&lt;ref name="SLTC"/&gt;

Most cases of workplace violence are non-fatal. From 1993 to 1999, an average of about 1.7 million people reported occupational violence.&lt;ref name = OccViolence/&gt; About 75% of these cases are considered simple assault, while 19% of cases are considered aggravated assault.&lt;ref name = OccViolence/&gt;

Workplace violence is at epidemic proportions. "There used to be a time when an employee shooting someone in the workplace would be a shock. Now it’s becoming common.” states [[Kathleen M. Bonczyk]], Esq. a researcher and expert on workplace violence prevention.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/work-grave-danger-article-1.3279671&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a June 2017 shooting spree when a former employee returned to his Orlando, Florida workplace to murder five co-workers before committing suicide Kathleen M. Bonczyk, Esq. stated “You hear it again and again. People always say ‘We didn’t think it (workplace violence) would happen here,’ but it can happen anywhere and anytime. It shouldn’t be a question of if; employers should operate under the question of when.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/orlando-workplace-shooting/os-orlando-workplace-shooting-violence-uptick-20170605-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

* Patrick Henry Sherrill, a 44-year-old [[mail carrier]] from [[Edmond, Oklahoma]], was reprimanded after a heated argument with two supervisors on August 19, 1986. At approximately 7:00 the following morning, Sherrill showed up at the post office in his uniform. Over the course of the next 15 minutes, Sherrill went on [[Edmond post office shooting|a murderous rampage]], gunning down any employee who crossed his path. After sealing off the exits, Sherrill ended up murdering fourteen coworkers and wounding six others. When police arrived at the post office, Sherrill turned the gun on himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,144859,00.html | work=Time | first=Jacob V. | last=Lamar Jr | title="Crazy Pat's" Revenge | date=June 24, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* David Burke was employed by [[USAir]] as a ticket agent until his supervisor, Raymond Thompson, fired him for theft. After Thompson refused to reinstate him, Burke showed up at [[Los Angeles International Airport]] on December 7, 1987, and purchased a ticket for [[Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771]] to [[San Francisco International Airport]]. Burke smuggled a [[.44 Magnum]] onto the aircraft. Shortly after takeoff, the aircraft's [[flight recorder|cockpit voice recorder]] picked up the sound of gunshots. Then came the sound of David Burke’s voice. The pilots were shot and the aircraft crashed into a hillside in [[San Luis Obispo County]], killing all 43 people on board, including Burke and Thompson. At the crash site, an airsickness bag was found containing a message which Burke had written for his former supervisor. It read: “I asked for some leniency for my family, remember. Well, I got none.

Flanagan, who had been previously terminated from his position at WDBJ, captured the three via a body cam and appeared to wait until the piece was airing before he began shooting and emptied his Glock handgun of all bullets. Gardener who was also shot survived the attack. After the shootings, Flanagan fled the scene and later boasted about the attack on social media before he was killed by police.&lt;ref name="propertycasualty360.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.propertycasualty360.com/2016/04/22/three-keys-to-reducing-workplace-violence-risks|title=Three keys to reducing workplace violence risks|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst other things, Stair posted numerous images of himself with his shotguns.  He went so far as to name them "the twins" and is even seen caressing and kissing one.  In one of his videos Stair proclaims “All souls are fair game.” Stair who idolized the Columbine killers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.

* On April 3, 2018, Nasim Najafi Aghdam opened fire on her co-workers at Youtube headquarters in San Bruno, California, killing herself and sending 3 others to the hospital. Police describe it as workplace violence.

==Aggression==
Dr. [[Arnold H. Buss]], of the University of Texas at Austin (1961),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buss |first=AH |year=1961 |title=The Psychology of Aggression}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified eight types of [[workplace aggression]]:
*Verbal-passive-indirect (failure to deny false rumors about target, failure to provide information needed by target)&lt;ref name="propertycasualty360.com"/&gt;
*Verbal-passive-direct ("[[silent treatment]]", failure to return communication, i.e. phone calls, e-mails)
*Verbal-active-indirect (spreading [[False accusation|false rumors]], belittling ideas or work)
*Verbal-active-direct (insulting, acting condescendingly, yelling)
*Physical-passive-indirect (causing others to create a delay for the target)
*Physical-passive-direct (reducing target's ability to contribute, e.g. scheduling them to present at the end of the day where fewer people will be attending)
*Physical-active-indirect (theft, destruction of property, unnecessary consumption of resources needed by the target)
*Physical-active-direct (physical attack, nonverbal, vulgar gestures directed at the target)

In a study performed by Baron and Neuman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baron|first1=RA|last2=Neuman|first2=HA|title=Workplace violence and workplace aggression: Evidence on their relative frequency and potential causes|journal=Aggressive Behavior|volume=22|pages=161–173|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2337(1996)22:3&lt;161::AID-AB1&gt;3.0.CO;2-Q}}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers found pay cuts and pay freezes, use of part-time employees, change in management, increased diversity, computer monitoring of employee performance, reengineering, and budget cuts were all significantly linked to increased workplace aggression.  The study also showed a substantial amount of evidence linking unpleasant physical conditions (high temperature, poor lighting) and high negative affect, which facilitates workplace aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Risk assessments===
{{globalize|date=September 2009}}
In the United Kingdom there is a legal obligation to complete risk assessments for both physical and psychosocial workplace hazards. Other countries have similar occupational health and safety legislation in place relating to identifying and either eliminating or controlling for hazards in the workplace. Workplace violence is considered to be a significant hazard in its own right. Regulation 3 of the ''Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations'' 1999 states that, “every employer shall make a suitable and sufficient assessment of:
* The risks to the health and safety of his (or her) employees to which they are exposed whilst they are at work; and
* The risks to the health and safety of persons not in his employment arising out of or in connection with the conduct of him or his undertaking".

==Occupational groups at higher risk==
The Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety lists the following higher risk occupations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
| title = Violence in the Workplace
| url = http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/psychosocial/violence.html#_1_3
| accessdate = May 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Healthcare workers
* Correctional officers
* Social Services workers
* Teachers
* Municipal housing inspectors
* Public Works Employees
* Retail Workers
* Police Officers

Health care workers are at high risk for experiencing violence in the workplace. Examples of violence include threats, physical assaults, and muggings. According to estimates of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the rate of nonfatal occupational injuries and illnesses involving days away from work was 15.1 per 10,000 full-time workers in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nonfatal Occupational Injuries and Illnesses Requiring Days Away from Work, 2012. Retrieved March 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This rate is much higher than the rate for total private industries, which is 4.0 per 10,000 full-time workers.

Monitoring workplace violence trends is essential to identifying targeted prevention strategies. The [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ohsn/ Occupational Health Safety Network (OHSN)] is a secure electronic surveillance system developed by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)]] to address health and safety risks among health care personnel. Hospitals and other healthcare facilities can upload the occupational injury data they already collect to the secure database for analysis and benchmarking with other de-identified facilities. NIOSH works with OHSN participants in identifying and implementing timely and targeted interventions. OHSN modules currently focus on three high risk and preventable events that can lead to injuries or musculoskeletal disorders among healthcare personnel: musculoskeletal injuries from patient handling activities; slips, trips, and falls; and workplace violence. OHSN enrollment is open to all healthcare facilities.

Zhao was born in [[Qi County, Hebi]], [[Henan]], and moved to [[Taiwan]] in 1949 with her parents.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.zonaeuropa.com/20070603_1.htm|title = Zhao Yufen: Two Hometowns, Same Deep Love|last = |first = |date = 21 July 2006|work = People.com.cn|access-date = 9 November 2015|via = Zonaeuropa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zhao graduated from [[National Tsing Hua University]] (Taiwan) in 1971, and received her Ph.D from [[State University of New York|SUNY]] in 1975.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1979, she went on to become a researcher at the Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She became a professor at [[Tsinghua University]] (Beijing) in 1988 and in 1991, was elected to the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], then the youngest female academician.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In March 2007, Zhao created a petition to halt the construction of a chemical plant in [[Xiamen]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/27/AR2007062702962.html|title = Text Messages Giving Voice to Chinese|last = Cody|first = Edward|date = 28 June 2007|work = The Washington Post|access-date = 9 November 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Changing Media, Changing China|last = Gang|first = Qian|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2011|isbn = 9780199751983|location = |pages = 66–67|chapter = China's Emerging Public Sphere|last2 = Bandurski|first2 = David|editor-last = Shirk|editor-first = Susan L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zhao was against the plant, which was going to produce [[P-Xylene|paraxylene]] (PX), a [[carcinogen]]ic [[petrochemical]], due to health risks and pollution of the environment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.china.org.cn/english/environment/239503.htm|title = People vs. Chemical Plant|last = |first = |date = 14 January 2008|work = China.org|access-date = 9 November 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that "As a project with a high risk of poisonous emissions and explosions, the project should not be located close to a city."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; She also started writing letters to propose a relocation of the plant to He Lefeng, the Party chief of Xiamen.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=28339099&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Power to the People|last = Li|first = Li|date = 3 January 2008|journal = Beijing Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 9 November 2015|volume = 51|issue = 1|pages = 20–21|subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Months later, protesters used text messages to spread the word of a demonstration against the plant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Xiamen lawmakers voted overwhelmingly against the plant, which was located to Gulei Peninsula.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

June 15, 2014, Zhao, as the head of the Academy Zhao Yufen of Xiamen University, along with BIOasis, signed on for the construction of a Phosphorus &amp; Marine Science Research Center to be built at the Shandong International Biotechnology Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://en.luyetz.com/news/20140804133612368.htm|title = Academy Zhao Yufen and Her Research Team Start Cooperation with BIOasis|last = |first = |date = 15 June 2014|work = Luye Investment|access-date = 10 November 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
