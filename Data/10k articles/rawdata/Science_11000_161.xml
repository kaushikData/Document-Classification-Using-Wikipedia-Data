The '''ADM-160 MALD''' (Miniature Air-Launched Decoy) is a [[decoy]] missile developed by the United States.

==Overview==

===DARPA MALD program===
The Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD) program was begun in 1995 by [[DARPA]] as an effort to develop a small, low cost decoy missile for use in the [[Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses]]. [[Teledyne Ryan]] (acquired by [[Northrop Grumman]] in 1999) was granted a development contract for the ADM-160A in 1996, and the first test flight took place in 1999. The evaluation program was finished by 2001.

The [[US Air Force]] planned to acquire several thousand of ADM-160A's, but in 2001 this was reduced to at most 150 for a System Development and Demonstration (SDD) program.&lt;ref name="JAWA"&gt;[http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-160.html designation-systems.net ADM-160]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2002, the USAF cancelled the program because the drone didn't have enough range and endurance to meet the service's requirements or to perform other missions.&lt;ref name="PARAS"&gt;[http://www.vectorsite.net/twuav_06.html#m1 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles 6.0 Decoys] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227191933/http://www.vectorsite.net/twuav_06.html#m1 |date=December 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ADM-160A carries a Signature Augmentation Subsystem (SAS) which is composed of various active radar enhancers which cover a range of frequencies. The SAS can therefore simulate any aircraft, from the [[B-52 Stratofortress]] to the [[F-117 Nighthawk]].

The missile has folded wings to allow more compact carriage. On launch the wings unfold and a TJ-50 [[turbojet]] propels the missile on a pre-determined course which is composed of up to 100 different waypoints. An [[inertial navigation]] system with [[GPS]] support keeps the MALD on course. Although pre-programmed before the aircraft leaves the ground, the course can be modified by the pilot at any point up to launch.

===New USAF competition===

In 2002, the USAF renewed its interest in an air-launched decoy and started a new industry-wide competition for a variant with greater endurance.&lt;ref name="PARAS" /&gt; The contract for a new MALD was awarded to Raytheon in Spring 2003.

The Raytheon ADM-160B is similar in configuration to the ADM-160A, but has a trapezoidal fuselage cross section and is larger and heavier. It is powered by a [[Hamilton Sundstrand]] TJ-150, a more powerful variant of the TJ-50.

The first ADM-160B was delivered in Spring 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raytheon.com/newsroom/feature/mald_03-09/ U.S. Air Force accepts first delivery of Raytheon Miniature Air Launched Decoy]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 an "operationally significant quantity" of the drones were delivered to the Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investor.raytheon.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=84193&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;id=1408193 Raytheon Delivers on Miniature Air Launched Decoy Contract]&lt;/ref&gt; The USAF currently plans to procure about 1,500.

In 2008 a contract for a jamming variant MALD-J was awarded to Raytheon. It made its first freefall test in 2009 and passed its critical design review in early 2010.&lt;ref name="DID"&gt;[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/Raytheons-MALD-Decoys-Gaining-Versatility-04844/ Raytheons MALD Decoys Gaining Versatility]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://raytheon.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=1501&amp;pagetemplate=release Raytheon Miniature Air Launched Decoy Jammer Completes Critical Design Review]&lt;/ref&gt; The first MALD-J was delivered to the Air Force on September 6, 2012.  On September 24, Raytheon started operational testing, achieving four successful flights out of four launches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://raytheon.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=2174 Raytheon MALD-J Decoy Goes 4 for 4 in Operational Flight Tests] - Raytheon press release, September 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, the MALD-J completed operational testing, satisfying all requirements in 42 flight tests over the last two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-air-force-completes-operational-testing-on-raytheons-mald-j-300063167.html US Air Force completes operational testing on Raytheon's MALD-J] - PRNewswire.com, 14 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, Raytheon completed ground verification tests for the MALD and MALD-J for integration onto the [[MQ-9 Reaper]] UAV.  Integration onto the aircraft was expected sometime in 2013, with the goal for an unmanned [[suppression of enemy air defenses]] capability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/raytheon-and-general-atomics-team-up-to-integrate-mald-onto-reaper-382308/ Raytheon and General Atomics team-up to integrate MALD onto Reaper] - Flightglobal.com, February 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The company has also explored integration onto the smaller [[MQ-1 Predator]] and [[U.S. Army]] [[MQ-1C Gray Eagle]].&lt;ref name="flightglobal22july15"&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/raytheon-reveals-new-composite-missile-body-for-mald-414902/ Raytheon reveals new composite missile body for MALD decoy-jammer] - Flightglobal.com, 22 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Raytheon completed a four-year development program of the MALD, under budget.  The MALD and MALD-J successfully completed all 30 engineering and operational flight tests, with each version completing 15.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deagel.com/news/Miniature-Air-Launched-Decoy-Jammer-Completes-Flight-Testing_n000011565.aspx Miniature Air Launched Decoy-Jammer Completes Flight Testing] - Deagel.com, 16 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Air Force has cleared the B-model MALD for export.&lt;ref name="flightglobal22july15"/&gt;

In May 2014, Raytheon delivered the 1,000th MALD-J to the Air Force as part of the Lot 5 production contract.  The MALD program has achieved a perfect 33-for-33 flight test success record over the past two years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20140513-907705.html Raytheon delivers 1000th Miniature Air Launched Decoy- Jammer to US Air Force] - WSJ.com, 13 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, a MALD-J was test-flown with a radio data-link to expand situational awareness and allow for in-flight targeting adjustments.  While carrying out a jamming mission, the MALD-J was able to send situation awareness data to the EW Battle Manager, which used the information to adjust its mission while in-flight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shephardmedia.com/news/digital-battlespace/data-link-equipped-mald-j-flies-first-time/ Data link-equipped MALD-J flies for the first time] - Shephardmedia.com, 11 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, Raytheon revealed it had developed a new composite missile body for the MALD-J in partnership with [[Fokker Aerostructures]] and Italian race car manufacturer [[Dallara]] that is 25 percent cheaper to produce; Fokker adapted robotics to wind the carbon fiber fuselage instead of the conventional manual process and Dallara applied its lightweight structural technologies to airframe accessories such as air inlets and covers.  The new cheaper airframe design was first incorporated into Lot 7 production models in 2015, from the contract awarded in June 2014.&lt;ref name="flightglobal22july15"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shephardmedia.com/news/digital-battlespace/raytheon-builds-cheaper-mald-airframe/ Raytheon develops cheaper MALD] - Shephardmedia.com, 23 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== US Navy ===
The [[Naval Surface Warfare Center]] will place an order for the MALD-J.&lt;ref name="flightglobal27may11"&gt;Trimble, Stephen. [http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2011/05/27/357272/raytheon-jammer-attracts-us-navy-interest-as-roles-expand.html "Raytheon jammer attracts US Navy interest as roles expand."] ''Flight International'', 27 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems integration has been announced as of July 6, 2012, by the Raytheon Corp. for the U.S. Navy's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.  The process included a series of risk reduction activities and technology demonstrations.&lt;ref name="raytheon.mediaroom.com"&gt;Raytheon Corp. [http://raytheon.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=2121 "Raytheon and US Navy begin MALD-J Super Hornet integration"], 'Press Release', 6, July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 2015, Raytheon and the [[Naval Research Lab]] announced they had demonstrated a new rapid-replacement, modular architecture for the MALD-J for [[electronic warfare]] payloads. Four payloads, each customized for a specific mission and threat, were demonstrated in 12 captive carry flights; the payloads could be swapped out of a captive carry vehicle in less than one minute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shephardmedia.com/news/digital-battlespace/raytheon-demonstrates-new-mald-j-architecture/ Raytheon demos new MALD-J architecture] - Shephardmedia.com, 10 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Raytheon received a contract to develop an evolution of the MALD-J called the MALD-X, incorporating an improved electronic warfare payload, the ability to fly at low-altitude, and an enhanced net-enabled data-link.  The company hopes to transition the MALD-X into the MALD-N for the U.S. Navy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/farnborough-usaf-contracts-raytheon-to-develop-navy-427152/ USAF contracts Raytheon to develop navy-specific decoy] - Flightglobal.com, 10 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== British interest ===
The British [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] expressed interest on the MALD-V platform at the Paris Airshow in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Holye. [http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/paris-air-show-raytheon-advances-mald-j-as-uk-eyes-derivative-328032/ "PARIS AIR SHOW: Raytheon advances MALD-J, as UK eyes derivative."] ''Flight International'', 16 May 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental variants===
; MALI : The {{vanchor |Miniature Air-Launched Interceptor}} ({{vanchor |MALI}}) is an armed version of the ADM-160A which could be used against cruise missiles. It has a more powerful engine and a more [[aerodynamic]] shape for supersonic flight, and can be updated in mid flight via a command link to aircraft such as the [[E-3 Sentry]] [[Airborne Early Warning and Control|AWACS]].  It completed its development program in 2002.&lt;ref name="JAWA" /&gt;

;{{vanchor |MALD-V}} : Modular payload version that provides space for mission specific payloads of surveillance gear, radio/radar/infrared jammers or other equipment. This may provide the go-forward architecture, and give the option of turning MALD into a UAV, or even a combination killer-UAV/decoy.&lt;ref&gt;Defense Industry Daily [http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/Raytheons-MALD-Decoys-Gaining-Versatility-04844/ "Raytheon's MALD Decoys Gaining Versatility"], 1, December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; If equipped with sensor payloads, the MALD may be modified to be recovered so as not to lose valuable payloads after each flight.&lt;ref name="flightglobal27may11"/&gt; One payload option could be a [[thermobaric]] warhead, essentially turning the MALD into a [[cruise missile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/raytheon-explores-further-developments-after-mald-j-completes-operational-386668/ Raytheon explores further developments after MALD-J completes operational tests] - Flightglobal.com, 4 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

;{{vanchor |MASSM}} : {{vanchor |Miniature Autonomous Search and Strike Missile}}, proposed MALD upgrade to hunt [[transporter erector launcher]]s (TELs).  It would be equipped with [[LIDAR]], [[millimeter wave]] radar, and an [[imaging infrared]] sensor with a small warhead to accommodate fuel and satellite communications.  Depending on altitude and endurance, one MASSM could search {{convert|3,000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} of area.  May be recoverable.&lt;ref name="breakingdefense23jan15"&gt;[http://breakingdefense.com/2015/01/stopping-mobile-missiles-top-picks-for-offset-strategy/ Stopping Mobile Missiles: Top Picks For Offset Strategy:] - Breakingdefense.com, 23 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7183">'''Astrid Jóhanna Andreasen''' (born 1948 in [[Vestmanna]], [[Faroe Islands]]) is a Faroese textile and graphical artist, marine researcher and postage stamp designer. As a [[scientific illustrator]], she specialises in marine animals.

Early in her career she produced illustrations for collections of her father's poetry. Then in 1968 she entered a vocational school in [[Kerteminde]] in [[Denmark]] to become a teacher of embroidery. In 1970 she took a job as a therapist in [[Tórshavn]] hospital where she worked with mentally handicapped people, teaching them embroidery and other art forms.

From 1982 she learned scientific illustration at the Academy of Arts in [[Århus]], and became illustrator specialising in marine animals at the Jerlesborg School in [[Tjarnö]], [[Sweden]] in 1990. She is currently the only artist at the Faroese Natural History Museum, and has gained international recognition through illustrations she has produced for [[Postverk Føroya]] to use on many series of postage stamps.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2812">A '''ballistic galvanometer''' is a type of sensitive galvanometer; commonly a [[mirror galvanometer]]. Unlike a current-measuring galvanometer, the moving part has a large [[moment of inertia]], thus giving it a long [[oscillation]] period. It is really an [[integrator]] measuring the quantity of [[Electric charge|charge]] discharged through it. It can be either of the moving coil or moving magnet type.
[[Image:Ballistic galvanometer calibration setup.svg|thumb|250px|right|Ballistic galvanometer calibration setup.]]
[[Image:Grassot fluxmeter with cover removed.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Grassot fluxmeter, a form of ballistic galvanometer.]]
[[Image:Grassot Fluxmeter constant determination.svg|thumb|250px|right|Grassot fluxmeter calibration arrangement using a standard mutual inductor and a known quantity of electrical discharge. Measuring setup is similar.]]

Before first use the ballistic constant of the galvanometer must be determined. This is usually done by connecting to the galvanometer a known [[capacitor]], charged to a known [[voltage]], and recording the deflection. The constant K is calculated from the [[capacitance]] C, the voltage V and the deflection d:
&lt;math&gt;K=CV/d&lt;/math&gt;

where K is expressed in [[coulomb]]s per centimeter.

In operation the unknown quantity of charge Q (in coulombs) is simply: 
&lt;math&gt;Q=kd&lt;/math&gt;.

==Grassot Fluxmeter==

An interesting form of ballistic galvanometer is the Grassot fluxmeter. In order to operate correctly, the discharge time through the regular ballistic galvanometer must be shorter than the period of oscillation. For some applications, especially those involving inductors, this condition cannot be met. The Grassot fluxmeter solves this. Its construction is similar to that of a ballistic galvanometer, but its coil is suspended without any restoring forces in the suspension thread or in the current leads. The core (bobbin) of the coil is of a non-conductive material. When an electric charge is connected to the instrument, the coil starts moving in the magnetic field of the galvanometer's magnet, generating an opposing [[electromotive force]] and coming to a stop regardless of the time of the current flow. The change in the coil position is proportional only to the quantity of charge. The coil is returned to the zero position manually or by reversing the direction of the current.

'''''BioNyt Videnskabens Verden''''' (BioNews Science World) is a Danish language [[popular science]] magazine published by Foreningen af Yngre Biologer - Biologisk Forum. The magazine was launched in 1980 and is currently being published only in [[Denmark]].

==History and profile==
''BioNyt'' was established in 1980. According to the official website, the magazine is the oldest [[popular science]] magazine on international science currently published in Denmark.

During the 30 years of existence the founder and editor Ole Terney (biologist and librarian) has written all the articles except a handful written by other people.

Many issues focus on one theme like stem cells, the origin of life, astronomy, mnemotechnic, influenza, nanotechnology, CERN, climate change etc. The magazine also covers articles on biology and [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biotechnology|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/biosociety/pdf/ebe_report_300603_ec.pdf|work=EU|accessdate=5 October 2013|format=Report|date=31 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, such themes are also described in question-and-answer form on its website.

In [[psychology]], '''cognitivism''' is a theoretical framework for understanding the mind that gained credence in the 1950s. The movement was a response to [[behaviorism]], which cognitivists said neglected to explain [[cognition]]. [[Cognitive psychology]] derived its name from the Latin ''cognoscere'', referring to knowing and information, thus cognitive psychology is an information-processing psychology derived in part from earlier traditions of the investigation of thought and problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;Mandler, G.

Behaviorists acknowledged the existence of thinking, but identified it as a behavior. Cognitivists  argued that the way people think impacts their behavior and therefore cannot be a behavior in and of itself. Cognitivists later argued that thinking is so essential to psychology that the study of thinking should become its own field.&lt;ref name=Lilien-1 /&gt; However, cognitivists typically presuppose a specific form of mental activity, of the kind advanced by [[computationalism]].

== Cognitive development ==


The process of assimilating and expanding our intellectual horizon is termed as [[cognitive]] development. We have a complex [[physiological]] structure that absorbs a variety of [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] from the [[environment (systems)|environment]], stimuli being the interactions which are able to produce [[knowledge]] and skills. Parents   process   knowledge   informally   in   the home while teachers process knowledge formally in school. [[Knowledge]] should be pursued with zest and zeal; if not, then learning becomes a burden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=General Psychology|publisher=Neelkamal|page=60|edition=First edition, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attention ==


Attention is the first part of cognitive development. Learning takes place when the student gives attention towards the teacher. Interest and effort closely relate to attention. Attention is an active process which involves numerous outside stimuli.  The attention of an organism at any point in time involves three concentric circles; beyond awareness, margin, and focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=General Psychology|publisher=Neelkamal|page=59|edition=First edition, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How does learning occur? ==


[[Cognitive]] theory mainly stresses the acquisition of [[knowledge]] and growth of the mental structure. [[Cognitive]] theory tends to focus on conceptualizing the student's [[learning]] process: how information is received; how information is processed and organized into existing schema; how information is retrieved upon recall. In other words, cognitive theory seeks to explain the process of [[knowledge]] acquisition and the subsequent effects on the mental structures within the mind. Learning is not about the mechanics of what a learner does, but rather a process depending on what the learner already knows (existing information) and their method of acquiring new [[knowledge]] (how they integrate new information into their existing schemas). Knowledge acquisition is an activity consisting of internal codification of mental structures within the student's mind. Inherent to the theory, the student must be an active participant in their own learning process. Cognitive approaches mainly focus on the mental activities of the learner like mental planning, goal setting, and organizational strategies (Shell, 1980).
In [[cognitive]] theories not only the environmental factors and instructional components play an important role in learning. There are additional key elements like learning to code, transform, rehearse, and store and retrieve the information. Learning process includes learner’s thoughts, beliefs, and attitude values(Winna, 1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychology|url=http://northweststate.edu/wp-content/uploads/files/21143_ftp.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== What is the role of memory? ==


[[Memory]] plays a vital role in the [[learning]] process. Information is stored within memory in an organised, meaningful manner. Here, teacher and designers play different roles in the [[learning]] process. Teachers supposedly facilitate learning and the organization of information in an optimal way. Whereas designers supposedly use advanced techniques (such as analogies and hierarchical relationships) to help learners acquire new information to add to their prior [[knowledge]]. Forgetting is described as an inability to retrieve information from memory. [[Memory]] loss may be a mechanism used to discard situationally irrelevant information by assessing the relevance of newly acquired information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teaching Cognitivism|url=http://teachinglearningresources.pbworks.com/w/page/31012664/Cognitivism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How does transfer occur? ==


According to [[cognitive]] theory, if a learner knows how to implement [[knowledge]] in different contexts and conditions then we can say that transfer has occurred. (Schunk, 1991) Understanding is composed of knowledge - in the form of rules, concepts and discrimination (Duffy and Jonassen, 1991). Knowledge stored in [[memory]] is important, but the use of such knowledge is also important. Prior knowledge will be used for identifying similarities and differences between itself and novel [[information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning Theories|url=http://www.learning-theories.com/cognitivism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== What types of learning are explained in detail by this position? ==


Cognitive theory mostly explains complex forms of learning in terms of reasoning, problem solving and information processing (Schunk, 1991). Emphasis must be placed on the fact that the goal of all aforementioned viewpoints is considered to be the same - the transfer of knowledge to the student in the most efficient and effective manner possible (Bednar et al., 1991). Simplification and standardization are two techniques used to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of knowledge transfer. Knowledge can be analysed, decomposed and simplified into basic building blocks. There is a correlation with the behaviorist model of the knowledge transfer environment. Cognitivists stress the importance of efficient processing strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Teaching and Learning Cognitivism|url=http://teachinglearningresources.pbworks.com/w/page/31012664/Cognitivism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== What are the basic assumptions/ principles of the cognitive theory or relevant to instructional design? ==


A behaviorist uses feedback (reinforcement) to change the behavior in the desired direction, while the cognitivist uses the feedback for guiding and supporting the accurate [[mind|mental]] connections (Thomson, Simon son. &amp; Hargrave, 1992).
For different reasons learners' task analyzers are critical to both cognitivists and behaviorists. Cognitivists look at the learner's predisposition to learning (How does the learner activate, maintain and direct his/her learning?) (Thompson et . al., 1992). Additionally, cognitivists examine the learner's 'how to design' [[Teaching|instruction]] that it can be assimilated. (i. e ., what about the learners existing mental structures?) In contrast, the behaviorists look at learners how to determine where the lesson should begin (i. e., At what level the learners are performing successfully?) and what are the most effective reinforcements (i.e., What are the consequences that are most desired by the learner?).

There are some specific assumptions or principles that direct the instructional design:  active involvement of the learner in the learning process, learner control, meta cognitive training (e.g., self-planning, monitoring and revising techniques), the use of hierarchical analyses to identify and illustrate prerequisite relationships (cognitive task analysis procedure), facilitating optimal processing of structuring, organizing and sequencing information (use of cognitive strategies such as outlining, summaries, synthesizers, advance organizers etc.), encouraging the students to make connections with previously learned material, and creating [[learning]] environments (recall of prerequisite skills; use of relevant examples, analogies).

== How should instruction be structured? ==


[[Cognitive]] theories emphasize mainly on making [[knowledge]] meaningful and helping learners to organizing relate new [[information]] to existing [[knowledge]] in [[memory]] . Instruction should be   based on students existing schema or mental structures, to be effective. The organisation of information is connected in such a manner that it should relate to the existing knowledge in some   meaningful way. The examples of [[cognitive]] strategy are   Analogies metaphors. The other   cognitive strategies includes the use of framing, outlining the mnemonics, concept mapping, advance organizers and so forth ( West, Farmer, and Wolff,1991). The cognitive theory mainly emphasizes the major tasks of the teacher / designer and includes analyzing that various learning experiences to the learning situation which can impact learning outcomes of different individuals.
Organizing and structuring the new information to connect the learners previously acquired knowledge abilities and experiences.
The new information is effectively and efficiently assimilated/accommodated within the learners cognitive structure (Stepich and Newby, 1988 ).

==Theoretical approach==

Cognitivism has two major components, one methodological, the other theoretical. Methodologically, cognitivism adopts a [[positivist]] approach and the belief that psychology can be (in principle) fully explained by the use of the [[scientific method]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} This is also largely a [[reductionist]] goal, with the belief that individual components of mental function (the 'cognitive architecture') can be identified and meaningfully understood.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} The second is the belief that [[cognition]] consists of discrete, internal mental states ([[representations]] or [[symbols]]) whose manipulation can be described in terms of rules or [[algorithm]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}.

Cognitivism became the dominant force in [[psychology]] in the late-20th century, replacing [[behaviorism]] as the most popular paradigm for understanding mental function. [[Cognitive psychology]] is not a wholesale refutation of behaviorism, but rather an expansion that accepts that mental states exist.  This was due to the increasing criticism towards the end of the 1950s of simplistic learning models. One of the most notable criticisms was [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky's]] argument that language could not be acquired purely through conditioning, and must be at least partly explained by the existence of internal mental states.

The main issues that interest cognitive psychologists are the inner mechanisms of human thought and the processes of knowing. Cognitive psychologists have attempted to shed some light on the alleged mental structures that stand in a causal relationship to our physical actions.

==Criticisms of psychological cognitivism==

In the 1990s, various new theories emerged and challenged cognitivism and the idea that thought was best described as computation. Some of these new approaches, often influenced by phenomenological and [[postmodern philosophy]], include [[situated cognition]], [[distributed cognition]], [[dynamicism]], [[embodied cognition]]. Some thinkers working in the field of [[artificial life]] (for example [[Rodney Brooks]]) have also produced non-cognitivist models of cognition. On the other hand, much of early cognitive psychology, and the work of many currently active cognitive psychologists does not treat cognitive processes as computational.
The idea that mental functions can be described as information processing models has been criticised by [[philosopher]] [[John Searle]] and [[mathematician]] [[Roger Penrose]] who both argue that computation has some inherent shortcomings which cannot capture the fundamentals of mental processes. 
* Penrose uses [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel's]] [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|incompleteness theorem]] (which states that there are mathematical truths which can never be proven in a sufficiently strong mathematical system; any sufficiently strong system of axioms will also be incomplete) and [[Alan Turing|Turing's]] [[halting problem]] (which states that there are some things which are inherently non-computable) as evidence for his position.
* Searle has developed two arguments, the first (well known through his [[Chinese room]] [[thought experiment]]) is the '[[syntax]] is not [[semantics]]' argument—that a program is just syntax, while understanding requires semantics; therefore programs (hence cognitivism) cannot explain understanding. Such an argument presupposes the controversial notion of a [[private language]]. The second, which Searle now prefers but is less well known, is his 'syntax is not physics' argument—nothing in the world is intrinsically a computer program except as applied, described or interpreted by an observer, so either everything can be described as a computer and trivially a brain can but then this does not explain any specific mental processes, or there is nothing intrinsic in a brain that makes it a computer (program). Detractors of this argument might point out that the same thing could be said about any concept-object relation, and that the brain-computer analogy can be a perfectly useful model if there is a strong [[isomorphism]] between the two. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Both points, Searle claims, refute cognitivism.

Another argument against cognitivism is the problems of [[Ryle's Regress]] or the [[homunculus fallacy]].  Cognitivists have offered a number of arguments attempting to refute these attacks.{{Clarify|date=April 2013}}

'''''Cosmos''''' (styled '''''COSMOS''''') is a science magazine produced in Australia with a global outlook and literary ambitions, published by the [[Royal Institution of Australia|Royal Institution of Australia (RiAus)]]. It appears four times a year in print, and browser-based subscriber editions. It has a readership of 87,000 in print, and 130,000 via browser subscribers. Its Internet sister, Cosmos Online, publishes daily news and has an audience of 400,000+ unique visitors and 1 million+ page views monthly. It is subtitled "The science of everything" and is described as "a magazine of ideas, science, society and the future".

The magazine was established in November 2004 by the [[Melbourne]]-based neuroscientist and entrepreneur [[Alan Finkel]], [[Sydney]] magazine publishing executive Kylie Ahern and science journalists [[Wilson da Silva]] and [[Elizabeth Finkel]]. Launched in 2005, it has won 47 journalism and industry awards, including Magazine of the Year in 2009 and 2006, Editor of the Year in 2006 and 2005, and Best Internet Site at Australia's Bell Awards for Publishing Excellence, Best Magazine at the Bell Awards in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmos named magazine of the year at Bell Awards|url=https://mumbrella.com.au/cosmos-named-magazine-of-the-year-at-bell-awards-11703|publisher=Mumbrella|accessdate=29 August 2017|date=13 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a Reuters/World Conservation Union Award for Excellence in Environmental Reporting, an Earth Journalism Award and the American Institute of Physics Science Writing Award. The magazine is published by Cosmos Media Pty Ltd, a boutique publishing house that was named Best Publisher at the same awards ceremony in 2009 and 2006.

It was founded in [[Sydney]], where da Silva and Ahern were based. In June 2013 the company moved to [[Melbourne]] following its acquisition in February 2013 by co-founders Alan and Elizabeth Finkel, who purchased the remaining stake they did not already own from co-founders Kylie Ahern and Wilson da Silva, both of whom chose to leave the business to pursue other interests. In 2018, custodianship of the magazine was transferred to RiAus, a not-for-profit science media organisation based in [[Adelaide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://riaus.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/180723-Media-Release-The-Royal-Institution-of-Australia-COSMOS-Announcement.pdf|title=COSMOS Announcement|last=|first=|date=23 July 2018|website=Royal Institution of Australia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers whose work have featured include [[Margaret Wertheim]], [[Jared Diamond]], [[Tim Flannery]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Edward O. Wilson]], [[Michio Kaku]], [[Susan Greenfield]], [[Steven Pinker]], [[Paul Davies]], [[Simon Singh]] and [[Oliver Sacks]].

''Cosmos'' is produced in Australia and sold internationally, with a news-stand presence in New Zealand, the United States, the United Kingdom and Asia. In June 2006, the magazine launched &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/ COSMOS Online]&lt;/ref&gt; a daily Internet news and features service. It also produces a weekly email newsletter, ''Cosmos Update'', and the educational supplement ''Cosmos Teacher's Notes'', which reach 70% of Australian high schools and hundreds in the United Kingdom and New Zealand.

The magazine was the originator of ''[[Hello from Earth]]'', a web-based initiative to send messages from the public, each just 160 characters in length, to [[Gliese 581d]], the (then) nearest Earth-like planet outside the [[Solar System]]. Created as a science communication exercise for 2009 [[National Science Week]] in Australia, it collected nearly 26,000 messages that were beamed by [[NASA]]'s [[Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex]] on 28 August 2009.

== Similar titles ==
The name ''Cosmos'' has also been used for other magazines, including two different U.S. science fiction magazines between 1953 and 1954 (4 issues)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.locusmag.com/index/chklst/mg0165.htm Locusmag.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and 1977 (4 issues),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.locusmag.com/index/chklst/mg0166.htm Locusmag.com]&lt;/ref&gt; a British astronomy journal launched in April 2005 and produced in association with the [[European Space Agency]] and the scientific journal of the [[Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists]] entitled '[[Cosmos. Problems of Biological Sciences]]' (oryg. Kosmos. Problemy Nauk Biologicznych).

== Examples ==
Examples of datafication as applied to social and communication media are how [[Twitter]] datafies stray thoughts or datafication of [[Human resource management|HR]] by [[LinkedIn]] and others.  Alternative examples are diverse and include aspects of the built environment, and design via engineering and or other tools that tie data to formal, functional or other physical media outcomes of which [[Formsolver]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.formsolver.com&lt;/ref&gt; is an example.

== Impact ==

'''Human Resources'''
Data obtained from mobile phones, apps or social media usage is used to identify potential employees and their specific characteristics such as risk taking profile and personality. This data will replace personality tests. Rather using the traditional personality tests or the exams that measure the analytical thinking, using the data obtained through datafication will change existing exam providers. Also, with this data new personality measures will be developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Melissa|title=Turning Personality Into Data|url=http://www.mattersight.com/blog/turning-personality-into-data/|website=Mattersight, The Chemistry of Conversation|publisher=Mattersight Corporation|access-date= 5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ericsson.com/assets/local/news/2014/4/the-impact-of-datafication-on-strategic-landscapes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Insurance and Banking'''
Data is used to understand an individual’s risk profile and likelihood to pay a loan.

'''Customer relationship Management'''
Various industries are using datafication to understand their customers better and create appropriate triggers based on each customer’s personality and behaviour. This data is obtained from the language and tone a person uses in an email, phone call or social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Melissa|title=Turning Personality Into Data|url=http://www.mattersight.com/blog/turning-personality-into-data/|website=Mattersight, The chemistry of Conversation|publisher=Mattersight Corporation|access-date= 5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Datafying Cities'''
Through the data obtained from the sensors that are implemented into the cities, issues that can arise will be noticed and tackled before it becomes a serious issue in transportation, waste management, logistics, and energy, etc... Citizens can change their usual routes when there is a traffic jam. With the sensors that can measure air and water quality, cities can have more detailed understanding of the pollution levels and can enact new regulations based on real-time data.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ericsson.com/assets/local/news/2014/4/the-impact-of-datafication-on-strategic-landscapes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[atomic physics]], the '''electron magnetic moment''', or more specifically the '''electron magnetic dipole moment''', is the [[magnetic moment]] of an [[electron]] caused by its intrinsic properties of [[spin (physics)|spin]] and [[electric charge]]. The value of the electron magnetic moment is approximately {{val|-9.284764|e=-24|ul=J/T}}.
The electron magnetic moment has been measured to an accuracy of 7.6 parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Magnetic moment of an electron==

The electron is a [[charged particle]] of charge −1''e'', where ''e'' is the [[elementary charge|unit of elementary charge]]. Its [[angular momentum]] comes from two types of rotation: [[Spin (physics)|spin]] and [[orbital motion]]. From [[classical electrodynamics]], a rotating [[electric charge|electrically charged]] body creates a [[magnetic dipole]] with [[magnet#Modelling magnets|magnetic poles]] of equal magnitude but opposite [[wikt:magnetic polarity|polarity]]. This analogy holds as an electron indeed behaves like a tiny [[bar magnet]]. One consequence is that an external [[magnetic field]] exerts a [[Magnetic moment#Torque on a moment|torque]] on the electron [[magnetic moment]] depending on its orientation with respect to the field.

If the electron is visualized as a classical [[charged particle]] literally rotating about an axis with [[angular momentum]] '''L''', its magnetic dipole moment '''μ''' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mu} = \frac{-e}{2m_\text{e}} \mathbf{L},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[electron]] [[rest mass]]. Note that the [[angular momentum]] '''L''' in this equation may be the spin angular momentum, the orbital angular momentum, or the total angular momentum. It turns out that the classical result is off by a proportional factor for the spin magnetic moment. As a result, the classical result is corrected by multiplying it with a [[dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]] correction factor ''g'', known as the [[g-factor (physics)|g-factor]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mu} = g \frac{-e}{2m_\text{e}} \mathbf{L}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is usual to express the magnetic moment in terms of the [[reduced Planck constant]] ''ħ'' and the [[Bohr magneton]] ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mu} = -g \mu_\text{B} \frac{\mathbf{L}}{\hbar}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the [[Bohr magneton|magnetic moment is quantized]] in units of ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, correspondingly the [[Angular momentum quantum number|angular momentum is quantized]] in units of ''ħ''.

===Formal definition===
Classical notions such as the center of charge and mass   are, however,  hard to make precise for a quantum elementary particle. In practice the  definition used by experimentalists comes  from the  [[Form factor (quantum field theory)| form factors]] &lt;math&gt;F_i(q^2)&lt;/math&gt; 
appearing in the matrix element 
:&lt;math&gt;
 \langle p_f | j^\mu | p_i \rangle = \bar u(p_f) \left\{ F_1(q^2) \gamma^\mu +\frac{i \sigma^{\mu\nu}}{2m_{\rm e}}q_\nu F_2(q^2)+i\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\sigma_{\rho\sigma}q_\nu F_3(q^2)+\frac 1{2m_{\rm e}}\left(q^\mu-\frac{q^2}{2m} \gamma^\mu \right)\gamma_5 F_4(q^2)   \right\}  u(p_i)
&lt;/math&gt;

of the electromagnetic current operator between two on-shell states. Here &lt;math&gt; u(p_i)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \bar u(p_f)&lt;/math&gt; are 4-spinor  solution of the [[Dirac equation]] normalized so that &lt;math&gt; \bar u u=2m_{\rm e}&lt;/math&gt;, and  &lt;math&gt;q^\mu=p^\mu_f-p^\mu_i&lt;/math&gt; is the momentum transfer from the current to the electron. The &lt;math&gt; q^2=0&lt;/math&gt; form factor &lt;math&gt; F_1(0) = -e&lt;/math&gt; is the electron's charge, &lt;math&gt; \mu = (F_1(0)+F_2(0))/2m_{\rm e}&lt;/math&gt;  is its static magnetic dipole moment, and &lt;math&gt; -F_3(0)/2m_{\rm e}&lt;/math&gt; provides the formal definion of the [[electron electric dipole moment|electron's electric dipole moment]]. The remaining form factor &lt;math&gt;F_4(q^2)&lt;/math&gt; would,  if non zero, be  the [[anapole moment]].

===Spin magnetic dipole moment===

The [[spin magnetic moment]] is intrinsic for an electron.&lt;ref&gt;A. Mahajan and A. Rangwala.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=_tXrjggX7WwC&amp;pg=PA419&amp;lpg=PA419&amp;dq=%22intrinsic+dipole+moment%22+and+electron+%22Bohr+magneton%22 Electricity and Magnetism], p. 419 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; It is

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mu}_\text{s} = -g_\text{s} \mu_\text{B} \frac{\mathbf{S}}{\hbar}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here '''S''' is the electron spin angular momentum. The spin [[g-factor (physics)|g-factor]] is approximately two: ''g''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 2. The magnetic moment of an electron is approximately twice what it should be in classical mechanics. The factor of two implies that the electron appears to be twice as effective in producing a magnetic moment as the corresponding classical charged body.

The spin magnetic dipole moment is approximately one ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; because {{nowrap|''g'' ≈ 2}} and the electron is a spin-1/2 particle ({{nowrap|1=''S'' = ''ħ''/2}}):

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_\text{S} \approx 2\frac{e \hbar}{2m_\text{e}c}\frac{\frac{\hbar}{2}}{\hbar} = \mu_\text{B}.&lt;/math&gt; {{dubious|date=September 2015}}

The ''z'' component of the electron magnetic moment is

:&lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{\mu}_\text{s})_z = -g_\text{s} \mu_\text{B} m_\text{s},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[spin quantum number]]. Note that '''μ''' is a ''negative'' constant multiplied by the [[spin (physics)|spin]], so the magnetic moment is ''[[Antiparallel (mathematics)|antiparallel]]'' to the spin angular momentum.

The spin [[g-factor (physics)|g-factor]] {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 2}} comes from the [[Dirac equation]], a fundamental equation connecting the electron's spin with its electromagnetic properties. Reduction of the Dirac equation for an electron in a magnetic field to its non-relativistic limit yields the Schrödinger equation with a correction term, which takes account of the interaction of the electron's intrinsic magnetic moment with the magnetic field giving the correct energy.

For the electron spin, the most accurate value for the spin [[g-factor (physics)|g-factor]] has been experimentally determined to have the value

:{{val|2.00231930436182|(52)}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?eqae|search_for=electron+magnetic+moment&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that it is only two thousandths larger than the value from the Dirac equation. The small correction is known as the [[anomalous magnetic dipole moment]] of the electron; it arises from the electron's interaction with virtual photons in [[quantum electrodynamics]]. In fact, one famous triumph of the [[quantum electrodynamics]] theory is the accurate prediction of the electron g-factor. The most accurate value for the electron magnetic moment is

:{{val|-9.284764620|(57)|e=-24|u=J/T}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?muem&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orbital magnetic dipole moment===

The revolution of an electron around an axis through another object, such as the nucleus, gives rise to the orbital magnetic dipole moment. Suppose that the angular momentum for the orbital motion is '''L'''. Then the orbital magnetic dipole moment is

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mu}_L = -g_\text{L}\mu_\text{B} \frac{\mathbf{L}}{\hbar}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''g&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the electron orbital [[g-factor (physics)|g-factor]] and ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Bohr magneton]]. The value of ''g&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is exactly equal to one, by a quantum-mechanical argument analogous to the derivation of the [[gyromagnetic ratio|classical gyromagnetic ratio]]

===Total magnetic dipole moment===

The total magnetic dipole moment resulting from both spin and orbital angular momenta of an electron is related to the total angular momentum '''J''' by a similar equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mu}_J = g_J \mu_\text{B} \frac{\mathbf{J}}{\hbar}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[g-factor (physics)|g-factor]] ''g&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' is known as the [[Landé g-factor]], which can be related to ''g&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''g&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' by quantum mechanics. See [[Landé g-factor]] for details.

==Example: hydrogen atom==
For a [[hydrogen]] atom, an [[electron]] occupying the [[atomic orbital]] Ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''ℓ'',''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[magnetic dipole moment]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_L = -g_L \frac{\mu_\text{B}}{\hbar}\langle\Psi_{n,\ell,m}|L|\Psi_{n,\ell,m}\rangle = -\mu_\text{B}\sqrt{\ell(\ell + 1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here '''L''' is the orbital [[angular momentum]], ''n'', ''ℓ'' and ''m'' are the [[principal quantum number|principal]], [[azimuthal quantum number|azimuthal]] and [[magnetic quantum number|magnetic]] [[quantum numbers]] respectively.
The ''z'' component of the orbital magnetic dipole moment for an electron with a [[magnetic quantum number]] ''m&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt;'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{\mu}_L)_z = -\mu_\text{B} m_\ell.&lt;/math&gt;

==Electron spin in the Pauli and Dirac theories==

{{main article|Pauli equation|Dirac equation}}

The necessity of introducing half-integral [[spin (physics)|spin]] goes back experimentally to the results of the [[Stern–Gerlach experiment]]. A beam of atoms is run through a strong non-uniform magnetic field, which then splits into ''N'' parts depending on the intrinsic angular momentum of the atoms. It was found that for [[silver]] atoms, the beam was split in two—the ground state therefore could not be integral, because even if the intrinsic angular momentum of the atoms were as small as possible, 1, the beam would be split into 3 parts, corresponding to atoms with ''L&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' = −1, 0, and +1. The conclusion is that silver atoms have net intrinsic angular momentum of {{frac|1|2}}. [[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli]] set up a theory which explained this splitting by introducing a two-component wave function and a corresponding correction term in the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], representing a [[Semi-classical theory|semi-classical]] coupling of this [[wave function]] to an applied magnetic field, as so:

:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{1}{2m} \left [ \boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot \left ( \mathbf{p} - \frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A} \right ) \right ]^2 + e\phi.&lt;/math&gt;

Here '''A''' is the [[magnetic potential]] and ''ϕ'' the [[electric potential]], both representing the [[electromagnetic field]], and '''σ''' = (''σ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''σ&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''σ&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'') are the [[Pauli matrices]]. On squaring out the first term, a residual interaction with the magnetic field is found, along with the usual classical Hamiltonian of a charged particle interacting with an applied field:

:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{1}{2m}\left ( \mathbf{p} - \frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A} \right )^2 + e\phi - \frac{e\hbar}{2mc}\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot \mathbf{B}.&lt;/math&gt;

This Hamiltonian is now a 2 × 2 matrix, so the Schrödinger equation based on it must use a two-component wave function. Pauli had introduced the 2 × 2 sigma matrices as pure ''phenomenology''— Dirac now had a ''theoretical argument'' that implied that [[spin (physics)|spin]] was somehow the consequence of incorporating [[special relativity|relativity]] into [[quantum mechanics]]. On introducing the external electromagnetic [[4-potential]] into the Dirac equation in a similar way, known as [[minimal coupling]], it takes the form (in [[natural units]] ''ħ'' = ''c'' = 1)

:&lt;math&gt;\left [ -i\gamma^\mu\left ( \partial_\mu + ieA_\mu \right ) + m \right ] \psi = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \gamma^\mu&lt;/math&gt; are the [[gamma matrices]] (known as [[Dirac matrices]]) and ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]]. A second application of the [[Dirac equation#Properties|Dirac operator]] will now reproduce the Pauli term exactly as before, because the spatial Dirac matrices multiplied by ''i'', have the same squaring and commutation properties as the Pauli matrices. What is more, the value of the [[gyromagnetic ratio]] of the electron, standing in front of Pauli's new term, is explained from first principles. This was a major achievement of the Dirac equation and gave physicists great faith in its overall correctness. The Pauli theory may be seen as the low energy limit of the Dirac theory in the following manner. First the equation is written in the form of coupled equations for 2-spinors with the units restored:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
(mc^2 - E + e \phi) &amp; c\sigma\cdot \left (\mathbf{p} - \frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A} \right ) \\ -c\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot \left ( \mathbf{p} - \frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A} \right ) &amp; \left ( mc^2 + E - e \phi \right ) \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \psi_+ \\ \psi_- \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

so

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   (E - e\phi) \psi_+ - c\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \left( \mathbf{p} - \frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A} \right) \psi_- &amp;= mc^2 \psi_+ \\
  -(E - e\phi) \psi_- + c\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \left( \mathbf{p} - \frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A} \right) \psi_+ &amp;= mc^2 \psi_-
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming the field is weak and the motion of the electron non-relativistic, we have the total energy of the electron approximately equal to its [[rest energy]], and the momentum reducing to the classical value,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  E - e\phi &amp;\approx mc^2 \\
          p &amp;\approx m v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and so the second equation may be written

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_- \approx \frac{1}{2mc} \boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \left( \mathbf{p} - \frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A} \right) \psi_+&lt;/math&gt;

which is of order ''v/c'' - thus at typical energies and velocities, the bottom components of the [[Dirac spinor]] in the standard representation are much suppressed in comparison to the top components. Substituting this expression into the first equation gives after some rearrangement

:&lt;math&gt; \left(E - mc^2\right) \psi_+ = \frac{1}{2m} \left[ \boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot \left( \mathbf{p} - \frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A} \right) \right]^2 \psi_+ + e\phi \psi_+&lt;/math&gt;

The operator on the left represents the particle energy reduced by its rest energy, which is just the classical energy, so we recover Pauli's theory if we identify his 2-spinor with the top components of the Dirac spinor in the non-relativistic approximation. A further approximation gives the [[Schrödinger equation]] as the limit of the Pauli theory. Thus the Schrödinger equation may be seen as the far non-relativistic approximation of the Dirac equation when one may neglect spin and work only at low energies and velocities. This also was a great triumph for the new equation, as it traced the mysterious ''i'' that appears in it, and the necessity of a complex wave function, back to the geometry of space-time through the Dirac algebra. It also highlights why the Schrödinger equation, although superficially in the form of a diffusion equation, actually represents the propagation of waves.

It should be strongly emphasized that this separation of the Dirac spinor into large and small components depends explicitly on a low-energy approximation. The entire Dirac spinor represents an ''irreducible'' whole, and the components we have just neglected to arrive at the Pauli theory will bring in new phenomena in the relativistic regime - [[antimatter]] and the idea of creation and annihilation of particles.

In a general case (if a certain linear function of electromagnetic field does not vanish identically), three out of four components of the spinor function in the Dirac equation can be algebraically eliminated, yielding an equivalent fourth-order partial differential equation for just one component. Furthermore, this remaining component can be made real by a gauge transform.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Journal of Mathematical Physics, 52, 082303 (2011) ({{cite web |url=http://jmp.aip.org/resource/1/jmapaq/v52/i8/p082303_s1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120718231440/http://jmp.aip.org/resource/1/jmapaq/v52/i8/p082303_s1 |archivedate=2012-07-18 |df= }} or http://akhmeteli.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/JMAPAQ528082303_1.pdf )&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
The existence of the [[anomalous magnetic moment]] of the electron has been detected experimentally by [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|magnetic resonance]] method. This allows the determination of [[hyperfine splitting]] of electron shell energy levels in atoms of [[Isotopes of hydrogen#Hydrogen-1 .28protium.29|protium]] and [[deuterium]] using the measured resonance frequency for several transitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.74.250 [[Polykarp Kusch]], H. M. Foley]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.73.412 intrinsic moment of the electron]&lt;/ref&gt;

The magnetic moment of the electron has been measured using a one-electron quantum [[cyclotron]] and [[quantum nondemolition]] spectroscopy. The spin frequency of the electron is determined by the g-factor.

&lt;math&gt; \nu_s = \frac{g}{2} \nu_c&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;  \frac{g}{2} = \frac{\bar{\nu_c + \nu_a}}{\nu_c}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Ethanimine''' is an organonitrogen [[chemical compound|compound]] classified as an [[imine]].  It is not well known terrestrially, but has been detected in abundance towards [[Sagittarius B2]] (Sgr B2), a dense interstellar cloud in between stars towards the galactic center of the [[Milky Way]]. The distance between the Sgr B2 cloud and center of galaxy is 100 pc (1 pc=3.26l y). Ethanimine is mainly found in hot cores of ISM clouds; in case of Sgr B2, the region would be the Sgr B2 N and Sgr B2 M.&lt;ref&gt;Miao, Y., Mehringer, D. M., Kuan, Y.-J., &amp; Snyder, L. E.

The '''Exploration Mission-3''', or '''EM-3''', is a planned 2024 mission of the [[Space Launch System]] and second crewed mission of [[NASA]]'s [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] spacecraft.&lt;ref name="planetary-20180906" /&gt; The intended goal of the mission is to deliver the '''ESPRIT''' and '''U.S. Utilization''' modules to the [[Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway]] (LOP-G).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sloss|first1=Philip|title=NASA evaluates EM-2 launch options for Deep Space Gateway PPE|url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2017/12/nasa-evaluates-em-2-launch-of-space-gateways-ppe/|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission objectives==
The EM-3 mission plan is to send four astronauts in the second manned [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] capsule into a near-rectilinear halo orbit around the Moon for a maximum of 26 days. It will also deliver two more elements of the future [[Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway]] (LOP-G), a small [[space station]], to lunar orbit.

'''''Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid''''', also known as '''''GEB''''', is a 1979 book by [[Douglas Hofstadter]]. 
By exploring common themes in the lives and works of logician [[Kurt Gödel]], artist [[M. C. Escher]], and composer [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], the book expounds concepts fundamental to [[mathematics]], [[symmetry]], and [[intelligence]]. Through illustration and analysis, the book discusses how, through [[self-reference]] and formal rules, systems can acquire meaning despite being made of "meaningless" elements. It also discusses what it means to communicate, how knowledge can be represented and stored, the methods and limitations of symbolic representation, and even the fundamental notion of "meaning" itself.

In response to confusion over the book's theme, Hofstadter emphasized that ''Gödel, Escher, Bach'' is not about the relationships of [[mathematics and art|mathematics, art]], and [[music and mathematics|music]]—but rather about how [[Cognitive science|cognition]] [[emergence|emerges]] from hidden neurological mechanisms. One point in the book presents an analogy about how individual [[neurons]] in the [[brain]] coordinate to create a unified sense of a coherent mind by comparing it to the social organization displayed in a [[Ant colony|colony of ants]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.11/kelly.html By Analogy: A talk with the most remarkable researcher in artificial intelligence today, Douglas Hofstadter, the author of Gödel, Escher, Bach] Wired Magazine, November 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizcharts.com/stoa_del_sol/conscious/conscious2.html|title=Perspective of Mind: Douglas Hofstadter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tagline "a metaphorical [[fugue]] on minds and machines in the spirit of [[Lewis Carroll]]" was used by the publisher to describe the book.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0465026567/ref=sib_dp_pt#reader-link cover].&lt;/ref&gt;
==Structure==

''Gödel, Escher, Bach'' takes the form of interweaving narratives. The main chapters alternate with dialogues between imaginary characters, usually [[Achilles and the tortoise]], first used by [[Zeno of Elea]] and later by [[Lewis Carroll]] in "[[What the Tortoise Said to Achilles]]". These origins are related in the first two dialogues, and later ones introduce new characters such as the Crab. These narratives frequently dip into [[self-reference]] and [[metafiction]].

[[Word play]] also features prominently in the work. Puns are occasionally used to connect ideas, such as "the Magnificrab, Indeed" with Bach's ''Magnificat in D''; "[[SHRDLU]], Toy of Man's Designing" with Bach's ''[[Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring]]''; and "[[Typographical Number Theory]]", or "[[trinitrotoluene|TNT]]", which inevitably reacts explosively when it attempts to make statements about itself. One dialogue contains a story about a genie (from the Arabic "[[Djinn]]") and various "tonics" (of both the [[Tonic water|liquid]] and [[Tonic (music)|musical]] varieties), which is titled "[[Gin and tonic|Djinn and Tonic]]".

One dialogue in the book is written in the form of a [[crab canon]], in which every line before the midpoint corresponds to an identical line past the midpoint. The conversation still makes sense due to uses of common phrases that can be used as either greetings or farewells ("Good day") and the positioning of lines that double as an answer to a question in the next line. Another is a sloth canon, where one character repeats the lines of another, but slower and negated.

==Themes==

The book contains many instances of [[recursion]] and [[self-reference]], where objects and ideas speak about or refer back to themselves. One is [[Quine (computing)|Quining]], a term Hofstadter invented in homage to [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], referring to programs that only produce their own [[source code]]. Another is the presence of a fictional author in the index, [[Egbert B. Gebstadter]], a man with initials E, G, and B and a surname that partially matches Hofstadter. A phonograph dubbed "Record Player X" destroys itself by playing a record titled ''I Cannot Be Played on Record Player X'' (an analogy to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]]), an examination of [[canon (music)|canon]] form in [[music]], and a discussion of Escher's [[Drawing Hands|lithograph of two hands drawing each other]]. To describe such self-referencing objects, Hofstadter coins the term "[[strange loop]]"—a concept he examines in more depth in his follow-up book ''[[I Am a Strange Loop]]''. To escape many of the logical contradictions brought about by these self-referencing objects, Hofstadter discusses [[Zen]] [[koan]]s. He attempts to show readers how to perceive reality outside their own experience and embrace such paradoxical questions by rejecting the premise—a strategy also called [[Mu (negative)|"unasking"]].

Elements of [[computer science]] such as [[call stack]]s are also discussed in ''Gödel, Escher, Bach'', as one dialogue describes the adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise as they make use of "pushing potion" and "popping tonic" involving entering and leaving different layers of reality. Subsequent sections discuss the basic tenets of logic, self-referring statements, ("typeless") systems, and even programming. Hofstadter further creates [[BlooP and FlooP]], two simple [[programming language]]s, to illustrate his point.

==Puzzles==

The book is filled with puzzles, such as Hofstadter's [[MU puzzle]]. For example, the chapter titled ''Contracrostipunctus'' combines the words ''[[acrostic]]'' and ''contrapunctus'' ([[counterpoint]]). In a dialogue between Achilles and the Tortoise, the author hints that there is a contrapunctal acrostic in the chapter that refers both to the author (Hofstadter) and Bach. This can be found by taking the first word of each paragraph, to reveal: '''H'''ofstadter's '''C'''ontracrostipunctus '''A'''crostically '''B'''ackwards '''S'''pells ''''J'''. S. Bach'. The second acrostic is found by taking the first letters of the first (in bold) and reading them backwards to get "J. S. Bach" (just as the first acrostic claims).

==Impact==

''Gödel, Escher, Bach'' won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for general non-fiction&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/1980 | title = The Prizes | year = 1980 | publisher = Pulitzer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Book Award]] for Science.&lt;ref name=nba1980&gt;
[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1980 "National Book Awards – 1980"]. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;This was the [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Science|award for hardcover Science]].  From 1980 to 1983, the [[National Book Award#History|National Book Award history]] gave separate awards to hardcover and paperback books in many categories, including [[National Book Award for Nonfiction|several nonfiction subcategories]]. Most paperback award-winners were reprints of earlier works; the 1980 Science was eligible for both awards as a new book.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Gardner]]'s July 1979 column in [[Scientific American]] stated, "Every few decades, an unknown author brings out a book of such depth, clarity, range, wit, beauty and originality that it is recognized at once as a major literary event."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Somers|first=James|title=The Man Who Would Teach Machines to Think|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/11/the-man-who-would-teach-machines-to-think/309529/|work=[[The Atlantic]]|publisher=[[The Atlantic Media Company]]|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Summer 2007, the [[MIT|Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] created an online course for high school students built around the book.&lt;ref name = "MIT"&gt;{{citation | url = http://ocw.mit.edu/high-school/humanities-and-social-sciences/godel-escher-bach/ | publisher = MIT | title = GEB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its February 19, 2010 investigative summary on the [[2001 anthrax attacks]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] suggested that [[Bruce Edwards Ivins]] was inspired by the book  to hide secret codes based upon [[nucleotide sequence]]s in the [[anthrax]]-laced letters he allegedly sent in September and October 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/amerithrax/docs/amx-investigative-summary.pdf |title=Amerithrax Investigative Summary |publisher=United States Department of Justice |format=PDF |date=February 19, 2010 |access-date=2010-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128035809/http://www.justice.gov/amerithrax/docs/amx-investigative-summary.pdf |archive-date=2010-11-28 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; using bold letters, as suggested on page 404 of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/amerithrax/docs/j-geb-page-%20404.pdf |title=Page 404 of Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid |format=PDF |publisher=United States Department of Justice |date= |access-date=2010-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128035834/http://www.justice.gov/amerithrax/docs/j-geb-page-%20404.pdf |archive-date=2010-11-28 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Willman|Willman, David]] (2011), ''The Mirage Man: Bruce Ivins, the Anthrax Attacks, and America's Rush to War''; [[New York City|New York]]: [[Bantam Books]], pg 300.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also suggested that he attempted to hide the book from investigators by throwing it in the trash.

==Translation==

Hofstadter claims the idea of translating his book "never crossed [his] mind" when he was writing it—but when his publisher brought it up, he was "very excited about seeing [the] book in other languages, especially… French." He knew, however, that "there were a million issues to consider" when translating,&lt;ref name="Hofstadter_1999_16"&gt;{{harvnb|Hofstadter|1999|p=xxxiv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; since the book relies not only on word-play, but on "structural puns" as well—writing where the form and content of the work mirror each other (such as the "[[Crab canon]]" dialogue, which reads almost exactly the same forwards as backwards).

Hofstadter gives an example of translation trouble in the paragraph "Mr. Tortoise, Meet Madame Tortue", saying translators "instantly ran headlong into the conflict between the feminine gender of the French noun ''tortue'' and the masculinity of my character, the Tortoise."&lt;ref name="Hofstadter_1999_16" /&gt; Hofstadter agreed to the translators' suggestions of naming the French character ''Madame Tortue'', and the Italian version ''Signorina Tartaruga''.&lt;ref name="Hofstadter_1999_17"&gt;{{harvnb|Hofstadter|1999|pp=xxxiv–xxxv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of other troubles translators might have retaining meaning, Hofstadter "painstakingly went through every sentence of ''Gödel, Escher, Bach'', annotating a copy for translators into any language that might be targeted."&lt;ref name="Hofstadter_1999_16" /&gt;

Translation also gave Hofstadter a way to add new meaning and puns. For instance, in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the subtitle is not a translation of ''an Eternal Golden Braid'', but a seemingly unrelated phrase ''Jí Yì Bì'' (集异璧, literally "collection of exotic jades"), which is [[homophone|homophonic]] to ''GEB'' in Chinese. Some material regarding this interplay is in Hofstadter's later book, ''[[Le Ton beau de Marot]]'', which is mainly about translation.

'''Henry Herman Leopold Adolph Brose''' (15 September 1890 – 24 February 1965) was an [[Australia]]n [[physicist]]. Born in [[Adelaide]], he attended [[Prince Alfred College]] and graduated from the [[University of Adelaide]] in 1910 with a [[B.Sc.]] in mathematics. A member of the [[Sport at the University of Adelaide|Adelaide University Athletics Club]], Brose as awarded a University Blue for Athletics in 1910. In 1911-12 he taught French at Prince Alfred College, and in 1913 was awarded the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] for [[South Australia]].

Brose went up to [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] to study mathematics. While visiting relatives in [[Hamburg]] in 1914, he was arrested by the German authorities and interned as a civilian prisoner for the duration of the [[First World War]]. During his captivity Brose became interested in the [[Theory of Relativity]] and translated some German texts into English. On return to Oxford, he was awarded B.A. and M.A. degrees in 1919, and in 1925 he completed a D. Phil. on the motion of electrons in oxygen, under the supervision of [[John Sealy Edward Townsend]]. He then went on to hold a number of academic positions including Lecturer in Physics at the [[University of Sydney]] and Professor of Physics at the [[University of Nottingham]]. From 1920 and 1936 he translated sixteen physics texts from German into English. Brose later went on to work in cancer research, holding positions as a [[physicist]], a [[pathologist]] and a [[biochemist]].

Brose made an enormous contribution to the scientific world of his time both in Australia and across the world, as indicated by his vast collection of Manuscripts still archived in the University of Adelaide.&lt;ref name=UofAoverview&gt;[http://www.adelaide.edu.au/library/special//brose.html#over Henry Brose Manuscripts.] University of Adelaide.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
Brose acted as an interpreter when Einstein visited the University of Nottingham in 1930 and 1931.&lt;ref name=UofAoverview/&gt;

'''High Energy Density Matter''' ('''HEDM''') is a class of [[energetic material]]s, particularly [[fuel]], with a high ratio of potential [[chemical energy]] output to density, usually termed "[[thrust-to-weight ratio]]", hence "high energy density".  The substances are extremely reactive, therefore potentially dangerous, and some consider them impractical.  Researchers are looking into High Energy Density Matter that can provide much more lift than the current [[liquid hydrogen]]-[[liquid oxygen]] reactions used in today's [[spacecraft]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3016">In [[information theory]], the '''information projection''' or '''I-projection''' of a [[probability distribution]] ''q'' onto a set of distributions ''P'' is

:&lt;math&gt;p^* = \underset{p \in P}{\arg\min} \operatorname{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(p||q)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D_{\mathrm{KL}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] from ''q'' to ''p''. Viewing the Kullback–Leibler divergence as a measure of distance, the I-projection &lt;math&gt;p^*&lt;/math&gt; is the "closest" distribution to ''q'' of all the distributions in ''P''.

The I-projection is useful in setting up information geometry, notably because of the following inequality, valid when ''P'' is convex:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1 = Cover|first1 = Thomas M.|last2 = Thomas|first2 = Joy A.|title = Elements of Information Theory|publisher = Wiley Interscience|edition = 2|date = 2006|location = Hoboken, New Jersey|pages = 367(theorem 11.6.1)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(p||q) \geq \operatorname{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(p||p^*) + \operatorname{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(p^*||q)&lt;/math&gt;

This inequality can be interpreted as an information-geometric version of Pythagoras' triangle inequality theorem, where KL divergence is viewed as squared distance in a Euclidean space.

It is worthwhile to note that since &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(p||q) \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt; and continuous in p, 
if ''P'' is closed and non-empty, then there exists at least one minimizer to the optimization problem framed above. Furthermore if ''P'' is convex, then the optimum distribution is unique.

The reverse I-projection also known as '''moment projection''' or '''M-projection''' is

&lt;math&gt;p^* = \underset{p \in P}{\arg\min} \operatorname{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(q||p)&lt;/math&gt;

Since the KL divergence is not symmetric in its arguments, the I-projection and the M-projection will exhibit different behavior. For I-projection, &lt;math&gt; p(x) &lt;/math&gt; will typically
under-estimate the support of &lt;math&gt; q(x) &lt;/math&gt; and will lock onto one of its modes. This is due to &lt;math&gt; p(x)=0 &lt;/math&gt;, whenever &lt;math&gt; q(x)=0 &lt;/math&gt; to make sure KL divergence stays finite. For M-projection, &lt;math&gt; p(x) &lt;/math&gt; will typically over-estimate the support of &lt;math&gt; q(x) &lt;/math&gt;. This is due to &lt;math&gt; p(x) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt; q(x) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; to make sure KL divergence stays finite.

 
The concept of information projection can be extended to arbitrary statistical f-divergences and other   divergences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Nielsen|first1 = Frank | title = What is... an information projection?|publisher = AMS  |volume =65 | number =3|year = 2018|pages = 321-324|url = http://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201803/rnoti-p321.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6180">In [[information theory]] and [[statistics]], '''Kullback's inequality''' is a lower bound on the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] expressed in terms of the [[large deviations theory|large deviations]] [[rate function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Aimé |last=Fuchs |first2=Giorgio |last2=Letta |title=L'inégalité de Kullback.

:&lt;math&gt;D_{KL}(P\|Q) \ge \Psi_Q^*(\mu'_1(P)),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Psi_Q^*&lt;/math&gt; is the rate function, i.e. the [[convex conjugate]] of the [[cumulant]]-generating function, of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mu'_1(P)&lt;/math&gt; is the first [[Moment (mathematics)|moment]] of &lt;math&gt;P.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Cramér–Rao bound]] is a corollary of this result.

==Proof==
Let ''P'' and ''Q'' be [[probability distribution]]s (measures) on the real line, whose first moments exist, and such that [[Absolutely_continuous#Absolute_continuity_of_measures|''P''&lt;&lt;''Q'']]. Consider the '''[[natural exponential family]]''' of ''Q'' given by
:&lt;math&gt;Q_\theta(A) = \frac{\int_A e^{\theta x}Q(dx)}{\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{\theta x}Q(dx)}
   = \frac{1}{M_Q(\theta)} \int_A e^{\theta x}Q(dx)&lt;/math&gt;
for every measurable set ''A'', where &lt;math&gt;M_Q&lt;/math&gt; is the '''[[moment-generating function]]''' of ''Q''.  (Note that ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=''Q''.)  Then
:&lt;math&gt;D_{KL}(P\|Q) = D_{KL}(P\|Q_\theta)
   + \int_{\mathrm{supp}P}\left(\log\frac{\mathrm dQ_\theta}{\mathrm dQ}\right)\mathrm dP.&lt;/math&gt;
By [[Gibbs' inequality]] we have &lt;math&gt;D_{KL}(P\|Q_\theta) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; so that
:&lt;math&gt;D_{KL}(P\|Q) \ge
   \int_{\mathrm{supp}P}\left(\log\frac{\mathrm dQ_\theta}{\mathrm dQ}\right)\mathrm dP
 = \int_{\mathrm{supp}P}\left(\log\frac{e^{\theta x}}{M_Q(\theta)}\right) P(dx)&lt;/math&gt;
Simplifying the right side, we have, for every real θ where &lt;math&gt;M_Q(\theta) &lt; \infty:&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;D_{KL}(P\|Q) \ge \mu'_1(P) \theta - \Psi_Q(\theta),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu'_1(P)&lt;/math&gt; is the first moment, or mean, of ''P'', and &lt;math&gt;\Psi_Q = \log M_Q&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''[[cumulant|cumulant-generating function]]'''.  Taking the supremum completes the process of [[convex conjugate|convex conjugation]] and yields the [[rate function]]:
:&lt;math&gt;D_{KL}(P\|Q) \ge \sup_\theta \left\{ \mu'_1(P) \theta - \Psi_Q(\theta) \right\}
   = \Psi_Q^*(\mu'_1(P)).&lt;/math&gt;

==Corollary: the Cramér–Rao bound==
{{main|Cramér–Rao bound}}
===Start with Kullback's inequality===
Let ''X''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; be a family of probability distributions on the real line indexed by the real parameter θ, and satisfying certain [[Cramér–Rao_bound#Regularity_conditions|regularity conditions]].  Then
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac {D_{KL}(X_{\theta+h}\|X_\theta)} {h^2}
    \ge \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac {\Psi^*_\theta (\mu_{\theta+h})}{h^2},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Psi^*_\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[convex conjugate]] of the [[Cumulant|cumulant-generating function]] of &lt;math&gt;X_\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\theta+h}&lt;/math&gt; is the first moment of &lt;math&gt;X_{\theta+h}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Left side===
The left side of this inequality can be simplified as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\lim_{h\to  0} \frac {D_{KL}(X_{\theta+h}\|X_\theta)} {h^2} &amp;=\lim_{h\to  0} \frac 1 {h^2} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \log \left( \frac{\mathrm dX_{\theta+h}}{\mathrm dX_\theta} \right) \mathrm dX_{\theta+h} \\
&amp;=\lim_{h\to  0} \frac 1 {h^2} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \log\left( 1- \left (1-\frac{\mathrm dX_{\theta+h}}{\mathrm dX_\theta} \right ) \right) \mathrm dX_{\theta+h} \\
&amp;= \lim_{h\to  0} \frac 1 {h^2} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left[ \left( 1 - \frac{\mathrm dX_\theta}{\mathrm dX_{\theta+h}} \right) +\frac 1 2 \left( 1 - \frac{\mathrm dX_\theta}{\mathrm dX_{\theta+h}} \right) ^ 2
 + o \left( \left( 1 - \frac{\mathrm dX_\theta}{\mathrm dX_{\theta+h}} \right) ^ 2 \right) \right]\mathrm dX_{\theta+h} &amp;&amp; \text{Taylor series for } \log(1-t) \\
&amp;= \lim_{h\to  0} \frac 1 {h^2} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left[ \frac 1 2 \left( 1 - \frac{\mathrm dX_\theta}{\mathrm dX_{\theta+h}} \right)^2 \right]\mathrm dX_{\theta+h} \\
&amp;= \lim_{h\to  0} \frac 1 {h^2} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left[ \frac 1 2 \left( \frac{\mathrm dX_{\theta+h} - \mathrm dX_\theta}{\mathrm dX_{\theta+h}} \right)^2  \right]\mathrm dX_{\theta+h} \\
&amp;= \frac 1 2 \mathcal I_X(\theta)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
which is half the [[Fisher information]] of the parameter θ.

===Right side===
The right side of the inequality can be developed as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac {\Psi^*_\theta (\mu_{\theta+h})}{h^2}
= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac 1 {h^2} {\sup_t \{\mu_{\theta+h}t - \Psi_\theta(t)\} }.
&lt;/math&gt;
This supremum is attained at a value of ''t''=τ where the first derivative of the cumulant-generating function is &lt;math&gt;\Psi'_\theta(\tau) = \mu_{\theta+h},&lt;/math&gt; but we have &lt;math&gt;\Psi'_\theta(0) = \mu_\theta,&lt;/math&gt; so that
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi''_\theta(0) = \frac{d\mu_\theta}{d\theta} \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac h \tau.&lt;/math&gt;
Moreover,
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac {\Psi^*_\theta (\mu_{\theta+h})}{h^2}
   = \frac 1 {2\Psi''_\theta(0)}\left(\frac {d\mu_\theta}{d\theta}\right)^2
   = \frac 1 {2\mathrm{Var}(X_\theta)}\left(\frac {d\mu_\theta}{d\theta}\right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;
===Putting both sides back together===
We have:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac 1 2 \mathcal I_X(\theta)
   \ge \frac 1 {2\mathrm{Var}(X_\theta)}\left(\frac {d\mu_\theta}{d\theta}\right)^2,&lt;/math&gt;
which can be rearranged as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Var}(X_\theta) \ge \frac{(d\mu_\theta / d\theta)^2} {\mathcal I_X(\theta)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The consistency of the interligand distances (F-F and O-F) in the above molecules is striking and this phenomenon is repeated across a wide range of molecules and forms the basis for LCP theory.

==Ligand radius==
From a study of known structural data a series of inter-ligand distances has been determined&lt;ref name=GillespieMatta2001/&gt; and it has been found that there is a constant inter-ligand radius for a given central atom. The table below shows the inter-ligand radius (pm) for some of the period 2 elements:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Ligand
! Beryllium

| 113
| 108
| 106
|-
| Cl
| 168
| 151
| 144
| 142
|}
The ligand radius should not be confused with the [[ionic radius]].

==Treatment of lone pairs==
In LCP theory a lone pair is treated as a ligand. Gillespie terms the lone pair a lone pair domain and states that these lone pair domains push the ligands together until they reach the interligand distance predicted by the relevant inter-ligand radii.&lt;ref name=GillespieMatta2001/&gt; An example demonstrating this is shown below, where the F-F distance is the same in the AF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and AF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; species :
{| class="wikitable"

| 238

|}

==LCP and VSEPR==
LCP and VSEPR make very similar predictions as to geometry but LCP theory  has the advantage that predictions are more quantitative particularly for the second period elements, Be, B, C, N, O, F. Ligand -ligand repulsions are important when&lt;ref name=GillespieMatta2001/&gt; 
*the central atom is small e.g. period 2, (Be, B, C, N, O)
*the ligands are only weakly electronegative compared to the central atom
*the ligands are large compared to the central atom
* there are 5 or more ligands around the central atom

=== United Kingdom ===
[[EE Limited|EE]], a large mobile network operator in the UK, plans to trial a 5G network in October 2018. A small number of businesses and homes in [[East London Tech City]] will take part in the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.techradar.com/news/ee-to-switch-on-uks-first-5g-trial-in-london|title=EE to switch on 'UK's first' 5G trial in London|first1=Steve|last1=McCaskill|date=June 6, 2018|work=TechRadar|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BT Group]], who owns EE, had previously said during a presentation in May 2018 that they plan to launch a commercial 5G product "within 18 months".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/bt/144518-bt-will-be-first-to-launch-uk-5g-in-2019|title=BT will be first to launch UK 5G in 2019|first1=Chris|last1=Hall|date=May 16, 2018|work=Pocket-lint|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UK]] first plans to deploy 5G to [[London]] and other major cities (e.g., [[Bristol]], [[Birmingham]]) as a starting point, and then it will establish a 5G network in other major cities. The next step will be for small- and medium-sized towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://5g.co.uk/coverage/|title=5G Coverage and Networks|website=5g.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
US operators' launch plans fall into two distinct categories: Fixed wireless and mobile. Fixed wireless typically services residential broadband customers with speeds in excess of 1 Gbit/s using mmWave bands. Mobile launch will use sub-6&amp;nbsp;GHz spectrum in traditional LTE or newly-allocated bands with similar performance to LTE.

{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2016}}

'''[[Foreign-exchange reserves]]''' (also called '''Forex reserves''') are, in a strict sense, ''only'' the foreign-currency deposits held by national [[central bank]]s and [[monetary authority|monetary authorities]] (''See'' [[List of countries by foreign-exchange reserves (excluding gold)]]). However, in '''popular usage and in the list below''', it also includes [[gold reserve]]s, [[special drawing rights]] (SDRs) and [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) reserve position because this total figure, which is usually more accurately termed as '''official reserves''' or '''international reserves''' or '''official international reserves''', is more readily available.

These foreign-currency deposits are the [[financial asset]]s of the central banks and monetary authorities that are held in different [[reserve currency|reserve currencies]] (e.g. the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]], the [[Euro]], the [[Japanese yen]] and the [[Pound sterling]]) and which are used to back its liabilities (e.g. the local currency issued and the various [[bank reserves]] [[deposit account|deposited]] with the central bank by the [[government]] or [[financial institution]]s). Before the end of the [[gold standard]], gold was the preferred reserve currency. Some nations are converting foreign-exchange reserves into [[sovereign wealth fund]]s, which can rival foreign-exchange reserves in size.

The list below is mostly based on the latest available IMF data, and while most nations report in U.S. dollars, a few nations in [[Eastern Europe]] report solely in Euros. And since all the figures below are in U.S. dollar equivalence, [[exchange rate]] fluctuations can have a significant impact on these figures.

===Notes===
#{{note|a}}Hong Kong and Macau report separate figures.
#{{note|b}}Indian reports are released on a weekly basis with the figures being of the previous week.
#{{note|c}}The Iranian government does not report the foreign exchange reserves as a matter of policy and all figures are estimates calculated by international or foreign institutes, which are occasionally endorsed by Iranian officials without disclosing the exact numbers.

==Currency composition of foreign-exchange reserves==
IMF releases the quarterly data on the currency composition of official foreign exchange reserves. The data are reported to the IMF on a voluntary and confidential basis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43406">[[File:Unemployment rate map of the world (ILO).svg|thumb|Unemployment rate per country in 2013]]

This is a '''list of countries by unemployment rate'''. Methods of calculation and presentation of [[unemployment rate]] vary from country to country.
Some countries count insured unemployed only, some count those in receipt of welfare benefit only, some count the disabled and other permanently unemployable people, some countries count those who choose (and are financially able) not to work, supported by their spouses and caring for a family, some count students at college and so on. There may also be differences in the minimum requirements and some consider people employed even if only marginally associated with employment market (for example, working only one hour per week).&lt;ref name="Gallup-Unemployment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/189068/bls-unemployment-seasonally-adjusted.aspx|title=Real Unemployment -- Department of Labor (U-6)|work=Gallup|access-date=1 September 2017|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can be differences in the age limit. For example, [[Eurostat]] uses 15 to 74 years old when calculating unemployment rate, and the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] uses anyone 16 years of age or older (in both cases, people who are under education, retired, on maternity/paternity leave, prevented from working due to health, or do not work but have been inactive in seeking employment in the last four weeks are excluded from the [[workforce]], and therefore not counted as unemployed).&lt;ref name="Eurostat-unem"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Unemployment_statistics | title=Unemployment statistics | work=Eurostat | access-date=1 September 2017 | date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BLS-how"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm | title=Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey – How the Government Measures Unemployment | work=Bureau of Labor Statistics | access-date=1 September 2017 | date=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment rates are often [[seasonally adjusted]] to avoid variations that depend on time of year.&lt;ref name="Eurostat-unem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BLS-how"/&gt; [[List of countries by employment rate|Employment rate as a percentage of total population in working age]] is sometimes used instead of unemployment rate.

For purposes of comparison, harmonized values are published by [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) and by [[OECD]].
The ILO harmonized unemployment rate refers to those who are currently not working but are willing and able to work for pay, currently available to work, and have actively searched for work. The OECD harmonized unemployment rate gives the number of unemployed persons as a percentage of the labour force.

{{Windows XP}}

As the next version of [[Windows NT]] after [[Windows 2000]], as well as the successor to [[Windows Me]], [[Windows XP]] introduced many [[Features new to Windows XP|new features]] but it also removed some others. Following is a list of these.

==Shell==
* The unsafe device removal dialog was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/12/16/43890.aspx|title=The unsafe device removal dialog|last=Chen|first=Raymond|date=December 16, 2003|work=The Old New Thing|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Line Up Icons'' command on the [[Desktop environment|desktop]] is no longer available. It is replaced by the ''Align to Grid'' option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/293478 |title=Line Up Icons Command Is Missing on Windows XP Desktop |date=January 27, 2006 |work=Support |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=November 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214094553/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/293478 |archivedate=December 14, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this being a toggle, simply aligning desktop icons once without further constraining their placement requires an extra [[Point and click|click]].&lt;ref name="karp2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=Windows XP in a Nutshell|first1=David A.|last1=Karp|first2=Tim|last2=O'Reilly|first3=Troy|last3=Mott|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|location=Sebastopol, CA|year=2005|isbn=0596009003|accessdate=November 7, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5_UoYcmkvncC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|47}}
* The ''Minimize all windows'' command on the [[Taskbar#Microsoft Windows|taskbar]] is hidden.&lt;ref name="karp2005" /&gt;{{rp|76}} The purported replacement, ''Show the desktop'', co-existed with this feature on Windows 2000 and in any case only hides [[Window (computing)|windows]] temporarily instead of actually minimizing them. It is still accessible through the {{keypress|[[Windows key|Win]]|M}} [[keyboard shortcut]] but it is not available through the [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]].
* The ''Show icons using all possible colors'' option in ''Display Properties'' is no longer available. Icons are always shown using all possible colors. Microsoft states that this is by design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/282432 |title="Show icons using all possible colors" Option Is Not Available |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=January 15, 2006 |work=Support |accessdate=November 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112125824/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/282432 |archivedate=January 12, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[VGA]] [[screen resolution]] and [[color depth#8-bit color|8-bit color depth]] options have been removed from the ''Settings'' tab of ''Display Properties''. It is still possible to select these options using the ''Advanced'' button available under this tab, but Microsoft states that this workaround is unsupported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/286906 |title=Cannot Change Display Setting to 640 X 480 or 256 Color |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=January 15, 2006 |work=Support |accessdate=January 26, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219235217/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/286906 |archivedate=February 19, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[cmd.exe|Command Prompt]], ''QuickEdit mode'' and ''Insert mode'' are disabled by default and can only be re-enabled per window title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/282301 |title=Command Prompt QuickEdit Mode Is Disabled by Default in Windows XP |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=January 15, 2006 |work=Support |accessdate=January 26, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216132559/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/282301 |archivedate=December 16, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Links to ''Phone Dialer''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/285920 |title=Phone Dialer Is Not Available in the Communications Menu |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=January 15, 2006 |work=Support |accessdate=January 26, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312222148/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/285920 |archivedate=March 12, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NetMeeting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/298327 |title=NetMeeting Is Not Available on the Windows XP "Communications" Menu |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=January 25, 2006 |work=Support |accessdate=January 26, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208214314/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/298327 |archivedate=December 8, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; were removed from the [[Start menu]].

==Personalization==
* With the ''Desktop Themes'' utility in 2000 becoming the ''Themes'' tab in ''Display Properties'' in XP, the ''Rotate theme monthly'' option in ''Desktop Themes'', which was introduced in [[Microsoft Plus! 98]] and later included in Windows 2000, and both the options to select what parts of a theme to apply and the previews for parts of a theme were removed.
* It is no longer possible to save or delete schemes under the ''Appearance'' tab of ''Display Properties''.
* The option to select a ''Pattern'' under the ''Background'' (2000)/''Desktop'' (XP) tab of ''Display Properties'' was removed.
* The ''3D Maze'' (possibly due to the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[logo]] having been changed, although the [[Wingdings]] [[font]] with the old Windows logo is still present) and ''Channel Screen Saver'' [[screensaver]]s were removed. The ''3D Pipes'' [[teapot]] [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] also no longer works on Windows XP.

==Windows Explorer==

===Media Center Edition 2005===
* Despite [[Windows XP Media Center Edition|this edition]] being developed from [[Windows XP Professional]], [[Windows domain|domain]] support is unavailable. [[Microsoft]] states that this is due to [[Windows Media Center Extender]]s requiring [[fast user switching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/887212 |title=You cannot join your computer to a domain in Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=November 19, 2004 |work=Support |accessdate=November 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051101091747/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/887212 |archivedate=November 1, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exceptions to this are if it is selected during [[Installation (computer programs)|installation]] or already in use before an [[upgrade]], but leaving the domain will still disable the feature.

== Unconfirmed impact craters ==
{{main|List of unconfirmed impact craters on Earth}}
The following craters are officially considered "unconfirmed" because they are not listed in the Earth Impact Database.  Due to stringent requirements regarding evidence and peer-reviewed publication, newly discovered craters or those with difficulty collecting evidence generally are known for some time before becoming listed.  However, entries on the unconfirmed list could still have an impact origin disproven.

This list of [[impact crater]]s on [[Earth]] contains a selection of the 190 confirmed craters given in the [[Earth Impact Database]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.passc.net/EarthImpactDatabase/index.html |title=Earth Impact Database }}&lt;/ref&gt; To keep the lists manageable, only the largest craters within a time period are included. The [[List of impact craters on Earth#All craters listed alphabetically|complete list]] is divided into separate articles by geographical region.

==Confirmed impact craters listed by size and age==
These features were caused by the collision of meteors (consisting of large fragments of asteroids) or [[comets]] (consisting of ice, dust particles and rocky fragments) with the Earth. For eroded or buried craters, the stated diameter typically refers to the best available estimate of the original [[rim (craters)|rim]] diameter, and may not correspond to present surface features. Time units are either in [[Year#SI prefix multipliers|thousands]] ('''ka''') or [[Year#SI prefix multipliers|millions]] ('''Ma''') of years.

===Young craters (10 ka or less)===
Less than ten thousand years old, and with a diameter of 0.1&amp;nbsp;km (100 meters) or more. The EID lists only 7 or 8 such craters, and the largest in the last 100,000 years (100 ka) is the 4.5&amp;nbsp;km [[Rio Cuarto craters|Rio Cuarto crater]] in [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name=bland&gt;Bland, Phil A.; de Souza Filho, C.

For the Rio Cuarto craters, 2002 research suggests they may actually be [[Aeolian processes|aeolian]] structures.&lt;ref name=Cione2002&gt;Cione, Alberto L. et al. (2002). [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/moon/2002/00000091/00000001/05090331 Putative Meteoritic Craters in Río Cuarto (Central Argentina) Interpreted as Eolian Structures], ''Earth, Moon, and Planets'' '''91''' (1), 9-24.&lt;/ref&gt; The EID gives a size of about 50 meters for Campo del Cielo, but other sources quote 100 meters.&lt;ref name="Bobrowsky" /&gt;

===Large craters (10 ka to 1 Ma)===
From between 10 thousand years to 1 million years ago, and with a diameter of 1&amp;nbsp;km or more. The largest in the last one million years is the 14-km [[Zhamanshin crater]] in [[Kazakhstan]] and has been described as being capable of producing a [[nuclear winter|nuclear-like winter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unb.ca/passc/ImpactDatabase/essay.html Essay "Impact Cratering on Earth"], based on: Grieve, Richard A. F.; (1990); "Impact cratering on the Earth", ''Scientific American'', vol. 262, 66-73&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the currently unknown source of the enormous [[Australasian strewnfield]] (c. 780 [[kiloannum|ka]]) could be a crater about 100&amp;nbsp;km across.&lt;ref name="povenmire"&gt;Povenmire, Harold; Liu, W.; Xianlin, Luo; (1999) [http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/LPSC99/pdf/1072.pdf "Australasian tektites found in Guangxi Province, China"], in Proceedings of the 30th Annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, Houston, March 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glass1994"&gt;Glass, Billy P.; Pizzuto, James E.; (1994) [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994JGR....9919075G "Geographic variation in Australasian microtektite concentrations: Implications concerning the location and size of the source crater"], ''Journal of Geophysical Research'', vol. 99, no.

From between 1 and 10 million years ago, and with a diameter of 5&amp;nbsp;km or more. If uncertainties regarding its age are resolved, then the largest in the last 10 million years would be the 52-km [[Karakul (Tajikistan)#Impact crater|Karakul crater]] which is listed in EID with an age of less than 5 Ma, or the [[Pliocene]]. The large but apparently craterless [[Eltanin impact]] (2.5 Ma) into the [[Pacific Ocean]] has been suggested as contributing to the glaciations and cooling during the Pliocene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phys.org/news/2012-09-pacific-ocean-meteor-trigger-ice.html |title=Did a Pacific Ocean meteor trigger the Ice Age? |last=University of New South Wales |date=19 September 2012 |accessdate=8 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Largest craters}} Largest craters (10 Ma or more)===
Craters with a diameter of 20&amp;nbsp;km or more are all older than 10 Ma, with the exception of [[Karakul (Tajikistan)|Karakul]] (52 km) and the newly-discovered [[Hiawatha Glacier|Hiawatha crater]] (31 km, but not yet in the [[Earth Impact Database|EID]]) whose ages are uncertain. 

There are more than forty craters of such size. The largest two within the last hundred million years have been linked to two extinction events: [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub]] for the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous–Paleogene]] and the [[Popigai crater|Popigai impact]] for the [[Eocene–Oligocene extinction event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Russia's Popigai Meteor Crash Linked to Mass Extinction |url=http://www.livescience.com/46312-popigai-crater-linked-eocene-mass-extinction.html |date=13 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Note:''' A special case, the recently discovered [[Hiawatha Glacier|Hiawatha crater]] (31 km) in North-Eastern [[Greenland]], is not yet officially in the [[Earth Impact Database]] and is not large enough for this table. But if its age is indeed within the recent [[Pleistocene]], then it will be notable for its possible coeval and environmental effects.

==All craters listed alphabetically==
{{As of|2017}}, the [[Earth Impact Database]] (EID) contains '''190''' confirmed craters. The table below is arranged by the [[Continent#Area and population|continent's percentage of the Earth's land area]], and where Asian and Russian craters are grouped together per EID convention. The global distribution of known impact structures apparently shows a surprising asymmetry,&lt;ref name="Prezzi"&gt;Prezzi, Claudia B.; Orgeira, María Julia; Acevedo, Rogelio D.; Ponce, Juan Federico; Martinez, Oscar; Rabassa, Jorge O.; Corbella, Hugo; Vásquez, Carlos; González-Guillot, Mauricio; Subías, Ignacio; (2011); [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012PEPI..192...21P "Geophysical characterization of two circular structures at Bajada del Diablo (Patagonia, Argentina): Indication of impact origin"], ''Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors'', volume 192, p. 21-34&lt;/ref&gt; with the small but well-funded [[Europe]]an continent having a large percentage of confirmed craters. It is suggested this situation is an artifact, highlighting the importance of intensifying research in less studied areas like [[Antarctica]], [[South America]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Prezzi" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1003">The '''Master of Science in Organizational Leadership''' (MSOL) is a multidisciplinary [[master's degree]] in [[leadership studies]].

It is an alternative to, not a substitute for, the traditional [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) degree. The MSOL degree is multidisciplinary and focuses more on people and [[organizational design|organization issues]], and relatively less on business topics such as finance, accounting and marketing. (For example, the MSOL will offer courses in psychology and philosophy as well as courses in business and management.) Also, The MSOL degree is intended for those who are already established in a career, while, in contrast, those who are preparing to enter the world of work or change careers often seek an MBA degree. 

The MSOL degree is similar to the [[Master of Science in Leadership]] (MSL) degree and the Masters of Organizational Leadership (MAOL).

'''Ota Benga''' ({{circa|1883}}&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– March 20, 1916) was  an [[Mbuti people|Mbuti]] ([[Congo Pygmies|Congo pygmy]]) man,  known for being featured in an anthropology exhibit at the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in 1904, and in a [[human zoo]] exhibit in 1906 at the [[Bronx Zoo]]. Benga had been purchased from [[African slave trade]]rs by the missionary and anthropologist Samuel Phillips Verner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=John R.|title=Pioneer African Missionary: Samuel Phillips Verner|journal=Journal of Presbyterian History (1962-1985)|date=1982|volume=60|issue=1|pages=42–57|jstor=23328464}}&lt;/ref&gt; a businessman searching for African people for the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Caged in the human zoo: The shocking story of the young pygmy warrior put on show in a monkey house – and how he fuelled Hitler's twisted beliefs|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1224189/Caged-human-zoo-The-shocking-story-young-pygmy-warrior-monkey-house--fuelled-Hitlers-twisted-beliefs.html|accessdate=May 23, 2014|newspaper=Dailymail|date=October 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He traveled with Verner to the United States. At the Bronx Zoo, Benga had free run of the grounds before and after he was exhibited in the zoo's Monkey House. 
Except for a brief visit with Verner to Africa after the close of the St. Louis Fair, Benga lived in the United States, mostly in [[Virginia]], for the rest of his life.

[[African-American newspapers]] around the nation published editorials strongly opposing Benga's treatment. 
[[Robert Stuart MacArthur]], spokesman for a delegation of black churches, petitioned New York City Mayor [[George B. McClellan Jr.]] for his release from the Bronx Zoo. {{year needed|date=May 2018}}

In late 1906, the mayor released Benga to the custody of  James M. Gordon, who supervised the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum in Brooklyn. In 1910, Gordon arranged for Benga to be cared for in Virginia, where he paid for him to acquire American clothes and to have his teeth [[Dental restoration|capped]], so the young man could be more readily accepted in local society. 
Benga was tutored in English and began to work at a Lynchburg tobacco factory. He proved a valuable employee because he could climb up the poles to get the tobacco leaves without having to use a ladder.
He began to plan a return to Africa, but  the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 stopped ship passenger travel. 
Benga fell into a [[clinical depression|depression]], and he committed [[suicide]] in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evanzz|first=Karl|title=The Messenger: The rise and fall of Elijah Muhammad|year=1999|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|isbn=9780679442608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Early life===
As a member of the [[Mbuti]] people,&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume describe Benga as Mbuti and write, "A feature article described Ota Benga as 'a dwarfy, black specimen of sad-eyed humanity.' He was sad because the other pygmies were Batwa but he was not..." (p. 116). They later mention that he "never fully assimilated into the Batwa" during his time with them. Parezo and Fowler refer to "[t]he Mbuti (Batwa) Pygmies and 'Red Africans'" and note that "McGee called them all Batwa Pygmies, 'real aboriginals of the Dark Continent'&amp;nbsp;... [Benga] was slightly taller than the other Pygmies, a characteristic common to his society, the Badinga or Chiri-chiri. Verner considered the Chiri-chiris a Pygmy society, and McGee and the press decided not to quibble over details." (pp. 200–203). Many sources, e.g. Adams (p. 25) and [[NPR]], simply describe him as "a Batwa Pygmy from Africa".&lt;/ref&gt; Ota Benga lived in equatorial forests near the [[Kasai River]] in what was then the [[Congo Free State]]. 
His people were attacked by the ''[[Force Publique]],'' established by [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II of Belgium]] as a militia to control the natives for labor in order to exploit the large supply of [[rubber]] in the Congo.  
Benga's wife and two children were murdered; he survived only because he was on a hunting expedition when the Force Publique attacked his village. He was later captured by "Baschelel" ([[Bashilele]]) slave traders.&lt;ref&gt;name="nyt2006"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="National Public Radio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Looking Back at the Strange Case of Ota Benga|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6225825|website=NPR.org|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=27 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt2006"/&gt;

American businessman and explorer Samuel Phillips Verner travelled to Africa in 1904 under contract from the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] (St. Louis World Fair) to bring back an assortment of pygmies to be part of an exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt; To demonstrate the fledgling discipline of [[anthropology]], the noted scientist [[W. J. McGee]] intended to display "representatives of all the world's peoples, ranging from smallest pygmies to the most gigantic peoples, from the darkest blacks to the dominant whites" to show what was commonly thought then to be a sort of [[Scientific racism|cultural evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Bradford and Blume (1992), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Verner discovered Ota Benga while 'en route' to a [[Twa peoples|Batwa]] village visited previously; he negotiated Benga's release from the slave traders for a pound of salt and a bolt of cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt; Verner later claimed Benga was rescued from the cannibals by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/336335-ota-benga-caged-pygmy/|title=100 years ago today, Ota Benga ended his horrible life after caged as 'pygmy' at Bronx Zoo|website=RT International|language=en-EN|access-date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two spent several weeks together before reaching the village. There the villagers had developed distrust for the ''muzungu'' (white man) due to the abuses of King Leopold's forces. Verner was unable to recruit any villagers to join him until Benga spoke of the ''muzungu'' saving his life, the bond that had grown between them, and his own curiosity about the world Verner came from. Four Batwa, all male, ultimately accompanied them. Verner recruited other Africans who were not pygmies: five men from the [[Kuba Kingdom|Bakuba]], including the son of King Ndombe, ruler of the Bakuba, and other related peoples&amp;nbsp;– "Red Africans" as they were collectively labeled by contemporary anthropologists.&lt;ref name="parezo204"&gt;Parezo and Fowler (2007), p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As exhibit===

====St. Louis World Fair====
[[File:Louisiana Purchase pygmies.jpg|thumb|Benga (second from left) and the Batwa in St. Louis]]
The group was brought to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in late June 1904 without Verner, who had been taken ill with [[malaria]]. The Louisiana Purchase Exposition had already begun, and the Africans immediately became the center of attention. Ota Benga was particularly popular, and his name was reported variously by the press as ''Artiba'', ''Autobank'',&lt;ref name="Bradford Geronimo"&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 12–16.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ota Bang'', and ''Otabenga''. He had an amiable personality, and visitors were eager to see his teeth, which had been [[human tooth sharpening|filed to sharp points]] in his early youth as ritual decoration. The Africans learned to charge for photographs and performances. One newspaper account, promoting Ota Benga as "the only genuine African [[cannibal]] in America", claimed "[his teeth were] worth the five cents he charges for showing them to visitors".&lt;ref name="parezo204" /&gt;

When Verner arrived a month later, he realized the pygmies were more prisoners than performers. Their attempts to congregate peacefully in the forest on Sundays were thwarted by the crowds' fascination with them. McGee's attempts to present a "serious" scientific exhibit were also overturned. On July 28, the Africans' performing to the crowd's preconceived notion that they were "savages" resulted in the First Illinois Regiment being called in to control the mob. Benga and the other Africans eventually performed in a warlike fashion, imitating [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] they saw at the Exhibition.&lt;ref name="Verner arrive"&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 118–121&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Apache]] chief [[Geronimo]] (featured as "The Human Tyger"&amp;nbsp;– with special dispensation from the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]])&lt;ref name="Bradford Geronimo" /&gt; grew to admire Benga, and gave him one of his [[arrowhead]]s. For his efforts, Verner was awarded the gold medal in anthropology at the close of the Exposition.&lt;ref name="Verner arrive" /&gt;

====American Museum of Natural History====
Benga accompanied Verner when he returned the other Africans to the Congo. He briefly lived amongst the Batwa while continuing to accompany Verner on his African adventures. He married a Batwa woman who later died of snakebite, and little is known of this second marriage. Not feeling that he belonged with the Batwa, Benga chose to return with Verner to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 151–158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Verner eventually arranged for Benga to stay in a spare room at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City while he was tending to other business.  Verner negotiated with the curator Henry Bumpus over the presentation of his acquisitions from Africa and potential employment. While Bumpus was put off by Verner's request of the prohibitively high salary of $175 a month and was not impressed with the man's credentials, he was interested in Benga. Wearing a Southern-style linen suit to entertain visitors, Benga initially enjoyed his time at the museum. He became homesick, however.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 159–168.&lt;/ref&gt;

The writers Bradford and Blume imagined his feelings:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What at first held his attention now made him want to flee. It was maddening to be inside&amp;nbsp;– to be swallowed whole&amp;nbsp;– so long. He had an image of himself, stuffed, behind glass, but somehow still alive, crouching over a fake campfire, feeding meat to a lifeless child. Museum silence became a source of torment, a kind of noise; he needed birdsong, breezes, trees.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 165–166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The disaffected Benga attempted to find relief by exploiting his employers' presentation of him as a 'savage'. He tried to slip past the guards as a large crowd was leaving the premises; when asked on one occasion to seat a wealthy donor's wife, he pretended to misunderstand, instead hurling the chair across the room, just missing the woman's head. Meanwhile, Verner was struggling financially and had made little progress in his negotiations with the museum. He soon found another home for Benga.&lt;ref name ="museum" /&gt;

====Bronx Zoo====
At the suggestion of Bumpus, Verner took Benga to the [[Bronx Zoo]] in 1906. [[William Temple Hornaday|William Hornaday]], director of the zoo, initially hired Benga to use as help in maintaining the animal habitats. However, Hornaday saw that people took more notice of Benga than the animals at the zoo, eventually making Hornaday create an exhibition to feature Benga.&lt;ref name="National Public Radio"/&gt; There, the Mbuti man was allowed to roam the grounds freely. He became fond of an [[orangutan]] named Dohong, "the presiding genius of the Monkey House", who had been taught to perform tricks and imitate human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 172–174.&lt;/ref&gt; The events leading to his "exhibition" alongside Dohong were gradual:&lt;ref name="nyt2006"&gt;
{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benga spent some of his time in the Monkey House exhibit, and the zoo encouraged him to hang his [[hammock]] there, and to shoot his bow and arrow at a target. On the first day of the exhibit, September 8, 1906, visitors found Benga in the Monkey House.&lt;ref name="nyt2006"/&gt; Soon, a sign on the exhibit read:

[[File:Ota Benga at Bronx Zoo.jpg|thumb|Ota Benga at the Bronx Zoo in 1906. Only five promotional photos exist of Benga's time here, none of them in the "Monkey House"; cameras were not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), photo insert.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;The African Pygmy, "Ota Benga."&lt;br /&gt;
Age, 23 years. Height, 4 feet 11 inches.&lt;br /&gt;
Weight, 103 pounds. Brought from the&lt;br /&gt;
Kasai River, Congo Free State, South Cen-&lt;br /&gt;
tral Africa, by Dr. Samuel P. Verner. Ex-&lt;br /&gt;
hibited each afternoon during September.&lt;ref name="nyt1906"&gt;"Man and Monkey Show Disapproved by Clergy," ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 10, 1906, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hornaday considered the exhibit a valuable spectacle for visitors; he was supported by [[Madison Grant]], Secretary of the [[New York Zoological Society]], who lobbied to put Ota Benga on display alongside apes at the Bronx Zoo.  A decade later, Grant became prominent nationally as a [[scientific racism|racial anthropologist]] and [[eugenics|eugenicist]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 173–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[African-American]] clergymen immediately protested to zoo officials about the exhibit. Said James H. Gordon,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our race, we think, is depressed enough, without exhibiting one of us with the apes ... We think we are worthy of being considered human beings, with souls."&lt;ref name="nyt2006"/&gt;  Gordon thought the exhibit was hostile to Christianity and a promotion of [[Darwinism]]: "The Darwinian theory is absolutely opposed to Christianity, and a public demonstration in its favor should not be permitted.&lt;ref name="nyt2006"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A number of clergymen backed Gordon.&lt;ref name="Spiro 47"&gt;Spiro (2008), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In defense of the depiction of Benga as a lesser human, an editorial in  ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We do not quite understand all the emotion which others are expressing in the matter ... It is absurd to make moan over the imagined humiliation and degradation Benga is suffering. The pygmies ... are very low in the human scale, and the suggestion that Benga should be in a school instead of a cage ignores the high probability that school would be a place ... from which he could draw no advantage whatever. The idea that men are all much alike except as they have had or lacked opportunities for getting an education out of books is now far out of date.&lt;ref name="Spiro 48"&gt;Spiro (2008), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the controversy, Benga was allowed to roam the grounds of the zoo. In response to the situation, as well as verbal and physical prods from the crowds, he became more mischievous and somewhat violent.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1998). See chapter on Ota Benga.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Around this time, an article in ''The New York Times'' stated, "It is too bad that there is not some society like the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. We send our missionaries to Africa to Christianize the people, and then we bring one here to brutalize him."&lt;ref name="nyt1906" /&gt;

The zoo finally removed Benga from the grounds. Verner was unsuccessful in his continued search for employment, but he occasionally spoke to Benga. The two had agreed that it was in Benga's best interests to remain in the United States despite the unwelcome spotlight at the zoo.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 187–190.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Toward the end of 1906, Benga was released into Reverend Gordon's custody.&lt;ref name="nyt2006" /&gt;

===Later life===
Gordon placed Benga in the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum, a church-sponsored [[orphanage]] which he supervised. 
As the unwelcome press attention continued, in January 1910, Gordon arranged for Benga's relocation to [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], where he lived with the McCray family.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 191–204.&lt;/ref&gt; So that Benga could more easily be part of local society, Gordon arranged for the African's teeth to be capped and bought him American-style clothes. Tutored by Lynchburg poet [[Anne Spencer]],&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 212–213.&lt;/ref&gt; Benga could improve his English, and he began to attend elementary school at the Baptist Seminary in Lynchburg.&lt;ref name="Spiro 48" /&gt;

Once he felt his English had improved sufficiently, Benga discontinued his formal education. He began working at a Lynchburg [[tobacco]] factory. He proved a valuable employee because he could climb up the poles to get the tobacco leaves without having to use a ladder. His fellow workers called him "Bingo".  He often told his life story in exchange for sandwiches and root beer. He began to plan a return to Africa.&lt;ref name="Spiro 49"&gt;Spiro (2008), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914 when [[World War I]] broke out, a return to the Congo became impossible as passenger ship traffic ended. Benga became depressed as his hopes for a return to his homeland faded.&lt;ref name="Spiro 49" /&gt; On March 20, 1916, at the age of 32, he built a ceremonial fire, chipped off the caps on his teeth, and shot himself in the heart with a stolen pistol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Benga_Ota_ca_1883-1916 "Ota Benga"], ''Encyclopedia Virginia''&lt;/ref&gt;

He was buried in an unmarked grave in the black section of the [[Old City Cemetery (Lynchburg, Virginia)|Old City Cemetery]], near his benefactor, Gregory Hayes. At some point, the remains of both men went missing.  Local oral history indicates that Hayes and Ota Benga were eventually moved from the Old Cemetery to White Rock Cemetery, a burial ground that later fell into disrepair.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Phillips Verner Bradford, the grandson of Samuel Phillips Verner, wrote a book on the Mbuti man, entitled ''Ota Benga: The Pygmy in the Zoo'' (1992). During his research for the book, Bradford visited the [[American Museum of Natural History]], which holds a life mask and body cast of Ota Benga. The display is still labeled "Pygmy", rather than indicating Benga's name, despite objections beginning a century ago from Verner and repeated by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Darrel |last=Laurent |url=http://www.newsadvance.com/news/local/ |title=Demeaned in Life, Forgotten in Death |publisher=The Lynchburg News &amp; Advance |date=May 29, 2005 |accessdate=2006-04-03 }}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publication of Bradford's book in 1992 inspired widespread interest in Ota Benga's story and stimulated creation of many other works, both fictional and non-fiction, such as:

* 1994 – John Strand's play, ''Ota Benga'', was produced by the Signature Theater in [[Arlington, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.broadwayplaypubl.com/otabenga.htm |title=''Ota Benga'' |publisher=Broadway Plays |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817192756/http://www.broadwayplaypubl.com/OTABENGA.htm |archivedate=August 17, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1997 – The play, ''Ota Benga, Elegy for the Elephant,'' by Dr. Ben B. Halm, was staged at [[Fairfield University]] in Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairfield.edu/pr_memdetails1.html|title=Memorial details&amp;nbsp;— Ben Halm|publisher=Fairfield University|accessdate=2009-01-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071102145744/http://www.fairfield.edu/pr_memdetails1.html |archivedate = November 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2002 – The Mbuti man was the subject of the short documentary, ''Ota Benga: A Pygmy in America,'' directed by Brazilian [[Alfeu França]]. He incorporated original movies recorded by Verner in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |title=Ota Benga:A Pygmy in America |people=Alfeu França |date=2002 |medium=film}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2005 – A fictionalized account of his life portrayed in the film ''[[Man to Man (2005 film)|Man to Man]]'', starring Joseph Fiennes, Kristin Scott Thomas.

Leonardi moved to UCSB to found the [[Technology Management Program]] and start its [[Master of Technology Management]] and Ph.D. programs. Before joining UCSB, Leonardi was a faculty member in the School of Communication, the McCormick School of Engineering, and the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.

Leonardi’s research focuses on how companies can design their organizational networks and implement new technologies to more effectively create and share knowledge. He is particularly interested in how data intensive technologies, such as simulation and social media tools, enable new ways to access, store, and share information; how the new sources of information these technologies provide can change work routines and communication partners; and how shifts in employees’ work and communication alter the nature of an organization's expertise. His work on these topics cuts across the fields of [[Organization Studies]], [[Communication Studies]], and [[Information Systems]] and has been published in leading journals in these fields, such as ''[[Academy of Management Journal]]'', ''[[Academy of Management Review]]'', ''[[Journal of Communication]]'', ''[[Human Communication Research]]'', ''[[Information Systems Research]]'',  ''[[MIS Quarterly]]'', and ''[[Organization Science (journal)|Organization Science]].'' He is also the author of three books ''[[Car Crashes Without Cars: Lessons About Simulation Technology and Organizational Change from Automotive Design]]'' (2012, MIT Press), ''[[Materiality and Organizing: Social Interaction in a Technological World]]''(2012, Oxford University Press), and ''[[Technology Choices: Why Occupations Differ in Their Embrace of New Technologies]]'' (2015, MIT Press).

'''''Phylo''''' is an experimental [[video game]] about [[multiple sequence alignment]] optimisation.&lt;ref name="plosone"/&gt; Developed by the [[McGill University|McGill]] Centre for Bioinformatics, it was originally released as a free [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] game in November 2010. Designed as a [[game with a purpose]], players solve pattern-matching puzzles that represent [[nucleotide sequence]]s of different phylogenetic [[taxa]] to optimize alignments over a computer algorithm. By aligning together each nucleotide sequence, represented as differently coloured blocks, players attempt to create the highest point value score for each set of sequences by matching as many colours as possible and minimizing gaps.

The nucleotide sequences generated by ''Phylo'' are obtained from actual sequence data from the [[UCSC Genome Browser]]. High-scoring player alignments are collected as data and sent back to the McGill Centre for Bioinformatics to be further evaluated with a stronger scoring algorithm. Those player alignments that score higher than the current computer-generated score will be re-introduced into the global alignment as an optimization.

==Background==
{{see also|Multiple sequence alignment}}
The goal of multiple sequence alignments in [[phylogenetics]] is to determine the most likely nucleotide sequence of each species by comparing the sequences of children species with those of a [[most recent common ancestor]]. Producing such an optimal multiple sequence alignment is usually determined with a dynamic programming algorithm that finds the most probable evolutionary outcome by minimizing the number of [[mutation]]s required. These algorithms generate [[phylogenetic trees]] for each nucleotide in a sequence for each species, and determine the genetic sequence for a common ancestor by comparing the trees of the child species. The algorithms then score and sort the completed phylogenetic tree, and the alignment with the [[maximum parsimony]] score is determined to be the optimal, and thus most evolutionarily likely, multiple sequence alignment. However, finding such an optimal alignment for a large number of sequences has been determined to be an [[NP-complete]] problem.

''Phylo'' uses [[human-based computation]] to create an [[interactive genetic algorithm]] to solve the multiple sequence alignment problem instead. Generation of the ancestral sequences and parsimony scoring is still computed using a variation of the [[Fitch algorithm]], but ''Phylo'' abstracts the genetic sequences obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser into a pattern-matching game, allowing human players to suggest the most likely alignment rather than algorithmically considering all possible trees.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Phylo screenshot.png|thumb|250 px|A screenshot of ''Phylo'', with eight sequence alignments to be matched and scored.]]
Each puzzle in ''Phylo'' is categorized based on the number of total sequence fragments to be aligned and a disease that is associated with that fragment in humans. Once a puzzle is chosen, a few of the genetic sequence fragments for each species to be aligned, represented as coloured blocks, are each placed on a single row of a grid. Each nucleotide of a genetic sequence fragment is free to move along the grid. Players can then adjust the sequences as necessary in order to create the largest number of colour matches in each column between them, while minimizing the number of the gaps that appear.

Scoring of the sequence alignment is done by comparing each of the player-aligned sequences with an algorithm-determined ancestral sequence generated at each node. A colour match yields +1 to the score, a mismatch yields -1, an opening of a gap yields -5, and an extension of any existing gap yields -1. The sum of all comparisons is then determined every several seconds, which provides the final score for that player's alignment. For each puzzle, only a few sequences are initially available at the beginning of the game. A computer-determined par score must be beaten by the player before moving on to the next round and unlocking more sequences to match. A player wins and is allowed to submit their sequence alignment to the database by matching or surpassing the final par score generated by the computer for each puzzle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24907">The '''Program on Information Resources Policy (PIRP)''' was a research program at [[Harvard University]], sometimes referred to informally as "Harvard’s think tank on the information age."  See &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pirp.harvard.edu/about/&lt;/ref&gt; for a complete explanation.
It was established on February 1, 1973 by [[Anthony Oettinger]] and John LeGates and closed on June 30, 2011 by the same principals. It worked in the realm of communications and information resources. At most points in its history it employed as many as 15 full time staffers, mostly professionals, as well as hosting scores of visiting scholars and sponsored researchers over the years. At any given time it was supported by about 100 different public and private organizations.

During the 1980s the principals of PIRP, in addition to Oettinger and LeGates, included John F. McLaughin, who headed areas of postal policy as well as national security issues; [http://www.compaine.com Benjamin Compaine], who directed areas of the media and literacy; and Oswald H. Ganley, who focused on international issues such as transborder data flows.

As is typical for an academic program, it offered courses and seminars, but it also produced more than 500 book-length reports, most after reviews from industry, government and academia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pirp.harvard.edu/about/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; However, its principal goal was to aid industry, government and public decision makers with sound reasoning and with information that was both impartial and competent. For that mission it developed research and dissemination methods that were innovative and unique.

==How the program worked==
In the words of the Program:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pirp.harvard.edu/about/nutshell.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
* We deal mainly with controversial matters of continuing relevance.
* We work on emerging issues in the middle time range—a focus close enough for the issues to be of concern to real stakeholders and remote enough for outcomes to be open.
* We lay out the essentials of controversies but do not take sides, make recommendations, or attempt to predict the future.
* We forego relationships that might bias us—such as consulting, partisan expert testimony, or membership on corporate boards.
* We operate with diversified financial support from stakeholders in the controversies worked on.
* Our work is reviewed by these stakeholders and by members of the relevant professions and disciplines.
* All our work is available to the public. Everyone knows in advance that this is so.
* Our work is neither proprietary nor classified. We neither work toward external deadlines nor respond to requests for proposals (RFPs).
* We aspire to intellectual, financial, and institutional stability regardless of the ins and outs of fashions and incumbencies.

The Program held itself as being both impartial &lt;ref&gt;http://pirp.harvard.edu/about/impartiality.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; and competent.&lt;ref&gt;http://pirp.harvard.edu/about/competence.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it worked in areas of contentious policy debates, from its founding the Principals were concerned about the perception that, for many researchers, accepting funding from a particular interest could taint the findings of the research, no matter how impartial the authors claimed to be. To address this concern, Oettinger and LeGates devised a funding plan that sought small sums from many competing stakeholders in the information industries. "Being bought by everybody, we are bought by nobody," is how they explained this model.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pirp.harvard.edu/about/mission.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; All operations were funded by "Affiliates" that provided contributions, usually on an annual basis, that went into a blended "pot." The Principals made the determination what research to undertake, aiming to build knowledge for use when and where it’s needed. It never accepted funds from any source that would be designated for a specific research project. Whether a contributing affiliate or not, "We do not take sides—in any form. We are in the business of description, not prescription. We map the territory—you position your forces." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pirp.harvard.edu/about/impartiality.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

To address the goal of competence, PIRP established process of continuous fact-finding and written analysis. It created a "vetting" procedure for all its published research. A first draft would be circulated among Affiliates as well as outsiders who might have relevant expertise. Among the questions they were typically asked might be: Do we have the facts straight? Have we presented the position of your industry or your agency accurately? Have we unearthed the critical controversies?&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pirp.harvard.edu/about/competence.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

The Program's primary avenue for disseminating its research was through its approximately 500 publications. Most were extensively reviewed by both disciplinary experts and by stakeholders in the topics under discussion. Full texts of almost all are available on the Program website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pirp.harvard.edu/publications/&lt;/ref&gt;

However, PIRP's objective was to make the information it developed available to decision makers in real time. This was most often accomplished by  face–to-face meetings, usually with senior people in the affiliates. One customary format would be for the affiliate to describe its major uncertainties. The Program's Principal's would respond with whatever they knew that might be relevant. The hoped-for result, if any, would be better information and thinking for the affiliate. Although Program Principals did not sign nondisclosure agreements, it assured those with whom they met confidentiality.&lt;ref&gt;http://pirp.harvard.edu/about/confidentiality.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Program Principals also disseminated its findings and analysis through testimony and presentations, when requested, to Federal and state policymakers as well as in other public forums.

==Financial supporters/work affiliates==
Over its career, the Program was supported at one time or another by about 400 organizations, called "Affiliates". They included industry players, government agencies, non-profit organizations, trade associations and advocacy groups in the U.S., Canada and globally. It worked closely with those and many others.  Here is the complete list over the 38 years of its operations:

==Reviews and compliments==
The impact of the Program is hard to measure directly: How can it be determined that organizations made better decisions? One metric would the breadth and continuity of the financial support (see list of affiliates). Another would be quotable feedback and praise from the people with whom the program worked. Here are some samples. (A longer list is at.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pirp.harvard.edu/about/compliments.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;) :

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In my view, you and your group are more significant than anyone else in the information age turning out so well.
'''Ivan Seidenberg,''' Chairman and CEO, Verizon, 2012
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
My Federal Agency is only a year old as of yesterday, but it owes some of the impetus for its formation to spade work begun by Mr. Oettinger, Mr. LeGates and your colleagues for the past several years.... Your Program has also been a source of important substantive ideas and insights. I myself have cribbed shamelessly.... '''Ambassador John E. Reinhardt,''' Director, International Communications Agency, 1979
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I wish I had discovered this place two years ago before I went to the FCC. I'm sure I could have had two more productive years had I had a chance to talk to you beforehand. '''[[Anne Jones (public servant)|Anne Jones]],''' Commissioner, Federal Communications Commission, 1981
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You are like a breath of fresh air blowing through a miasma of hot air, which permeates the national dialogue on telephony. You are the only one I have met in the last fourteen years…who understands the situation, articulates it, and does so without prejudice. '''Edward P. Larkin,''' Chairman, New York Public Service Commission, 1984
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the course of its work on developing the JCS bill, the Investigations Subcommittee, which I chair, has benefited significantly from the studies authored by retired General J. H. Cushman. I understand that the Program on Information Resources Policy has sponsored General Cushman’s work, and commend you for supporting a project that is having an immediate, constructive impact as the Congress frames the future structure of the defense establishment. '''Congressman Bill Nichols''', 1985
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Program on Information Resources Policy, through its independent and incisive analyses, free from special interest and partisan considerations, has helped me and my predecessors cut through the noise and get to the bottom of important public policy issues in the communications and information field. Over the years, the Harvard Program has become an indispensable institution on which policymakers in both the public and private sector have come to depend for truthful and fearless advice, even if its views have run sometimes counter to popular or conventional wisdom. For a Congressman to deal with people who are in fact impartial and competent is a rare experience. I recognize this program and your work as being critical to the development of sound telecommunications policy, and I support your continued efforts to examine these important issues. '''Congressman [[Edward J. Markey]],''' Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, 1991
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This chapter is the most succinct and analytical source yet available for elucidating local distribution policy, planning, and marketing. '''[[Journal of Communication]]''' 1985
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(Longstaff’s draft is) the best thing I ever read in the field. I need another copy. Senator McCain is reading it and won’t let it go. '''[[John McCain]]/Mark Buse,''' Senator John McCain’s office, 1995
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Your work is a distinguished contribution not only to the world of research and to your university, but to all of us whose life is caught up in the business of communication. '''Robert D. Lilley,''' President, American Telephone and Telegraph Company, 1974
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Last week’s conference was the finest I have ever attended. '''John R. Bennett,''' President, Transamerica Information Services, 1977
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We are appreciative of the constructive work that you have been doing, particularly in the postal arena, and we certainly hope that you will continue to contribute to clearer thinking about the Postal Service here in this country. '''Kent Rhodes,''' Chairman, Reader's Digest, 1978
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Your center is a gold mine of information—and I very much appreciate your thoughtfulness in filling up my reading file with such helpful and insightful materials. '''"You could have used my name if you hadn’t asked"''', Executive Office of the President, 1990
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Your chart of information industries revenues will save us and our consultants many hundreds of hours of labor. I am especially grateful for your willingness to send a handwritten table prior to publication—we will guard it with our lives. '''Charles M. Oliver,''' Director, Legislative and Regulatory Policy, CBS, Inc., 1981
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I want both of you to know that our luncheon session last month and your follow-on work paid big dividends for us. '''George H. Bolling,''' Vice President, Advanced Programs, COMSAT, 1990
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is no trace of the mindless pap which passes as "debate on regulation." '''Media Information Australia''', 1985
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Have now read the C3I paper. Absolutely fascinating, and very useful to me in preparing a speech I hope to make on the SDI program later this week. The quality of the discussion was quite exceptional, and kept me reading all weekend! '''[[Sir Ian Lloyd]], M.P.,''' House of Commons, U.K., Chairman: All parties Committee on Communications Technology, 1986
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Program is in our view the pre-eminent honest broker in the massive job of keeping track of what is happening to, and within, the industry that comprises the means of moving information from place to place. '''John Morgan,''' Assistant to Executive Vice President, Communications Workers of America, 1981
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is no question at all that Washington looks at your work as an outside expert of very high credibility. I see your testimony reflected in their decisions as well as hearing about you in their discussions. Your work and your role are excellent. '''William Ditch,''' American District Telegraph Corporation, 1981
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
David Charlton was very high in praise for you as the highest quality effort he has ever come in contact with. '''Frank Kapper,''' Corning, Inc., 1989
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am amazed at the religious fervor with which Apple is using your map. I was handed it as background reading for my meeting with Sculley, Chairman and Nagle, Chief Scientist. They said “this may take you a while”. '''John Schwartz,''' Newsweek (reporter), 1993
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Reconstructing Womanhood: The Emergence of the Afro-American Woman Novelist''' ({{ISBN|0-19-506071-7}}), published in 1987, is a [[book]] by [[Hazel Carby]] which centers on [[slavery|slave]] narratives by women.

Carby received her [[Ph.D.]] in 1984 from [[Birmingham University]]. Her [[doctoral dissertation]] later became the foundation for the book. Reconstructing Womanhood analyzes writings from black women in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as well as examines the social, political, and historical landscapes in which these works were produced. Carby wrote the book with four major aims:

*To examine how [[black people|black]] women [[writer]]s and [[orator]]s dealt with the exclusionary practices of domestic and literary ideals of womanhood in nineteenth century [[white people|white]] society; and how black female [[intellectual]]s transformed and reconstructed these [[ideology|ideologies]] to produce their own definitions of true womanhood.
*To expose the lack of significant [[political alliance]]s between black and white women during the nineteenth century. Further, in terms of contemporary [[feminism]] and [[literary criticism]], Carby argues that white women were more inclined to show allegiance to [[Race (human categorization)|race]] instead of gender by allying themselves not with black women, but with the dominant white male [[patriarchy]].
*To identify the societal contributions of black women in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries during a period of intense intellectual activity and productivity deemed the “black women’s renaissance”.
*To serve as a [[literary history]] chronicling the emergence of black female [[novel]]ists and the historical contexts in which they wrote.

{{plain image with caption|setiQuest logo.png|align=right|width=150px|The logo of setiQuest}}

'''setiQuest''' is an inactive project of the [[SETI Institute]], whose declared aim is to "globalize the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence and empower a new generation of SETI enthusiasts",{{#tag:ref|"Getting individuals involved is key to the project, not just to process data, but to get people emotionally and intellectually invested in the mission and lend a new perspective on the world around us, Tarter said."&lt;ref name="cbs"/&gt;|group=note}}{{#tag:ref|"The aim would be to tap into the power of open-source initiatives, to globalize the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence and empower a new generation of SETI enthusiasts."&lt;ref name="TED"/&gt;|group=note}} by creating means for a deeper involvement from the interested public.&lt;ref name="website"&gt;{{cite web |title = setiQuest Info Page |url = http://wiki.setiquest.info/index.php/Main_Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project focuses on amplifying the human potential of SETI enthusiasts, and consists of four main fronts: Software, DSP Algorithms, Citizen Scientists, and Data release. Although there is no present activity on setiQuest per-se, much of the code and raw data products are still available on its successor site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = setiQuest Info |url = http://wiki.setiquest.info/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jill Tarter's TED wish ==
The setiQuest project started with Jill Tarter's "TED wish". Tarter was one of three recipients of the 2009 [[TED Conference#TED Prize|TED prize]], which targets outstanding individuals and tries to grant them "one wish to change the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tedprize.org/ TED Prize : Wishes Big Enough to Change the World]&lt;/ref&gt; Tarter's wish was:

{{cquote|I wish that you would empower Earthlings everywhere to become active participants in the ultimate search for cosmic company.&lt;ref name="TED"&gt;{{cite web |title = TED Prize: Jill Tarter |url = http://www.tedprize.org/jill-tarter/ |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090209230126/http://www.tedprize.org/jill-tarter/ |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 2009-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the award, the project materialized through a website,&lt;ref name="website"/&gt; that later garnered grass-roots public involvement on its discussion forum, and also in [[IRC]] meetings, various social networks, and a wiki. Some of these channels were set up by the community itself, and others were facilitated through the support of several institutions, in cooperation with the SETI Institute.

== Software ==
The [[software]] aspect of the project initially entailed [[Open-source software|opening the source code]] of SonATA, the software used on the [[Allen Telescope Array]] (ATA), into [[Open SonATA]], to allow improvement by hobbyist programmers who are passionate about the subject or enjoy contributing to open source code development projects. To further this goal, setiQuest was accepted as part of the [[Google Summer of Code]] 2011 program.{{CN|date=June 2018}}

== DSP Algorithms ==
The Algorithms subproject provides a channel for the creation of improved [[Digital signal processing]] (DSP) algorithms for detection of signals in the background noise captured by the ATA. The algorithms used on the ATA currently only search for continuous wave signals (that is, signals that appear at one frequency as a single tone) or pulsed signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = setiQuest ATA Data and Algorithms |url = http://wiki.setiquest.info/index.php/Main_Page }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this participation mode was to allow signal processing enthusiasts to expand the search to other waveforms, perform improvements in the current algorithms or propose innovative new ones.

== Citizen Scientists ==
setiQuest also targets those who are less technically inclined, through the development of game-like apps to engage participants as Citizen Scientists, examining real data from SETI observations with the Allen Telescope Array. These apps were meant to harness the ability of the human brain to instinctively [[Pattern recognition (psychology)|detect patterns]], even in non-trivial cases where automated tools currently fail. The first of such apps, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140723035900/http://explorer.setiquest.org/  setiQuest Explorer] was released in March 2011.&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;{{cite news |title = SETI taps smartphones in hunt for E.T. |url = http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501465_162-20041528-501465.html |work = CBS News |first = Elinor |last = Mills |date = 10 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = SETI app taps your smartphone to hunt for E.T. |url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-20041365-245.html#ixzz1JLprpK6b }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = SETI Explorer App Finally Gives your Phone a Purpose |url = http://techland.time.com/2011/03/10/seti-explorer-app-finally-gives-your-phone-a-purpose/#ixzz1JLr7BxN7 |work = Time |date = 10 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data release ==
To encourage developers to create new apps, the SETI Institute has made a large amount of its data available to the public, under a [[Creative Commons]] 3.0 license.

[[Ray Solomonoff]]'s theory of universal '''inductive inference''' is a theory of prediction based on logical observations, such as predicting the next symbol based upon a given series of symbols. The only assumption that the theory makes is that the environment follows some unknown but [[Computable function|computable]] [[probability distribution]]. It is a mathematical formalization of [[Occam's razor]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;JJ McCall. Induction: From Kolmogorov and Solomonoff to De Finetti and Back to Kolmogorov – Metroeconomica, 2004 – Wiley Online Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;D Stork.

On the existence and convergence of computable universal priors [https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0305052 arxiv.org] – Algorithmic Learning Theory, 2003 – Springer&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Principle of Multiple Explanations]].&lt;ref name="Paul Vitanyi p 339"&gt;Ming Li and Paul Vitanyi, ''An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications.''  Springer-Verlag, N.Y., 2008p 339 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prediction is done using a completely [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] framework. The [[universal prior]] is calculated for all computable sequences—this is the universal a priori probability distribution;
no computable hypothesis will have a [[zero probability]]. This means that Bayes rule of causation can be used in predicting the continuation of any particular computable sequence.

==Origin==

===Philosophical===
The theory is based in philosophical foundations, and was founded by [[Ray Solomonoff]] around 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Rathmanner and [[Marcus Hutter]]. A philosophical treatise of universal induction. Entropy, 13(6):1076–1136, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It is a mathematically formalized combination of [[Occam's razor]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hernandez.1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutter.2003"/&gt; and the [[Principle of Multiple Explanations]].&lt;ref name="Paul Vitanyi p 339"/&gt;
All [[computable]] theories which perfectly describe previous observations are used to calculate the probability of the next observation, with more weight put on the shorter computable theories. Marcus Hutter's [[universal artificial intelligence]] builds upon this to calculate the [[expected value]] of an action.

===Mathematical===
The proof of the "razor" is based on the known mathematical properties of a probability distribution over a [[Countable set|countable]] set. These properties are relevant because the infinite set of all programs is a denumerable set. The sum S of the probabilities of all programs must be exactly equal to one (as per the definition of [[probability]]) thus the probabilities must roughly decrease as we enumerate the infinite set of all programs, otherwise S will be strictly greater than one.  To be more precise, for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; &gt; 0, there is some length ''l'' such that the probability of all programs longer than ''l'' is at most &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.  This does not, however, preclude very long programs from having very high probability.

Fundamental ingredients of the theory are the concepts of [[algorithmic probability]]  and [[Kolmogorov complexity]]. The universal [[prior probability]] of any prefix ''p'' of a computable sequence ''x'' is the sum of the probabilities of all programs (for a [[universal computer]]) that compute something starting with ''p''. Given some ''p'' and any computable but unknown probability distribution from which ''x'' is sampled, the universal prior and [[Bayes' theorem]] can be used to predict the yet unseen parts of ''x'' in optimal fashion.

==Modern applications==

===Artificial intelligence===
Though Solomonoff's inductive inference is not [[computable]], several [[AIXI]]-derived algorithms approximate it in order to make it run on a modern computer. The more computing power they are given, the closer their predictions are to the predictions of inductive inference (their mathematical [[limit (math)|limit]] is Solomonoff's inductive inference).&lt;ref&gt;J. Veness, K.S. Ng, M. Hutter, W. Uther, D. Silver. "A Monte Carlo AIXI Approximation" – [https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0801 Arxiv preprint], 2009 arxiv.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Veness, K.S. Ng, M. Hutter, D. Silver. "Reinforcement Learning via AIXI Approximation" [https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2049 Arxiv preprint], 2010 – aaai.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Pankov. A computational approximation to the AIXI model from agiri.org – Artificial general intelligence, 2008: proceedings of …, 2008 – books.google.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Another direction of inductive inference is based on [[E. Mark Gold]]'s model of [[Language identification in the limit|learning in the limit]] from 1967 and has developed since then more and more models of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gold | first1 = E. Mark | year = 1967 | title = Language identification in the limit | journal = Information and Control | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 447–474 | publisher =  | jstor =  | doi = 10.1016/S0019-9958(67)91165-5 | url=http://web.mit.edu/~6.863/www/spring2009/readings/gold67limit.pdf | format =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The general scenario is the following: Given a class ''S'' of computable functions, is there a learner (that is, recursive functional) which for any input of the form (''f''(0),''f''(1),...,''f''(''n'')) outputs a hypothesis (an index ''e'' with respect to a previously agreed on acceptable numbering of all computable functions; the indexed function may be required consistent with the given values of ''f''). A learner ''M'' learns a function ''f'' if almost all its hypotheses are the same index ''e'', which generates the function ''f''; ''M'' learns ''S'' if ''M'' learns every ''f'' in ''S''. Basic results are that all recursively enumerable classes of functions are learnable while the class REC of all computable functions is not learnable. 
{{citation needed|reason=The previously cited paper (Gold 1967) is only about learning of a language, i.e. (a description of) a set of strings, from a sequence of member strings. Another reference is needed for the more general scenario about learning functions from sample values, in particular about the basic results.|date=January 2014}}
Many related models have been considered and also the learning of classes of recursively enumerable sets from positive data is a topic studied from Gold's pioneering paper in 1967 onwards. A far reaching extension of the Gold’s approach is developed by Schmidhuber's theory of generalized Kolmogorov complexities,&lt;ref name=GenKolm&gt;{{cite journal| author=J. Schmidhuber | title=Hierarchies of generalized Kolmogorov complexities and nonenumerable universal measures computable in the limit | journal=International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science | volume=13 | issue=4 | pages=587–612 | year=2002 | url=ftp://ftp.idsia.ch/pub/juergen/ijfcspreprint.pdf| doi=10.1142/S0129054102001291}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are kinds of [[super-recursive algorithm]]s.

===Turing machines===

{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}

The third mathematically based direction of inductive inference makes use of the theory of automata and computation. In this context, the process of inductive inference is performed by an abstract automaton called an inductive [[Turing machine]] (Burgin, 2005).
''Inductive Turing machines'' represent the next step in the development of computer science providing better models for contemporary computers and computer networks (Burgin, 2001) and forming an important class of super-recursive algorithms as they satisfy all conditions in the definition of [[algorithm]]. Namely, each inductive Turing machines is a type of effective method in which a definite list of well-defined instructions for completing a task, when given an initial state, will proceed through a well-defined series of successive states, eventually terminating in an end-state. The difference between an inductive Turing machine and a [[Turing machine]] is that to produce the result a Turing machine has to stop, while in some cases an inductive Turing machine can do this without stopping. [[Stephen Kleene]] called procedures that could run forever without stopping by the name ''calculation procedure or algorithm'' (Kleene 1952:137). Kleene also demanded that such an algorithm must eventually exhibit "some object" (Kleene 1952:137). This condition is satisfied by inductive Turing machines, as their results are exhibited after a finite number of steps, but inductive Turing machines do not always tell at which step the result has been obtained.

Simple inductive Turing machines are equivalent to other models of computation. More advanced inductive Turing machines are much more powerful. It is proved (Burgin, 2005) that limiting partial recursive functions, trial and error predicates, general Turing machines, and simple inductive Turing machines are equivalent models of computation. However, simple inductive Turing machines and general Turing machines give direct constructions of computing automata, which are thoroughly grounded in physical machines. In contrast, trial and error predicates, limiting recursive functions and limiting partial recursive functions present syntactic systems of symbols with formal rules for their manipulation. Simple inductive Turing machines and general Turing machines are related to limiting partial recursive functions and trial and error predicates as Turing machines are related to partial recursive functions and lambda-calculus.

Note that only simple inductive Turing machines have the same structure (but different functioning semantics of the output mode) as Turing machines. Other types of inductive Turing machines have an essentially more advanced structure due to the structured memory and more powerful instructions. Their utilization for inference and learning allows achieving higher efficiency and better reflects learning of people (Burgin and Klinger, 2004).

Some researchers confuse computations of inductive Turing machines with non-stopping computations or with infinite time computations. First, some of computations of inductive Turing machines halt. As in the case of conventional Turing machines, some halting computations give the result, while others do not give. Second, some non-stopping computations of inductive Turing machines give results, while others do not give. Rules of inductive Turing machines determine when a computation (stopping or non-stopping) gives a result. Namely, an inductive Turing machine produces output from time to time and once this output stops changing, it is considered the result of the computation. It is necessary to know that descriptions of this rule in some papers are incorrect. For instance, Davis (2006: 128) formulates the rule when result is obtained without stopping as "… once the correct output has been produced any subsequent output will simply repeat this correct result." Third, in contrast to the widespread misconception, inductive Turing machines give results (when it happens) always after a finite number of steps (in finite time) in contrast to infinite and infinite-time computations.
There are two main distinctions between conventional Turing machines and simple inductive Turing machines. The first distinction is that even simple inductive Turing machines can do much more than conventional Turing machines. The second distinction is that a conventional Turing machine always informs (by halting or by coming to a final state) when the result is obtained, while a simple inductive Turing machine in some cases does inform about reaching the result, while in other cases (where the conventional Turing machine is helpless), it does not inform. People have an illusion that a computer always itself informs (by halting or by other means) when the result is obtained. In contrast to this, users themselves have to decide in many cases whether the computed result is what they need or it is necessary to continue computations. Indeed, everyday desktop computer applications like word processors and spreadsheets spend most of their time waiting in [[event loop]]s, and do not terminate until directed to do so by users.

====Evolutionary inductive Turing machines====
Evolutionary approach to inductive inference is accomplished by another class of automata called evolutionary inductive Turing machines (Burgin and Eberbach, 2009; 2012). An ‘’’evolutionary inductive Turing machine’’’ is a (possibly infinite) sequence ''E'' = {''A''[''t'']; ''t'' = 1, 2, 3, ... } of inductive Turing machines ''A''[''t''] each working on generations X[t] which are coded as words in the alphabet of the machines ''A''[''t'']. The goal is to build a “population” ''Z'' satisfying the inference condition. The automaton ''A''[''t''] called a component, or a level automaton, of E represents (encodes) a one-level evolutionary algorithm that works with input generations ''X''[''i''] of the population by applying the variation operators v and selection operator s. The first generation ''X''[0] is given as input to ''E'' and is processed by the automaton ''A''[1], which generates/produces the first generation ''X''[1] as its transfer output, which goes to the automaton ''A''[2]. For all ''t'' =&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;..., the automaton ''A''[''t''] receives the generation ''X''[''t''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1] as its input from ''A''[''t''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1] and then applies the variation operator v and selection operator ''s'', producing the generation ''X''[''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1] and sending it to ''A''[''t''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1] to continue evolution.

'''TomoPy''' is an open-sourced [[Python (programming language)|Python]] toolbox to perform tomographic data processing and image reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gürsoy D, De Carlo F, Xiao X, Jacobsen C | title=TomoPy: A framework for the analysis of synchrotron tomographic data | journal=Journal of Synchrotron Radiation | volume=21 | issue=5 | pages=1188–1193 | date=2014 | doi=10.1107/S1600577514013939| pmc=4181643 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Tomographic reconstruction]] creates three-dimensional views of an object by combining two-dimensional images taken from multiple directions, for example in how a [[X-ray computed tomography|computer-aided tomography]] scanner allows 3D views of the heart or brain. Data collection can be rapid, but the required computations are massive. Further, many common experimental perturbations can degrade the quality of tomographs, unless corrections are applied. Unless automated tools make these corrections, [[beamline]] staff can be overwhelmed by data that can be collected far faster than corrections and reconstruction can be performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Toby HB, Gürsoy D, De Carlo F, Schwarz N, Sharma H, Jacobsen C | title=Practices and standards for data and processing at the APS | journal=Synchrotron Radiation News | volume=28 | issue=2 | pages=15–21 | date=2015 | doi=10.1080/08940886.2015.1013415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To address the needs for image correction and tomographic reconstruction in an instrument independent manner, the TomoPy code was developed, which is a parallelizable high performance tomography library.

{{Discrimination sidebar}}
Both adults and children who have some form of [[disability]] will experience acts of [[violence]] against them more often than those without disabilities. Children with disabilities are 3.7 times more likely to be affected by any sort of violence, 3.6 times more likely to be victims of physical violence, 2.9 times more likely to be victims of [[sexual violence]], and children with [[intellectual impairment]] are among the most vulnerable being 4.6 times more likely to experience sexual violence than their non-disabled peers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/disabilities/violence/en/|title=Violence against adults and children with disabilities|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published by the [[World Health Organization]] titled ''Prevalence and risk of violence against adults with disabilities: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies'' revealed that adults with any form of disability are 1.5 times more likely to experience some form of violence while adults with some form of mental impairment are 4 times more likely to experience violence than those without disabilities. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/disabilities/publications/violence_children_lancet.pdf?ua=1|title=Prevalence and risk of violence against adults with disabilities: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison Groups ==
As mentioned by Powers and Oschwald,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Powers|first1=Laurie|last2=Oschwald|first2=Mary|date=|title=Violence and abuse against people with disabilities: Experiences, barriers and prevention strategies.|url=http://nasuad.org/sites/nasuad/files/hcbs/files/53/2622/AbuseandViolenceBrief.pdf|publisher=[[Oregon Health &amp; Science University]] Center on Self-Determination}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are seven categories of abusive behavior defined by both male and female individuals who have some form of disability: physical abuse, sexual abuse, verbal or emotional abuse, neglect or withholding support, financial abuse, manipulation of medications, and destroying or disabling equipment. With the scope of abuse being clearly defined, we can begin building evidence and empirical data from the individual experiences to find and implement solutions where they are most effective.

=== Institutional vs. non-institutional ===
When comparing and contrasting Institutional and Non-Institutional cases of violence against people with disabilities, we find that 82% of violence against people who are disabled happens when they are Institutionalized. Common thought is that Institutions "inherently promote abuse and dehumanization."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cdrnys.org/blog/advocacy/the-unacknowledged-crisis-of-violence-against-disabled-people/|title=The Unacknowledged Crisis of Violence Against Disabled People|last=Morgan|first=Cameron|publisher=Center for Disability Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, Institutionalized cases are far more present than Non-Institutionalized cases, statistics show that sexual assault based violence is 7 times more probable among intellectually disabled people and that number jumps to 12 times more probable if that person is a woman compared to a non-disabled peer.

=== Disability type vs. age ===
Age plays a major factor when looking into non-institutionalized violence. Those who have some form of disability ranging from the ages of 12 to 15 experience violence at a rate of 144.1 out of 1000 persons compared to their non-disabled peers at a rate of 38.8 out of a thousand with a rate difference being 105.3.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/capd0915st.pdf|title=Crime Against Persons with Disabilities, 2009-2015 - Statistical Tables|last=Harrel|first=Erika|date=July 2017|publisher=
[[Bureau of Justice Statistics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disabled teens ranging from the ages of 16 to 19 experience violence at a rate of 86.6 out of 1000 persons compared to their non-disabled peers at the rate of 31.4 out of 1000 persons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Examining the age ranges of 20 to 24, and 25 to 34 collectively to represent a persons twenties to mid thirties, the data shows that people with a some form of disability in that age range goes at a rate of 147.9 out of 1000 persons compared to 55.9 to their non-disabled peers with a rate difference of 92 out of 1000.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Disability type vs. gender ===
Examining statistics from ''Crime Against Persons with Disabilities''{{cn|date=December 2018}} table 5,{{clarify|the table must be here, you are not allowed to force readers to look elsewhere to make sense of this article|date=November 2018}} results highlight that females between the ages of 12 and higher experience slightly higher percentages of violence among the disabled community compared to males of the same age group except for ambulatory disabilities. The rate of violence committed against men with a cognitive disability is 55.4 while females are at 60.3 out of 1000.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ambulatory disability being the only category where men have a higher rate comes to 29.6 while females are at 29.3 with a difference of 0.3.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Visual impairment has a significant affect on the outcome of violence between the sexes as men are at a rate of 24.6 while females are 32.3 out of 1000 concluding a difference of 7.7.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lastly, table 8{{clarify|the table must be here, you are not allowed to force readers to look elsewhere to make sense of this article|date=November 2018}} displays a slight difference of 1.8 between the sexes with males at 15 while females are at 16.8.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Victim-offender relationship vs. disability status ===

Referencing ''Crime Against Persons with Disabilities''{{cn|date=December 2018}} table 8,{{clarify|the table must be here, you are not allowed to force readers to look elsewhere to make sense of this article|date=November 2018}} it is evident{{says who|date=November 2018}} that persons with disabilities are at risk of a higher rate of violence committed against them than their non-disabled peers. Additionally, according to the data, individuals who have some form of disability are at a higher risk of being victimized by a well-known or casual acquaintance over a complete stranger unlike their non-disabled peers; people whom have experienced an act of violence by a stranger with a disability being at 30.3% while non-disabled people are at 39.4% by a complete stranger.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''WINGS: Women IN Great Sciences''' WINGS is and open and inclusive network for all interested in equality at Lund University. The members of the network are scientists at all levels working in- or outside the university, including PhD students and postdocs, and other staff at Lund University. 

== Background ==

The network was initiated by co-workers at the Dept. of Geology, Lund University, in 2003 and was in the beginning an informal regular lunch club discussing science, careers and equality issues. During 2007 the network expanded to include the Faculty of Science and related indstries. In 2012 the network was further expanded to include the faculty of Medicine and the faculty of Engineering (LTH). In 2013 WINGS merged with StepUp, a PhD student and postdoc network focusing on career planning. In 2015, WINGS merged with the female grass root network WISE at CIRCLE, part of USV. We believe that by creating strong scientific networks, we can highlight our competence within the network and in interactions with others. WINGS has contacts with women in academia, research institutes, industry and funding agencies.

== Steering Group ==

The WINGS steering group is responsible for organizing activities (seminars, meetings, workshops and conferences) and distributing information to the members of the network (through this webpage, our emailing list and social media).   
The current steering committee consists of 8 members from all three faculties. The current coordinator is Johanna Stadmark, who is a researcher at Quaternary Sciences, Faculty of Science, after a common agreement of the rest of the members of the steering group.
WINGS are members of the [[European Platform of Women Scientists]], EPWS.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epws.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

WINGS organizes regular workshops and courses, as well as lunch-meetings with invited speakers to inspire discussion and development of research, career opportunities, [[innovation]] and the ongoing process of change for [[Gender equality|equality]]. Since 2008 WINGS organize a yearly conference to discuss research and equality issues. WINGS also organize a yearly networking congress for PhD students and postdocs called StepUp.
