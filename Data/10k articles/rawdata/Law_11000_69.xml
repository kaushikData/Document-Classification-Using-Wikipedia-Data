'''The Adelphi Charter on Creativity, Innovation and Intellectual Property''' is the result of a project commissioned by the [[Royal Society of Arts|Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce]], London, UK, and is intended as a positive statement of what good [[intellectual property]] [[policy]] is. The Charter was issued in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quinn|first1=Michael J.|title=Ethics for the Information Age|date=2011|publisher=Pearson|location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-13-213387-6|page=171|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charter has subsequently influenced thinking on Intellectual Property Law, and in particular, heavily influenced a subsequent copyright manifesto [[Copyright for Creativity]] - A Declaration for Europe.

==Adelphi Charter on Creativity, Innovation and Intellectual Property==
The Adelphi Charter reads:

Humanity’s capacity to generate new ideas and knowledge is its greatest asset. It is the source of art, science, innovation and economic development. Without it, individuals and societies stagnate.

This creative imagination requires access to the ideas, learning and culture of others, past and present. And, in the future, others will use what we have done.
Human rights call on us to ensure that everyone can create, access, use and share information and knowledge, enabling individuals, communities and societies to achieve their full potential.

Creativity and investment should be recognised and rewarded. The purpose of intellectual property law (such as copyright and patents) should be, now as it was in the past, to ensure both the sharing of knowledge and the rewarding of innovation.

The expansion in the law’s breadth, scope and term over the last 30 years has resulted in an intellectual property regime which is radically out of line with modern technological, economic and social trends. This disconnect threatens the chain of creativity and innovation on which we and future generations depend.

We therefore call upon governments and the international community to adopt these principles:

:1. Laws regulating intellectual property must serve as means of achieving creative, social and economic ends and must not be seen as ends in themselves.

:2. These laws and regulations must serve, and never overturn, the basic human rights to health, education, employment and cultural life.

:3. The public interest requires a balance between the public domain and private rights. It also requires a balance between the free competition which is essential for economic vitality and the monopoly rights granted by intellectual property laws.

:4. Intellectual property protection must not be extended to abstract ideas, facts or data.

:5. Patents must not be extended over mathematical models, scientific theories, computer code, methods for teaching, business processes, methods of medical diagnosis, therapy or surgery.

:6. Copyright and patents must be limited in time and their terms must not extend beyond what is proportionate and necessary.

:7. Government must facilitate a wide range of policies to stimulate access and innovation, including non-proprietary models such as open source software licensing and open access to scientific literature.

:8. Intellectual property laws must take account of developing countries’ social and economic circumstances.

:9. In making decisions about intellectual property law, governments should adhere to these rules:

::• There must be an automatic presumption against creating new areas of intellectual property protection, extending existing privileges or extending the duration of rights.

::• The burden of proof in such cases must lie on the advocates of change.

::• Change must be allowed only if a rigorous analysis clearly demonstrates that it will promote people’s basic rights and economic well-being.

::• Throughout, there should be wide public consultation and a comprehensive, objective and transparent assessment of public detriments and benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[File:AGPLv3 Logo.svg|thumb|Logo of the AGPLv3]]
The '''Affero General Public License''' ('''Affero GPL''' and informally '''Affero License''') is either of two distinct, though historically related, [[free software license]]s. The first is the Affero General Public License, version 1 (AGPLv1), as published by Affero, Inc. in March 2002, and based on the [[GNU General Public License]], version 2 (GPLv2).  The second is the Affero General Public License, version 2 (AGPLv2), published in November 2007, as a transitional license to allow an upgrade path from AGPLv1 to the [[GNU Affero General Public License]] (a variant of the original Affero GPL license that is compatible with GPLv3).

Both versions of the Affero GPL were designed to close a perceived [[application service provider]] (ASP) ''loophole'' in the ordinary GPL, where, by using but not distributing the software, the [[copyleft]] provisions are not triggered. Each version differs from the version of the GNU GPL on which it is based in having an added provision addressing use of software over a [[computer network]]. This provision requires that the full source code be made available to any network user of the AGPL-licensed work, typically a [[web application]].

==History==
In 2000, while developing an e-learning and e-service business model, [[Henry Poole (technologist)|Henry Poole]] met with [[Richard Stallman]] in Amsterdam where they discussed the ASP loophole in GPLv2. Over the following months, Stallman and Poole discussed approaches to solve the problem. In 2001, Poole founded Affero Inc. (a web services business), and he needed a license that would require distribution by other organizations who used Affero code to create derivative web services. At that time, Poole contacted [[Bradley M. Kuhn]] and [[Eben Moglen]] of the [[Free Software Foundation]] to get advice on a new license that would close the ASP loophole in GPLv2.

Around late February 2002, Kuhn suggested, based on the idea of a [[quine (computing)|quine]] (a program that prints its own source code), that GPLv2 be supplemented with a section 2(d) that would require derivative works to maintain a "download source" feature that would provide complete and corresponding source code.  Kuhn argued that there was precedent for such a requirement in GPLv2 section 2(c), which required preserving certain features by downstream distributors and modifiers.&lt;ref name="Stet_and_AGPLV3"&gt;{{cite web

  | deadurl     = yes

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moglen and Kuhn wrote the text of the proposed new section 2(d), and provided it to Poole, who then requested and received permission from the FSF to publish a derivative of GPLv2 for this purpose. In March 2002, Affero, Inc. published the original Affero General Public License (AGPLv1) for use with the Affero project and made the new license available for use by other [[software-as-a-service]] developers.

The FSF contemplated including the special provision of AGPLv1 into GPLv3 but ultimately decided to publish a separate license, nearly identical to GPLv3 but containing a provision similar in purpose and effect to section 2(d) of AGPLv1.  The new license was named the GNU Affero General Public License. Retaining the Affero name indicated its close historic relationship with AGPLv1.  The GNU AGPL was given version number 3 for parity with the GPL, and the current GNU Affero General Public License is often abbreviated ''AGPLv3''.

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; was published by the FSF on November 19, 2007.

== Compatibility with the GPL ==
Both versions of the AGPL, like the corresponding versions of the GNU GPL on which they are based, are [[Copyleft#Strong and weak copyleft|strong copyleft]] licenses. In the FSF's judgment, the added requirement in section 2(d) of Affero GPL v1 made it [[License compatibility|incompatible]] with the otherwise nearly identical GPLv2.  That is to say, one cannot distribute a single work formed by combining components covered by each license.

By contrast, GPLv3 and AGPLv3 each include clauses (in section 13 of each license) that together achieve a form of mutual compatibility for the two licenses. These clauses explicitly allow the "[[wikt:convey#Verb|conveying]]" of a work formed by linking code licensed under the one license against code licensed under the other license,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html The GNU General Public License – GNU Project – Free Software Foundation (FSF)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; despite the licenses otherwise not allowing relicensing under the terms of each other.&lt;ref name="fsf2"&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#AGPL List of free-software licences on the FSF website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000815065020/https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html |date=2000-08-15 }}: “''We recommend that developers consider using the GNU AGPL for any software which will commonly be run over a network''”.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the copyleft of each license is relaxed to allow distributing such combinations.&lt;ref name="fsf2" /&gt;

To establish an upgrade path from Affero's original AGPLv1 to the GNU AGPLv3, Affero, Inc. published the [http://www.affero.org/agpl2.html Affero General Public License version 2] in November 2007, which is merely a transitional license that allows recipients of  software licensed under "AGPLv1 or any later version as published by Affero, Inc." to distribute the software, or derivative works, under the GNU AGPLv3.

The Alternative Service Program is intended to encourage those called under Selective Service the option of working to improve national well-being as an alternative to bearing arms.  Typical period of service is meant to mirror the duration of conscription, usually 24 months.

'''Angolan nationality law''' is the body of law concerning who is a [[citizen]] of [[Angola]]. The basis of Angolan nationality law is ''Lei no.13/91 da nacionalidade, de 11 de maio'', ''Lei no.1/05 da nacionalidade, de 1 de julho'', and ''Decreto no.31/07 dos registos de nascimentos, de 14 de maio''.&lt;ref name=Manby /&gt;

==Acquisition of Angolan citizenship==
===By birth===
Birth in Angola alone is not sufficient grounds for a right to Angolan citizenship, unless the parents are unknown or [[statelessness|stateless]].&lt;ref name=Manby&gt;{{cite web|author=Manby, Bronwen|title="Citizenship Law in Africa: A Comparative Study"|publisher=Open Society Institute, 2010|accessdate=2013-07-02|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/women/docs/OtherEntities/OSJI%20CitizenshipAfricaStudy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===By descent===
Any child who has at least one Angolan citizen parent has a right to Angolan citizenship from birth, regardless of the place of birth or the marital status of the parents.&lt;ref name=Manby /&gt;

===By marriage===

The '''blank pad rule''' is a [[law|legal]] doctrine and [[metaphor]] in [[common law]] that requires a tribunal to base its decision solely upon evidence established at trial.&lt;ref name = Graham&gt;Kenneth Graham, ''Confrontation Stories: Raleigh on the Mayflower'', 3 {{smallcaps|Ohio St. J. Crim. L.}} 209, 210 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has established that in order for a trial to be fair and impartial, a "jury's verdict [must] be based on evidence received in open court, not from outside sources".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sheppard v. Maxwell]]'', {{ussc|volume=384|page=333|pin=349-50|year=1966}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The blank pad rule prohibits courts from considering evidence that has not been established at trial.&lt;ref name = Graham/&gt; The doctrine "supposes the minds of the jurors to be like empty tablets upon which the lawyers, under the supervision of the judge, inscribe everything they can legally use to decide the case".&lt;ref&gt;''In the Matter of American Eagle Airlines'', FAA Docket No. CP08SW0002 (Civil Penalty Action) (2008) (citing 21B {{smallcaps|Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. Evid.}} 2d § 5102.1).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[criminal law]], the doctrine has been interpreted as a right held by criminal defendants, where "an accused is entitled to a [[jury]] that goes into [[deliberation]]s with their minds void of everything except evidence that has been properly validated".&lt;ref name = Wright&gt;Wright and Graham, 21 {{smallcaps|Federal Practice and Procedure, Federal Evidence}}, § 5042 at 954&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[Due Process]] Clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] prohibits juries in civil cases from considering extrajudicial evidence during deliberations.&lt;ref name = Wright/&gt; The doctrine has also been applied to administrative decisions in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''In the Matter of American Eagle Airlines'', FAA Docket No. CP08SW0002 (Civil Penalty Action) (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; In general, it is [[Synonym|synonymous]] with the phrase ''[[tabula rasa]]'', a [[latin (language)|latin]] term that means "blank tablet" or "[[blank slate]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Tabula rasa'', {{smallcaps|Black's Law Dictionary}} 1465 (7th Ed. 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The origins of the blank pad rule have been traced as far back as the year 1164, when the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]] established that "[l]aymen are not to be accused save by proper and legal accusers and witnesses in the presence of the bishop".&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Graham, ''Confrontation Stories: Raleigh on the Mayflower'', 3 {{smallcaps|Ohio St. J. Crim. L.}} 209, 211 (2005); 30 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Kenneth W. Graham, Jr., {{smallcaps|Federal Practice &amp; Procedure Evidence}} § 6342, at 210–11 (2000) (citing Leonard W. Levy, {{smallcaps|Origins of the Fifth Amendment: The Right Against Self-Incrimination }}45 (1969)).&lt;/ref&gt; This principle was ultimately adopted by the common law tradition in England and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Graham, ''Confrontation Stories: Raleigh on the Mayflower'', 3 {{smallcaps|Ohio St. J. Crim. L.}} 209, 211–12 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; In Thomas Jefferson's 1776 draft of the [[Virginia]] Constitution, he provided that all cases "shall be tried by a jury upon evidence given viva voce, in open court".&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Graham, ''Confrontation Stories: Raleigh on the Mayflower'', 3 {{smallcaps|Ohio St. J. Crim. L.}} 209, 219 (2005) (citing Bernard Schwartz, The Bill of Rights: A Documentary History 243 (Bernard Schwartz ed., 1971)).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, United States Supreme Court [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Justice]] [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] remarked that "[a]ny judge who has sat with juries knows that in spite of forms they are extremely likely to be impregnated by the environing atmosphere".&lt;ref&gt;''Frank v. Mangum'', {{ussc|volume=237|page=309|pin=349|year=1915}} (Holmes, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application within Sixth Amendment jurisprudence==
The [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] provides a right to a trial "by an impartial jury".&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Const. amend. VI.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal scholars have observed that the Sixth Amendment incorporates "blank pad rule" protections that require tribunals to "make sure that criminal convictions rest only on evidence produced in open court".&lt;ref name = Graham/&gt; In ''Turner v. Louisiana'', the Supreme Court of the United States explained that the requirement that a verdict "must be based upon the evidence developed at the trial" is an essential component of the "fundamental integrity of all that is embraced in the constitutional concept of trial by jury".&lt;ref&gt;''Turner v. Louisiana'', {{ussc|volume=379|page=466|pin=472|year=1965}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it did not rely upon the Sixth Amendment in ''Marshall v. United States'', the Supreme Court of the United States ordered a new trial after the jury was exposed to "news accounts" that were not entered into evidence in court.&lt;ref&gt;''Marshall v. United States'', {{ussc|volume=360|page=310|pin=311-13|year=1959}} (per curiam).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}

A '''bonus clause''' is a clause in a contract that rewards the contractor for doing more than the letter of the contract; particularly, to finish the job early. It is in apposition to a [[Penal damages|penalty clause]] where the contractor loses by providing less than the letter of the contract, or providing it later than agreed.

The aim of a bonus clause is to give a [[win-win situation]] whereby the contractor wins by getting more money for finishing early, and the holder of the contract wins by having a product earlier to market.

'''Bosko "The Yugo" Radonjich''' ({{Lang-sr-Cyrl|Бошко Радоњић}}, {{Lang-sr-Latn|Boško Radonjić}}; 17 May 1943 &amp;ndash; 31 March 2011) was an American [[Serb]] nationalist and later leader of [[the Westies]], a predominantly [[Irish-American]] gang based in New York's [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]].

==Early life==
Radonjich was born in 1943 in [[Užice]]. Bosko's father, Dragomir, a teacher, was captured and executed during [[World War II]] by the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] for belonging to the [[Chetnik]]s led by general [[Draža Mihailović]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Stigmatized as a son of a royalist Chetnik soldier, Radonjich grew up in communist Yugoslavia under Tito.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In his late twenties, Radonjich fled the country and immigrated to the United States in 1970. Physically leaving Yugoslavia was no easy task for a person of his family background and he used a friendship with [[Red Star Belgrade]] footballer [[Milovan Đorić]] (also a son of a fallen Chetnik) to achieve this. Đorić sneaked Radonjich onto the team bus headed for [[Graz]], which allowed him to get across the border.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2000/01/20/srpski/R00011901.shtm Srbin šef irske mafije];''Glas javnosti'', 19 January 2000&lt;/ref&gt; After some time in [[Austria]], Radonjich went to [[Italy]] before immigrating to the United States.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Bosko Radonjich mentored [[venture capitalist]] [[Dusan Langura]] and financially backed him up for his first business ventures. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/09/nyregion/09radonjic.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==American years==
Once in America, Radonjich settled in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] area of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]]. He also joined the Serbian Homeland Liberation Movement (SOPO), an anti-communist and terrorist organization headed by [[Nikola Kavaja]]. Sharing royalist and anti-communist views, the two men became lifelong friends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/aktuelno.69.html:226365-Bio-opasniji-od-Karlosa Bio opasniji od Karlosa];''Večernje novosti'', 12 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Already known to Yugoslav state security [[UDBA]], Radonjich's activities began to be monitored even more closely by its agents. In 1975, Radonjich took part in a bombing at the Yugoslav mission to the [[United Nations]] in which no one was hurt. In 1978, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in the 1975 bombing of a Yugoslavian consul's home and for plotting to bomb a Yugoslav social club, both in [[Chicago]].&lt;!--how much time in jail was he sentenced to?--&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Upon his release in 1982, Radonjich moved back to [[New York City|New York]]'s West Side and began working as a minor associate of [[Jimmy Coonan]]. He seized control of the gang following the imprisonment of many of the Westies leadership during the late 1980s. Under his leadership, he was able to reestablish the Westies' former working relationship with the [[Gambino crime family]] under [[John Gotti]], and was involved in the jury tampering during Gotti's original 1986 trial for [[racketeering]]. One of the jurors, George Pape, didn't disclose that he was a friend of Radonjich during jury selection. After he was empanelled, he let it be known that he was willing to sell his vote to help acquit Gotti. Gambino capo and future underboss [[Sammy Gravano|Salvatore "Sammy the Bull" Gravano]] paid Pape $60,000 to guarantee at least a hung jury. Pape was convicted for his misconduct in 1992 and sentenced to three years in prison.&lt;ref name=casedropped/&gt;

Radonjich supervised Westie underling Brian Bentley's highly successful burglary ring using two Hispanic gang members until the arrest of Pavle Stanimirović and his group in the early 1990s. He was an associate of [[Vojislav Stanimirović (criminal)|Vojislav Stanimirović]] and his son, Pavle (aka Paul Montana, aka Punch), of the YACS organization. Later investigations under Michael G. Cherkasky, chief of the Investigations Division of the District Attorney's Office, would eventually force Radonjich to flee the United States for good in 1992 to avoid prosecution.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Back in Serbia==
Since 1990, Radonjich had already spent a sizeable amount of time in Serbia, mostly dividing his time between [[Belgrade]] where he owned a night club named Lotos in Zmaj Jovina Street and [[Zlatibor|Mount Zlatibor]] where he owned a casino named Palisade and where he also later built a casino named Club Boss located at [[Kraljeve Vode]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

As the [[Bosnian War]] broke out, Radonjich became a close adviser to [[Radovan Karadžić]], the [[Serbs of Montenegro|Montenegrin Serb]] leader charged with war crimes (on the run from 1996 until 2008), whom Radonjich described in a 1997 ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' article penned by Daniel Voll as: "My angel, my saint."{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Due to Zlatibor's close proximity to the Bosnian border, Radonjich also helped the Serbian war effort by providing funds for weapons and equipment as well as by arranging for soldiers to rehabilitate and rest. Throughout this time Radonjich maintained links with Serbian state security service (renamed from UDBA to SDB after the dissolution of SFR Yugoslavia) and its chief [[Jovica Stanišić]] with whom he shared a friendship. In autumn 1995, Radonjich was involved in the release operation of two French pilots who were shot down over Bosnia by the [[Army of Republika Srpska|Republika Srpska Army]] and held captive for more than a month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Hronika/245338/Lovac-na-Tita-koji-je-pomirio-irsku-i-italijansku-mafiju Lovac na Tita koji je pomirio irsku i italijansku mafiju];''Blic'', 2 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===1999 arrest in Miami===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2015}}
Though based in the Balkans, Radonjich frequently travelled abroad, especially to [[Caribbean]] and [[South America]]n destinations. During one such trip in late December 1999 after almost a decade spent in the former [[FR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], Radonjich was arrested by U.S. custom officials in [[Miami, Florida]]. Actually, he was on a plane from Europe to [[Cuba]] where he was going for New Year's celebrations, but after learning that Radonjich was on the passenger list, the [[FBI]] got the plane re-routed to Miami where he was arrested in spectacular manner as the entire airport was shut down.

He had been indicted in 1992 for giving a $60,000 bribe to a juror in the 1987 racketeering murder trial of [[John Gotti]], and thus was held without bail as a wanted fugitive. The charges against Radonjich were dropped after the key witness in his case, Gravano, was arrested for drug related offenses. Gravano had been the Gambinos' intermediary between Radonjich and the corrupt juror, Pape. However, the case against Radonjich was based almost entirely on Gravano's testimony, and Gravano's arrest made prosecutors believe his testimony would not be credible.&lt;ref name=casedropped&gt;{{cite news|last=Feuer|first=Alan|title=Jury-Fixing Case Dropped After Arrest of Gravano|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/03/nyregion/jury-fixing-case-dropped-after-arrest-of-gravano.html|accessdate=November 12, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 5, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radonjich was freed in March 2001. He immediately left the United States and went back to the former Yugoslavia. In subsequent interviews Radonjich claimed the FBI had ulterior motives for persecuting and harassing him: 

{{quote|In the late 1980s I found out through my sources that FBI along with the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] is preparing to arrest and put on trial the boss of bosses [[John Gotti]]. Unfortunately for me, only three people in America at that moment were allowed to have this piece of information - the [[United States Attorney|federal prosecutor]], the [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI director]], and the [[United States Attorney General|US Attorney General]]. In order to protect this [[classified information]], FBI decided to arrest me, so I had to leave America and seek refuge in Yugoslavia. Because of this they issued an arrest warrant for me based on which they organized my kidnapping on 31 December 1999 in Miami.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondo.rs/s201995/Info/Hronika_i_Drustvo/Umro_Bosko_Radonjic.html Umro Boško Radonjić], Mondo.rs, 1 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During spring 2003, following the [[Assassination of Zoran Đinđić|assassination]] of Serbian Prime Minister [[Zoran Đinđić]], Radonjich was arrested and questioned as part of [[Operation Sablja]], a wide-sweeping police action initiated by the Serbian authorities under the state of emergency. After spending three days in prison, Radonjich was released. He died following a brief illness in [[Belgrade, Serbia]] on 31 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bosko Radonjic, Gambino Family Ally, Dies at 67|author=Dennis Hevesi|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/09/nyregion/09radonjic.html|newspaper=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=9 April 2011|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*In the 1998 made-for-TV movie ''[[Witness to the Mob]]'', a very loose depiction of the life of Sammy the Bull, Radonjich is played by Stephen Payne.
*[[Niko Bellic]], the main character of ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', may have been inspired by Radonjich; both are Serbian criminals with ties to Italian and Irish organized crime.

The '''Burmese Way to Socialism''' ({{lang-my|မြန်မာ့နည်းမြန်မာ့ဟန် ဆိုရှယ်လစ်စနစ်}}; also known as the ''Burmese Road to Socialism'') refers to the [[ideology]] of the [[Socialist state|socialist government]] in [[Burma]], from 1962 to 1988, when the [[1962 Burmese coup d'état|1962 coup d'état]] was led by [[Ne Win]] and the [[Burmese military|military]] to remove [[U Nu]] from power. More specifically, the ''Burmese Way to Socialism'' is an economic treatise written in April 1962 by the [[Union Revolutionary Council|Revolutionary Council]], shortly after the coup, as a blueprint for [[economic development]], [[Isolationism|reducing foreign influence in Burma]] and [[Militarism|increasing the role of the military]].&lt;ref name="holmes"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holmes |first1=Robert A. |year=1967 |title=Burmese Domestic Policy: The Politics of Burmanization |journal=Asian Survey |publisher=University of California Press |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=188–197 |jstor=2642237 |doi=10.1525/as.1967.7.3.01p0257y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military coup led by Ne Win and the [[Union Revolutionary Council|Revolutionary Council]] (RC) in 1962 was done under the pretext of economic, religious and political crises in the country, particularly the issue of [[federalism]] and the right of [[States of Burma|Burmese states]] to secede from the [[Government of Burma|Union]].&lt;ref name="aungthwin"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aung-Thwin |first1=Maureen |last2=Thant |first2=Myint-U |year=1992 |title=The Burmese Ways to Socialism |journal=Third World Quarterly: Rethinking Socialism |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd. |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=67–75 |jstor=3992410 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burmese Way to Socialism has largely been described by scholars as being [[xenophobia|xenophobic]], [[superstition|superstitious]] and an "abject failure" and as turning one of the most prosperous countries in [[Asia]] into [[List of Poorest Countries|one of the world's poorest]].&lt;ref name="mcgowan"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McGowan |first1=William |year=1993 |title=Burmese Hell |journal=World Policy Journal |publisher=The MIT Press and the World Policy Institute |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=47–56 |jstor=40209305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it may have served to increase domestic stability and keep Burma from being as entangled in the [[Cold War]] struggles that affected other [[Southeast Asia]]n nations.&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt;

The Burmese Way to Socialism, by far, greatly increased [[poverty]] and [[isolationism|isolation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ql3habQL1QC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=%22Burmese+Way+to+Socialism#PPA59,M1|title=Economic Development of Myanmar|first=Myat|last=Thein|date=16 January 2018|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|accessdate=16 January 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stefancollignon.de/PDF/gspmain.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=13 August 2011|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813032542/http://www.stefancollignon.de/PDF/gspmain.pdf|archivedate=13 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been described as "disastrous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFA9etqLyrEC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=%22Burmese+Way+to+Socialism#PPA2,M1|title=Economic Development of Burma: A Vision and a Strategy|first1=Khan Mon Krann|last1=(U.)|first2=University of Singapore Center for Business Research &amp;|last2=Development|date=16 January 2018|publisher=NUS Press|accessdate=16 January 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ne Win's later attempt to make the [[Kyat|currency]] based in denominations divisible by 9, a number he considered auspicious, wiped out the savings of millions of [[People of Burma|Burmese]]. This resulted in the pro-[[democracy]] [[8888 Uprising]], which was violently halted by the military, which established the [[State Law and Order Restoration Council]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="newinbbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1581413.stm|title=Obituary: Ne Win|publisher=BBC | date=5 December 2002 | accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Under U Nu and the AFPFL-led coalition government, Burma had implemented socialist economic and welfare policies, which yielded slow economic growth throughout the 1950s.&lt;ref name="aungthwin"/&gt; On 28 October 1958, Ne Win had staged a coup, under the auspices of U Nu, who asked Ne Win to serve as interim prime minister, to restore order in the country, after the AFPFL split into two factions and U Nu barely survived a motion of no-confidence against his government in parliament. Ne Win restored order during the period known as the ''Ne Win [[caretaker government]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Nicholas Tarling | editorlink=Nicholas Tarling | year=1993 | title=The Cambridge History of Southeast Asia | isbn=0-521-35505-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elections were held in February 1960 and Ne Win handed back power to the victorious U Nu on 4 April 1960.

By 1958, Burma was largely beginning to recover economically, but was beginning to fall apart politically due to a split in the AFPFL into two factions, one led by Thakins Nu and Tin, the other by [[Ba Swe]] and Kyaw Nyein.&lt;ref name="ms"&gt;{{cite book|first=Martin|last= Smith|year=1991|title=Burma – Insurgency and the Politics of Ethnicity|publisher=Zed Books|location=London and New Jersey|pages=49, 91, 50, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58–9, 60, 61, 60, 66, 65, 68, 69, 77, 78, 64, 70, 103, 92, 120, 176, 168–9, 177, 178, 180, 186, 195–7, 193, 202, 204, 199, 200, 270, 269, 275–276, 292–3, 318–320, 25, 24, 1, 4–16, 365, 375–377, 414}}&lt;/ref&gt; And this despite the unexpected success of U Nu's 'Arms for Democracy' offer taken up by U Seinda in the Arakan, the [[Pa-O]], some Mon and Shan groups, but more significantly by the PVO surrendering their arms.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt; The situation became very unstable in the Union Parliament, with U Nu surviving a no-confidence vote only with the support of the opposition National United Front (NUF), believed to have 'crypto-communists' amongst them.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

Army hardliners now saw the 'threat' of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) coming to an agreement with U Nu through the NUF, and in the end U Nu 'invited' Army Chief of Staff General Ne Win to take over the country.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt; Over 400 'communist sympathisers' were arrested, of which 153 were deported to the Coco Island in the [[Andaman Sea]]. Among them was the NUF leader Aung Than, older brother of Aung San. Newspapers like ''Botahtaung'', ''Kyemon'' and ''Rangoon Daily'' were also closed down.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

Ne Win's caretaker government successfully established the situation and paved the way for [[Burmese general election, 1960|new general elections in 1960]] that returned U Nu's Union Party with a large majority.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt; The situation did not remain stable for long, when the [[Shan people|Shan]] [[federalism|Federal Movement]], started by [[Yaunghwe|Nyaung Shwe]] Saopha [[Sao Shwe Thaik]] (the first President of independent Burma 1948-52) and aspiring to a 'loose' [[federation]], was seen as a separatist movement insisting on the government honouring the right to secession in 10 years provided for by the [[Constitution of Burma|1947 Constitution]]. Ne Win had already succeeded in stripping the Shan [[Saopha]]s of their feudal powers in exchange for comfortable pensions for life in 1959.

==Ideological features==
The Burmese Way to Socialism has been described by some as [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]], [[neutralist]] and [[socialist]] in nature,&lt;ref name="badgley"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Badgley |first1=John H. |year=1963 |title=Burma: The Nexus of Socialism and Two Political Traditions |journal=A Survey of Asia in 1962: Part II |publisher=University of California Press |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=89–95 |jstor=3023680 |doi=10.1525/as.1963.3.2.01p16086}}&lt;/ref&gt; characterised also by an extensive dependence on the military, emphasis on the rural populace, and Burmese (or more specifically, Burman) nationalism.&lt;ref name="badgley"/&gt; In January 1963, the Burmese Way to Socialism was further elaborated in a political public policy called the System of Correlation of Man and His Environment ({{my|လူနှင့် ပတ်ဝန်းကျင်တို့၏ အညမည သဘောတရား}}), was published, as the philosophical and political basis for the Burmese approach to society and socialism, influenced by Buddhist, humanist and Marxist views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burmalibrary.org/docs/System-of-correlation.htm|title=THE SYSTEM OF CORRELATION OF MAN AND HIS ENVIRONMENT|website=Burmalibrary.org|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mental culture in Burmese crisis politics: Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy |last=Houtman |first=Gustaaf |year=1999 |publisher=ILCAA |location= |isbn=978-4-87297-748-6 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamentals of the Burmese Way to Socialism, as outlined in 1963, were as follows:
# In setting forth their programmes as well as in their execution the Revolutionary Council will study and appraise the concrete realities and also the natural conditions peculiar to Burma objectively. On the basis of the actual findings derived from such study and appraisal it will develop its own ways and means to progress.
# In its activities the Revolutionary Council will strive for self-improvement by way of self-criticism. Having learnt from contemporary history the evils of deviation towards right or left the Council will with vigilance avoid any such deviation.
# In whatever situations and difficulties the Revolutionary Council may find itself it will strive for advancement in accordance with the times, conditions, environment and the ever-changing circumstances, keeping at heart the basic interests of the nation.
# The Revolutionary Council will diligently seek all ways and means whereby it can formulate and carry out such programmes as are of real and practical value for the well-being of the nation. In doing so it will critically observe, study and avail itself of the opportunities provided by progressive ideas, theories and experiences at home, or abroad without discrimination between one country of origin and another.

The policy sought to reorient the Burmese economy to a socialist economy, to develop the Burmese military, and to construct a national identity among many disparate ethnic minorities and the majority Burmans.

==Impact==
Impacts of the Burmese Way to Socialism were multi-fold, affecting the economy, educational standards, and living standards of the Burmese people. Foreign aid organisations, like the American-based [[Ford Foundation]] and [[Asia Foundation]], as well as the [[World Bank]], were no longer allowed to operate in the country.&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt;  Only permitted was aid from a government-to-government basis. Also, English language instruction was reformed and introduced in secondary schools, whereas previously it had started in kindergarten. The government also implemented extensive visa restrictions for Burmese citizens, especially to Western countries. Instead, the government sponsored travel of students, scientists and technicians to the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Europe]] to receive training, to counter years of Western influence in the country.&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt; Similarly, visas for foreigners were limited to 24 hours.&lt;ref name="steinberg"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steinberg |first1=David I. |year=1997 |title=Myanmar: The Anomalies of Politics and Economics |journal=The Asia Foundation Working Paper Series |publisher=Asia Foundation |issue=5 |url=http://asiafoundation.org/pdf/wp5.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501111851/http://asiafoundation.org/pdf/wp5.pdf |archivedate=1 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, [[freedom of expression]] was limited extensively. Foreign language publications were prohibited, as were newspapers that printed "false propaganda news."&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt; The [[Press Scrutiny and Registration Division|Press Scrutiny Board]] (now the Press Scrutiny and Registration Division), which censors all publications to this day (including newspapers, journals, advertisements and cartoons), was established by the RC through the Printers' and Publishers' Registration Act in August 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.mizzimamedia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=37:media-in-burma&amp;Itemid=28] {{dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The RC set up the [[Myanmar News Agency|News Agency of Burma]] (BNA) to serve as a news distribution service in the country, thus effectively replacing the work of foreign news agencies. In September 1963, ''The Vanguard'' and ''The Guardian'', two Burmese newspapers, were nationalised. In December 1965, publication of privately owned newspapers was banned by the government.&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt;

The impact on the [[Burmese economy]] was extensive. The Enterprise Nationalization Law, passed by the [[Union Revolutionary Council|Revolutionary Council]] in 1963, nationalised all major industries, including import-export trade, rice, banking, mining, teak and rubber on 1 June 1963.&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt; In total, around 15,000 private firms were nationalised.&lt;ref name="aungthwin"/&gt; Furthermore, industrialists were prohibited from establishing new factories with private capital. This was particularly detrimental to the [[Anglo-Burmese]], [[Burmese Indians]] and the British, who were disproportionately represented in these industries. The oil industry, which had previously been controlled by American and British companies such as the General Exploration Company and East Asiatic Burma Oil, were forced to end operations. In its place was the government-owned Burma Oil Company, which monopolised oil extraction and production. In August 1963, the nationalisation of basic industries, including department stores, warehouses and wholesale shops, followed.&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt; Price control boards were also introduced.

The Enterprise Nationalization Law directly affected foreigners in Burma, particularly Burmese Indians and the [[Burmese Chinese]], both of whom had been influential in the economic sector as entrepreneurs and industrialists. By mid-1963, 2,500 foreigners a week were leaving Burma.&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt; By September 1964, approximately 100,000 Indian nationals had left the country.&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt;

The unofficial [[black market]] became a major feature in the economy, representing about 80% of national economy during the Socialist period.&lt;ref name="aungthwin"/&gt; Moreover, income disparity became a major socioeconomic issue.&lt;ref name="aungthwin"/&gt; Throughout the 1960s, Burma's foreign exchange reserves (to $50 million by 1971, from $214 million in 1964) steadily declined, while inflation grew.&lt;ref name="butwell"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Butwell |first1=Richard |year=1972 |title=Ne Win's Burma: At the End of the First Decade |journal=Asian Survey |publisher=University of California Press |volume=12 |issue=10 |pages=901–912 |url= |jstor=2643067 |doi=10.1525/as.1972.12.10.01p02694}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rice exports also declined, from 1,840,000 tons in 1961-62 to 350,000 tons in 1967-68, the result of both socialist policies and the inability of rice production to meet the population growth rates.

In the First [[Burma Socialist Programme Party|Burmese Socialist Programme Party]] (BSPP) Congress in 1971, economic reforms were made, in light of the failures of the economic policy pursued throughout the 1960s. The Burmese government asked to rejoin the World Bank, join the [[Asian Development Bank]] and sought more foreign aid and assistance.&lt;ref name="steinberg"/&gt; The [[Twenty-Year Plan]], an economic plan divided into five increments of implementation, was introduced, to develop the country's natural resources, including agriculture, forestry, oil and natural gas, through state development.&lt;ref name="steinberg"/&gt; These reforms brought living standards back to pre-World War II levels and stimulated economic growth.&lt;ref name="steinberg"/&gt; However, by 1988, foreign debt had ballooned to $4.9 billion, about three-fourths of the national GDP.&lt;ref name="steinberg"/&gt;

In United States law, '''competence''' concerns the mental capacity of an individual to participate in legal proceedings or transactions, and the mental condition a person must have to be responsible for his or her decisions or acts. Competence is an attribute that is decision specific.  Depending on various factors which typically revolve around mental function integrity, an individual may or may not be competent to make a particular medical decision, a particular contractual agreement, to execute an effective deed to real property, or to execute a will having certain terms.  Depending on the state, a guardian or conservator may be appointed by a court for a person who satisfies the state's tests for general incompetence, and the guardian or conservator exercises the incompetent's rights for the incompetent.  Defendants who do not possess sufficient "competence" are usually excluded from [[Crime|criminal]] [[prosecution]], while witnesses found not to possess requisite competence cannot testify. The [[English law|English]] equivalent is [[fitness to plead]].

==United States==

The word '''incompetent''' is used to describe persons who should not undergo certain judicial processes, and also for those who lack mental [[Capacity (law)|capacity]] to make [[contract]]s, handle their [[financial]] and other personal matters such as consenting to medical treatment, etc. and need a [[legal guardian]] to handle their affairs.

===Competence to stand trial===
In [[United States law]], the right to not be prosecuted while one is incompetent to stand trial has been ruled by the [[United States Supreme Court]] to be guaranteed under the [[due process clause]]. If the court determines that a defendant's mental condition makes him unable to understand the proceedings, or that he is unable to help in his defense, he is found incompetent. The  [[competency evaluation (law)|competency evaluation]], as determined in ''[[Dusky v. United States]]'', is whether the accused "has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding&amp;mdash;and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him." Being determined incompetent is substantially different from undertaking an [[insanity defense]]; competence regards the defendant's state of mind at the time of the trial, while insanity regards his state of mind at the time of the crime. In New York a hearing on competence to stand trial may be referred to as a "730 exam", after the law that governs the conduct of the exam, New York CPL Sec. 730.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People v Hasenflue, 48 AD3d 888 (2008)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6071490919236004604|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In  2006, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]] considered the legal standards for determining competence to stand trial and to waive counsel using the standards of objective unreasonableness under the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ruling of incompetence may later be reversed. A defendant may recover from a mental illness or disability, and a court may require a defendant to undergo treatment in an effort to render the defendant competent to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is Competence to Stand Trial|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/what-competence-stand-trial|website=ExpertLaw.com|publisher=ExpertLaw|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1989, [[Kenneth L. Curtis]] of [[Stratford, Connecticut]] was found mentally incompetent to stand trial following the murder of his estranged girlfriend. But years later, as he had attended college and received good grades, this ruling was reversed, and he was ordered to stand trial.

===Competence to be executed===
{{see also|Capital punishment in the United States}}
An inmate on [[death row]] has a right to be evaluated for competency by a [[psychologist]] to determine if sentence can be carried out.  This is a result of [[Ford v. Wainwright]], a case filed by a [[Florida]] inmate on [[death row]] who took his case to the [[United States Supreme Court]], declaring he was not competent to be [[Capital punishment|executed]]. The court ruled in his favor, stating that a forensic professional must make that competency evaluation and, if the inmate is found incompetent, must provide treatment to aid in his gaining competency so the execution can take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Competence to enter into a contract===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
Generally, in the United States, a person has the capacity or competence to make the decision to enter into a contract if the person has the ability to understand and appreciate, to the
extent relevant, all of the following:
(a) The rights, duties, and responsibilities created by, or affected by the decision.
(b) The probable consequences for the decisionmaker and, where appropriate, the persons affected by the decision.
(c) The significant risks, benefits, and reasonable alternatives involved in the decision. See, e.g., California Probate Code §812.&lt;ref name=DueProcessInCompetenceDetsAct&gt;{{cite web|title=California Probate Code Part 17.  Legal Mental Capacity|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=2.&amp;part=17.&amp;lawCode=PROB|publisher=California Legislature|accessdate=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competence and Native Americans===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}
Competency was used to determine whether individual [[Native Americans in the United States|Native  Americans]] could use land that was allotted to them from the General Allotment Act (GAA) also known as the [[Dawes Act]]. The practice was used after in 1906 with the passing of the Burk Act, also known as the forced patenting act. This Act further amended the GAA to give the Secretary of the Interior the power to issue allotees a patent in fee simple to people classified ‘competent and capable.’ The criteria for this determination is unclear but meant that allotees deemed ‘competent’ by the Secretary of the Interior would have their land taken out of trust status, subject to taxation, and could be sold by the allottee.

The Act of June 25, 1910 further amends the GAA to give the Secretary of the Interior the power to sell the land of deceased allotees or issue patent and fee to legal heirs. This decision is based on a determination made by the Secretary  of Interior whether the legal heirs are ‘competent’ or ‘incompetent’ to manage their own affairs.

===Competency case law===
[[Adjudicative competence]] has been developed through a body of [[common law]] in the United States. The landmark cases are the following:&lt;ref&gt;

{{Politics of Indonesia}}
The '''Constitutional Court of the Republic of Indonesia''' ({{lang-id|Mahkamah Konstitusi Republik Indonesia}}) is an court in [[Indonesia]] which part of Judicial branch of [[Government of Indonesia]], whose primary role is the reviewing of constitutionality under the Constitution. It also has administrative law functions such as ruling on competence disputes between governmental entities, giving final decisions on impeachments, and making judgments on the dissolution of political parties.

It was established as a consequence of the third amendment to the [[Constitution of Indonesia]], ratified by the [[People's Consultative Assembly]] on 9 November 2001. Between the adoption of the third Constitutional amendment and the establishment of the Constitutional Court, the duties of the Constitutional Court were carried out by the [[Indonesian Supreme Court|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="Denny241266"&gt;Denny Indrayana (2008), pp. 241, 266&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:ConstitutionalCourtIndonesia.jpg|right|180px|thumb|Aerial view of the Constitutional Court building]]

Between the adoption of the third Constitutional amendment and the establishment of the Constitutional Court, the duties of the Constitutional Court were carried out by the [[Indonesian Supreme Court|Supreme Court]].

In August 2003, the People's Consultative Assembly passed the Constitutional Court Act (Law No 24 of 2003) and the nine justices were appointed on 15 August. They were sworn in the following day. On 15 October 2003, the Supreme Court handed over authority, marking the start of the Constitutional Court's activities.&lt;ref name="MKWebsite"&gt;[http://www.mahkamahkonstitusi.go.id/index.php?page=web.ProfilMK&amp;id=1 Constitutional Court Website: History of The Constitution Court] accessed 17 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The nine founding judges were:

* Prof. Dr [[Jimly Asshiddiqie]] from the [[University of Indonesia]]
* Dr [[Harjono]] from [[Airlangga University]], [[Surabaya]]
* [[I Dewa Gede Palguna]] from Udayana University, [[Denpasar]]
* Dr [[Mohammad Laica Marzuki]], a former judge of the [[Supreme Court of Indonesia|Supreme Court]]
* Maruarar Siahaan, former chairman of the High Court of Bengkulu
* Soedarsono, former chairman of the Administrative High Court of Surabaya
* Prof. Mukthie Fajar from Brawijaya University, [[Malang]]
* Prof. H.A.S. [[Ahmad Natabaya]] from [[Sriwijaya University]], [[Palembang]]
* Lieutenant General (Retired) Roestandi.

For the first time, a prominent scholar who was actively involved in the process of discussing amendments to the Indonesian constitution and with the introduction of the idea of the constitutional court, Prof. Dr Jimly Asshiddiqie was elected the first chief judge (2003–2006). With the successful completion of his first period on the court, he was then re-elected as the chief judge for a second term of 2006-2009. He resigned from the court after finishing his first five-year term of office. After the completion of this first five years periode, the Constitutional Court has been considered one of the icon of Indonesian reform success story, together with the Anti Corruption Eradication Commission. The leadership of the court continued under [[Mohammad Mahfud|Prof. Dr Mohammad Mahfud]], a senior politician of National Awakening Party and member of parliament.

The constitutional court has five jurisdictions:

* Constitutional review of legislation (law)
* Disputes about constitutional competence between state institutions
* Disputes about electoral results
* Dissolution of [[List of political parties in Indonesia|political parties]]
* Impeachment of the [[President of Indonesia|President]] or [[Vice President of Indonesia]]

With the establishment of the court, the aim is to safeguard democracy and the constitution according to the principle of rule of law, and the constitutional rights of the people and human rights can be protected accordingly. The high-profile performance of the constitutional court has made it a respected institution in Indonesia. During the general election and the first presidential election in 2004, the role taken by the constitutional court was widely appreciated by the people. Many landmark decisions have been made in the fields of politics, social, and economic law since its first year of establishment. The rehabilitation of the political rights of former members of communist party, the prohibition of retroactive law of anti-terrorism, the abolition of articles of subversive law and of defamation against presidential institution, etc., are among the landmark decisions which made it influential in guiding the new democracy of Indonesia. Public interest in the court has included discussion of the appointment processes of judges; the delineation of responsibilities between the Constitutional Court and other parts of the legal system; and overall approach that the Court has taken to the issues that it has considered.&lt;ref&gt;Prodita Sabarini and Ina Parlina, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/05/03/constitutional-court-independence-last-resort.html Constitutional Court: Independence of the last resort'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 3 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2011 the [[People's Representative Council|Indonesian parliament]] approved certain changes to the 2003 Constitutional Court Law that established the Constitutional Court.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://jakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/archive/constitutional-courts-power-to-be-limited/ Constitutional Court's power to be limited]', ''The Jakarta Globe'', 15 June 2011. Dicky Christanto, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/06/22/house-passes-amendments-constitutional-court-law.html House passes amendments to Constitutional Court law]', ''The Jakarta Post'', 22 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The revisions approved include changes to the arrangements for the Court's ethics council, a strengthening of the qualifications and experience required for the appointment of justices, a reduction in the term of the Court's chair and deputy chair (to two-and-a-half years, down from three years), and raising the mandatory retirement age for justices from 67 years to 70 years.  The proposal to change the arrangements for the membership of the Court's ethics council was a controversial issue with the first chief judge of the court, Jimly Asshiddiqie, describing the planned changes as "frivolous."

In October 2013, in a move designed to improve the standards of appointment of justices to the Court following the arrest of the then-chief justice [[Akil Mochtar]], president [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] issued a regulation-in-lieu-of-law (known as a ''Peraturan Pemerintah Pengganti Undang-undang'' or ''Perppu'').  The ''Perppu'' set out new arrangements relating to the processes of selection of justices.  Under the proposed arrangements, a Constitutional Court justice is not to have had links to a political party for at least seven years and would have to undergo screening by an independent selection panel.  In addition, a permanent ethics committee was be established to monitor the performance of the Court.  On 19 December 2013 the Indonesian parliament endorsed the ''Perppu''.&lt;ref&gt;Haeril Halim and Ina Parlina, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/12/20/houses-endorses-sby-s-mk-reform-plan.html House endorses SBY's MK reform plan'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 20 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers==
The court has the same legal standing as the Supreme Court. Its powers, set out in article 24C of the [[Constitution of Indonesia|Constitution]], include the final say in reviewing laws concerning the Constitution, disputes over the authority of state institutions, the dissolution of political parties and disputes over election results. It also is obliged to rule on any attempt to impeach the president.

Its jurisdiction on the electoral disputes &lt;ref&gt;Jimly Asshiddiqie, The Constitutional Law of Indonesia: A Comprehensive Overview, Thompson Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; was first limited to the five-yearly general elections (such as the 2004 and 2009 general elections). However, since 2009 the definition of general election has been broadened and includes the election of [[Provinces of Indonesia|governors]] and [[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|regency]] heads (''bupati''). To date, of the five jurisdictions of the court, most cases handled have centred around issues of judicial review, disputed electoral results, and disputes between state institutions. The Supreme Court continues to perform an informal judicial review function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palmer|first=Wayne|last2=Missbach|first2=Antje|date=2018|title=Judicial Discretion and the Minimum Statutory Sentence for Migrant Smuggling through Indonesia|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/asian-journal-of-law-and-society/article/judicial-discretion-and-the-minimum-statutory-sentence-for-migrant-smuggling-through-indonesia/44343C9547CE2DFAAF3B7CC6431B6B9A|journal=Asian Journal of Law and Society|language=en|pages=1–19|doi=10.1017/als.2018.7|issn=2052-9015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major problem for the court, like other parts of the legal system in Indonesia, is enforcement of decisions.  The ability of the court system in Indonesia to have decisions enforced is sometimes quite weak and in recent years across Indonesia local officials have, in some cases, refused to abide by important decisions of the Constitutional Court.&lt;ref&gt;See International Crisis Group, [http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/asia/south-east-asia/indonesia/b138-indonesia-defying-the-state Indonesia: Defying the State] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902043714/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/asia/south-east-asia/indonesia/b138-indonesia-defying-the-state |date=2 September 2012 }}, Update Briefing, Asia Briefing No 138, 30 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
===Chief Justice===
{{main|Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court of Indonesia}}
The chief justice of the court is elected by the members of the court from amongst their number.

===Deputy Chief Justice===
[[Deputy Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court of Indonesia]] is second highest-ranking official serving on the Constitutional Court of Indonesia. Like the Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court of Indonesia, the Deputy Chief Justice is elected by the nine serving justices on the court from among their number.

===Justices===
The Indonesian Constitution specifies that the Court must have nine justices. The Indonesian Parliament (the [[People's Representative Council|DPR]] or House of Representatives), the president and the Supreme Court are each entitled to appoint three justices to serve five-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;Ina Parlina and Margareth S Aritonang, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/02/28/house-begins-selection-new-constitutional-court-justice.html House begins selection of new Constitutional Court justice'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 28 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ina Parlina, [http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/01/07/jokowi-appoints-pdi-p-cadre-new-justice.html Jokowi appoints PDI-P cadre as new justice].

The process of appointment of justices to the court is subject to some controversy.  For example, in mid-August 2013 president Susilo Bambang Yodhoyono appointed a new justice, Patrialis Akbar, to replace retiring justice Achmad Sodiki, and reappointed former justice Maria Indrati. The appointment was challenged by a group of legal activists in a challenge that was upheld by the Jakarta State Administrative Court in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Ina Parlina, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/12/24/administrative-court-strips-patrialis-mk-seat.html-0 Administrative court strips Patralis of MK seat'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 24 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal by Yudhoyono's office on behalf of Akbar and Indrati was ultimately successful.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Butt, [https://books.google.com.sa/books?id=gWhECQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=patrialis+akbar+appeal+court&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9AVdDArodz&amp;sig=b4-8JZUhHxO1HzcTSKS2NFCXgTQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=patrialis%20akbar%20appeal%20court&amp;f=false The Constitutional Court and Democracy in Indonesia], pg. 41.

In [[copyright law]],&lt;!-- [[intellectual property]] law //It is not a general IP issue; it is mainly a copyright issue --&gt; the legal status of '''[[hyperlinking]]''' (also termed "'''linking'''") and that of '''[[Framing (World Wide Web)|framing]]''' concern how courts address two different but related web technologies. In large part, the legal issues concern use of these technologies to create or facilitate public access to proprietary media content &amp;mdash; such as portions of commercial Web sites.
When hyperlinking and framing have the effect of distributing, and creating routes for the distribution of content (information) that does not come from the proprietors of the Web pages affected by these practices, the proprietors often seek the aid of courts to suppress the conduct, particularly when the effect of the conduct is to disrupt or circumvent the proprietors' mechanisms for receiving [[Royalties|financial compensation]].

The issues about linking and framing have become so intertwined under copyright law that it is impractical to attempt to address them separately. As will appear, some decisions confuse them with one another, while other decisions involve and therefore address both. Framing involves the use of hyperlinking, so that any challenge of framing under copyright law is likely to involve a challenge of hyperlinking as well. (The converse is not true.)

==Linking==
While hyperlinking occurs in other technologies, US copyright litigation has centered on HTML. Accordingly, this article considers only such technology.

===Ordinary link===
The HTML code for a simple, ordinary hyperlink is as shown below.

A home-page link would be written this way:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="html5"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.uspto.gov/"&gt;USPTO&lt;/a&gt;

===Deep link===
Most Web sites are organized hierarchically, with a home page at the top and deeper pages within the site, reached by links on the home page. [[Deep linking]] is the practice of using a hyperlink that takes a user directly to a page other than the top or home page. The link given below is a deep link. 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="html5"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/index.html"&gt;General Information Concerning Patents&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A typical Internet browser will render the foregoing HTML code as:

{{block indent|1=&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline; color:#36b;"&gt;General Information Concerning Patents&lt;/span&gt;}}

When a user clicks on the underlined text, the browser jumps from the page on which the link is shown to a page of the website of the [[US Patent and Trademark Office]] that has the [[URL]] (web address) shown above; http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/index.html.

Several lawsuits have involved complaints by proprietors of Web pages against the use of deep links.

===Inline link===
Related issues arise from use of [[Inline linking|inline links]] (also image-source or img-src links, so called because the HTML code begins with "img src=") on Web pages. An inline link places material — usually an image such as a Jpeg or Gif — from a distant Web site onto the Web page being viewed. For example, the adjacent image is the seal of the U.S. Patent Office, as shown on some of its pages at the PTO Web site. The URL of one version of the PTO seal image is http://www.uspto.gov/images/uspto_seal_200.gif, a version of which can be seen in context at http://www.uspto.gov/main/profiles/copyright.htm. The former of these becomes an inline or img-src link if ''img src='' is inserted before the ''http'', angle brackets enclose the whole expression, and the entire code fragment is inserted into the text of a page of HTML code.

When an inline (img-src) link of an image is used on a Web page, it seems to be present as a part of the Web page. The presence of the image is only virtual, however, in the sense that the image file is not physically present at the server for the Web site being viewed. The actual location of the image file, if the image were that of the PTO seal, would be at the PTO server in Virginia. Use of inline linking has led to contentious litigation (discussed below).

===Hierarchy of links===

[[File:US Supreme Court front view.png|135px|thumb|right|Front view of the US Supreme Court, uploaded to Wikipedia server]]

The image at right is a front view of the US Supreme Court (SCOTUS). It can be found on the SCOTUS website as an element in the headings for various pages of that site, for example, these: https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx - Biographies of Current Justices of the Supreme Court; https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/about.aspx - About the Supreme Court; and https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/courtbuilding.aspx - The Supreme Court Building. The image can also be found in isolation: https://www.supremecourt.gov/images/sectionbanner13.png - All of these files are stored on the SCOTUS server, and they can be accessed by clicking on the respective hyperlinks. Those links are all deep links. The link to the SCOTUS main page or portal is https://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx .

Image links can be categorized in a hierarchical series, based on the technological expedient used to effectuate the link, as explained below. The same series corresponds to successively lower levels of risk of copyright infringement liability. The hierarchy operates as follows, using the picture of the SCOTUS building as an example for discussion purposes (selected because it is in the public domain and is not subject to copyright protection; 17 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;105 provides that copyright protection is not available for any work of the United States Government). An image may be placed on a webpage or made available for viewing by any of the following expedients:
*Copying the image file to the server hosting the page (as that of the Supreme Court has been copied to the Wikipedia server to present the image at the upper right of this section of text).  Unless the image is in the public domain, that copying will create copyright infringement liability unless a defense, such as [[fair use]] or license, applies.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Perfect 10, Inc. v. Google, Inc.'', 508 F.3d 1146 (9th Cir. 2007), the Ninth Circuit held that when Google stored thumbnail versions of Perfect 10's magazine images on its server to communicate them to Google's users, Google prima facie violated Perfect 10's copyright. But the court also held that Google had a valid fair use defense. ''Id''. at 1163-64.&lt;/ref&gt; The HTML code for embedding such an image in text is the ordinary form for an image in text (where the png file is in same directory as the text): &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;img src="Supreme_Court.png" align=right&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*Using an img-src link to the image at the proprietor's webpage, to make the page ''appear'' to contain the image. [[File:US Supreme Court front view.png|135px|thumb|right|Front view of the US Supreme Court, deep linked to a distant server]]  In an ordinary context, the page's creator would place text around the image, making the image appear as it does at the immediate right. The image from an img-src link looks like the image from a file copied to the page's server, even though the image (i.e., its code) is actually stored on the remote server of the other website and not on the page's own server. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit considered this fact of crucial significance in the ''Perfect 10'' case, discussed subsequently in this article. The court held that, when Google provided links to images, Google did not violate the provisions of the copyright law prohibiting unauthorized reproduction and distribution of copies of a work: "Because Google's computers do not store the photographic images, Google does not have a copy of the images for purposes of the Copyright Act."&lt;ref&gt;508 F.3d at 1160.&lt;/ref&gt; (This fact about image storage is also true of all links that follow in this list.)

:This expedient has been challenged as copyright infringement. See the ''Arriba Soft'' and ''Perfect 10'' cases (below). In the ''Perfect 10'' case, Perfect 10 argued that Google's Image pages caused viewers to believe they were seeing the images on Google's website. The court brushed this argument aside: "While in-line linking and framing may cause some computer users to believe they are viewing a single Google webpage, the Copyright Act, unlike the Trademark Act, does not protect a copyright holder against acts that cause consumer confusion."&lt;ref&gt;508 F.3d at 1161.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Using an ordinary (deep) hyperlink to the image at the remote server, so that users must click on a link on the hosting page to jump to the image. The HTML code would be &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/images/sectionbanner13.png&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This has been protested because it bypasses everything at the other site but the image. Such protests have been largely ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly unsuccessfully argued this point in ''Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp.'', 336 F.3d 811, 816 (9th Cir. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; This argument on Kelly's behalf is articulated in the ''amicus curiae'' brief supporting Kelly by the American Society of Media Photographers:&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]t was the actual display of the full-size images of Kelly’s work stripped from the original context that was not fair use. Merely linking to Kelly's originating home page, on the other hand, without free-standing display of the full-size images, would not run afoul of the fair use limits established by the Panel. It is striking that nowhere in [the adversaries'] briefs do they explain why linking could not be constructed in this fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/ch6b2.htm |title=Chapter 6B2 - I.P. Protection of Digital Rights in the New Millennium |website=Docs.law.gwu.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*Using a deep link to the specific page on the image proprietor's website at which the image is located, thus presenting the image to the user along with the textual material with which the proprietor surrounded it (but avoiding the portal or home page). The HTML code is &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx&lt;/nowiki&gt; for ''Biographies of Current Justices of the Supreme Court''. This has been protested because it does not require the viewer to look at the advertising or other material at the home and other earlier pages on the proprietor's site, although the user must look at what is on the same page as the image. Such protests have been largely ineffective.
*Linking to the home page of the image proprietor's Web site and explaining how to page down through his successive pages and all of his extraneous material to find the image. For example: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This will not create copyright infringement liability under any theory thus far advanced in US litigation.&lt;ref&gt;A more detailed description of the alternatives with implementing HTML code snippets is available at ''Is Linking Copyright Infringement?''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Framing===
Framing  is the juxtaposition of two separate web pages within the same page, usually with a separate frame with navigational elements.
[[Framing (World Wide Web)|Framing]] is a method of presentation in a Web page that breaks the screen up into multiple non-overlapping windows. Each window contains a display from a separate HTML file, for example, a Web page from a different Web site that is fetched by [[AutoLink|automatically hyperlinking to it]]. While the usage of frames as a common web design element has been deprecated for several years (replaced by the usage of [[Span and div|&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;]] elements), some sites, like [[Google Images]] and [[Google Translate]], use frames as a way to help navigate non-Google pages from a framed Google interface.

Incorporating copyrighted web content by usage of framing has led to contentious litigation. Frames can be used for web pages belonging to the original site, or to load pages from other sites into a customized arrangement of frames that provide a generalized interface without actually requiring the viewer to browse the linked site from that site's URLs and interfaces.

Proprietors of copyright in framed pages have at times contended that framing their Web pages constituted copyright infringement of their copyrights. The problem with basing the theory of copyright infringement on a reproduction ({{usc|17|106}}(1)) or distribution ({{usc|17|106}}(3)) of copies by the accused infringer is that the latter does not directly ''reproduce'' or ''distribute'' any copy of the original Web page. Rather, the accused infringer simply establishes a pointer that the user's browser follows to the proprietor's server and Web page.

For a pedagogically exaggerated example of the kind of framing that has incensed proprietors of copyright in web pages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/Ad'frame.htm |title=Framing the 'Framing' Page |website=Docs.law.gwu.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; which "frames" a page titled Is Framing Copyright Infringement?. On the theory that a picture is worth 1000 words, the viewer is invited to compare the referenced pages to understand what framing is and why it annoys proprietors of framed pages.

==History of copyright litigation in field==
In large part, linking and framing are not held to be [[copyright infringement]] under US and German copyright law, even though the underlying Web pages are protected under copyright law. Because the copyright-protected content is stored on a server other than that of the linking or framing person (it is stored on the plaintiff's server), there is typically no infringing "copy" made by the defendant linking or framing person (as may be essential), on which to base liability. Some European countries take a more protective view, however, and hold unauthorized framing and so-called deep linking unlawful.

===European Union===

The [[European Court of Justice]]'s binding ruling in 2014 was that embedding a work could not be a violation of copyright:
{{quote|The embedding in a website of a protected work which is publicly accessible on another website by means of a link using the framing technology … does not by itself constitute communication to the public within the meaning of [the EU Copyright directive] to the extent that the relevant work is neither communicated to a new public nor by using a specific technical means different from that used for the original communication|[https://edri.org/cjeu-embedding-copyright-infringement/ EDRI translation] of original [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=159023&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=FR&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=382141 Courth ruling (C-348/13) of the BestWater International GmbH vs. Michael Mebes and Stefan Potsch] (ECLI:EU:C:2014:2315)}}

In September 2016, the European Court of Justice ruled that knowingly linking to an unauthorized posting of a copyrighted work for commercial gain constituted infringement of the exclusive right to communicate the work to the public. The case surrounded [[GeenStijl]] and [[Sanoma]];  in 2011, photos were leaked from an upcoming issue of the Dutch version of ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' (published by Sanoma), and hosted on a website known as FileFactory. GeenStijl covered the leak by displaying a thumbnail of one of the images, and linking to the remainder of the unauthorized copies. The court ruled in favor of Sanoma, arguing that GeenStijl's authors knowingly reproduced and communicated a copyrighted work to the public without consent of its author, and that GeenStijl had profited from the unauthorized publication.&lt;ref name="verge-eulinkingcopyright"&gt;{{cite web|title=Europe’s Court of Justice rules that hyperlinking can infringe on copyright|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/11/12877872/eu-court-of-justice-hyperlinking-infringe-copyright.theverge.com/2016/9/11/12877872/eu-court-of-justice-hyperlinking-infringe-copyright|website=The Verge|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===

====''Belgian Association of Newspaper Editors v. Google''====
In September 2006 the Belgian Association of Newspaper Editors sued Google and obtained an injunctive order from the Belgian Court of First Instance that Google must stop deep linking to Belgian newspapers without paying royalties, or else pay a fine of [[€]]1 million daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finfacts.com/irelandbusinessnews/publish/article_10007329.shtml |title=Irish business, finance news on economics |website=Finfacts.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many a newspaper columns were critical of the Belgian newspapers' position.&lt;ref name="A Reality Check for Newspapers - A Reality Check for Newspapers"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/public/article/SB117821484698091141.html|title=A Reality Check for Newspapers|publisher= Wall Street Journal|accessdate=May 7, 2007 | first=Jason | last=Fry | date=May 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But when we really look at the court ruling there is no conviction for using hyperlinks. Google was convicted for copyright issues in Google cache and using reproductions on Google News. The court ruled that Google News was a portal and not a search engine and that it not used snippets but reproductions on that portal. The Court also ruled using hyperlinks was not a problem, a Belgium blogger (deinternetmarketeer.be) cleared this out when getting annoyed with the fact that half of the world published false facts without checking them in the Court rule.

===Denmark===

====''Danish Newspaper Publishers Association v. Newsbooster''====
The Bailiff's Court of Copenhagen ruled in July 2002 against the Danish website Newsbooster, holding, in a suit brought by the Danish Newspaper Publishers Association (DNPA), that Newsbooster had violated Danish copyright law by deep linking to newspaper articles on Danish newspapers' Internet sites.  Newsbooster's service allows users to enter keywords to search for news stories, and then deep links to the stories are provided. The DNPA said that this conduct was "tantamount to theft." The court ruled in favor of the DNPA, not because of the mere act of linking but because Newsbooster used the links to gain commercial advantage over the DNPA, which was unlawful under the [[Danish Marketing Act]]. The court enjoined Newsbooster's service.&lt;ref name="wired-deeplink"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2002/07/53697?currentPage=all|title=Deep Link Foes Get Another Win|publisher=Wired|author=Michelle Delio|date=8 July 2002|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''home A/S v. Ofir A-S''====
The Maritime and Commercial Court in Copenhagen took a somewhat different view in 2005 in a suit that home A/S, a real estate chain, brought against Ofir A-S, an Internet portal (OFiR), which maintains an Internet search engine. home A/S maintains an Internet website that has a searchable database of home's current realty listings. Ofir copied some database information, which the court held unprotected under Danish law, and also Ofir's search engine provided deep links to the advertisements for individual properties that home A/S listed, thus by-passing the home page and search engine of home A/S. The court held that the deep linking did not create infringement liability. The Court found that search engines are desirable, as well as necessary to the function of the Internet; that it is usual that search engines provide deep links; and that businesses that offer their services on the Internet must expect that deep links will be provided to their websites. Ofir's site did not use banner advertising and its search engine allowed users, if they so chose, to go to a home page rather than directly to the advertisement of an individual property. The opinion does not appear to distinguish or explain away the difference in result from that of the ''Newsbooster'' case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In November 2008, the DNPA, citing its success against Newsbooster, demanded that Google stop deep linking to stories in Danish newspapers without paying royalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=17:50&amp;nbsp;GMT |url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/11/22/denmark-deep-linking-under-fire-by-newspaper-publishers/ |title=Denmark: "Deep Linking" Under Fire by Newspaper Publishers · Global Voices |website=Globalvoicesonline.org |date=2008-11-22 |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===

====''Holtzbrinck v. Paperboy''====
In July 2003 a German Federal Superior Court held that the Paperboy search engine could lawfully deep link to news stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/german-court-deep-linking-is-legal |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 27, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119080550/http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/german-court-deep-linking-is-legal |archivedate=November 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An appellate court then overturned the ruling, but the German Federal Supreme Court reversed in favor of Paperboy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.managingip.com/Article/1326313/German-ruling-sanctions-deep-linking.html |title=German ruling sanctions deep linking &amp;#124; Managing Intellectual Property |website=Managingip.com |date=2003-07-27 |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A sensible use of the immense wealth of information offered by the world wide web is practically impossible without drawing on the search engines and their hyperlink services (especially deep links)," the German court said.

====''Decision I-20 U 42/11 Dusseldorf Court of Appeal 8 October 2011''====
In Germany making content available to the public on a website by embedding the content with inline links now appears to be copyright infringement.  This applies even though a copy has never been taken and kept of an image and even though the image is never "physically" part of the website.  The Düsseldorf appeal court overruled the lower Court of First Instance in this case.  The Defendant had included links on his blog to two photographs which appeared on the Claimant’s website.  No prior permission had been sought or obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Posted by cliffordmiller |url=http://cliffordmillerlaw.wordpress.com/2012/01/27/embedding-images-from-third-party-sites-in-websites-is-copyright-infringement/ |title="Embedding" Images From Third Party Sites In Websites Is Copyright Infringement &amp;#124; cliffordmillerlaw |website=Cliffordmillerlaw.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===

====''Shetland Times Ltd. v. Wills''====
The first suit of prominence in the field was ''Shetland Times Ltd. v. Wills'', Scot. Ct. of Session (Edinburgh, 24 Oct 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netlitigation.com/netlitigation/cases/shetland.htm |title=Cases &amp;#124; Shetland Times v. Jonathan Wills |website=Netlitigation.com |date=1996-10-24 |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shetland Times challenged use by Wills of deep linking to pages of the newspaper on which selected articles of interest appeared. The objection was that defendant Wills thus by-passed the front and intervening pages on which advertising and other material appeared in which the plaintiff had an interest but defendant did not. The Times obtained an interim interdict (Scottish for preliminary injunction)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linksandlaw.com/decisions-87.htm |title=Shetland News v.

===United States of America===

====''Washington Post v. Total News''====
In February 1997 the Washington Post, CNN, the Los Angeles Times, Dow Jones (''Wall Street Journal''), and Reuters sued Total News Inc. for framing their news stories on the Total News Webpage. The complaint was filed in New York federal district court. The case was settled in June 1997, on the basis that linking without framing would be used in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/cyberlaw/totalnew.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013025653/http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/cyberlaw/totalnew.html |archivedate=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Ticketmaster v. Microsoft''====
In April 1997 Ticketmaster Corp. sued Microsoft Corp. in Los Angeles federal district court for deep linking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/Tickm'v'Msft.htm |title=Ticketmaster Complaint v. Microsoft |website=Docs.law.gwu.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ticketmaster objected to Microsoft's bypassing the home and intermediate pages on Ticketmaster's site, claiming that Microsoft had "pilfered" its content and diluted its value. Microsoft's ''Answer''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/MsftAnsTick.htm |title=Microsoft's Answer to Ticketmaster |website=Docs.law.gwu.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; raised a number of defenses explained in detail in its pleadings, including implied license, contributory negligence, and voluntary assumption of the risk. Microsoft also argued that Ticketmaster had breached an unwritten Internet code, under which any website operator has the right to link to anyone else's site. A number of articles in the trade press derided Ticketmaster's suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/may97/media/media970506.html |title=SALON &amp;#124; Media Circus |website=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000130101229/http://www.salon.com/may97/media/media970506.html |archivedate=January 30, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The case was settled in February 1999, on confidential terms; Microsoft stopped the deep linking and instead used a link to Ticketmaster's home page.

A later case, ''[[Ticketmaster Corp. v. Tickets.com, Inc.]]'' (2000), yielded a ruling in favour of deep linking.

====''Kelly v. Arriba Soft''====
The first important US decision in this field was that of the Ninth Circuit in ''[[Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corporation|Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp.]]''&lt;ref&gt;336 F.3d 811 (9th Cir. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly complained, among other things, that Arriba's search engine used thumbnails to deep link to images on his Web page. The court found that Arriba's use was highly transformative,&lt;ref&gt;See article on [[Transformativeness]].&lt;/ref&gt; in that it made available to Internet users a functionality not previously available, and that was not otherwise readily provided — an improved way to search for images (by using visual cues instead of verbal cues). This factor, combined with the relatively slight economic harm to Kelly, tipped the [[fair use]] balance decisively in Arriba's favor.

As in other cases, Kelly objected to linking because it caused users to bypass his home page and intervening pages. He was unable, however, to show substantial economic harm. Kelly argued largely that the part of the copyright statute violated was the public display right ({{usc|17|106}}(5)).&lt;ref&gt;Kelly's position, as crystallized at the final stages of the appeal, was that an unauthorized public display occurred (or the conduct was not fair use) because Arriba was changing the ''context'' of Kelly's art works. Kelly had wanted to present them in a particular format and setting, but Arriba altered that by deep linking (linking well beyond Kelly's home page) directly to the images and presenting them in a different manner than the one that Kelly had chosen for them. (Arriba both in-line linked and deep linked.) The position that ''changing context = copyright infringement'' was perhaps best articulated in the brief of Kelly's amicus, the American Society of Media Photographers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; He was aware of the difficulties under the reproduction and distribution provisions (17 U.S.C. §§ 106(1) and (3)), which require proof that the accused infringer trafficked in copies of the protected work. The court focused on the fair use defense, however, under which it ruled in Arriba's favor.

====''Perfect 10 v. Amazon''====
In ''[[Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;487 F.3d 701 (9th Cir. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; the Ninth Circuit again considered whether an image search engine's use of thumbnail was a [[fair use]]. Although the facts were somewhat closer than in the ''Arriba Soft'' case, the court nonetheless found the accused infringer's use fair because it was "highly transformative." The court explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We conclude that the significantly transformative nature of Google's search engine, particularly in light of its public benefit, outweighs Google's superseding and commercial uses of the thumbnails in this case. … We are also mindful of the Supreme Court's direction that "the more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, the court specifically addressed the copyright status of linking, in the first US appellate decision to do so:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Google does not…display a copy of full-size infringing photographic images for purposes of the Copyright Act when Google frames in-line linked images that appear on a user's computer screen. Because Google's computers do not store the photographic images, Google does not have a copy of the images for purposes of the Copyright Act. In other words, Google does not have any "material objects…in which a work is fixed…and from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated" and thus cannot communicate a copy. Instead of communicating a copy of the image, Google provides HTML instructions that direct a user's browser to a website publisher's computer that stores the full-size photographic image. Providing these HTML instructions is not equivalent to showing a copy. First, the HTML instructions are lines of text, not a photographic image. Second, HTML instructions do not themselves cause infringing images to appear on the user's computer screen. The HTML merely gives the address of the image to the user's browser. The browser then interacts with the computer that stores the infringing image. It is this interaction that causes an infringing image to appear on the user's computer screen. Google may facilitate the user's access to infringing images. However, such assistance raised only contributory liability issues and does not constitute direct infringement of the copyright owner's display rights. …While in-line linking and framing may cause some computer users to believe they are viewing a single Google webpage, the Copyright Act, unlike the Trademark Act, does not protect a copyright holder against acts that cause consumer confusion.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====State of US law after ''Arriba Soft'' and ''Perfect 10''====
The ''Arriba Soft'' case stood for the proposition that deep linking and actual reproduction in reduced-size copies (or preparation of reduced-size derivative works) were both excusable as fair use because the defendant's use of the work did not actually or potentially divert trade in the marketplace from the first work; and also it provided the public with a previously unavailable, very useful function of the kind that copyright law exists to promote (finding desired information on the Web).  The ''Perfect 10'' case involved similar considerations, but more of a balancing of interests was involved. The conduct was excused because the value to the public of the otherwise unavailable, useful function outweighed the impact on Perfect 10 of Google's possibly superseding use.

Moreover, in ''Perfect 10'', the court laid down a far-reaching precedent in favor of linking and framing, which the court gave a complete pass under copyright.  It concluded that "in-line linking and framing may cause some computer users to believe they are viewing a single Google webpage, [but] the Copyright Act . . . does not protect a copyright holder against acts that cause consumer confusion."

A February 2018 summary judgement from the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|District Court for the Southern District of New York]] created a new challenge to the established cases. In ''Goldman v. Breitbart'', Justin Goldman, a photographer, posted his on-the-street photograph of [[Tom Brady]] with [[Boston Celtics]] GM [[Danny Ainge]] and others to [[Snapchat]], which became viral over social media such as [[Twitter]] on rumors that Brady was helping with the Celtics' recruitment. Several news organizations subsequently published stories embedding the tweets with Goldman's photograph in the stories. Goldman took legal action against nine of these news agencies, claiming they violated his copyright. Judge Katherine Forrest decided in favor of Goldman and asserting the news sites violated his copyright, rejecting elements of the ''Perfect 10'' ruling. Forrest said that as the news agencies had to take specific steps to embed the tweets with the photograph in their stories, wrote the stories to highlight those, and otherwise was not providing an automated service like Google's search engine. Forrest still expects to review the potential liability that the news agencies may have, where issues such as fair use and the DMCA may be applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/judge-rules-news-publishers-violated-copyright-by-embedding-tweets-tom-brady-photo-1085342 | title = Judge Rules News Publishers Violated Copyright by Embedding Tweets of Tom Brady Photo | first = Eriq | last = Gardner | date = February 16, 2018 | accessdate = February 16, 2018 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cozy Bear''', classified as [[advanced persistent threat]] '''APT29''', is a [[Russia]]n [[hacker group]] believed to be associated with Russian intelligence. The Dutch [[AIVD]] deduced from security camera footage that it is led by the Russian [[Foreign Intelligence Service]] (SVR).&lt;ref name=volkskrant/&gt; Cybersecurity firm [[CrowdStrike]] also previously suggested that it may be associated with either the Russian [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB) or SVR.&lt;ref name ="fsb"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alperovitch|first1=Dmitri|title=Bears in the Midst: Intrusion into the Democratic National Committee|url=https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/|website=CrowdStrike Blog|accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was given other nicknames by other cybersecurity firms, including '''Office Monkeys''', '''CozyCar''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who Is COZY BEAR?|url=https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/who-is-cozy-bear/|work=CrowdStrike|date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''The Dukes''' (by Volexity), and '''CozyDuke'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=F-Secure Study Links CozyDuke to High-Profile Espionage|url=https://www.f-secure.com/en/web/press_global/news-clippings/-/journal_content/56/1075444/1229794|format=Press Release|accessdate=6 January 2017|date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyberattacks Linked to Russian Intelligence Gathering|url=https://www.f-secure.com/en/web/press_global/news/news-archive/-/journal_content/56/1075444/1360080?p_p_auth=M8oOtW07&amp;refererPlid=910425|publisher=F-Secure|accessdate=6 January 2017|format=Press Release|date=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (by [[F-Secure]]).

==Methods and technical capability==
[[File:APT28 APT29 Techniques - Spearphising.png|thumb|Diagram outlining Cozy Bear and [[Fancy Bear]]'s  process of using of malware to penetrate targets]]
Kaspersky Lab determined that the earliest samples of Miniduke are from 2008.&lt;ref name="Threat"/&gt; The original Miniduke malware was written in [[Assembly language|assembler]].&lt;ref name="Securelist2"/&gt; Symantec believes that Cozy Bear had been compromising diplomatic organizations and governments since at least 2010.&lt;ref name="Symantec"/&gt; Cozy Bear appears to have different projects, with different user groups. The focus of its project "Nemesis Gemina" is military, government, energy, diplomatic and telecom sectors.&lt;ref name="Securelist2"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Kaspersky Lab's Global Research &amp; Analysis Team|title=Miniduke is back: Nemesis Gemina and the Botgen Studio|url=https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/64107/miniduke-is-back-nemesis-gemina-and-the-botgen-studio/|work=Securelist|date=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CozyDuke malware utilises a [[Backdoor_(computing)|backdoor]] and a [[Dropper_(malware)|dropper]]. The malware exfiltrates data to a command and control server. Attackers may tailor the malware to the environment.&lt;ref name="Threat"/&gt; The backdoor components of Cozy Bear's malware are updated over time with modifications to [[cryptography]], trojan functionality, and anti-detection. The speed at which Cozy Bear develops and deploys its components is reminiscent of the toolset of Fancy Bear, which also uses the [[Programming tool|tools]] CHOPSTICK and CORESHELL.&lt;ref name="Securelist"/&gt;

Cozy Bear's CozyDuke malware toolset is structurally and functionally similar to second stage components used in early Miniduke, Cosmicduke, and OnionDuke operations. A second stage module of the CozyDuke malware, Show.dll, appears to have been built onto the same platform as OnionDuke, suggesting that the authors are working together or are the same people.&lt;ref name="Securelist"/&gt; The campaigns and the malware toolsets they use are referred to as the Dukes, including Cosmicduke, Cozyduke, and Miniduke.&lt;ref name="Symantec"/&gt; CozyDuke is connected to the MiniDuke and CosmicDuke campaigns, as well as to the OnionDuke cyberespionage campaign. Each threat group tracks their targets and use toolsets that were likely created and updated by Russian speakers.&lt;ref name="Threat"/&gt; Following exposure of the MiniDuke in 2013, updates to the malware were written in [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]] and it was packed with a new [[Obfuscation (software)|obfuscator]].&lt;ref name="Securelist2"/&gt;

Cozy Bear is suspected of being behind the 'HAMMERTOSS' [[Remote administration software#RAT trojan horses|remote access tool]] which uses commonly visited websites like [[Twitter]] and [[GitHub]] to [[Command and control (malware)|relay command data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[FireEye]] |title=HAMMERTOSS: Stealthy Tactics Define a Russian Cyber Threat Group|url=https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/07/hammertoss_stealthy.html|accessdate=7 August 2015|date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seaduke is a highly configurable, low-profile [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan]] only used for a small set of high-value targets. Typically, Seaduke is installed on systems already infected with the much more widely distributed CozyDuke.&lt;ref name="Symantec"&gt;{{cite news|title=“Forkmeiamfamous”: Seaduke, latest weapon in the Duke armory|url=https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/forkmeiamfamous-seaduke-latest-weapon-duke-armory|work=Symantec Security Response|date=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacks==
Evidence suggests that Cozy Bear's targets have included commercial entities and government organizations in Germany, Uzbekistan, South Korea and the USA, including the [[US State Department]] and the [[White House]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="Securelist"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baumgartner|first1=Kurt|last2=Raiu|first2=Costin|title=The CozyDuke APT|url=https://securelist.com/blog/research/69731/the-cozyduke-apt/|publisher=Securelist|date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Office monkeys (2014)===
In March 2014, a Washington, D.C.-based private research institute was found to have Cozyduke (Trojan.Cozer) on their network. Cozy Bear then started an email campaign attempting to lure victims into clicking on a flash video of office monkeys that would also include malicious executables.&lt;ref name="Symantec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Threat"&gt;{{cite news|title=MiniDuke relation ‘CozyDuke’ Targets White House|url=https://threatintelligencetimes.com/2015/04/27/miniduke-relation-cozyduke-targets-white-house/|work=Threat Intelligence Times|date=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July the group had compromised government networks and directed Cozyduke-infected systems to install Miniduke onto a compromised network.&lt;ref name="Symantec"/&gt;

In the summer of 2014, digital agents of the Dutch [[General Intelligence and Security Service]] infiltrated Cozy Bear. They found that these Russian hackers were targeting the US Democratic Party, State Department and White House. Their evidence influenced the FBI’s decision to open an investigation.&lt;ref name=volkskrant&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/media/dutch-agencies-provide-crucial-intel-about-russia-s-interference-in-us-elections~a4561913/|title=Dutch agencies provide crucial intel about Russia's interference in US-elections|date=25 January 2018|author=Huib Modderkolk|newspaper=de Volkskrant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pentagon (August 2015)===
In August 2015 Cozy Bear was linked to a [[spear-phishing]] [[cyber-attack]] against the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] [[email]] system causing the shut down of the entire Joint Staff unclassified email system and Internet access during the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kube|first1=Courtney|title=Russia hacks Pentagon computers: NBC, citing sources|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/06/russia-hacks-pentagon-computers-nbc-citing-sources.html|accessdate=7 August 2015|date=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Starr|first1=Barbara|title=Official: Russia suspected in Joint Chiefs email server intrusion|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/05/politics/joint-staff-email-hack-vulnerability/|accessdate=7 August 2015|date=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic National Committee (2016)===
In June 2016, Cozy Bear was implicated alongside the hacker group [[Fancy Bear]] in the [[Democratic National Committee cyber attacks]].&lt;ref name = "fsb"/&gt; While the two groups were both present in the [[Democratic National Committee]]'s servers at the same time, they appeared to be unaware of the other, each independently stealing the same passwords and otherwise duplicating their efforts.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt; A CrowdStrike forensic team determined that while Cozy Bear had been on the DNC's network for over a year, Fancy Bear had only been there a few weeks.&lt;ref name="Esq"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Vicky|authorlink1=Vicky Ward|title=The Man Leading America's Fight Against Russian Hackers Is Putin's Worst Nightmare|url=http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a49902/the-russian-emigre-leading-the-fight-to-protect-america/|work=Esquire|date=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cozy Bear's more sophisticated tradecraft and interest in traditional long-term espionage suggest that the group originates from a separate Russian intelligence agency.&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;{{cite news|title=Bear on bear|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21707574-whats-worse-being-attacked-russian-hacker-being-attacked-two-bear-bear|accessdate=14 December 2016|work=The Economist|date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===US think tanks and NGOs (2016)===
After the [[United States presidential election, 2016]], Cozy Bear was linked to a series of coordinated and well-planned spear phishing campaigns against U.S.-based think tanks and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PowerDuke: Widespread Post-Election Spear Phishing Campaigns Targeting Think Tanks and NGOs |work=Volexity |date=November 9, 2016 |url=https://www.volexity.com/blog/2016/11/09/powerduke-post-election-spear-phishing-campaigns-targeting-think-tanks-and-ngos/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norwegian Government (2017)===
On February 3, 2017, the [[Norwegian Police Security Service]] (PST) reported that attempts had been made to spearphish the email accounts of nine individuals in the [[Ministry of Defence (Norway)|Ministry of Defence]], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], and the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]]. The acts were attributed to Cozy Bear, whose targets included the [[Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority]], PST section chief Arne Christian Haugstøyl, and an unnamed college. Prime Minister [[Erna Solberg]] called the acts "a serious attack on our democratic institutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stanglin|first1=Doug|title=Norway: Russian hackers hit spy agency, defense, Labour party|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/02/03/norway-russian-hackers-hit-spy-agency-defense-labour-party/97441782/|work=USA Today|date=February 3, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attacks were reportedly conducted in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Norge utsatt for et omfattende hackerangrep|date=February 3, 2017 |work=NRK |url=https://www.nrk.no/norge/norge-utsatt-for-et-omfattende-hackerangrep-1.13358988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch ministries (2017)===
In February 2017, it was revealed that Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear had made several attempts to hack into Dutch ministries, including the [[Ministry of General Affairs]], over the previous six months. [[Rob Bertholee]], head of the AIVD, said on ''[[EenVandaag]]'' that the hackers were Russian and had tried to gain access to secret government documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Modderkolk|first1=Huib|title=Russen faalden bij hackpogingen ambtenaren op Nederlandse ministeries |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/tech/russische-hackers-probeerden-binnen-te-dringen-bij-ministerie-algemene-zaken~a4457869/|work=De Volkskrant|date=February 4, 2017|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a briefing to parliament, Dutch Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations [[Ronald Plasterk]] announced that votes for the [[Dutch general election, 2017|Dutch general election]] in March 2017 would be counted by hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cluskey|first1=Peter|title=Dutch opt for manual count after reports of  Russian hacking|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/dutch-opt-for-manual-count-after-reports-of-russian-hacking-1.2962777|work=The Irish Times|date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8580">[[File:El Libertador Simón Bolívar, Firmando el Decreto de GUERRA A MUERTE contra los Españoles.jpg|thumb|324x324px|[[Simón Bolívar]] signs the Decree of War to the Death in 1813, during his [[Admirable Campaign]].]]
The '''Decree of War to the Death''', in Spanish '''''Decreto de Guerra a Muerte''''', was a decree issued by the South American independentist leader, [[Simón Bolívar]], which permitted [[Laws of war|murder and any atrocities]] whatsoever to be committed against civilians born in [[Spain]] (or the [[Canary Islands]]), other than those actively assisting South American independence, and furthermore exonerated Latin Americans who had already committed such murders and atrocities. The phrase "War to the Death" was used as a [[euphemism]] for these atrocities.

The decree was an explicit "war of extermination" in Bolívar's attempt to maintain Venezuelan independence in the war with Spain, since he felt that the [[Spanish Army]]'s use of atrocities against those who supported the [[First Republic of Venezuela]] had contributed decisively to its defeat.&lt;ref name=Arana&gt;Arana, M. (2013). ''Bolivar''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, {{ISBN|9781439110195}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|142-143}}

Bolívar promulgated the decree on June 15, 1813 in the Venezuelan city of [[Trujillo, Trujillo|Trujillo]].

==Background==
The decree states that it was created as a response to severe crimes and massacres by [[Spain|Spanish]] soldiers after the fall of the First Republic, in which Spanish leaders allegedly stole property and executed thousands of Republicans: "we could not indifferently watch the afflictions inflicted to you by the barbaric Spaniards, who have annihilated you with robbery and destroyed you with death, infringed the most solemn treaties and capitulations [a reference to the San Mateo Capitulation, 1812]; in one word, committed every crime, reducing the Republic of Venezuela to the most horrific desolation." It proclaimed that all [[Peninsulares|Peninsular people]] in Spanish America who didn't actively participate in favor of its independence would be killed, and all South Americans would be spared, even if they had cooperated with the Spanish authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Stoan, ''Pablo Morillo'', 47-50.&lt;/ref&gt; (See below for full declaration). The document's ultimate goal was to assure the Venezuelan elites that they would not be unfavorably treated for having collaborated with [[Juan Domingo de Monteverde|Domingo de Monteverde]] and the royalist authorities. The Decree was the first step in transforming the common and legal view of the Venezuelan war of liberation from a mere [[Insurgency|rebellion]] (or at best a [[civil war]]) taking place in one of [[Spain]]'s [[colony|colonies]], to a full-fledged international [[war]] between two distinct [[country|countries]], Venezuela and Spain.

==Practice of the "''Guerra a Muerte''"==
This  so-called ''Guerra a Muerte'', (War to Death) was widely practised on both sides, making way for some extreme brutalities on both sides, such as the execution of Spanish prisoners in [[Caracas]] and [[La Guaira]] in February 1814, on orders from Bolívar himself, just before the collapse of the [[Second Republic of Venezuela]], and the killing of several renowned citizens in [[United Provinces of New Granada|New Granada]] by the royalist army under [[Pablo Morillo]] in 1815, 1816 and 1817.

The status imposed by the Declaration lasted until November 26, 1820, when General [[Pablo Morillo]] met with Bolívar at [[Santa Ana de Trujillo]] to declare the war of independence a conventional war.

== Text of the Decree ==
{{Copy section to Wikisource}}
Note: The term "Americans" here means natives of the American continent.

"''Venezuelans: an army of brothers, sent by the sovereign [[Congress]] of [[United Provinces of New Granada|New Granada]], has come to free you, and it is already amongst you, after evicting the oppressors from the provinces of [[Mérida (state)|Mérida]] and [[Trujillo (state)|Trujillo]].

''We are the ones sent to destroy the [[Peninsulares|Spaniards]], to protect the Americans, and to reestablish the [[republic]]an governments that formed the [[Confederation]] of [[First Republic of Venezuela|Venezuela]]. The states covering our arms (weapons) are once again ruled by their old [[constitution]]s and [[magistrate]]s, fully enjoying their liberty and independence; for our mission is only to break the chains of servitude, which still oppress some of our peoples, not claiming to create laws, or enforce acts of domination, which the right of war could authorize us to do.

''Touched by your misfortunes, we could not indifferently watch the afflictions inflicted to you by the barbaric Spaniards, who have annihilated you with robbery and destroyed you with death, infringed the most solemn treaties and capitulations; in one word, committed every crime, reducing the Republic of Venezuela to the most horrific desolation. It is so that justice demands vindication, and necessity forces us to take it. May the monsters that infest [[Americas|Colombian]] soil, and have covered it with blood disappear for good; may their punishment be equal to the magnitude of their treason, so that the stain of our [[shame|ignominy]] is washed off, and to show the nations of the universe that the sons of America cannot be offended without punishment.

''In spite of our just resentments against the iniquitous Spaniards, our magnanimity still deigns itself to open, for the last time, a route to conciliation and friendship; we still invite them to live peacefully among us, if, hating their crimes and turning to good faith, they cooperate with us in the destruction of the intruding government of Spain, and the reestablishment of the Republic of Venezuela.

''All Spaniards who do not conspire against tyranny in favor of our just cause, using the most effective and active resources, will be considered enemies, and will be punished as traitors to the homeland, and therefore, will be promptly executed. On the other hand, a general and absolute pardon is issued to all Spaniards who pass into our army, with or without their weapons; to those who offer aid to the good citizens working hard to shake off the shackles of tyranny. War officers and magistrates that proclaim the government of Venezuela and join our cause will keep their destinies and work positions; in one word, all Spaniards who perform service for the State will be reputed and treated as Americans.

''And you, Americans, who have been separated from the road of justice by error and perfidy, know that your brothers forgive you and seriously regret your misdeeds, intimately persuaded that you cannot be guilty, and that only the ignorance and blindness imposed on you by the authors of your crimes could cause you to perpetrate them. Do not fear the sword that comes to avenge you and cut the ignominious bindings which tie you to your executioners' fate. Rely on absolute immunity for your honor, life and properties; the mere title of Americans will be you warranty and safeguard. Our weapons have come to protect you, and will never be used against a single one of our brothers.

''This amnesty extends to the very traitors who have most recently committed their acts of [[felony]]; and will be so religiously carried out that no reason, cause or pretext will be enough to make us break our offer, no matter how extraordinary the reasons you give us to excite our adversity.

''Spaniards and Canarians, count on death, even if indifferent, if you do not actively work in favor of the independence of America. Americans, count on life, even if guilty.''"

'''Directive 98/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 1998 on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions''' 
is a [[European Union directive]] in the field of patent law, made under the [[Single European market|internal market]] 
provisions of the [[Treaty of Rome]]. It was intended to harmonise the laws of Member States regarding the [[patentability]] 
of [[Biotechnology|biotechnological]] [[invention]]s, including [[Plant variety (law)|plant varieties (as legally defined)]] and [[Human gene|human]] [[Gene patent|genes]].

== Content ==
The Directive is divided into the following five chapters:
  
* Patentability (Chapter I)
* Scope of Protection (Chapter II)
* Compulsory cross-licensing (Chapter III)
* Deposit, access and re-deposit of biological material (Chapter IV)
* Final Provisions (entering into force) (Chapter V)

==Timeline==
The original proposal was adopted by the [[European Commission]] in 1988. The procedure for its adoption was slowed down by primarily [[ethics|ethical]] issues regarding the patentability of living matter. The [[European Parliament]] eventually rejected the joint text from the final [[Conciliation]] meeting at 3rd reading on 1 March 1995 so the first directive process did not yield a directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/prelex/detail_dossier_real.cfm?CL=en&amp;DosId=100993 |title=EURLex – 100993 – EN – EUR-Lex |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 13 December 1995, the Commission adopted a new proposal was nearly identical to the rejected version, was changed again, but the Parliament put aside its ethical concerns on patenting of human genes in on 12 July 1998 in its second reading and adopted the Common Position of the [[Council of the European Union|Council]], so in the second legislative process, the directive was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/omk/omnsapir.so/calendar?APP=PDF&amp;TYPE=PV1&amp;FILE=19980512EN.pdf&amp;LANGUE=EN |title=Part 1 : Proceedings of the sitting |publisher=European Parliament |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/prelex/detail_dossier_real.cfm?CL=en&amp;DosId=11643 |title=EURLex – 11643 – EN – EUR-Lex |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drafts person of the Parliament for this second procedure was [[Willi Rothley]] and the vote with the most yes votes was Amendment 9 from the Greens which got 221 against 294 votes out of 532 members voting
with 17 abstentions but 314 yes votes would have been required to reach the required an absolute majority to adopt it.

On 6 July 1998, a final version was adopted. Its code is 98/44/EC.

The [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] brought Case C-377/98&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.curia.europa.eu/en/actu/activites/act01/0125en.htm#ToC1]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819165356/http://www.curia.europa.eu/en/actu/activites/act01/0125en.htm#ToC1 |date=19 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before the [[European Court of Justice]] against the adoption of the directive with six different pleas but the Court granted none of them.  

Nevertheless, the ECJ decision does not preclude a further test of the validity of the directive on the ground that it is inconsistent with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/t_agm0_e.htm |title=intellectual property (TRIPS) – agreement text – contents |publisher=WTO |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art. 27.1 TRIPS provides that patents are only to be granted with respect to 'inventions'.  The directive, however, provides that "biological material which is isolated from its natural environment ... may be the subject of an invention even if it previously occurred in nature."  It is clearly arguable that merely isolating a human gene or protein from its natural environment is not an activity that can come within the meaning of the word 'invention'.  The Danish Council of Bioethics in its Patenting Human Genes and Stem Cells Report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etiskraad.dk/sw475.asp]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010131657/http://www.etiskraad.dk/sw475.asp |date=10 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that "In the members' view, it cannot be said with any reasonableness that a sequence or partial sequence of a gene ceases to be part of the human body merely because an identical copy of the sequence is isolated from or produced outside of the human body."  TRIPS applies to the European Community as it is a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in its own right and accordingly must ensure "the conformity of its laws, regulations and administrative procedures with obligations as provided" by the WTO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/04-wto_e.htm |title=legal texts – Marrakesh agreement |publisher=WTO |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 14 January 2002, the Commission submitted an assessment of the implications for basic genetic engineering research of failure to publish, or late publication of, papers on subjects which could be patentable as required under Article 16(b) of this directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/prelex/detail_dossier_real.cfm?CL=en&amp;DosId=170903 |title=EURLex – 170903 – EN – EUR-Lex |publisher=European Commission |date=14 January 2002 |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Campaigning and lobbying==
According to [[SmithKline Beecham]] lobbyist Simon Gentry, the company allocated 30 million [[European Currency Unit|ECU]] for a pro-Directive campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corporateeurope.org/observer1/patents.html ''Industry and the EU Life Patent Directive''], Corporate Europe Observer, Issue 1, May 1998, citing ECOBP, "''The Big Mirage: The Misuse of the Patient with Hereditary Diseases Before the EP's Vote in 1997''" an ECOBP Background Paper, March 1998, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this campaign was direct support of patient charities and organisations. On the day of the July 1997 vote, a number of people in wheelchairs from these groups demonstrated outside the main hall in Strasbourg, chanting the pharmaceutical industry's slogan, "No Patents, No Cure" in an emotional appeal to Parliamentarians to vote for the Directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simpson |first=Alan |url=http://www.thecornerhouse.org.uk/resource/no-patents-life#index-02-00-00-00 |title=No Patents on Life |publisher=The Corner House |date=1 September 1997 |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==
As of 15 January 2007, all of the 27 EU member states had implemented the Directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/indprop/docs/invent/state-of-play_en.pdf |format=PDF |title=State of Play of the Implementation of Directive 98/44/EC |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37325">A '''drug policy''' is the [[policy]], usually of a government,&lt;ref&gt;Entities at all levels, from international organisations, national governments, local government departments, down to individual night clubs, may have stated drug policies.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding the control and regulation of drugs considered dangerous, particularly those that are [[Drug addiction|addictive]]. Governments try to combat drug addiction with policies that address both the [[Demand (economics)|demand]] and [[Supply (economics)|supply]] of drugs, as well as policies that  mitigate the harms of drug abuse, and for medical treatment. [[Demand reduction]] measures include [[Prohibition (drugs)|prohibition]], [[Sanctions (law)|fines]] for drug offenses, [[incarceration]] for persons convicted for drug offenses, treatment (such as voluntary [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]], coercive care,&lt;ref name="Tännsjö1999"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or supply on medical prescription for drug abusers), awareness campaigns, community social services, and support for families. Supply side reduction involves measures such as enacting [[foreign policy]] aimed at eradicating the international cultivation of plants used to make drugs and interception of [[drug trafficking]]. Policies that help mitigate drug abuse include [[needle exchange]] and drug substitution programs, and free facilities for testing a drug's purity.

Drugs subject to control vary from [[jurisdiction]] to jurisdiction. For example, [[heroin]] is regulated almost everywhere; substances such as [[Khat|qat]], [[codeine]] are regulated in some places,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.grapeshisha.com/plan-your-trip/banned-drugs-in-dubai-and-abu-dhabi.html |title=Banned Drugs in Dubai and Abu Dhabi (codeine and Tamiflu are included) |access-date=2014-06-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323123135/http://www.grapeshisha.com/plan-your-trip/banned-drugs-in-dubai-and-abu-dhabi.html |archive-date=2014-03-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but not others.

Most jurisdictions also regulate [[prescription drug]]s, medicinal drugs not considered dangerous but that can only be supplied to holders of a medical prescription, and sometimes drugs available without prescription but only from an approved supplier such as a [[pharmacy]], but this is not usually described as a "drug policy".

==International treaties==
The [[International Opium Convention]], signed in 1912 during the First International Opium Conference, was the first international drug control treaty. It went into force globally in 1919 when it was incorporated into the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919. A revised Convention was registered in [[League of Nations]] [[Treaty Series]] in 1928. It also imposed some restrictions—not total prohibition—on the export of Indian hemp (''[[cannabis sativa]] forma indica''). In 1961 it was superseded by the international [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] to control global drug trading and use. The Convention banned countries from treating addicts by prescribing illegal substances, allowing only scientific and medical uses of drugs. It did not detail precise drug laws and was not itself binding on countries, which had to pass their own legislation in conformance with the principles of the Convention.&lt;ref name=beebscond&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-london/A47232588 BBC: The UK's Misuse of Drugs Act (1971), 19 February 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
{{further information|Illicit drug use in Australia}}
Australian drug laws are criminal laws and mostly exist at the state and territory level, not the federal, and are therefore different, which means an analysis of trends and laws for Australia is complicated. The federal jurisdiction has enforcement powers over national borders.

In October 2016, Australia legislated for some medicinal use cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-29/medicinal-marijuana-to-become-legal-explainer/7975194 |title=Medicinal marijuana to become legal to grow in Australia — but how will it work? |first=Penny |last=Timms |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=28 October 2016 |accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bolivia ===
Like Colombia, the Bolivian government signed onto the ATPA in 1991 and called for the forced eradication of the coca plant in the 1990s and early 2000s. Until 2004, the government allowed each residential family to grow 1600m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of coca crop, enough to provide the family with a monthly minimum wage.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Drug Policies and the Politics of Drugs in the Americas|last=Grisaffi|first=Thomas|publisher=Springer International Publishing|year=2016|isbn=978-3-319-29080-5|location=|pages=149–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Bolivia saw another reformist movement. The leader of a coca grower group, [[Evo Morales]], was elected President in 2005. Morales ended any U.S. backed War on Drugs. President Morales opposed the decriminalization of drugs but saw the coca crop as an important piece of indigenous history and a pillar of the community because of the traditional use of chewing coca leaves.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2009, the Bolivian Constitution backed the legalization and industrialization of coca products.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Colombia ===
[[File:Coca_leaf_hoja_colombia_crista_castellanos.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Coca_leaf_hoja_colombia_crista_castellanos.JPG|thumb|coca plant]]
Under [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]], the United States declared War on Drugs in the late 1980s; the Colombian drug lords were widely viewed as the root of the cocaine issue in America. In the 1990s, Colombia was home to the world's two largest drug cartels: the Cali cartel and the Medellín cartel.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Drug Policies and the Politics of Drugs in the Americas|last=Uprimny, Rodrigo; Esther Guzmán, Diana|first=|publisher=Springer International Publishing|year=2016|isbn=978-3-319-29082-9|location=|pages=87–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became Colombia's priority, as well as the priority of the other countries in the Andean Region, to extinguish the cartels and drug trafficking from the region. In 1999, under President [[Andrés Pastrana Arango|Andrés Pastrana]], Colombia passed [[Plan Colombia]]. Plan Colombia funded the Andean Region's fight against the drug cartels and drug trafficking. With the implementation of Plan Colombia, the Colombian government aimed to destroy the coca crop. This prohibitionist regime has had controversial results, especially on human rights. Colombia has seen a significant decrease in coca cultivation. In 2001, there were 362,000 acres of coca crop in Colombia; by 2011, fewer than 130,000 acres remained.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, farmers who cultivated the coca crop for uses other than for the creation of cocaine, such as the traditional use of chewing coca leaves, became impoverished.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Since 1994, consumption of drugs has been decriminalized. However, possession and trafficking of drugs are still illegal. In 2014, Colombia further eased its prohibitionist stance on the coca crop by ceasing aerial fumigation of the coca crop and creating programs for addicts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; President [[Juan Manuel Santos]] (2010–present), has called for the revision of Latin American drug policy, and is open to talks about legalization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Ecuador ===
[[File:Narco_submarine_seized_in_Ecuador_2010-07-02_9.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Narco_submarine_seized_in_Ecuador_2010-07-02_9.jpg|thumb|Narco submarine seized in Ecuador]]
In the mid-1980s, under President [[León Febres Cordero|León Febres-Cordero]], Ecuador adopted the prohibitionist drug policy recommended by the United States. By cooperating with the United States, Ecuador received tariff exemptions from the United States. In February 1990, the United States held the Cartagena Drug Summit, in the hopes of continuing progress on the War on Drugs. Three of the four countries in the Andean Region were invited to the Summit: Peru, Colombia and Bolivia, with the notable absence of Ecuador. Two of those three countries—Colombia and Bolivia—joined the Andean Trade Preference Act, later called the [[Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act]], in 1992. Ecuador, along with Peru, would eventually join the ATPA in 1993. The Act united the region in the War on Drugs as well as stimulated their economies with tariff exemptions.

In 1991, President [[Rodrigo Borja Cevallos]] passed Law 108, a law that decriminalized drug use, while continuing to prosecute drug possession. In reality, Law 108 set a trap that snared many citizens. Citizens confused the legality of use with the illegality of carrying drugs on their person. This led to a large increase in prison populations, as 100% of drug crimes were processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Drug Policies and the Politics of Drugs in the Americas|last=Isabel Jácome, Ana; Alvarez Velasco, Carla|first=|publisher=Springer International Publishing|year=2016|isbn=978-3-319-29080-5|location=|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, 18,000 prisoners were kept in a prison built to hold up to 7,000.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nacla.org/article/ecuadors-pardon-laws|title=Ecuador's Pardon Laws|last=Youngers|first=Coletta|date=Sumer 2014|work=NACLA|access-date=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In urban regions of Ecuador as many as 45% of male inmates were serving time for drug charges; this prison demographic rises to 80% of female inmates.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 2008, under Ecuador's new Constitution, current prisoners serving time were allowed the "smuggler pardon" if they were prosecuted for purchasing or carrying up to 2&amp;nbsp;kg of any drug, and they already served 10% of their sentence. Later, in 2009, Law 108 was replaced by the Organic Penal Code (COIP). The COIP contains many of the same rules and regulations as Law 108,  but it established clear distinctions among large, medium and small drug traffickers, as well as between the mafia and rural growers, and prosecutes accordingly.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 2013, the Ecuadorian government left the [[Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act]].

=== Germany ===
{{Main article|Drug policy of Germany}}

Compared with other [[European Union|EU]] countries, [[Germany]]'s drug policy is considered progressive, but still stricter than, for example, the Netherlands. In 1994 the [[Bundesverfassungsgericht|Federal Constitutional Court]] ruled that drug addiction was not a crime, nor was the possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use. In 2000, Germany changed the narcotic law ("BtmG") to allow supervised drug injection rooms. In 2002, they started a pilot study in seven German cities to evaluate the effects of [[heroin-assisted treatment]] on addicts, compared to methadone-assisted treatment. The positive results of the study led to the inclusion of heroin-assisted treatment into the services of the mandatory health insurance in 2009.

===Liberia===
[[Liberia]] prohibits drugs such as cocaine and marijuana. Its drug laws are enforced by the [[Drug Enforcement Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201110040693.html DEA Destroys Over LD$10 Million Drugs], [[AllAfrica.com|AllAfrica]], 2011-10-04. Accessed 2012-06-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands ===
{{main article|Drug policy of the Netherlands}}
[[File:Amsterdam rainbow coffeeshop.jpg|thumb|[[Cannabis coffee shop]] in the city center of [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]]]

Drug policy in the Netherlands is based on two principles: that drug use is a health issue, not a criminal issue, and that there is a distinction between hard and soft drugs.  The Netherlands is currently the only country to have implemented a wide scale, but still regulated, decriminalisation of marijuana. It was also one of the first countries to introduce [[heroin-assisted treatment]] and [[safe injection sites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2219559 | pmid=17562183 | doi=10.1007/s11524-007-9198-y | volume=84 | issue=4 | title=Heroin-assisted treatment (HAT) a decade later: a brief update on science and politics |date=July 2007  |vauthors=Fischer B, Oviedo-Joekes E, Blanken P, etal | journal=J Urban Health | pages=552–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2008, a number of town councils have closed many so called ''coffee shops'' that sold [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] or implemented other new restrictions for sale of cannabis, e.g. for foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/10/24/2400900.htm AFP: Dutch towns close coffee shops in 'drug tourists' crackdown, Oct 24, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/Features/article2035693.ece/Selling_soft_drugs_is_not_a_right_even_in_the_Netherlands |title="Selling soft drugs is not a right even in the Netherlands" |access-date=2011-03-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222031307/http://www.nrc.nl/international/Features/article2035693.ece/Selling_soft_drugs_is_not_a_right_even_in_the_Netherlands |archive-date=2008-12-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Importing and exporting of any classified drug is a serious offence. The penalty can run up to 12 to 16 years if it is for hard drugs, or a maximum of 4 years for importing or exporting large quantities of cannabis. Investment in treatment and prevention of drug addiction is high when compared to the rest of the world. The Netherlands spends significantly more per capita than all other countries in the [[European Union|EU]] on drug law enforcement. 75% of drug-related public spending is on law enforcement. Drug use remains at average Western European levels and slightly lower than in English speaking countries.

===  Peru ===
According to article 8 of the [[Constitution of Peru]], the state is responsible for battling and punishing drug trafficking. Likewise, it regulates the use of intoxicants. Consumption of drugs is not penalized and possession is allowed for small quantities only. Production and distribution of drugs are illegal.

In 1993, Peru, along with Ecuador, signed the Andean Trade Preference Agreement with the United States, later replaced with the [[Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Drug Policies and the Politics of Drugs in the Americas|last=Ponce|first=Aldo F.|publisher=Springer International Publishing|year=2016|isbn=978-3-319-29080-5|location=|pages=123–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolivia and Colombia had already signed the ATPA in 1991, and began enjoying its benefits in 1992.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By agreeing to the terms of this Agreement, these countries worked in concert with the United States to fight drug trafficking and production at the source. The Act aimed to substitute the production of the coca plant with other agricultural products. In return for their efforts towards eradication of the coca plant, the countries were granted U.S. tariff exemptions on certain products, such as certain types of fruit. Peru ceased complying with the ATPA in 2012, and lost all tariff exemptions previously granted by the United States through the ATPA.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By the end of 2012, Peru overtook Colombia as the world's largest cultivator of the coca plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-24234210|title=Peru overtakes Colombia as world's top coca leaf grower|date=2013-09-24|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-04-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portugal===
{{main article|Drug policy of Portugal}}
In July 2001, a law maintained the status of illegality for using or possessing any drug for personal use without authorization. The offense was however changed from a criminal one, with prison a possible punishment, to an administrative one if the possessing was no more than up to ten days' supply of that substance.&lt;ref name="Emdrug"&gt;[http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-policy-profiles/portugal EMCDDA: Drug policy profiles, Portugal, June 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; This was in line with the de facto Portuguese drug policy before the reform. Drug addicts were then aggressively targeted with [[Drug therapy|therapy]] or community service rather than fines or waivers.&lt;ref&gt;"Portugal legalizes drug use". BBC News. 7 July 2000. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/823257.stm. Retrieved 21 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Even if there are no criminal penalties, these changes did not legalize drug use in Portugal. Possession has remained prohibited by Portuguese law, and criminal penalties are still applied to drug growers, dealers and traffickers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beckleyfoundation.org/bib/doc/bf/2007_Caitlin_211672_1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426030351/http://www.beckleyfoundation.org/bib/doc/bf/2007_Caitlin_211672_1.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
Drugs became popular in [[Russia]] among soldiers and the homeless, particularly due to the [[First World War]]. This included [[morphine]]-based drugs and [[cocaine]], which were readily available. The government under Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]] had outlawed alcohol in 1914 (including [[vodka]]) as a temporary measure until the conclusion of the War. Following the [[Russian Revolution]] and in particular the [[October Revolution]] and the [[Russian Civil War]], the [[Bolsheviks]] emerged victorious as the new political power in Russia. The [[Soviet Union]] inherited a population with widespread drug addiction, and in the 1920s, tried to tackle it by introducing a 10-year prison sentence for [[drug-dealers]]. The Bolsheviks also decided in August 1924 to re-introduce the sale of vodka, which, being more readily available, led to a drop in drug-use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rbth.com/politics_and_society/society/2017/08/19/flying-high-how-did-revolutionary-russia-become-drug-addicted_824760|title=Flying high: how did revolutionary Russia become drug-addicted|accessdate=24 November 2017| work=Russia Beyond|  date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
{{main article|Drug policy of Sweden}}
Sweden's drug policy has gradually turned from lenient in the 1960s with an emphasis on drug supply towards a policy of [[zero tolerance]] against all illicit drug use (including [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]). The official aim is a drug-free society. Drug use became a punishable crime in 1988. Personal use does not result in jail time if not combined with driving a car.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawline.se/answers/2867 Lawline: Påföljd vid ringa narkotikabrott, 2007-04-21]&lt;/ref&gt; Prevention includes widespread drug testing, and penalties range from fines for minor drug offenses up to a 10-year prison sentence for aggravated offenses. The condition for suspended sentences could be regular drug tests or submission to [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation treatment]]. Drug treatment is free of charge and provided through the health care system and the municipal social services. Drug use that threatens the health and development of minors could force them into mandatory treatment if they don't apply voluntarily. If the use threatens the immediate health or the security of others (such as a child of an addict) the same could apply to adults.

Among 9th year students, drug experimentation was highest in the early 1970s, falling towards a low in the late 1980s, redoubling in the 1990s to stabilize and slowly decline in 2000s. Estimates of heavy drug addicts have risen from 6000 in 1967 to 15000 in 1979, 19000 in 1992 and 26000 in 1998. According to inpatient data, there were 28000 such addicts in 2001 and 26000 in 2004, but these last two figures may represent the recent trend in Sweden towards out-patient treatment of drug addicts rather than an actual decline in drug addictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.can.se/documents/CAN/Rapporter/rapportserie/CAN-rapportserie-107-drogutvecklingen-i-sverige-2007-summary.pdf CAN:Drug Trends in Sweden 2007, page 7-11]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC) reports that Sweden has one of the lowest drug use rates in the Western world, and attributes this to a drug policy that invests heavily in prevention and treatment as well as strict law enforcement.&lt;ref name="UNODCrep"&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/pdf/research/Swedish_drug_control.pdf UNODC: Sweden's successful drug policy, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The general drug policy is supported by all political parties and, according to opinion polls made in the mid 2000s, the restrictive approach received broad support from the public at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_41400_EN_sv.pdf European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction: National report Sweden, 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911010232/http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_41400_EN_sv.pdf |date=September 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Canada"&gt;[http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/Com-e/ille-e/library-e/gerald-e.htm NATIONAL DRUG POLICY: SWEDEN Prepared for The Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs, Canada 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
The national drug policy of [[Switzerland]] was developed in the early 1990s and comprises the four elements of prevention, therapy, harm reduction and prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drug policy|author=Swiss Federal Office of Public Health|url=http://www.bag.admin.ch/themen/drogen/00042/00624/index.html?lang=en|accessdate=2008-05-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501224221/http://www.bag.admin.ch/themen/drogen/00042/00624/index.html?lang=en|archive-date=2008-05-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 Switzerland was one of the first countries to try heroin-assisted treatment and other [[harm reduction]] measures like supervised injection rooms. In 2008 a [[popular initiative]] by the right wing [[Swiss People's Party]] aimed at ending the heroin program was rejected by more than two thirds of the voters. A simultaneous initiative aimed at legalizing marijuana was rejected at the same ballot.

Between 1987 and 1992, illegal drug use and sales were permitted in [[Platzspitz park]], Zurich, in an attempt to counter the growing heroin problem. However, as the situation grew increasingly out of control, authorities were forced to close the park.

===Thailand===
[[Thailand]] has a strict drug policy. Control of narcotic substances is carried out in accordance with the Law on Combating Drugs of 1979. The use, storage, transportation and distribution of drugs is illegal. The maximum penalty for the distribution or possession of drugs is the death penalty. According to Thai law, drugs are divided into 5 categories&lt;ref&gt;http://thailawforum.com/tourst-guide-laws-Thailand-4.html&lt;/ref&gt;:

I - [[heroin]], amphetamines, methamphetamines.

II - [[morphine]], [[cocaine]], [[ketamine]], [[codeine]], [[opium]] and opium medicinal, methadone.

III - drugs that legally contain category II ingredients.

IV - chemicals used to make categories I and II drugs, such as anhydride and acetyl chloride.

V - [[cannabis]], plant Kratom, a hallucinogenic fungus.

It is also illegal to import more than 200 cigarettes per person to Thailand. Control takes place at customs at the airport. If the limit has been exceeded, the owner can be fined up to ten times the cost of cigarettes.

In January 2018, Thai authorities imposed a ban on smoking on beaches in some tourist areas. Those who smoke in public places can be punished with a fine of 100,000 Baht or imprisonment for up to one year. It is forbidden to import electronic cigarettes into Thailand. These items are likely to be confiscated, and you can be fined or sent to prison for up to 10 years. The sale or supply of electronic cigarettes and similar devices is also prohibited and is punishable by a fine or imprisonment of up to 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/thailand/local-laws-and-customs&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is worth noting that most people arrested for possessing a small amount of substances from the V-th category are fined and not imprisoned. At present, in Thailand, the anti-drug police are considering methamphetamines as a more serious and dangerous problem.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thailawforum.com/history-of-marijuana-cannabis-thailand.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ukraine===
Crimes in the sphere of trafficking in narcotic, psychotropic substances and crimes against health are classified using the 13th section of the Criminal Code of Ukraine; articles from 305 to 327.&lt;ref&gt;https://meget.kiev.ua/kodeks/ugolovniy-kodeks/razdel-1-13/&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to official statistics for 2016, 53% of crimes in the field of drugs fall on art. 309 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: "illegal production, manufacture, acquisition, storage, transportation or shipment of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances or their analogues without the purpose of sale".

'''Sentence for crime'''&lt;ref&gt; http://alfa-omega.kh.ua/otvetstvennost-za-upotreblenie-narkotikov/&lt;/ref&gt; :
* fine of fifty to one hundred non-taxable minimum incomes of citizens;
* or correctional labor for up to two years;
* or arrest for up to six months, or restriction of liberty for up to three years;
* or imprisonment for the same term.

On August 28, 2013, the [[Government of Ukraine|Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine]] adopted a strategy for state policy on drugs until 2020. This is the first document of this kind in Ukraine. The strategy developed by the State Drug Control Service, involves strengthening criminal liability for distributing large amounts of drugs, and easing the penalty for possession of small doses. Thanks to this strategy, it is planned to reduce the number of injecting drug users by 20% by 2020, and the number of drug overdose deaths by 30%.&lt;ref&gt;https://zn.ua/UKRAINE/v-ukraine-vpervye-razrabotana-gosudarstvennaya-strategiya-v-otnoshenii-narkotikov-128148_.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, the State Service of Ukraine on Drugs and Drug Control issued the first license for the import and re-export of raw materials and products derived from cannabis. The corresponding licenses were obtained by the USA company C21. She is also in the process of applying for additional licenses, including the cultivation of hemp.

=== United Kingdom ===
{{Main article|Drug policy of the United Kingdom}}
{{See also|List of drugs illegal in the United Kingdom}}
Drugs considered addictive or dangerous in the United Kingdom (with the exception of tobacco and alcohol) are called "controlled substances" and regulated by law. Until 1964 the medical treatment of dependent drug users was separated from the punishment of unregulated use and supply. This arrangement was confirmed by the [[Rolleston Committee]] in 1926. This policy on drugs, known as the "British system", was maintained in Britain, and nowhere else, until the 1960s. Under this policy drug use remained low; there was relatively little recreational use and few dependent users, who were prescribed drugs by their doctors as part of their treatment. From 1964 drug use was increasingly criminalised, with the framework still in place {{As of|2014|lc=y}} largely determined by the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971|1971 Misuse of Drugs Act]].&lt;ref name=analpol&gt;[http://kar.kent.ac.uk/13332/1/analysis_of_UK_drug_policy.pdf An Analysis of UK Drug Policy - A Monograph Prepared for the UK Drug Policy Commission, Peter Reuter, University of Maryland, Alex Stevens, University of Kent, April 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13–14}}

=== United States ===
{{main article|Drug policy of the United States}}
{{see also|Drug policy of California|Drug policy of Colorado|Drug policy of Maryland|Drug policy of Virginia}}

Modern US drug policy still has roots in the [[war on drugs]] started by president [[Richard Nixon]] in 1971.
In the United States, illegal drugs fall into different categories and punishment for possession and dealing varies on amount and type. Punishment for marijuana possession is light in most states, but punishment for dealing and possession of hard drugs can be severe, and has contributed to the growth of the prison population.

US drug policy is also heavily invested in foreign policy, supporting military and paramilitary actions in South America, Central Asia, and other places to eradicate the growth of [[coca]] and [[opium]]. In Colombia, U.S. president [[Bill Clinton]] dispatched military and paramilitary personnel to interdict the planting of coca, as a part of the [[Plan Colombia]]. The project is often criticized for its ineffectiveness and its negative impact on local farmers. President [[George W. Bush]] intensified anti-drug efforts in [[Mexico]], initiating the [[Mérida Initiative]], but has faced criticisms for similar reasons.

May 21, 2012 the U.S Government published an updated version of its Drug Policy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/policy-and-research/principles-of-modern-drug-policy Principles of Modern Drug Policy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131204005/http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/policy-and-research/principles-of-modern-drug-policy |date=2013-01-31 }}. Whitehouse.gov.&lt;/ref&gt;
The director of [[ONDCP]] stated simultaneously that this policy is something different than "War on Drugs":

*The U.S Government see the policy as a “third way” approach to drug control one that is based on the results of a huge investment in research from some of the world’s preeminent scholars on disease of substance abuse.
*The policy does not see drug legalization as the “silver bullet” solution to drug control.
*It is not a policy where success is measured by the number of arrests made or prisons built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/news-releases-remarks/principles-of-modern-drug-policy-directors-remarks-at-the-world-federation-against-drugs Statement of the Government of the United States of America World Federation Against Drugs 3rd World Forum, May 21, 2012, Stockholm, Sweden] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131204029/http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/news-releases-remarks/principles-of-modern-drug-policy-directors-remarks-at-the-world-federation-against-drugs |date=January 31, 2013 }}. Whitehouse.gov (September 21, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. government generates grants to develop and disseminate evidence based addiction treatments.&lt;ref&gt;Milford, J.L. Austin, J.L. and Smith, J.E.(2007). Community Reinforcement and the Dissemination of Evidence-based Practice: Implications for Public Policy. International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy, 3(1), 77-87 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; These grants have developed several practices that NIDA endorses, such as community reinforcement approach and community reinforcement and family training approach,&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, R.J., Smith, J.E. &amp; Lash, D.N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5166">The '''Family Entertainment and Copyright Act''', Pub. L. 109-9, 119 Stat. 218 (April 27, 2005), is a [[Government of the United States|federal]] [[Act of Congress|legislative act]] regarding [[United States copyright law|copyright]] that became law in the United States in 2005&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/senate-bill/167/text&lt;/ref&gt;.  The Act consists of two subparts: the Artist's Rights and Theft Prevention Act of 2005, which increases penalties for [[copyright infringement]], and the Family Home Movie Act of 2005, which permits the development of technology to "sanitize" potentially offensive DVD and VOD content.  

The Family Entertainment and Copyright Act was introduced into the [[United States Senate]] (of the [[109th United States Congress]]) on January 25, 2005 by Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]] - [[Utah]]), and was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]] on April 27, 2005.

The act provides theater owners and employees with both civil and criminal immunity for questioning suspected violators or detaining them while police are summoned.

== Artist's Rights and Theft Prevention Act of 2005 ==
This act, also known as the "ART Act", is targeted at preventing copyright infringement of movies and software. It specifically targets two activities: filming movies in a movie theater, and early release of movies and software before they become publicly available.

It permits preregistration of certain types of unpublished works if it determines that such works have a history of infringement prior to commercial distribution. The purpose of preregistration is related to potential litigation protection in view of the fact that it allows an infringement action to be brought before the authorized commercial distribution of a work and the work’s full-fledged registration. Preregistration makes possible—only upon full registration—for the copyright owner to receive statutory damages and attorneys’ fees in an infringement action.  Works determined eligible for copyright preregistration are: motion pictures, sound recordings, musical compositions, literary works being prepared as books, computer programs (including videogames), and advertising or marketing photographs.&lt;ref&gt;http://aplegal.com/2014/12/10/copyright-preregistration/&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone who "knowingly uses or attempts to use an audiovisual recording device to transmit or make a copy of a ... protected work... from a performance of such work in a motion picture exhibition facility..." may be imprisoned up to three years for a first time offender, and up to six years for a repeat offender, in addition to any fines that may be levied under the U.S. Criminal Code for copyright infringement. This could apply to merely taking a cell phone snapshot of a theatre screen.

With regard to unreleased works intended for public distribution (e.g., [[beta version|beta software]] or [[workprint]]s), anyone who makes available a work that the copyright owner expects to distribute commercially, but is not yet distributed, shall be punished if the work is "made available on a computer network accessible to members of the public, if such person knew or should have known that the work was intended for commercial distribution." First time offenders can get up to three years in jail, or five if they committed the offense for financial gain. Repeat offenders can get ten years if the offense was committed for financial gain. These penalties are in addition to any penalties for violating [[non-disclosure agreement]]s or [[trade secret]] law.

== Family Home Movie Act of 2005 ==

This section is an exemption of liability allowing the creation of technology that can edit a DVD or transmitted movie on the fly (during playback) and thus present a censored version of that movie.  This provision arose out of a lawsuit between ''[[ClearPlay]]'', a [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]]-based company that markets DVD-sanitizing technology, and a number of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] studios and directors. The ClearPlay technology allows a home consumer to screen out up to 14 different categories of objectionable content, such as drug use, sexual situations, or foul language.  The act is codified in [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/110- 17 U.S.C. 110(11)]

'''''Follett v. Town of McCormick''''', 321 U.S. 573 (1944),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Follett v. Town of McCormick|volume=321|page=573|pin=|year=1944}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that people who earn their living by selling or distributing religious materials should not be required to pay the same licensing fees and taxes as those who sell or distribute non-religious materials.

== Facts of the case ==
Follett was convicted of violating an ordinance of the town of McCormick, South Carolina which provided: '... the following license on business, occupation and professions to be paid by the person or persons carrying on or engaged in such business, occupation or professions within the corporate limits of the Town of McCormick, South Carolina: Agents selling books, per day $1.00, per year $15.00.' Follett was a [[Jehovah's Witness]] and had been certified by the [[Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York|Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society]] as 'an ordained minister of Jehovah God to preach the gospel of God's kingdom under Christ Jesus.' He is a resident of McCormick, South Carolina, where he went from house to house distributing certain books. He obtained his living from the money received; he had no other source of income. He claimed that he merely offered the books for a 'contribution'. But there was evidence that he 'offered to and did sell the books'. He had no license from the town and refused to obtain one.

==Prior history==
At his trial, Follett moved for a directed verdict of not guilty at the close of the evidence, claiming that the ordinance restricted freedom of worship in violation of the First Amendment which the Fourteenth Amendment makes applicable to the States. The motion was overruled and appellant was found guilty by the jury in the Mayor's Court. That judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of General Sessions for McCormick County and then by the [[Supreme Court of South Carolina]].

The Supreme Court of South Carolina recognized the principles established in ''[[Jones v. Opelika]]'' and ''[[Murdock v. Pennsylvania]]'' but had asserted that this case was different from the Murdock and Opelika decisions. It pointed out that Follett was not an itinerant, but was a resident of the town where the canvassing took place, and that the principle of the Murdock decision was applicable only to itinerant preachers. It stated, moreover, that appellant earned his living "by the sale of books," that his "occupation was that of selling books, and not that of colporteur," that "the sales proven were more commercial than religious." It concluded that the "license was required for the selling of books, not for the spreading of religion."

==Decision of the court==
===Majority opinion===
{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}

Justice Douglas delivered the opinion of the Court.  The decision held that the municipal ordinance was violative of the freedom of worship guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments when applied to an evangelist or preacher who distributed religious tracts in his hometown and who made his livelihood from such activity.

===Concurring opinions===
In his concurring opinion, Justice [[Frank Murphy]] addressed concerns that had been raised by the dissenting justices that the majority decision would "[open] the door to exemption of wealthy religious institutions, like Trinity Church in New York City, from the payment of taxes on property investments from which support is derived for religious activities."  Murphy rebutted these arguments by stating that "(t)here is an obvious difference between taxing commercial property and investments undertaken for profit, whatever use is made of the income, and laying a tax directly on an activity that is essentially religious in purpose and character or on an exercise of the privilege of free speech and free publication."

A '''general order''', in military and paramilitary organizations, is a published directive, originated by a commander and binding upon all personnel under his or her command. Its purpose  is to enforce a [[policy]] or [[Procedure (term)|procedure]] unique to the unit's situation that is not otherwise addressed in applicable service regulations, [[military law]], or [[public law]].

A general order has the force of law; it is an offense punishable by [[court martial]] or lesser [[military court]] to disobey one. What makes it a general order (as opposed to a direct order) is that the actor is not explicitly named, nor precisely what (or who) is to be acted upon.

A general order of indefinite duration may be referred to as a ''standing order''. Standing orders are necessarily general and vague since the exact circumstances for execution occur in the future, under unknown conditions. For example, in most military agencies, there is a standing order for enlisted men to [[salute]] officers. The officers are required to return the salute to the enlisted person, but the name of each enlisted man, the name of each officer, and the exact time for the salute are not mentioned in the order.

==List of notable general orders==

===In the United States===
*[[General Orders for Sentries]] – often referred to as the 11 General Orders.
*[[General Order No. 1]]
**General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s first order to the forces of the [[Empire of Japan]] following the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender in World War II]].
**Order applicable to United States military personnel in the [[CENTCOM]] Area of Operations following the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan forbidding various activities such as alcohol consumption, sexual relations, religious promotion, etc.
*General Order No. 9 (or [[Lee's Farewell Address]]) – Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s announcement of his surrender that ended the [[American Civil War]]
*[[General Order No. 11 (1862)]] – an [[American Civil War]] order expelling [[Jew]]s (for suspected black market activities thought to be primarily run by them) from areas of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Kentucky (revoked weeks later)
*[[General Order No. 11 (1863)]] – an [[American Civil War]] order expelling the residents of four [[Missouri]] counties which were then to be burned.
*General Order No. 100
**An [[American Civil War]] order (the [[Lieber Code]]) which expressly forbade giving no quarter to the enemy
**Napoleon's standing order to "March to the sound of the guns" which [[Emmanuel de Grouchy, Marquis de Grouchy|Grouchy]] disobeyed at Waterloo leading to the French defeat.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Grouchy, however, had written and verbal orders from Napoleon to march on Wavre and to engage the Prussians there, and knew that Marshal Ney had been taken to task by Napoleon two days earlier for not following orders at the Battle of Quatre Bras. Grouchy therefore declined to follow his subordinates' suggestion, pointing out that Napoleon had more than enough force to deal with Wellington. Minutes after this conversation, Exelmans reported strong Prussian positions 5 km (3.1 mi) at Wavre. At 13:00, elements of Exelmans' cavalry were in contact with the Prussian 14th Brigade’s rear guard. Further argument was ended by the arrival at 16:00 of another order from Napoleon, repeating the instruction to Grouchy to attack the Prussians before him.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In fiction===
* A set of general orders, including the [[Prime Directive]], has been established in [[Paramount Pictures]]' source [[documentation]] to govern the [[Starfleet]] organization in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[fictional universe]].
** [[General Order № 24]] Destruction of all life on a planet, issued by Captain [[James T. Kirk]] in [[Star Trek]] episode #23 [[A Taste of Armageddon]]. He issued the order on [[stardate]] 3192.1 to be executed "in two hours," targeting [[Eminiar VII]]. Kirk was being held captive on the planet at the time he gave the order. The only recorded instance of this order actually being carried out was the first issue of the non-canon Gold Key Star Trek series: "The Planet of No Return."
* [[General Order № 47]] issued to all [[EarthForce]] personnel requiring them to answer [[distress call]]s and assist any vessel not currently involved in hostilities against [[Earth]] in the ''[[Babylon 5]]'' [[fictional universe]].
* [[Order 66]] Execution of all [[Jedi]] on sight, issued by Chancellor [[Palpatine]] to the [[Clone Troopers|Grand Army of the Republic]] in ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]''. Palpatine issued the order galaxy-wide immediately after evading arrest by the Jedi order and successfully turning [[Anakin Skywalker]] to the dark side of [[the Force]].
* In ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', [[Saavik|Lt. Saavik]] quotes two general orders, General Order 12, in which a ship was to raise its alert level if proper communication had not been established with another vessel in its vicinity, even if it was another [[Starfleet]] vessel, and the second, General Order 15, stated that no [[flag officer]] was to enter a potentially hazardous area without armed escort.

'''Governmentality''' is a concept first developed by the French [[philosopher]] [[Michel Foucault]] in the later years of his life, roughly between 1977 and his death in 1984, particularly in his lectures at the [[Collège de France]] during this time.

The concept has been elaborated further from an "Anglo-Neo Foucauldian" perspective in the social sciences, especially by authors such as Peter Miller, [[Nikolas Rose]], and Mitchell Dean. Governmentality can be understood as:
* the way [[government]]s try to produce the citizen best suited to fulfill those governments' policies
* the organized practices (mentalities, rationalities, and techniques) through which subjects are governed&lt;ref&gt;Mayhew, Susan (ed) ''A Dictionary of Geography'' (Article: Governmentality) Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Governmentality may also be understood as:
* the "art of government"&lt;ref name="burchell1"&gt;{{cite book|title='Governmentality', trans. Rosi Braidotti and revised by Colin Gordon, in Graham Burchell, Colin Gordon and Peter Miller (eds) ''The Foucault Effect: Studies in Governmentality'', pp.&amp;nbsp;87–104.|author=Foucault, M.|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the "how" of governing (that is, the calculated means of directing how we behave and act)&lt;ref name="Jeffreys"&gt;[Jeffreys and Sigley (2009) 'Governmentality, Governance and China' in China's Governmentalities,  (ed.) Elaine Jeffreys, {{ISBN|978-0-415-54744-4}}]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "governmental rationality"&lt;ref name="gordon"&gt;{{cite book|title='Governmental rationality: an introduction', in Graham Burchell, Colin Gordon and Peter Miller (eds) ''The Foucault Effect: Studies in Governmentality'', pp.&amp;nbsp;1–48.|author=Gordon, C|year=1991|publisher=Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "a 'guideline' for the analysis that Michel Foucault offers by way of historical reconstructions embracing a period starting from Ancient Greece right through to modernity and neo-liberalism"&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, '''The Government of Self and Others: Lectures at the Collège de France 1982-1983''' (2010) http://rauli.cbs.dk/index.php/foucault-studies/article/view/3127/3298.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault '''The Courage of Truth : Lectures at the Collège de France 1983-1984''' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault '''The Birth of Biopolitics Lectures At The College de France 1978-1979''' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
* "the techniques and strategies by which a society is rendered governable"&lt;ref&gt;'''Foucault, Governmentality, and Critique'''(2002) {{cite web |url=http://www.andosciasociology.net/resources/Foucault$2C+Governmentality$2C+and+Critique+IV-2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724102830/http://www.andosciasociology.net/resources/Foucault$2C+Governmentality$2C+and+Critique+IV-2.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 'reasoned way of governing best and, at the same time, reflection on the best possible way of governing'&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, M., (2008), ''The birth of biopolitics. Lectures at the College de France, 1978‐79. Palgrave MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semantics==
This term was thought by some commentators to be made by the "...linking of governing ("gouverner") and modes of thought ("mentalité")".&lt;ref name="lemke2"&gt;{{cite book|title='The birth of bio-politics: Michael Foucault's lectures at the College de France on neo-liberal governmentality' in ''Economy and Society'' v.30, i.2, p.&amp;nbsp;190-207|author=Lemke, T|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it was not coined by uniting words "gouvernement" and "mentalité", but simply by making ''gouvernement'' into ''gouvernementalité'' just like ''musical'' into ''musicalité'' [i.e. government + -al- ''adjective'' + -ité ''abstract noun''] (see Michel Senellart's "Course Context" in Foucault's "Security, territory, population" lectures). To fully understand this concept, it is important to realize that in this case, Foucault does not only use the standard, strictly political definition of "governing" or government used today, but he also uses the broader definition of governing or government that was employed until the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 90&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, that in this case, for Foucault, "...'government' also signified problems of self-control, guidance for the family and for children, management of the household, directing the soul, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, 2&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, for our purposes, government is "...the conduct of conduct..."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault in Burchell, 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic definition==
{{original research|date=March 2011}}
In his lectures at the [[Collège de France]], Foucault often defines governmentality as the "art of government" in a wide sense, i.e. with an idea of "government" that is not limited to state politics alone, that includes a wide range of control techniques, and that applies to a wide variety of objects, from one's control of the self to the "biopolitical" control of populations. In the work of Foucault, this notion is indeed linked to other concepts such as [[biopower|biopolitics]] and [[power-knowledge]]. The [[genealogy|genealogical]] exploration of the modern state as "problem of government" does not only deepen Foucault's analyses on sovereignty and biopolitics; it offers an analytics of government which refines both Foucault's theory of power and his understanding of freedom.&lt;ref name="mallette"&gt;{{cite book|title=La "gouvernementalité" chez Michel Foucault. M. A., Faculté de Philosophie|author=Malette S.|year=2006|publisher=Université Laval - Québec|url=http://www.theses.ulaval.ca/2006/23836/23836.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "governmentality" develops a new understanding of power. Foucault encourages us to think of power not only in terms of hierarchical, top-down power of the state. He widens our understanding of power to also include the forms of social control in disciplinary institutions (schools, hospitals, psychiatric institutions, etc.), as well as the forms of knowledge. Power can manifest itself positively by producing knowledge and certain discourses that get internalised by individuals and guide the behaviour of populations. This leads to more efficient forms of social control, as knowledge enables individuals to govern themselves.

"Governmentality" applies to a variety of historical periods and to different specific power regimes. However, it is often used (by other scholars and by Foucault himself) in reference to "neoliberal governmentality", i.e. to a type of governmentality that characterizes advanced liberal democracies. In this case, the notion of governmentality refers to societies where power is de-centered and its members play an active role in their own self-government, e.g. as posited in [[neoliberalism]]. Because of its active role, individuals need to be regulated from 'inside'. A particular form of governmentality is characterized by a certain form of knowledge (''"savoir"'' in French). In the case of neoliberal governmentality (a kind of governmentality based on the predominance of market mechanisms and of the restriction of the action of the state) the knowledge produced allows the construction of auto-regulated or auto-correcting selves.

In his lecture titled Governmentality, Foucault gives us a definition of governmentality:

The ensemble formed by the institutions, procedures, analyses and reflections, the calculations and tactics that allow the exercise of this very specific albeit complex form of power, which has as its target population, as its principal form of knowledge political economy, and as its essential technical means apparatuses of security.&lt;br /&gt;

2. The tendency which, over a long period and throughout the West, has steadily led towards the pre-eminence over all other forms (sovereignty, discipline, etc) of this type of power which may be termed government, resulting, on the one hand, in formation of a whole series of specific governmental apparatuses, and, on the other, in the development of a whole complex of savoirs.&lt;br /&gt;

3. The process, or rather the result of the process, through which the state of justice of the Middle Ages, transformed into the administrative state during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, gradually becomes 'governmentalized'."&lt;ref name="BGM102-103"&gt;Burchell, Gordon and Miller, 1991: 102-103&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Foucault's explicit definition is rather broad, perhaps further examination of this definition would be useful.

We shall begin with a closer inspection of the first part of Foucault's definition of governmentality:

This strand of the three-part definition states that governmentality is, in other words, all of the components that make up a government that has as its end the maintenance of a well-ordered and happy society (population). The government's means to this end is its "apparatuses of security," that is to say, the techniques it uses to provide this society a feeling of economic, political, and cultural well-being. The government achieves these ends by enacting "political economy," and in this case, the meaning of economy is the older definition of the term, that is to say, "economy at the level of the entire state, which means exercising towards its inhabitants, and the wealth and behavior of each and all, a form of surveillance and control as attentive as that of the head of a family over his household and his goods".&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 92&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, we see that this first part of the definition states that governmentality is a government with specific ends, means to these ends, and particular practices that should lead to these ends.

The second part of Foucault's definition (the "resulting, on the one hand, in formation of a whole series of specific governmental apparatuses, and, on the other, in the development of a whole complex of savoirs"&lt;ref name="BGM102-103"/&gt;) presents governmentality as the long, slow development of Western governments which eventually took over from forms of governance like sovereignty and discipline into what it is today: bureaucracies and the typical methods by which they operate.

The next and last part of Foucault's definition of governmentality can be restated as the evolution from the Medieval state, which maintained its territory and an ordered society within this territory through a blunt practice of simply imposing its laws upon its subjects, to the early [[Renaissance]] state, which became more concerned with the "disposing of things",&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 95&lt;/ref&gt; and so began to employ strategies and tactics to maintain a content and thus stable society, or in other words to "render a society governable".&lt;ref&gt;Jones 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, if one takes these three definitions together, governmentality may be defined as the process through which a form of government with specific ends (a happy and stable society), means to these ends ("apparatuses of security"&lt;ref name=B102&gt;Burchell, 102&lt;/ref&gt;), and with a particular type of knowledge ("political economy"&lt;ref name=B102/&gt;), to achieve these ends, evolved from a medieval state of justice to a modern administrative state with complex bureaucracies.

==History of the term==
The concept of governmentality segues from Foucault's [[ethical]], [[political]] and [[historical]] thoughts from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. His most widely known formulation of this notion is his lecture entitled "Security, territory and population" (1978). A deeper and richer reflection on the notion of governmentality is provided in Foucault's course on "The Birth of Biopolitics" at the [[Collège de France]] in 1978-1979. The course was first published in French in 2004 as ''Naissance de la biopolitique: Cours au Collège de France (1978-1979)'' (Paris: Gallimard &amp; Seuil). This notion is also part of a wider analysis on the topic of disciplinary institutions, on [[neoliberalism]] and the "Rule of Law", the "microphysics of power" and also on what Foucault called [[biopower|biopolitics]]. In the second and third volumes of ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', namely, ''The Use of Pleasure'' (1984) and ''The Care of the Self'' (1984), and in his lecture on "Technologies of the Self" (1982), Foucault elaborated a distinction between [[subjectivation]] and forms of subjectification by exploring how selves were fashioned and then lived in ways which were both heteronomously and autonomously determined. Also, in a series of lectures and articles, including "The Birth of Biopolitics" (1979), "''Omnes et Singulatim'': Towards a Criticism of Political Reason" (1979), "The Subject and Power" (1982) and "What is Enlightenment?" (1984), he posed questions about the nature of contemporary [[social order]]s, the conceptualization of power, human freedom and the limits, possibilities and sources of human actions, etc. that were linked to his understanding of the notion of "governmentality".

The notion of governmentality (not to confuse with [[governance]]) gained attention in the English-speaking academic world mainly through the edited book ''The Foucault Effect'' (1991), which contained a series of essays on the notion of governmentality, together with a translation of Foucault's 1978 short text on ''"gouvernementalité"''.

==Further developments of the concept==
Hunt and Wickham, in their work ''Foucault and Law'' [1994] begin the section on governmentality with a very basic definition derived from Foucault's work. They state, "governmentality is the dramatic expansion in the scope of government, featuring an increase in the number and size of the governmental calculation mechanisms" [1994:76]. In other words, governmentality describes the new form of governing that arose in the mid-eighteenth century that was closely allied with the creation and growth of the modern bureaucracies. In giving this definition, Hunt and Wickham conceive of the term as consisting of two parts 'governmental' and '–ity' - governmental meaning pertaining to the government of a country; and the suffix –ity meaning the study of. They acknowledge that this definition lacks some of Foucault's finer nuances and try to redress this by explaining some more of Foucault's ideas, including reason of state, the problem of population, modern political economy, liberal securitisation, and the emergence of the human sciences" [1994:77].

Kerr's approach to the term is more complex. He conceives of the term as an abbreviation of "governmental rationality" [1999:174]. In other words, it is a way of thinking about the government and the practices of the government. To him it is not "a zone of critical-revolutionary study, but one that conceptually reproduces capitalist rule" [1999:197] by asserting that some form of government (and power) will always be necessary to control and constitute society. By defining governmentality only in terms of the state, Kerr fails to take account of other forms of governance and the idea of mentalities of government in this broader sense.

Dean's understanding of the term incorporates both other forms of governance and the idea of mentalities of government, as well as Hunt and Wickham's, and Kerr's approaches to the term. In line with Hunt and Wickham's approach, Dean acknowledges that in a very narrow sense, governmentality can be used to describe the emergence of a government that saw that the object of governing power was to optimise, use and foster living individuals as members of a population [1999:19]. He also includes the idea of government rationalities, seeing governmentality as one way of looking at the practices of government. In addition to the above, he sees government as anything to do with conducting oneself or others. This is evident in his description of the word in his glossary: "Governmentality: How we think about governing others and ourselves in a wide variety of contexts..." [1999:212]. This reflects that the term government to Foucault meant not so much the political or administrative structures of the modern state as the way in which the conduct of individuals or of groups may be directed. To analyse government is to analyse those mechanisms that try to shape, sculpt, mobilise and work through the choices, desires, aspirations, needs, wants and lifestyles of individuals and groups [Dean, 1999:12].

Dean's main contribution to the definition of the term, however, comes from the way he breaks the term up into 'govern' 'mentality', or mentalities of governing—mentality being a mental disposition or outlook. This means that the concept of governmentality is not just a tool for thinking about government and governing but also incorporates how and what people who are governed think about the way they are governed. He defines thinking as a "collective activity" [1999:16], that is, the sum of the knowledge, beliefs and opinions held by those who are governed. He also raises the point that a mentality is not usually "examined by those who inhabit it" [1999:16]. This raises the interesting point that those who are governed may not understand the unnaturalness of both the way they live and the fact that they take this way of life for granted—that the same activity in which they engage in "can be regarded as a different form of practice depending on the mentalities that invest it" [1999:17]. Dean highlights another important feature of the concept of governmentality—its reflexivity. He explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''On the one hand, we govern others and ourselves according to what we take to be true about who we are, what aspects of our existence should be worked upon, how, with what means, and to what ends. On the other hand, the ways in which we govern and conduct ourselves give rise to different ways of producing truth. [1999:18]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By drawing attention to the 'how and why', Dean connects "technologies of power" [Lemke, 2001:191] to the concept of governmentality. According to Dean any definition of governmentality should incorporate all of Foucault's intended ideas. A complete definition of the term governmentality must include not only government in terms of the state, but government in terms of any "conduct of conduct" [Dean, 1999:10]. It must incorporate the idea of mentalities and the associations that go with that concept: that it is an attitude towards something, and that it is not usually understood "from within its own perspective" [1999:16], and that these mentalities are collective and part of a society's culture. It must also include an understanding of the ways in which conduct is governed, not just by governments, but also by ourselves and others.

The semantic linking of governing and mentalities in governmentality indicates that it is not possible to study technologies of power without an analysis of the mentality of rule underpinning them. The practice of going to the gym, expounded below, is a useful example because it shows how our choices, desires, aspirations, needs, wants and lifestyles have been mobilised and shaped by various technologies of power.

===Mentality of rule===
A mentality of rule is any relatively systematic way of thinking about government. It delineates a discursive field in which the exercise of power is 'rationalised' [Lemke, 2001:191]. Thus Neo-liberalism is a mentality of rule because it represents a method of rationalising the exercise of government, a rationalisation that obeys the internal rule of maximum economy [Foucault, 1997:74]. [[Francis Fukuyama|Fukuyama]] [in Rose, 1999: 63] writes "a liberal State is ultimately a limited State, with governmental activity strictly bounded by the sphere of individual liberty". However, only a certain type of liberty, a certain way of understanding and exercising freedom is compatible with Neo-liberalism. If Neo-liberalist government is to fully realize its goals, individuals must come to recognize and act upon themselves as both free and responsible [Rose, 1999:68]. Thus Neo-liberalism must work to create the social reality that it proposes already exists. For as Lemke states, a mentality of government "is not pure, neutral knowledge that simply re-presents the governing reality" [Lemke, 2001:191] instead, Neo-liberalism constitutes an attempt to link a reduction in state welfare services and security systems to the increasing call for subjects to become free, enterprising, autonomous individuals. It can then begin to govern its subjects, not through intrusive state bureaucracies backed with legal powers, the imposition of moral standards under a religious mandate, but through structuring the possible field of action in which they govern themselves, to govern them through their freedom. Through the transformation of subjects with duties and obligations, into individuals, with rights and freedoms, modern individuals are not merely 'free to choose' but obliged to be free, "to understand and enact their lives in terms of choice" [Rose, 1999:87]. This freedom is a different freedom to that offered in the past. It is a freedom to realize our potential and our dreams through reshaping the way in which we conduct our lives.

=== From governmentality to neoliberal governmentality: cartography ===

==== Governmentality and cartography ====
Cartographic [[Cartography|mapping]] has historically been a key strategy of governmentality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose-Redwood|first=R.B.|title=Governmentality, Geography, and the Geo-Coded World|journal=Progress in Human Geography.|year=2006|volume=30|issue=4|pages=469–486|doi=10.1191/0309132506ph619oa}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Brian Harley|Harley]],&lt;ref name ="Harley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harley|first=J.B.|title=Deconstructing the Map|journal=Cartographica |year=1989|volume=26|issue=2|pages=1–20|doi=10.3138/e635-7827-1757-9t53}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], affirms that [[Sovereign state|State]]-produced maps "extend and reinforce the legal statutes, territorial imperatives, and values stemming from the exercise of political power". Typically, State-led mapping conforms to [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]]'s concept of a [[panopticon]], in which 'the one views the many'. From a Foucauldian vantage point, this was the blueprint for disciplinary power.&lt;ref name="Hannah 2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hannah|first=M.G|title=Governmentality and the Mastery of Territory in Nineteenth-Century America|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neoliberal governmentality and cartography ====
Through processes of [[neoliberalism]], the State has "hollowed out" some of its cartographic responsibilities and delegated power to individuals who are at a lower geographical [[scale (map)|scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jessop|first=B|title=A Handbook of Comparative Social Policy|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham|pages=11–27|editor=Kennett, P|chapter=Hollowing Out the 'Nation-State' and Multi-Level Governance}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'People's cartography' is believed to deliver a more democratic spatial [[governance]] than traditional [[wikt:top-down|top-down]] State-distribution of cartographic knowledge.&lt;ref name ="Crampton"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crampton|first=J|title=Mapping Without a Net|journal=Paper Presented as Part of Virtual Seminar in GIScience and Technology|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus subverting Harley's&lt;ref name=Harley /&gt; theory that mapping is uniquely a source of power for the powerful.

===Self-governing capabilities===
Through our freedom, particular self-governing capabilities can be installed in order to bring our own ways of conducting and evaluating ourselves into alignment with political objectives [Rose, 1996:155]. These capabilities are enterprise and [[autonomy]]. Enterprise here designates an array of rules for the conduct of one's everyday existence: energy, initiative, ambition, calculation, and personal responsibility. The enterprising self will make an enterprise of its life, seek to maximize its own human capital, project itself a future, and seek to shape life in order to become what it wishes to be. The enterprising self is thus both an active self and a calculating self, a self that calculates about itself and that acts upon itself in order to better itself [Rose, 1996:154]. Autonomy is about taking control of our undertakings, defining our goals, and planning to achieve our needs through our own powers [Rose, 1996:159]. The autonomy of the self is thus not the eternal antithesis of [[political power]], but one of the objectives and instruments of modern mentalities for the conduct of conduct [Rose, 1996:155].

These three qualities: freedom, enterprise and autonomy are embodied in the practice of going to the gym. It is our choice to go the gym, our choice which gym to go to. By going to the gym we are working on ourselves, on our body shape and our physical fitness. We are giving ourselves qualities to help us perform better than others in life, whether to attract a better mate than others, or to be able to work more efficiently, more effectively and for longer without running out of steam to give us an advantage over our competitors. When we go to the gym, we go through our own discipline, on our own timetable, to reach our own goals. We design and act out our routine by ourselves. We do not need the ideas or support of a team, it is our self that makes it possible. The practice of going to the gym, of being free, enterprising, autonomous, is imbued with particular technologies of power.

===Technologies of power===
Technologies of power are those "technologies imbued with aspirations for the shaping of conduct in the hope of producing certain desired effects and averting certain undesired ones" [Rose, 1999:52]. The two main groups of technologies of power are technologies of the self, and technologies of the market. Foucault defined technologies of the self as techniques that allow individuals to effect by their own means a certain number of operations on their own bodies, minds, souls, and lifestyle, so as to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state of happiness, and quality of life. Technologies of the market are those technologies based around the buying and selling of goods that enable us to define who we are, or want to be. These two technologies are not always completely distinct, as both borrow bits of each other from time to time.

====Technologies of the self====
[[Technologies of the self]] refer to the practices and strategies by which individuals represent to themselves their own ethical self-understanding. One of the main features of technologies of self is that of expertise. Expertise has three important aspects. First, its grounding of authority in a claim to scientificity and objectivity creates distance between self-regulation and the state that is necessary with liberal democracies. Second, expertise can "mobilise and be mobilised within political argument in distinctive ways, producing a new relationship between knowledge and government. Expertise comes to be accorded a particular role in the formulation of programs of government and in the technologies that seek to give them effect" [Rose, 1996:156]. Third, expertise operates through a relationship with the self-regulating abilities of individuals. The plausibility inherent in a claim to scientificity binds "subjectivity to truth and subjects to experts" [Rose, 1996:156]. Expertise works through a logic of choice, through a transformation of the ways in which individuals constitute themselves, through "inculcating desires for self-development that expertise itself can guide and through claims to be able to allay the anxieties generated when the actuality of life fails to live up to its image [Rose, 1999:88].

The technologies of the self involved in the practice of, for example, going to the gym are the: technology of responsibilisation, technology of healthism, technology of normalisation and technology of self-esteem.

====Responsibilisation====
In line with its desire to reduce the scope of government (e.g. welfare) Neo-liberalism characteristically develops indirect techniques for leading and controlling individuals without being responsible for them. The main mechanism is through the technology of responsibilisation. This entails subjects becoming responsibilised by making them see social risks such as illness, unemployment, poverty, etc. not as the responsibility of the state, but actually lying in the domain for which the individual is responsible and transforming it into a problem of 'self-care' [Lemke, 2001:201] and of 'consumption'.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/677842 |title=Creating the Responsible Consumer: Moralistic Governance Regimes and Consumer Subjectivity |year=2014 |last1=Giesler |first1=Markus|last2=Veresiu |first2=Ela |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=41 |issue=October |pages=849–867}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of going to the gym can be seen as a result of responsibilisation, our responsibility to remain free of illness so as to be able to work and to care for our dependants (children, elderly parents etc.) This technology somewhat overlaps with the technology of healthism.

====Healthism====
[[Healthism]] links the "public objectives for the good health and good order of the social body with the desire of individuals for health and well-being" [Rose, 1999:74]. Healthy bodies and hygienic homes may still be objectives of the state, but it no longer seeks to discipline, instruct, moralise or threaten us into compliance. Rather "individuals are addressed on the assumption that they want to be healthy and enjoined to freely seek out the ways of living most likely to promote their own health" [Rose, 1999:86-87] such as going to the gym. However while the technology of responsibilisation may be argued to be a calculated technique of the state, the wave of Healthism is less likely to be a consequence of state planning, but arising out of the newer social sciences such as nutrition and human movement. Healthism assigns, as do most technologies of the self, a key role to experts. For it is experts who can tell us how to conduct ourselves in terms of safe, precise techniques to improve cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, and overall health. The borrowing from technologies of the market by technologies of the self can be clearly seen in the area of healthism. The idea of health, the goal of being healthy, the joys brought by good health and the ways of achieving it are advertised to us in the same manner as goods and services are marketed by sales people. By adhering to the principles of healthism, our personal goals are aligned with political goals and we are thus rendered governable.

====Normalisation====
Another technology of power arising from the social sciences is that of [[Normalization (sociology)|normalisation]]. The technology of norms was given a push by the new methods of measuring population. A norm is that "which is socially worthy, statistically average, scientifically healthy and personally desirable".&lt;ref&gt;Rose, 1999:76&lt;/ref&gt; The important aspect of normality, is that while the norm is natural, those who wish to achieve normality will do so by working on themselves, controlling their impulses in everyday conduct and habits, and inculcating norms of conduct into their children, under the guidance of others. Norms are enforced through the calculated administration of [[shame]]. Shame entails an anxiety over the exterior behaviour and appearance of the self, linked to an injunction to care for oneself in the name of achieving quality of life [Rose, 1999:73]. Norms are usually aligned with political goals, thus the norm would be fit, virile, energetic individuals, able to work, earn money, and spend it and thus sustain the economy. For instance, the practice of going to the gym allows one to achieve this 'normality'. Through shame we are governed into conforming with the goals of Neo-liberalism.

====Self-esteem====
[[Self-esteem]] is a practical and productive technology linked to the technology of norms, which produces of certain kinds of selves. Self-esteem is a technology in the sense that it is a specialised knowledge of how to esteem ourselves to estimate, calculate, measure, evaluate, discipline, and to judge our selves.&lt;ref&gt;Cruikshank, 1996:273&lt;/ref&gt; The 'self-esteem' approach considers a wide variety of social problems to have their source in a lack of self-esteem on the part of the persons concerned. 'Self-esteem' thus has much more to do with self-assessment than with self-respect, as the self continuously has to be measured, judged and disciplined in order to gear personal 'empowerment' to collective yardsticks.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, 2001:202&lt;/ref&gt; These collective yardsticks are determined by the norms previously discussed. Self-esteem is a technology of self for "evaluating and acting upon ourselves so that the police, the guards and the doctors do not have to do so".&lt;ref&gt;Cruikshank, 1996:234&lt;/ref&gt; By taking up the goal of self-esteem, we allow ourselves to be governable from a distance. The technology of self-esteem and other similar psychological technologies also borrow from technologies of the market, namely [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. A huge variety of self-help books, tapes, videos and other paraphernalia are available for purchase by the individual.

====Technologies of the market====
The technologies of the market that underlie the practice of going to the gym can be described as the technology of desire, and the technology of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] through consumption. The technology of desire is a mechanism that induces in us desires that we work to satisfy. Marketers create wants and artificial needs in us through advertising goods, experiences and lifestyles that are tempting to us. These advertisements seek to convey the sense of individual satisfaction brought about by the purchase or use of this product.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:86&lt;/ref&gt; We come to desire these things and thus act in a manner that allows us to achieve these things, whether by working harder and earning more money or by employing technologies of the self to shape our lifestyle to the manner we desire . The borrowing of technologies of the self by technologies of the market extends even further in this case. Marketers use the knowledge created by psyche- discourses, especially psychological characteristics as the basis of their market segmentation. This allows them to appeal more effectively to each individual. Thus we are governed into purchasing commodities through our desire.

The technology of identity through consumption utilises the power of goods to shape identities.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:76&lt;/ref&gt; Each commodity is imbued with a particular meaning, which is reflected upon those who purchase it, illuminating the kind of person they are, or want to be. Consumption is portrayed as placing an individual within a certain form of life. The technology of identity through consumption can be seen in the choices that face the gym attendee. To go to an expensive gym because it demonstrates wealth/success or to go to a moderately priced gym so as to appear economical. The range of gym wear is extensive. Brand name to portray the abilities portrayed in its advertising, expensive to portray commitment, or cheap to portray your unconcern for other people's opinions. All of these choices of consumption are used to communicate our identity to others, and thus we are governed by marketers into choosing those products that identify with our identity.

These technologies of the market and of the self are the particular mechanisms whereby individuals are induced into becoming free, enterprising individuals who govern themselves and thus need only limited direct governance by the state. The implementation of these technologies is greatly assisted by experts from the social sciences. These experts operate a regime of the self, where success in life depends on our continual exercise of freedom, and where our life is understood, not in terms of fate or social status, but in terms of our success or failure in acquiring the skills and making the choices to actualise ourself.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:87&lt;/ref&gt; If we engage in the practice of going to the gym, we are undertaking an exercise in self-government. We do so by drawing upon certain forms of knowledge and expertise provided by gym instructors, health professionals, of the purveyors of the latest fitness fad. Depending on why we go to the gym, we may calculate number of calories burned, heart-rate, or muscle size. In all cases, we attend the gym for a specific set of reasons underpinned by the various technologies of the self and the market. The part of ourselves we seek to work upon, the means by which we do so, and who we hope to become, all vary according to the nature of the technology of power by which we are motivated [Dean, 1999:17]. All of these various reasons and technologies are underpinned by the mentality of government that seeks to transform us into a free, enterprising, autonomous individual: Neo-liberalism.  Furthermore, Neo-liberalism seeks to create and disseminate definitions of freedom, autonomy and what it means to be enterprising that re-create forms of behavior amenable to neo-liberal goals.

===Ecogovernmentality===
[[Ecogovernmentality]] (or eco-governmentality) is the application of Foucault's concepts of biopower and governmentality to the analysis of the regulation of social interactions with the natural world. Timothy W. Luke theorized this as environmentality and green governmentality. Ecogovernmentality began in the mid-1990s with a small body of theorists (Luke, Darier, and Rutherford) the literature on ecogovernmentality grew as a response to the perceived lack of Foucauldian analysis of environmentalism and in environmental studies.

Following Michel Foucault, writing on ecogovernmentality focuses on how [[Government agency|government agencies]], in combination with producers of expert knowledge, construct "The Environment." This construction is viewed both in terms of the creation of an object of knowledge and a sphere within which certain types of intervention and management are created and deployed to further the government's larger aim of managing the lives of its constituents. This governmental management is dependent on the dissemination and internalization of knowledge/power among individual actors. This creates a decentered network of self-regulating elements whose interests become integrated with those of the State.

===Crises of Governmentality===
According to Foucault, there are several instances where the Western, "liberal art of government" enters into a period of crisis, where the logic of ensuring freedom (which was defined against the background of [[risk society|risk]] or danger) necessitates actions "which potentially risk producing exactly the opposite."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. ''The Birth of Biopolitics: Lectures at the College de France (1978-9).'' Trans. Graham Burchell. Ed. Michael Senellart. 1st Picador Paperback Edition. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2010, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inherently contradictory logics that lead to such contradictions are identified by Foucault as:

1. Liberalism depends on the socialization of individuals to fear the constant presence of danger, e.g., public campaigns advocating savings banks, public hygiene, and disease prevention, the development of detective novels as a genre and of news stories of crime, and sexual anxieties surrounding "degeneration."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, 2008, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Liberal freedom requires disciplinary techniques that manage the individual's behaviour and everyday life so as to ensure productivity and the increase in profit through efficient labour, e.g., Bentham's [[Panopticon]] surveillance system. Liberalism claims to supervise the natural mechanisms of behaviour and production, but must intervene when it notices "irregularities."&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"&gt;Foucault, 2008, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

3. Liberalism must force individuals to be free: control and intervention becomes the entire basis of freedom. Freedom must ultimately be manufactured by control rather than simply "counterweighted" by it.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"/&gt;

Examples of this contradictory logic which Foucault cites are the policies of the [[Keynesian]] [[welfare state]] under [[F.D. Roosevelt]], the thought of the German liberals in the [[Freiburg school]], and the thought of American [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] economists such as the [[Chicago School of Economics|Chicago School]] which attempt to free individuals from the lack of freedom perceived to exist under socialism and fascism, but did so by using state interventionist models.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"/&gt;

These governmental crises may be triggered by phenomena such as a discursive concern with increasing economic capital costs for the exercise of freedom, e.g., prices for purchasing resources, the need for excessive state coercion and interventionism to protect market freedoms, e.g., anti-trust and anti-monopoly legislation that leads to a "legal strait-jacket" for the state,&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 68"&gt;Foucault, 2008, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; local protests rejecting the disciplinary mechanisms of the market society and state.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 68"/&gt; and finally, the destructive and wasteful effects of ineffective mechanisms for producing freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, 2008, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research by [https://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelFischer Fischer] and colleagues at the [[University of Oxford]] has renewed interest in Foucault's exploration of potential resistance to governmentality, and its application to health care, drawing on Foucault's recently published final lectures at the College de France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael Daniel|author2=Ferlie, Ewan|title=Resisting hybridisation between modes of clinical risk management: Contradiction, contest, and the production of intractable conflict|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|date=1 January 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=30–49|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=The courage of truth (the government of self and others II) : lectures at the Collège de France, 1983-1984|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK|isbn=9781403986689 |author2=Ewald, François |author3=Burchell, Alessandro Fontana |editor=Arnold I.

===Beyond the West===
Jeffreys and Sigley (2009)  highlight that governmentality studies have focused on advanced liberal democracies, and preclude considerations of non-liberal forms of governmentality in both western and non-western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[ Jeffreys, E. &amp; Sigley, G. 2009, 'Governmentality, governance and China' in Elaine Jeffreys (eds), China's Governmentalities: governing change, changing government, Routledge, New York, USA, pp. 1-23]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have broken new ground by applying Foucault's concept of governmentality to non-western and non-liberal settings, such as China. Jeffreys (2009) for example provides a collection of essay on China's approach to governance, development, education, the environment, community, religion, and sexual health where the notion of 'Chinese governmentally' is based not on the notion of 'freedom and liberty' as in the western tradition but rather, on a distinct rational approach to planning and administration.&lt;ref&gt;[ Jeffreys, E. 2009, China's Governmentalities: governing change, changing government, Routledge, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-415-54744-4}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Such new studies thus use Foucault's Governmentalities to outline the nature of shifts in governance and contribute to emerging studies of governmentality in non-western contexts.

A '''green building''' is one which uses less water, optimises energy efficiency, conserves natural resources, generates less waste and provides healthier spaces for occupants, as compared to a conventional building. IGBC is leading green building movement in the country.

==Indian Green Building Council (IGBC)==

The Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) was formed by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in 2001. The council is based out of the CII Green Business Centre, Hyderabad which is India’s 1st Platinum rated green building. The vision of the council is to enable ‘Sustainable built environment for all. 

IGBC is the country's premier body for green building certification and allied services. Today, with strong support from various stakeholders, we have achieved the following significant milestones:
* 4,400+ projects registered with IGBC from various parts of India and abroad, amounting to a total footprint of 4.72 billion sq. ft.
* 22 IGBC green building ratings to cover all typologies of projects -  residential, commercial, industrial, healthcare, etc
* 2,100+ IGBC Member Organizations comprising developers, corporates, architects, consultants, institutes, government, etc
* 2,800+ qualified IGBC Accredited Green Building Professionals ; more than 30,000 stakeholders have been trained by IGBC till date

IGBC certifies the green projects which are conceptualized, designed, constructed and operated as per [https://igbc.in/igbc/redirectHtml.htm?redVal=showratingSysnosign IGBC Ratings]. Till date, more than 1,250 projects (approx 400 million sq ft) have been rated by IGBC. These IGBC-rated projects, as compared to conventional structures, have demonstrated tremendous savings to the extent of up to:
* 15,000 MWh of Energy per million sq ft. per annum 
* 45,000 KL of Water per million sq ft. per annum 
* Installation of 30 MW of Renewable Energy in IGBC certified projects 
* Reduced CO2 emissions by 12,000 tons per million sq ft. per annum 
* Diverted 500 Tons of construction waste from landfill per million sq ft. 
 
Green projects rated by IGBC fall under one of the following levels (in ascending order): Certified, Silver, Gold and Platinum. For further details, please refer the IGBC website, [https://igbc.in/igbc/ www.igbc.in]

==IGBC Green league (IGL) by IGBC Mumbai Chapter==
The foremost objective of IGL is "Learning &amp; Growing : Together". The particular initiative has taken by IGBC Mumbai Chapter.

Residential buildings in India:
The residential building sector is one of the largest consumers of electricity in India. Continuous urbanisation and the growth of population result in increasing power consumption in buildings. Thus, while experts express the huge potential for energy conservations in this sector, the belief still predominates among stakeholders that energy-efficient buildings are more expensive than conventional buildings, which adversely affects the “greening” of the building sector. This belief is contested by studies finding evidence for the opposite being the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adelphi.de/en/publications/dok/43509.php?pid=1971|title=Energy-efficient buildings – a business case for India?

== EDGE Program in India ==
The [[International Finance Corporation|IFC]], a member of the [[World Bank Group]], and the [[CREDAI|Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Associations of India (CREDAI)]], apex body of private real estate developers, have partnered to promote green buildings in the country through IFC’s [https://www.edgebuildings.com EDGE certification]. An MoU was signed in the presence of Minister for Environment and Forests [[Prakash Javadekar]] on&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/ifc-to-help-credai-members-develop-green-buildings-114112501158_1.html|title=MoU was signed in the presence of Minister for Environment and Forests|author= |date= |work= |publisher=Business Standard|accessdate=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; November 25, 2014.

== BEE certification ==
The Indian [[Bureau of Energy Efficiency]] (BEE) launched the Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC). The code is set for energy efficiency standards for design and construction with any building of minimum conditioned area of 1,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a connected demand of power of 500 KW or 600 KVA.  The energy performance index of the code is set from 90&amp;nbsp;kW·h/sqm/year to 200&amp;nbsp;kW·h/sqm/year where any buildings that fall under the index can be termed as '''"ECBC Compliant Building"'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnre.gov.in/akshayurja/akshayurja-april-2011/BEE%20Star%20rating%20for%20buildings.pdf|title=BEE Star rating for buildings|author=|date=|work=|publisher=Ministry of New &amp; Renewable Energy, Indian Government|accessdate=20 January 2012}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the BEE launched a five-star rating scheme for office buildings operated only in the day time in three climatic zones, composite, hot&amp;dry, warm&amp;humid on 25 February 2009. IGBC rated green buildings are also able to meet or exceed the ECBC compliance. The CII Sohrabji Godrej Green Business Centre is a BEE 5 star-rated building.

The Reserve Bank of India's buildings in [[Delhi]], Bhubaneshwar in [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] and in Kerala have been star rated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=RBI building gets four-star rating|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/02/26/stories/2009022660760300.htm|accessdate=|newspaper=The Hindu|date=26 February 2009|location=NewDelhi, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tamil Nadu 11 buildings were star rated by BEE, in the year 2010, including RBI buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=11 buildings in Tamilnadu get energy-efficient rating from central agency|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-07-23/chennai/28307202_1_energy-efficiency-energy-performance-index-office-buildings|accessdate=|newspaper=Times of India|date=23 July 2010|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Green houses==
In Tamil Nadu, the government is planning to build solar-powered green houses for rural poor. It has allotted Rs.1058
crore for construction of 60,000 houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Construction of solar-powered green houses for the poor to begin soon|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/article2625763.ece|accessdate=|newspaper=The Hindu|date=14 November 2011|location=Madurai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Maharashtra, near Mumbai in the Thane District, Govardhan Eco Village, a community in India, has built buildings with compressed stabilized Earth blocks, Rammed Earth Technique, Cob Houses(ADOBE Bricks) with traditional thatched roofs. These buildings have received a five-star rating from GRIHA, an Indian Nationwide Green Standards for Buildings, a wing of the famous TERI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GRIHA 5 STAR RATING FOR GOVARDHAN ECO VILLAGE |url=http://ecovillage.org.in/house-of-the-century-gev-scores-a-100-at-the-5th-griha-summit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional buildings==
Traditional buildings were energy efficient because architecture depended on the places. Buildings in the hot and dry regions, had corridors directing the wind to cool naturally. In wet regions, structures using natural light and breeze, were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Redoing green buildings|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/sunita-narain-redoing-green-buildings/389705/|accessdate=|newspaper=Business Standard|date=26 March 2010|location=New Delhi, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples are

This is a '''history of [[drug prohibition in the United States]]'''.

{{TOC right}}

Efforts to regulate the sale of [[pharmaceuticals]] began around 1860, and laws were introduced on a state-to-state basis that created penalties for mislabeling drugs, [[adulterant|adulterating]] them with undisclosed [[narcotics]], and improper sale of those considered "[[poison]]s". Poison laws generally either required labels on the packaging indicating the harmful effects of the drugs or prohibited sale outside of licensed pharmacies and without a doctor's prescription. Prominent pharmaceutical societies at the time supported the listing of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] as a poison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Chemist &amp; druggist|volume=28|publisher=Benn Brothers|year=1886|location=London, New York City, Melbourne|pages=68,330|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qiPOAAAAMAAJ|title=Chemist &amp; druggist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, the U.S. and [[Qing Dynasty]] [[China]] complete an agreement prohibiting the shipment of [[opium]] between the two countries; Qing China itself was still reeling from the effects of fighting the [[Opium War]] after a failed attempt to stem the British importing of opium into [[China proper]] (see [[Lin Zexu]]).

The rate of opiate addiction increased from about .72 addicts per 1,000 people to a high of 4.59 per 1,000 in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Sarah | last=Crawford | title=History repeats itself with opioid epidemic | url=https://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/2018/01/26/opioid-epidemic-19th-century-addiction-morphine-bayer-heroin/1018327001/| newspaper=Florida Today | location=Melbourne, Florida| pages= 10A | date=February 2, 2018 | accessdate=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---soft and hard copy sources mismatch, but are identical articles---&gt;

In 1906 the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] requires that certain specified drugs, including [[alcohol]], [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], [[morphine]], and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], be accurately labeled with contents and dosage. Previously many drugs had been sold as [[patent medicines]] with secret ingredients or misleading labels. Cocaine, heroin, cannabis, and other such drugs continued to be legally available without prescription as long as they were labeled. It is estimated that sale of patent medicines containing [[opiates]] decreased by 33% after labeling was mandated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

1914: The first recorded instance of the United States enacting a ban on the domestic distribution of drugs is the [[Harrison Act|Harrison Narcotic Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/SCHAFFER/history/e1910/harrisonact.htm|title=Harrison Narcotics Tax Act, 1914 - Full Text|publisher=|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 1914.

1919: [[Prohibition in the United States|Alcohol prohibition]] in the U.S. first appeared under numerous provincial bans and was eventually codified under a federal [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|constitutional amendment]] in 1919, having been approved by 36 of the 48 U.S. states.

1925: [[United States]] supported regulation of cannabis as a drug in the [[International Opium Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/e1920/willoughby.htm|title=The Geneva Conferences: Indian Hemp|publisher=|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and by the mid-1930s all member states had some regulation of cannabis.

1930: The [[Federal Bureau of Narcotics]] was created. For the next 32 years it was headed by [[Harry J. Anslinger]] who came from the [[Bureau of Prohibition]] as did many of its initial members.

1932: Democrat Franklin Roosevelt ran for President of the United States promising repeal of federal laws of Prohibition of alcohol.

1933: [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] is repealed. The amendment remains the only major act of prohibition to be repealed, having been repealed by the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

1935: President Roosevelt hails the [[International Opium Convention]] and application of it in US. law and other anti-drug laws in a radio message to the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.net/schaffer/History/e1930/rooseveltasks.htm|title=Roosevelt Asks Narcotic War Aid - New York Times March 22, 1935|publisher=|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1937: Congress passed the [[1937 Marijuana Tax Act|Marijuana Tax Act]]. Presented as a $1 nuisance tax on the distribution of marijuana, this act required anyone distributing the drug to maintain and submit a [http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/taxact/mjtaxact.htm detailed account] of his or her transactions, including inspections, affidavits, and private information regarding the parties involved. This law, however, was something of a "[[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]]", as obtaining a tax stamp required individuals to first present their goods, which was an action tantamount to confession. This act was passed by Congress on the basis of testimony and public perception that marijuana caused [http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/History/whiteb1.htm insanity, criminality, and death].

1951: The 1951 [[Boggs Act]] increased penalties fourfold, including mandatory penalties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naabt.org/laws.cfm History of drug legislation], The National Alliance of Advocates for Buprenorphine Treatment&lt;/ref&gt;

1956: The Daniel Act increased penalties by a factor of eight over those specified in the Boggs Act. Although by this time there was adequate testimony to refute the claim that marijuana caused insanity, criminality, or death, the rationalizations for these laws shifted in focus to the proposition that marijuana use led to the use of heroin, creating the [[Gateway drug|gateway drug theory]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In 1970, the [[Controlled Substances Act]] (CSA) was enacted into law by Congress. The CSA is the federal U.S. drug policy under which the manufacture, importation, possession, use and distribution of certain substances is regulated. This legislation is the foundation on which the modern drug war exists. Responsibility for enforcement of this new law was given to the [[Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs]] and then, in 1973, to the newly formed [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]. During the Nixon era, for the only time in the history of the war on drugs, the majority of funding goes towards treatment, rather than law enforcement.&lt;ref name=frontline/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8956">{{main|Inquisitorial system}}
The principle of inquisition is a form of criminal proceeding developed in Italy, which is labeled by the axiom of the ex officio inquiry of a criminal issue. There is no obligation of the inquiry and the final decision to be executed by the same institution.

== History ==
The procedure of inquisition was already known in Roman law.  In the time of the ancient Roman kings inquisition was the standard method of criminal inquiry. There were no rules. The disposal of the [[magistrate]], who acted on pure [[denunciation]], was the criteria which guided the proceedings. Because of these problems, the principle of inquisition was replaced  by a principle of contradiction.

[[Pope Innocent III]] (1161–1216) reintroduced the procedure of inquisition for [[canon law]], where it became a well-feared instrument against heretics. The concept of inquisition was not limited to canon law. In Italy the use of the inquisition was transferred to secular criminal law. 
 
The first adaption within the territory of the ''[[Holy Roman Empire]] of the German Nation'' were the ''Wormser Reformation'' of 1498 and the ''Constitutio Criminalis Bambergensis'' of 1507. The adoption of the [[Constitutio Criminalis Carolina]] ("peinliche Gerichtsordnung"  of Charles V) in 1532 makes the procedure of inquisition empirical law.  It was the passage of the ''code d´ instruction criminelle'',  the French code of criminal procedure, by Emperor [[Napoleon]] of France on November 16, 1808 and the adoption of its principles in German territories that terminated the classical procedure of inquisition in Germany.

== Theory of the principle of inquisition ==
The basic criteria of the procedure of inquisition is the existence of an institution, which carries out ex officio inquiries into cases, presumably committed by a certain person or organization. An accuser (or an informer) is not necessary. Only the results of the all-embracing examination of facts and proofs shall be the base of a final, logical decision without any influence of the injured or the accused litigant. The defendant is a pure object of the proceedings. He has no right to be heard. His participation to the proceedings is limited to the necessities of the lawsuit.

== Practical translation to the criminal law of the ''Holy Roman Empire'' ==

Completely new to the criminal procedures of the Middle Ages was the attempt to base the decision of the opening and the sentence on facts, inquired by the court.

The law of the Germans only allowed the beginning of a lawsuit on the accusations of the victim. The offender was limited to the positioning of the charge. The only hearing of evidence was the [[Compurgation|confirmation of the good reputation of the defendant by oath]]. Notable members of the community, so called helpers by oath (Eidhelfer) described only the reputation of the defendant, not the facts or the circumstances of the crime. There was no witness to the crime involved. In case of good reputation, the charge failed. Only in the case of bad reputation or of confession was a conviction possible. That is the reason why the typical legal conflict of the early Middle Ages was solved by [[Trial by combat|regulated force of arms]], which public peace and peace of God alone limited, while legal proceedings were almost an exception. The institution of inquisition was an enormous legal improvement, because it included the proof relating to the facts of the crime to the inquiry. The reputation of the defendant no longer was the main topic of the proceedings. It was replaced by an inquiry, made on real facts.

[[Image:Peinliches Verhoer.jpg|right|350px]]
The implementation of the facts practically meant an enormous restriction of the rights of a defendant with good reputation, who now faced a real risk of condemnation. There was a certain discomfort with this risk. Therefore there was still the need for a confession in addition to the results of the inquiry. This confession was to be gained by torture. An innocent was deemed able to withstand the torture with the help of God, and thus would not falsely confess. Contemporaries understand the problem of torture not to be this last proof of findings, long proved by finished inquiries, but an easy way to substitute those inquiries. The criminal law of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] limited the use of torture with the need of approval by the ''procurateur general'', an administrator situated at the ducal court in Nancy. The local court had to ask for the use of torture by presenting the results of its inquiries.

== Problems of the inquisition ==

The greatest problems of the medieval proceeding of inquiry were to be found outside of the principle itself.

* The proceedings occurred in secrecy. The maxim of publicity, that is standard today, did not exist. A proceeding without public control always included the risk of a judge who was not able or willing (because of the influence of others, especially his lord) to give a proper judgment.
* Torture gave proof to everything. A proceeding that is based on any form of torture will never give results that can be trusted. Torture is only an instrument of manipulation.
* There was the danger of denunciation. The Constitutio Carolina did not plan for denunciation. The legal option of a citizen to open legal proceedings was through an accusation. This accuser had to answer for the truth of their accusations. In the case of innocence of the defendant the accuser would be punished.&lt;ref&gt;CONSTITUTIO CAROLINA CRIMINALIS, Art. 12, cited from Sellert Rüping, Studien und Quellenbuch zur Geschichte der deutschen Strafrechtspflege, Bd.1, Von den Anfängen bis zur Aufklärung, S 229: "Jtem so balldt der angeclagt zu gegenngknuss Angenommen ist, soll der Anclager oder sein gwallthaber mit seinem leip verwart werden, biss er mit burgenn, Caution vnd bestanndt vnd sicherung, die der Richter mitsampt Vier Schepfenn nach gelegenheit der sache vnd achtung beder personen fur genugsam erkennt, gethan hat,..."&lt;/ref&gt; The other way to begin the proceedings was by the personal knowledge of the authorities. This degenerated into a system of denunciation. In some regions during witch trials a box of denunciation (a box hanging or standing at a public place), was used to enable everyone to make anonymous accusations by inserting a piece of paper without revealing their names, and thus assuming no risk.
* The only demerit of the principle of inquisition itself was the lack of neutrality of the judge. He had to decide on the results of an inquiry which only he himself had made. Why should he dispute his own work? This problem can be solved with publicity and the possibility of appeal.

== The principle of inquiry in modern proceedings ==

The principle of inquisition is still in use in modern criminal law in Germany, though to a restricted extent. The legal basis is § 244 II Strafprozeßordnung (German code of criminal procedure) that orders the court to examine ex officio every fact and proof that could be relevant to a judgment.&lt;ref&gt;§ 244 II StPO: "In order to establish the truth, the court shall, proprio motu, extend the taking of evidence to all facts and means of proof relevant to the decision."&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these facts or proofs are inserted by the plaintiff or the defendant, but the court has the right to present evidence on its own. The court is even enabled to judge, according to the result of the proceedings,  the violation of laws the plaintiff did not mention and to sentence differently from the proposals of the litigants (theoretically an offense of involuntary manslaughter could be raised into a charge and sentence of premeditated murder, for example). If the proceedings show the violation of other laws by the same act, the court is able to pass sentence on these as well.

== Inquisition as basic principle ==

Alternative principles are the principle of contradiction and the principle of consent.

'''''How to Talk Dirty and Influence People''''' is an [[autobiography]] by [[Lenny Bruce]], an American [[satirist]] and [[comedian]], who died in 1966 at age 40 of a drug overdose.

At the request of [[Hugh Hefner]] and with the aid of [[Paul Krassner]], Bruce wrote the work in serialized format for ''[[Playboy]]'' in 1964 and 1965. Shortly thereafter it was released as a novel by Playboy Publishing.&lt;ref name=watts&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watts|first1=Steven|title=Mr Playboy: Hugh Hefner and the American Dream|date=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470501375|page=190|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m5b_eM3twmEC&amp;pg=PA190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book details the course of his career, which began in the late 1940s. In it, he challenges the sanctity of [[organized religion]] and other societal and political conventions he perceived as having [[hypocrisy|hypocritical]] tendencies, and widened the boundaries of [[free speech]]. The title is a parody of the 1936 bestseller ''[[How to Win Friends and Influence People]]'', by [[Dale Carnegie]].

{{Japanese name|Hozumi}}
Baron {{nihongo|'''Hozumi Nobushige'''|穂積 陳重||extra=23 August 1855 –7 April 1926}} was a Japanese statesman and jurist of the [[Meiji period]].

Hozumi was born in [[Uwajima Domain]], [[Iyo Province]] (present-day [[Ehime Prefecture]]) as the second son to a family of ''[[kokugaku]]'' scholars. He graduated from the ''Kaisei Gakko'', (the forerunner to [[Tokyo Imperial University]]), and studied overseas from 1876-1881. He first traveled to [[Great Britain]], where he attended the [[University of London]] and obtained a license as a [[barrister]]. He then traveled to [[Germany]], where he attended the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]].

On his return to Japan, he accepted a post as a professor of [[German law]] and of comparative law at Tokyo Imperial University. Together with a group of fellow lawyers, he was a founder of the English Law School, the forerunner of [[Chuo University]], in 1885. In 1888, he was awarded the first [[doctorate of law]] in Japan (法学博士). Together with [[Ume Kenjirō]] and [[Tomii Masaaki]], he was requested to draft Japan’s [[Civil Code]] in 1898. One of his most accomplished students was [[Kijūrō Shidehara]] who passed the examination to enter the diplomatic service in 1896, and was Foreign Minister in the 1920s and Prime Minister after World War II.

Hozumi was appointed to the [[House of Peers (Japan)|House of Peers]] in 1890, and the [[Privy Council (Japan)|Privy Council]] in 1916. He was ennobled with the title of ''danshaku'' ([[baron]]) in 1915 under the ''[[kazoku]]'' peerage system.

He was the father of legal scholar [[Hozumi Shigeto]] and brother to constitutional expert [[Hozumi Yatsuka]].

[[File:P1300846.jpg|thumb|right|"I would rather be a bridge used by everyone than be a statue." -- [[Nobushige Hozumi]] ]]
After his death, there was a discussion in [[Uwajima, Ehime|Uwajima city]] to erect a bronze statue in his honor. However, Hozumi specifically left instructions in his will that if future generations wanted to honor him, it would be better to honor him with something useful, like a bridge, rather than something as worthless as a statue. The “Hozumi Bridge” still exists in Uwajima city to this day. He was also honored by a Japanese [[commemorative postage stamp]] in 1998.

The '''insanity defense''', also known as the '''mental disorder defense''', is an affirmative  [[Defense (legal)|defense]] by [[excuse]] in a [[criminal case]], arguing that the defendant is not responsible for his or her actions due to an episodic or persistent [[mental illness|psychiatric disease]] at the time of the criminal act. This is contrasted with an excuse of [[provocation (legal)|provocation]], in which defendant is responsible, but the responsibility is lessened due to a temporary mental state.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;''Criminal Law - Cases and Materials'', 7th ed. 2012, [[Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business]]; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], [[Guyora Binder]], {{ISBN|978-1-4548-0698-1}}, {{cite web |url=https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-05-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007173248/https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/ |archivedate=2016-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|613}} It is also contrasted with a finding that a defendant cannot stand trial in a criminal case because a mental disease prevents him or her from effectively assisting counsel, from a [[civil case|civil]] finding in [[Trust law|trusts]] and [[estate (law)|estate]]s where a will is nullified because it was made when a mental disorder prevented a [[testator]] from recognizing the natural objects of their bounty, and from involuntary [[civil commitment]] to a mental institution, when anyone is found to be [[gravely disabled]] or to be a danger to themselves or to others.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;{{rp|613}}

Exemption from full criminal punishment on such grounds dates back to at least the [[Code of Hammurabi]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, G. (1998) Basic Concepts of Criminal Law. NY: Oxford Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal definitions of insanity or mental disorder are varied, and include the [[M'Naghten Rule]], the [[Durham rule]], the [[1953 British Royal Commission on Capital Punishment report]], the [[ALI rule]] (American Legal Institute Model Penal Code rule), and other provisions, often relating to a lack of ''[[mens rea]]'' ("guilty mind").&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;{{rp|613–635}}&lt;ref name=Cornell1&gt;{{cite web|title=The insanity defense and diminished capacity|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/background/insane/insanity.html|work=Legal Information Institute: Federal Law|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=19 December 2011|author=Legal Information Institute|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102214102/http://www.law.cornell.edu/background/insane/insanity.html|archivedate=2 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[criminal law]]s of Australia and Canada, statutory legislation enshrines the ''M'Naghten Rules'', with the terms '''defense of mental disorder''', '''defense of mental illness''' or '''not criminally responsible by reason of mental disorder''' employed. Being '''incapable of distinguishing right from wrong''' is one basis for being found to be [[legally insane]] as a [[criminal defense]].&lt;ref name="CL"/&gt; It originated in the ''M'Naghten Rule'', and has been reinterpreted and modernized through more recent cases, such as ''[[People v. Serravo]]''.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;{{rp|615–625}}

In the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the United States, use of the defense is rare;&lt;ref name="Schmalleger"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmalleger|first=Frank|title=Criminal Justice: A Brief Introduction|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2001|isbn=0-13-088729-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, since the Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/25/section/3 |title=Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1991 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010070152/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/25/section/3 |archivedate=2013-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; insanity pleas have steadily increased in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;RD Mackay, BJ Mitchell, L Howe (2006) 'Yet more facts about the insanity defence' ''Criminal Law Review'' 399-411&lt;/ref&gt;  Mitigating factors, including things not eligible for the insanity defense such as [[alcohol intoxication|intoxication]]&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association: The Insanity Defense: Position Statement. Washington, DC: APA Document Reference No. 820002, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; (or, more frequently, [[diminished capacity]]), may lead to reduced charges or reduced sentences.

The defense is based on evaluations by [[Forensic psychology|forensic mental health professionals]] with the appropriate test according to the jurisdiction. Their testimony guides the jury, but they are not allowed to testify to the accused's criminal responsibility, as this is a matter for the jury to decide. Similarly, mental health practitioners are restrained from making a judgment on the issue of whether the defendant is or is not insane or what is known as the "ultimate issue".&lt;ref name="shapirointer"&gt;{{cite book

|isbn= 0-205-12521-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some jurisdictions require the evaluation to address the defendant's ability to control their behavior at the time of the offense (the volitional limb). A defendant claiming the defense is pleading "'''not guilty by reason of insanity'''" ('''NGRI''') or "'''guilty but insane or mentally ill'''" in some jurisdictions which, if successful, may result in the defendant being committed to a psychiatric facility for an indeterminate period.

==Mitigating factors and diminished capacity==
The [[United States Supreme Court]] (in ''[[Penry v. Lynaugh]]'') and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] (in ''[[Bigby v. Dretke]]'') have been clear in their decisions that [[jury instructions]] in death penalty cases that do not ask about [[mitigating factor]]s regarding the defendant's [[mental health]] violate the defendant's [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] rights, saying that the jury is to be instructed to consider mitigating factors when answering unrelated questions. This ruling suggests specific explanations to the jury are necessary to weigh mitigating factors.

Diminished responsibility or diminished capacity can be employed as a mitigating factor or [[partial defense]] to crimes and, in the United States, is applicable to more circumstances than the insanity defense. The Homicide Act 1957 is the statutory basis for the defense of diminished responsibility in England and Wales, whereas in Scotland it is a product of case law. The number of findings of diminished responsibility has been matched by a fall in unfitness to plead and insanity findings (Walker, 1968). A plea of diminished capacity is different from a plea of insanity in that "reason of insanity" is a full defense while "diminished capacity" is merely a plea to a lesser crime.&lt;ref name=Cornell&gt;{{cite web|title=Diminished capacity, as opposed to not guilty by reason of insanity|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/background/insane/capacity.html|work=Legal Information Institute: Federal Law|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=19 December 2011|author=Legal Information Institute|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008212843/http://www.law.cornell.edu/background/insane/capacity.html|archivedate=8 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non compos mentis==
''Non compos mentis'' (Latin) is a legal term meaning "not of sound mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesaurus.com/browse/non+compos+mentis|title=I found great synonyms for "non compos mentis" on the new Thesaurus.com!|website=www.thesaurus.com|accessdate=2 February 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202190351/http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/non+compos+mentis|archivedate=2 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Non compos mentis'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''non'' meaning "not", ''compos'' meaning "having command" or "composed", and ''mentis'' ([[genitive]] [[Grammatical number|singular]] of ''[[mens]]''), meaning "of mind". It is the direct opposite of ''[[Compos mentis]]'' (of a sound mind).

Although typically used in law, this term can also be used metaphorically or figuratively; e.g. when one is in a confused state, intoxicated, or not of sound mind. The term may be applied when a determination of competency needs to be made by a physician for purposes of obtaining [[informed consent]] for treatments and, if necessary, assigning a surrogate to make health care decisions.  While the proper sphere for this determination is in a court of law, this is practically, and most frequently, made by physicians in the clinical setting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/18/1834 Assessment of Patients' Competence to Consent to Treatment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104083723/http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/18/1834 |date=2007-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English law, the rule of ''non compos mentis'' was most commonly used when the defendant invoked religious or magical explanations for behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/calr12&amp;div=18&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=History of Insanity as a Defence to Crime in English Criminal Law

==Withdrawal or refusal of defense==
Several cases have ruled that persons found not guilty by reason of insanity may not withdraw the defense in a [[habeas]] petition to pursue an alternative, although there have been exceptions in other rulings.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} In State v. Connelly, 700 A.2d 694 (Conn. App. Ct. 1997), the petitioner who had originally been found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed for ten years to the jurisdiction of a Psychiatric Security Review Board, filed a [[pro se]] writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' and the court vacated his insanity acquittal. He was granted a new trial and found guilty of the original charges, receiving a prison sentence of 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In the [[landmark case]] of ''[[Frendak v. United States]]'' in 1979, the court ruled that the insanity defense cannot be imposed upon an unwilling defendant if an intelligent defendant voluntarily wishes to forgo the defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Those found to have been not guilty by reason of mental disorder or insanity are generally then required to undergo [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] treatment in a mental institution{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}, except in the case of '''temporary insanity''' ([[#Temporary insanity|see below]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}  In England and Wales, under the Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act of 1991 (amended by the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act, 2004 to remove the option of a guardianship order), the court can mandate a hospital order, a restriction order (where release from hospital requires the permission of the Home Secretary), a "supervision and treatment" order, or an absolute discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1991, Chapter 25|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/25/introduction|publisher=UK National Archives|author=legislation.gov.uk|date=27 June 1991|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113024929/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/25/introduction|archivedate=13 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Procedure|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/mentally_disordered_offenders/|work=Mentally Disordered Offenders|author=Crown Prosecution Service|year=2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120031107/http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/mentally_disordered_offenders/|archivedate=2011-11-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike defendants who are found guilty of a crime, they are not institutionalized for a fixed period, but rather held in the institution until they are determined not to be a threat.

In ''[[Foucha v. Louisiana]]'' (1992) the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that a person could not be held "indefinitely".

So far, in the United States, those acquitted of a federal offense by reason of insanity have not been able to challenge their psychiatric confinement through a [[writ of habeas corpus]] or other remedies. In ''[[Archuleta v. Hedrick]]'', 365 F.3d 644 (8th Cir. 2004), the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]] the court ruled persons found not guilty by reason of insanity and later want to challenge their confinement may not attack their initial successful insanity defense:
{{quotation|The appellate court affirmed the lower court’s judgment: "Having thus elected to make himself a member of that ‘exceptional class’ of persons who seek verdicts of not guilty by reason of insanity...he cannot now be heard to complain of the statutory consequences of his election." The court held that no direct attack upon the final judgment of acquittal by reason of insanity was possible. It also held that the collateral attack that he was not informed that a possible alternative to his commitment was to ask for a new trial was not a meaningful alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Incompetency and mental illness===
An important distinction to be made is the difference between [[Competency evaluation (law)|competency]] and criminal responsibility.
*The issue of competency is whether a defendant is able to adequately assist his attorney in preparing a defense, make informed decisions about trial strategy and whether to plead guilty, accept a plea agreement or plead not guilty. This issue is dealt with in [[UK]] law as "[[fitness to plead]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/mentally_disordered_offenders/|title=Mentally Disordered Offenders - The Crown Prosecution Service|website=www.cps.gov.uk|accessdate=2 February 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115112901/http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/mentally_disordered_offenders/|archivedate=15 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competency largely deals with the defendant's present condition, while criminal responsibility addresses the condition at the time the crime was committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.michiganprosecutor.org/alger/Articles/Criminal%2520Responsibility.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229110609/http://michiganprosecutor.org/alger/Articles/Criminal%20Responsibility.doc |archivedate=2010-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a trial in which the insanity defense is invoked typically involves the testimony of [[psychiatrist]]s or [[psychologist]]s who will, as [[expert witness]]es, present opinions on the defendant's state of mind at the time of the offense.

Therefore, a person whose mental disorder is not in dispute is determined to be sane if the court decides that despite a "mental illness" the defendant was responsible for the acts committed and will be treated in court as a normal defendant. If the person has a mental illness and it is determined that the mental illness interfered with the person's ability to determine right from wrong (and other associated criteria a jurisdiction may have) and if the person is willing to plead guilty or is proven guilty in a court of law, some jurisdictions have an alternative option known as either a '''Guilty but Mentally Ill''' ('''GBMI''') or a '''Guilty but Insane''' verdict. The GBMI verdict is available as an alternative to, rather than in lieu of, a "not guilty by reason of insanity" verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Temporary insanity==
The notion of '''temporary insanity''' argues that a defendant ''was'' insane during the commission of a crime, but they later regained their sanity after the criminal act was carried out. This legal defense is commonly used to defend individuals that have committed [[crimes of passion]].  The defense was first successfully used by [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] [[Daniel Sickles]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1859 after he had killed his wife's lover, [[Philip Barton Key (1818-1859)|Philip Barton Key]].&lt;ref name="NYT_1881"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/harp/1210.html |title=On This Day: December 10, 1881 |last=Kennedy |first=Robert C. |date=2001 |work=The New York Times |access-date=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the defense became more common during the 1940s and 1950s.

==History==
The concept of defense by insanity has existed since [[ancient Greece]] and [[Roman Empire|Rome]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} However, in [[colonial America]] a [[delusion]]al [[Dorothy Talbye Trial|Dorothy Talbye]] was [[hanged]] in 1638 for murdering her daughter, as at the time [[Massachusetts]]'s [[common law]] made no distinction between [[insanity]] (or [[mental illness]]) and criminal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], under English Common law, declared that a person was insane if their mental capacity was no more than that of a "wild beast" (in the sense of a dumb animal, rather than being frenzied).  The first complete transcript of an insanity trial dates to 1724. It is likely that the insane, like those under 14, were spared [[trial by ordeal]]. When trial by jury replaced this, the jury members were expected to find the insane guilty but then refer the case to the King for a Royal Pardon. From 1500 onwards, juries could acquit the insane, and detention required a separate civil procedure (Walker, 1985).&lt;!--This citation needs to be in wiki format, not APA--&gt; The [[Criminal Lunatics Act 1800]], passed with retrospective effect following the acquittal of [[James Hadfield]], mandated detention at the regent's pleasure (indefinitely) even for those who, although insane at the time of the offence, were now sane.

The [[M'Naghten Rules]] of 1843 were not a codification or definition of insanity but rather the responses of a panel of judges to hypothetical questions posed by Parliament in the wake of [[Daniel M'Naghten]]'s acquittal for the homicide of Edward Drummond, whom he mistook for [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Prime Minister]] [[Robert Peel]]. The rules define the defense as "at the time of committing the act the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or as not to know that what he was doing was wrong."&lt;ref name="M'Naghten's case"&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=Daniel M'Naghten's case|date=19 June 1843 |court=UKHL |year=1843 |num=J16 |parallelcite=(1843) 8 Eng Rep 718; [1843] ALL ER Rep 229 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The key is that the defendant could not appreciate the nature of his actions during the commission of the crime.

In ''[[Ford v. Wainwright]]'' 477 U.S. 399 (1986), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] upheld the [[common law]] rule that the insane cannot be [[Capital punishment in the United States|executed]]. It further stated that a person under the death penalty is entitled to a [[competency evaluation (law)|competency evaluation]] and to an evidentiary hearing in court on the question of his competency to be executed.&lt;ref name="supct"&gt;{{cite web

In ''[[Wainwright v.

==United States law==
In the United States, variances in the insanity defense between states, and in the federal court system, are attributable to differences with respect to three key issues:
#'''Availability''': whether the jurisdiction allows a defendant to raise the insanity defense,
#'''Definition''': when the defense is available, what facts will support a finding of insanity, and
#'''Burden of proof''': whether the defendant has the duty of proving insanity or the prosecutor has the duty of disproving insanity, and by what [[Burden of proof (law)|standard of proof]].

===Availability===
In the United States, a criminal defendant may plead insanity in federal court, and in the state courts of every state except for Idaho, Kansas, Montana, and Utah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Insanity Defense Among the States|url=http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-procedure/the-insanity-defense-among-the-states.html|website=FindLaw|accessdate=20 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020195020/http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-procedure/the-insanity-defense-among-the-states.html|archivedate=20 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="el"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is the Insanity Defense|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/what-insanity-defense|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=20 October 2017|date=13 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021003524/https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/what-insanity-defense|archivedate=21 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, defendants in states that disallow the insanity defense may still be able to demonstrate that a defendant was not capable of forming intent to commit a crime as a result of mental illness.&lt;ref name="el"/&gt;

===Definition===
Each state and the federal court system currently uses one of the following "tests" to define insanity for purposes of the insanity defense. Over its decades of use the definition of insanity has been modified by statute, with changes to the availability of the insanity defense, what constitutes legal insanity whether the prosecutor or defendant has the burden of proof, the standard of proof required at trial, trial procedures, and to commitment and release procedures for defendants who have been acquitted based on a finding of insanity.&lt;ref name="posthink"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Callahan|first1=Lisa|last2=Meyer|first2=Connie|last3=Steadman|first3=Henry J.|title=Insanity Defense Reform in the United States - Post Hinckley|journal=Mental &amp; Physical Disability Law Reporter|date=1987|volume=11|jstor=20784052|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/menphydis11&amp;div=20&amp;id=&amp;page=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180605032820/http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals%2Fmenphydis11&amp;div=20&amp;id=&amp;page=|archivedate=2018-06-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====M'Naghten test====
The guidelines for the ''[[M'Naghten Rules]]'', state, ''inter alia'', and evaluating the criminal responsibility for defendants claiming to be insane were settled in the British courts in the case of Daniel M'Naghten in 1843.&lt;ref name="M'Naghten's case"/&gt; M'Naghten was a Scottish woodcutter who killed the secretary to the prime minister, [[Edward Drummond]], in a botched attempt to assassinate the prime minister himself. M'Naghten apparently believed that the prime minister was the architect of the myriad of personal and financial misfortunes that had befallen him.&lt;ref name="hottop"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Starer|first1=Daniel|title=Hot Topics: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About the Fifty Major Controversies|date=1995|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=0671887084|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cq5sKxq5QcwC|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his trial, nine witnesses testified to the fact that he was insane, and the jury acquitted him, finding him "not guilty by reason of insanity."&lt;ref name="hottop"/&gt;

The [[House of Lords]] asked the judges of the common law courts to answer five questions on insanity as a criminal defence,&lt;ref&gt;Carl Elliott, ''The rules of insanity: moral responsibility and the mentally ill offender'', SUNY Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-7914-2951-2}}, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael T. Molan, Mike Molan, Duncan Bloy, Denis Lanser, ''Modern criminal law'' (5 ed), Routledge Cavendish, 2003, {{ISBN|1-85941-807-4}}, p.352&lt;/ref&gt; and the formulation that emerged from their review—that a defendant should not be held responsible for his actions only if, as a result of his mental disease or defect, he (i) did not know that his act would be wrong; or (ii) did not understand the nature and quality of his actions—became the basis of the law governing legal responsibility in cases of insanity in England. Under the rules, loss of control because of mental illness was no defense{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}. The M'Naghten rule was embraced with almost no modification by American courts and legislatures for more than 100 years, until the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name="M'Naghten's case"/&gt;

====''Durham''/New Hampshire test====
The strict M'Naghten standard for the insanity defense was widely used until the 1950s and the case of ''[[Durham v. United States (1954)|Durham v. United States]]'' case.&lt;ref name="hottop"/&gt; In the ''Durham'' case, the court ruled that a defendant is entitled to acquittal if the crime was the ''product of'' his mental illness (i.e., crime would not have been committed but for the disease). The test, also called the Product Test, is broader than either the M'Naghten test or the [[irresistible impulse test]]. The test has more lenient guidelines for the insanity defense, but it addressed the issue of convicting mentally ill defendants, which was allowed under the M'Naghten Rule.&lt;ref name="M'Naghten's case"/&gt; However, the Durham standard drew much criticism because of its expansive definition of legal insanity.

====Model Penal Code test====
The [[Model Penal Code]], published by the American Law Institute, provides a standard for legal insanity that serves as a compromise between the strict M'Naghten Rule, the lenient Durham ruling, and the irresistible impulse test. Under the MPC standard, which represents the modern trend, a defendant is not responsible for criminal conduct "if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks ''substantial capacity'' either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law." The test thus takes into account both the cognitive and volitional capacity of insanity.

====Federal courts====
After the [[John Hinckley, Jr.|perpetrator]] of [[Reagan assassination attempt|President Reagan's assassination attempt]] was found not guilty by reason of insanity, Congress passed the [[Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984]].  Under this act, the [[legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] was shifted from the prosecution to the defense and the standard of evidence in federal trials was increased from a [[preponderance of the evidence|preponderance of evidence]] to [[clear and convincing evidence]].  The ALI test was discarded in favor of a new test that more closely resembled M'Naghten's. Under this new test only perpetrators suffering from severe mental illnesses at the time of the crime could successfully employ the insanity defense. The defendant's ability to control himself or herself was no longer a consideration.

The Act also curbed the scope of expert psychiatric testimony and adopted stricter procedures regarding the hospitalization and release of those found not guilty by reason of insanity.

====Guilty but mentally ill====
As an alternative to the insanity defense, some jurisdictions permit a defendant to plead guilty but mentally ill.&lt;ref name="posthink"/&gt; A defendant who is found guilty but mentally ill may be sentenced to mental health treatment, at the conclusion of which the defendant will serve the remainder of his or her sentence in the same manner as any other defendant.&lt;ref name="el"/&gt;

===Burden of proof===
In a majority of states, the burden of proving insanity is placed on the defendant, who must prove insanity by a preponderance of the evidence.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable sources (State Codes?) needed|date=January 2017}}

In a minority of states, the burden is placed on the prosecution, who must prove sanity beyond a reasonable doubt.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable sources (State Codes?) needed|date=January 2017}}

In federal court, and in Arizona, the burden is placed on the defendant, who must prove insanity by clear and convincing evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Attorneys' Manual, Criminal Resource Manual Sec. 638.

Sec. 17(b); see also A.R.S. Sec. 13-502(C).

===Controversy===
The insanity plea is used in the U.S Criminal Justice System in less than 1% of all [[Criminal law|criminal]] cases.&lt;ref name=Advocacy_Handbook/&gt; Little is known about the criminal justice system and the mentally ill:

{{quotation|It should be noted, however, that there is no ''definitive'' study regarding the percentage of people with mental illness who come into contact with police, appear as criminal defendants, are incarcerated, or are under community supervision. Furthermore, the scope of this issue varies across jurisdictions. Accordingly, advocates should rely as much as possible on statistics collected by local and state government agencies.&lt;ref name=Advocacy_Handbook&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some U.S. states have begun to ban the use of the insanity defense, and in 1994 the Supreme Court denied a petition of certiorari seeking review of a Montana Supreme Court case that upheld Montana's abolition of the defense.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/aron/scotus032994.htm Court: Insanity Defense Not a Right] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929095714/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/aron/scotus032994.htm |date=2017-09-29 }} Washington Post, March 29, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; [[Idaho]], [[Kansas]], and [[Utah]] have also banned the defense. However, a mentally ill defendant/patient can be found unfit to stand trial in these states. In 2001, the Nevada Supreme Court found that their state's abolition of the defense was unconstitutional as a violation of Federal due process.  In 2006, the Supreme Court decided ''[[Clark v. Arizona]]'' upheld Arizona's limitations on the insanity defense. In that same ruling, the Court noted "We have never held that the Constitution mandates an insanity defense, nor have we held that the Constitution does not so require."

The insanity defense is also complicated because of the underlying differences in philosophy between psychiatrists/psychologists and legal professionals.&lt;ref name=Forensic&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=Louis B.|title=Forensic science : an introduction to scientific and investigative techniques|year=2009|publisher=CRC Press/Taylor &amp; Francis Group|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=978-1-4200-6493-3|edition=3rd|editor=James, Stuart H. and Jon J. Nordby|pages=585–604|chapter=Forensic Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, a psychiatrist, psychologist or other mental health professional is often consulted as an expert witness in insanity cases, but the ultimate ''legal'' judgment of the defendant's sanity is determined by a jury, not by a psychologist.  In other words, psychologists provide testimony and professional opinion but are not ultimately responsible for answering legal questions.&lt;ref name="Forensic"/&gt;

==Australian law==
In Australia there are nine [[Jurisdiction (area)|law units]]. All may have varying rules (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20130412231404/http://www.aija.org.au/ac03/papers/DavidGrace.rtf]). In [[South Australia]], the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) provides that:

269C—Mental competence

A person is mentally incompetent to commit an offence if, at the time of the conduct alleged to give rise to the offence, the person is suffering from a mental impairment and, in consequence of the mental impairment—
:(a) does not know the nature and quality of the conduct; or
:(b) does not know that the conduct is wrong; or
:(c) is unable to control the conduct.
269H—Mental unfitness to stand trial

A person is mentally unfit to stand trial on a charge of an offence if the person's mental processes are so disordered or impaired that the person is—
:(a) unable to understand, or to respond rationally to, the charge or the allegations on which the charge is based; or
:(b)  unable to exercise (or to give rational instructions about the exercise of) procedural rights (such as, for example, the right to challenge jurors); or
:(c)  unable to understand the nature of the proceedings, or to follow the evidence or the course of the proceedings.

In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] the current defence of mental impairment was introduced in the ''Crimes (Mental Impairment and Unfitness to be Tried) Act'' 1997 which replaced the common law defence of insanity and indefinite detention at the governor's pleasure with the following:
:the accused was suffering from a mental impairment; and
:the mental impairment affected the accused so he or she either did not understand the nature and quality of the conduct, or did not know that it was wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Vic|act|ciautbta1997472|Crimes (Mental Impairment and Unfitness to be Tried) Act|20}} Defence of mental impairment.&lt;/ref&gt;
These requirements are almost identical to the M'Naghten Rules, substituting "mental impairment" for "disease of the mind".&lt;ref name="M'Naghten's case"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=Bratty v Attorney-General for Northern Ireland |year=1961 |court=UKHL |num=3 |date=3 October 1961 |parallelcite=[1963] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 386 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In New South Wales, the defence has been renamed the 'Defence of Mental Illness' in Part 4 of the ''Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|mhpa1990355|Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990}} Part 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, definitions of the defence are derived from M'Naghten's case and have not been codified. Whether a particular condition amounts to a disease of the mind is not a medical but a legal question to be decided in accordance with the ordinary rules of interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|49|1990|litigants=R v Falconer |parallelcite=(1990) 171 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 30 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This defence is an exception to the ''Woolmington v DPP'' (1935)  'golden thread',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=Woolmington v DPP |year=1935 |court=UKHL |num=1 |parallelcite=[1935] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 462 |date= |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as the party raising the issue of the defence of mental illness bears the burden of proving this defence on the balance of probabilities.&lt;ref name="R v Porter"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|1|1933|litigants=R v Porter |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1933/1.pdf (1933) 55 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 182] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the defence will raise the issue of insanity. However, the prosecution can raise it in exceptional circumstances: ''R v Ayoub (1984).'' &lt;ref&gt;''R v Ayoub'' (1984) 2 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 511.&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian cases have further qualified and explained the ''M'Naghten Rules''. The NSW Supreme Court has held there are two limbs to the ''M'Naghten Rules'', that the accused did not know what he was doing, or that the accused did not appreciate that what he was doing was morally wrong, in both cases the accused must be operating under a 'defect of reason, from a disease of the mind'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|789|2005|litigants=R v Jennings |date=11 August 2005 |pinoint=[26] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court in [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1933/1.html ''R v Porter''] stated that the condition of the accused’s mind is relevant only at the time of the [[actus reus]].&lt;ref  name="R v Porter"/&gt; In ''Woodbridge v The Queen'' the court stated that a symptom indicating a disease of the mind must be prone to recur and be the result of an underlying pathological infirmity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCCA|185|2010|litigants=Woodbridge v The Queen |parallelcite=(2010) 208 [[Australian Criminal Reports|A Crim R]] 503 at 531 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ‘defect of reason’ is the inability to think rationally and pertains to incapacity to reason, rather than having unsound ideas or difficulty with such a task.&lt;ref  name="R v Porter"/&gt; Examples of disease of the mind include Arteriosclerosis (considered so because the hardening of the arteries affects the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCCA|282|2000|litigants=R v Cheatham |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian law==

===Criminal Code provisions===
The defence of mental disorder is codified in section 16 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] which states, in part:
:''16. (1) No person is criminally responsible for an act committed or an [[omission (criminal law)|omission]] made while suffering from a [[mental disorder]] that rendered the person incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of the act or omission or of knowing that it was wrong.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=16. Defence of mental disorder|url=http://yourlaws.ca/criminal-code-canada/16-defence-mental-disorder|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210213557/http://yourlaws.ca/criminal-code-canada/16-defence-mental-disorder|archivedate=2015-12-10|df=|access-date=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To establish a claim of mental disorder the party raising the issue must show on a [[balance of probabilities]] first that the person who committed the act was suffering from a "disease of the mind", and second, that at the time of the offence they were either 1) unable to appreciate the "nature and quality" of the act, or 2) did not know it was "wrong".

The meaning of the word "wrong" was determined in the Supreme Court case of ''[[R. v. Chaulk]]'' [[Case citation#Canada|[1990] 3 S.C.R.]] which held that "wrong" was NOT restricted to "legally wrong" but to "morally wrong" as well.

===Post-verdict conditions===
The current legislative scheme was created by the [[Parliament of Canada]] after the previous scheme was found unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in ''[[R. v. Swain]]''.  The new provisions also replaced the old [[insanity defense]] with the current mental disorder defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Pilon |first=Marilyn |year=2002 |title=Mental Disorder and Canadian Criminal Law |publisher=[[Government of Canada]], Law and Government Division |url=http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/prb9922-e.htm |accessdate=10 September 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310030223/http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/prb9922-e.htm |archivedate=10 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a person is found not criminally responsible ("NCR"), he or she will have a hearing by a Review Board within 45 days (90 days if the court extends the delay). A Review Board is established under Part XX.1 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] and is composed of at least three members, a person who is a judge or eligible to be a judge, a psychiatrist and another expert in a relevant field, such as social work, criminology or psychology. Parties at a Review Board hearing are usually the accused, the Crown and the hospital responsible for the supervision or assessment of the accused. A Review Board is responsible for both accused persons found NCR or accused persons found unfit to stand trial on account of mental disorder. A Review Board dealing with an NCR offender must consider two questions: whether the accused is a "significant threat to the safety of the public" and, if so, what the "least onerous and least restrictive" restrictions on the liberty of the accused should be in order to mitigate such a threat. Proceedings before a Review Board are inquisitorial rather than adversarial. Often the Review Board will be active in conducting an inquiry. Where the Review Board is unable to conclude that the accused is a significant threat to the safety of the public, the review board must grant the accused an absolute discharge, an order essentially terminating the jurisdiction of the criminal law over the accused. Otherwise the Review Board must order that the accused be either discharged subject to conditions or detained in a hospital, both subject to conditions. The conditions imposed must be the least onerous and least restrictive necessary to mitigate any danger the accused may pose to others.

Since the Review Board is empowered under criminal law powers under s. 91(27) of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] the sole justification for its jurisdiction is public safety. Therefore, the nature of the inquiry is the danger the accused may pose to the public safety rather than whether the accused is "cured." For instance, many "sick" accused persons are discharged absolutely on the basis that they are not a danger to the public while many "sane" accused are detained on the basis that they are dangerous. Moreover, the notion of "significant threat to the safety of the public" is a "criminal threat." This means that the Review Board must find that the threat posed by the accused is of a criminal nature.

While proceedings before a Review Board are less formal than in court, there are many procedural safe-guards available to the accused given the potential indefinite nature of Part XX.1. Any party may appeal against the decision of a Review Board.

In 1992 when the new mental disorder provisions were enacted, Parliament included "capping" provisions which were to be enacted at a later date. These capping provisions limited the jurisdiction of a Review Board over an accused based on the maximum potential sentence had the accused been convicted (e.g. there would be a cap of 5 years if the maximum penalty for the index offence is 5 years). However, these provisions were never proclaimed into force and were subsequently repealed.

A Review Board must hold a hearing every 12 months (unless extended to 24 months) until the accused is discharged absolutely.

===Accused unfit to stand trial===
The issue of mental disorder may also come into play before a trial even begins, if the accused's mental state prevents the accused from being able to appreciate the nature of a trial and to conduct a defence.

An accused who is found to be unfit to stand trial is subject to the jurisdiction a Review Board. While the considerations are essentially the same, there are a few provisions which apply only to unfit accused. A Review Board must determine whether the accused is fit to stand trial. Regardless of the determination, the Review Board must then determine what conditions should be imposed on the accused, considering both the protection of the public and the maintenance of the fitness of the accused (or conditions which would render the accused fit). Previously an absolute discharge was unavailable to an unfit accused. However, in R. v. Demers, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] struck down the provision restricting the availability of an absolute discharge to an accused person who is deemed both "permanently unfit" and not a significant threat to the safety of the public. Presently a Review Board may recommend a judicial stay of proceedings in the event that it finds the accused both "permanently unfit" and non-dangerous. The decision is left to the court having jurisdiction over the accused.

An additional requirement for an unfit accused is the holding of a "prima facie case" hearing every two years. The Crown must demonstrate to the court having jurisdiction over the accused that it still has sufficient evidence to try the accused. If the Crown fails to meet this burden then the accused is discharged and proceedings are terminated. The nature of the hearing is virtually identical to that of a [[preliminary hearing]].

==Scottish law==
The Scottish Law Commission, in its Discussion Paper No 122 on Insanity and Diminished Responsibility (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/downloads/dp122_insanity.pdf |title=Scottish Law Commission :: |publisher=Scotlawcom.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717012535/http://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/downloads/dp122_insanity.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; pp.&amp;nbsp;16/18, confirms that the law has not substantially changed from the position stated in Hume's Commentaries:
:We may next attend to the case of those unfortunate persons, who have plead the miserable defense of idiocy or insanity. Which condition, if it is not an assumed or imperfect, but a genuine and thorough insanity, and is proved by the testimony of intelligent witnesses, makes the act like that of an infant, and equally bestows the privilege of an entire exemption from any manner of pain; ''Cum alterum innocentia concilii tuetur, alterum fati infelicitas excusat''. I say, where the insanity is absolute, and is duly proved: For if reason and humanity enforce the plea in these circumstances, it is no less necessary to observe a caution and reserve in applying the law, as shall hinder it from being understood, that there is any privilege in a case of mere weakness of intellect, or a strange and moody humor, or a crazy and capricious or irritable temper. In none of these situations does or can the law excuse the offender. Because such constitutions are not exclusive of a competent understanding of the true state of the circumstances in which the deed is done, nor of the subsistence of some steady and evil passion, grounded in those circumstances, and directed to a certain object. To serve the purpose of a defense in law, the disorder must therefore amount to an absolute alienation of reason, ''ut continua mentis alienatione, omni intellectu careat'' - such a disease as deprives the patient of the knowledge of the true aspect and position of things about him - hinders him from distinguishing friend from foe - and gives him up to the impulse of his own distempered fancy.
The phrase "absolute alienation of reason" is still regarded as at the core of the defense in the modern law (see ''HM Advocate v Kidd'' (1960) JC 61 and ''Brennan v HM Advocate'' (1977)

==Nordic countries==
In the [[Nordic countries]], insanity is not a defense; instead, it is the responsibility of the court system as such to consider whether the accused may have been psychotic or suffering from other severe mental defects when perpetrating the criminal act. This explains why, in Norway, the court considered the sanity of [[Anders Behring Breivik]], even if he himself declared to be sane.

Rules differ between Nordic countries.

In Sweden, psychotic perpetrators are seen as accountable, but the sanction is, if they are psychotic at the time of the trial, forensic mental care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Silfverhielm|first=Helena|title=Concepts and Procedures in the Member States – Sweden|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_projects/2002/promotion/fp_promotion_2002_frep_15_en.pdf|work=Salize &amp; Dressing (2005Placement and Treatment of Mentally Ill Offenders – Legislation and Practice in EU Member States. Final Report. Mannheim.|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=July 16, 2012|pages=215–224|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608053719/http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_projects/2002/promotion/fp_promotion_2002_frep_15_en.pdf|archivedate=June 8, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Denmark and Norway, psychotic perpetrators are declared guilty, but not punished. Instead of prison, they are sentenced to mandatory treatment. Still, important differences exist between Norway and Denmark.

In Norway, §44 of the penal code states specifically that "a person who at the time of the crime was insane or unconscious is not punished".&lt;ref name="Penal Code of Norway"&gt;{{cite web|title=LOV 1902-05-22 nr 10: Almindelig borgerlig Straffelov (Straffeloven)|url=http://www.lovdata.no/all/hl-19020522-010.html|publisher=Lovdata|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Denmark, §16 of the penal code states that "Persons, who, at the time of the act, were irresponsible owing to mental illness or similar conditions or
to a pronounced mental deficiency, are not punishable".&lt;ref name=Kramp&gt;{{cite web|last=Kramp|first=Peter|title=Concepts and Procedures in the Member States – Denmark|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_projects/2002/promotion/fp_promotion_2002_frep_15_en.pdf|work=Salize &amp; Dressing (2005): Placement and Treatment of Mentally Ill Offenders – Legislation and Practice in EU Member States|publisher=EU Commission|accessdate=July 16, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608053719/http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_projects/2002/promotion/fp_promotion_2002_frep_15_en.pdf|archivedate=June 8, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that in Denmark, 'insanity' is a legal term rather than a medical term and that the court retains the authority to decide whether an accused person is irresponsible or not.&lt;ref name="Kramp"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sparr&gt;{{cite web|last=Sparr|first=Landy F.|title=Personality Disorders and Criminal Law: An International Perspective|url=http://www.jaapl.org/content/37/2/168.full|work=Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law Online|publisher=American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|date=June 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413212030/http://www.jaapl.org/content/37/2/168.full|archivedate=2013-04-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finland, punishments can only be administered if the accused is ''[[compos mentis]]'', of sound mind; not if the accused is insane (''syyntakeeton'', literally "unable to guarantee [shoulder the responsibility of] guilt"). Thus, an insane defendant may be [[Corpus delicti|found guilty based on the facts]] and his actions just as a sane defendant, but the insanity will only affect the punishment. The definition of insanity is similar to the M'Naught criterion above: "the accused is insane, if during the act, due to a mental illness, profound mental retardation or a severe disruption of mental health or consciousness, he cannot understand the actual nature of his act or its illegality, or that his ability to control his behavior is critically weakened". If an accused is suspected to be insane, the court must consult the [[National Institute for Health and Welfare (Finland)|National Institute for Health and Welfare]] (THL), which is obliged to place the accused in [[involuntary commitment]] if he is found insane. The offender receives no judicial punishment; he becomes a patient under the jurisdiction of THL, and must be released immediately once the conditions of involuntary commitment are no longer fulfilled. Diminished responsibility is also available, resulting in lighter sentences.

==Usage and success rate==
This increased coverage gives the impression that the defense is widely used, but this is not the case. According to an eight-state study, the insanity defense is used in less than 1% of all court cases and, when used, has only a 26% success rate.&lt;ref name="Schmalleger"/&gt;  Of those cases that were successful, 90% of the defendants had been previously diagnosed with mental illness.&lt;ref name="Schmalleger"/&gt;

Under [[United States tax law]], '''itemized deductions''' are eligible expenses that individual taxpayers can claim on federal income [[Tax return (United States)|tax return]]s and which decrease their taxable income, and is claimable in place of a [[standard deduction]], if available.

Most taxpayers are allowed a choice between the itemized deductions and the standard deduction. After computing their [[adjusted gross income]] (AGI), taxpayers can itemize deductions (from a list of allowable items) and subtract those itemized deductions (and any applicable [[United States Federal Income Tax Personal Exemption|personal exemption deductions]]) from their AGI amount to arrive at the [[taxable income]]. Alternatively, they can elect to subtract the [[standard deduction]] for their filing status (and any applicable personal exemption deduction) to arrive at the taxable income. In other words, the taxpayer may generally deduct the total itemized deduction amount, or the applicable standard deduction amount, whichever is greater.

The choice between the standard deduction and itemizing involves a number of considerations:

* Only a taxpayer eligible for the standard deduction can choose it.
* U.S. citizens and [[Alien (law)|alien]]s who are [[resident for tax purposes]] are eligible to claim the standard deduction. [[Nonresident alien]]s are not eligible. 
* If the taxpayer is filing as "married, filing separately", and his or her spouse itemizes, then the taxpayer cannot claim the standard deduction. In other words, a taxpayer whose spouse itemizes deductions must either itemize as well, or claim "0" (zero) as the amount of the standard deduction.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irs.gov/app/vita/basic_module.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;
* The taxpayer must have maintained the records required to substantiate the itemized deductions.
* If the amounts of the itemized deductions and the standard deduction do not differ much, the taxpayer may take the standard deduction to reduce the possibility of adjustment by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS). The amount of standard deduction cannot be changed following an audit unless the taxpayer's [[Filing Status (federal income tax)|filing status]] changes.
* If the taxpayer is otherwise eligible to file a shorter tax form such as [[1040EZ]] or [[1040A]], he or she would prefer not to prepare (or pay to prepare) the more complicated [[Form 1040]] and the associated Schedule A for itemized deductions.
* The standard deduction is not allowed for calculating the [[alternative minimum tax]] (AMT). If the taxpayer claims the standard deduction for regular income tax, he or she cannot itemize deductions for the AMT. Thus, for a taxpayer who pays the AMT (i.e., their AMT is higher than regular tax), it may be better to itemize deductions, even if it produces a result which is less than the standard deduction.

Deductions are reported in the tax year in which the eligible expenses were paid. For example, an annual membership fee for a professional association paid in December 2009 for year 2010 is deductible in year 2009.

==Examples of allowable itemized deductions==

There are a number of allowable deductions:

* Medical expenses, to the extent that the expenses exceed 10% of the taxpayer's [[Adjusted gross income|AGI]] (changed from 7.5% as of January 1, 2013 except for individuals 65 and over, who will use the 7.5% floor until January 1, 2017).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/2013-changes-to-itemized-deduction-for-medical-expenses&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., a taxpayer with an AGI of $20,000 and medical expenses of $5,000 would be eligible to deduct $3000 of their medical expenses ( 20,000 X .10 = 2000; 5000 - 2000 = 3000 ).) The 10% floor means that most taxpayers are unable to take advantage of the medical expense deduction. Allowable medical expenses include:
** Capital expenditures that are advised by a physician, where the facility is used primarily by the patient alone and the expense is reasonable (e.g., a swimming pool for someone with degenerative spinal disorder, an elevator for someone with heart disease)
** Payments to doctors, dentists, surgeons, chiropractors, psychologists, counselors, physical therapists, osteopaths, podiatrists, home health care nurses, cost of care for chronic cognitive impairment
** Premiums for medical insurance (but not if paid by another, or with [[Cafeteria plan|pre-tax money]])
** Premiums for qualifying long-term-care insurance, depending on the taxpayer's age
** Payments for prescription drugs and insulin
** Payments for devices needed to treat or compensate for a medical condition (crutches, wheelchairs, prescription eyeglasses, hearing aids)
** Mileage for travel to and from doctors and medical treatment
** Necessary travel expenses
**Non-deductible medical expenses include:
*** Over-the-counter medications
*** Health club memberships (to improve general health &amp; fitness)
*** Cosmetic surgery (except to restore normal appearance after an injury or to treat a genetic deformity)
* State and local taxes paid, but the entire sum of this category is capped at $10,000 starting in 2018&lt;ref&gt;http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/20/pf/salt-deductions-new-tax-plan/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;. These include:
** Either the entire year's [[State income tax|Income taxes]] or the entire year's state and local general [[Sales taxes in the United States|sales taxes]], but not both. 
** [[Property tax in the United States|Property taxes]], including vehicle registration fee, if assessed by reference to the value of the property. This amount is in addition to the previous choice of either income or sales tax.
** but not including:
*** [[Use tax]]es
*** [[Excise tax]]es
*** [[Fine (penalty)|Fines or penalties]]
* Mortgage interest expense on debt incurred in connection with up to two homes, subject to limits (up to $1,000,000 in purchase debt, or $100,000 in home equity loans)
** also, points paid to discount the interest rate on up to two homes; points paid upon acquisition are immediately deductible, but points paid on a refinance must be [[amortize]]d (deducted in equal parts over the lifetime of the loan)
** also private mortgage insurance premiums through 2010
* Investment interest expenses (interest paid to borrow money used for investing), up to the amount of income reported from investments (the balance is deferred until more investment income is declared)
* Charitable contributions to allowable recipients; this deduction is limited to either 30% or 50% of AGI, depending on the characterization of the recipient. Donations can be made as money, or in the form of goods. The value of donated services cannot be deducted as a contribution. Reasonable expenses necessary to provide donated services can, however, be deducted (such as mileage, special uniforms, or meals). Non-cash donations valued at more than $500 require special substantiation on a separate form. Non-cash donations are deductible at the lesser of the donor's cost or the current fair market value, unless the non-cash donation has been held for greater than a year (Long term), in which case it can be deducted at fair market value.
**Eligible recipients for charitable contributions include:
*** Churches, synagogues, mosques, other houses of worship
*** Federal, state, or local government entities
*** Fraternal or veterans' organizations
**Non-eligible recipients include:
*** Individuals
*** Political campaigns or [[political action committee]]s (PACs)
* {{anchor|casualty}} Casualty and theft losses, to the extent that they exceed 10% of the taxpayer's AGI (in aggregate), and $100 (per event, $500 starting tax year 2009)
** After [[Hurricane Sandy]] many areas of [[Connecticut]], [[New Jersey]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]  have been declared  disaster areas. This facilitates  amendments to 2011 tax returns to claim a casualty tax deduction.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/waggoner/2012/11/01/waggoner-investing-tax-deduction-catastrophe/1674479/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gambling losses, but only to the extent of gambling income (For example, a person who wins $1,000 in various gambling activities during the tax year and loses $800 in other gambling activities can deduct the $800 in losses, resulting in net gambling income of $200. By contrast, a person who wins $3,000 in various gambling activities during the year and loses $3,500 in other gambling activities in that year can deduct only $3,000 of the losses against the $3,000 in income, resulting in a break-even gambling activity for tax purposes for that year—with no deduction for the remaining $500 excess loss.)  Worth noting to this rule is that unused non-professional gambling losses may not be carried forward to subsequent tax years.  In contrast, however, this rule does not apply to professional gamblers, who are allowed to deduct losses from other income.

==Miscellaneous itemized deductions==

Regardless of miscellaneous itemized deductions allowed in 26 U.S.C. § 67, for the taxable years 2018 through 2025, no miscellaneous itemized deductions are allowed for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 207, and before January 1, 2026 (See U.S.C. § 67(g)). 

It is important to distinguish miscellaneous itemized deductions from other "normal" itemized deductions.  The reason for this is because miscellaneous itemized deductions are subject to a 2% floor,&lt;ref name="MID"&gt;26 U.S.C. § 67&lt;/ref&gt; a.k.a. the "2% Haircut."  A taxpayer can only deduct the amount of miscellaneous itemized deductions that exceed 2% of their adjusted gross income.&lt;ref name="26 U.S.C"&gt;26 U.S.C.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if a taxpayer has adjusted gross income of $50,000 with $4,000 in miscellaneous itemized deductions, the taxpayer can only deduct $3,000, since the first $1,000 is below the 2% floor.

There are 12 deductions listed in 26 U.S.C. § 67(b).  These are not miscellaneous itemized deductions, and thus not subject to the 2% floor (although they may have their own rules).  Any deduction not found in section 67(b) is a miscellaneous itemized deduction.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. § 67(b)&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples include the following.

* Job-related clothing or equipment, such as steel-toed boots, hardhats, uniforms (if they are not suited for social wear: suits and tuxedoes are not deductible, even if the taxpayer does not like to wear them, but nurses' and police uniforms are), tools and equipment required for work
* Union dues 
* Unreimbursed work-related expenses, such as travel or education (so long as the education does not qualify the taxpayer for a new line of work; law school, for example, is not deductible) (repealed, effective January 1, 2018&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Bruce H. (January 3, 2018). "[https://www.benefitslawadvisor.com/2018/01/articles/tax-cuts-and-jobs-act/2018-tax-reform-series-tax-law-changes-to-employee-fringe-benefits/ 2018 Tax Reform Series: Tax Law Changes to Employee Fringe Benefits]". ''Benefits Law Advisor''. Jackson Lewis P.C.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Fees paid to tax preparers, or to purchase books or software used to determine and calculate taxes owed
* Subscriptions to newspapers or other periodicals directly relating to one's job&lt;ref&gt;Chirelstein, Marvin A., Federal Income Taxation 198 (Foundation Press, 10th Ed., 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==

If the taxpayer's adjusted gross income is above a threshold (or "applicable amount"), then the total allowable itemized deductions is reduced by the lesser of

* 3% of the excess of adjusted gross income over the "applicable amount" (see below); or
* 80% of the total itemized deductions otherwise allowable&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. § 68&lt;/ref&gt;

The "applicable amount" varies according to filing status (see below).

As an example, if an individual filing as "head of household" has one's adjusted gross income is $500,000 and one has $20,000 in itemized deductions, first figure out 3% of the excess above the "applicable amount" (see below):
:&lt;math&gt;.03(500\,000 - 275\,000) = \$6\,750&lt;/math&gt;

Then figure out 80% of the total deductions
:&lt;math&gt;.80(20\,000) = \$16\,000&lt;/math&gt;

Reduce the itemized deduction by the lesser of the above amounts.  In this instance, the lesser value is $6,750.  As such, the taxpayer's total itemized deductions shall be reduced by $6,750, leaving $13,250 of itemized deductions.  
:&lt;math&gt;\$20\,000 - \$6\,750 = \$13\,250&lt;/math&gt;

In addition, this limitation on itemized deductions is applied ''after'' any other limitation.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. § 68(d)&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that you first need to figure out the total allowable miscellaneous itemized deductions, etc., before determining any limits on the total amount of deductions.

'''Applicable Amount.'''  For 2013, the "applicable amount" under § 68(b) of the Tax Code were as follows: 
* $300,000 in the case of married couples filing a joint return or surviving spouse; 
* $150,000 in the case of a married couple filing separately;
* $275,000 in the case of head of household; 
* $250,000 in the case of an unmarried individual who is not a surviving spouse or head of household.
Additionally, after 2013 the applicable threshold amounts are adjusted for inflation.&lt;ref name="Presti&amp;Naegele"&gt;[http://www.prestinaegele.com/how-do-i-calculate-the-reinstated-pease-itemized-deductions-limitation-under-atra Presti&amp;Naegele] How do I calculate the reinstated Pease itemized deductions limitation under ATRA?&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phaseout===
This limitation of itemized deductions has been phased out.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. § 68(f)&lt;/ref&gt;  For taxable years  2006 and 2007, the amount was reduced to 2/3 of the limitation, and for taxable years 2008 and 2009, the amount was reduced to 1/3 of the limitation.  This phase out was completed on January 1, 2010.&lt;ref name="26 U.S.C"/&gt; But in 2010, Congress extended repeal of the itemized deduction limitation through 2012 and in 2011 the repeal was again up for a vote in Congress. Many lawmakers wanted to extend repeal of the itemized deduction limitation for 1-2 more years (or make repeal permanent) but the American Taxpayer Relief Act instead reinstated the itemized deduction limitation for 2013 and subsequent years.&lt;ref name="Presti&amp;Naegele" /&gt;

Due to the international nature of the Internet, [[Internet pornography]] carries with it special issues with regard to the law. There is no one set of laws that apply to the distribution, purchase, or possession of Internet pornography. This means that, for example, even if a pornographer is legally distributing [[pornography]], the person receiving it may not be legally doing so due to local laws.

==Child pornography and the Internet==
{{Main|Child pornography}}

Child pornography is illegal in most countries with coordinated enforcement by [[Interpol]] and policing institutions of various governments, including among others the [[United States Department of Justice]].&lt;ref name=doj1/&gt; Even so, the UK based [[NSPCC]] said that worldwide an estimated 2% of websites still had not been removed a year after being identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/jun/06/internet.childprotection|title=Time taken to shut child abuse sites criticised|author=Bobbie Johnson|work=the Guardian|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent investigations include [[Operation Cathedral]] that resulted in multi-national arrests and 7 convictions as well as uncovering 750,000 images with 1,200 unique identifiable faces being distributed over the web; [[Operation Amethyst]] which occurred in the [[Republic of Ireland]]; [[Operation Auxin]]; [[Operation Avalanche (child pornography crackdown)|Operation Avalanche]]; [[Operation Ore]] based in the [[United Kingdom]]; [[Operation Pin]]; [[Operation Predator]]; the [[2004 Ukrainian child pornography raids]] and the 2008 US child pornography raid. New technology that aids those who produce this material include inexpensive digital cameras and Internet distribution has made it easier than ever before to produce and distribute child pornography. The producers of child pornography try to avoid prosecution by distributing their material across national borders, though this issue is increasingly being addressed with regular arrests of suspects from a number of countries occurring over the last few years.&lt;ref name=doj1&gt;{{cite journal  |author1=Wells, M. |author2=Finkelhor, D. |author3=Wolak, J. |author4=Mitchell, K. | year = 2007  | title = Defining Child Pornography: Law Enforcement Dilemmas in Investigations of Internet Child Pornography Possession  | journal = Police Practice and Research  | volume = 8  | issue = 3  | pages = 269–282 | url =http://www.unh.edu/ccrc/pdf/CV96.pdf  |format=PDF| accessdate = 2008-07-01 |doi=10.1080/15614260701450765}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ncmec&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncmec.org/missingkids/servlet/NewsEventServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&amp;PageId=2064 |title=CHILD PORN AMONG FASTEST GROWING INTERNET BUSINESSES |date=2005-08-05 |accessdate=2008-03-13 |publisher=National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018231331/http://www.ncmec.org/missingkids/servlet/NewsEventServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&amp;PageId=2064 |archivedate=2007-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal status of simulated or "virtual" child pornography varies around the world. Simulated child pornography that do not pass the [[Miller test]] was banned in the [[United States]] in 2003 when the [[PROTECT Act of 2003|PROTECT Act]] was signed,&lt;ref name="strike"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2003/April/03_ag_266.htm|title=#266: 04-30-03 FACT SHEET PROTECT ACT|work=justice.gov|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is illegal in the [[European Union]],&lt;ref name=eko&gt;Eko, L.

With the exception of child pornography, the legal status of accessing Internet pornography is still somewhat unsettled, though many individual states have indicated that the creation and distribution of adult films and photography are legally listed as prostitution within them.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The legality of pornography at the federal level has been traditionally determined by implementing the [[Miller test]]. This test dictates that the opinion of the local community on a specific pornographic piece is most important in determining its legality. Thus, if a local community determines a pornographic work to meet its standard for obscenity then it is more likely to be banned. This means that a pornographic magazine that might be legal in California could be illegal in Alabama. This standard on pornographic legality is extremely difficult to uphold for the internet given that the internet contains ubiquitous amounts of pornography. It has been argued that if the Miller test were applied to the Internet then, in effect, the community standards for the most conservative community would become the standard for all U.S.-based Web sites. The courts are currently examining this issue.

The first attempt to regulate pornography on the Internet was the federal [[Communications Decency Act]] of 1998, which prohibited the "knowing" transmission of "indecent" messages to minors and the publication of materials which depict, in a manner "[[patently offensive]] as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs", unless those materials were protected from access by minors, for example by the use of [[credit card]] systems. Immediately challenged by a group of organizations spearheaded by the [[ACLU]], both of these provisions were struck down by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in [[Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union]] (1997).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.epic.org/cda/cda_decision.html 521 U.S. 844] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050831112442/http://www2.epic.org/cda/cda_decision.html |date=2005-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "indecent transmission" and "patently offensive display" provisions were ruled to limit the [[freedom of speech]] guarantee of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

A second attempt was made with the narrower [[Child Online Protection Act]] (COPA) of 1998, which forced all ''commercial'' distributors of "material harmful to minors" to protect their sites from access by minors. "Material harmful to minors" was defined as materials that by "contemporary community standards" are judged to appeal to the "prurient interest" and that show [[Human sexual activity|sexual acts]] or [[nudity]] (including female breasts). Several [[U.S. state|states]] have since passed similar laws. An injunction blocking the federal government from enforcing COPA was obtained in 1998. In 1999, the [[United States court of appeals|3rd Circuit Court of Appeals]] upheld the injunction and struck down the law, ruling that it was too broad in using "community standards" as part of the definition of harmful materials. In May 2002, the Supreme Court reviewed this ruling, found the lower court’s given reason insufficient and returned the case to the circuit court. In March 2003, the 3rd Circuit Court again struck down the law as unconstitutional, this time arguing that it would hinder protected speech among adults. The administration appealed; in June 2004 the Supreme Court upheld the injunction against the law, ruling that it was most likely unconstitutional but that a lower court should determine whether newer technical developments could affect this question. On March 22, 2007, COPA was found to violate the First and [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] Amendments of the United States Constitution and was struck down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Judge Strikes '98 Law Aimed At Online Porn | agency=Associated Press | url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_5494735 | accessdate=March 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another act intended to protect children from access to Internet pornography is the [[Children's Internet Protection Act]] (CIPA) of 2000. It requires that public libraries, as a condition of receiving federal subsidies for Internet connectivity, employ [[censorware|filtering software]] to prevent patrons from using Internet terminals to view images of [[obscenity]] and [[child pornography]], and to prevent children from viewing images "harmful to minors", a phrase encompassing pornography that has been held by the Supreme Court to be protected by the First Amendment for adults. The act allows librarians to disable the filtering software for adult patrons with "bona-fide research or other lawful purposes". The act was challenged by the [[American Library Association]] on First Amendment grounds, and enforcement of the act was blocked by a lower court. In June 2003, the Supreme Court reversed and ruled that the act was constitutional and could go into effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlinepolicy.org/action/20030623.ussupremecourt.cipalibrarydecision.02-361.pdf ''U.S. v. American Library Association, No. 02-361, 2003'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of sexually explicit materials is regulated under [[18 U.S.C. 2257]], requiring "original" producers to retain records showing that all performers were over the age of 18 at the time of the production for inspection by the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]]. The 18 U.S.C. 2257 disclaimer is common on Internet sites distributing pornography, but the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] has rarely if ever enforced the provision. Although the law had been on the books for over 10 years, the Justice Department never actually inspected anyone. It was not until pressure from Congress, and conservative religious groups spurred the [[George W. Bush administration|administration of George W. Bush]] and [[Alberto Gonzales|Attorney General Gonzales]] to begin inspections of larger commercial pornography companies primarily in the Los Angeles area. Despite fearing mass inspections, harassment, and prosecution, the Justice Department inspected less than two dozen companies (out of several thousand operating), and no prosecutions resulted from any of the inspections. Retired FBI agents conducted the inspections, and generally arrived with a list of videos whose records they wanted to examine (most likely, to avoid potential Fourth Amendment conflicts on issues of probable cause).  According to pornography executives, the agents were always courteous and professional, suggesting changes or modifications to the companies' record-keeping processes.  Once Attorney General Alberto Gonzales left the Justice Department, the inspections ended.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In 2005, the Department of Justice issued regulations that expand the definition of a "secondary producer" of sexually explicit material. As of June 23, 2005, federal regulations apply the 2257 record-keeping requirement to secondary producers, and defines them as including anyone who "inserts on a computer site or service a digital image of, or otherwise manages the sexually explicit content of a computer site or service that contains a visual depiction of, an actual human being engaged in actual or simulated sexually explicit conduct." 73 Fed.

On October 24, 2007, the [[Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals]] in Ohio issued a judgment against the 2257 law, ruling it as unconstitutional according to the First Amendment. However, the Sixth Circuit subsequently reheard the case ''[[en banc]]'' and issued an opinion on February 20, 2009, upholding the constitutionality of the record-keeping requirements, albeit with some dissents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/09a0063p-06.pdf Connection Distributing Co. v. Holder, (6th Cir. 2009) (''en banc'').]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sixth Circuit en banc decision was appealed to the US Supreme Court where on Monday October 5, 2009, the US Supreme Court denied [[certiorari]] without comment not addressing the Sixth Circuit decision that 18 USC 2257 is not constitutionally "vague and overbroad" and able to be enforced. See the one line denial on page nine of the Supreme Court order list for October 5, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/100509zor.pdf Connection Distributing Co. v. Holder, (Supreme Court list of orders)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2001, Buffnet, a New York [[Internet Service Provider]], pleaded guilty in state court to a misdemeanor count of knowingly providing access to child pornography, after being notified by police of the content and not taking action.  The ISP faced a $5000 fine.&lt;ref name="Wired.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2001/02/41878 |title=ISP Guilty in Child Porn Case |publisher=Wired.com |accessdate=December 11, 2010 |date=February 16, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Pornography in the United Kingdom}}
The sale or distribution of [[hardcore pornography]] through any channel was prohibited until the rules were relaxed in 2002. However, pornographic videos sold or distributed legally within the UK must receive a certificate from the [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC) and the rules are still quite strict.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In 1996, internet service providers started the [[Internet Watch Foundation]] to watch for pornographic content that is in violation of British law and report it to the police. The web filter [[Cleanfeed (content blocking system)|Cleanfeed]] is used by the largest ISP, [[BT Group]], to block sites on the Internet Watch Foundation's list, which include sites that are "criminally [[obscenity|obscene]]" as well as [[child pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwf.org.uk/public/page.103.htm |title=About Us |publisher=[[Internet Watch Foundation]] |accessdate=14 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305141516/http://www.iwf.org.uk/public/page.103.htm |archivedate=5 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government ordered all ISPs to have a Cleanfeed-like system by the end of 2007.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The possession of pornographic images for private use has traditionally not been an offence in the UK. This means that UK citizens have been able to access content on sites overseas without breaking any laws, except for [[child pornography]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} However, adult pornography that falls under the Government's classification of "[[Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008|extreme pornography]]" became illegal to possess as of January 26, 2009, carrying a three-year prison sentence. This was proposed by the Government after the [[murder of Jane Longhurst]], claiming that such material was viewed by murderer Graham Coutts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4195332.stm |title=Ban on violent net porn planned |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=August 30, 2005 |accessdate=March 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/berkshire/5297600.stm |title=Mother wins ban on violent porn |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=August 30, 2006 |accessdate=March 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the law have pointed out that it criminalises images of legal acts between consenting adults&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6237226.stm |title='Extreme' porn proposals spark row |first=Chris |last=Summers |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=July 4, 2007 |accessdate=May 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7364475.stm |title=When does kinky porn become illegal? |first=Chris |last=Summers |work=[[BBC News Magazine]] |date=April 29, 2008 |accessdate=May 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and have criticised the lack of evidence of a link between viewing such material, and violent crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.backlash-uk.org.uk/acad_statement.html |title=Statement to the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill Committee |publisher=backlash |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220215632/http://www.backlash-uk.org.uk/acad_statement.html |archivedate=December 20, 2008 |date=2007 |accessdate=November 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] introduced plans to filter internet pornography by default in the UK. By the end of 2014, access to internet pornography was blocked unless subscribers specifically chose to 'opt out' by contacting their [[ISP]]. This was done in an effort to reduce the number of children having access to pornography on the Internet. The plans were criticised as likely to sweep up non-pornographic content, disclose intimate information to the government, and as unwarranted censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/07/22/seeks-automatic-blocks-online-porn/bBmAJ8KElAophEAwYu6LqJ/story.html |title=UK seeks automatic blocks on online porn |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=July 23, 2013 |accessdate=August 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, the jurisdiction of the BBFC was extended with the [[Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014]] to include pornography available over video on demand and streaming platforms, effectively aligning internet pornography laws with the [[Video Recordings Act 1984]]. This brought a renewed controversy over the banning of depiction of certain sex acts including depictions "physical or verbal abuse", "roleplay as non-adults", [[urolagnia]], and [[female ejaculation]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/a-long-list-of-sex-acts-just-got-banned-in-uk-porn-9897174.html |title=A long list of sex acts just got banned in UK porn |first=Christopher |last=Hooton |work=[[The Independent]] |date=December 2, 2014 |accessdate=March 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Digital Economy Act 2017]] includes powers to require age-verification for pornographic Internet sites and the government accepted an amendment to allow the regulator to require ISPs to block access to non-compliant sites.&lt;ref name="Ars 2016-11-24"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/11/isps-block-porn-sites-age-verification-digital-economy-bill/ |title=UK ISPs may be forced to block porn sites that snub age checks, sex acts face ban |first=Kelly |last=Fiveash |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=November 24, 2016 |accessdate=November 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the BBFC have been appointed as the regulator, this has caused discussion about ISPs being required to block content that is prohibited even under an [[R18 (British Board of Film Classification)|R18 certificate]],&lt;ref name="Ars 2016-11-24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian 2016-11-23"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/23/censor-non-conventional-sex-acts-online-internet-pornography |title=UK to censor online videos of 'non-conventional' sex acts |first=Damien |last=Gayle |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=November 23, 2016 |accessdate=November 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the prohibition of some of which is itself controversial.&lt;ref name="Guardian 2016-11-23"/&gt;

=== Australia ===
{{update|section|date=April 2014}}
Internet pornography in [[Australia]] is subject to a multifaceted regulatory framework. Criminal legislation is in force at the Commonwealth, state and territory levels targeting those involved in the production, dissemination and consumption of illegal internet pornography (including [[online child abuse]] pornography and online pornography featuring adults portrayed as children).

It is illegal for internet content providers within Australia to 'broadcast' internet pornography classified as MA15+ to R18+ unless such internet pornography is subject to an age verification system or internet pornography which may be classified as X18+ to RC content that is not subject to an [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] (ACMA) infringement notice through exceptions.

Under an internet filter, proposed by Senator [[Stephen Conroy]], internet pornography hosted outside Australia classified by the ACMA under the Classification Board legislation will be blocked if such internet pornography is deemed by the AMCA to be refused classification (RC), or 'potentially' refused classification. Refused classification (RC) does include real child abuse internet pornography and bestiality internet pornography, however it may also include content discussing or illustrating examples of internet pornography (including both, illegal internet pornography and internet pornography featuring adults portrayed as children) which may limit discussion and debate to authorised statutory persons only, rather than open and free public debate.

Criminal legislation is complemented by a further tier of regulation which provides a range of administrative remedies designed to deal with the availability of inappropriate content by removing it from the internet or by blocking access to it.

'''Online content scheme'''

Since January 1999, internet pornography considered offensive or illegal has been subject to a statutory scheme administered by ACMA as Australia’s media regulator.

Established under Schedule 5 to the ''[[Broadcasting Services Act 1992]]'', the online content scheme evolved from a tradition of Australian content regulation in broadcasting and other entertainment media.  This tradition embodies the principle that – while adults should be free to see, hear and read what they want – children should be protected from material that may be unsuitable for (or harmful to) them, and everyone should be protected from material that is highly offensive.

The online content scheme seeks to achieve these objectives by a number of means such as complaint investigation processes, government and industry collaboration, and community awareness and empowerment.  While administration of the scheme is the responsibility of ACMA, the principle of ‘co-regulation’ underpinning the scheme reflects parliament’s intention that government, industry and the community each plays a role in managing internet safety issues in Australia.

'''Investigations into internet pornography'''

A central feature of the online content scheme is the complaints mechanism that allows members of the Australian public to submit complaints to ACMA about offensive and illegal internet content.

Offensive and illegal internet content will be ‘prohibited’ under the scheme if it meets certain classification thresholds, irrespective of where the content is hosted.  If prohibited content is hosted in Australia, ACMA will direct the internet content host to remove the content from its service.  If prohibited content is not hosted in Australia, ACMA will notify the content to the suppliers of accredited filters in accordance with the Internet Industry Association's internet content code of practice so that access to that content is blocked for users of those filters.

In addition, sufficiently serious internet content (for example, illegal material such as child pornography) will be referred by ACMA under specialized agreements to the appropriate law enforcement agency, or, where appropriate, to a fellow member of the Internet Hotline Providers’ Association (INHOPE).

Between January 2000 and June 2006, ACMA received over 5,000 complaints from the public about offensive and illegal internet content hosted in Australia and overseas, resulting in the removal or blocking of almost 4,000 individual items of online content.  Approximately 60% of such content was also referred to law enforcement agencies on the basis that it related to material classifiable as ‘RC’ (see below).

'''Classification of internet pornography'''

Internet pornography will be ‘prohibited’ by ACMA if certain classification thresholds are met.  These thresholds form part of the National Classification Scheme (which also applies to other forms of media such as publications, films and video games) and are agreed by the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth, States and Territories.

The thresholds are articulated in a National Classification Code and in Guidelines.  The Classification Board (part of the Attorney-General’s Department) is Australia’s official classification body.  In the course of investigating potentially prohibited internet content, ACMA may seek a formal classification decision from the Classification Board, or it may make its own assessment of the content against the National Classification Code and in Guidelines.

In summary, the following categories of internet content are prohibited:
•	Content classifiable as ‘RC’ (‘refused classification’). Such content includes, for example, illegal material (such as [[child sexual abuse material]]) and other highly offensive material (such as bestiality).
•	Content classifiable as ‘X18+’. Such content includes material containing real depictions of actual sexual activity.
•	Content hosted in Australia which is classified ‘R18+’ and not subject to a restricted access system which complies with criteria determined by ACMA. Content classified R18+ is not considered suitable for minors.  Such content includes, for example, material containing implied (or simulated) sexual activity.

Internet pornography will be prohibited if it falls within the ‘RC’ or ‘X18+’ classifications or, for content hosted in Australia that is not restricted by an adult verification procedure, if it falls within the ‘R18+’ classification.

'''Victorian legislation'''

In Victoria, the law states that child pornography ‘means a film, photograph, publication or computer game that describes or depicts a person who is, or who looks like, a minor under 18 engaging in sexual activity or depicted in an indecent manner or context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ca195882/s67a.html|title=CRIMES ACT 1958 - SECT 67A - Definitions|author=|date=|work=austlii.edu.au|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this law, ‘publications’ also include stories, poems, essays, drawings and cartoons.

=== Finland ===
Finnish law specifically prohibits either real or realistic imagery which sexually depicts children. The illegality thus discludes non-realistic imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2011/20110540|title=Laki rikoslain muuttamisesta|author=|date=|language=fi|work=finlex.fi|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indonesia ===
The legal situation in [[Indonesia]] tightened sharply in 2008 with the passing of the [[Bill against Pornography and Pornoaction]].  Law books of Indonesia KUHP (Kitab Undang-Undang Hukum Pidana) article number 282 says that "it is forbidden to spread pornographic content".  But there have been Indonesian pornographic pay sites with Indonesian nude models that exploit legal loopholes.

=== Hong Kong ===
Pursuant to the Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance (Cap 390), it is an offence to publish an obscene article. Publication covers distribution, circulation, selling, hiring, giving, or lending the obscene article. Distribution by email would fall within the definition of distribution, as would the placing of an obscene article on a web site. It should also be noted that distribution does not require any element of financial gain to be present. The definition of article includes "anything consisting of or containing material to be read or looked at or both read and looked at, any sound recording, and any film, video-tape, disc or other record of a picture or pictures." The article will be considered obscene if, by reason by its obscenity, "it is not suitable to be published by any person." Obscenity includes "violence, depravity and repulsiveness". The penalty for this offence is up to three years imprisonment and a fine of up to HK$1,000,000.

Related cases (see [[Edison Chen photo scandal]]):
* On January 27, 2008, The [[Hong Kong]] Police Force arrested suspects who were accused of uploading pornographic images after a multi-billion entertainment company filed a complaint about these photos available on the internet having been fabricated and might charge the offender for defamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/articles/2009/05/13/1241894033965.html|title=Tech jailed for stealing sex-with-starlet photos|author=|date=13 May 2009|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the Prevention of Child Pornography Ordinance, Cap.579, was enacted to deal with the problems associated with child pornography in Hong Kong.  Under Section 3, dealing in any of the following manners with child pornography, such as “prints, makes, produces, reproduces, copies, imports or exports”; “publishes” or “ has in his possession” is an offence.
A child is a person under the age of 16. “Child pornography” means a photograph, film, computer-generated image or other visual depiction that is a pornographic depiction of a  child. “Pornographic depiction” means a visual depiction that depicts a person as being engaged in explicit sexual conduct, whether or not the person is in fact engaged in such conduct; or a visual depiction that depicts, in a sexual manner or context, the genitals or anal region of a person or the breast of a female person. In Hong Kong, recent data shows that $14k is funded towards [[hentai]]/pornography companies. Producers are beginning to believe this is "A special skill and talent" or in other words, a paying job.

=== Gaza Strip ===
[[Hamas]] authorities of the [[Gaza Strip]] began blocking Internet pornography sites in late May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1920867720080519 Hamas bans pornographic websites in Gaza Strip].

===Malaysia===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
A limited number of pornographic websites are accessible in Malaysia, with blocks and government monitoring. The national government continues to block many porn websites, it has blocked over 3,000 sites as of 2018.

In July 2018, the Malaysian police announced the creation of the Malaysian Internet Crime Against Children Investigation Unit (MICAC) that is equipped with real-time mass internet surveillance software developed in the United States and is tasked with the monitoring of all Malaysian Internet users even on mobile phones, with a focus on pornography and child pornography. The system creates a "data library" of users which includes details such as IP addresses, websites, locations, duration and frequency of use and files uploaded and downloaded. Visiting these websites are subject to either questioning by police or imprisonment.

===Philippines===

Since January 14, 2017, several pornography sites including Pornhub and XVideos has been blocked in the Philippines by President Rodrigo Duterte as part of the Republic Act 9775 or the Anti-Child Pornography Law, but still can be accessed depending on the ISP.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

=== Russia ===
[[Roskomnadzor]], the Russian government's media overseer, has the power to order the blocking of pornographic websites. In 2015, the agency ordered the blocking of the Russian-language version of [[Pornhub]] and 10 other pornographic sites on the basis of a court ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia Blocks Access to Popular Porn Sites|url=http://www.tol.org/client/article/26316-russia-pornhub-roskomnadzor-blacklist-media.html|date=15 September 2016|work=Transitions Online|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2015, the Roskomnadzor has blocked over 100 pornography sites, making it difficult to view in Russia. Two more websites [[PornHub]] and [[YouPorn]]  were blocked in Russia in September 2016. [[PornHub]] was unblocked in 2017.

===Singapore===
The [[Media Development Authority]], a government-run agency in [[Singapore]], [[Internet censorship in Singapore|blocks]]  a "symbolic"&lt;ref name="symbol"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSS2322899620080523 | work=Reuters | title=Singapore bans two porn websites in symbolic move | first=Melanie | last=Lee | date=May 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; number of websites containing "mass impact objectionable"&lt;ref name="symbol"/&gt; material, including [[Playboy]], and [[Sex.com]].  In addition, the Ministry of Education, Singapore blocks access to pornographic websites.

===South Africa===
Since 2007, it is illegal to host a pornographic website in South Africa. However, accessing international porn websites is not an offence. {{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Thailand===
A few pornographic websites are accessible in Thailand, mostly foreign, as long it's for personal use. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Ukraine===
Pornography has become illegal in Ukraine since 2009, however the Internet porn websites are still accessible. No laws has been enforced yet. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24660">In [[cable television]], governments apply a '''must-carry''' regulation stating that locally licensed [[television station]]s must be carried on a cable provider's system.

== North America ==
=== Canada ===
{{see also|9(1)(h) order}}
Under current  [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] rules, the lowest tier of service on all Canadian television providers may not be priced higher than $25 per-month, and must include all local Canadian broadcast television channels, local legislative and educational services, and all specialty services that have [[9(1)(h) order|9(1)(h) must-carry status]].&lt;ref name=cbc-crtc2016rules&gt;{{cite news|title=CRTC rules cable companies must offer pick-and-pay channels, $25 basic package|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/crtc-rules-cable-companies-must-offer-pick-and-pay-channels-25-basic-package-1.3001370|accessdate=19 March 2015|work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-to-late 1970s, the CRTC implemented a rule that a cable system must carry a broadcast television station at no cost to the broadcaster so long as the transmitter emitted an [[equivalent isotropically radiated power]] of at least 5 watts. This CRTC rule may have changed over the years, but in principle, a broadcast television station transmitting at 1&amp;nbsp;kW EIRP must be carried. The status of terrestrial ''digital only'' channels with respect to the must-carry requirement is untested as, unlike the U.S., some television stations in [[Canada]] did not operate [[digital television|digital signals]] until the [[Digital television transition in Canada|August 2011]] and the digital broadcasters that were active prior to then were merely [[high-definition television|high definition]] simulcasts of those stations' existing analog signals in major centres such as [[Toronto]] and [[Vancouver]] with no additional [[digital subchannel]]s offered due to broadcasters opting not to carry any due to CRTC rules that require subchannels to be licensed separately.

[[CITY-DT|CITY-TV]] in Toronto (according to its own website and annual reports) owes its financial success as an [[independent station (North America)|independent station]] to this CRTC must-carry rule. It is assumed that this must-carry rule was aimed at smaller television stations in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], many of which are not carried by [[satellite television]] providers.

For many years, the Canadian must-carry rules created very little friction between terrestrial broadcasters and cable systems, as providers are allowed to more aggressively implement other digital telecommunications services (like cable internet services and IP telephony) with less overall regulation than their U.S. counterparts. However, in 2008, Canada's two largest commercial television networks, [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and [[Global Television Network|Global]], began to demand that the CRTC permit them to charge a [[fee-for-carriage|fee for cable carriage]], even alleging that some smaller market stations would be forced to cease operations if this was not allowed.

=== United States ===
In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) [[regulation|regulates]] this area of business and public policy pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Part II.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/chapter-5/subchapter-V-A/part-II 47 USC § 531 - § 537] for relevant sections of the [[Communications Act of 1934]], and FCC regulations promulgated pursuant to the Act at [http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2007/octqtr/pdf/47cfr76.56.pdf  47 CFR 76.56: Signal carriage obligations]&lt;/ref&gt; These rules were upheld in a 5-4 decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1997 in the case ''[[Turner Broadcasting v. FCC]]'' (95-992).

Although cable television service providers routinely carried [[Network affiliate|local affiliates]] of the major broadcast networks, independent stations and affiliates of minor networks were sometimes not carried, on the premise it would allow cable providers to instead carry non-[[local programming]] which they believed would attract more customers to their service.

Many cable operators were also equity owners in these [[cable channel]]s, especially [[Tele-Communications Inc.]], then the nation's largest [[multiple system operator]] (MSO), and had moved to replace local channels with equity-owned programming (at the time, TCI held a large stake in [[Discovery Communications]]). This pressure was especially strong on cable systems with limited [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] for channels.

The smaller local broadcasters argued that by hampering their access to this increasing segment of the local television audience, this posed a threat to the viability of free-to-view broadcast television, which they argued was a worthy [[public good]].

Local broadcast stations also argued cable systems were attempting to serve as a "[[gatekeeper]]" in competing unfairly for advertising revenue. Some affiliates of major networks also feared that non-local affiliates might negotiate to provide [[television program]]ming to local cable services to expand their advertising market, taking away this audience from local stations, with similar adverse impact on free broadcast television.

Although cable providers argued that such regulation would impose an undue burden on their flexibility in selecting which services would be most appealing to their customers, the current "must-carry" rules were enacted by the [[United States Congress]] in 1992 (via the [[Cable Television Protection and Competition Act]]), and the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] upheld the rules in rejecting the arguments of the cable industry and programmers in the majority decision authored by Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]]. That decision also held that MSOs were functioning as a [[vertically integrated]] monopoly.

A side effect of the must-carry rules is that a broadcast station cannot charge a cable television provider license fees for the program content retransmitted on the cable network under the rule.  But note that must-carry is an option of the station and the station may, in lieu of must-carry, negotiate license fees as part of a [[retransmission consent]] agreement.

==== Applicability ====
There are a few exceptions to must-carry, most notably:
* Must-carry is the default assumption even if a station does not make a formal request [see US Code Title 47, Section 76.64(f)3 ]. 
* Must-carry may be applied only if the [[television station]] does not want to be carried under the retransmission consent provisions. This applies only to [[non-commercial educational]] (NCE) stations. Station operators are allowed to demand payment from cable operators, or negotiate private agreements for carriage, or threaten revocation against the cable operator (see [[Sinclair Broadcast Group#Retransmission disputes|Sinclair]], [[Time Warner Cable#Carriage controversies|Time Warner Cable]]). Must-carry is a privilege given to television stations, not a cable company. A cable company cannot use must-carry to demand the right to carry an [[Over-the-air programming|over-the-air]] station against the station's wishes.
* A station is not entitled to distribution under must-carry legislation until a certain time after it provides usable signal to the [[Cable television headend|headend]] for the cable or satellite provider; the station must pay the expense of leased lines to reach providers such as [[Denver|Colorado]]-based [[Dish Network]] or [[El Segundo, California|California]]-based [[DirecTV]].
* Foreign signals, such as [[Windsor, Ontario]] stations [[CBET-DT]] and [[TVOntario|CICO]], or [[McAllen, Texas]]'s CW affiliate ([[XHRIO-TV]]), are not required to be carried, but are often carried on border-area cable systems close to the foreign stations.
* Most [[low-power broadcasting|low-power broadcast]] stations are not required to be carried, although often in these cases they are bundled to be carried as part of a [[retransmission consent]] agreement with a full-power sister station.

==== Digital must-carry ====
Digital must-carry (also incorrectly called "dual must-carry") is the requirement that cable companies carry either the [[analog (signal)|analog]] (over a hybrid analog/digital cable system) or [[Digital data|digital]] (over a digital-only pay television system like [[AT&amp;T U-verse]] or [[Verizon FiOS]]) signal. They must still meet the every-subscriber/television receiver laws, i.e. "Pursuant to Section 614(b)(7) and 615(h), the operator of a cable system is required to ensure that signals carried in fulfillment of the must-carry requirements are provided to EVERY subscriber of the system," of local stations. This has been opposed by numerous [[cable network]]s, which might be bumped off of [[digital cable]] were this to happen, and promoted by television stations and the [[National Association of Broadcasters]], whom it would benefit by passing their [[High-definition television|high definition]] or digital multicast signals through to their cable viewers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} In June 2006, the FCC was poised to pass new digital must-carry rules, but the item was pulled before a vote actually took place, apparently due to insufficient support for the chairman's position.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

In September 2007, the Commission approved a regulation that requires cable systems to carry the analog signals if the cable system uses both types of transmission. The FCC left the decision to also retransmit the digital signal up to the cable provider. Digital-only operators are not required to provide an analog signal for their customers (AT&amp;T U-verse, Verizon FiOS). Small cable operators were allowed to request a waiver. The regulation ended three years after the date of the [[Digital television transition in the United States|digital television transition]] (which occurred on June 12, 2009), and applies only to stations not opting for retransmission consent.

Cable operators (analog and digital) that transmit more than 12 channels need only provide a maximum 1/3 of their total channel size to this must-carry requirement. Thus with about 150 channels available to a 1&amp;nbsp;GHz operator, they are only required to support up to 50 analog channels (42 for 850&amp;nbsp;MHz, 36 for 750&amp;nbsp;MHz). Cable providers that decide to scale back their analog selection merely need provide written notification on their bill (or equivalent) for 30 days prior to their change. Customers already using digital cable set-top boxes will usually be unaffected (if anything after the change, they may get a large number of additional channels because each analog channel can be replaced by 2-51 digital channels). The requirement only applies to must-carry stations; most metro providers carry many more analog stations by choice, not law.

==== Other networks ====
A variation of "must-carry" also applies to [[Direct broadcast satellite|DBS]] services like DirecTV and Dish Network, as first mandated by the [[Satellite Home Viewer Act]]. These providers are not required to carry local stations in ''every'' [[metropolitan area]] in which they provide service, but must carry ''all'' of an area's local stations if they carry any at all. Sometimes, these will be placed on [[spot beam]]s: narrowly directed satellite signals targeted to an area of no more than a few hundred miles diameter, in order to allow the transponder frequencies to be re-used in other [[media market|markets]]. In some cases, stations of lower perceived importance are placed on "side satellites" which require a second antenna. This practice has raised some controversy within the industry, leading to the requirement that the satellite provider offer to install any extra dish antenna hardware for free and place a notice to this effect in place of any missing channels.

==== Retransmission consent ====
{{main|Retransmission consent}}
If a broadcaster elects [[retransmission consent]], there is no obligation for the cable system to carry the signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2007/octqtr/pdf/47cfr76.64.pdf|title=47CFR76.64: Retransmission consent|author=|date=|website=gpo.gov|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This option allows broadcasters who own stations, including those affiliated with major networks such as [[CBS]], [[NBC]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] or [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] to request cash or other compensation from cable or satellite providers for signals. These networks have usually attempted to gain further distribution of cable services and/or co-owned [[low-power broadcasting|low-power television]] stations in which they also hold an equity position rather than direct cash compensation, which cable systems have almost universally balked at paying. In some cases, these channels have been [[carriage dispute|temporarily removed from distribution by systems]] who felt broadcasters were asking too steep a [[price]] for their signal. Examples include the removal of all CBS-owned local stations as well as [[MTV]], [[VH1]] and [[Nickelodeon]] from [[Dish Network]] for two days in 2004, the removal of ABC-owned stations from [[Time Warner Cable]] for a little under a day in 2000, and the removal of all [[Hearst Television]] local stations from Time Warner for more than a week in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://networkedblogs.com/zJMOu Tampa Bay Times: "Hearst dispute with Bright House pulls WMOR-Ch. 32 and digital THIS TV off Tampa Bay cable system", July 10, 2012.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214111136/http://networkedblogs.com/zJMOu |date=December 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, [[Time Warner Cable]] and [[CBS Corporation]] reached an impasse in negotiations over retransmission fees, forcing a one-month blackout of CBS-owned broadcast and cable networks similar to the 2004 Dish Network blackout. It was the longest such blackout to date, and has produced calls for Congress to revisit the issue of retransmission consent. TWC had offered affected customers a $20 credit on their bill for the inconvenience, but the blackout caused at least one class-action lawsuit against the cable operator, and others are pending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cbs-time-warner-cable-reach-619367|title=CBS, Time Warner Cable Reach Carriage Deal|author=|date=|website=hollywoodreporter.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., retransmission consent has often been chosen over must-carry by the major commercial television networks.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} Under the present rules, a new agreement is negotiated every three years, and stations must choose must-carry or retransmission consent for each cable system they wish their signal to be carried on. Non-commercial stations (such as local PBS stations) may not seek retransmission consent and may only invoke must-carry status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/guides/cable-carriage-broadcast-stations|title=Cable Carriage of Broadcast Stations|author=|date=9 December 2015|website=fcc.gov|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico ===

{{see also|Federal Telecommunications Institute}}

Before 2013, there was no regulation on the obligation to offer national network signals in pay TV companies. The scheme used consisted of allowing free negotiation between the operators of open television and restricted television. Open-TV companies (Televisa and TV Azteca) had been negotiating with pay-TV companies to offer their television signals on national networks. However, the national network channels were offered together, and without option, alongside restricted TV channels. In addition, regional and local channels were not broadcast on restricted TV companies except individual agreements. This caused that few companies had the same channels in all the cities where they operated. This mechanism was designed considering that, in the event of anti-competitive situations, the competent authority would intervene to correct and punish anticompetitive misconduct and conduct.

On March 22, 2013, the Mexican government announced a series of reforms to Mexican television broadcasting laws. The constitutional reform incorporated the must-carry and must-offer figures, consisting of the obligation of "Paid television" providers to retransmit the "Open TV" (Free-to-air channels) signals and the latter, to make available such signal, free of charge.

==== Applicability ====

According to Telecommunications and Broadcasting Federal Law (in Spanish, "Ley Federal de Telecomunicaciones y Radiodifusión"), this is the list of restrictions and rules about must-carry; being the next:

* [[Las Estrellas|Las Estrellas]], [[Canal 5 (Mexico)|Channel 5]], [[Azteca 7]] and [[Azteca 13]] had their own national coverage beyond 50%; so the channel signals must be carry without conditions or restrictions.
* The elements declared preponderant economic agent will not be able to accede to the rule of gratuitousness; and they will not even be able to recover it as an additional cost.
* In the scenario where there are two channels of the same television signal, it must be transmitted the most favorable to the population where it transmits.
* The restricted Television Dealers must block content from live public events that are not broadcast by the Open-TV enterprise.
* The retransmission of the broadcast signals shall be made to the highest possible quality and may not be advertised in such a way as to generate a false and artificial advantage in the signals.
* The channels that are broadcast by [[Media multitasking|multitasking]] must be also carry and offer, considering the most-view channels.
* The Free-charge and agreement would end when there were conditions of competition in restricted television; which would renegotiate the price. The institute would determine the price if there was no consensus between involved parts.
* The elements declared preponderant economic agent will not be able to accede to broadcast more than 50% of the broadcast channels in the city where are assigned.
* The payment for royalties of copyright on television channels should not involve additional costs for pay-TV consumers.
* The open television signals to be retransmitted are placed together in the pay television services at the beginning of the programming channel alignment. Pay television companies must accommodate the channels respecting the order and numerical identity in terms of the allocation of broadcast television virtual channels. 
* The Pay television companies must to order in the referred form the broadcast signals of stations that have not obtained authorization to multiprogram, As well as multiprogrammed broadcast signals with a larger audience, regardless of the secondary number with which they count.

==== Reactions and conflicts ====

This new law provoked complaints from television companies [[TV Azteca]] and [[Televisa]], who argued [[copyright]] infringement and royalties for the transmission of channels. In addition, Televisa requested a right of amparo to declare that the Institute did not have constitutional power to decide on the television channels. This controversy was solved when the President of Mexico announced the filing of a constitutional controversy before the Supreme Court, to reaffirm the regulatory powers of the Institute; Which gave him legal and judicial power to make decisions on the matter.

The same Telecommunications and Broadcasting Federal Law (in Spanish, "Ley Federal de Telecomunicaciones y Radiodifusión") also declared every TV Channel broadcast in the zone must be offered by the Cable TV enterprises, according to the city or state where works in free of charge.

== Europe ==
=== Czech Republic ===
In the [[Czech Republic]], all television stations that have a terrestrial licence (analog or digital) are required to be placed in the lowest (cheapest) offer of all cable, IPTV and satellite companies.

Must-carry regulations are applied to:
* All channels of [[Česká televize|Czech Television]] - [[ČT1]], [[ČT2]], [[ČT24]] and [[ČT4]] (sport)
* All channels of [[TV Prima]] - [[TV Prima|Prima]], [[Prima Cool]] and [[TV R1|R1 TV]]
* Two of three channels of [[Nova (Czech TV)|TV Nova]] - [[Nova (Czech TV)|Nova]] and [[Nova Cinema (Czech TV)|Nova Cinema]]
* New digital television stations - [[TV Barrandov]] and [[Z1 TV|Z1]]
* Future television stations TV7 (regional news) and RTA (regional television)
* Carriage of TV Pohoda and Febio TV was also mandated by must-carry regulations; however, as investments for these channels were pulled, these channels never commenced broadcasting.

=== Ireland ===
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], cable, [[multichannel multipoint distribution service]]s and satellite providers have [[Comreg]] regulated "must-carry" stations. For cable companies, this covers [[RTÉ One]], [[RTÉ Two]], [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] and [[TG4]].

The same rules apply to digital MMDS systems. Analogue MMDS companies are required to carry only TV3 due to serious bandwidth limitations.

*Local broadcaster (when available)

== Asia ==
=== India ===
The [[India]]n government has applied a must-carry rule for public broadcaster channels from [[Doordarshan]] by Cable, DTH and IPTV network. Cable TV operators must offer National (DD1), DD News, Loksabha, Rajyasabha and Regional channels to all subscribers. In addition, DD Bharti and DD Urdu must also be carried in their appropriate tiers.

The National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) requires pay-TV operators to carry licensed free-to-air stations on their all their packages.  The rule particularly forbids pay-TV operators from excluding such stations to places which ordinarily cannot receive a decent broadcast signal.&lt;ref name="NTC"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the so-called "Must-Carry Rule"?|url=https://www.batasnatin.com/law-library/mercantile-law/transportation-laws/2223-must-carry-rule.html|website=BATASnatin Philippine Law Library|publisher=Libayan &amp; Associates|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Thailand]], all terrestrial television channels are required to be carried on satellite and cable television platform as free-to-air channels and required to be placed on same EPG number as terrestrial platform. Must-carry rule was applied to the analog terrestrial television channels and was dropped in 2014 replacing by digital terrestrial television channels. Thailand's National Broadcasting and Telecommunication Commission (NBTC) said the must-carry rule will be used to guarantee Thais' basic right to watch free-TV programs via any platform such as antennas and cable and satellite receivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Must-carry rule will not threaten copyrights: NBTC - The Nation|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/business/Must-carry-rule-will-not-threaten-copyrights-NBTC-30186838.html|publisher=Nation Multimedia Group Public Company Limited, Nationmultimedia.com,|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9054">The '''Office of Alien Property Custodian''' was an office within the Government of the [[United States]] during [[World War I]] and again during [[World War II]], serving as a [[Custodian of Enemy Property]] to property that belonged to US enemies.

==World War I==
[[File:Wilson-palmer-c1918.jpg|right|thumb|President Wilson with Mitchell Palmer, the first Alien Property Custodian]]
President [[Woodrow Wilson]] appointed [[A. Mitchell Palmer]], a political ally and former Congressman, Alien Property Custodian in October 1917. Palmer held the position from October 22, 1917, until March 4, 1919. A wartime agency, the Custodian had responsibility for the seizure, administration, and sometimes the sale of enemy property in the United States. Under the [[Trading with the Enemy Act]], Palmer was allowed to take control of property that might hinder the war effort, including all property belonging to interned immigrants, whether they had been charged with a crime or not.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gross|first1=Daniel A.|title=Chemical Warfare: From the European Battlefield to the American Laboratory|journal=Distillations|date=Spring 2015|volume=1|issue=1|pages=16–23|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/chemical-warfare-from-the-european-battlefield-to-the-american-laboratory|accessdate=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer's background in law and banking qualified him for the position, along with his party loyalty and intimate knowledge of political patronage.&lt;ref name="Coben"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coben|first1=Stanley|title=A. Mitchell Palmer: Politician|date=1963|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|128}} Under Palmer's leadership, the Office of the Alien Property Custodian employed hundreds of officials.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gross|first1=Daniel A.|title=The U.S. Confiscated Half a Billion Dollars in Private Property During WWI: America's home front was the site of internment, deportation, and vast property seizure|journal=Smithsonian|date=28 July 2014|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/us-confiscated-half-billion-dollars-private-property-during-wwi-180952144/|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of the assets the Custodian controlled only became clear over the next year. Late in 1918, Palmer reported he was managing almost 30,000 trusts with assets worth half a billion dollars. He estimated that another 9,000 trusts worth $300,000,000 dollars awaited evaluation. Many of the enterprises in question produced materials significant to the war effort, such as medicines, [[glycerin]] for explosives, [[Activated carbon|charcoal]] for gas masks. Others included mines, brewing, and newspaper publishing. Palmer built a team of professionals with banking expertise as well as an investigative bureau to track down well-hidden assets. Below the top-level positions, he distributed jobs as [[patronage]]. Always thinking like a politician, he made sure his group's efforts were well publicized. For example, he appointed one of his fellow members of the [[Democratic National Committee]] to serve as counsel for a textile company and another the vice-president of a shipping line.&lt;ref name="Coben"/&gt;{{rp|128-35}}

In September 1918, Palmer testified at hearings held by the U.S. Senate's [[Overman Committee]] that the [[United States Brewers Association]] (USBA) and the rest of the overwhelmingly German&lt;ref name="Mittelman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mittelman|first1=Amy|title=Brewing Battles: A History of American Beer|date=2008|publisher=Algora Pub.|location=New York|isbn=978-0875865720|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; liquor industry harbored pro-German sentiments. He stated that "German brewers of America, in association with the United States Brewers' Association" had attempted "to buy a great newspaper" and "control the government of State and Nation", had generally been "unpatriotic", and had "pro-German sympathies".&lt;ref&gt;United States Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, ''Brewing and Liquor Interests and German Propaganda: Hearings Before a Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, Sixty-fifth Congress, Second and Third Sessions, Pursuant to S. Res. 307'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=gpNt3nvjWCMC&amp;printsec=frontcover volume 1], [https://books.google.com/books?id=cqwTAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA1392&amp;pg=PP1 volume 2]. Govt. print. off., 1919. Original from the University of Michigan. v. 1, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later criticism of Palmer's performance focused less on his appointments or the fees earned by political cronies than on his sales of enemy assets. He campaigned successfully to have his powers to dispose of assets by sale increased to counter Germany's long-term plan to conquer the world by industrial expansion even after the war. There were safeguards in place, but competitive bidding meant nothing when an auction was rigged by withholding information from all participants. More revelations took years to surface and the connections between Palmer and direct profits proved too tenuous to support indictments. Even after Germany's surrender, Palmer insisted on continuing his campaign to make American industry independent of German investment, with major sales in the metals industry in the spring of 1919, for example.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=990CE3D61E3BE03ABC4053DFB2668382609EDE&amp; "Break German Hold on American Metal," April 8, 1919], accessed January 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He offered his rationale in a speech to an audience of lawyers: "The war power is of necessity an inherent power in every sovereign nation. It is the power of self-preservation and that power has no limits other than the extent of the emergency."&lt;ref name="Coben"/&gt;{{rp|135-50, quote 149}} Among other sales, the United States assets of the chemical company [[Bayer]] were auctioned off and it lost its [[U.S. patent]] for [[Aspirin]].&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt;

==World War II==
On 11 March 1942, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] issued Executive Order 9095 establishing the Office of the Alien Property Custodian as an independent agency under his direct authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=16232 |title=Franklin D.

During the war the APC amassed a vast portfolio of enemy property including real estate, business enterprises, ships and intellectual property in the form of [[trademarks]], [[copyrights]], [[patents]] and pending patent applications. Following [[Nikola Tesla]]'s death at the [[New Yorker Hotel]] in 1943, the Alien Property Custodian seized much of Tesla's work from his hotel room even though Tesla was an American citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tesla - Master of Lightning: The Missing Papers|url=http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_mispapers.html|website=www.pbs.org|publisher=[[PBS]]|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FBI 100 - Top 10 Myths|url=https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/stories/2008/july/myths_072408|accessdate=28 February 2018|work=FBI.gov|publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]|date=July 24, 2008|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 13, 1966, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] issued Executive Order 11281 which abolished the office, effective June 30 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/131.html#131.1 |title=Records of the office of Alien Property |publisher=National Archives |accessdate=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sec. 6 of the [[Trading with the Enemy Act 1917|Trading with the Enemy Act]], {{USStat|40|415}}, 50 U.S.C.App., authorizes the [[President of the United States|President]] to appoint an official known as the "alien property custodian," who is responsible for "receiv[ing,] ... hold[ing], administer[ing], and account[ing] for" "all money and property in the United States due or belonging to an enemy, or ally of enemy ... ." The Act was originally enacted during World War I "to permit, under careful safeguards and restrictions, certain kinds of business to be carried on" among warring nations, and to "provid[e] for the care and administration of the property and property rights of enemies and their allies in this country pending the war." [[Marshall v. Marshall]], 126 S.Ct. 1735 (2006) (quoting from [[Markham v. Cabell]], 326 U.S. 404, 414, n. 1 (1945) ([[Justice Burton|Burton]], J., concurring)), ''see also'' S.Rep.

An officer of the [[Insolvency Service]] of the United Kingdom, an '''official receiver''' ('''OR''') is an officer of the court to which he is attached.  The OR is therefore answerable to the courts for carrying out the courts' orders and for fulfilling his duties under law.  He also acts on directions, instructions and guidance from the Service's Inspector General or, less often, from the [[Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]].

==Responsibilities==
An OR has the following responsibilities:
* acting as interim [[receivership|receiver]] or [[provisional liquidator]]: At any time after a petition for an insolvency order under s122 of the [[Insolvency Act 1986]] has been presented, the court may appoint the OR as interim receiver (for an individual) or as provisional liquidator (for a company).  This is to protect a debtor's property, or take control of a company' affairs, pending the outcome of the hearing of the petition;
* acting as receiver, trustee or liquidator: The OR becomes receiver and manager when a court makes a bankruptcy order against an individual.  The OR becomes the first liquidator when the court makes a winding-up order against a company.  The OR is responsible for protecting the assets of the insolvent person or company and will take immediate steps to secure any property or other assets.  If no private sector [[insolvency practitioner]] (IP) is subsequently appointed, the OR becomes the trustee of the insolvent person's estate or the liquidator or remains the liquidator of the company; and
*acting as supervisor: in a fast-track voluntary arrangement proposed by a bankrupt.

The bankrupt or the company directors must give the OR information about their own or the company's affairs. The OR will interview them, examine their financial records, and make background enquiries of others who have had dealings with them (e.g. banks, accountants etc.). In every case, the OR reports to creditors and shareholders giving details of assets and liabilities.

Depending on the nature and monetary value of the assets, the OR may arrange a meeting of the creditors (and of contributories in a winding-up) to consider appointing an IP to act as trustee or liquidator in his place.  Alternatively, the OR may consult the creditors and ask the Secretary of State to appoint an IP. (This is usually done when such an appointment needs to be made quickly – for instance, when there are large amounts of perishable goods).

If an IP is appointed, the OR will hand over administration.  Otherwise, the OR acts as trustee or liquidator to sell the assets, distribute the proceeds to creditors, and complete the administration of the estate (mostly achieved within 12 months of the insolvency order).  Whether or not the OR continues as trustee or liquidator, he remains responsible for investigating the insolvent's affairs.

==History==
The office of official receiver was established by the Bankruptcy Act 1883 (46 &amp; 47 Vict c 52). His role was originally confined to [[personal bankruptcy]], but it was extended to companies in compulsory liquidation by the Companies (Winding Up) Act 1890 (53 &amp; 54 Vict c 63).&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Millett]] in ''[[Official Receiver v Wadge Rapps &amp; Hunt]]'' [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldjudgmt/jd030731/wadge-1.htm UKHL 41]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Paulette cooper.jpg|thumb|[[Paulette Cooper]]]]
'''Operation Freakout''', also known as '''Operation PC Freakout''', was a [[Church of Scientology]] covert plan intended to have the U.S. author and journalist [[Paulette Cooper]] imprisoned or committed to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. The plan, undertaken in 1976 following years of church-initiated lawsuits and covert harassment, was meant to eliminate the perceived threat that Cooper posed to the church and obtain revenge for her publication in 1971 of a highly critical book, ''[[The Scandal of Scientology]]''. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] discovered documentary evidence of the plot and the preceding campaign of harassment during an investigation into the Church of Scientology in 1977, eventually leading to the church compensating Cooper in an out-of-court settlement.

==Background==
Cooper, a freelance journalist and author, had begun researching [[Scientology]] in 1968 and wrote a critical article on the church for the British magazine ''Queen'' (now ''[[Harper's Bazaar|Harpers Bazaar]]'') in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =[[Paulette Cooper|Cooper, Paulette]]  |   title =The Tragi-Farce of Scientology  | work =Queen  |date=December 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church promptly sued for libel, adding ''Queen'' to the dozens of British publications that it had already sued.&lt;ref&gt;Church of Scientology of California v. Queen Magazine Ltd., High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division, 1970-C-No. 5751.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Wallis  | first =Roy  |   title =[[The Road to Total Freedom]]  | publisher =[[Columbia University Press]]  | year =1976 |  page =205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Undeterred, Cooper expanded her article into a full-length book, ''The Scandal of Scientology'' (subtitled "A chilling examination of the nature, beliefs and practices of the "now religion'"). It was published by Tower Publications, Inc. of New York in the summer of 1971. The church responded by suing her in December 1971, demanding $300,000 for "untrue, libelous and defamatory statements about the Church."&lt;ref&gt;Church of Scientology of California vs. Paulette Cooper, et al., Los Angeles Superior Court, Docket No. C18558&lt;/ref&gt;

==1972–1976: Operations Daniel and Dynamite==
Cooper was seen as a high-priority target by the church's [[Guardian's Office]], which acted as a combination of [[intelligence agency]], [[legal]] office and [[public relations]] bureau for the church. As early as February 29, 1972, the church's third most senior official, Jane Kember, sent a directive to Terry Milner, the Deputy Guardian for Intelligence United States (DGIUS), instructing him to collect information about Paulette Cooper so that she could be "handled."&lt;ref name="sentencing"&gt;[[s:United States of America v. Jane Kember, Morris Budlong, Sentencing Memorandum|United States of America v. Jane Kember, Morris Budlong, Sentencing Memorandum]]; pp. 23-25&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Milner ordered his subordinates to "attack her in as many ways as possible" and undertake "wide-scale exposure of PC's sex life", a plan which was named [[List of Guardian's Office operations#Operations Daniel and Dynamite|Operation Daniel]].&lt;ref&gt;DG Info US, "Re: Intell US Weekly Report W/E 25 Sept &amp; 5 Oct 72", 10 October 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper counter-sued on March 30, 1972, demanding $15.4 million in damages for the ongoing harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Paulette Cooper vs. Church of Scientology of New York, et al., Supreme Court of State of New York, County of New York, Index No. 6732/72&lt;/ref&gt; However, the church stepped up the harassment, for instance painting her name and phone number on street walls so that she would receive obscene phone calls, and subscribing her to pornographic mailing lists. She also received anonymous death threats and her neighbors received letters claiming that she had a [[venereal disease]].&lt;ref name="marshall"&gt;{{cite news|last =Marshall|first =John|title =Files show spy reported woman's intimate words|work =[[The Globe and Mail]]|date =January 25, 1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cooper bomb threat.gif|left|thumb|The second of the two forged [[bomb threat]]s]]
In December 1972, the church launched a new attack called [[List of Guardian's Office operations#Operations Daniel and Dynamite|Operation Dynamite]]. That month, a woman ostensibly soliciting funds for [[United Farm Workers]] stole a quantity of stationery from Cooper's apartment. A few days later, the New York Church of Scientology "received" two anonymous bomb threats. The following May, Cooper was indicted for making the bomb threats and arraigned for a federal [[grand jury]]. The threats had been written on her stationery, which was marked with her fingerprints.

The charges were eventually dropped in 1975 with the filing of a [[Nolle prosequi]] order by the local [[United States Attorney|US Attorney's office]], but it was not until the fall of 1977 that the [[FBI]] discovered that the bomb threats had been staged by the Guardian's Office.&lt;ref name="sentencing" /&gt; A contemporary memorandum sent between two Guardian's Office staff noted on a list of jobs successfully accomplished: "Conspired to entrap Mrs. Lovely into being arrested for a felony which she did not commit. She was arraigned for the crime."&lt;ref name="marshall" /&gt;

The church sued Cooper again in 1975 in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and [[Australia]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Church of Scientology and Paulette Cooper (Spinster), High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division, No. 1975-C-No. 8345&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Church of Scientology of Detroit, Michigan, vs. Paulette Cooper and John Does and Mary Rowes, persons to be ascertained, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division, No. 75-70203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Church of the New Faith, Inc. and Miss Paulette Cooper and Tower Publications, Inc., No. 4297 of 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

The church itself imported Cooper's books into foreign countries for the express purpose of [[libel tourism|suing her in jurisdictions where the libel laws were stricter]] than in the United States.&lt;ref name="guardian09"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sect framed journalist over "bomb threats"|last=Beresford|first=David|date=February 9, 1980|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1976: Operation Freakout==
[[Image:Cooper freakout.gif|thumb|Part of the planning document for Operation Freakout, April 1976]]
In the spring of 1976, the Guardian Office leadership decided to initiate an operation with the aim "To get P.C. incarcerated in a mental institution or jail, or at least to hit her so hard that she drops her attacks." The planning document, dated April 1, 1976, declared the aim to be "[t]o remove PC from her position of power so that she cannot attack the C of S {{interp|Church of Scientology}}."&lt;ref name="sentencing" /&gt;

In its initial form Operation Freakout consisted of three different plans (or "channels", as the Guardian's Office termed them), tailored to implicate her by her [[Jewish]] descent:

# First, a woman was to imitate Paulette Cooper's voice and make telephone threats to [[Arab]] [[consulate]]s in [[New York City]].
# Second, a threatening letter was to be mailed to an Arab consulate in such a fashion that it would appear to have been done by Paulette Cooper.
# Third, a Scientologist volunteer was to impersonate Paulette Cooper at a laundromat and threaten the current president [[Gerald Ford]] and then [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]]. A second Scientologist would thereafter inform the FBI of the threat.&lt;ref name="sentencing" /&gt;

Two additional plans were added to Operation Freakout on April 13, 1976. The fourth plan called for Scientologist agents to gather information from Cooper so that the success of the first three plans could be assessed. The fifth plan was for a Scientologist to warn an Arab consulate by telephone that Paulette Cooper had been talking about bombing it. A sixth and final plan was added subsequently. It was effectively a re-run of the 1972 plot, requiring Scientologists to obtain Paulette Cooper's fingerprints on a blank piece of paper, type a threatening letter to Kissinger on that paper, and mail it. Guardian's Office staff member Bruce Raymond noted in an internal memo: "This additional channel {{interp|the sixth plan}} should really have put her away. Worked with all the other channels. The F.B.I. already think she did the bomb threats on the C of S {{interp|in 1972}}."&lt;ref name="sentencing" /&gt;

On March 31, 1976, Jane Kember telexed Henning Heldt, the Deputy Guardian U.S., to update him on the situation:

:"PC {{interp|Paulette Cooper}} is still resisting paying the money but the judgement stands in PT {{interp|present time}} ... Have her lawyer contacted and also arrange for PC to get the data that we can slap the writs on her. If you want legal docs, from here on we will provide. Then if she still declines to come we slap the writs on her before she reaches CW {{interp|Clearwater}} as we don't want to be seen publically {{Sic}} being brutal to such a pathetic victim from a concentration camp."&lt;ref name="sentencing" /&gt;

==Exposure and aftermath==
[[Image:1979 GrandJuryCover US v Hubbard.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Grand Jury Charges, Introduction, "[[United States of America v. Mary Sue Hubbard]]", [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]], 1979.]]
Ultimately, Operation Freakout was never put into effect. On June 11, 1976, two Scientology agents—Michael Meisner and Gerald Bennett Wolfe—were caught in the act of attempted [[burglary]] at a courthouse in [[Washington, D.C.]] as part of the Guardian's Office's ongoing [[Operation Snow White]]. The Guardian's Office was preoccupied for the next year with attempts to hush up the scandal, even going to the lengths of kidnapping Meisner and holding him [[wikt:incommunicado|incommunicado]] to prevent him from testifying.&lt;ref name="sentencing" /&gt; The church sought to bring a quick end to the dispute with Cooper in December 1976 when it proposed to settle with her, on condition that she was not to republish or comment on ''The Scandal of Scientology'' and agree to assign the book's copyright to the Church of Scientology of California.

On July 8, 1977, however, the FBI raided Scientology offices in [[Los Angeles]] and Washington, D.C., seizing over 48,000 documents. They revealed the extent to which the Church had committed "criminal campaigns of vilification, burglaries and thefts ... against private and public individuals and organizations," as the U.S. Government prosecutor put it.&lt;ref name="sentencing" /&gt; The documents were later released to the public, enabling Cooper and the world at large to learn about the details of Operation Freakout.

Sometime during late 1977, according to an affidavit given by Margery Wakefield, a secret meeting was held at the Guardian's Office where two murders were planned. The first of which was of a young man who had defected from Scientology and had been recaptured, and the second was an assassination of Cooper in which they were planning to shoot her dead. It is unknown whether or not these plans were attempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.xenu-directory.net/documents/wakefield19900413.html | title=Affidavit of Margery Wakefield | date=April 13, 1990 | author=Margery Wakefield | accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in the end nobody was indicted for the harassment of Cooper, the wider campaign of criminal activity was successfully prosecuted by the United States Government. [[Mary Sue Hubbard]], Jane Kember, Henning Heldt, Morris Budlong, Duke Snider, Dick Weigand, Greg Willardson, Mitchell Hermann and Cindy Raymond were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of theft, burglary, conspiracy, and other crimes. With the exception of Kember and Budlong, the defendants agreed to uncontested [[stipulation (law)|stipulation]] of the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lisatrust.freewinds.cx/legal/snowwhite/USAVMSH%20SENTENCING%20MEMO%201980-01-72.PDF United States of America v.

All of the defendants were imprisoned, serving up to four years in jail. Coincidentally, they were tried, convicted and sentenced in the same courthouse that their agents had been caught robbing.&lt;ref name="sentencing" /&gt;

The Church of Scientology filed at least 19 lawsuits against Cooper throughout the 1970s and 1980s, which Cooper considered part of "a typical Scientology dirty-tricks campaign" and which Cooper's attorney Michael Flynn said was motivated by L. Ron Hubbard's declaration that the purpose of a lawsuit was to "[[vexatious litigation|harass and discourage]]".&lt;ref name="Breeze"&gt;{{cite news |last =Staff | title =Redondo couple, N.Y. writer named in Scientology lawsuit | work =Daily Breeze|date =November 1, 1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.xenutv.com/hearings/cooper.htm | title=The 1982 Clearwater Hearings: Day 4 | date=May 8, 1982 | author=Paulette Cooper | accessdate=2007-02-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070103160959/http://www.xenutv.com/hearings/cooper.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper discontinued her legal actions against Scientology in 1985 after receiving an out-of-court settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Scientologists in dirty campaign to stop book | work =The Times | pages =7 |date=October 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Patent law}}
The '''''Patent Act''''' is [[Law of Canada|Canadian federal legislation]] and is one of the main pieces of Canadian legislation governing [[Canadian patent law|patent law in Canada]]. It sets out the criteria for [[patentability]], what can and cannot be patented in [[Canada]], the process for obtaining a Canadian patent, and provides for the enforcement of Canadian patent rights.

==Purpose==

The purpose of a patent is to protect [[inventions]]. Patents provide the owner of a patent with the exclusive right to make, use and sell a patented invention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-4/FullText.html Patent Act, RSC 1985, c P-4], s 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

These restrictions form a system of encouraging economic and technical growth. The patent is a contract between the inventor and the government who represents society. The inventor obtains a monopoly limited to a 20-year term of producing and selling the patent. Society gains disclosure of the invention and free use of it after the patent expires.&lt;ref name="A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CANADIAN PATENT SYSTEM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cbac-cccb.ca/epic/site/cbac-cccb.nsf/vwapj/Duy_CdnPatents_e.pdf/$FILE/Duy_CdnPatents_e.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 19, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028213733/http://cbac-cccb.ca/epic/site/cbac-cccb.nsf/vwapj/Duy_CdnPatents_e.pdf/$FILE/Duy_CdnPatents_e.pdf |archivedate=October 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first patent in Canada was granted by the [[National Assembly of Quebec|legislature of Quebec]] in 1791. No official patent act followed until about 30 years later when Upper and Lower Canada enacted patent acts in the 1820s.&lt;ref name="A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CANADIAN PATENT SYSTEM" /&gt; The provinces of Canada held responsibility for patents within their boundaries

The ''[[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]]'' established that patents were a federal responsibility. The first federal ''Patent Act'' was created in 1869. This act granted patents for a term of 15 years, divided into three five-year periods.&lt;ref name="A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CANADIAN PATENT SYSTEM" /&gt;

The second federal ''Patent Act'' was passed in 1872 and allowed foreigners to register patents.&lt;ref name="A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CANADIAN PATENT SYSTEM" /&gt;

In the 1880s and 1890s the ''Patent Act'' was amended to extend patent terms from 15 to 18 years, divided into three six-year periods.&lt;ref name="A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CANADIAN PATENT SYSTEM" /&gt;

The Patent Office and post of Commissionaire of Patents are established by statute between 1900 and 1919.&lt;ref name="A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CANADIAN PATENT SYSTEM" /&gt;

In 1923, the third federal ''Patent Act'' provided provisions for inventions created by public servants.&lt;ref name="A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CANADIAN PATENT SYSTEM" /&gt;

The fourth federal ''Patent Act'' was passed in 1935, this act had provisions for the procedure of obtaining patents on inventions related to national defence and atomic energy.&lt;ref name="A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CANADIAN PATENT SYSTEM" /&gt;

The Patent Office and position of Commissionaire of Patents were incorporated into the new [[Canadian Intellectual Property Office]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CANADIAN PATENT SYSTEM" /&gt;

In 1993, the requirement that an invention be not obvious was added to the ''Patent Act''.&lt;ref name="A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CANADIAN PATENT SYSTEM" /&gt;

In 1996, the [[TRIPS]] implementation act was passed.&lt;ref name="A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CANADIAN PATENT SYSTEM" /&gt;

Patents are extended from 18 to 20 years as a result of a [[WTO]] ruling that 18-year patents violate TRIPS requirements in 2001.&lt;ref name="Government Of Canada brings Patent Act into conformity with obligations under the World Trade Organization"&gt;[http://www.cipo.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/cipointernet-internetopic.nsf/en/wr00725e.html Canadian Intellectual Property Office - Government Of Canada brings Patent Act into conformity with obligations under the World Trade Organization&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applicable subject matter==

Patents apply to physical inventions and process, but not literary works, most software and other forms of intellectual property. For more information see [[Subject matter in patent law in Canada|patentable subject matter in Canada]].

==Patent enforcement==

It is the responsibility of patent owners to enforce their patents. This is done by taking potential offenders to court to determine if the patent has been infringed and obtain compensation. Court action can be very expensive and can deter people from enforcing their patents. The cost of a [[Patent infringement in Canadian law|patent infringement]] action in Canada can run from several hundred thousand dollars to several million dollars, depending on the complexity of the case.

The '''Public Domain Enhancement Act''' ('''PDEA''') ({{USBill|108|H.R.|2601}} (108th Congress), {{USBill|109|H.R.|2408}} (109th Congress)) was a bill in the [[United States Congress]] which, if passed, would have added a [[tax]] for [[copyright]]ed works to retain their copyright status.  The purpose of the bill was to make it easier to determine who holds a copyright (by determining the identity of the person who paid the tax), and to allow copyrighted works which have been abandoned by their owners, also known as [[orphan works]], to pass into the [[public domain]].

==Impact==
In the bill's latest form, the tax would have been a multiple-time affair, a sum of US$1 per work charged 50 years after the date of first publication or on December 31, 2006, whichever occurs later, and every 10 years thereafter until the end of the [[copyright term]], only on works first published within the United States (as charging it from foreigners would violate the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne convention]] except in some interpretations of the [[Berne three-step test]]). Failure to pay the [[United States Copyright Office|Copyright Office]] the copyright renewal fee on or before the date the fee is due or within a grace period of 6 months thereafter would allow the work to irreversibly lapse into the public domain in the United States and other countries and areas applying the [[rule of the shorter term]] of the Berne Convention. However, if payments are made in time, the copyright may be extended to the end of the normal maximum term, currently 95 years for a work made for hire. In practice, this would resemble copyright renewal under the [[Copyright Act of 1909]], but the bill will create a 50-year term renewable five times for 45 years.

The problem that the law attempts to solve is that the cost of locating the owner of a work is often prohibitive. For works that are still in print, this is usually not a problem, but otherwise there is typically not a clear record of whether the original creator transferred the rights, died, or had a clear successor to its rights.  The PDEA solves this problem by requiring a small tax to maintain copyright on a work. For works that the copyright owner no longer cares about, the copyright will lapse, and so copies and derivatives can be made freely.  The Act would also require the Copyright Office to maintain an easily searchable database, so that for works that the original publisher still wishes to maintain copyright on, potential derivative creators can find out who paid the US$1 tax and negotiate with them for permission.

==Legislative history==
This bill was first introduced in the House on June 25, 2003 by representatives [[Zoe Lofgren]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[California|CA]]) and [[John T. Doolittle]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-CA) where it went to the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary|House Committee on the Judiciary]].  On September 4, 2003, it moved to the House Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property.  On May 17, 2005 it was reintroduced by Lofgren as H.R. 2408, and was once again referred to the House Judiciary Committee.

==Opposition to PDEA==

Opposition to the Public Domain Enhancement Act comes from the entertainment industry sphere, particularly the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) and its lobbyists. In his book ''Free Culture'', [[Lawrence Lessig]] lays out the reason for the MPAA opposition to the bill:

# Congress had already "firmly rejected" the concept of copyright renewal in the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], which eliminated the need for registration and renewal of copyrighted works.
# The $1 fee would harm copyright owners, particularly those with large numbers of active and potentially commercially viable works.
# The extension fee would encourage copyright restoration, a process that re-asserts copyright over a public domain work that originated outside the US and for which US copyright was not renewed.&lt;ref&gt;Public Domain Sherpa. [http://www.publicdomainsherpa.com/copyright-restoration.html Copyright restoration and foreign works: be careful].&lt;/ref&gt;
# The benefits would fail to justify the administrative costs needed to set up and fund a registration system.
# The MPAA expressed concern about the effects of a story that underlies a currently copyrighted film moving into the public domain (although this would not invalidate the copyright of the film).
# The MPAA argues that current law already allows for the creation of derivative works via licensing and release of rights.

Proponents such as Lessig have suggested that copyright holders may be motivated to oppose the PDEA by a competitive threat: a huge wave of abandoned works would spill into the public domain which could form the basis of new derived works that would compete commercially with established copyrighted works.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Lessig. [http://www.free-culture.cc/freeculture.pdf Free Culture: The Nature and Future of Creativity], 252-256. Penguin. {{ISBN|0-14-303465-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public administration''' is the implementation of [[public policy|government policy]] and also an academic discipline that studies this implementation and prepares [[civil servant]]s for working in the public service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.infoplease.com/public-administration |title=Random House Unabridged Dictionary |publisher=Dictionary.infoplease.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a "field of inquiry with a diverse scope" whose fundamental goal is to "advance management and policies so that government can function".&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Public Administration''. Eds Jack Rabin, W. Bartley Hildreth, and Gerard J. Miller. 1989: Marcel Dekker, NY. p. iii&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the various definitions which have been offered for the term are: "the management of public programs";&lt;ref&gt;Robert and Janet Denhardt.

Definition of basic concepts and terminologies in governance and public administration. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Many unelected [[public servant]]s can be considered to be public administrators, including heads of city, county, regional, state and federal departments such as municipal budget directors, [[human resources]] (HR) administrators, [[city manager]]s, [[census]] managers, state [[mental health]] directors, and [[cabinet secretaries]].&lt;ref name="KettlDonald" /&gt; Public administrators are [[public servant]]s working in public departments and agencies, at all levels of government.

In the United States, civil servants and academics such as [[Woodrow Wilson]] promoted [[U.S. Civil Service Reform#The Pendleton Act|civil service reform]] in the 1880s, moving public administration into [[academia]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;Wilson, Woodrow. June, 1887. "[[The Study of Administration]]", ''Political Science Quarterly'' 2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, "until the mid-20th century and the dissemination of the German sociologist [[Max Weber]]'s theory of bureaucracy" there was not "much interest in a theory of public administration".&lt;ref&gt;Public administration.

In 1947 [[Paul H. Appleby]] defined public administration as "public leadership of public affairs directly responsible for executive action". In a democracy, it has to do with such leadership and executive action in terms that respect and contribute to the dignity, the worth, and the potentials of the citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Appleby, Paul 1947. "Toward Better Public Administration", ''[[Public Administration Review]]'' Vol. 7, No. 2 pp. 93–99.&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, Gordon Clapp, then Chairman of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] defined public administration "as a public instrument whereby democratic society may be more completely realized." This implies that it must "relate itself to concepts of justice, liberty, and fuller economic opportunity for human beings" and is thus "concerned with "people, with ideas, and with things".&lt;ref&gt;Clapp, Gordon. 1948. "Public Administration in an Advancing South", ''[[Public Administration Review]]'' Vol. 8. no. 2 pp. 169–75. Clapp attributed part of this definition to Charles Beard.&lt;/ref&gt; According to James D. Carroll &amp; Alfred M. Zuck, the publication by "Woodrow Wilson of his essay, "[[The Study of Administration]]" in 1887 is generally regarded as the beginning of public administration as a specific field of study".&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, J.D. &amp; Zuck, A.M. (1983). "The Study of Public Administration Revisited". ''A Report of the Centennial Agendas project of the American Society for Public Administration''. Washington, DC; American Society for Public Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on the democracy theme and discarding the link to the executive branch, [[Patricia M. Shields]] asserts that public administration "deals with the stewardship and implementation of the products of a living democracy".&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia. 1998. [https://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/3954 "Pragmatism as a Philosophy of Science: A Tool for Public Administration]" Research in Public Administration Vol. 4. pp. 195–225.&lt;/ref&gt;  The key term "product" refers to "those items that are constructed or produced" such as prisons, roads, laws, schools, and security. "As implementors, public managers engage these products." They participate in the doing and making of the "living" democracy. A living democracy is "an environment that is changing, organic", imperfect, inconsistent and teaming with values. "Stewardship is emphasized because public administration is concerned "with accountability and effective use of scarce resources and ultimately making the connection between the doing, the making and democratic values".&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia. 1998. [https://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/3954 "Pragmatism as a Philosophy of Science: A Tool for Public Administration"], ''Research in Public Administration'' Vol. 4. p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently scholars claim that "public administration has no generally accepted definition", because the "scope of the subject is so great and so debatable that it is easier to explain than define".&lt;ref name="thecanadianencyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/public-administration/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328003943/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/public-administration/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 28, 2017|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public administration is a field of study (i.e., a discipline) and an occupation. There is much disagreement about whether the study of public administration can properly be called a discipline, largely because of the debate over whether public administration is a subfield of [[political science]] or a subfield of [[administration (government)|administrative science]]", the latter an outgrowth of its roots in policy analysis and evaluation research.&lt;ref name="thecanadianencyclopedia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haveman, R. H. (1987). Policy analysis and evaluation research after twenty years. "Policy Studies Journal", 16(1): 191–218.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Donald Kettl is among those who view public administration "as a subfield within political science".&lt;ref name="h-net"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Future of Public Administration |first=Donald F. |last=Kettl |url=http://www.h-net.org/~pubadmin/tfreport/kettl.pdf  |format=PDF |publisher=H-net.org |accessdate=October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lalor a society with a public authority that provides at least one [[public good]] can be said to have a public administration whereas the absence of either (or ''a fortiori'' both) a public authority or the provision of at least one public good implies the absence of a public administration. He argues that public administration is the public provision of public goods in which the demand function is satisfied more or less effectively by politics, whose primary tool is rhetoric, providing for public goods, and the supply function is satisfied more or less efficiently by public management, whose primary tools are speech acts, producing public goods.  The moral purpose of public administration, implicit in its acceptance of its role, is the maximization of the opportunities of the public to satisfy its wants.&lt;ref&gt;Lalor, Stephen ''A General Theory of Public Administration'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[North American Industry Classification System]] definition of the Public Administration (NAICS 91) sector states that public administration "... comprises establishments primarily engaged in activities of a governmental nature, that is, the enactment and judicial interpretation of laws and their pursuant regulations, and the administration of programs based on them". This includes "Legislative activities, taxation, national defense, public order and safety, immigration services, foreign affairs and international assistance, and the administration of government programs are activities that are purely governmental in nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/cis-sic/cis-sic.nsf/IDE/cis-sic91defe.html |title=Definition Public Administration (NAICS 91) |publisher=Ic.gc.ca |accessdate= October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the academic perspective, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the United States defines the study of public administration as "A program that prepares individuals to serve as managers in the executive arm of local, state, and federal government and that focuses on the systematic study of executive organization and management. Includes instruction in the roles, development, and principles of public administration; the management of public policy; executive-legislative relations; public budgetary processes and financial management; administrative law; public personnel management; professional ethics; and research methods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/cipdetail.aspx?y=55&amp;cipid=88560 |title=CIP user site |publisher=Nces.ed.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Globalize/US|date=February 2016}}

===Antiquity to the 19th century===
Dating back to Antiquity, Pharaohs, kings and emperors have required pages, treasurers, and tax collectors to administer the practical business of government. Prior to the 19th century, staffing of most public administrations was rife with nepotism, favouritism, and political patronage, which was often referred to as a "[[spoils system]]". Public administrators have long been the "eyes and ears" of rulers. In medieval times, the abilities to read and write, add and subtract were as dominated by the educated elite as public employment. Consequently, the need for expert civil servants whose ability to read and write formed the basis for developing expertise in such necessary activities as legal record-keeping, paying and feeding armies and levying [[tax]]es.  As the European Imperialist age progressed and the militarily powers extended their hold over other continents and people, the need for a sophisticated public administration grew.

The field of [[management]] may well be said to have originated in ancient China,&lt;ref name="Ewan Ferlie p.30"&gt;Ewan Ferlie, Laurence E. Lynn, Christopher Pollitt (2005) ''The Oxford Handbook of Public Management'', p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; including possibly the first highly centralized [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] state, and the earliest (by the second century BC) example of an [[meritocracy|administration based on merit]] through [[Imperial examination|testing]].&lt;ref name="APHq"&gt;Kazin, Edwards, and Rothman (2010), 142. ''One of the oldest examples of a merit-based civil service system existed' in the imperial bureaucracy of China.''

Creel]] and other scholars find the influence of Chinese administration in Europe by the 12th century, for example, in [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Fredrick II]]'s promulgations, characterized as the "birth certificate of modern bureaucracy".&lt;ref&gt;Ewan Ferlie, Laurence E. Lynn, Christopher Pollitt 2005 p.30, ''The Oxford Handbook of Public Management''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herrlee G. Creel, 1974 p.119. "Shen Pu-Hai: A Secular Philosopher of Administration", ''Journal of Chinese Philosophy'' Volume 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Creel, "The Origins of Statecraft in China, I", ''The Western Chou Empire'', Chicago, pp.9-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Otto B. Van der Sprenkel, "Max Weber on China", ''History and Theory'' '''3''' (1964), 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Chinese administration cannot be traced to any one individual, emphasizing a [[merit system]] figures of the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Fa-Jia]] like 4th century BC reformer [[Shen Buhai]] (400–337 BC) may have had more influence than any other, and might be considered its founder, if not valuable as a rare pre-modern example of abstract theory of administration. Creel writes that, in Shen Buhai, there are the "seeds of the [[civil service examination]]", and that, if one wishes to exaggerate, it would "no doubt be possible to translate Shen Buhai's term Shu, or technique, as 'science'", and argue that he was the first political scientist, though Creel does "not care to go this far".&lt;ref&gt;Creel, What Is Taoism?, 94

The eighteenth-century noble, [[Frederick William I of Prussia|King Frederick William I of Prussia]], created professorates in [[Kameralism|Cameralism]] in an effort to train a new class of public administrators. The universities of [[Frankfurt an der Oder]] and [[University of Halle]] were [[Prussia]]n institutions emphasizing economic and social disciplines, with the goal of societal reform. [[Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi]] was the most well-known professor of Cameralism. Thus, from a Western European perspective, Classic, Medieval, and Enlightenment-era scholars formed the foundation of the discipline that has come to be called public administration.

[[Lorenz von Stein]], an 1855 German professor from [[Vienna]], is considered the founder of the science of public administration in many parts of the world. In the time of Von Stein, public administration was considered a form of administrative law, but Von Stein believed this concept too restrictive. Von Stein taught that public administration relies on many prestablished disciplines such as [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[administrative law]] and [[public finance]]. He called public administration an integrating science, and stated that public administrators should be concerned with both theory and practice. He argued that public administration is a science because knowledge is generated and evaluated according to the scientific method.

Modern American public administration is an extension of democratic governance, justified by classic and liberal philosophers of the western world ranging from [[Aristotle]] to [[John Locke]]&lt;ref&gt;''Second Treatise on Government''&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;Declaration of Independence&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, M., Mejia, B., and Georgiev, M. (Ed). 2010. AM Gov 2010. McGraw Hill: New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Woodrow Wilson (Nobel 1919).jpg|thumb|[[Woodrow Wilson]]]]
In the [[United States|United States of America]], [[Woodrow Wilson]] is considered the father of public administration. He first formally recognized public administration in an 1887 article entitled "[[The Study of Administration]]". The future president wrote that "it is the object of administrative study to discover, first, what government can properly and successfully do, and, secondly, how it can do these proper things with the utmost possible efficiency and at the least possible cost either of money or of energy".&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; Wilson was more influential to the science of public administration than Von Stein, primarily due to an article Wilson wrote in 1887 in which he advocated four concepts:

* Separation of politics and administration
* Comparative analysis of political and private organizations
* Improving efficiency with business-like practices and attitudes toward daily operations
* Improving the effectiveness of public service through management and by training civil servants, [[merit pay|merit]]-based assessment

The separation of politics and administration has been the subject of lasting debate.  The different perspectives regarding this dichotomy contribute to differentiating characteristics of the suggested generations of public administration.

By the 1920s, scholars of public administration had responded to Wilson's solicitation and thus textbooks in this field were introduced. A few distinguished scholars of that period were, [[Luther Gulick (social scientist)|Luther Gulick]], [[Lyndall Urwick]], [[Henri Fayol]], [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]], and others. Frederick Taylor (1856–1915), another prominent scholar in the field of administration and management also published a book entitled ''The Principles of Scientific Management'' (1911). He believed that scientific analysis would lead to the discovery of the "one best way" to do things or carrying out an operation. This, according to him could help save cost and time. Taylor's technique was later introduced to private industrialists, and later into the various government organizations (Jeong, 2007).&lt;ref name="JeongChun"&gt;Jeong Chun Hai Ibrahim, &amp; Nor Fadzlina Nawi. (2007). ''Principles of Public Administration: An Introduction.'' Kuala Lumpur: Karisma Publications. {{ISBN|978-983-195-253-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor's approach is often referred to as Taylor's Principles or Taylorism. Taylor's scientific management consisted of main four principles (Frederick W. Taylor, 1911):
* Replace rule-of-thumb work methods with methods based on a scientific study of the tasks.
* Scientifically select, train, and develop each employee rather than passively leaving them to train themselves.
* Provide "detailed instruction and supervision of each worker in the performance of that worker's discrete task" (Montgomery 1997: 250).
* Divide work nearly equally between managers and workers, so that the managers apply scientific management principles to planning the work and the workers actually perform the tasks.

Taylor had very precise ideas about how to introduce his system (approach):
'It is only through enforced standardization of methods, enforced adoption of the best implements and working conditions, and enforced cooperation that this faster work can be assured. And the duty of enforcing the adoption of standards and enforcing this cooperation rests with management alone.'&lt;ref&gt;Frederick W. Taylor. (1856–1915). ''Principles of Scientific Management''. New York &amp; London: Harper Brothers; Also see, Jeong Chun Hai Ibrahim, &amp; Nor Fadzlina Nawi. (2007). ''Principles of Public Administration: An Introduction.'' Kuala Lumpur: Karisma Publications. {{ISBN|978-983-195-253-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Society for Public Administration]] (ASPA) the leading professional group for public administration was founded in 1939. ASPA sponsors the journal [[Public Administration Review]], which was founded in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aspanet.org/scriptcontent/ASPAgeneral.cfm |title=Our Web Site Has Moved! |publisher=Aspanet.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203193218/http://www.aspanet.org/scriptcontent/ASPAgeneral.cfm |archive-date=2011-12-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===US in the 1940s===
[[File:Luther Gulick (social scientist).jpg|thumb|left|[[Luther Gulick (social scientist)|Luther Gulick]] (1892–1993) was an expert on public administration.]]

The separation of politics and administration advocated by Wilson continues to play a significant role in public administration today. However, the dominance of this dichotomy was challenged by second generation scholars, beginning in the 1940s. [[Luther Gulick (social scientist)|Luther Gulick]]'s fact-value dichotomy was a key contender for Wilson's proposed politics-administration dichotomy. In place of Wilson's first generation split, Gulick advocated a "seamless web of discretion and interaction".&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Brian R. 1989. Mastering Public Administration; from Max Weber to Dwight Waldo. Chatham, New Jersey: Chatham House Publishers, Inc. p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther Gulick and [[Lyndall Urwick]] are two second-generation scholars. Gulick, Urwick, and the new generation of administrators built on the work of contemporary behavioural, administrative, and organizational scholars including [[Henri Fayol]], [[Fredrick Winslow Taylor]], Paul Appleby, Frank Goodnow, and Willam Willoughby. The new generation of organizational theories no longer relied upon logical assumptions and generalizations about human nature like classical and enlightened theorists.

Gulick developed a comprehensive, generic theory of organization that emphasized the scientific method, efficiency, professionalism, structural reform, and executive control. Gulick summarized the duties of administrators with an acronym; [[POSDCORB]], which stands for planning, organizing, staffing, directing, coordinating, reporting, and budgeting. Fayol developed a systematic, 14-point treatment of private management. Second-generation theorists drew upon private management practices for administrative sciences. A single, generic management theory bleeding the borders between the private and the public sector was thought to be possible. With the general theory, the administrative theory could be focused on governmental organizations. The mid-1940s theorists challenged Wilson and Gulick. The politics-administration dichotomy remained the centre of criticism.

====1950s to the 1970s====
During the 1950s, the United States experienced prolonged prosperity and solidified its place as a world leader. Public Administration experienced a kind of heyday due to the successful war effort and successful post war reconstruction in Western Europe and Japan. Government was popular as was President Eisenhower. In the 1960s and 1970s, government itself came under fire as ineffective, inefficient, and largely a wasted effort.  The costly [[Vietnam War|American intervention in Vietnam]] along with domestic scandals including the bugging of Democratic party headquarters (the 1974 [[Watergate]] scandal) are two examples of self-destructive government behaviour that alienated citizens.
[[File:B-52D(061127-F-1234S-017).jpg|thumb|right|The costly [[Vietnam War]] alienated U.S. citizens from their government (pictured is [[Operation Arc Light]], a U.S. bombing operation)]]
There was a call by citizens for efficient administration to replace ineffective, wasteful bureaucracy. Public administration would have to distance itself from politics to answer this call and remain effective. Elected officials supported these reforms.  The [[Hoover Commission]], chaired by University of Chicago professor [[Louis Brownlow]], to examine reorganization of government. Brownlow subsequently founded the Public Administration Service (PAS) at the university, an organization which has provided consulting services to all levels of government until the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Concurrently, after [[World War II]], the whole concept of public administration expanded to include policymaking and analysis, thus the study of "administrative policy making and analysis" was introduced and enhanced into the government decision-making bodies. Later on, the human factor became a predominant concern and emphasis in the study of public administration. This period witnessed the development and inclusion of other social sciences knowledge, predominantly, psychology, anthropology, and sociology, into the study of public administration (Jeong, 2007).&lt;ref name="JeongChun" /&gt; Henceforth, the emergence of scholars such as, [[Fritz Morstein Marx]] with his book ''The Elements of Public Administration'' (1946), Paul H. Appleby ''Policy and Administration'' (1952), Frank Marini 'Towards a New Public Administration' (1971), and others that have contributed positively in these endeavors.

===1980s–1990s===
In the late 1980s, yet another generation of public administration theorists began to displace the last.  The new theory, which came to be called [[New Public Management]], was proposed by David Osborne and Ted Gaebler in their book ''Reinventing Government''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kamensky  | first = John M. | title = Role of the "Reinventing Government" movement in Federal management reform | journal = [[Public Administration Review]] | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 247–55 | doi = 10.2307/976448 | jstor = 976448  | date = May–June 1996 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new model advocated the use of private sector-style models, organizational ideas and values to improve the efficiency and service-orientation of the public sector. During the [[Clinton Administration]] (1993–2001), Vice President [[Al Gore]] adopted and reformed federal agencies using NPM approaches. In the 1990s, new public management became prevalent throughout the bureaucracies of the US, the UK and, to a lesser extent, in Canada. The original public management theories have roots attributed to policy analysis, according to [[Richard Elmore]] in his 1986 article published in the "[[Journal of Policy Analysis and Management]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Elmore | first = Richard F. | author-link = Richard Elmore | title = Graduate education in public management: working the seams of government | journal = [[Journal of Policy Analysis and Management]] | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–83 | doi = 10.1002/pam.4050060107 | date = 1986 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern authors define NPM as a combination of splitting large bureaucracies into smaller, more fragmented agencies, encouraging competition between different public agencies, and encouraging competition between public agencies and private firms and using economic incentives lines (e.g., performance pay for senior executives or user-pay models).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Margetts | first1 = Helen | last2 = Dunleavy | first2 = Patrick | last3 = Bastow | first3 = Simon | last4 = Tinkler | first4 = Jane | author-link1 = Helen Margetts | author-link2 = Patrick Dunleavy | title = New public management is dead – long live digital-era governance | journal = [[Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory]] | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 467–94 | doi = 10.1093/jopart/mui057 | date = July 2006 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; NPM treats individuals as "customers" or "clients" (in the private sector sense), rather than as citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Stone, (2008) "Global Public Policy, Transnational Policy Communities and their Networks", ''Journal of Policy Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics argue that the New Public Management concept of treating people as "customers" rather than "citizens" is an inappropriate borrowing from the private sector model, because businesses see customers as a means to an end (profit), rather than as the proprietors of government (the owners), opposed to merely the customers of a business (the patrons). In New Public Management, people are viewed as economic units not democratic participants which is the hazard of linking an MBA (business administration, economic and employer-based model) too closely with the public administration (governmental, [[public good]]) sector. Nevertheless, the NPM model (one of four described by Elmore in 1986, including the "generic model") is still widely accepted at multiple levels of government (e.g., municipal, state/province, and federal) and in many OECD nations.

In the late 1990s, Janet and Robert Denhardt proposed a new public services model in response to the dominance of NPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Denhardt | first1 = Robert B. | last2 = Vinzant Denhardt | first2 = Janet | title = The new public service: serving rather than steering | journal = [[Public Administration Review]] | volume = 60 | issue = 6 | pages = 549–59 | doi = 10.1111/0033-3352.00117 | jstor = 977437 | date = November–December 2000 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; A successor to NPM is [[digital era governance]], focusing on themes of reintegrating government responsibilities, needs-based holism (executing duties in cursive ways), and digitalization (exploiting the transformational capabilities of modern IT and digital storage). One example of this is [[Open Forum (Australia)|openforum.com.au]], an Australian non-for-profit eDemocracy project which invites politicians, senior public servants, academics, business people and other key stakeholders to engage in high-level policy debate.

Another new public service model is what has been called New Public Governance, an approach which includes a centralization of power; an increased number, role and influence of partisan-political staff; personal-politicization of appointments to the senior public service; and, the assumption that the public service is promiscuously partisan for the government of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Aucoin, Peter (2008). "New Public Management and the Quality of Government: Coping with the New Political Governance in Canada", Conference on ''New Public Management and the Quality of Government'', SOG and the Quality of Government Institute, University of Gothenburg, Sweden, 13–15 November 2008, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1980s, the goal of community programs in the United States was often represented by terms such as independent living, [[community integration]], inclusion, community participation, [[deinstitutionalization]], and civil rights. Thus, the same public policy (and public administration) was to apply to all citizens, inclusive of disability. However, by the 1990s, categorical state systems were strengthened in the United States (Racino, in press, 2014), and efforts were made to introduce more disability content into the public policy curricula&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Elmore | first1 = Richard F. | last2 = Watson | first2 = Sara | last3 = Pfeiffer | first3 = David | author-link1 = Richard Elmore | title = A case for including disability policy issues in public policy curricula | journal = Journal of Policy Analysis and Management (Curriculum and Case Notes) | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 167–73 | doi = 10.2307/3325146 | date = 1992 | ref = harv | jstor = 3325146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with disability public policy (and administration) distinct fields in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Zola | first = Irving K. | author-link = Irving Zola | contribution = Introduction | editor-last1 = Brown | editor-first1 = Susan T. | title = An Independent Living Approach to Disability Policy Studies | pages =  | publisher = Research and Training Center on Public Policy And Independent Living, World Institute on Disability | location = Berkeley, CA | year = 1993 | oclc = 36404707 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Racino | first = Julie A. | title = Public administration and disability community services administration in the US | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781466579828 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviorists have also dominated "intervention practice" (generally not the province of public administration) in recent years, believing that they are in opposition to generic public policy (termed [[ecological systems theory]], of the late [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]]).

Increasingly, [[public policy]] academics and practitioners have utilized the theoretical concepts of [[political economy]] to explain policy outcomes such as the success or failure of reform efforts or the persistence of suboptimal outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Corduneanu-Huci |first1= Cristina |first2= Alexander |last2=Hamilton |first3= Issel |last3=Masses Ferrer |year=2012 |title=Understanding Policy Change: How to Apply Political Economy Concepts in Practice |publisher= The World Bank |location= Washington DC. |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Understanding_Policy_Change.html?id=oKShuAAACAAJ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core branches==
In academia, the field of public administration consists of a number of sub-fields. Scholars have proposed a number of different sets of sub-fields. One of the proposed models uses five "pillars":&lt;ref name="Shafritz"/&gt;

*[[Organization theory|Organizational theory in public administration]] is the study of the structure of governmental entities and the many particulars inculcated in them.
*[[Public sector ethics|Ethics in public administration]] serves as a normative approach to decision making.
*[[Policy analysis]] serves as an empirical approach to decision making.
*[[Public budgeting]] is the activity within a government that seeks to allocate scarce resources among unlimited demands.
*[[Human Resource Management in Public Administration|Human resource management]] is an in-house structure that ensures that public service staffing is done in an unbiased, ethical and values-based manner. The basic functions of the HR system are employee benefits, employee health care, compensation, and many more (e.g., [[human rights]], [[Americans with Disabilities Act]]). The executives managing the HR director and other key departmental personnel are also part of the public administration system.

==Decision-making models==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
Given the array of duties public administrators find themselves performing, the professional administrator might refer to a theoretical framework from which he or she might work.  Indeed, many public and private administrative scholars have devised and modified decision-making models.

===Niskanen's budget-maximizing===
In 1971, Professor [[William Niskanen]] proposed a [[rational choice]] variation which he called the "[[budget-maximizing model]]". He claimed that rational bureaucrats will universally seek to increase the budgets of their units (to enhance their stature), thereby contributing to state growth and increased public expenditure. Niskanen served on President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisors; his model underpinned what has been touted as curtailed public spending and increased privatization. However, budgeted expenditures and the growing deficit during the Reagan administration is evidence of a different reality.  A range of pluralist authors have critiqued Niskanen's universalist approach.  These scholars have argued that officials tend also to be motivated by considerations of the public interest.

===Dunleavy's bureau-shaping===
The [[bureau-shaping]] model, a modification of Niskanen, holds that rational bureaucrats only maximize the part of their budget that they spend on their own agency's operations or give to contractors and interest groups.  Groups that are able to organize a "flowback" of benefits to senior officials would, according to this theory, receive increased budgetary attention. For instance, rational officials will get no benefit from paying out larger welfare checks to millions of low-income citizens because this does not serve a bureaucrats' goals. Accordingly, one might instead expect a jurisdiction to seek budget increases for defense and security purposes in place programming. If we refer back to Reagan once again, Dunleavy's bureau shaping model accounts for the alleged decrease in the "size" of government while spending did not, in fact, decrease. Domestic entitlement programming was financially deemphasized for military research and personnel.

==Academic field==
{{See also|Master of Public Administration|Doctor of Public Administration}}
University programs preparing students for careers in public administration typically offer the Master of Public Administration (MPA) degree, although in some universities, an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in Public Administration is awarded. In the [[United States]], the academic field of public administration draws heavily on [[political science]] and [[administrative law]]. Some MPA programs include economics courses to give students a background in microeconomic issues (markets, rationing mechanisms, etc.) and macroeconomic issues (e.g., national debt). Scholars such as [[John A. Rohr]] write of a long history behind the constitutional [[Legitimacy (political science)|legitimacy]] of government [[bureaucracy]]. In Europe (notably in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Germany]]), the divergence of the field from other disciplines can be traced to the 1720s [[Continental Europe|continental]] university curriculum. Formally, official academic distinctions were made in the 1910s and 1890s, respectively.

The goals of the field of public administration are related to the [[Democracy|democratic]] values of improving [[Egalitarianism|equality]], [[justice]], security, efficiency and effectiveness of public services in a non-profit venue; [[business administration]], on the other hand, is primarily concerned with expanding market share, generating revenue and earning [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]. For a field built on concepts ([[accountability]], [[governance]], [[decentralization]] and [[clientele]]), these concepts are often ill-defined and typologies often ignore certain aspects of these concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dubois |first1=Hans F. W. |last2=Fattore |first2=Giovanni |title= International Journal of Public Administration |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a913084156 |pages=704–27 |year=2009 |volume=32 |publisher=Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group |doi=10.1080/01900690902908760 |quote=The field of public administration knows many concepts. By focusing on one such concept, this research shows how definitions can be deceptive... | issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more specific term "[[public management]]" refers to ordinary, routine or typical management that aims to achieve [[public good]]. In some definitions, "public management" refers to private sector, market-driven perspective on the operation of government. This typically involves putting senior executives on performance contracts, rather than [[tenure]]d positions, instituting pay-for-performance systems for executives, creating revenue-generating agencies and so on.  This latter view is often called "[[New Public Management|new public management]]" (NPM) by its advocates.  New Public Management represents a reform attempt that emphasizes the professional nature of public administration{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. NPM advocates aim to replace the academic, moral or disciplinary emphasis of traditional public administration with a professional focus. Some theorists advocate a "bright line" differentiation of the professional field from related academic disciplines like political science and sociology; it remains interdisciplinary in nature.

One public administration scholar, Donald Kettl, argues that "public administration sits in a disciplinary backwater", because "for the last generation, scholars have sought to save or replace it with fields of study like implementation, public management, and formal bureaucratic theory".&lt;ref name="h-net" /&gt; Kettl states that "public administration, as a subfield within [[political science]]...is struggling to define its role within the discipline".&lt;ref name="h-net" /&gt; He notes two problems with public administration: it "has seemed methodologically to lag behind" and "the field's theoretical work too often seems not to define it"-indeed, "some of the most interesting recent ideas in public administration have come from outside the field".&lt;ref name="h-net" /&gt;

[[Public administration theory]] is the domain in which discussions of the meaning and purpose of government, the role of bureaucracy in supporting democratic governments, budgets, governance, and public affairs takes place.  In recent years, public administration theory has periodically connoted a heavy orientation toward critical theory and [[postmodern]] philosophical notions of government, governance, and power.  However, many public administration scholars support a classic definition of the term emphasizing constitutionality, public service, bureaucratic forms of organization, and hierarchical government.

===Comparative public administration===
Comparative public administration or CPA is defined as the study of administrative systems in a comparative fashion or the study of public administration in other countries. There have been several issues which have hampered the development of comparative public administration, including: the major differences between Western countries and developing countries; the lack of curriculum on this sub-field in public administration programs; and the lack of success in developing theoretical models which can be scientifically tested. Even though CPA is a weakly formed field as a whole, this sub-field of public administration is an attempt at cross-cultural analysis, a "quest for patterns and regularities of administrative action and behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jreisat|first=Jamil E.|date=2005-03-01|title=Comparative Public Administration Is Back In, Prudently|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00447.x/abstract|journal=Public Administration Review|language=en|volume=65|issue=2|pages=231–42|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00447.x|issn=1540-6210}}&lt;/ref&gt; CPA is an integral part to the analysis of public administration techniques. The process of comparison allows for more widely applicable policies to be tested in a variety of situations.

Comparative public administration emerged during the post-World War II period in order to seek international developmental strategies which aided in the [[containment]] of [[communism]] during the [[Cold War]]. (Riggs 1954, Heady 1960)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;utminers.utep.edu/spena2/PAD5355/WHAT%20IS%20CPA.ppt&lt;/ref&gt; The developers of this field expanded on a general theory, a research agenda, and generalized "lessons learned". (Riggs 1954, Heady 1960) A prominent figure of Public Administration, Woodrow Wilson, commented on the study by saying, "Like principles of civil liberty are everywhere fostering like methods of government; and if comparative studies of the ways and means of government should enable us to offer suggestions which will practicably combine openness and vigor in the administration of such governments with ready docility to all serious, well-sustained public criticism, they will have approved themselves worthy to be ranked among the highest and most fruitful of the great departments of political study".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/initiatives/first-principles/primary-sources/woodrow-wilson-on-administration |title=American Founders &amp;#124; The Heritage Foundation |publisher=Heritage.org |date=2013-07-08 |accessdate=2017-04-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112020613/http://www.heritage.org/initiatives/first-principles/primary-sources/woodrow-wilson-on-administration |archive-date=2017-01-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the financial state of the powering countries began to stabilize toward the decline of the Cold War, the field of CPA began to diminish.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The resulting decline caused the lack of further expansion of this study making it irrelevant.

Comparative public administration lacks curriculum, which has prevented it from becoming a major field of study. This lack of understanding of the basic concepts that build this field's foundation has ultimately led to its lack of use. For example, William Waugh, a professor at Georgia State University has stated "Comparative studies are difficult because of the necessity to provide enough information on the sociopolitical context of national administrative structures and processes for readers to understand why there are differences and similarities."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/194699522?accountid=5683|title=Off Campus Database Authentication|website=search.proquest.com|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also asserts, "Although there is sizable literature on comparative public administration it is scattered and dated."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Waugh argues that public administration requires an understanding of different administrative structures and a comparison of different public administration models. The literature to build this base of knowledge is scattered and often hard to obtain. The lack or ill-formed use of comparative public administration has been detrimental for many countries, including the United States. Fred Riggs a political scientist, states that "comparisons to the United States also can be problematic, because of the tendency of many American scholars to presume the American organizational structures and processes are models for other nations to emulate, which was a failing of early developmental administrative studies."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this, he claims the misuse and misapplication of comparative public administration has led to it being underdeveloped.

The development and better use comparative public administration could lead to better understanding. In 2002, the National Security Strategy was used in the battle of hearts and minds.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/209950790?accountid=5683|title=Off Campus Database Authentication|website=search.proquest.com|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tried to assimilate with an Arab and Islamic audience to push American values and democracy in an attempt to stop terrorism, when in fact the lack of comparison on the public level was ineffective and backfired.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The lack of willingness to understand their culture led to more tension in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In conclusion of these events there are not enough resources directed to the study of comparative public administration. For a basic understanding of sociopolitical structure of a society or culture is a key component of comparative public administration.

Despite all of its set backs there are examples of the application of well-formed Comparative Public Administration working in the world today. One of which is the comparison on the national level David Clark an author in this field states "In spite of similarities in public management reform rhetoric, it is argued that there is increasing divergence in the philosophy &amp; practice of public service in the two nations, &amp; and these differences reflect regimes that incorporate different ideals of citizenship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/218320986?accountid=5683|title=Off Campus Database Authentication|website=search.proquest.com|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This highlights the benefit of proper comparison of public administration. By examining patterns that emerge in international public sectors one can identify similarities and differences in many things including ideals of citizenship on the local level. Although the United States failed use of Comparative Public Administration in the Middle East is noted, they did properly incorporate it domestically. "During the Clinton administration, the focus on residential energy consumption in the United States was elevated to a high level with the inauguration of the Million Solar Roofs initiative, in which the Department of Energy (DOE) sponsored workshops, developed a pool of existing federal lending and financing options, and worked with partners in the solar and building industries to remove market barriers to strengthen grassroots demand for solar technologies".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/224021643?accountid=5683|title=Off Campus Database Authentication|website=search.proquest.com|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This grassroots demand may have come from the comparative knowledge that concluded "In the United States, residential and commercial buildings combined now use 71% of all electricity produced and account for 79% of all electricity expenditures. Annual CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission attributed to electricity consumption in these U.S. buildings constitute 43% of the country's annual total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission, which is approximately equivalent to the total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission of Japan, France, and the United Kingdom combined. These levels support the claim of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] that energy use in buildings offer more potential for reducing carbon emission than any other single sector in the United States and abroad.".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This example compares CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission in the United States to other countries and through the buildings sector; the US could cut down on CO2 emission. The field of comparative public administration is often misunderstood for the definition itself is complex and requires layers of understanding. The field will require many more years of collaborative research before it becomes a widely recognized academic study.

===Master's degrees===
[[File:School of Government.JPG|thumb|The Knapp-Sanders Building, the home of the School of Government at the [[University of North Carolina]].]]

Some public administration programs have similarities to [[business administration]] programs, in cases where the students from both the Master's in Public Administration (MPA) and Master's in Business Administration (MBA) programs take many of the same courses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In some programs, the MPA (or MAPA) is more clearly distinct from the MBA, in that the MPA often emphasizes substantially different ethical and sociological criteria that pertain to administering government programs for the public good that have not been key criteria for business managers, who typically aim to maximize [[Profit (economics)|profit]] or [[share price]].

The MPA is related to similar graduate-level government studies programs including [[Master of Arts]] (MA) programs in public affairs, [[public policy]], and [[political science]].  MPA degrees may be more likely to include program emphases on [[policy analysis]] techniques or other topical focuses such as the study of [[International relations|international affairs]] as opposed to MA degrees, which tend to focus on [[constitutional law|constitutional issues]] such as [[separation of powers]], [[administrative law]], contracting with government, problems of [[governance]] and power, and [[participatory democracy]]. Some MPA degrees may be more oriented towards training students to undertake public service work tasks, whereas some MA programs may have a more academic, theoretical focus. Some universities offer their Masters in public administration as an MA degree (e.g., [[Carleton University]] in Ottawa, Canada and the University of Kerala in India).

Some universities offer mid-career Master's programs, sometimes called an MC/MPA, that can be taken part-time (often outside of business hours) by public servants and public service managers who are working full-time. Community programs may offer internships or continuing education credits. One example is the Maxwell School's mid-career Masters at [[Syracuse University]], which was launched by Robert Iversen in the 1970s.

===Doctoral degrees===
There are two types of doctoral degrees in public administration: the Doctor of Public Administration (DPA) and the [[Ph.D.]] in public administration. The DPA is an applied-research doctoral degree in the field of public administration, focusing on the practice of public administration more than on its theoretical aspects. The DPA requires coursework beyond the Masters level and a thesis, dissertation or other doctoral project. Upon successful completion of the doctoral requirements, the title of "Doctor" is awarded and the post-nominals of D.P.A. can be used. Some universities use the Ph.D. as their doctoral degree in public administration (e.g., [[Carleton University]] in Ottawa, Canada, and the [[University Of Kerala]] in India). The Ph.D. is typically sought by individuals aiming to become [[professor]]s of public administration or researchers. Individuals pursuing a Ph.D. in public administration often pursue more theoretical dissertation topics than their DPA counterparts.

===Notable scholars===
{{main article|List of notable public administration scholars}}
Notable scholars of public administration have come from a range of fields. In the period before public administration existed as its own independent discipline, scholars contributing to the field came from economics, sociology, management, political science, administrative law, and, other related fields. More recently, scholars from public administration and public policy have contributed important studies and theories.

==International organizations==
There are a number of international public administration organizations. The Commonwealth Association of Public Administration and Management (CAPAM) is diverse, as it includes the 54 member states of the Commonwealth from India and the UK to Nauru. Its biennial conference brings together ministers of public service, top public officials and leading scholars. The oldest organization is the [[International Institute of Administrative Sciences]] (IIAS). Based in Brussels, Belgium, the IIAS is a worldwide platform providing a space for exchanges that promote knowledge and good practices to improve the organization and operation of public administration. The IIAS also aims to ensure that public agencies will be in a position to better respond to the current and future expectations and needs of society. The IIAS has set up four entities: the International Association of Schools and Institutes of Administration (IASIA), the European Group for Public Administration (EGPA), The Latin American Group for Public Administration (LAGPA) and the Asian Group for Public Administration (AGPA). IASIA is an association of organizations and individuals whose activities and interests focus on public administration and management. The activities of its members include education and training of administrators and managers. It is the only worldwide scholarly association in the field of public management. EGPA, LAGPA and AGPA are the regional sub-entities of the IIAS. Another body, the International Committee of the US-based [[Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration]] (NASPAA), has developed a number of relationships around the world.  They include sub regional and National forums like CLAD, INPAE and NISPAcee, APSA, ASPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.GlobalMPA.net |title=NASPAA International Web Portal |publisher=Globalmpa.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517102057/http://globalmpa.net/ |archivedate=2014-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Latin American Administration for Development (CLAD), based in [[Caracas, Venezuela]], this regional network of schools of public administration set up by the governments in Latin America is the oldest in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clad.org.ve |title=CLAD |publisher=CLAD |date=2007-08-29 |accessdate=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is a founding member and played a central role in organizing the Inter-American Network of Public Administration Education (INPAE). Created in 2000, this regional network of schools is unique in that it is the only organization to be composed of institutions from North and Latin America and the Caribbean working in public administration and policy analysis. It has more than 49 members from top research schools in various countries throughout the hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebape.fgv.br/inpae] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525004501/http://www.ebape.fgv.br/inpae|date=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NISPAcee is a network of experts, scholars and practitioners who work in the field of public administration in central Europe and Eastern Europe, including the Russian Federation and the Caucasus and Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Floyd |last=Studio |first2= Ján |last2=Andruch |url=http://www.nispa.sk/_portal/homepage.php|title=Homepage - NISPAcee Information Portal|work=nispa.sk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US public administration and political science associations like NASPAA, American Political Science Association (APSA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org |title=APSA - American Political Science Association |publisher=Apsanet.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and American Society of Public Administration (ASPA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aspanet.org aspanet.org]&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations have helped to create the fundamental establishment of modern public administration.

[[Eastern Regional Organization for Public Administration]] (EROPA) is a state-membership based organization, open to other organizations and individuals, headquartered in [[The Philippines]] with centres and membership organized around the [[Asia Pacific]] region. EROPA organizes annual conferences, and publishes a journal ''Asian Review of Public Administration'' (ARPA). It has a number of centres in the region, and assists in networking experts with its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eastern Regional Organization for Public Administration|url=http://www.eropa.org.ph|website=Eastern Regional Organization for Public Administration|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public management==

"Public management" is an approach to government administration and non-profit administration that resembles or draws on private-sector [[management]] and [[business]] techniques and approaches. These business approaches often aim to maximize [[wikt:efficiency|efficiency]] and [[effectiveness]] and provide improved [[customer service]].  A contrast is drawn with the study of public administration, which emphasizes the social and cultural drivers of government that many contend (e.g., [[Graham T. Allison]] and [[Charles Goodsell]]) makes it different from the private sector.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Studying and teaching about public management are widely practiced in [[developed nation]]s.

'''''Sampson v. Channell''''', 110 [[F.2d]] 754 ([[1st Cir.]] 1940),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Sampson v. Channell |vol=110 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=754 |pinpoint= |court=1st Cir. |date=1940 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/1940864110f2d7541639 |accessdate=2017-12-27 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[United States Court of Appeals]] decision interpreting the application of the ''Erie doctrine'' (derived from ''[[Erie v. Tompkins]]'') where [[diversity jurisdiction]] is invoked in a [[choice of law]] situation, where a court in one state may be called upon to apply the laws of another state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lea|first=Brilmayer|title=Conflict of laws|date=2003|publisher=CITIC Publishing house|pages=131-137}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Appellate court concluded that the federal district court must act as if it were a state court of the state in question, so long as the application of the state's substantive law might change the outcome of the case. This led to the anomaly that the federal courts must treat certain things (such as [[Legal burden of proof|burdens of proof]] and [[Statute of limitations|statutes of limitations]]) as substantive law, even if the state treats these same things as merely procedural, as a justification for using their own law instead of the law of another state.

==Facts==
The [[plaintiff]] husband and wife were hit by a car in [[Maine]]; the driver of the other car was killed. The plaintiffs sued the [[estate (law)]] of the dead driver in the [[Federal District Court]] in [[Massachusetts]], naming the [[executor]] of the dead driver's estate as the [[defendant]] and invoking the court's [[diversity jurisdiction]]. The District court applied general principles of conflicts of law, determining that Maine law should control the case because that is where the accident happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Sampson v. Channell |vol=27 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=213 |pinpoint= |court=D. Mass. |date=1939 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/193924027fsupp2131176 |accessdate=2017-12-27 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Maine law, the plaintiffs had the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] to show that they were ''not'' [[contributorily negligent]]; had the court applied Massachusetts law, the defendant would have had the burden of showing plaintiff's contributorily negligence. The plaintiff appealed, contending that the Massachusetts Federal District Court should have applied the law of Massachusetts.

==Issue==
#  Should the Fed. Dist. Court have used federal rules of procedure, or the rule of the state?
#  If the rule of the state applies, which state is it?

==Result==
The [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] wrote that the policy of the ''Erie doctrine'' is not to allow the choice of forum be outcome determinative, stating that "it is unfair and unseemly to have the outcome of litigation substantially affected by the fortuitous existence of diversity of citizenship." Therefore, if applying the law of the state would change the outcome as it might in a burden-of-proof situation where one of the parties is dead, then the Federal Court will treat it as substantive, and apply the law of the state. The question remained as to which state's law would apply.

To determine the solution to this controversy, the Appellate Court asks and answers three questions:
#  If the case had been brought in Massachusetts state court, would Massachusetts have brought in the Maine burden of proof?&lt;br /&gt;'''Answer:''' no, because Massachusetts courts have already held the burden of proof to be merely procedural, and those are decided by the law of the forum.
#  Would the U.S. Supreme Court have any reason to reverse Massachusetts on such a decision?&lt;br /&gt;'''Answer:''' no, because nothing in the Constitution requires Massachusetts to follow the same conflicts of law principles as any other state (especially since the Massachusetts law was statutory).
#  Does the invocation of diversity of citizenship change any of this?&lt;br /&gt;'''Answer:''' no, because Federal District Courts are tied to the law of the state they are in, not free to choose the law of the state they prefer.  Besides, then the Fed. Court would have treat the burden-of-proof law of Massachusetts as procedural  in order to ignore it, but at the same time would have to treat the burden-of-proof law of Maine as substantive in order to apply it, which would be inconsistent.

Therefore, the judgment was reversed and remanded, with an instruction to the district court to apply the Massachusetts burden of proof.

The '''''San Diego Journal of Climate and Energy Law''''' is a student-run [[law review]] published at the [[University of San Diego School of Law]]. The journal primarily publishes articles and comments discussing [[environmental law|environmental law and policy]] with a particular focus on issues relating to [[climate change]] and [[Energy law|energy]].&lt;ref name = aboutSDJCEL&gt;{{smallcaps|San Diego Journal of Climate and Energy Law}}, [http://www.sandiego.edu/law/academics/journals/jcel/index.php Journal Homepage] (Accessed August 22, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==
The journal was founded by students at the University of San Diego School of Law who wanted to create the "nation's first student-run law journal focused exclusively on legal aspects of the world's transition to a climate-safe economy."&lt;ref name = DelMonte&gt;Thomas R. Del Monte, ''Letter from the Founding Editor'', 1 {{smallcaps|San Diego J. Climate &amp; Energy L.}} iv (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[editor-in-chief]] of the journal's first issue remarked that he hoped the journal would generate "meaningful discussion that will provide real-world solutions" to problems associated with climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Vic A. Merjanian, ''Letter from the Editor'', {{smallcaps|San Diego J. Climate &amp; Energy L.}} iii (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The faculty of the university granted approval for the journal in 2008, and the first edition was published in 2009.&lt;ref name = DelMonte/&gt; To generate article submissions for the first issue, the journal's editorial board hosted a symposium on topics relating to climate change and energy law.&lt;ref name = DelMonte/&gt;

==Overview==
The journal publishes scholarship relating to climate change and energy law, including "claims related to climate change, law and economics associated with cap-and-trade greenhouse gas markets, new energy policy of the carbon-constrained world, legal implications of trans-border air and water pollution, and effects of climate change on endangered species law."&lt;ref name = aboutSDJCEL/&gt; In 2016, [[Washington and Lee University]]'s Law Journal Rankings placed the journal among the top twenty-five highest ranked environmental, natural resources, and land use law journals by overall score.&lt;ref name=wl&gt;[http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx "Law Journals: Submission and Ranking, 2008-2015,"] Washington &amp; Lee University (Accessed: September 25, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The journal also hosts an annual symposium on the topic of climate and energy law.&lt;ref name = aboutSDJCEL/&gt;

'''Seth David Schoen''' (born September 27, 1979) is senior staff [[Technology|technologist]] for the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], a technology civil rights organisation, and has been actively involved in discussing digital [[copyright]] law and [[encryption]] since the 1990s. He is an expert in [[trusted computing]].

In February 2008, Schoen collaborated with a Princeton research group led by [[Edward Felten]] that discovered a vulnerability of [[Dynamic random access memory|DRAM]] that undermined the basic assumptions of computer encryption security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citp.princeton.edu/memory/ |title=Center for Information Technology Policy » Lest We Remember: Cold Boot Attacks on Encryption Keys |publisher=Citp.princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/22/technology/22chip.html?_r=0 | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Researchers Find Way to Steal Encrypted Data | first=John | last=Markoff | date=February 22, 2008 | accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2005, Schoen led a small research team at EFF to decode the tiny tracking dots hidden in the printouts of some laser printers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2005/10/16 |title=Press Releases: October, 2005 &amp;#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seth attended [[Northfield Mount Hermon School]] in [[Northfield, Massachusetts]] from 1993–1997. While attending [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], Schoen founded [[Californians for Academic Freedom]] to protest the [[loyalty oath]] the state made university employees swear. Schoen later worked for [[Linuxcare]], where he developed the [[Linuxcare Bootable Business Card]]. After he left Linuxcare, he forked the project to create the [[LNX-BBC]] rescue system, of which he is a lead developer. Schoen was formerly a board member and the Secretary of the [[Peer-Directed Projects Center]], a Texas-based [[non-profit corporation]], until he stepped down in November 2006.

Schoen is the author of the [[DeCSS haiku]].&lt;ref name="Coleman2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22841">The [[United States Constitution]] has had influence internationally on later constitutions and legal thinking. Its influence appears in similarities of phrasing and borrowed passages in other constitutions, as  well as in the principles of the [[rule of law]], [[separation of powers]] and recognition of [[civil liberties|individual rights]]. The United American experience of amendments and [[judicial review]] motivated constitutionalism at times when they were considering the possibilities for their nation's future. Examples include [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the American Civil War, his contemporary and ally [[Benito Juárez]] of Mexico, and the second generation of 19th-century constitutional nationalists, [[José Rizal]] of the Philippines and [[Sun Yat-sen]] of China. However, democratizing countries often chose more centralized British or French models of government, particularly the [[Westminster system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Terrill|first1=Richard J.|title=World Criminal Justice Systems: A Comparative Survey|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317228820|pages=20–27|edition=revised|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ3hCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the later half of the 20th century, the influence of the United States Constitution may be waning as other countries have revised their constitutions with new influences.

==National constitutions==
The historian [[William H. McNeill (historian)|William H. McNeill]] argued that the United States saw itself as "one of a family of peoples and nations" making a history apart from the European civilization of their colonization.{{sfn|Billias|2009|loc=xi–xv}}

The United States Constitution is an expression of Americans diverging from colonial rule, according to this viewpoint. Its effect is reflected in the ideals of limiting the rulers of a state apart and above sitting law-givers in a [[parliament]]. The concepts of governance influencing others internationally are not only found among similarities in phrasing and entire passages from the U.S. Constitution. They are in the principles of the [[rule of law]] and recognition of individual rights. The American experience of fundamental law with amendments and [[judicial review]] has motivated foreign constitutionalists to reconsider possibilities for their own future.{{sfn|Billias|2009|loc=xi–xv}} This view informed [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[American Civil War]],{{refn| group=lower-alpha |"Secession was indeed unconstitutional...military resistance to secession was not only constitutional but also morally justified.{{sfn|Farber|2003|p=3}} "the ''primary'' purpose of the Constitution was … to create ‘a more perfect union’... the Constitution was an exercise in nation building.{{sfn|Farber|2003|p=198}}}} his contemporary and ally [[Benito Juarez]] of Mexico,{{refn| group=lower-alpha |Juarez regarded the United States as a model of republican democracy and consistently supported Abraham Lincoln.{{sfn|Stacy|2003|p=436}}}} and the second generation of 19th constitutional nationalists, [[José Rizal]] of the Philippines{{refn| group=lower-alpha |The institutions of the two countries which have most influenced constitutional development are Spain and the United States." One of the reforms, "sine quibus non", to use the words of Rizal and Mabini, always insisted upon by the Filipinos, was Philippine representation in the [[Cortes Generales|Spanish Cortez]], the promulgation in the Islands of the Spanish Constitution, and the complete assimilation equal to that of any in the Spanish provinces on the continent.{{sfn|Malcolm|1920|p=109}}}} and [[Sun Yat-sen]] of China.{{refn| group=lower-alpha |In the modern history of China, there were many revolutionaries who tried to seek the truth from the West in order to overthrow the feudal system of the [[Ching Dynasty]]. [[Sun Yat-sen]] for example was much influenced by American democracy, especially the U.S. Constitution.{{sfn|Qing Yu|1988|p=193}}}} The [[Australian Constitution]] which came into force in 1901 was strongly influenced by the US Constitution, while at the same time preserving Westminster traditions and the British monarchy. It adopted a federal system similar to the US, with a senate that represented the states. It also adopted the concepts of a formal separation of power and judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=George |last2=Brennan|first2=Sean|last3=Lynch|first3=Andrew|title=Blackshield and Williams Australian Constitutional Law and Theory |year=2014 |edition=6 |publisher=Federation Press |location=Leichhardt, NSW |isbn=978-1-86287-918-8| pages=77–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the influence of the Constitution appears in trans-national [[history of ideas]], foreign translations, and exchanges between Americans and their counterparts from the beginning with smuggled translations into [[Hispanic America]] until today with conferences among national legislators. Innovations include [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional conventions]], written constitutions, ratification and [[Constitutional amendment|amendment procedures]]. There are common provisions for presidential executives, [[federalism]] and judicial review.{{sfn|Billias|2009|loc=xi–xv}}

[[George Athan Billias]], studying the Constitution and related documents, describes six waves of influence:
# From 1776 to 1811, after the American Revolution began, it influenced northwestern Europe and its colonial connections.
# 1811–1848, after the decline of [[Napoleon]]'s reputation, it was referenced by Latin American, Caribbean, and European nationalists.
# 1898–1918, after the [[Spanish–American War]], nationalist movements borrowed from the U.S. Constitution in Asia and Latin America.
# 1918–1945, after World War I, its influence spread with movements for [[decolonization of Africa]], Mid-east and Asia.
# 1945–1974, after World War II, independence movements consulted it.
# 1974–1989, after [[United Nations]] expansion, once nondemocratic regimes, including European ones, transitioned towards constitutional democracies incorporating elements of the U.S. Constitution.{{sfn|Billias|2009|loc=xi–xv}}

Over its history, the influence of American [[constitutionalism]] has waxed and waned. [[Democratization|Democratizing]] countries often chose the more centralized, consolidated British or French models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Arjomand|editor1-first=Saïd Amir|title=Constitutionalism and political reconstruction|date=2007|publisher=Brill|isbn=9004151745|pages=92–94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kYmmnYKEvE0C&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;ots=nOUN11pmfK&amp;pg=PA94#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author1=Julian Go|chapter=A Globalizing Constitutionalism?, Views from the Postcolony, 1945–2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnston|first1=Douglas M.|last2=Reisman|first2=W.

Internationally it appears that those of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] and [[Islamic culture]]s do not readily adopt some of its premises. Nevertheless, "the influence of American constitutionalism abroad was profound in the past and remains a remarkable contribution to humankind's search for freedom under a system of laws."{{sfn|Billias|2009|loc=xi–xv}}

According to a 2012 study published in the ''[[New York University Law Review]]'', however, the influence of the U.S. Constitution may be waning. The study examined more than 700 federal constitutions from nearly 200 countries. "Rather than leading the way for global constitutionalism, the U.S. Constitution appears instead to be losing its appeal as a model for constitutional drafters elsewhere," the researchers write. "The idea of adopting a constitution may still trace its inspiration to the United States, but the manner in which constitutions are written increasingly does not."&lt;ref name=jr-diusc&gt;{{cite news |url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/federalstate/decline-influence-united-states-constitution/ |title=The Declining Influence of the United States Constitution |date=April 9, 2013 |website=Journalist's Resource |publisher=[[Harvard Kennedy School of Government]] [[Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy]] |accessdate=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=diusc&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Law |first1=David S. |last2=Versteeg |first2=Mila |year=2012 |title=The Declining Influence of the United States Constitution |journal=[[New York University Law Review]] |volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=762–858 |ssrn=1923556}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the study found that the U.S. Constitution guarantees relatively few rights compared to the constitutions of other countries and contains less than half (26 of 60) of the provisions listed in the average bill of rights. It is also one of the few in the world today that still features the [[right to keep and bear arms]]; the only others are the constitutions of [[Guatemala]] and [[Mexico]]. Overall, the research suggests that the [[Constitution of Canada]], revised in 1982, is now a leading international model rather than that of the United States.&lt;ref name=jr-diusc /&gt;&lt;ref name=diusc /&gt;

In 1937 the U.S. Post Office released a commemorative stamp to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Constitution. The engraving shown on this issue is after [[commons:File:Washington Constitutional Convention 1787.jpg|an 1856 painting]] by [[Junius Brutus Stearns]] of Washington and shows delegates signing the Constitution at the 1787 Convention. George Washington is on dais with an open document in hand; James Madison sits at the table, taking his famous notes on the convention.

One commemorative of the 19th Amendment (permitting women the right to vote) was celebrated in a commemorative in 1950 and again in 1970. The woman is voting in a curtained mechanical voting booth. She chooses levers to punch or mark her votes on a paper roll. The Model T has a male driver with a banner "Votes for women" on the car, women riders and marchers as though in a parade.

The [[Second Polish Republic]] issued a commemorative of the U.S. and Polish Constitutions in 1938 under the government of Prime Minister, Major General [[Felicjan Sławoj Składkowski|Składkowski]] The stamp features George Washington in military regalia, holding a 48-star American flag and a drawn sword. Thomas Paine holds a book on a rod, and Kosciuszko poses with a cross and saber. The next scene shows a line of infantry flying a Polish flag. The right panel shows the Statue of Liberty imposed in front of the New York 1930s skyline.

In 1937 the [[Second Spanish Republic]] commemorated the 150th anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Constitution, under the government of Prime Minister [[Juan Negrín]] of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE). The [[Statue of Liberty]] is the central focus, flanked by flags of Spain and the United States. The [[Flag of the Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic Flag]] of red, yellow and purple, as battle flag or [[civil ensign]], lacks the [[Coat of arms of the Second Spanish Republic|coat of arms]].

{{canon law}}
'''''Vacatio legis''''' ({{lang-la|absence of law}}) is a technical term in both [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3.HTM 1983 Code of Canon Law, Canon 8]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[law|civil law]] which refers to the period between the [[promulgation]] of a [[law]] and the time the [[law]] takes legal effect.&lt;ref&gt;The Vatican Collection'' "Vatican Council II: Volume 1: The Conciliar and Post Conciliar Documents"'' (New Revised Edition, General Editor: Austin Flanery, [[Order of Preachers|O.P.]]), page 43, footnote "c"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Manual70/&gt;

==Canon law==
{{main|Promulgation (canon law)}}
{{further|Canon law (Catholic Church)|Jurisprudence of canon law}}
In the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[1983 Code of Canon Law|Latin Church]], the ''vacatio legis'' is three months for universal laws,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3.HTM Canon 8 §1]&lt;/ref&gt; and one month for particular laws,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3.HTM Canon 8 §2]&lt;/ref&gt; unless the law itself establishes a longer or shorter period of time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3.HTM Canon 8 §1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3.HTM Canon 8 §2]&lt;/ref&gt; Months are reckoned according to the calendar from the date of publication.&lt;ref name=Manual70&gt;Fernando della Rocca, "Manual of Canon Law", pg. 70 (§37)&lt;/ref&gt; The law can stipulate a longer or shorter time of ''vacatio'' than that which is stipulated generally.&lt;ref name=Manual70/&gt;

[[Stanislaus Woywod]] says of ''vacatio legis'':
{{quote|The period of time allowed before a new law after its official [[promulgation (canon law)|promulgation]] goes into force is known in the terminology of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] as the vacatio legis. [[canon lawyer|Canonists]] have generally held that for all laws promulgated by the [[Holy See]] two months time is granted before in places outside the [[Rome|City of Rome]] the obligation of observing the law begins. For very remote countries even a longer time has been conceded, in order to let the knowledge of the law become sufficiently disseminated to make its enforcement possible. In more recent times the Holy See has in important laws frequently specified the period of the vacatio legis, as for instance in the case of the [[decree (canon law)|decree]] Ne Tenure which was published about eight months before it was to be enforced. The general principle, however, valid in [[law|civil law]] as well as in Canon Law, is that it is the duty of subjects to keep themselves informed through the ordinary channels of information, as, for instance, official magazines and papers, what laws, amendments, decisions, etc., have been enacted by the authorities. It is not necessary, hence, that the bishop announce to his clergy the laws and regulations passed by the supreme authority of the Church, nor can it be said that this is his duty, though for uniformity of action on part of the clergy of a [[diocese]] it is advantageous that the bishop announce to his priests the important new laws with direction to make them known on one and the same day to the people throughout the diocese.&lt;ref&gt;Woywod, Rev.

==Civil law==
In [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], ''vacatio legis'' "indicates a condition of non-validity of a norm, and because there is one that is already taken and yet to come into force (for the course prescribed time, or not yet taken for ratification or otherwise processing of the application procedure), and because you know or at least perceive the need for regulation of a subject to which, during the period, there are no rules.

'''''Vickery v McLean''''' [2006] NZAR 481 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding claims in defamation and the defence of free speech.&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=6th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=9781877511400|year=2010 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Harold Vickery was concerned that there may have been criminal activity at the [[Papakura District Council]] when it contracted out its water services, so much so that he had lodged complaints with both the [[Office of the Ombudsman (New Zealand)|Ombudsman Office]] and the [[Serious Fraud Office (New Zealand)|Serious Fraud Office]].

Vickery then sent [[The New Zealand Herald]] a letter claiming that "there was serious enough circumstantial evidence to suggest criminal irregularity may have taken place" at the PDC by these council employees, who were not elected council officials.

The Council employees in reply sued Vickery for defamation, and he used the claim of [[qualified privilege]] as a defence, as outlined in Lange.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal limited the defence of qualified privilege, as outlined in Lange, to elected officials, such as councillors, MPs, and mayors, and not to unelected public officials, as were the plaintiffs here. Thus Vickery's defamation defence was dismissed.
