During the '''Parade of Nations''' portion of the [[1996 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]], athletes from each country participating in the Olympics paraded in the arena, preceded by their flag. The flag was borne by a sportsperson from that country chosen either by the [[National Olympic Committee]] or by the athletes themselves to represent their country.

==Parade order==
As the nation of the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first]] modern [[Olympic Games]], [[Greece]] entered the stadium first; whereas, the host nation of the [[United States at the 1996 Summer Olympics|United States]] marched last. Other countries entered in alphabetical order in the language of the host country ([[English language|English]]), according with tradition and [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Staff | date = November 2005 | title=Technical Manual on Ceremonies|url=http://www.gamesmonitor.org.uk/files/Technical_Manual_on_Ceremonies.pdf| format = PDF;| publisher= [[International Olympic Committee]] |accessdate=11 June 2012 | page = 39_107 | quote = The delegations parade in alphabetical order according to the language of the host country, except for Greece, which leads the parade, and for the host country, which enters the stadium last.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst most countries entered under their [[List of sovereign states|short names]], a few entered under more formal or alternative names, mostly due to political and naming disputes. [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] entered as "'''F'''ormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia'" because of the [[Macedonia naming dispute|naming dispute with Greece]]. The [[Republic of China]] (commonly known as Taiwan) entered with the compromised [[Chinese Taipei|name]] and [[Chinese Taipei Olympic flag|flag]] of "Chinese '''T'''aipei" under T so that they did not enter together with [[Two Chinas|conflicting]] [[People's Republic of China]] (commonly known as China), which entered as the "People's Republic of '''C'''hina" under C. The [[Republic of the Congo]] entered as just "'''C'''ongo" while the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] entered under its former name, [[Zaire]]. [[Iran]], [[Republic of Moldova|Moldova]], [[Laos]], [[Brunei]] and the [[United States]] all entered under their formal names, respectively "Islamic Republic of '''I'''ran", "Republic of '''M'''oldova", "'''L'''ao People's Democratic Republic", "'''B'''runei Darussalam" and "'''U'''nited States of America".

A record of 197 nations entered the stadium with a combined total of 10,318 athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Longman|first=Jere|title=Atlanta 1996: The Games Begin; In Atlanta, Festivities Touched by Sorrow|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/19/sports/atlanta-1996-the-games-begin-in-atlanta-festivities-touched-by-sorrow.html|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=19 July 1996|accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-four nations made their Olympic debut, including eleven of the former Soviet republics, namely [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Moldova]], [[Russia]] (although it had been competed independently in [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912]] under the [[Russian Empire]]), [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Uzbekistan]], that had previously competed as part of the [[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team in 1992]]. [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] attended the Games independently for the first time since the breakup of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1993, whereas [[Cambodia]] returned officially after its 24-year absence under the [[Khmer Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fontaine|first=Chris|title=Pride of Cambodia strut Olympic stage|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/pride-cambodia-strut-olympic-stage|publisher=[[Phnom Penh Post]]|date=9 September 2000|accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2647">'''Abdelkader Guerroudj''' (born July 26, 1928 in [[Tlemcen]]), an Algerian, and his French wife, [[Jacqueline Netter-Minne-Guerroudj|Jacqueline Guerroudj]], were condemned to death in December 1957 as accomplices of [[Fernand Yveton|Fernand Iveton]], the only European who was guillotined for his part in the Algerian revolt. As a result of a high-profile campaign in France, where the issue was called ''L'Affaire Guerroudj'', neither was executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IfPxfEQpW38C&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26|title=Uncivil War: Intellectuals and Identity Politics During the Decolonization|isbn=0-8122-3588-6|year=2001|author=[[James D. Le Sueur]] |publisher=Univ. of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guerroudj was a political officer of the  [[Algerian Communist Party]] who liaised between the Communist  [[Combattants de la Libération]] and the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nous sommes tous des assassins|journal=[[Les Temps Modernes]]|issue=145|date=March 1958|pages=1574–1576|author=[[Jean-Paul Sartre]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FItC2Hr7ZMsC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62|title=Colonialism and Neocolonialism |isbn= 0-415-19145-9|year=2001|author=[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] |publisher=Routledge |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elwatan.com/spip.php?page=article&amp;id_article=13857|title=Journée du chahid |work=[[El Watan]]|date=2005-02-19|author=[[Reda Bekkat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His stepdaughter, [[Danièle Djamila Amrane-Minne|Danièle Minne]], was sentenced, on 4 December 1957, to 7 years in prison for her part in the revolt.

A declaration made by Guerroudj to the court is sometimes cited as showing that some pro-independence Algerian activists nevertheless hoped for close relations with France after independence:

"I am sure that we will need material, technicians, doctors and professors to construct our country; it is to France which we address ourselves first. I believe that would be in the true interest of both of our countries. It is not in the interest of France to have valets ready at every moment here to run to the call of the most powerful master, but friends who have freely consented to this friendship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Déclaration d'Abdelkader Guerroudj au début de procès|journal=[[Les Temps Modernes]]|issue=145|date=March 1958|pages=1564–74|author=Abdelkader Guerroudj}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ShunsenAzukiarai.jpg|thumb|160px|right|The ''azukiarai'' as depicted in Takehara Shunsen's [[Ehon Hyaku Monogatari]].]]
{{nihongo|'''Azukiarai'''|小豆洗い, ''azuki bean washing''}}, or {{nihongo|'''Azukitogi'''|小豆とぎ, ''azuki bean grinding''}}, is a ghostly phenomenon in [[Japanese folklore]], in which a mysterious noise that sounds like [[azuki bean]]s being washed or ground is heard. It usually occurs near a river or other body of water. Sometimes the creature or spirit responsible amuses itself by singing "''azuki togou ka, hito totte kuou ka? shoki shoki.''" ("Will I grind my azuki beans, or will I get a person to eat? ''shoki shoki''."), and anyone who approaches will inevitably fall into the water. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

While the perpetrator is seldom seen, he is often described as a short-statured man of grotesque appearance with a large balding head, crooked teeth, thin moustache, large bulging yellow eyes, wearing ragged clothes and bent over a pail washing ''azuki'' beans. ''Azukiarai'' is sometimes blamed on a [[raccoon dog]] or [[weasel]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

'''Batna''' ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;باتنة&lt;/big&gt;}}) is the main city of [[Batna Province]], [[Algeria]]. With a population of 290,645 (2008 census)&lt;ref name="census2008"&gt;{{cite web|title=Population: Batna Wilaya |url=http://www.ons.dz/collections/w05_p1.pdf |publisher=Office National des Statistiques Algérie |accessdate=3 March 2013 |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527081657/http://www.ons.dz/collections/w05_p1.pdf |archivedate=27 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the fifth largest city in Algeria. It is also one of the principal cities of the [[Chaoui]] area and is considered the capital of the [[Aures]].

==History==
:''See also: Timeline of Batna ([[:fr:Chronologie de la ville de Batna|fr]])''

The first solid foundations (a military encampment) of the city were erected by a French garrison in 1844, with a strategic mission to create a permanently guarded access point for the main Sahara road.

Batna's geographical location offers a natural break through the [[Atlas Mountains]]. The Romans did not detect this passage in their early invasion phase.

The ancient cities of [[Timgad]] and [[Lambese]], built around the first century CE, are living examples of the importance that the Romans gave to commercial control over the region.

=== Signature and proclamation of the Algerian revolution Batna===
[[File:L'APC de Batna.JPG|thumb|left|The Municipal People's Assembly]]
[[File:Martyrs' Square Batna 22.jpg|thumb|Martyrs' Square of Batna]]
The inhabitants of the city revolted  against the French authorities at the beginning of colonization. Thereafter they organized the Algerian revolution against French colonialism.

The first Batneens adhered to [[Messali Hadj]] (PPP), as did the Ulemas [[Ben Badis]] and the Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Freedoms (MTLD), and together they organized the great historic summit of 22, June 25, 1954.

The Algerian revolution started at Batna under the chairmanship of Batnéen [[Mustapha Benboulaïd]] (FLN). Batna was the first military region of L '[[Algeria]] (zone 1) 1954 1962. 
On the night of November 1, 1954, the barracks of the city of Batna was attacked by the mujahedeen. 
Batna was the command headquarters of the Algerian revolution until independence.&lt;ref&gt;War in Algeria, Mohammmde Hardi, Benjamamin Stora edition Robert Laffont&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ben Nighthorse Campbell''' (born April 13, 1933) is an American politician who was a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[Colorado]] from 1993 until 2005. Campbell was a three-term [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from 1987 to 1993, when he was sworn into office as a Senator following his election on November 3, 1992.   Campbell also serves as one of forty-four members of the [[Council of Forty-four|Council of Chiefs]] of the [[Cheyenne|Northern Cheyenne]] Indian Tribe.

Originally a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Campbell [[party switching|switched]] to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] on March 3, 1995. Reelected in [[United States Senate election in Colorado, 1998|1998]], Campbell announced in March 2004 that he would not run for reelection to a third term in November of that year. He expressed interest in running for [[Governor of Colorado]] in 2006. However, on January 4, 2006, he announced that he would not enter the race. His Senate seat was won by Democrat [[Ken Salazar]] in the [[United States Senate election in Colorado, 2004|November 2004 election]]. He later became a lobbyist for the law and lobbying firm [[Holland &amp; Knight]] and afterward co-founded his own lobbying firm, Ben Nighthorse Consultants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legaltimes.typepad.com/blt/2012/07/ben-nighthorse-campbell-and-associate-leave-holland-knight-to-start-own-lobbying-shop.html|title=Ben Nighthorse Campbell Leaves Holland &amp; Knight to Start Own Lobbying Shop|publisher=|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:US Navy 071215-N-7504C-001 Ben Nighthorse Campbell, former U.S. Senator from the state of Colorado, delivers remarks at the commissioning ceremony for USS Mesa Verde (LPD 19).jpg|thumb|left|Campbell speaks at the commissioning of the [[USS Mesa Verde|USS ''Mesa Verde'']] (LPD 19) in 2007]]
Campbell was born '''Benny Campbell'''&lt;ref&gt;According to the State of California. ''California Birth Index, 1905-1995''. Center for Health Statistics, California Department of Health Services, Sacramento, California. [http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/39461 Familytreelegends.com]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Auburn, California]]. His mother, Mary Vierra (Vieira), was a [[Portuguese Americans|Portuguese]] immigrant who had come with her mother to the U.S. at age six through Ellis Island, (according to Campbell, his maternal grandfather had entered the United States some time before.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/1690263/detail.html|title=INS Delays Deporting Honor Student|date=September 27, 2002|publisher=|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vierra family settled in the large Portuguese community near [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. When Mary Vierra contracted [[tuberculosis]] in her youth, she was forced to convalesce at a nearby hospital, often for months at a time during treatment. It was there that she met an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] patient Albert Campbell, who was at the hospital for [[alcoholism]] treatment. Albert Campbell was of predominantly [[Northern Cheyenne]] descent but, according to Nighthorse Campbell biographer [[Herman Viola]], Albert Campbell spent much of his youth in [[Crow Agency]] [[boarding school]] and may have had some [[Pueblo Indian]] and [[Apache]] Indian blood in his background as well. The couple married in 1929, and Campbell was born in 1933.

During Campbell's childhood, his father continued to have problems with alcoholism, often leaving the family for weeks and months at a time. His mother continued to have health problems with [[tuberculosis]], a highly contagious disease that limited the contact she could have with her children and continued to force her into the hospital for long periods of time. These problems led to Ben and his older sister Alberta (who died in an apparent suicide at age 44) spending much of their early lives in nearby Catholic [[orphanage]]s. As a young man, Campbell was introduced to the Japanese martial art of judo by Japanese immigrant families he met while working in local agricultural fields.

==Military service and education==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BenNighthorseCampbell.png|thumb|right|Senator Ben Campbell of Colorado speaking at the White House, 2004.]] --&gt;
Campbell attended [[Placer High School]], dropping out in 1951 to join the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]. He was stationed in [[Korea]] during the [[Korean War]] as an air policeman; he left the Air Force in 1953 with the rank of Airman Second Class, as well as the [[Korean Service Medal]] and the [[Air Medal]]. While in the Air Force, Campbell obtained his GED and, following his discharge, used his G.I. Bill to attend [[San Jose State University]], where he graduated in 1957 with a Bachelor of Arts in Physical Education and Fine Arts.

He is listed as ''Ben M. Campbell'' in his college records and records of his Olympic competition, but was given the name "Nighthorse" when he returned to the Northern Cheyenne reservation for his name-giving ceremony, as a member of his father's family, Blackhorse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1964/or1964v1pt2.pdf 1964 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 2. Part 2. p. 620&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ca/ben-campbell-1.html Sports-reference.com profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103225951/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ca/ben-campbell-1.html |date=November 3, 2012 }} (Listed as Ben Campbell). Accessed October 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
While in college, Campbell was a member of the San Jose State judo team, coached by future USA Olympic coach [[Yosh Uchida]]. While training for the Olympic Games, Campbell attended Meiji University in Tokyo, Japan as a special research student from 1960-1964. The Meiji team was world-renowned and Campbell credited the preparation and discipline taught at Meiji for his 1961, 1962, and 1963 U.S. National titles and his gold medal in the 1963 Pan-American Games. In 1964, Campbell competed in [[judo at the 1964 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo. He suffered an injury and did not win a medal. He broke his ankle and was out for two years.

In the years after returning from the Olympic Games, Campbell worked as a deputy sheriff in [[Sacramento County, California]], coached the U.S. National Judo Team, operated his own dojo in Sacramento, and taught high school (physical education and art classes). He and his wife also raised quarterhorses, including a Supreme Champion and AQHA Champion, "Sailors Night". They bought a ranch near [[Ignacio, Colorado]] on the Southern Ute reservation in 1978.

==Jewelry career==
In the book ''Ben Nighthorse Campbell: An American Warrior'', by Herman Viola, Campbell tells of learning to make jewelry from his father and flattening silver dollars on train tracks for the materials. He also used techniques learned from sword makers in Japan and other non-traditional techniques to win over 200 national and international awards for jewelry design under the name, "Ben Nighthorse" and was included in a feature article in the late 1970s in ''Arizona Highways'' magazine about Native artists experimenting in the 'new look' of Indian jewelry.
Campbell has works on display with the [[Art of the Olympians]] organization.&lt;ref name="AOTO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artoftheolympians.org/artists/ben-nighthorse-campbell-2 |title=Ben Nighthorse Campbell / Judo / Jewelry |publisher=Art of the Olympians |accessdate=February 21, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221011304/http://artoftheolympians.org/artists/ben-nighthorse-campbell-2/ |archivedate=February 21, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

[[File:George W. Bush greets Benjamin Nighthorse Campbell.jpg|thumb|right|Campbell with [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] in 2004]]
Campbell was elected to the Colorado State Legislature as a Democrat in November 1982, where he served two terms. He was voted one of the 10 Best Legislators by his colleagues in a 1986 ''Denver Post'' – News Center 4 survey. Campbell was elected in 1986 to the US House of Representatives, defeating incumbent Congressman Mike Strang; he was re-elected twice to this seat. In 1989, he authored the bill HR 2668 to establish the National Museum of the American Indian, which became PL 101-185.

The early 1990s marked a turning point in Campbell's political career. In 1992, following the announced retirement of Senator Tim Wirth, Campbell won a three-way Democratic primary with former three-term Governor [[Richard Lamm]] and Boulder County Commissioner Josie Heath, who had been the party's nominee in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/12/us/the-1992-campaign-3-democrats-to-run-for-senate-in-colorado.html|title=3 Democrats to Run for Senate in Colorado|date=April 12, 1992|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=August 1, 2016|via=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the primary campaign, Lamm supporters accused Heath of "spoiling" the election by splitting the vote of the party's left wing. Heath's campaign pointed out that it was Campbell who should not have been running because his voting record in Congress had been much more like that of a Republican.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Campbell won the primary with 45% of the vote and then defeated Republican State Senator [[Terry Considine]] in the general election.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} As a Democrat, Campbell was the first Native American elected to serve in the [[United States Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/11/01/Democrats-geared-to-retain-Senate-control-1550PARA/6192720594000/|title=Democrats geared to retain Senate control (1,550)PARA:|work=UPI|access-date=May 19, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1995, after two years in office, Senator Campbell switched parties from Democratic to Republican in the wake of publicized disputes he had with the [[Colorado Democratic Party]]. The Senator said that the final straw for him was the Senate's defeat of the balanced-budget amendment, which he has championed since coming to Washington as a congressman in 1987.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}  Others attributed the switch to personal hostility within the Democratic Party in Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/04/us/democrats-lose-senate-seat-with-switch-by-coloradan.html|title=Democrats Lose Senate Seat With Switch by Coloradan|date=March 4, 1995|work=The New York Times|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Campbell won re-election to the Senate by what was then the largest margin in Colorado history for a statewide race. After winning re-election, Campbell identified as a [[Rockefeller Republican|moderate Republican]] saying that &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;[his re-election] shows the moderate voices within the Republican Party are dominating.&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/13/us/gop-senator-sees-victory-in-colorado-as-signal-to-moderates.html|title=G.O.P.

During his tenure, Campbell also became the first American Indian to chair the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. He retired from office in January 2005.

The Senate ethics committee investigated accusations that his former chief of staff inflated bonuses to an aide in 2002 so he could return the money to the chief of staff. In subsequent interviews, the chief of staff and aide both asserted that Campbell had approved of the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Janofsky|first1=Michael|title=G.O.P.

After his retirement, Campbell was a senior policy advisor at the firm of Holland and Knight, LLP in Washington, DC.  In July 2012, he left that firm to found Ben Nighthorse Consultants, a new lobbying firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ben Nighthorse Campbell Leaves Holland &amp; Knight to Start Own Lobbying Shop|url=http://legaltimes.typepad.com/blt/2012/07/ben-nighthorse-campbell-and-associate-leave-holland-knight-to-start-own-lobbying-shop.html|publisher=Durango Herald|accessdate=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lobbying World|url=http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/238519-lobbying-world-|publisher=The Hill|accessdate=August 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also continues to design and craft his Ben Nighthorse line of American Indian jewelry.

Completed in 2011, [[Lake Nighthorse]], a 120,000-acre-foot reservoir in southwestern Colorado, is named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lake Nighthorse reaches capacity|url=http://www.durangoherald.com/article/20110701/NEWS01/707019922/Lake-Nighthorse-reaches-capacity|publisher=Durango Herald|accessdate=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of [[Issue One]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.issueone.org/reformers/ |title=ReFormers Caucus |publisher=Issue One |date= |accessdate=October 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
In 1966, Campbell married the former Linda Price, a [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] teacher who was a native of Colorado. The couple have two married children, Colin (Karen) Campbell and Shanan (John) Wells. They have four grandchildren. The Campbells still reside in Colorado.

Linda Campbell was the sponsor of [[USS Mesa Verde|USS ''Mesa Verde'']] (LPD 19) on January 15, 2005.

'''Binyamin Arditi''' ({{lang-he|בנימין ארדיטי}}, 1 July 1897 &amp;ndash; 20 May 1981) was an [[Israel]]i politician who served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for [[Herut]] and [[Gahal]] between 1955 and 1965.

==Biography==
Born in [[Vienna]], Arditi attended high school in [[Sofia]] in [[Bulgaria]]. In 1917 he became a member of the central committee of the [[World Zionist Organization|Zionist Organization of Bulgaria]], on which he remained until 1923. He also chaired the organisation's Sofia branch. In 1925 he established the first Bulgarian [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist Zionist]] movement, which he chaired until 1935.

In 1944 he was arrested for Zionist activities, and two years later was arrested again by the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|communist authorities]] for encouraging [[aliyah|emigration to Palestine]]. Between 1947 and 1949 he served as the Revisionst Zionism representative in the Bulgarian [[Eretz Yisrael Office]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mk_eng.asp?mk_individual_id_t=271 Binyamin Arditi: Public Activities] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 he made [[aliyah]] to Israel, where he became a member of the Herut central committee. In [[Israeli legislative election, 1955|1955]] he was elected to the Knesset on the party's list, and was re-elected in [[Israeli legislative election, 1959|1959]] and [[Israeli legislative election, 1961|1961]], before losing his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1965|1965 elections]].

Arditi also published several books; ''The Role of King Boris in the Expulsion of Bulgarian Jewry'' (1952), ''Bulgarian Jews Under the Nazis'' (1962), ''Bulgarian Jewry – the Sumla Community'' (1968) and ''Famous Bulgarian Jews'' (1971).

He died in 1981 at the age of 83.

'''Christopher John Llewellyn Rogers''' (born 31 August 1977) is a former Australian [[cricket]]er who played for [[Australia national cricket team|Australian national team]]. Rogers is a left-handed [[Batting order (cricket)#Opening batsman or openers|opening batsman]]. He spent ten years playing for [[Western Australian cricket team|Western Australia]], before moving to play for [[Victoria cricket team|Victoria]] in 2008.  He has played [[county cricket]] in England for the past ten years for five first-class teams [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]], [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]], [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]], [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] and [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]].

Despite being [[colour blind]]&lt;ref name=CR1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/07/chris-rogers-pink-ball-colour-blind|title=Colour-blind Chris Rogers forced to pull out of pink ball trial match|publisher=Guardian|date=7 November 2014|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[short sightedness|short sighted]], he maintained a [[First-class cricket|first-class]] [[Batting average (cricket)|average]] of nearly 50, yet he did not play for the [[Australia national cricket team]] until the age of 30, when he was selected for a single [[Test cricket|Test match]] in 2008. He was recalled to the Australia national team for the [[2013 Ashes series]], aged 35, and over the following two years played a further 24 Tests opening the batting for Australia before retiring after the [[2015 Ashes series]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/the-ashes-2015/content/story/910593.html Why Australia will miss Chris Rogers]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Born in [[St George, New South Wales|St George, Sydney]], Rogers' father, John Rogers played for New South Wales between 1969 and 1970. He is also a cousin of Australian [[chess]] grandmaster [[Ian Rogers (chess player)|Ian Rogers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/sports-news/OtherSports/For-this-couple-chess-is-a-game-for-life/Article1-1152246.aspx For this couple, chess is a game for life], [[Hindustan Times]], 17 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers made one Youth Test match appearance, against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] in 1996.  Rogers' batting talent had led some to anoint him as the next Australian opener, replacing [[Justin Langer]].&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,23060095-23212,00.html|title=Hayden sledge spurred Rogers|work=foxsports.com.au|date=2008-01-16|accessdate=2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic career==

He first came to England in 1996 to play in the [[Devon Cricket League]] for North Devon CC under the watchful eye of former Gloucestershire player and Test match umpire [[David Shepherd (umpire)|David Shepherd]]. He came back the following year to score a league record aggregate of 1,273 runs but could not save the Instow Club from relegation.

In 2002 he played for Exeter, also in the Devon League, and in 2003 he returned to England once again to play for Wellington CC in the Shropshire League The welter of runs he contributed saw them move from the Furrow's Shropshire League to the Birmingham League where they were again promoted. He was unable to play Minor Counties cricket but did make one appearance for Shropshire in the Nat West Trophy where overseas players were allowed, but made a duck in his only game.

He made his first trip into English First Class cricket playing for [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] in 2004, where despite suffering from a shoulder injury, played well. He moved to [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]] in the second half of the 2005 season, where he averaged over 70, and scored one double-century against the touring Australians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/cricket/aussie-hits-double-century-against-pontings-men/2005/07/18/1121538888624.html ''Aussie hits double century against Ponting's men''] Sydney Morning Herald. Retrieved on 15 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 he moved to [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]] and immediately made his mark with fifty fours, two sixes, and a final score of 319 from 417 balls against Gloucestershire.

In October 2006 he and [[Marcus North]] put on a record domestic third wicket partnership of 459, Western Australia v Victoria, at the [[WACA Ground|WACA]]. Rogers' score of 279 was the second highest ever by a West Australian, behind the 355 [[not out]] that [[Geoff Marsh]] scored at the same ground in December 1989.  On 5 February 2007 Rogers was awarded the 'State Cricket Player of the Year' prize at the [[Allan Border Medal]] presentation.

He returned to Derbyshire for the 2008 season,&lt;ref name=sack/&gt; playing as their overseas player when [[Mahela Jayawardene]] declared himself unavailable due to his commitments with [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lanka]] and the [[Indian Premier League]], and has since become the temporary captain after the resignation of [[Rikki Clarke]]. Despite being both short-sighted and [[colourblind]] (a fact that was said to put him at a bigger disadvantage when using the pink ball for the first [[day-night test]] against New Zealand at the [[Adelaide Oval]]),&lt;ref name=fox /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Day-night Test: Mitchell Starc launches scathing attack on pink ball, new format|url = http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/the-ashes/day-night-test-mitchell-starc-launches-scathing-attack-on-pink-ball-new-format/story-e6frf3gl-1227422358374|accessdate = 2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers has proven himself to be a sharp player both at and away from the crease. Rogers has also played for [[Shropshire County Cricket Club|Shropshire]], representing them during one match of the [[C&amp;G Trophy]].
In 2008, he walked out on the Western Warriors, reportedly over his status as a fringe-player in the state's one-day team, and joined [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] for the 2008/2009 season.&lt;ref name=sack/&gt;

In 2008, Rogers hit 248 not out, carrying his bat for Derbyshire against [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]]. The score is the third-highest single-innings total in a first-class match by a Derbyshire player, and the highest score for 62 years.

In 2010, after relinquishing the Derbyshire captaincy to [[Greg Smith (cricketer, born 1983)|Greg Smith]], Rogers joined Middlesex for the 2011 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/derbyshire/content/story/475155.html |title=Rogers leaving Derbyshire to join Middlesex |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=23 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was appointed captain of the first-class County Championship side in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/20009396 |title=Neil Dexter and Chris Rogers to share Middlesex captaincy |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 October 2012 |accessdate=23 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==

In May 2007, Rogers was awarded his first national contract with [[Cricket Australia]].&lt;ref name=contract&gt;[http://content-www.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/292941.html ''Gillespie keeps his contract'']; [[Cricinfo]]; 2007-05-01. Retrieved on 2008-04-29.&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 January 2008, he was added to the Australia Test squad as a cover for the injured [[Matthew Hayden]], who had torn a [[hamstring]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/7184616.stm |title=Rogers added as cover for Hayden |work=[[BBC Sport]] |publisher=BBC |date=13 January 2008 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he made his Test debut in the third Test against India at the [[WACA Ground]] on 16 January, but the Baggy Green had to be replaced a day later because Rogers' cap was too small, and he unsuccessfully tried to make it bigger to alleviate headaches caused by fielding all day in the scorching heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/7184616.stm |title=Rogers set for Australian debut |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=15 January 2008 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia were chasing a world-record 17th consecutive Test victory, but found the going difficult. Rogers scored four runs in the first innings of 212 and 15 in the second innings as Australia unsuccessfully chased a target of over 400.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/7195454.stm |title=India dent Australia record hopes |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=18 January 2008 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His national contract was subsequently terminated in April 2008.&lt;ref name=sack&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/counties/derbyshire/7338734.stm |title=Rogers loses Australian contract |work=[[BBC Sport]] |publisher=BBC |date=9 April 2008 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers commented that he "didn't see it coming, I'll have to accept it and try to get back in."&lt;ref name=sack/&gt;

On 24 April 2013 and at age 35, Rogers was named in the 16-man Australian Test squad for the [[2013 Ashes tour]] in England, more than five years after his previous Test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rogers comes in from the cold|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-04-24/rogers-comes-in-from-the-cold/4649966?section=sport|publisher=ABC|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia name Brad Haddin as vice-captain for Ashes series|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/22264911|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opened the batting throughout the series, partnering initially with [[Shane Watson]] and later with [[David Warner (cricketer)|David Warner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/cricket/darren-lehmann-confirms-chris-rogers-will-open-in-first-ashes-test/story-fni2usfi-1226672831368 |title=Darren Lehmann confirms Chris Rogers will open batting for Australia in first Ashes Test  |work=Herald Sun |author=Conn, Malcolm |accessdate= 22 June 2014 |date=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made 367 runs at 40.77 for the series to be Australia's third-highest scorer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/the-ashes-2013/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=7362;team=2;type=series|title=The Ashes, 2013 – Australia, Records, Batting and Bowling averages|publisher=ESPN Cricinfo|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers scored his [[List of Australia Test cricket centurions|maiden Test century]] in the first innings of the fourth Test, in difficult seaming conditions at the [[Riverside Ground|Riverside International Cricket Ground]], Durham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/the-ashes-2013/content/story/661051.html|title=Rogers' maiden ton does job for Australia|author=Daniel Brettig|publisher=ESPN Cricinfo|accessdate=22 August 2015|date=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his success in England, Rogers held his place as an opening batsman for the next two years. In the return [[2013–14 Ashes series|Ashes series]] in the 2013/14 summer, Rogers scored 463 runs at 46.30 to again be Australia's third-highest scorer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/the-ashes-2013-14/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=7899;team=2;type=series|title= The Ashes, 2013/14 – Australia / Records / Batting and bowling averages|accessdate=22 August 2015|publisher=ESPN Cricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his second Test century, and his first on Australian soil, in Australia's successful fourth-innings run-chase in the [[Boxing Day Test]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]],&lt;ref name="ESPN Cricinfo - 26–29 December 2013 - England tour of Australia, 2013/14 – Australia v England"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/the-ashes-2013-14/engine/match/592400.html|title= England tour of Australia, 2013/14 – Australia v England Scorecard|date=29 December 2013|publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he backed that up with his third Test century in the second innings of the New Year's Test at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] with a score of 119.&lt;ref name="ESPN Cricinfo - 3–5 January 2014 - England tour of Australia, 2013/14 – Australia v England"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/the-ashes-2013-14/engine/match/592401.html|title= England tour of Australia, 2013/14 – Australia v England Scorecard|date=5 January 2014|publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then scored a rearguard century of 107 against South Africa in the second innings of the second Test in Port Elizabeth in February 2014,&lt;ref name="ESPN Cricinfo - 20–23 February 2014 - Australia tour of South Africa, 2013/14 – South Africa v Australia"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/south-africa-v-australia-2013-14/engine/match/648675.html|title= Australia tour of South Africa, 2013/14 – South Africa v Australia Scorecard|date=23 February 2014|publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was his only score above 50 in the series where he averaged 30.16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=8275;team=2;type=series|title= Records / Australia in South Africa Test Series, 2013/14 – Australia / Batting and bowling averages|accessdate=22 August 2015|publisher=ESPN Cricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt; A two-Test series in the [[UAE]] against Pakistan in late 2014 was the leanest of Rogers' career, managing only 88 runs at 22.00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=9101;team=2;type=series|title= Records / Pakistan v Australia Test Series, 2014/15 – Australia / Batting and bowling averages|publisher=ESPN Cricinfo|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers returned to form during the 2014/15 summer, scoring 417 runs at 52.12 in the four-Test home series against India. He failed to score a century in the series, but managed consecutive half-centuries over his last six innings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia-v-india-2014-15/engine/match/754743.html |title=Scorecard: 4th Test: Australia v. India at Sydney, 6–10 January 2015 |publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He toured with Australia in its [[Australian cricket team in the West Indies in 2015|2015 tour of the West Indies]], but missed both matches with concussion after being struck in the head during a net session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-02/chris-rogers-out-of-first-test-against-west-indies-with-concuss/6513546|title=Chris Rogers ruled out of first Test against West Indies after suffering concussion in nets training|accessdate=22 August 2015|date=2 June 2015|publisher=ABC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers returned from his concussion the following month for the [[2015 Ashes series]] in England, which he had announced before the tour would be his last before retiring from international cricket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricket.com.au/news/opening-batsman-chris-rogers-announces-test-retirement-australia-post-ashes/2015-05-18|title=Rogers set to retire after Ashes series|date=18 May 2015|accessdate=22 August 2015|publisher=Cricket Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He extended his sequence of consecutive Test half-centuries to a record-equalling seven innings in the first Test at Cardiff, before being dismissed for ten in the second innings. He batted through the entire first day on his way to the highest score of his Test career (173) in the first innings of the second Test at [[Lord's]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/the-ashes-2015/engine/match/743965.html Australia tour of England and Ireland, 2nd Investec Test: England v Australia at Lord's, Jul 16–20, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; and made an unbeaten 49 before retiring hurt in the second innings after suffering a dizzy spell. He finished the series with 480 runs at 60.00, the highest average across both teams, and was awarded Australian Player of the Series.

Despite a relatively short career of 25 Tests, Rogers retired having gained admiration for his watchful, consistent batting at the top of the order; in particular, during the two Ashes series he played in England, he was one of Australia's most consistent batsmen in the seaming and swinging conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2015/07/17/chris-rogers-way/|title=Chris Rogers does it his way|author=Glenn Mitchell|date=17 July 2015|accessdate=25 August 2015|publisher=The Roar}}&lt;/ref&gt; For all but the first few Tests of his international career, he formed a successful opening partnership with [[David Warner (cricketer)|David Warner]], generally playing an anchoring role to Warner's more aggressive style; in only 41 innings together, the pair shared nine century partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Queensland Times|date=21 August 2015|author=Stephen Brenkley|title=Michael Clarke quickly dismissed in final Ashes test|accessdate=25 August 2015|url=http://www.qt.com.au/news/michael-clarke-quickly-dismissed-final-ashes-test/2748061/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers received a belated sendoff at the 2015 Boxing Day Test where he rode a lap of honour around the MCG and received a mushroom stand to rest his Baggy Green cap.

'''Costa Ricans''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: '''''Costarricenses'''''), also called '''[[Tico]]s''', are a group of peoples from a multiethnic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2014/08/28/lawmakers-vote-to-define-costa-rica-as-a-multiethnic-plurinational-country|title=Lawmakers vote to define Costa Rica as a multiethnic, plurinational country|work=The Tico Times|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Costa-Rica-Declared-Pluricultural-and-Multiethnic-Country-20140828-0060.html|title=Costa Rica Declared Pluricultural and Multiethnic Country|first=teleSUR /|last=gf-LB|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speaking [[nation]] in [[Central America]] called [[Costa Rica]]. Costa Ricans are predominantly [[Criollo people|whites]], [[castizo]]s (halfway between white and mestizo) and [[mestizo]], but their country is considered a multiethnic society, which means that it is home to people of many different ethnic backgrounds. As a result, modern-day Costa Ricans do not consider their nationality as an ethnicity but as a citizenship with various ethnicities. Costa Rica has four small minority groups: Mulattoes, Blacks, Asians, and Amerindians. In addition to the "Indigenas", whites, mestizos, blacks and mulattoes, Costa Rica is also home to thousands of Asians. Most of the Chinese and Indians now living in the country are descendants of those that arrived during the 19th century as migrant workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelwizard.com/centralamerica/costa-rica-vacations/culture/|title=Luxury Centralamerica Culture packages - Travelwizard|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2011 Census, Costa Rica has a population of 4,301,712 people. The population growth rate between 2005 and 2010 was estimated to be 1.5% annually, with a birth rate of 17.8 live births per 1,000 inhabitants and a mortality rate of 4.1 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants. By 2016, the population had increased to about 4.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldscapitalcities.com/capital-facts-for-san-jose-costa-rica/|title=Capital Facts for San José, Costa Rica|date=20 July 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Costa Rica was the point where the [[Mesoamerica]]n and South American native cultures met. The northwest of the country, the Nicoya peninsula, was the southernmost point of [[Nahuatl]] cultural influence when the Spanish conquerors ([[conquistadores]]) came in the 16th century. The central and southern portions of the country had [[Chibcha]] influences. The Atlantic coast, meanwhile, was populated with Jamaican immigrant workers during the 19th century. The country has received immigration from [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Americas]], [[Middle East]] etc. The inmigration received from Nicaragua and the rest of Central America during the last century can be perceived nowadays in every corner of the country

==History==
[[File:Political divisions of Mexico 1821 (location map scheme).svg|thumb|Costa Rica was one of the relatively more isolated populations of the [[New Spain]]]]
[[File:Familia campesina. Costa Rica. 1900.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Average Costa Rican Family - Early Twentieth Century.]]
The colonial period began when [[Christopher Columbus]] reached the eastern coast of Costa Rica on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|fourth voyage]] in 1502.  Numerous subsequent Spanish expeditions followed, eventually leading to the first Spanish colony, Villa Bruselas in Costa Rica in 1524.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guiascostarica.com/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501191704/http://www.guiascostarica.com/history.htm |archivedate=2013-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During most of the colonial period, Costa Rica was the southernmost province of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], which was nominally part of the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]] (i.e., [[Mexico]]), but which in practice operated as a largely autonomous entity within the [[Spanish Empire]]. Costa Rica's distance from the capital in [[Guatemala]], its legal prohibition under Spanish law to trade with its southern neighbors in [[Panama]], then part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] (i.e., [[Colombia]]), and the lack of resources such as [[gold]] and [[silver]], made Costa Rica into a poor, isolated, and sparsely inhabited region within the Spanish Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= A Brief History of Costa Rica: Colonial Times | url =http://www.horizontes.com/en/history.html | accessdate = 2007-12-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070922232020/http://www.horizontes.com/en/history.html |archivedate = September 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costa Rica was described as "the poorest and most miserable Spanish colony in all America" by a Spanish governor in 1719.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Shafer, D. Michael |title=Winners and losers: how sectors shape the developmental prospects of states |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y. |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-8014-8188-0 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important factor behind Costa Rica's poverty was the lack of a significant indigenous population available for [[Encomienda|forced labor]], which meant that most of the Costa Rican settlers had to work on their own land, preventing the establishment of large ''[[hacienda]]s''. For all these reasons Costa Rica was by and large unappreciated and overlooked by the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Crown]] and left to develop on its own.  The small landowners' relative poverty, the lack of a large indigenous labor force, the population's ethnic and linguistic homogeneity, and Costa Rica's isolation from the Spanish colonial centers in Mexico and the Andes all contributed to the development of an autonomous and individualistic agrarian society. Even the Governor had to farm his own crops and tend to his own garden due to the poverty that he lived in. An [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] tradition also arose.  Costa Rica became a "rural democracy" with no oppressed [[mestizo]] or indigenous class. It was not long before [[Spanish people|Spanish]] settlers turned to the hills, where they found rich volcanic soil and a milder [[climate]] than that of the lowlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.costarica.com/Destinations/Cities-and-Towns/Cartago/ |title=Costa Rica – Cartago |publisher=Costarica.com |date=2009-05-22 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of | 2012}} most Costa Ricans are primarily of Spanish ancestry with minorities of German, Nicaraguan, Italian, Jamaican, Colombian, Central American and Greek ancestry or mixed. 

European migrants used Costa Rica to get across the isthmus of Central America as well to reach the USA West Coast ([[California]]) in the late 19th century and until the 1910s (before the [[Panama Canal]] opened). Other ethnic groups known to live in Costa Rica include Venezuelans, Peruvian, Brazilians, Portuguese, [[Palestinians]], Caribbeans, Turks, Armenians and Georgians.

Many of the first Spanish colonists in Costa Rica may have been Jewish converts to [[Christianity]] who were expelled from Spain in 1492 and fled to colonial backwaters to avoid the Inquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/dje/articles2/costarica.htm|title=The Jewish Community in Costa Rica|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first sizable group of self-identified Jews immigrated from Poland, beginning in 1929. From the 1930s to the early 1950s, journalistic and official anti-Semitic campaigns fueled harassment of Jews; however, by the 1950s and 1960s, the immigrants won greater acceptance. Most of the 3,500 Costa Rican Jews today are not highly observant, but they remain largely endogamous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Costa-Rica.html|title=Culture of Costa Rica - history, people, women, beliefs, food, customs, family, social, marriage|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Costa Rica has four small minority groups: [[Mulatto]]s, [[Black people|Blacks]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] and [[Asians]]. About 8% of the population is of Black African descent or Mulatto (mix of European and black) who are called [[Afro-Costa Rican]]s, English-speaking descendants of 19th century black [[Jamaica]]n immigrant workers.

In 1873 the Atlantic Railroad imported 653 Chinese indentured laborers, hoping to duplicate the success of rail projects that used Chinese labor in Peru, Cuba, and the United States. Asians represent less than 0.5% of the Costa Rican population, mostly from China, Taiwan and Japan.

There are also over 104,000 [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] or indigenous inhabitants, representing 2.4% of the population. Most of them live in secluded reservations, distributed among eight ethnic groups: Quitirrisí (in the Central Valley), [[Matambú]] or [[Chorotega people|Chorotega]] (Guanacaste), [[Maleku people|Maleku]] (northern Alajuela), [[Bribri people|Bribri]] (southern Atlantic), [[Cabécar]] (Cordillera de Talamanca), [[Guaymí]] (southern Costa Rica, along the Panamá border), [[Boruca people|Boruca]] (southern Costa Rica) and [[Térraba]] (southern Costa Rica).

A considerable portion of the Costa Rican population is made up of [[Nicaragua]]ns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2019.htm www.state.gov]  Background Note: Costa Rica – People&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a number of [[Colombia]]n refugees. Moreover, Costa Rica took in lots of refugees from a range of other Latin American countries fleeing civil wars and dictatorships during the 1970s and 80s – notably from [[El Salvador]], [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], [[Cuba]] and recently from [[Venezuela]].

Currently immigrants represent 9% of the Costa Rican population, the largest in Central America and the Caribbean. By 2014 the three largest Immigrant Diasporas in [[Costa Rica]] are people from: [[Nicaragua]], [[Colombia]] and [[United States]].

==Population==

Approximately 40% live in rural areas and 60% in urban areas. The rate of urbanization estimated for the period 2005–2010 is 2.3% per annum,&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|author=Central Intelligence Agency|title=Costa Rica|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|location=Langley, Virginia|year=2011|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cs.html|accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the highest among [[developing country|developing countries]].

==Languages==

The primary language spoken in Costa Rica is Costa Rican Spanish, one of the main particularities of the Costa Rica Spanish is the usage of the second person singular pronoun ''vos (called [[voseo]]) or [[usted]]'' instead of ''tu''. Some native languages are still spoken in indigenous reservations. The most numerically important are the Bribri, Maléku, Cabécar and Ngäbere languages, some of which have several thousand speakers in Costa Rica – others a few hundred. Some languages, such as Teribe and Boruca, have fewer than a thousand speakers. A Creole-English language, Jamaican patois (also known as Mekatelyu), is spoken along the Caribbean coast. About 10.7% of Costa Rica's adult population (18 or older) also speaks English, 0.7% French, and 0.3% speaks Portuguese or German as a second language.  Mennonite immigrants to the country also speak Plautdietsch.

==Religion==
[[File:Basilica de los Angeles 2007.jpg|thumb|Basílica de Nuestra Señora de los Ángeles (Basilica of Our Lady of the Angels), during 2007 pilgrimage]]
{{Main|Religion in Costa Rica}}
Christianity is the predominant religion, and Roman Catholicism is the official [[state religion]] according to the 1949 Constitution, which at the same time guarantees freedom of religion.

According to the most recent nationwide survey of religion, conducted in 2007 by the University of Costa Rica, 70.5% of Costa Ricans are [[Roman Catholics]], 44.9% of the population are practicing Catholics, 13.8% are [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Protestants]], 11.3% report they do not have a religion, and 4.3% belonged to another.

Because of the recent small but continuous immigration from Asia and the Middle East, other religions have grown, the most popular being [[Buddhism]] (because of a growing [[Han Chinese]] community of 40,000), and smaller numbers of [[Hindu]], Jewish, [[Bahá’í]], and Muslim adherents.

The Sinagoga Shaarei Zion synagogue &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centroisraelita.com/ Centro Israelita de Costa Rica, Comunidad Judía de Costa Rica], Costa Rican Jewish Community&lt;/ref&gt; is near [[La Sabana Metropolitan Park]] in [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]]. Several homes in the neighborhood east of the park display the [[Star of David]] and other Jewish symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles2/costarica.htm |title=Jewish Community in Costa Rica |publisher=Jcpa.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons) claim more than 35,000 members, and has a temple in [[San José Costa Rica Temple|San Jose]] that served as a regional worship center for Costa Rica, Panama, Nicaragua, and Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/contact-us/costa-rica Costa Rica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825062417/http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/contact-us/costa-rica |date=2010-08-25 }}.

==Emigration and immigration==
[[File:Familia Peters.PNG|thumb|180px|Family of German immigrants in Costa Rica.]]
Costa Rica's emigration is the smallest in the [[Caribbean Basin]] and is among the smallest in the [[Americas]]. By 2015 about just 133,185 (2,77%) of the country's people live in another country as immigrants. The main destination countries are the [[United States]] (85,924), [[Nicaragua]] (10,772), [[Panama]] (7,760), [[Canada]] (5,039), [[Spain]] (3,339), [[Mexico]] (2,464), [[Germany]] (1,891), [[Italy]] (1,508), [[Guatemala]] (1,162) and [[Venezuela]] (1,127). &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datosmacro.com/demografia/migracion/emigracion/costa-rica Costa Rica - Emigrantes totales] (in spanish) Según los últimos datos publicados Costa Rica tiene 133.185 emigrantes, lo que supone un 2,77% de la población de Costa Rica. Si miramos el ranking de emigrantes vemos que tiene un porcentaje de emigrantes medio, ya que está en el puesto 44º de los 195 del ranking de emigrantes.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, there were 127,061 Costa Ricans living in another country as immigrants. [[Remittance]]s were $513,000,000 in 2006 and they represented 2.3% of the country's GDP.

Costa Rica's immigration is among the largest in the Caribbean Basin. Immigrants in Costa Rica represent about 10.2% of the Costa Rican population. The main countries of origin are [[Nicaragua]], [[Colombia]], [[United States]] and [[El Salvador]]. In 2005, there were 440,957 people in the country living as immigrants. Outward Remittances were $246,000,000 in 2006.

'''Dahmane El Harrachi'''  (real name '''Abderrahmane Amrani'''), (July 7, 1926 &amp;ndash; August 31, 1980), was an Algerian [[Chaabi (Algeria)|Chaâbi]] singer of [[Chaoui]] origin. His song [[Ya Rayah]] made him the best exported and most translated Chaabi artist.&lt;ref name="Zerarka 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Zerarka | first=Youssef | title=Dahmane El Harrachi, "toujours vivant", 35 ans après la mort | website=Al Huffington Post | date=31 Aug 2015 | url=http://www.huffpostmaghreb.com/2015/08/31/dahmane-el-harrachi_n_8064776.html | language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to France in 1949 living in [[Lille]], then [[Marseille]], before eventually settling in [[Paris]]. It was in Paris where he made a name for himself, playing in the numerous Algerian cafés there.

He died on August 31, 1980 in a car accident on the highway in [[Algiers]]. He is buried at the [[El Kettar Cemetery]].

==Personal==
His father, originally from the [[Chaoui]] village of [[Djellal]] in  the province of [[Khenchela Province|Khenchla]], was the [[Muaddin]] at the [[Great Mosque of Algiers]].

In 2009, his son [[Kamel El Harrachi]] issued a hommage CD to his father, titled "Ghana Fenou".

[[File:Max Slevogt Francisco d'Andrade as Don Giovanni.jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait of [[Francisco D'Andrade]] as Don Juan in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' by [[Max Slevogt]], 1912]]
'''Don Juan''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{IPA-es|doɴˈχwan|pron}}), also '''Don Giovanni''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]), is a legendary, fictional [[libertine]]. The first written version of the ''Don Juan'' legend was written by the Spanish dramatist [[Tirso de Molina]] (''[[pen name|nom de plume]]'' of [[Gabriel Téllez]]).&lt;ref name="Waxman,Samuel"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waxman |first=Samuel M. |title=The Don Juan Legend in Literature |journal=[[Journal of American Folklore]] |volume=21 |issue=81 |date=1908 |pages=184–204 |jstor=534636}}&lt;/ref&gt; His play, ''[[The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest|El burlador de Sevilla y convidado de piedra]]'' (''The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest''), was set in the fourteenth century and published in [[Spain]] around 1630. The name "Don Juan" is a common metaphor for a [[wikt:womanizer|womanizer]].

==Purpose==
The original play was written in the [[Spanish Golden Age]] according to its beliefs and ideals, but as the story was translated and time passed, the story was adapted to accommodate cultural changes.&lt;ref name="Waxman,Samuel" /&gt;

Tirso de Molina wrote ''El burlador de Sevilla'' in 1630 in order to demonstrate a life-changing lesson. He saw that everyone was throwing his life away, living and sinning as they pleased, because they believed that in the end, as long as they repented before they died, they would receive the grace to enter heaven. However, through his play, he shows that even Don Juan, who is identified as the very [[devil]], a "man without a name" and shapeshifter, has to eventually pay for his [[sin]]s. Tirso reminds us that we must pay for our actions, and that in the end, [[Danse Macabre|death makes us all equal]].&lt;ref name="Momentos cumbres"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodríguez |first=Rodney |year=2004 |chapter=La comedia del Siglo de Oro |title=Momentos cumbres de las literaturas hispánicas |language=Spanish |isbn=9780131401327 |location=Upper Saddle River |publisher=Prentice Hall |pages=262–318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
Although the various iterations of the Don Juan myth show some variation, the basic story remains the same. Starting with Tirso's work, Don Juan is portrayed as a wealthy libertine who devotes his life to [[seduction|seducing]] women, taking great pride in his ability to seduce women of all ages and stations in life.

"Tan largo me lo fiáis" (translated as "What a long term you are giving me!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wade |first=Gerald E. |last2= |first2= |date=December 1964 |title="El Burlador de Sevilla": Some Annotations  |jstor=336326 |journal=Hispania |publisher=American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=751 |doi=10.2307/336326  }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the aphorism that Don Juan lives by. It is his way of indicating that he is young and death is still distant, trusting he has plenty of time to repent for his sins.&lt;ref name="Momentos cumbres" /&gt;

His life is also punctuated with violence and gambling, and in many interpretations (Tirso, Espronceda, Zorrilla), he kills Don Gonzalo, the father of a girl he has seduced, Doña Ana. This leads to the famous last supper scene, whereby Don Juan invites the statue of the father to dinner. The ending depends on which version of the legend one is reading. Tirso's original play was meant as religious [[parable]] against Don Juan's sinful ways, and ends with his death, having been denied salvation by God. Other authors and playwrights would interpret the ending in their own fashion. In Da Ponte's libretto for ''Don Giovanni'', he repeatedly refuses to repent despite being given the opportunity by the statue. Espronceda's Don Felix walks into hell and to his death of his own volition, whereas Zorrilla's Don Juan asks for, and receives, a divine pardon. The figure of Don Juan has inspired many modern interpretations.

==Cultural impact==
[[Albert Camus]] utilizes Don Juan as a character to portray certain ideas. In ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'', Camus describes Don Juan as an example of an 'absurd hero', as he  maintains a reckless abandon in his approach to love. His seductive lifestyle "brings with it all the faces in the world, and its tremor comes from the fact that it knows itself to be mortal". He "multiplies what he cannot unify... It is his way of giving and vivifying".&lt;ref&gt;Albert Camus, ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'', "The Absurd Man: Don Juanism"&lt;/ref&gt; 

Don Juan also fascinated [[Jane Austen]]: "I have seen nobody on the stage who has been a more interesting Character than that compound of Cruelty and Lust".&lt;ref&gt;D. Le Faye ed., ''Jane Austen's Letters'' (1996) p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; In a famous passage, [[Kierkegaard]] discusses Mozart's version of the Don Juan story.&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Either/Or'', "The Immediate Stages of the Erotic, or Musical Erotic."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Rosen]] saw what he called "the seductive physical power" of [[Mozart]]'s music as linked to 18th century [[libertine|libertinism]], political fervor, and incipient [[Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Rosen, ''The Classical Style'' (1977) p. 323-4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Powell]] in his novel ''[[Casanova's Chinese Restaurant]]'' contrasts Don Juan, who "merely liked power" and "obviously did not know what sensuality was", with [[Casanova]], who "undoubtedly had his sensuous moments".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Powell, ''Casanova's Chinese Restaurant'' (1980) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, the first three decades of the twentieth century saw more cultural fervor surrounding the Don Juan figure than perhaps any other period. In one of the most provocative pieces to be published, the endocrinologist [[Gregorio Marañón]] argued that, far from the paragon of masculinity he was often assumed to be, Don Juan actually suffered from an arrested psychosexual development.&lt;ref&gt;Marañón, Gregorio. "Notas sobre la biología de Don Juan" ("Notes about the Biology of Don Juan"), ''Revista de Occidente'' III (1924): 15-53, reprinted in a 1945 book and in his ''Obras completas'', in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1918 flu pandemic|1918 influenza epidemic]] in Spain, the figure of Don Juan served as a metaphor for the flu microbe.&lt;ref name="Davis2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis |first=Ryan A. |year=2013 |title=The Spanish Flu: Narrative and Cultural Identity in Spain, 1918 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=taEhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA105 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-137-33921-8 |pages=105–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Themes===

====Religious implications====
The Don Juan legend discusses the theological question of the [[Act of Contrition]], through which those who regretted their sins before death, would automatically receive salvation. However, others believed that some sins were unforgivable and that a simple Act of Contrition would not save them from damnation for all the harm they had caused. Tirso de Molina's theological perspective is quite apparent through the message he conveys with the dreadful ending of his play.&lt;ref name="Momentos cumbres"/&gt;

====The importance of honor====
Specifically redefined as masculine [[honor]] and feminine integrity. Under the importance of honor, men in this time period found feminine integrity to be a crucial element, to the point where women in the Italian version of Don Juan are devalued. These notions influence Don Juan’s opinions and behavior, leading him to objectify women throughout his life; quantity of women becomes more important to him than social status. He often disguises himself and assumes other identities in order to seduce women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galiş |first=Florin |title=La relación de Don Juan con las mujeres |journal=Journal of Research in Gender Studies |volume=4 |issue=2 |date=2014 |page=731 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a woman was not to remain chaste until marriage, her whole family’s honor would be devalued.&lt;ref name="Momentos cumbres" /&gt;

====Sin and redemption====
Don Juan is first identified as an evil man for his ability to manipulate his language and seduce women, as the devil is known for taking other forms. However, he finally repents of all his wrongdoings.&lt;ref name="Momentos cumbres" /&gt;

==Pronunciation==
In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''Don Juan'' is pronounced {{IPA-es|doɴˈχwan|}}. The usual English pronunciation is {{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|ɒ|n|ˈ|w|ɑː|n}}, with two syllables and a silent "[[J]]". However, in [[Don Juan (Byron)|Byron's epic poem]] it rhymes with ''ruin'' and ''true one'', indicating that it was intended to have the trisyllabic spelling pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|ɒ|n|ˈ|dʒ|uː|ən}}.{{or inline|reason=No, that indicates that the last part of the name is pronounced "uːən", but that could be "huːən" for all the information we provide here, and lacking a source we can't extrapolate "dʒuːən".|date=September 2018}} This would have been characteristic of his English literary predecessors who often imposed English pronunciations on Spanish names, such as [[Don Quixote]] {{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|ɒ|n|ˈ|k|w|ɪ|k|s|ə|t}}.

==In other works==
An English adaptation of Tirso de Molina's play was ''The Libertine'' (1676) by [[Thomas Shadwell]].  A revival of this play in 1692 included songs and dramatic scenes with music by [[Henry Purcell]].  

Among the best-known works about this character are [[Molière]]'s play ''[[Dom Juan|Dom Juan ou le Festin de pierre]]'' (1665), [[Carlo Goldoni|Goldoni]]'s play ''Don Giovanni Tenorio'' (1735), [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron's]] epic poem ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' (1821), [[José de Espronceda]]'s poem ''[[El estudiante de Salamanca]]'' (1840), and [[José Zorrilla]]'s play ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]'' (1844). Along with ''Don Juan Tenorio'' (still performed every November 2 throughout the Spanish-speaking world), ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', an opera composed by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] with libretto by [[Lorenzo da Ponte]], is arguably the best-known version. First performed in Prague in 1787, it inspired works by [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], [[Alexander Pushkin]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Albert Camus]].

''Don Juans Ende'', a play derived from an unfinished 1844 retelling of the tale by poet [[Nikolaus Lenau]], inspired [[Richard Strauss]]' orchestral tone poem ''[[Don Juan (Strauss)|Don Juan]]'', Op. 20,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_um5yLJx-RM Richard Strauss - Don Juan, Op. 20, YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; which premiered on November 11, 1889, in [[Weimar]], where Strauss served as Court [[Kapellmeister]] and conducted the orchestra of the Weimar Opera. In Lenau's rendering, Don Juan's promiscuity springs from his determination to find the ideal woman. Despairing of ever finding her, he ultimately surrenders to melancholy and wills his own death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barbwired.com/barbweb/programs/strauss_donjuan.html Heninger, Barbara. "Program notes for Redwood Symphony." Retrieved March 9, 2014.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019082109/http://www.barbwired.com/barbweb/programs/strauss_donjuan.html |date=October 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Finnish composer [[Jean Sibelius]] wrote the second [[Movement (music)|movement]] of his [[Symphony No. 2 (Sibelius)|second symphony]] based on the climax of Don Juan. The piece begins with a representation of Death walking up the road to Don Juan's house, where Don Juan pleads with Death to let him live.

Swedish film director [[Ingmar Bergman]] wrote and directed a comic [[sequel]] in 1960 titled ''[[The Devil's Eye]]'' in which Don Juan, accompanied by his servant, is sent from [[Hell]] to contemporary [[Sweden]] to seduce a young woman before her marriage.

Don Juan is also mentioned in the musical adaptation of [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Les Miserables]]'', in which the character [[Grantaire]] states that [[Marius Pontmercy]] is acting like Don Juan.

Also in [[Gaston Leroux]]'s ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'', the Phantom writes an opera based on the legend of Don Juan called ''[[Don Juan Triumphant]]''.

Errol Flynn stars as a swashbuckling lover of women who also fights on the side of a good Spanish queen (Viveca Lindfors) against the forces of evil in the film ''The Adventures of Don Juan'' (1948).&lt;ref&gt;HK: I own a copy of the film.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Gunta Virkava and Juhan Ulfsak starred in Estonian film version "Don Juan in Tallinn" based on Samuil Aljošin play. In this version, Don Juan is a woman dressed in men's clothes and is accompanied by her servant Florestino in their adventure in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. 

In 1995, [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Marlon Brando]] starred in the film ''[[Don Juan DeMarco]]'', in which Depp plays the title role, a mental patient convinced he is Don Juan, and who retells his life story to the psychiatrist played by Brando.

The film ''[[Don Jon]]'' (2013) and its womanizing protagonist is a reference to Don Juan.

'''Elfriede Lohse Wächtler''' (born ''Anna Frieda Wächtler''; 4 December 1899 – 31 July 1940) was a German painter of the avant-garde whose works were banned as "[[degenerate art]]", and in some cases destroyed, by the [[Third Reich]]. She was murdered in [[Sonnenstein Nazi Death Institute|a former psychiatric institution at Sonnenstein castle]] in Pirna under [[Action T4]], a forced euthanasia program of Nazi Germany. Since 2000, a memorial center for the T4 program in the house commemorates her life and work in a permanent exhibition.

== Life ==
Elfriede Lohse-Wächtler grew up in a middle-class family, but left at the age of 16 to study at the Royal Arts School Dresden from 1915 to 1918 (fashion, then applied graphics). From 1916 to 1919, she also attended drawing and painting courses at the Dresden Art Academy. She came into contact with the Dresden [[Secession (art)|Secession]] Group 1919 and became part of the circle of friends around [[Otto Dix]], [[Otto Griebel]], and [[Conrad Felixmüller]]. Renting part of the studio of the latter near the Dresden city center she made a living with batiks, postcards and illustrations.

In June 1921, she married the painter and opera singer {{illm|Kurt Lohse|de}}, following him to [[Görlitz]] in 1922 and in 1925 to [[Hamburg]]. The marriage was a difficult one and the couple separated several times in the following years. In 1926, Elfriede Lohse-Wächtler joined the ''Federation of female Hamburgian artists and art lovers''; in 1928. she was able to participate in some exhibitions of the [[New Objectivity]].

In 1929, she suffered a nervous breakdown because of financial and partnership difficulties and was committed to a psychiatric institution in Hamburg-Friedrichsberg. During the two months' stay she painted the ''Friedrichsberg heads'', a piece of work consisting of about 60 drawings and pastels, mainly portraits of fellow patients. After her recovery and a final separation from Kurt Lohse (in 1926), she had a very creative phase. She painted numerous paintings of Hamburg's harbor, scenes from the life of workers and prostitutes, and pitiless self-portraits. But despite some exhibitions, sales, and smaller grants, she lived in grinding poverty.

Due to financial problems and increasing social isolation, she returned to her parents' home in Dresden by midyear 1931. When her mental state worsened her father admitted her to the state mental home at [[Arnsdorf]] in 1932. There she was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]]. From 1932 to 1935 she was still creatively active, drawing portraits and creating arts and crafts. After Kurt Lohse divorced her in May 1935 she was incapacitated due to "incurable insanity".

After refusing to consent to a sterilisation, she was denied the permission to go out of the hospital any more. In December 1935, she underwent a forced surgical sterilisation in the Dresden-Friedrichstadt women's hospital on the grounds of Nazi [[eugenics|eugenicist]] policies. After this traumatic event she never painted again. In 1940 she was deported to the former psychiatric institution at Pirna-Sonnenstein (located in the [[Sonnenstein castle]] in [[Pirna]]), where, on 31 July, she was murdered along with the majority of the other residents as part of the Nazi "euthanasia" program, [[Action T4]]. The official cause of death was "pneumonia with myocardial insufficiency". In the years of 1940 and 1941, a total of 13,720 mainly mentally ill or handicapped people were gassed by Nazis in this institution formerly well known for its humanistic traditions.

[[File:5-eine patientinap.jpg|thumb|''A female patient. Woman with landscape.'', 1929.]]

==Works==
Her most creative period falls within the time of her stay in Hamburg. From 1927 to 1931, she painted some of her major works. The portraits of mentally ill people she drew in Hamburg-Friedrichsberg (1929) and Arnsdorf (1932–1935) have attracted much interest. As part of the "[[degenerate art]]" campaign by the Nazis nine of her works from the art museum [[Hamburger Kunsthalle]] and the [[Altonaer Museum]] were confiscated and presumably destroyed in 1937, as well as a large part of her paintings from Arnsdorf.

==Commemoration and legacy==
Renewed interest in Lohse-Wächtler started with a presentation of some of her paintings in Reinbek near Hamburg. In 1994, an association for the promotion of the works of Elfriede Lohse-Wächtler was founded (''Förderkreis Elfriede Lohse-Wächtler''). 1996 saw the publication of the first [[monograph]] on her works, written by Georg Reinhardt. This and the exhibitions in Dresden, Hamburg-Altona and Aschaffenburg marked the beginning of a broader reception of the artist's work and fate.

In 1999, there was a [[stele]] erected in memory of her at the Saxon Hospital in Arnsdorf and a ward house named after her. In Pirna-Sonnenstein, a street was dedicated to her in 2005, and since 2008, a street in Arnsdorf also carries her name. At the former hospital site in Friedrichsberg (Hamburg-Barmbek-Süd), a rose garden with a commemorative plaque was designed for her in 2004. In the development area close by, another street was also given her name.

'''Ismail Enver Pasha''' ({{lang-ota|اسماعیل انور پاشا}}; {{lang-tr|İsmail Enver Paşa}}; 22 November 1881 – 4 August 1922) was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] military officer and a leader of the 1908 [[Young Turk Revolution]]. He became the main leader of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in both the [[Balkan Wars]] (1912–13) and in [[World War I]] (1914–18). In the course of his career he was known by increasingly elevated titles as he rose through military ranks, including Enver [[Efendi]] ({{rtl-lang |ota|انور افندي}}), Enver [[Bey]] ({{rtl-lang|ota|انور بك}}), and finally Enver [[Pasha]], "pasha" being the honorary title Ottoman military officers gained on promotion to the rank of [[Mirliva]] (major general).

After the [[1913 Ottoman coup d'état|Ottoman coup d’état]] of January 1913, Enver Pasha became (4 January 1914) the Minister of War of the Ottoman Empire, forming one-third of the triumvirate known as the "[[Three Pashas]]" (along with [[Talaat Pasha]] and [[Djemal Pasha]]) who held ''de facto'' rule over the Empire from 1913 until the end of World War I in 1918.  As war minister and ''de facto'' Commander-in-Chief (despite his role as the ''de jure'' Deputy Commander-in-Chief, as the [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]] formally held the title), Enver Pasha was the most powerful figure of the government of the Ottoman Empire. He decided to [[Ottoman entry into World War I|involve the Empire]] in World War I [[Ottoman-German Alliance|on the side of Germany]]. Along with Talaat and Djemal, he was one of the principal perpetrators of the [[Armenian Genocide]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last = Henham| editor1-first= Ralph| editor2-last= Behrens| editor2-first = Paul | title=The Criminal Law of Genocide: International, Comparative and Contextual Aspects|date=2009|publisher= Ashgate | location = Farnham | isbn = 978-1-40949591-8|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tK_pHoNlUYIC&amp;pg=PA5 |quote=The guilty main architects of the genocide Talaat Pasaha [...] and  Enver Pasha...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Freedman|first1=Jeri|title=The Armenian Genocide |date=2009 | publisher =Rosen Pub |location=New York|isbn= 978-1-40421825-3 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cuqxYldvClQC&amp;pg=PA18 |edition=1st | quote =Enver Pasha, Mehmet Talat, and Ahmed Djemal were the three men who headed the CUP.

Prior to World War I, he was hailed at home as "the hero of the [[Young Turk Revolution|revolution]]", and Europeans often spoke of Ottoman Turkey as "Enverland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Asia and the Americas | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0O4-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA923 |volume = 18 |year=1918|page= 923}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a strong proponent of [[Pan-Turkism]].

==Early life and career==

Enver was born in Istanbul on 22 November 1881. Enver's father, Ahmed ({{circa}} 1860–1947), was a [[Gagauz people|Gagauz Turk]] either a bridge-keeper in [[Bitola|Monastir]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Muammer | last = Kaylan | title = The Kemalists: Islamic Revival and the Fate of Secular Turkey | publisher = Prometheus Books | year = 2005 | page = 75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or a small town public prosecutor in the [[Balkans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Handan Nezir | last = Akmese | title = The Birth of Modern Turkey: The Ottoman Military and the March to WWI | publisher = IB Tauris | year = 2005 | page = 44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother Ayşe, an Albanian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Mark | last = Mazower | title = Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews 1430–1950 | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2004 | page = 255 | url = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=c8agAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Salonica%2C+City+of+Ghosts%3A+Christians%2C+Muslims+and+Jews+1430%E2%80%931950&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=enver}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His uncle was [[Halil Kut|Halil Pasha (later Kut)]]. Enver had two younger brothers, [[Nuri Killigil|Nuri]] and Mehmed Kamil, and two younger sisters, Hasene and Mediha.  He studied for different degrees in military schools in the empire and ultimately graduated from the ''Harp Akademisi'' with distinction in 1903. He became a [[major general]] in 1906. He was sent to the [[Third Army (Ottoman Empire)|Third Army]], which was stationed in [[Salonica]]. During his service in the city, he became a member of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP).{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Rise to power==

===Young Turk Revolution===
{{Main|Young Turk Revolution}}
[[File:1908-mesrutiyet.jpg|200px|thumb|Enver Pasha depicted on a [[Young Turks]] flyer with the slogan "Long live the fatherland, long live the nation, long live liberty" written in Ottoman Turkish and French.]]
In 1908, the [[Young Turk Revolution]] broke out in Salonica, and the young Enver quickly became one of its military leaders. The successful revolt brought the CUP to power, ushering in the [[Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|Second Constitutional Era]] of the Ottoman Empire. During the course of the next year, a reactionary conspiracy to organize a [[Ottoman countercoup of 1909|countercoup]] culminated in the "[[31 March Incident]]", which was put down. Enver Bey took an active role in the suppression of the countercoup. Afterwards, he was sent to [[Berlin]] as a military attaché, where he grew to admire the German military culture and strengthened the military ties between Germany and the Ottoman Empire, inviting German officers to reform the [[Ottoman Army]].

===Italo-Turkish War===
{{Main|Italo-Turkish War}}
[[File:Ismail Enver Bey in Cyrenaica.jpg|thumb|left|145px|Enver Bey in Libya during the [[Italo-Turkish War]], 1911–12, wearing the style of hat named "Enveriye" after him.]]
In 1911, [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] launched an invasion of the [[Ottoman Tripolitania|Ottoman vilayet of Tripolitania]] (''Trablus-i Garb'', modern [[Libya]]), starting the [[Italo-Turkish War]]. Enver decided to join the defense of the province and left Berlin for Libya. There, he assumed the overall command after successfully mobilizing 20,000 troops.&lt;ref name=ezber&gt;{{Citation | first = Serdar | last = Hakyemezoğlu | url = http://www.ezberbozanbilgiler.com/bizim-tarih/item/301-buhara-cumhuriyeti-ve-enver-pasa.html |language= tr | title = Buhara Cumhuriyeti ve Enver Paşa | publisher = Ezberbozanbilgiler | accessdate = 24 June 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the outbreak of the [[Balkan Wars]], however, Enver and other Ottoman generals in Libya were called back to Istanbul.  This allowed Italy to take control of Libya. In 1912, thanks to his active role in the war, he was made lieutenant colonel.&lt;ref name=os-ar&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.os-ar.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=240318 | publisher = Osmanlı Araştırmaları Sitesi | title = Enver Paşa Makalesi | language = tr}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the loss of Libya cost the CUP in popularity, and it fell from government after rigging the [[Ottoman general election, 1912|1912 elections]] (known as the ''Sopalı Seçimler'', "Election of Clubs"), to be replaced by the [[Liberal Union (Ottoman Empire)|Liberal Union]] party (which was helped by its military arm, the [[Savior Officers]], that denounced the CUP's actions during the 1912 elections). The defeated CUP assumed an ideology favoring more centralization under Enver.{{Page needed |date=August 2015}}

===Balkan Wars and seizure of political leadership===
{{Main|1913 Ottoman coup d'état}}
[[File:Lieut.-Colonel Tyrrell and Enver Bey after 1913 Ottoman coup d'état.png|thumb|195px|right|Enver Bey (center) talking to the British attaché and press in Constantinople immediately after seizing power in the 1913 [[1913 Ottoman coup d'état|Raid on the Sublime Porte]], also known as the 1913 Ottoman coup d'état.]]
In October 1912, the [[First Balkan War]] broke out, where the Ottoman armies suffered severe defeats at the hands of the [[Balkan League]]. These military reversals weakened the government, and gave Enver his chance to grab for power from the Liberal Union. In a [[1913 Ottoman coup d'état|coup in January 1913]], he returned power to the CUP from the Liberal Union and introduced a triumvirate that came to be called the "[[Three Pashas]]" (Enver Pasha, [[Talaat Pasha]], and [[Djemal Pasha]]). He took the office as [[Minister of War]]. In 1914, he was again Minister of War in the cabinet of [[Said Halim Pasha]], and married HIH Princess Emine Naciye Sultan (1898–1957), the daughter of Prince Süleyman, thus entering the royal family as a [[damat]] ("bridesgroom" to the ruling [[House of Osman]]). His power grew steadily while Europe marched towards total war. He then left the [[London Conference of 1913|peace negotiations]] then under way in London. The renewed hostilities only worsened the Empire's situation, however, as the two major remaining strongholds of [[Battle of Adrianople (1913)|Adrianople]] (Edirne) and [[Battle of Bizani|Yannina]] fell to the Bulgarians and the Greeks, respectively, forcing the Ottomans to concede defeat at the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]].

In June 1913, however, the [[Second Balkan War]] broke out between the Balkan Allies. Enver Bey took advantage of the situation and led an army into [[Eastern Thrace]], recovering Adrianople from the Bulgarians, who had concentrated their forces against the Serbs and Greeks. After this success, Enver Bey became a [[Pasha]], and recognised by some Turks as the "conqueror of Edirne".

==World War I==
{{further|Middle Eastern theatre of World War I}}
Enver Pasha was an architect of the [[Ottoman-German Alliance]], and expected a quick victory in the war that would benefit the Ottoman Empire. Without informing the other members of the Cabinet, he allowed the two German warships [[SMS Goeben]] and [[SMS Breslau]], under the command of German admiral [[Wilhelm Souchon]], to enter the [[Dardanelles]] to escape British [[pursuit of Goeben and Breslau|pursuit]]; the subsequent "donation" of the ships to the neutral Ottomans worked powerfully in Germany's favor, despite French and Russian [[diplomacy]] to keep the Ottoman Empire out of the war. Finally on 29 October, the point of no return was reached when Admiral Souchon, now Commander-in-Chief of the Ottoman navy, took ''Goeben'', ''Breslau'', and a squadron of Ottoman warships into the Black Sea and raided the Russian ports of [[Odessa]], [[Sevastopol]], and [[Feodosiya|Theodosia]]. Russia declared war on Ottoman Empire on 2 November, and Britain followed suit on 5 November. Most of the Turkish cabinet members and CUP leaders were against such a rushed entry to the war, but Enver Pasha held that it was the right course of action.

As soon as the war started, 31 October 1914, Enver ordered that all men of military age report to army recruiting offices. The offices were unable to handle the vast flood of men, and long delays occurred. This had the effect of ruining the crop harvest for that year.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8050-6884-8"/&gt;

===Minister of War===
After taking office in 1913, Enver proved ineffective as War Minister,{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} and frequently over the next four years, the Germans had to support the Ottoman government with generals such as [[Otto Liman von Sanders]], [[Erich von Falkenhayn]], [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz]], and [[Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein]]. The Germans also gave the Ottoman government military supplies and fuel.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Enver Pasha's message to the army and the people was "war until final victory". During the war, living conditions deteriorated rapidly, and discontent grew. Enver would remain War Minister until he fled the country in 1918.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Battle of Sarikamish, 1914===
{{Main|Battle of Sarikamish}}
[[File:Enver wwI.jpg|thumb|upright|Enver Pasha in 1914]]

Enver Pasha assumed command of the Ottoman forces arrayed against the Russians in the [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasus theatre]]. He wanted to encircle the Russians, force them out of Ottoman territory, and take back [[Kars]] and [[Batumi]], which had been ceded after the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78]]. Enver thought of himself as a great military leader, while the German military adviser, [[Otto Liman von Sanders|Liman von Sanders]], thought of him as incompetent.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8050-6884-8"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fromkin, David|title=A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Vh8r6M8QQMC|publisher=H. Holt|location=New York|year=2001|pages=119|isbn=0-8050-6884-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enver ordered a complex attack on the Russians, placed himself in personal control of the [[Third Army (Ottoman Empire)|Third Army]], and was utterly defeated at the [[Battle of Sarikamish]] in December 1914 – January 1915. His strategy seemed feasible on paper, but he had ignored external conditions, such as the terrain and the weather. Enver's army (90,000 men) was defeated by the Russian force (100,000 men), and in the subsequent retreat, tens of thousands of Turkish soldiers died. This was the single worst Ottoman defeat of [[World War I]]. On his return to Constantinople, Enver Pasha blamed his failure on his Armenian soldiers, although in January 1915, an Armenian named Hovannes had saved his life during a battle by carrying Enver through battle lines on his back.&lt;ref&gt;Derogy, Jacques.

===Commanding the forces of the capital, 1915–1918===
{{Main |Battle of Gallipoli}}
[[File:Kaiser W in Gallipoli.jpg|thumb|[[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] and Enver Pasha in Gallipoli]]

After his defeat at Sarıkamısh, Enver returned to Istanbul (Constantinople) and took command of the Turkish forces around the capital. He was confident that the capital was safe from any Allied attacks.{{Sfn | Moorehead | 1997 | p = 79}}  The British and French were planning on forcing the approaches to Constantinople in the hope of knocking the Ottomans out of the war. A large Allied fleet assembled and staged an attack on the [[Dardanelles]] on 18 March 1915. The attack (the forerunner to the failed [[Gallipoli campaign]]) was a disaster, resulting in the loss of several ships. As a result, Enver turned over command to [[Liman von Sanders]], who led the successful defence of Gallipoli, along with [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]]. Enver then left to attend to pressing concerns on the Caucasus Front. Later, after many towns on the peninsula had been destroyed and women and children killed by the Allied bombardment, Enver proposed setting up a concentration camp for the remaining French and British citizens in the empire. [[Henry Morgenthau, Sr.|Henry Morgenthau]], the American ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, convinced Enver not to go through with this plan.{{Sfn | Moorehead | 1997 | p = 166–68}}

===Yildirim===
Enver’s plan for [[Erich von Falkenhayn|Falkenhayn]]’s [[Yildirim Army Group]] was to retake Baghdad, recently [[Fall of Baghdad (1917)|taken]] by [[Frederick Stanley Maude|Maude]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} This was nearly impossible for logistical reasons. Turkish troops were deserting freely, and when Enver visited [[Beirut]] in June 1917, soldiers were forbidden to be stationed along his route for fear that he would be assassinated. Lack of rolling stock meant that troops were often detrained at [[Damascus]] and marched south.{{Sfn | Woodward |  1998 | pp = 160–1}}

===Army of Islam===

[[File:Wilhelm enver.jpg|thumb|Wilhelm II and Enver Pasha in 1917]]

During 1917, due to the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and subsequent [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]], the Russian army in the [[Caucasus]] had ceased to exist. At the same time, the Committee of Union and Progress managed to win the friendship of the Bolsheviks with the signing of the Ottoman-Russian friendship treaty (1 January 1918). Enver looked for victory when Russia withdrew from the Caucasus region. When Enver discussed his plans for taking over southern Russia, he ordered the creation of a new military force called the [[Ottoman Army of Islam|Army of Islam]] which would have no German officers. Enver's Army of Islam avoided Georgia and marched through [[Azerbaijan]]. The [[Third Army (Ottoman Empire)|Third Army]] under [[Vehib Pasha]] was also moving forward to pre-war borders and towards the [[First Republic of Armenia]], which formed the frontline in the Caucasus. General [[Tovmas Nazarbekian]] was the commander on the [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasus front]], and [[Andranik Ozanian]] took the command of Armenia within the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman advance was halted at the [[Battle of Sardarabad]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The Army of Islam, under the control of [[Nuri Pasha]], moved forward and attacked Australian, New Zealand, British, and Canadian troops led by [[General Lionel Charles Dunsterville]] at [[Baku]]. General Dunsterville ordered the evacuation of the city on 14 September, after six weeks of occupation, and withdrew to Iran;&lt;ref&gt;[[Homa Katouzian]], ''State and Society in Iran: The Eclipse of the Qajars and the Emergence of the Pahlavis'', (I.B. Tauris, 2006), 141.&lt;/ref&gt; most of the Armenian population escaped with British forces. The Ottomans and their Azerbaijani allies, after the [[Battle of Baku]], entered the city on 15 September.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

However, after the [[Armistice of Mudros]] between [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] on 30 October, Ottoman troops were obliged to withdraw and replaced by the [[Triple Entente]]. These conquests in the [[Caucasus]] counted for very little in the war as a whole but they did however ensure that Baku remained within the boundaries of [[Azerbaijan]] while a part of [[Soviets]] and later as an independent nation.

==Armistice and exile==
[[File:Enver Paşa in Batumi in 1918.jpg|thumb|left|Enver Pasha in [[Batumi]] in 1918.]]
Faced with defeat, the Sultan dismissed Enver from his post as War Minister on 4 October 1918, while the rest of [[Talaat Pasha]]'s government resigned on 14 October 1918. On 30 October 1918, the Ottoman Empire capitulated by signing the [[Armistice of Mudros]]. Two days later, the "[[Three Pashas]]" all fled into exile. On 1 January 1919, the new government expelled Enver Pasha from the army.  He was tried ''in absentia'' in the [[Turkish Courts-Martial of 1919–20]] for crimes of "plunging the country into war without a legitimate reason, forced deportation of Armenians and leaving the country without permission" and condemned to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = U Mich | url = http://www.umd.umich.edu/dept/armenian/papazian/misplace.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20020404005331/http://www.umd.umich.edu/dept/armenian/papazian/misplace.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2002-04-04 | title = Refuting Genocide }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enver first went to [[German Empire|Germany]], where he communicated and worked with German [[Communist]] figures like [[Karl Radek]]. In April 1919, Enver left for Moscow in order to serve as a secret envoy for his friend General [[Hans von Seeckt]] who wished for a German-Soviet alliance.&lt;ref name = "Wheeler-Bennett, John page 126"&gt;{{Citation | last = Wheeler-Bennett | first = John | title = The Nemesis of Power | place = London | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1967 | page = 126}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1920, Enver sent Seeckt a letter in which he offered on behalf of the Soviet Union the partition of Poland in return for German arms deliveries to Soviet Russia.&lt;ref name="Wheeler-Bennett, John page 126" /&gt; Besides working for General von Seeckt, Enver envisioned cooperation between the new [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russian]] government against the British, and went to [[Moscow]].  There he was well-received, and established contacts with representatives from [[Central Asia]] and other exiled CUP members as the director of the Soviet Government’s Asiatic Department.{{Sfn | Moorehead | 1997 | p = 300}}  He also met with [[Bolshevik]] leaders, including [[Lenin]]. He tried to support the [[Turkish national movement]] and corresponded with [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]], giving him the guarantee that he did not intend to intervene in the movement in [[Anatolia]].  Between 1 and 8 September 1920, he was in Baku for the "Congress of Eastern Peoples", representing Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco. His appearance was a personal triumph, but the congress failed in its aim to create a mass pro-Bolshevik movement among Moslems. Victor Serge, a witness, recorded that:

{{quote|At Baku, Enver Pasha put in a sensational appearance. A whole hall full of Orientals broke into shouts, with scimitars and yataghans brandished aloft: '''Death to imperialism''" All the same, genuine understanding with the Islamic world...was still difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Serge |first1=Victor |title=emoirs of a Revolutionary |date=1984 |publisher=Writer and Readers Publishing Inc |location=New York |isbn=0 86316 070 0 |page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

==Relations with Mustafa Kemal==
[[File:Picardie manoeuvres 1910.jpg|thumb|Enver and Mustafa Kemal at European manoeuvres, 1910.]]
Much has been written about the poor relations between Enver and [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]], two men who played pivotal roles in the Turkish history of the 20th century. Both hailed from the Balkans, and the two served together in North Africa during the wars preceding World War I, Enver being Mustafa Kemal's senior. Enver disliked Mustafa Kemal for his circumspect attitude toward the political agenda pursued by his Committee of Union and Progress, and regarded him as a serious rival.&lt;ref name="Kaylan"&gt;{{cite book| first =Muammer | last = Kaylan |title=The Kemalists: Islamic Revival and the Fate of Secular Turkey |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aEh_IofABkYC&amp;pg=PA77 | publisher =Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-61592-897-2|page= 77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mustafa Kemal (later known as Atatürk) considered Enver to be a dangerous figure who might lead the country to ruin;&lt;ref name = "Zürcher1984"&gt;{{cite book| first =Erik Jan | last = Zürcher |author-link=Erik-Jan Zürcher |title= The Unionist Factor: The Rôle &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; of the Committee of Union and Progress in the Turkish National Movement, 1905–1926|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BUGIBa78aWwC&amp;pg=PA59 |date=1 January 1984 | publisher =Brill |isbn=90-04-07262-4|page= 59}}&lt;/ref&gt; he criticized Enver and his colleagues for their policies and their involvement of the Ottoman Empire in World War I.&lt;ref name = "HarrisCriss2009"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = George Sellers | last1 = Harris| first2= Bilge | last2 = Criss | title = Studies in Atatürk’s Turkey: The American Dimension | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KsNvyTwz9y0C&amp;pg=PA85 | year = 2009 |publisher=Brill |isbn=90-04-17434-6|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "RubinKirişci2001"&gt;{{cite book| first1=Barry M | last1 = Rubin | authorlink1 =Barry M.

On 30 July 1921, with the [[Turkish War of Independence]] in full swing, Enver decided to return to Anatolia.  He went to [[Batum]] to be close to the new border. However, Mustafa Kemal did not want him among the [[Turkish revolutionaries]].  Mustafa Kemal had stopped all friendly ties with Enver Pasha and the CUP as early as 1912,&lt;ref name = "Zürcher1984" /&gt; and he explicitly rejected the [[pan-Turkic]] ideas and what Mustafa Kemal perceived as Enver Pasha’s utopian goals.&lt;ref name = "Kaylan" /&gt; Enver Pasha changed his plans and traveled to Moscow where he managed to win the trust of the Soviet authorities. In November 1921 he was sent by Lenin to Bukhara in the [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] to help suppress the [[Basmachi Revolt]] against the local pro-Moscow [[Bolshevism|Bolshevik]] regime. Instead, however, he made secret contacts with some of the rebellion’s leaders and, along with a small number of followers, defected to the ''basmachi'' side.  His aim was to unite the numerous basmachi groups under his own command and mount a co-ordinated offensive against the Bolsheviks in order to realize his pan-Turkic dreams. After a number of successful military operations he managed to establish himself as the rebels’ supreme commander, and turned their disorganized forces into a small but well-drilled army.  His command structure was built along German lines and his staff included a number of experienced Turkish officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Peter | last = Hopkirk | authorlink = Peter Hopkirk|title = Setting the East Ablaze | place = London | year = 1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=August 2015}}

From {{Harvnb | Fromkin  | 1989 | p = 487}}:
{{Quote | However Enver’s personal weaknesses reasserted themselves. He was a vain, strutting man who loved uniforms, medals and titles.  For use in stamping official documents, he ordered a golden seal that described him as ‘Commander-in-Chief of all the Armies of Islam, Son-in-Law of the Caliph and Representative of the Prophet.’  Soon he was calling himself Emir of Turkestan, a practice not conducive to good relations with the Emir whose cause he served. At some point in the first half of 1922, the Emir of Bukhara broke off relations with him, depriving him of troops and much-needed financial support. The Emir of Afghanistan also failed to march to his aid.}}

On 4 August 1922, as he allowed his troops to celebrate the [[Kurban Bayramı]] (Eid al-Adha) holiday while retaining a guard of 30 men at his headquarters near the village of Ab-i-Derya near [[Dushanbe]], the Red Army [[Bashkir people|Bashkir]] cavalry brigade under the command of Yakov Melkumov (Hakob Melkumian) launched a surprise attack. According to some sources, Enver and some 25 of his men mounted their horses and charged the approaching troops, when Enver was killed by machine-gun fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Feridun | last = Kandemir | title = Enver Paşa'nın Son Gũnleri | language = tr | pp = 65–69 | publisher = Gũven Yayınevi | year = 1955}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his memoirs, Enver Pasha’s aide Yaver Suphi Bey stated that Enver Pasha died of a bullet wound right above his heart during a cavalry charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Yaver | last = Suphi Bey | title = Enver Paşa'nın Son Günleri | language = tr | page = 239 | publisher = Çatı Kitapları | year = 2007 | ISBN = 978-975-8845-28-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, according to Melkumov’s memoirs, Enver managed to escape on horseback and hid for four days in the village of Chaghan.  His hideout was located after a Red Army officer infiltrated the village in disguise. Melkumov’s troops then stormed Chaghan, and in the ensuing combat Enver was killed by Melkumov himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Interview | first = Y | last = Melkumov | language = ru | place = [[Armenia|AM]] | newspaper = Novoe Vremya | url = http://nv.am/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Melkumov | first =Ya.

[[File:EnverpashaGrave.JPG|thumb|right|Enver Pasha’s grave at the [[Monument of Liberty, Istanbul|Abide-i Hürriyet]] (Monument of Liberty) cemetery in Istanbul, where his remains were interred in 1996.]]
From {{Harvnb | Fromkin | 1989 | p = 488}}:
{{Quote | There are several accounts of how Enver died.  According to the most persuasive of them, when the Russians attacked he gripped his pocket Koran and, as always, charged straight ahead. Later his decapitated body was found on the field of battle. His Koran was taken from his lifeless fingers and was filed in the archives of the Soviet secret police.}}

Enver’s body was buried near Ab-i-Derya. In 1996, his remains were brought to [[Turkey]] and reburied at [[Monument of Liberty, Istanbul|Abide-i Hürriyet]] (Monument of Liberty) cemetery in [[Şişli]], [[Istanbul]].  Enver’s image remains controversial in Turkey, since there are those who blame him for the Ottoman entrance into World War I and the subsequent collapse of the Empire.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

==Family legacy==

===Family===
After Enver’s death, three of his four siblings, [[Nuri Killigil|Nuri]] (1889–1949), Mehmed Kamil (1900–62), and Hasene Hanım, adopted the surname "Killigil" after the 1934 [[Surname Law]] required all Turkish citizens to adopt a surname.

Enver’s sister Hasene Hanım married Nazım Bey.  Nazım Bey, an aid-de-camp of [[Abdul Hamid II]], survived an assassination attempt during the 1908 [[Young Turk Revolution]] of which his brother-in-law Enver was a leader.&lt;ref name="Kedourie2013"&gt;{{cite book| first =Sylvia | last = Kedourie |title= Seventy-five Years of the Turkish Republic| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YQHaAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65 |date= 13 September 2013|publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn= 978-1-135-26705-6 | page =65}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Nazım, Hasene gave birth to [[:tr:Faruk Kenç|Faruk Kenç]] (1910–2000), who would become a famous Turkish film director and producer.

Enver’s other sister, Mediha Hanım (later Mediha Orbay; 1895–1983), married [[Kâzım Orbay]], a prominent Turkish general and politician. On 16 October 1945, their son Haşmet Orbay, Enver's nephew, shot and killed a physician named Neşet Naci Arzan, an event known as the "[[:tr:Ankara cinayeti|Ankara murder]]". At the urging of the Governor of Ankara, [[Nevzat Tandoğan]], Haşmet Orbay's friend Reşit Mercan initially took the blame. After a second trial revealed Haşmet Orbay as the perpetrator, however, he was convicted.  The murder became a [[political scandal]] in Turkey after the suicide of Tandoğan, the suspicious death of the case’s public prosecutor [[:tr:Fahrettin Karaoğlan|Fahrettin Karaoğlan]], and the resignation of Kâzım Orbay from his position as [[General Staff of the Republic of Turkey|Chief of the General Staff of Turkey]] after his son’s conviction.

===Marriage and issue===
By his marriage to Emine Naciye Sultan, a granddaughter of sultan [[Abdülmecid I]], Enver had:
* HH Princess [[Dr.]] Mahpeyker Enver Hanımsultan (1917–2000), married and divorced, [[Dr.]] Fikret Ürgüp (1918–?), and had issue, one son:
** Hasan Ürgüp (1948–89) ''unmarried and without issue''
* HH Princess Turkan Enver Hanımsultan (1919–89), married HE Huvayda Mayatepek, [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[Ambassador]] to [[Denmark]], and had issue, one son:

*** Mihrishah Türkan Mayatepek (b.1992)
* HH Prince Sultanzade Captain Ali Enver Beyefendi (1921 – [[Australia]], December 1971), married and had issue, one daughter:
** Arzu Enver (b. 1955), ''married Aslan Sadıkoğlu'' and had Issue{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} 
*** Burak Sadıkoğlu

His widow remarried his brother Mehmed Kamil Killigil (1900–1962) in 1923, and had one daughter: 
* HH Princess Rana Killigil Hanımsultan (1926; Paris – 14 April 2008; Istanbul), married Osman Sadi Eldem and had three children:

After postdoctoral studies at [[Cornell University]] and [[Harvard University]], he held faculty positions at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] and the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]] before joining Texas A&amp;M in 1970. At Texas A&amp;M, he was chairman of the mathematics department from 1970 to 1978.&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;[http://www.math.tamu.edu/department_review/deptselfstudy/blakley.html Curriculum vitae], Texas A&amp;M University, retrieved 2010-07-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blakley served on the board of directors of the [[International Association for Cryptologic Research]] from 1993 to 1995.&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt; He co-founded the ''[[International Journal of Information Security]]'', published by [[Springer-Verlag]], in 2000,&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journalseek.net/cgi-bin/journalseek/journalsearch.cgi?field=issn&amp;query=1615-5262 JournalSeek: International Journal of Information Security], retrieved 2010-07-14.&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to serve on its advisory board.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/computer/security+and+cryptology/journal/10207?detailsPage=editorialBoard International Journal of Information Security editorial board], retrieved 2010-07-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

His son, George Robert (Bob) Blakley III, is also a computer security researcher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://notabob.blogspot.com/2005_09_01_archive.html Blog post by Bob Blakley III], September 2005, describing their relationship. Retrieved 2010-07-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secret-sharing scheme==
In order to split a secret into several shares, Blakley's scheme specifies the secret as a point in ''n''-dimensional space, and gives out shares that correspond to [[hyperplane]]s that intersect the secret point.  Any ''n'' such hyperplanes will specify the point, while fewer than ''n'' hyperplanes will leave at least one degree of freedom, and thus leave the point unspecified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | title = Safeguarding cryptographic keys | journal = Proceedings of the National Computer Conference
 | volume = 48 | pages = 313–317 | year = 1979
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, [[Adi Shamir|Shamir]]'s [[Shamir's Secret Sharing|secret sharing scheme]] represents the secret as the ''y''-intercept of an ''n''-[[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] polynomial, and shares correspond to points on the polynomial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
In 2001 Blakley received an honorary doctorate from [[Queensland University of Technology]].&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107102729/http://www.math.tamu.edu/news/2001pere.html |archivedate=January 7, 2013 |url=http://www.math.tamu.edu/news/2001pere.html |title=2001 Travel and Talks |publisher=Mathematics Department, Texas A&amp;M University |accessdate=2010-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hervé Daniel Marcel Falciani''' ({{IPA-it|falˈtʃaːni|lang}}; born 9 January 1972) is a French-Italian [[systems engineer]] and [[whistleblower]] who is credited with "the biggest banking leak in history."&lt;ref name="guardian_2015_feb_8"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/08/hsbc-files-expose-swiss-bank-clients-dodge-taxes-hide-millions | title=HSBC files show how Swiss bank helped clients dodge taxes and hide millions: Data in massive cache of leaked secret bank account files lifts lid on questionable practices at subsidiary of one of world’s biggest financial institutions | publisher=The Guardian | date=8 February 2015 | accessdate=27 November 2015 | author1=Leigh, David | author2=Ball, James | author3=Garside, Juliette | author4=Pegg, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Falciani began collaborating with numerous European nations by providing allegedly illegal [[data theft|stolen information]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8562381.stm|title=BBC News - HSBC admits huge Swiss bank data theft|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icij.org/project/swiss-leaks/whistleblower-thief-hero-introducing-source-data-shook-hsbc|title=Whistleblower?

In the HSBC-2010 affair, Hervé Falciani, a former bank executive with HSBC in [[Geneva]], was arrested by the Swiss police on suspicion of data smuggling. He took refuge in France ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Falciani is the person behind the "[[Lagarde list]]", so called as it is a list of HSBC clients who allegedly used the bank to evade taxes and launder money that Falciani leaked to ex-French Minister of Finance [[Christine Lagarde]], currently the managing director of the  [[International Monetary Fund]]. Lagarde, in turn, sent the list to governments whose citizens were on the list.&lt;ref name="HSBC man"&gt;{{cite web|title=HSBC man who passed clients' details to tax investigators escapes extradition|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/08/hsbc-tax-extradition-herve-falciani|website=The Guardian|publisher=Associated Press|date= 8 May 2013 |accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 December 2014, Falciani was indicted in absentia by the Swiss federal government for violating the country's [[Banking in Switzerland#Banking privacy|bank secrecy laws]] and for [[industrial espionage]]. The indictment accused Falciani of stealing information from HSBC's Geneva offices and passing it on to tax authorities in France. HSBC had been indicted in France for [[money laundering]] in November 2014.&lt;ref name="Employee Falciani"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Hugo|title=Ex-HSBC Employee Falciani Said Indicted on Data Theft|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-11/ex-hsbc-employee-falciani-said-indicted-on-data-theft.html|publisher=Bloomberg|date= 11 December 2014 |accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, Switzerland’s federal court sentenced Falciani to five years in prison{{snd}}the "longest sentence ever demanded by the confederation’s public ministry in a case of banking data theft". Falciani was accused of "aggravated financial espionage, data theft and violation of commercial and banking secrecy".&lt;ref name="theguardian_2015_nov_27"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/nov/27/hsbc-whistleblower-jailed-five-years-herve-falciani?CMP=twt_gu | title=HSBC whistleblower jailed for five years over biggest leak in banking history | publisher=The Guardian | date=27 November 2015 | accessdate=27 November 2015 | author=Garside, Juliette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
After studying at the [[Sophia Antipolis]] technology park, Falciani became a computer engineer at the Swiss branch of [[HSBC]] between 2001 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/03/24/actualidad/1364150299_615917.html#sumario_2|title=La ‘lista Falciani’ conduce hasta Gürtel|publisher=Ediciones El País|work= [[El País|EL PAÍS]] |first= José Manuel |last= Romero |date= 25 March 2013 |accessdate= 15 February 2015 |trans-title=The Falciani list leads to Gürtel |language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he reorganized the database of the organization to improve its security.&lt;ref name="faldiario"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eldiario.es/economia/falciani-HSBC-quien_0_80842176.html|title=¿Quién es Falciani? ¿Qué sabe Falciani?|work=eldiario.es |first= Juan Luis |last= Sánchez |date= 18 December 2012 |accessdate= 15 February 2015 |trans-title=Who is Falciani? What does Falciani know? |language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falciani has declared that he realized that the way data was managed at HSBC fostered [[tax evasion]], and proposed a new system, which was rejected by his superiors.&lt;ref name="pais"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/04/15/actualidad/1366013998_617805.html|title=Falciani robó los datos de la banca suiza tras ver sus actuaciones "escandalosas"|publisher=Ediciones El País|work=EL PAÍS |first= Fernando J. |last= Pérez |date= 15 April 2013 |accessdate= 15 February 2015 |trans-title=Falciani stole the data from the Swiss bank after seeing their "scandalous" actions |language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the HSBC reaction, and because he believed that "it is a systematic violation of fundamental rights of citizens by subtracting funds that should be allocated to the general interest", for two years Falciani collected evidence of potential tax fraud involving 130,000 individuals. Falciani tried to make the information available to the Swiss judicial authorities, but was unsuccessful. This claim was corroborated by French prosecutors.&lt;ref name="20m"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1786470/0/extradicion-suiza/evasores-fiscales/lista-falciani/#|title=Falciani colaboró con varias Justicias europeas con datos que llenarían "un tren de mercancías"|author=20Minutos|work=20minutos.es - Últimas Noticias}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Falciani made a trip to [[Beirut]] and, using a false identity, attempted to sell what he claimed was private client information from a Swiss bank to [[Bank Audi]]. Falciani claims that he did this in order to intentionally activate an internal alarm system available to Swiss banking employers, the Swiss Bankers Association ([[Swissbanking]]), and which is monitored by the police. He hoped this would allow Swiss prosecutors to become aware of HSBC's criminal activities. In their prosecution against him, however, Swiss authorities claimed that he went to Beirut with the intention of selling the data for profit. In either case, an alarm was indeed set off after a woman reported that a man calling himself Ruben al-Chidiak had attempted to sell her the private data.&lt;ref name="bankrobber"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Keefe|first1=Patrick Radden|title=The Bank Robber|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/30/herve-falcianis-great-swiss-bank-heist|accessdate=27 May 2016|publisher=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falciani says he paid for the airline tickets from his own HSBC account so that authorities could track him.&lt;ref name="pais" /&gt;

On 22 December 2008, Falciani was arrested, questioned and released.&lt;ref name="pais" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://partidox.org/todo-sobre-herve-falciani/|title=Todo lo que siempre quiso saber sobre Hervé Falciani|work=partidox.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expansion.com/2013/04/15/economia/1366017305.html|title=Falciani: "En HSBC Suiza vi actuaciones escandalosas"|work=Expansion}}&lt;/ref&gt; On release, Falciani travelled to France where he was arrested in January 2009, forcing the Swiss judiciary to issue an international [[arrest warrant]] for him. Switzerland called on France to search his home and to seize the laptop used to send the files. After searching the address, the prosecutor of Nice, [[Eric de Montgolfier]],&lt;ref name="cronica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/04/19/actualidad/1366401771_131857.html|title=Hervé Falciani: "Estados Unidos me avisó: Ve a España, tu vida corre peligro"|publisher=Ediciones El País|work=EL PAÍS |first= Manuel |last= Altozano |date= 21 April 2013 |accessdate= 15 February 2015 |trans-title=Hervé Falciani: "The United States advised me: Go to Spain, your life is in danger" |language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; opened his own investigation, not against Falciani, but against alleged tax fraudsters appearing in the list. The so-called Falciani list remains in France. An international collaboration began with various judicial authorities and remains ongoing. The Falciani list created a diplomatic incident between Switzerland and France. The latter finally agreed to return the data, but only after the contents had been examined. Afterwards Falciani fled to Spain on the advice of the U.S. government because "it would be easy for someone to pay" to try to kill him. Upon arrival, he was arrested in Barcelona in July 2012, due to the Swiss international warrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2012/07/24/actualidad/1343140635_947863.html|title=Arrestado el exempleado de HSBC acusado de robar datos secretos|publisher=Ediciones El País|work=EL PAÍS|date= 24 July 2012 |accessdate= 15 February 2015 |trans-title=Arrested ex-employee of HSBC accused of stealing secret data |language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was jailed at Valdemoro prison (Madrid), waiting for the [[Audiencia Nacional (Spain)|Audiencia Nacional]] to decide on his extradition to Switzerland. On 18 December 2012, the Audiencia Nacional released him provisionally.&lt;ref name="faldiario" /&gt; It was in maximum security conditions: eight bodyguards and bulletproof vest. After that Falciani hid in Spain under a system of maximum security protection sponsored by the [[UN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eldiario.es/zonacritica/Falciani-espanol-paradigma-corrupcion-estructural_6_142845737.html|title=Falciani y el Estado español: paradigma de la corrupción estructural|work=eldiario.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, on 8 May 2013, Falciani was released.&lt;ref name="oculto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eldiario.es/economia/Falciani-millones-espanol-oculto-HSBC_0_200529991.html|title=Falciani cifra en 200.000 millones el dinero que se evade en impuestos|work=eldiario.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Audiencia Nacional (Spain)|Audiencia Nacional]], given the ongoing collaboration between Spanish and French courts, decided not to extradite Falciani, the reason being that he had provided information indicative of "severely irregular" suspicious activity, and of illegal and criminal offenses. He was released because in Spain there is no legal concept of [[bank secrecy]], and information technology trade secrets can not be used to hide unlawful activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/05/08/actualidad/1368011173_885224.html|title=La Audiencia Nacional rechaza la extradición de Falciani a Suiza|publisher=Ediciones El País|work=EL PAÍS |first= Fernando J. |last= Pérez |date= 8 May 2013 |accessdate= 15 February 2015 |trans-title=The National Court rejects the extradition of Falciani to Switzerland |language= Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, Falciani was called to assist the Argentine federal taxation agency (AFIP) in the fight against money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ambito.com/noticia.asp?id=737795 |title= Se puede frenar la salida de dinero negro de Argentina |date= 22 April 2014 |accessdate= 15 February 2015|work= ambito.com |trans-title=It can slow down the exit of black money from Argentina |language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falciani published a book about his experience in the HSBC scandal called ''Séisme sur la planète finance'' (''Earthquake on Planet Finance'' in English) that was published in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Delahousse|first1=Mathieu|title="SwissLeaks" : un polar signé Hervé Falciani|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/justice/20150410.OBS6911/swissleaks-un-polar-signe-herve-falciani.html|accessdate=27 May 2016|publisher=L'Observateur}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in [[Paris]]&lt;ref name="bankrobber" /&gt; for a time, but continued working with Spanish authorities, and stood as a candidate in Spanish elections for the anti-corruption X Party. In April 2018 he was again arrested in Madrid &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-44029158&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently facing possible extradition to Switzerland, with a decision expected on September 11th.

Spanish high court has rejected the extradition request on the grounds that the Spanish legal code does not recognize ‘aggravated financial espionage’.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/18/spain-hsbc-whistleblower-switzerland-herve-falciani Spain rejects extraditing HSBC whistleblower to Switzerland] The Guardian, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activity==

Hervé Falciani was first in the electoral list of the new Spanish political party [[X Party|Citizen Network X Party]] for the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Spain)|European elections of 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/is-spains-newest-political-party-party-x-too-idealistic/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0|title= Democracy.

In February 2015, it was announced that Falciani will collaborate with the Spanish party [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] to draft measures against tax evasion for the party's political program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2015-02-09/herve-falciani-colaborara-con-podemos-para-luchar-contra-la-evasion-fiscal_706272/|title = Hervé Falciani colaborará con Podemos para luchar contra la evasión fiscal|website = El Confidencial|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.eldiario.es/economia/Falciani-comienza-trabajar-Podemos-proponer_0_354864739.html|title = Falciani ficha por Podemos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Falciani claims he was kidnapped by [[Israel]]i [[Mossad]] agents in Geneva, who were seeking information on bank clients with [[Hezbollah]] ties.&lt;ref name=nyt13&gt;{{cite news |last1=Carvajal |first1=Doreen |last2=Minder |first2=Raphael |title=A Fugitive with a Cause |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=8 August 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/business/global/a-whistle-blower-who-can-name-names-of-swiss-bank-account-holders.html |accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falciani claims that his motives are to repel Switzerland’s "attack" on other countries' tax laws and exchequers.&lt;ref name="Schumper"&gt;M.V., ''[https://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2013/10/banks-and-tax-evasion The fall-out from Falciani]'', Schumpeter Business and management blog, The Economist, 16 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; HSBC's position is that Falciani is not a whistleblower, that he has instead tried to sell, not release, the stolen data, and only started to cooperate with authorities after being imprisoned in Spain.&lt;ref name="Schumper"/&gt; Regarding this allegation the [[Audiencia Nacional]], a high court in Spain, stated that "this fact" (the court's quotation marks in reference to the allegation):

&lt;blockquote&gt;appears somewhat confused and inconsistent with the factual story that we present, which do seem objectively specific episodes of provision of information and effective collaboration with authorities of other states, which indicates a determined attitude of Falciani and not an economic motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Belén |last=Carreño|url=http://www.eldiario.es/economia/Falciani-libre_0_130187276.html|title=Falciani, libre|website=eldiario.es |date=8 May 2013 |accessdate= 15 February 2015 |trans-title=Falciani, free |language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Indictment==
Falciani was indicted by Switzerland on 11 December 2014, for violating the country's [[Banking in Switzerland#Banking privacy|bank secrecy laws]] and for [[industrial espionage]]. Falciani (who was not named in the indictment, as is customary for Switzerland) was charged with stealing information from HSBC's Geneva offices and passing it on to French tax authorities. The Swiss prosecutors said they were willing to try Falciani in absentia for his alleged crimes.&lt;ref name="Employee Falciani" /&gt;

In the month prior to his indictment, France had indicted HSBC for [[money laundering]]. Falciani had also offered his services to the government of India, which had been investigating money laundering abetted by HSBC. The Swiss government had refused to help the Indian government in its investigation of Indian citizens who were abetted in tax evasion by HSBC on the basis that the information detailing HSBC's alleged transgression was stolen.&lt;ref name="Black Money Whistleblower"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tiwari|first1=Noopur|title=Black Money Whistleblower Herve Falciani Alleges 'Agenda' in Indictment by Switzerland|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/black-money-whistleblower-herve-falciani-alleges-agenda-in-indictment-by-switzerland-633558|publisher=NDTV|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the [[NDTV|Indian television network NDTV]], Falciani said that Switzerland indicted him as part of an "agenda" to stifle whistleblowers like himself who have exposed corruption in the Swiss banking industry.&lt;ref name="Black Money Whistleblower" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4081">'''Ioannis Orlandos''' ({{lang-el|Ιωάννης Ορλάνδος}}) was a Greek politician and revolutionary. Orlandos was born in c. 1770 in [[Spetses]] and died in 1852 in [[Hydra (island)|Hydra]].

== Early life and Greek Revolution ==
[[File:Orlandos.jpg|thumb|180px|Ioannis Orlandos]]

In Hydra, where he had been living since 1811, he married the sister of [[Georgios Kountouriotis|Georgios]] and [[Lazaros Kountouriotis]], Hydriote landlords and shipowners. He was also a significant shipowner before the [[Greek War of Independence|revolution]]. At the start of it, he gave all his ships to the revolutionary government. He became a delegate from Hydra at the [[First National Assembly at Epidaurus]] and a member of the twelve-member committee that modified the text of the first constitution. He had the position of the vice-president of the legislative corps from 13 January until April 1823. On 26 April and after Lazaros Kountouriotis denied the position, he was elected president of the legislative corps. A month later, on 22 May 1823, disappointed from the way politics had taken and anticipating the [[Greek civil wars of 1824–1825|upcoming civil war]], he resigned from his post. His political opponents had already accused him of factionalism due to the assistance he provided to Kountouriotis. In June 1823 he became a member of a committee jointly with [[Andreas Louriotis]] and [[Andreas Zaimis]] to negotiate about a loan in [[London]]. Before departing for the British capital, he wrote a letter about the need of unity and avoidance of civil wars. Also, on November 1823 he visited [[Lord Byron]] in [[Cephalonia]]. In January 1824, he and Louriotis, a man of [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos|Mavrokordatos]], were the Greek ambassadors who made the negotiations and finally borrowed the first British loan during the revolution, £800,000. In London they were formally welcomed and they even met the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]], [[George Canning]]. He was a member of the delegation who, on 1825, summed the second loan, £2,000,000. He returned to Greece on 1825 and continued representing Hydra at the National Assemblies.

== Life in independent Greece ==
Orlandos was a member of the [[English Party (Greece)|English Party]], considering the UK as the most effective country as of helping the revolution. He selected them due to the Kingdom's liberal political heritage and also its superiority in sea. Then he joined the anti-capodistrian faction stating that he preferred Greece a British protectorate instead of tolerating [[Ioannis Kapodistrias|Ioannis Kapodistrias']] authoritarian administration. So he took part in the anti-capodistrian demonstrations of Hydra, during the summer of 1831. After all these and in searching for [[Scapegoating|scapegoats]] to apologise for the loans, he and Louriotis were accused of wrongful administration. They were firstly acquitted but, in 1835 the court characterised them responsible for the loss of £28,769. On 1839 they published their huge apology in two volumes which they later renounced. On 1837 he was one of the founding members of the [[Archaeological Society of Athens]].

'''Jack Deveraux''' is a fictional character from the [[soap opera]] ''[[Days of Our Lives]]''. He once was the most prominent member of the [[Johnson family]] and is most famously played by [[Matthew Ashford]] from 1987 to 1993 and from 2001 to 2006, with a few minor breaks in between, in addition to a small guest stint in 2007. After a four-year absence, the character had recently returned to "Salem" to reconnect with his estranged family, beginning September 23, 2011. Ashford's return, however, was short-live, as, in April 2012, it was announced that he had been let go from the series, last appearing on August 15, 2012, where he was killed off. Ashford reprised the role for three days, appearing on May 24, 2016, June 20, 2016, August 5, 2016, and August 23, 2016, before making a final appearance on December 21, 2017. 

Many of his storylines have included his relationship with [[Jennifer Horton]], which has made up one of one the soap's most popular supercouples. They have two children together, [[Abigail Deveraux]] and [[JJ Deveraux]], in addition to a grandson, [[Days of Our Lives characters (2010s)#Thomas DiMera|Thomas DiMera]] and a granddaughter Charlotte DiMiera, through Abigail. One of the character's well known plots have been his fake deaths which occurred between 2003 and 2006, where he was presumed dead 3 times, which the actor found "hard to play" due to being unrealistic.

== Casting ==
At the character's inception in 1987, the role was recast two times, originated first by Joseph Adams from April 10, 1987 to July 17, 1987. Further, [[James Acheson (actor)|James Acheson]] played the role briefly from July 21, 1987 to October 26, 1987, before [[Matthew Ashford]] stepped into the role on October 30, 1987; Ashford notably went on to play the role through October 12, 1993, reappearing from February 5, 2001 to October 27, 2003 and June 22, 2004 until September 21, 2006, with a guest appearance on April 2–4, 2007 and again from September 23, 2011 until August 15, 2012. Ashford later took a brief absence from the series from October 2003 to June 2004 where he would appear as a special guest star on ''[[One Life to Live]]''.

Ashford was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in 2012. During Ashford's absence, the role of Jack was played by [[Mark Valley]] from October 28, 1994 until September 26, 1997, and by Steve Wilder from September 26, 1997 through June 5, 1998.

On November 30, 2015, it was announced that Ashford would briefly return to the soap; he appeared on May 24, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=SOD|title=MATTHEW ASHFORD BACK TO DAYS|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/matthew-ashford-back-days-0|accessdate=November 30, 2015|work=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|agency=[[American Media (publisher)|American Media Inc.]]|date=November 30, 2015|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Logan|first1=Michael|title=Matthew Ashford Returns to ''Days of Our Lives'' as Jack Deveraux|url=http://www.tvinsider.com/article/56606/matthew-ashford-returns-to-days-of-our-lives-as-jack-deveraux/|website=[[TV Insider]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=November 30, 2015|location=United States|date=November 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Who's Coming|department=Comings and Goings|pages=10–11|work=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|publisher=[[American Media (publisher)|American Media, Inc.]]|date=May 30, 2016|volume=41|issue=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashford also briefly appeared on June 20, 2016, August 5, 2016, and August 23, 2016.

==Characterization==
Charming, manipulative, heroic, clever, selfish, arrogant and self-loathing all at the same time, antihero Jack Deveraux is one half of [[Jack Deveraux and Jennifer Horton|Jack and Jennifer]], one of ''Days of our Lives''{{'}} most popular supercouples. Although he entered the story as an outright villain wedging himself violently in between another popular supercouple, [[Steve Johnson and Kayla Brady]], Jack eventually grew to establish himself as a core main character in the ''Days'' mythos through his passion, outrageous sense of humor, redemption, and undying love for heroine [[Jennifer Horton]].

The character has been a frequent winner of [[Soap Opera Digest Awards]], including Outstanding Villain, multiple wins for Best Love Story (with Jennifer), Best Wedding (also with Jennifer) and Outstanding Comic Performance. Ashford was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in 2012.

==Brief Character History==

When Jack came to Salem, he was seeking treatment for [[Hodgkin's disease]]. His father, [[Harper Deveraux]] hired [[Kayla Brady]] to be Jack's nurse, and when [[Steve Johnson (Days of Our Lives)|Steve "Patch" Johnson]] rejected her, she agreed to marry him. Unfortunately, the match was doomed. Kayla soon began cheating on Jack with Steve, and when he found out (from the newspaper, of all things), he raped her, and had Steve beaten up. A confrontation resulted in a fall off a roof, and Jack wound up needing a kidney. Unfortunately, the only viable donor was his birth brother, who just happened to be Steve (who only donated the kidney when their mother, Jo, asked him to). Kayla pressed charges (which were later dropped) and filed for divorce.

Sometime during this whole fiasco, Jack learned from [[Melissa Horton]], who he had turned to when his marriage had gone sour (not realizing that Harper was trying to frame her for poisoning Kayla), that he was adopted. He turned his back on Harper (who he found out was sterile.) He learned that Jo Johnson was his mother, and Steve and [[Adrienne Johnson Kiriakis|Adrienne]] his siblings. It was initially hard for him to accept, but Adrienne convinced Jack to at least try, and he made his mother's Christmas when he extended an olive branch...in the form of expensive emerald earrings.

Jack ran for his father's seat in the senate against [[Mickey Horton]], Melissa's adoptive father, using her to get to him. When she learned the truth, she dumped him. Then he saw his chance for big money...he helped [[Victor Kiriakis]] break Harper out of prison for a portion of his fortune, but the plan went bad, and Harper ended up kidnapping Kayla (again). Steve saved her, and his father went back to jail.

Jack bought half the ''Spectator'' to keep them from running a story about him. He attempted to blackmail co-partner [[Diana Colville]] into selling her other half. Originally she refused, but he later got his hands on it. The ''Spectator'' is where Jack met college student [[Jennifer Horton]]. She was trying to help a homeless pregnant girl named Sally, and the two pretended to be married to give the baby a home. Their fantasy love turned into a real thing, but the return of Jennifer's childhood sweetheart, Emilio, put a wedge between them. When Melissa returned to town, she tried to push Jennifer and Emilio together, and get Jack for herself, but he learned the truth, and kidnapped Jennifer on her wedding day.

Jack moved into Steve and Kayla's loft, and was interested to learn that Steve's ex, Marina, was blackmailing him into helping her find the family fortune. He broke a sane Isabella out of the asylum, and found out all about the treasure from her. After getting his hands on the key to the treasure, all he found was Loretta's diary...containing the secret to Isabella's paternity. Before giving her the diary, he removed those pages. Without revealing his identity, her father, Ernesto Toscano, planned a cruise to get revenge on his enemies and get the diary, inviting Jack, who took that opportunity to give Isabella the papers proving that Victor was her father. When a bomb exploded on board the ship, the passengers found their way to an island, where Jack and Jennifer made love. Jennifer agreed to marry Jack, and he was there for her when Ernesto took out himself and Jennifer's cousin [[Hope Brady]] (or so they thought...).

When Harper returned to town (after having escaped from prison), Jack foiled his plan to kill Steve during his second marriage to Kayla by pushing him off the roof of the bell tower...killing him. His own marriage plans were interrupted when Jennifer stepped in for her high-school chum Katerina von Leuschner (now known as Dr. [[Carly Manning]]) and married [[Lawrence Alamain]]. When she didn't come back, Jack went looking for her, and ended up in a cell next to Katerina's brother, François, who he later discovered was the Brady's adoptive son, [[Frankie Brady]]. The two managed to escape with the help of Lawrence's father, Leopold Alamain (who died in the attempt).

When Jack returned to Salem, he hoped to pick up where he left off with Jennifer, and began planning their wedding. When he tried to get romantic with her, she pushed him away, calling him a rapist. He didn't know what was going on, but Jennifer seemed to want nothing to do with him, so he broke it off. When he learned that the ''Spectator'' was in trouble, he married [[Eve Donovan]], who needed a husband to get her hands on Nick Corelli's fortune. Once Eve had her hands on the money, the marriage was annulled, and Jack again tried to get back with Jennifer. After nearly dying when the theme train they were in derailed, Jennifer finally admitted to Jack that she pushed him away because Lawrence had raped her. With [[Kimberly Brady]]'s help, Jack found a video of Lawrence confessing to the rape, and he was sent to prison.

Jack and Jennifer finally married in a wild west show. Honeymooning in [[Universal Studios]], they met Hawk Hawkins, a con man seeking to separate them from their money. With the help of his partner, Desirée, Hawk not only got himself a spot in the Deveraux home (after pretending he threw his back out at their place), but managed to convince Jack the FBI was after him. Jack fled, and Hawk managed to get hold of Jack's fortune. Before Hawk could leave Salem (with Jennifer in tow), Jack returned and convinced Hawk to admit to taking the money. Hawk went to jail, but Jack and Jennifer were still broke.

Finding out Jennifer was pregnant should have been the best moment of Jack's life, but he thought his Hodgkin's had returned, and that he would be leaving a widow with a baby girl. So he sold the ''Spectator'' to [[Julie Olson Williams]], before learning he wasn't dying after all. With no home and no money, they accepted [[Bill Horton (Days of Our Lives)|Bill Horton]]'s offer to move into a house he'd owned for years. [[Abigail Deveraux|Abigail Johanna Deveraux]] was born in a cabin outside of town, and Jack got a job freelancing. When he discovered a journal hidden in the attic of the house, he tried to have it turned into a novel, but [[Kate Roberts (Days of our Lives)|Kate Roberts]] turned him down, and then refused to return the manuscript. Unfortunately, Jack had been counting on that money...he'd stolen some money from [[Billie Reed]] (who was holding it for a crime boss) to buy the Spectator back, and had to sell it to Kate...who promptly fired him. When Jack learned shortly after that Abby had aplastic anemia, contracted because he had signed the wrong documents years before resulting in a polluted water well near their home, he decided Jennifer could never forgive him...and left Salem.

Jack wasn't seen or heard from for years, until he checked himself into The Meadows (using the name 'Clarke'), and met a woman named 'Monica'. The two realized they had a lot in common, and even became lovers. Imagine Jack's surprise when he found out Monica was none other than [[Laura Horton]], his mother-in-law who had been released from the mental hospital after he'd left town. Jack returned to town and moved into the house like he'd never left...uncomfortable for Jennifer and Peter, but ideal for Jack to get his wife back. He had no idea that his mother-in-law had fallen in love with him.

When [[Peter Blake (Days of Our Lives)|Peter Blake]] took Jennifer to his hometown of Aremid, Jack followed them, and befriended a young woman named Sarah, hoping she would help him. She told him all about the woman in white, but once it was discovered that she was dressing like her (she'd fallen in love with Jack), Jennifer and Peter discounted the story. The group returned to Salem, Sarah in tow. Jack hid her, until Peter found out and encouraged her to return to Aremid. After Hope saved her from stripping at the Blue Note, Jack took her back to Aremid. Later, he tried again in Aremid to break up Peter and Jennifer, until Peter revealed that Jack had an affair with Laura (to Laura). Also while in Aremid, Jack found the deed to the Blue Note with Peter's name on it (proving he was involved in his father's criminal activities), but before he could show Jennifer the pavilion caught fire...Jack was saved by Peter in the nick of time. Jennifer discovered Jack's affair with Laura when she walked in on Jack comforting her mother, and married Peter in her devastation (while Jack was in jail for arson, charges that were later dropped).

When [[Tony DiMera]] was murdered during the wedding reception and [[John Black (Days of Our Lives)|John Black]] the accused, Jack and Jennifer joined forces to prove his innocence. They went undercover at the Blue Moon, but just as they were about to prove Peter and Jude were linked, there was a police bust. Back in Aremid, Jude took Jennifer hostage, and Jack let him go to save Jennifer...who escaped on her own, complete with a matchbook containing the numbers to a bank account in the Cayman Islands. When the two went down there to check it out, Peter magically had the names on the account erased at the very moment they were accessing it. Then they learned that [[Bo Brady]] was looking for [[Hope Brady]], who had disappeared, in Aremid, and joined the search. Jack watches Peter shoot Jude in cold blood, but everyone believes that Peter did it in self-defense.

Jack followed Peter and Jennifer to Paris, still trying to prove that Peter was dirty. He found some books that could work as proof, but then Peter blew up the tunnels, and Jack and Jennifer barely escaped. Then Jack found Daniel Scott, the man Peter had hired to romance Laura. When Jack agreed to pay his debts (after luring him into a high-stakes poker game), Daniel confessed his dealings with Peter to Jennifer. She wouldn't believe his word alone, but Laura backed her up. After returning to Salem, Peter paid Daniel to tell Jennifer that Jack had bribed him to tell her those lies. Unluckily for Peter, Jennifer went to Daniel on her own, and tricked him into telling her everything. Jack had been planning to leave town until he learned that Jennifer kicked Peter out, and hung around to protect his ex-wife and daughter. He found out Peter was planning to kidnap Jennifer and Abby, but the police couldn't do anything. Jack headed over to the house with a gun, and accidentally killed Peter in a struggle. He was arrested for his murder, and bailed out by Jennifer. Too bad for Jack, Stefano had blackmailed a judge, and Jack was sentenced to life. His cellmate in prison was 'Travis Malloy', a plant from [[Stefano DiMera]]. When 'Travis' was released, he moved in next door to Jennifer, as Trent Davis.

The retrial began, and everyone figured that the charges would be dismissed because Peter was alive. [[Kristen DiMera]] even agreed to testify to that fact, but Stefano's presence scared her into silence. He was sent back to prison, and Jennifer got a job there to help him expose the prison system (using Hope's credentials). A crooked guard, T.C., was assigned to Jack and took a liking to Jennifer, even attempting to rape her. Jack saved her by bribing a guard to take him to the warden's office, and was paid back for it with a beating, not knowing Jennifer was hiding in his cell. T.C. and Trent searched Jennifer's home and discovered she was posing as a guard, and Jack's visitors were limited to one person...his lawyer, [[Mickey Horton]]. When Stefano decided (as part of a master plan) to become a respected resident of Salem, Jennifer told him that nothing better happen to Jack, because he needed the support of the Hortons. He called T.C. to tell him not to hurt Jack, which came just in time...they were seconds away from killing him. Jack realized that T.C. was on the DiMera bankroll.

Jack got himself a new cellmate, Herbie, who used his girlfriend on the outside to sneak Jack the password that Jennifer had stolen for the warden's computer. He used it, and learned that 'Travis' was living next door to Jennifer as Trent Davis. Unfortunately, by the time he got word to Mickey, Trent had kidnapped Jennifer. Finding that out, Herbie helped Jack break out of prison, and he headed to the Grand Canyon to save her. In a fight between Trent and Jack, Trent fell to his death. He and Jennifer returned to Salem to spend Christmas with their family, but Jack snuck away to catch Peter...not realizing that Abby and Jennifer had tagged along. They ended up at a seedy motel, Peter hot on their tail, and ended up being members of the Ward's World Famous Circus, where Jack got a job as an animal keeper. Laura accidentally sent Peter right to them, but luckily, circus owner Jasper saved them.

Jack convinced the circus to head to Salem, with a plan to trap Peter, and sent tickets to Hope to get her to come. Unfortunately, Peter had tipped the FBI off to where Jack was hiding, and had him arrested. Jack was heartbroken when Abe came to the jail to tell him that Jennifer's car had crashed, and a dead woman had been found inside...presumed to be Jennifer. Jack was released from jail just long enough to attend Jennifer's funeral. Jack was exonerated of his crimes when Jennifer's 'spirit' convinced Peter to confess to his crimes. Upon returning home, Jack and Abby found a very life Jennifer, who told them about the plan the circus people had to fake her death and resurrection. Jack, Jennifer, and Abby all left Salem in June of 1998 for a vacation in Africa.

While in Africa, something went wrong. The two never ended up getting married, and Jennifer ended up tending bar in Ireland. After Bo found her, she returned to Salem. Jack learned from Alice that she had gone to Paris for Greta's coronation, and turned up to try, one last time, to get his wife and daughter back. He has followed Jennifer back to Salem, and the two moved in together so they could look after Abigail. Jennifer initially pushed Jack away, and concentrated on relationships with first Brandon then Colin, but she and Jack couldn't resist that certain something that had always been between them. They were remarried, much to the delight of their daughter Abby.

Jack and Jennifer were just beginning to enjoy their married life together again, and to enjoy hosting In the House, a show that was one of Jennifer's father [[Bill Horton (Days of Our Lives)|Bill Horton]]'s wedding gifts to her and Jack. Then Jennifer was dealt the harshest blow of her life when Jack was struck down in an alley behind Salem Place by the Salem Stalker; however, unbeknownst to everyone in Salem, Jack wasn't really dead -- he'd been kidnapped to a tropical island that was the spitting image of Salem! He tried to escape to make it back to Jennifer, but ended up lost in the jungle surrounding the compound. Luckily Patrick, Jennifer and Hope were also out there in the jungle, and Jack was there just in time to meet his brand new son. While trying to get back to Salem, Jack and Jennifer were separated and Jack was presumed dead again, but ended up in Tony's European castle being held prisoner.

Not one to be down and out, Jack was still determined to get home to Jennifer, and escaped from the DiMera castle, trying to make his way back to Salem. After numerous failed attempts, Jack managed to pair up with [[Cassie Brady]], [[Marlena Evans]] and [[Roman Brady]], and the four eventually made it back to Salem. Jack was happy to be home with his wife and children, but he soon began feeling sick, and when he went in to Lexie, she advised him he only had a short period of time to live. Although Lexie and later Marlena tried to convince Jack to tell Jennifer, he was determined to enjoy the time he had left with his family without having them concentrate on his illness.

Convinced it was his job to make sure Jennifer was taken care of after his death, he began pushing Jennifer and Frankie to spend more time together. As soon as he thought the two were close again, Jack faked his death and "left" Salem, leaving Jennifer and Frankie to marry.

A few months later he encountered an orderly who looked exactly like his long-lost brother, [[Steve Johnson (Days of Our Lives)|Steve Johnson]]. It turned out that the orderly was Steve, and Jack insisted on a DNA test. Jack convinced Steve to return to Salem and reconnect with their family.

Jack returned during Jennifer's wedding to Frankie. Because her husband was still alive, Jennifer's marriage was invalid. Wanting Jennifer to be happy, Frankie found a cure for Jack's illness and Jack and Jennifer left for Europe together.

In the fall of 2010, Jennifer returned to Salem to settle [[Alice Horton]]'s estate. Jack was not with her. Jack had decided to go on a "walk about" in Australia to search for himself and find the meaning of life - or so we thought.

In the fall of 2011, Jack returned to Salem with the real story of where he was for a year. He had been working on a case involving drug trafficking in Europe. He traced the source of the drugs to Afghanistan, lied to Jennifer, Abigail, and [[JJ Deveraux]] about where he was going, and snuck into the country. He was soon captured, held prisoner, and tortured. His contact made up the story about the "walk about" and kept up that image so that Jack's family would not know about the news story. When Jack was finally released, he returned to Salem to tell everyone the truth. However, Jennifer had already divorced Jack and moved on with Daniel, and Abigail was furious with Jack for lying to the family. Neither was ready to trust Jack again.

Adamant that he had changed and would not lie again, Jack set about getting his family back. But, his first step was to deal with the trauma of being captured and tortured. Jack had developed PTSD. He worked with Marlena and a support group to recover. Eventually, he was able to open up to Jennifer about it.

This lead to the two of them reconciling and getting engaged. It also paved the way for Abigail and Jack to rebuild their relationship as well. And, Jack took a job teaching journalism at Salem U.

Jack and Jennifer supported [[Abe Carver]] through [[Lexie Carver]]'s terminal diagnosis and death. And, after she died, they attended a memorial/autism fundraiser. However, there was a great explosion that night in the tunnels underneath Salem. Many buildings were damaged, including the banquet hall where Lexie's benefit was being held. Abigail was trapped in the elevator.

Jennifer, Jack, and [[Cameron Davis (Days of Our Lives)|Cameron Davis]] worked to get Abigail out. When they were able to pry the doors open a little, Jack went into the elevator to rescue Abigail. But, the elevator cables continued to break. Cameron and Jennifer were able to open the doors again and Jack pushed Abigail out. Then, the doors closed and the final cables broke. The elevator crashed with Jack inside. Roman reported that the EMTs pronounced Jack dead upon impact.

'''Janis Anne Babson''' (September 9, 1950&amp;nbsp;– May 12, 1961) was a Canadian girl who received posthumous acclaim with the donation of her [[cornea]]s for [[Corneal transplantation|transplant]] after her death from [[leukemia]] at the age of 10. Her story was reported in a newspaper article syndicated across Canada, inspiring two books and other memorials. When Janis died of leukemia in 1961, corneal transplantation was a relatively unknown procedure. Although parents who lose young children frequently donate some of their organs to others, Janis's bequest was significant because the donation of her eyes at her death was her own idea, and it inspired many other people—across Canada and elsewhere—to become cornea donors as well.

==White Cane Week==
Janis happened to see a television program sponsored by an [[eye bank]] after watching ''[[National Velvet (TV series)|National Velvet]]'', a program she loved because of her passion for horses. When her youngest brother fell asleep on her lap, she did not want to wake him and remained in front of the television set when a White Cane Week&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccbnational.net/new/index.php?White_Cane_Week White Cane Week] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701171726/http://www.ccbnational.net/new/index.php?White_Cane_Week |date=July 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; special aired. The program's hosts explained how some cases of blindness could be cured with corneal donations, restoring a recipient's eyesight. After the program Janis, moved, told her mother and father that when she died she wanted to donate her eyes to the Eye Bank. Her parents—Harry Rudolphe (Rudy) Babson, a member of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and Rita Quinn Babson—knew their daughter was serious about the gift, but it was a big decision for such a young girl.

=={{anchor|Diagnosis of leukemia}}Leukemia==
In early 1959, when Janis was eight years old, her mother noticed that she had lost her energy and appetite. Her father took her to the family pediatrician who noted a great increase in [[white blood cell]]s from a sample he took. He ordered additional tests and referred her to [[Hematology|hematologist]] Alexander English at the [[The Ottawa Hospital|Ottawa Civic Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;Elliott 1964, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The tests revealed that Janis was suffering from a [[Acute lymphoblastic leukemia|sub-acute form of leukemia]]. At that time, leukemia was invariably fatal; with the chemotherapy available, Janis was expected to live about a year. She responded well to treatments which slowed the advance of the leukemia, and survived about 26 months after her diagnosis.

===Death===
[[File:Scan0001 - Copy.jpg|right|thumb|300px|alt=Cemetery headstone among others, with flowers|Gravesite of Janis Babson (and her father, Harry Rudolphe Babson), Notre Dame Cemetery, Ottawa]]
Despite a change in drugs from [[methotrexate]] to [[mercaptopurine]],&lt;ref&gt;Elliott 1964, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Janis's condition deteriorated in early 1961 as her leukemia worsened and she was hospitalized and released twice. In early May, she was hospitalized for the third (and final) time. Janis died in her parents' arms at 9:25 pm [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]] on Friday, May 12, 1961. Throughout her illness, Janis reminded her parents about her desire to donate her eyes; their original reluctance gave way when Rudy signed the consent forms for the donation of Janis's eyes a few hours before her death.

Janis is buried in [[Notre-Dame Cemetery (Ottawa)|Notre Dame Cemetery]] in [[Ottawa]]. Her funeral [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] was attended by her entire school.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott 1964, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Janis's best friend, Tricia Kennedy, moved from Ottawa to [[Chalk River]], Ontario with her family. When the Kennedys were interviewed by the local paper as part of a get-to-know-your-neighbours feature, Tricia Kennedy announced that her best friend had died of leukemia and donated her eyes to the Eye Bank in [[Toronto]]. Impressed, the reporter then contacted the ''[[Ottawa Journal]]''. Tim Burke, a reporter for the ''Journal'', contacted the Babsons; his interview became "Little Janis" in his May 31, 1961 "Below the Hill" column.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ottawasun.com/comment/columnists/pat_macadam/2009/08/15/10473196.html|title=Bidding friends farewell|author=Pat MacAdam|newspaper=Ottawa Sun|date=August 15, 2009|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The response was immediate: from Ottawa Mayor [[Charlotte Whitton]] to retired pharmacist Abe Silver (who created an endowment to Hebrew National University in Janis's name for leukemia research)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KdsxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=N-UFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4647,13883&amp;dq=janis-babson&amp;hl=en|title=Local Girl's Faith To Inspire Research|newspaper=Ottawa Citizen|date=July 3, 1961|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to groups and individuals who set a record for the number of pledged donations to the Eye Bank.

In 1962, the first of two books on Janis's life was published: ''Janis of City View'' (Holy Cross Press) by Rena Ray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/title/janis-of-city-view-the-story-of-the-little-crusader-who-donated-her eyes-to-the-eye-bank/oclc/49130798&amp;referer_results|last1=Ray|first1=Rena|title=Janis of City View|accessdate=April 23, 2013|year=1962|publisher=Holy Cross Press|location=[[Saint-Laurent, Quebec]]|oclc=49103798}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Lawrence Elliott, a correspondent for ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', published ''A Little Girl's Gift'' ([[Holt McDougal|Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/title/little-girls-gift/oclc/1293762|last1=Elliott|first1=Lawrence|year=1963|title=A Little Girl's Gift|publisher=Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston|location=New York|oclc=1293762|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six months earlier, a condensed version had appeared in the June 1963 issue of ''Reader's Digest'' entitled ''The Triumph of Janis Babson''.

=={{anchor|Modern tributes}}Tributes==
The Internet has spawned several websites dedicated to Janis Babson's memory. In addition, her family (mother and siblings) have created a memorial [[Facebook]] page where many whose lives were touched by Janis's can leave comments and posts. A 50th-anniversary tribute, arranged by the Babson family, was held May 27, 2011, in Ottawa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fpinfomart.ca/news/ar_results.php?q=5180481&amp;sort=pubd&amp;spell=1|title=One girl changed so many lives|author=Dave Brown|newspaper=Ottawa Sun|date=April 11, 2011}}{{subscription required|via=Ottawa Citizen}}&lt;/ref&gt; to commemorate a half-century since Janis's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourottawaregion.com/news/article/1023386--the-gift-that-keeps-giving|title=The gift that keeps giving|last1=McIntosh|first1=Jennifer|date=June 8, 2011|work=YourOttawaRegion.com|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured Lawrence Elliott, a new commemorative edition of ''A Little Girl's Gift'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elliott|first=Lawrence|url=https://www.amazon.com/Little-Girls-Gift-Lawrence-Elliott/dp/0976301652/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366747372&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=A+Little+Girl%27s+Gift|title=A Little Girl's Gift|accessdate=April 23, 2013|year=2011|publisher=Scrivana Press|isbn=978-0976301653}}&lt;/ref&gt; and artist Caroline Langill (''Custody of the Eyes'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ottawaartgallery.ca/publications/caroline_langill-en.php|publisher=Ottawa Art Gallery|location=Ottawa|title=Caroline Langill: Custody of the Eyes - Essays on Caroline Langill by Kathleen Garay and Caroline Langill|accessdate=April 23, 2013|isbn=1-895108-22-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large-cupped, broad-petalled [[daffodil]], white with pink rims, has been named after Janis as a tribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whiteflowerfarm.com/111560-product.html |work=White Flower Farm |title=Narcissus Janis Babson |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507063848/http://www.whiteflowerfarm.com/111560-product.html |archivedate=May  7, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3250">'''Jean Baptiste Joseph, chevalier de Laumoy''' (1750–1832) French engineer, fought in the [[American Revolutionary War]], and was on the staff of [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] and was captured with him, by the Austrians.

De Laumoy was the son of a French infantry captain. He entered the French military engineering school in 1760. He was assigned to America in 1777.  On 17 November Laumoy was commissioned Colonel of Engineers; he joined Washington's winter camp at Valley Forge.   The French engineers, '''de Laumoy''', La Radiere, and [[Louis Lebègue Duportail|Duportail]], provided knowledge of European fortifications and siege warfare.

Laumoy was deployed to the southern operations area on 8 February 1779; he advised [[Benjamin Lincoln]] at Charleston to surrender given the inadequate fortifications;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=deeAOjCEW1wC&amp;pg=PA101 David B. Mattern, ''Benjamin Lincoln and the American Revolution'', p.101]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0dHV8iVDxe4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA167 Carl P. Borick, ''A Gallant Defense'', p.169]&lt;/ref&gt; he was taken prisoner at the [[Siege of Charleston]] (12 May 1780);  he was exchanged on 26 November 1782. '''Laumoy''' was breveted Brigadier General on 30 September 1783, and honorably discharged from the US Army the following month.

He returned to France in December 1783. On 4 July 1784 he was awarded the [[Order of Saint Louis]], a distinction his father had also received. On 1 July 1785, Laumoy was made Aide maréchal général des logis at [[Saint-Domingue]]. Later, returning to France, he was Mestre de camp on 2 December 1787. For some months in 1788, he served on the army general staff. On 14 February 1789, he was second in command at Martinique, when the French suppressed a rebellion by island's large African slave and ex-slave population. As one of the hated administrators, Laumoy was obliged to return to France in May 1790.

For a while, Laumoy held a number of staff posts in the French Revolutionary Army. However, along with Lafayette, he was forced to flee in August 1792, and was captured by the Austrians, at [[Rochefort, Belgium]].  Upon release, he lived in exile, in Holland, but escaped to America when Napoleon invaded The Netherlands. '''Laumoy''' lived in Philadelphia until he was removed from the émigré list. He returned to France in the summer of 1801. He retired in 1810, and died 19 January 1832.

'''Jenny Visser-Hooft''' (née [[Jkvr]] '''Jeannette Hooft''' 18 June 1888, [[Kensington]] - 16 September 1939, [[Ankara]]) was a Dutch traveler, [[mountaineer]], and writer known for the [[flora]] and [[fauna]] research she did in the 1920s with her husband, [[Philips Christiaan Visser]], in Pakistan and India's [[Karakoram#Geology and glaciers|Karakorum Glaciers]] region.{{sfn|Netzley|2001|p=221}}

Visser-Hooft was the daughter of [[Jonkheer|Jhr]] Maurits Wijnand Hendrik Hooft and Jeannette Henriëtte Grader van der Maas, and was a descendant of [[P.C.

'''Jaromir "Jerry" Astl''' (born 1922) was a [[Czechoslovakian]] [[aeronautical engineer]] and explosive engineer who helped design the American [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]] nuclear propulsion spacecraft in the 1950s and 60s.

==Career==
Astl was born in 1922. After earning a degree in aeronautics in German-occupied Czechoslovakia, he worked as an engineer on the development of the Messerschmitt Me 262 Schwalbe jet fighter during World War II. At the same, Astl was a member of the Czech resistance movement involved in sabotaging communication lines with high explosives. He eventually went underground and joined the resistance movement full-time until the end of war. Following the war, Astl came under suspicion of dissidence by the new communist government and he eventually escaped through Soviet-occupied Austria. Astl arrived in the United States in April 1949 and worked in Baltimore, Maryland at a series of odd jobs including in a shoe factory, a printing plant and as a movie theater projectionist. In 1955, he obtained American citizenship and moved to the San Diego, California where he was employed as an aeronautical engineer with Rohr, Inc. working on the Lockheed Electra. He then moved to Ryan Aeronautical and Douglas Aircraft Company to work on the DC-8.

Asti was hired by General Atomic after it received funding to develop [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]]. Astl's work on Project Orion included three papers: Multi-ICBM Weapon System (November 1959), Nuclear Pulse-Propelled Vehicle Launching System (May 1960) and Split-Cylinder Long-Stroke Shock Absorber System (February 1961). His other major contribution was a proposed high-explosive test facility on the bluffs above La Jolla at Torrey Pines, San Diego. Jerry worked alongside [[Morris Scharff]] and [[Brian Dunne]] on the explosive experiments for Project Orion.

Astl left General Atomic in 1972 and became an independent consultant. He owns several patents, which include "Electromagnetic forming element" and "Differential pressure gauge".

==Documentary==
Astl was interviewed about his work with Project Orion in two television documentaries: History Undercover: Code Name Project Orion (1999) and To Mars by A-Bomb: The Secret History of Project Orion (BBC, 2003).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12331">'''Legal name''' is the [[name]] that identifies a person for legal, administrative and other official purposes. A person's first legal name generally is the name of the person that was given for the purpose of [[Civil registry|registration of the birth]] and which then appears on a [[birth certificate]] (see ''[[birth name]]''), but may change subsequently. Most [[Jurisdiction|jurisdictions]] require the use of a legal name for all legal and administrative purposes, and some jurisdictions permit or require a [[name change]] to be recorded at [[marriage]]. The legal name may need to be used on various government issued documents (e.g., a court order). The term is also used when an individual changes his/her first or full name, typically after reaching a certain legal age (usually eighteen or over, though it can be as low as fourteen in several European nations).

A person's legal name typically is the same as his/her [[personal name]], comprising a [[given name]] and a [[family name]]. The order varies according to culture and country. There are also country-by-country differences on changes of legal names by marriage. (See ''[[married name]]''.)

Most countries require by law the registration of a name for newborn children, and some can refuse registration of "undesirable" names. In 1991, a [[Sweden|Swedish]] couple refused to give their newborn a legal name, in protest of existing naming laws. In 1996, they were fined for not registering a name for their child for five years, after they unsuccessfully tried to register the child's name as [[Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Baby named Metallica rocks Sweden|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6525475.stm|accessdate=February 3, 2012|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=April 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then as "A".

==Jurisdiction by country==
===Canada===
====Quebec====
The ''[[Civil Code of Quebec]]'' states that "Every person exercises his civil rights under the name assigned to him and stated in his act of birth,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spouses retain their legal names upon marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|393}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be changed, upon registration, only under prescribed conditions, and only where the person is a Canadian citizen who has been domiciled in Québec for at least one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.etatcivil.gouv.qc.ca/en/change-name.html|title= Change of name|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 1 December 2016|website= etatcivil.gouv.qc.ca|location=Quebec|publisher= Directeur de l'état civil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In Germany, names are regulated to a large extent. Apart from possibly [[Married name#Germany|adopting the partner's name]] upon marriage, German citizens may only change their name for a recognised important reason. Among other reasons, a change of names is permitted when the name can give rise to confusion, ridicule, unusual orthographic difficulties, or stigmatization. In certain situations, children's last names may also be changed to their natural, foster or adoptive parent's last name. Transgender people may change their first names. Foreign names in writing systems that are not based on Latin are transliterated according to rules which may conflict with the system of transcribing or transliterating names that is used in the country of origin. Former titles of nobility became integrated into the last names in 1919 but continue to be adapted according to gender and other circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Seeger|first=Bernhard|title=Der Ehe- und Lebenspartnerschaftsname in der notariellen Praxis|year=2002|journal=Mitteilungen des Bayerischen Notarvereins|url=http://www.notare.bayern.de/read.php?datei=UERGUy9NaXR0QmF5Tm90L21pdHRCYXlOb3Q0XzAyLnBkZg==|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320233430/http://www.notare.bayern.de/read.php?datei=UERGUy9NaXR0QmF5Tm90L21pdHRCYXlOb3Q0XzAyLnBkZg==|archivedate=2012-03-20|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, businesses that trade under names other than those of the owner or a corporate entity must display the name of owner and an address at which documents may be served, or the name and registered number of the corporate body and its registered address. The requirements apply to sole traders and partnerships, but there are special provisions for large partnerships where listing all partners would be onerous. 

The information must be shown on any trading premises where the public have access to trade and in documents such as order forms, receipts and, as of January 2007, corporate websites (to be extended later in 2007 to sole trader websites).

====England and Wales====
In strict English law, if there is such a thing as a "''legal''" surname, it is easily changed. In the words of ''A dictionary of American and English law'', "Any one may take on himself whatever surname or as many surnames as he pleases, without statutory licence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Rapalje|first1= Stewart|last2= Lawrence|first2= Robert L.|date= 1997|title= A Dictionary of American and English Law with Definitions of the Technical Terms of the Canon and Civil Laws|edition= 3rd|volume= 2|location= [[Clark, New Jersey]]|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange|page= 849|isbn= 978-1-886363-33-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not always seem to have applied to names given in [[baptism]]. As noted by [[Edward Coke|Sir Edward Coke]] in ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'', "a man may have divers names at divers times, but not divers Christian names."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Butler|editor1-first=Charles|last= Coke|first= Edward|date= 1832|title= The First Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England|url= https://books.google.ca/books?id=NOgyAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;f=false|edition=19th|volume=1|location= |publisher= |at= Lib.1 Cap.1 Sect. 1, at 3.a|isbn= |author-link= Edward Coke}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But in modern practice all names are freely changeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/overview|title= Change your name by deed poll |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |access-date= 12 April 2017|website= gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes of name are usually effected through [[deed of change of name|deed poll]], optionally enrolled either at the [[High Court of Justice]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK | type = si| year = 1994| number = 604| si = Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; or at the [[College of Arms]],&lt;ref name="CONCOA"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/services/name-change|title= Changes of name|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= college-of-arms.gov.uk|publisher= [[College of Arms]]|access-date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a notice recorded in ''[[The London Gazette]]''. Changes may also be made by means of a Royal License obtained through the College of Arms, with similar notice.&lt;ref name="CONCOA"/&gt; These enrolment, licence and notice procedures are useful for having the new name appear in official documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/overview|title= Change your name by deed poll |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |access-date= 12 April 2017|website= gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
Scots Law allows anyone who wishes to do so to change their forename(s) or surname and such changes may be recorded in the official register held by the [[National Records of Scotland]].  Technically the Registrar General makes a correction to the entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/about-registration-in-scotland|title=About registration in Scotland|last=|first=|date=21 July 2018|website=National Records of Scotland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A correction can be recorded where a birth has been registered in Scotland, or where a person is the subject in Scotland of an entry in the Adopted Children Register, the Parental Order Register or the Gender Recognition Register.&lt;ref name="NRS"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/rcn1-leaflet.pdf |format=pdf |title=Leaflet RCN1: Recording changes of forename(s) and surname(s) in Scotland | publisher=National Records of Scotland |website=www.nrscotland.gov.uk |accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The above formalities are not necessary where a spouse/partner assumes the other spouse/partner's surname upon marriage or civil partnership, or reverts back to their original name upon separation, divorce or dissolution of the civil partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Recording Changes of Forename(s) and Surname(s) in Scotland|url=http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/recording-change-of-forename-and-surname-in-scotland|website=www.nrscotland.gov.uk|publisher=National Records of Scotland|accessdate=16 April 2017|date=2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one change of name is allowed in the register where a person has not yet reached the age of 16, and afterwards only one change of forename and three changes of surname may be granted during a person's lifetime, provided that at least five years have passed between changes of surname.&lt;ref name="NRS" /&gt; Name changes may also be recorded where:

* a decree or certificate has been granted by the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]],
* a certified copy of a [[Will (law)|will]], [[Settlement (trust)|settlement]] or [[Trust instrument|deed of trust]] is produced, containing a condition that the person concerned takes a name different from his or her registered name, or
* an alternative forename or surname is used where the registered name is not in an English-language form.&lt;ref name="NRS" /&gt;

====Northern Ireland====
Anyone born or adopted in Northern Ireland is able to change their name with the [[General Register Office (Northern Ireland)|General Register Office of Northern Ireland]] in the following circumstances:&lt;ref name="GRONI"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/recording-change-name|title= Recording a change of name|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 2015-10-26|website= nidirect.gov.uk|publisher= [[General Register Office (Northern Ireland)|General Register Office of Northern Ireland]]|access-date= 17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* a child's birth registration can be re-registered where its parents have subsequently married, or where a father that had not previously been identified is subsequently entered (whether by declaration, agreement or court order);
* a child's name can be changed once, before the age of 18, upon application by the parents (or adoptive parents, or guardian where the parents are deceased, as the case may be);
* a person aged 18 or over may apply to register one change of forename and three changes of surname during that person's lifetime, provided that at least five years have passed between changes of surname.

A deed poll can also be used in Northern Ireland for this purpose.&lt;ref name="GRONI"/&gt;

===United States===
Most states in the United States follow the [[common law]] which permits [[name change#United States|name changing]] for non-fraudulent purposes. This is actually the most common method, since most women who marry do not petition a court under the statutorily prescribed method, but simply use a new name (typically the husband's, a custom which started under the theory of [[coverture]] where a woman lost her identity and most rights when she married).&lt;ref&gt;''In re Natale'', 527 S.W.2d 402 (Mo. App. 1975); ''In re Kruzel'', 226 N.W.2d 458 (Wis. 1975).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most [[List of courts of the United States|state courts]] have held that a legally assumed name (i.e., for a non-fraudulent purpose) is a legal name and usable as their true name, though assumed names are often not considered the person's technically true name.&lt;ref&gt;''Stuart v. Board of Supervisors'', 295 A.2d 223 (Md. Ct. App. 1972); ''In re Hauptly'', 312 N.E.2d 857 (Ind. 1974); ''United States v. Cox'', 593 F.2d 46 (6th Cir. 1979).  ''See also'' 10 U.S.C. § 1551 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''legal name''' of a business is the name under which the business conducts its operations.

==Life==
Lin was of [[Teochew people|Teochew]] origin, and he was described as being from either [[Chenghai District|Chenghai]] or [[Huilai County|Huilai]] in [[Guangdong]].&lt;ref name="yen"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PIgGCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57|title=Ethnic Chinese Business In Asia: History, Culture And Business Enterprise |author= Yen Ching-hwang|page=57 |publisher= World Scientific Publishing Company|isbn=9789814578448 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xKfUBLmQJfwC&amp;pg=PT66#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Guangdong and Chinese Diaspora: The Changing Landscape of Qiaoxiang |author= Yow Cheun Hoe |publisher= Routledge |date=2013 |isbn=9781136171192 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he moved to [[Quanzhou]], [[Fujian]].&lt;ref name="tamaki"/&gt; Lin was part of the [[Jiajing wokou raids|''wokou'' piratical activity]] that plagued the Chinese coast during the reign of the Ming [[Jiajing Emperor]] (1522–1566). He attacked [[Zhao'an County|Zhao'an]] in 1563, where he was said to have burnt hundreds of houses killing thousands.&lt;ref name="ong-webb"/&gt; In response,  the Ming navy led by Yu Dayou drove Lin away first to [[Penghu islands]], later to [[Beigang, Yunlin|Beigang]], Taiwan.

According to Taiwanese accounts, Lin slaughtered many of the natives in Taiwan, using their blood as [[caulking|caulk]] for his ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5656984g/f103.image|page=5 |title=L'île Formose : histoire et description|author=Camille Imbault-Huart |date=1893 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:สุสันต์ ฮารี รายอ.jpg|thumb|[[Krue Se Mosque]] in [[Patani]], claimed by locals to have been built by Lin Daoqian]]
By the first half of 1570s, Lin was already operating in the Patani area, and the Ming authority joined force with the Siamese navy as well as using Portuguese ships to combat the pirates.&lt;ref name="wade"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PIDGBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Ghosts of the Past in Southern Thailand:  Essays on the History and Historiography of Patani |editor=Patrick Jory|publisher=NUS Press |date=30 August 2013|isbn= 978-9971696351 |pages=67&amp;ndash;69 |author=Geoff Wade }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1578, he established a base in Patani with 2,000 followers and they would dominate the town for some time.&lt;ref name="patani"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PIDGBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Ghosts of the Past in Southern Thailand: Essays on the History  and Historiography of Patani |author=Anthony Reid |editor=Patrick Jory|publisher=NUS Press |date=30 August 2013|isbn= 978-9971696351 |page=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ming sources indicate that he attacked Siamese ships but was repelled in 1578, and in 1580 he again attacked Siam but also left Siam later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The "Ming shi-lu" as a Source for Thai History: Fourteenth to Seventeenth Centuries |author=Geoff Wade|journal=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|volume= 31|number= No. 2 |date=September 2000|pages= 249–294 |jstor=20072252 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ming authorities tried to capture him while he continued to launch raids against Chinese ships in 1580–81. After 1581 there were no further reports of his piratical activity in Ming sources,  suggesting he had retired from raiding and settled in Patani. He obtained a fief and briefly established a small port near Patani, while members of his band gained prominence in the service of Patani's ruler.&lt;ref name="bradley"/&gt;  According to the local lore of Patani, he married the daughter of the Sultan, converted to Islam and built a mosque. He died in Patani, said to be due to cannon fire while he was testing cannons he had made.&lt;ref name="perret"&gt;{{cite book |author= Geoff Wade|date= 2004|chapter=From Chaiya to Pahang: The Eastern Seaboard of the Peninsula in Classical Chinese Texts|title= Études sur l'histoire du sultanat de Patani|editor=Daniel Perret|publisher=École française d'Extrême-Orient |pages=75–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lore and legends==
===In Taiwan===
There are a number of myths and legends about Lin in Taiwan.  It was said that while anchored at [[Kaohsiung|Takau]], Taiwan in 1563, Lin placed his treasure into eighteen and a half bamboo baskets, hiding them in the surrounding hills, and the [[Shoushan (Kaohsiung)|Takau Hill]] then acquired an alternate name Buried-Gold Hill (埋金山). Another story goes that Lin was told by a [[Taoist]] master that he would be able to conquer all of China if, after he had performed certain tasks in a hundred days, he fired three arrows towards [[Beijing]] on the dawn of the last day. The master gave him 3 magic arrows and a "divine rooster". Lin handed the rooster in the care of his sister Jin-lien (金蓮). On the midnight of last day, Jin-lien inadvertently startled the rooster, causing it to crow.  Lin awoke and mistakenly thought that dawn had arrived, immediately firing off three divine arrows with his name towards the imperial capital.  The three arrows flew into the imperial palace, striking the dragon throne. However, as it was midnight, the throne was empty. The emperor found the three arrows with Lin's name on them stuck in his throne, realizing that Lin had attempted to kill him, then ordered his troops to attack Lin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZznAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=大國海盜|author= 雪珥 |isbn=9789573272069 |pages=87&amp;ndash;88 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Patani===
[[File:Leng Chu Kiang Shrine in 2014.jpg|thumb|Shrine built in honour of Lim Ko Niao, said to be Lin Daoqian's sister]]
The Teochew people of Thailand tell a number of stories about Lin.  In one, he was said to have helped the Siamese fight off an [[Đại Việt|Annam]] attack and was thus given the daughter of the king to marry; however, he later angered the king after making a joke about killing the king, and had to flee.&lt;ref name="perret"/&gt; Another story involves the legend of Lin Guniang ([[Lim Ko Niao]]), said to be his sister in this account.  Lin Guniang tried to persuade her brother to return to China with her after finding that her brother had married  a local woman, converted to Islam as well as building a mosque in Kru Se, Patani.  However he refused,  fought and defeated her, and she then committed suicide by hanging from a tree.&lt;ref name="bradley"/&gt; Her gravestone, located next to the [[Krue Se Mosque]], is said to have been built by her brother. A shrine in her name exists in Patani and she is worshipped by some Chinese people in southern Thailand.&lt;ref name="tamaki"&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://www1.gsec.keio.ac.jp/imgdata/working/5_pdf.pdf |journal=G-SEC Working Paper|title=The prevalence of the worship of Goddess Lin Guniang by the ethnic Chinese in southern Thailand |author=Tamaki, Mitsuko|volume=22 |publisher=Global Security Research Institute|date= December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PIDGBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12 |title=Ghosts of the Past in Southern Thailand:  Essays on the History and Historiography of Patani |editor=Patrick Jory|publisher=NUS Press |date=30 August 2013|isbn= 978-9971696351 |pages=12–13 |author=Anthony Reid }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Phongsawadan muang pattani'' (Chronicle of Pattani), he attempted to cast three bronze cannons to be used in the wars of Patani. After several failures with the third cannon, he offered to sacrifice himself should his attempt be successful, and was blown up while testing the third cannon.&lt;ref name="perret"/&gt; A 19th century Chinese account claims that the ruler of Patani was his descendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PIDGBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Ghosts of the Past in Southern Thailand:  Essays on the History and Historiography of Patani |editor=Patrick Jory|publisher=NUS Press |date=30 August 2013|isbn= 978-9971696351 |pages=75–76 |author=Geoff Wade }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
It is thought that Lin's activity in the area may have influenced the migration of Teochew people to Thailand in later years.&lt;ref name="yen"/&gt; A Dutch merchant [[Olivier van Noort]] described a group of traders from Patani he met in Brunei in 1601 as being Chinese enough to have their own king and used the same laws as in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PIDGBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Ghosts of the Past in Southern Thailand: Essays on the History  and Historiography of Patani |author=Anthony Reid |editor=Patrick Jory|publisher=NUS Press |date=30 August 2013|isbn= 978-9971696351 |page=20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Dutch report of 1603 by [[Jacob Corneliszoon van Neck|Jacob van Neck]] estimated that there may be as many Chinese in Patani as there were native Malays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PIDGBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Ghosts of the Past in Southern Thailand: Essays on the History  and Historiography of Patani |author=Anthony Reid |editor=Patrick Jory|publisher=NUS Press |date=30 August 2013|isbn= 978-9971696351 |pages=22–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Malays in Kru Se, Patani claim descent from Lin, although they may have been descendants of his followers who married local women.&lt;ref name="perret"/&gt;

'''Madame Max Adolphe''' (also known as '''{{nowrap|Max Rosalie Auguste}}''' and '''{{nowrap|Rosalie Bosquet}}'''), born in September 1925,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://miningawareness.wordpress.com/2013/08/17/report-by-the-special-inquest-commission-on-the-troubling-death-of-judge-jean-serge-joseph-part-ii-the-facts/|title=Report by the Special Inquest Commission on the Troubling Death of Judge Jean Serge Joseph, Part II, The Facts|last=miningawareness|date=2013-08-17|website=Mining Awareness +|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the right hand woman of former [[Haiti]]an president [[François Duvalier]], who used the nickname "Papa{{nbsp}}Doc".

==Biography==
Adolphe, then known as Rosalie Bosquet, came to the attention of Duvalier during an attempt on his life. While she was a low ranking officer in the [[Tonton Macoute]], her courage impressed the President so much that he promoted her to the position of [[Prison warden|warden]] at {{nowrap|[[Fort Dimanche]]}}. At the prison, Adolphe continued her strong support of the government and was known for her violent interrogations of political prisoners. She was not viewed as a political threat to the President because of her sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brooke |first=James |date=1986-02-07 |title=Baby Doc follows Papa and Unleashes the Hated Tontons |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/122163121/ |newspaper=The Age |access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daily killings, torture, and beatings were typical at the prison during her tenure. She developed a "gruesome reputation for herself as she designed inventive sexual tortures" in Fort Dimanche.&lt;ref name="Girard 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Girard |first=Philippe R. |title=Africa and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History: A Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vbZzCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA392 |series=Transatlantic Relations Series |volume=1 |date=2008 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, California |isbn=978-1-85109-446-2 |lccn=2007035154 |oclc=168716701 |pages=392 |chapter=François Duvalier |editor1-last=Juang |editor1-first=Richard M. |editor2-last=Morrissette |editor2-first=Noelle}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was later promoted to the Supreme Head of the ''{{lang|fr|Fillettes Laleau}}'', the female branch of the [[Tonton Macoute]]s.&lt;ref name="Chardy 1986"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chardy |first=Alfonso |title=Duvalier left 'Madame Max' to wrath of native Haitians |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lbcwAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6710,4933788 |access-date=29 October 2015 |date=13 February 1986 |newspaper=Lakeland Ledger |location=Lakeland, Florida |agency=Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service |via=Google News}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also collected a monthly rent check from U.S. Special Forces for the use of her compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/haitian-lament-killing-me-softly |title=Haitian Lament: Killing Me Softly |work=The Nation |last=Coughlin |first=Dan |date=1999 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019160859/http://www.thenation.com/article/haitian-lament-killing-me-softly/ |archive-date=19 October 2015 |dead-url=no |quote=Madame Max Adolphe, for instance, the sadistic head of the [[Tonton Macoutes]] under [[François Duvalier|'Papa Doc' Duvalier]], collected a monthly rent check from US Special Forces for the use of her compound.

==Disappearance==
When Papa Doc died in 1971, and his son, [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]] succeeded him, he had Adolphe removed from her post as head of Fort Dimanche. By May 1972 she had been appointed mayor of {{nowrap|Port-au-Prince,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amnesty.ca/sites/amnesty/files/haitiduvalierreport11.pdf#page=33 |title='You Cannot Kill the Truth': The Case against Jean-Claude Duvalier |date=2011 |id=AMR&amp;nbsp;36/007/2011 |publisher=Amnesty International |location=London |page=31 |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151028143518/http://amnesty.ca/sites/amnesty/files/haitiduvalierreport11.pdf |archive-date=28 October 2015 |dead-url=no |quote=Max Rosalie Auguste, also known as 'Max Adolphe', for example, commander of the {{bracket|Tonton&amp;nbsp;Macoutes}} militia and Fort Dimanche prison under François Duvalier, was removed from her roles at the end of 1971.

Harrison has worked for six [[United Nations|UN]] agencies and travelled to many Third-World countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. In 1988 he received a UN Environment Programme Global 500 award for his writings on environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.global500.org/ViewLaureate.asp?ID=591 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622055130/http://www.global500.org/ViewLaureate.asp?ID=591 |archivedate=2011-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He edited the [[United Nations Population Fund]]'s "State of World Population," (1990 and 1992) and was editor-in-chief for the Independent Commission on Population and Quality of Life's report "Caring for the Future."

'''Potenciano Gregorio''', often referred to as '''Potenciano Gregorio Sr.''' (May 19, 1880 to February 12, 1939) was a [[Bikol language|Bicolano]] musician.  He was the composer of ''Sarung Banggi'' (One Evening), the most famous song in the [[Bikol language]].

Potenciano Gregorio was born in what was then known as the town of Lib-og (now [[Santo Domingo, Albay|Santo Domingo]]) in the province of [[Albay]] in the [[Philippines]].  His parents were Narciso Gregorio and Canuta Valladolid (some sources spell his mother's name as ''Balladolid'').  At an early age he learned to play the violin and was soon recognized for his talent.  He subsequently learned to play other instruments such as the bandurria, the guitar, and piano.  Later he started writing music for the local church by himself or in collaboration with his older brother Bernardo who organized the local band Banda de Lib-og. Potenciano later became the bandmaster of the same band until he joined the [[Philippine Constabulary Band]] in 1919.

It is claimed that Potenciano Gregorio composed ''Sarung Banggi'' when he was 17 years old.  There are different versions as to how he composed this song.  Hilario Balilo, the former town mayor stated that the composer wrote the music and lyrics of the song one night after hearing a bird chirping and the leaves rustling.  He based this version on information he received from Justo Gregorio, a nephew of Potenciano.  Resurrecion Gregorio, a grandson of Potenciano however claimed that the song was written during the 1897 eruption of Mayon volcano and initially the composer wanted to dedicate the song to his then fiancée Dominga Duran whom he later married.

Potenciano Gregorio later sold the rights to the song to [[Constancio de Guzman]].

He also wrote other songs like ''Pusong Tagub nin Sakit'' and ''Hinuyop-hoyop nin Dios''.

In 1919, he joined the Philippine Constabulary band under the tutelage of Col. [[Walter Loving]].

Potenciano Gregorio was among those invited to compete with other musicians during the Golden Gate International Exposition in 1938.  However, while he was overseas, he died in 1939 of pneumonia in Honolulu.  His remains were brought back to the Philippines and buried in La Loma Cemetery in [[Manila]].  In 2005, his remains were exhumed and brought to his hometown of Santo Domingo where they were reinterred.

In 1961, a fire hit Santo Domingo which destroyed Potenciano Gregorio's ancestral home.

'''Rye Barcott''' (born 1979) is a social entrepreneur and the author of the memoir ''It Happened on the Way to War''.  He previously co-founded [[Carolina for Kibera]] and Double Time Capital.  He was a human intelligence officer in the [[United States Marine Corps]], achieving the rank of captain.  Currently, he is the CEO of [[With Honor]], a new movement led by veterans focused on building a cross-partisan coalition of next-generation veterans in the [[United States Congress]] in order to help fix our America's broken, hyper-polarized politics.

==Background and early life==
Barcott was born in Rhode Island. His father attended [[Miami University]] on an [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] scholarship and went on to serve in the Marines' [[3rd Reconnaissance Battalion]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. His father left the Marines as a captain after receiving a [[Bronze Star Medal]] and a [[Purple Heart]] in combat. His parents met as graduate students at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. Barcott's mother is a nurse and anthropologist who teaches at the [[University of Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.uri.edu/nursing/meet/donna-schwartz-barcott-ph-d-r-n/ |title=Professor Donna Schwartz-Barcott URI profile|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barcott initially applied to the [[United States Naval Academy]] but was turned down. As a result, he instead applied for an NROTC scholarship to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].

==Education==
Barcott attended [[East Greenwich High School]]. He graduated in 2001 from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where he studied economics and anthropology.  He attended [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC]] on a four-year [[U.S. Marine Corps]] [[NROTC]] Scholarship.  In 2009, Barcott graduated with an MPA and MBA from [[Harvard University]] as a Center for Public Leadership Social Entrepreneurship Fellow and George Leadership Fellow.  [[Harvard University]] President [[Drew Faust]] appointed him to a two-year term on the [[Harvard]] Endowment's Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, and he served as a founding member of the movement to create an [[MBA Oath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mbaoath.org/about/who-we-are/|title=Who We Are - The MBA Oath|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected as a member of the [[Harvard University]] Alumni Association Board of Directors in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HAA Board of Directors|url=https://alumni.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/page/HAA%20Board%20for%20web_121417.pdf|website=alumni.harvard.edu|accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;_

==Military service==
Barcott served five years on active duty in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], where he attained the rank of captain and deployed to [[Bosnia]], the [[Horn of Africa]], and [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pritzkermilitary.org/whats_on/pritzker-military-presents/rye-barcott-it-happened-way-war/ Barcott on ''It Happened on the Way to War'' at the Pritzker Military Museum &amp; Library]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he provided written testimony to the [[Iraq Study Group]] and authored an article about the Iraqi Military Intelligence Academy in [[Proceedings (magazine)|Proceedings]], the professional journal of the U.S. Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barcott|first1=Rye|title="No Torture"-It's a Start|url=https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2007-07/no-torture—-its-start|website=usni.org|publisher=Proceedings Magazine|accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[ABC World News with Charles Gibson]] covered his work in Kibera and his military service in Iraq and named him a Person of the Week and a 2006 Person of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/PersonOfWeek/story?id=2611995&amp;page=1|title=American in Iraq Fights Two Wars at Once|date=4 May 2007|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ABC World News story quoted him encouraging young Americans to expose themselves "to how the majority of the world lives … and I think it'll make you a lot more appreciative of what you've got … make you a better American and a better global citizen."

The [[U.S. Department of Defense]] awarded Barcott with the [[Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal]]. The President of the United States appointed him to the [[J. William Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board]] as a representative of the veteran community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President Obama Announces More Key Administration Posts|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/02/president-obama-announces-more-key-administration-posts|website=ObamaWhiteHouseArchives.gov|publisher=The White House, Office of the Press Secretary|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''It Happened on the Way to War'' was one of four books selected for the TED 2011 Book Club, and was named best nonfiction title in 2011 by the North Carolina Literary and Historical Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North Carolina Literary and Historical Association Award Winners Database|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18GfAPMi4QjiZZ_HG13UrW1kOzGR9VKzwatUhnNJf5m0/edit#gid=0|website=ncdcr.gov|accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, [[Reader's Digest]] named the book as one of four top nonfiction titles of the year.

[[Dartmouth College]] awarded Barcott a Doctorate of Humane Letters in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Silverstein|first1=Hannah|title=Nobel Laureate Leymah Gbowee to Speak at Commencement|url=https://news.dartmouth.edu/news/2016/04/nobel-laureate-leymah-gbowee-speak-commencement|website=News.Dartmouth.edu|accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social enterprise and career==
===Carolina for Kibera===
While an undergraduate at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC]] in 2001, Barcott founded [[Carolina for Kibera]] (CFK) in Kenya with Salim Mohamed and Tabitha Atieno Festo. CFK started as a small inter-ethnic soccer program and medical clinic run out of Festo's ten-by-ten foot shack. Today it is a major affiliated entity of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. More than 5,000 youth participate in its holistic youth programs, and the Tabitha Clinic treats more than 20,000 patients a year in collaboration with the [[U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartglobalhealth.org/blog/entry/cdc-carolina-for-kibera-tabitha-health-clinic/ Center For Strategic and International Studies, The Commission on Smart Global Health Policy, August 10, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Double Time Capital===
Barcott co-founded Double Time Capital in 2013 as an impact investment firm focused on clean energy and sustainability. As of February 2017, "Double Time has financed 36 solar energy projects, which collectively produce roughly 10% of North Carolina's solar power and power around 30,000 homes in the state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quittner|first1=Jeremy|title=These Marines Beat the Odds to Build a Solar Energy Fund|url=http://fortune.com/2017/02/22/marines-solar-energy-fund/|website=Fortune.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, North Carolina was the second ranked state in the United States based on the cumulative amount of solar electric capacity installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North Carolina Solar|url=https://www.seia.org/state-solar-policy/north-carolina-solar|website=SEIA.org|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===With Honor===
Barcott co-founded With Honor in 2017 with [[David Gergen]] and other veterans. [[With Honor]] is a cross-partisan movement led by veterans focused on increasing the number of next-generation veterans in Congress in order to advocate for changes in America's politics. With Honor's advisory board includes post-9/11 veterans, Gold Star family members, and other prominent American public figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=With Honor Advisors|url=https://www.withhonor.org/about-us/our-advisors|website=WithHonor.org|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
William Preston was born on Christmas Day, 1729, in [[Limavady]], Ireland, to [[Colonel (U.K.)|Col]]. [[John Preston (settler)|John Preston]] and his wife Elizabeth. Elizabeth's father [[Henry Patton (shipwright)|Henry Patton]] was a prominent shipwright and merchant, and her brother [[James Patton (Royal Navy officer)|James Patton]] served with such distinction in the [[Royal Navy]] that the Crown granted him between 100,000 and 120,000 acres in America to permit [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonization]] beyond the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;Preston, F.L. "[http://www.suddenlink.net/pages/fpreston/sfjohn.htm John Preston 1699-1747]". 2007. Accessed 28 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The family immigrated to [[Augusta County, Virginia|Augusta Co]]., [[Virginia Colony|Virginia]], in 1738 on James's ship.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn, Richard Charles. ''William Preston of Virginia, 1727–1783: The Making of a Frontier Elite.''1990, Dissertation, University of Maryland College Park. pages 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent [[French and Indian War|French and Indian resistance]] and [[Royal Proclamation of 1763|reversal of British policy]] limited the impact of the family's grants, but [[Prestonsburg, Kentucky]], was named in John's honor by its later founders.&lt;ref name=ren&gt;Rennick, Robert. ''Kentucky Place Names'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=3Lac2FUSj_oC&amp;pg=PA242 p. 242]. University Press of Kentucky (Lexington), 1987. Accessed 1 Aug 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1755, he survived the [[Draper's Meadow massacre]], an Indian attack against a settlement that was part of a property (later known as  [[Smithfield (Blacksburg, Virginia)|Smithfield Plantation]]) that he inherited from his uncle, Colonel James Patton, who died in the incident.

Remaining in Virginia, William married Susanna Smith on January 17, 1761, and together they had 12 children.  He and his family moved to Smithfield Plantation, in present-day [[Blacksburg, Virginia]], in 1774 and it served as his final home.&lt;ref&gt;Family Tree, Historic Smithfield Plantation Museum&lt;/ref&gt;  He previously resided at [[Greenfield (Fincastle, Virginia)|Greenfield Plantation]] at [[Fincastle, Virginia|Fincastle]], [[Botetourt County, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=VAnom&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Botetourt/011-0026_Greenfield_2010_NRHP_FINAL.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Greenfield |author=Michael J. Pulice &amp; John R. Kern |date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and military life==
Colonel Preston was elected to the Virginia colony's [[House of Burgesses]] in 1765 to represent [[Augusta County, Virginia|Augusta County]] and served until the county was divided around 1770.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Patricia Givens. ''William Preston and the Allegheny Patriots,'' 1976. pages 89–108&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1775, Preston was one of the thirteen signers of the [[Fincastle Resolutions]].

Colonel Preston served in both the [[French and Indian War]] and [[American Revolutionary War]]. During the French and Indian War, William Preston saved [[George Washington]]'s life from an impending Indian attack.&lt;ref&gt;spoken family history&lt;/ref&gt;  During [[Lord Dunmore's War]] of 1773-1774 against the [[Shawnee Indians]], he urged Virginians to join the militia to enact revenge on the Indians and plunder their stock of horses. As a Colonel in the militia, one of Colonel Preston's greatest contributions to the [[American Revolutionary War]] was his ability to suppress the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tories]] (British loyalists) from uprising in Southwest Virginia, thus helping prevent a civil war during the Revolution.  He also helped aid in the fight against [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]] and the British in the Carolinas.&lt;ref&gt;''The Smithfield Review, Volume XII.'' "William Preston, Revolutionary (1779–1780)," Richard Osborn. pages 5–24&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as a founding trustee of Liberty Hall, formerly the Augusta Academy, when in 1776 it was renamed in a burst of revolutionary fervor and relocated to [[Lexington, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="wlu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlu.edu/x22.xml |title=A History :: Washington and Lee University |publisher=Wlu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wlu.edu"/&gt; Other founding trustees along with Preston were prominent men including [[Andrew Lewis (soldier)|Andrew Lewis]], [[Thomas Lewis (Virginia)|Thomas Lewis]], [[Samuel McDowell]], [[Sampson Mathews]], George Moffett, and [[James Waddel]].&lt;ref name="Lex"/&gt; Finally chartered in 1782, Liberty Hall was again renamed, to Washington College and finally [[Washington and Lee University]]. It is the ninth oldest institution of higher education in the country.&lt;ref name="wlu.edu"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Colonel Preston died during a military muster near Price's Fork, Va., in 1783. The cause of death is unknown but it is believed to be either a heat stroke or a heart attack.  He is buried in the family cemetery located on [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Tech]]'s campus in [[Blacksburg, Virginia]] near [[Smithfield (Blacksburg, Virginia)|Smithfield Plantation]].  His final home, [[Smithfield (Blacksburg, Virginia)|Smithfield Plantation]], has been restored and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places|U.S. Historical Registry]], and is open for tours April through the first week in December.

Many other prominent Americans descended from Colonel William Preston and his wife Susanna, for whom the plantation is named.  They were parents or grandparents to governors, senators, presidential cabinet members, university founders and presidents, and military leaders.  Most notably among them are the Prestons' son [[James Patton Preston]], who was governor of Virginia from 1816–1819 and helped charter the [[University of Virginia]], and their grandson [[William Ballard Preston]], who was a Congressman, Secretary of the Navy under [[Zachary Taylor]], and later a Senator from the Confederate States of America.  William Ballard Preston also offered the Ordinance of Secession to the Virginia Legislature that resulted in Virginia joining the Confederacy, and he co-founded a small Methodist college, the [[Olin and Preston Institute]], which was in financial difficulty by 1872.  The trustees  relinquished its charter and donated its property to the state, which reorganized the campus as the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College, the forerunner what is today Virginia Tech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Duncan Lyle | last=Kinnear | title=A Short History of Virginia Tech | publisher= | url =http://spec.lib.vt.edu/archives/125th/kinnear/prefound.htm | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2017-09-15 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Colonel Preston was memorialized on July 27, 2011 with the Colonel William Preston highway in [[Blacksburg, Virginia]].

The city of [[Prestonville, Kentucky]], was erected on one of his land grants and named in his honor. It was (before 1800) the most important town in the county and larger than [[Carrollton, Kentucky|Port William]]. One of the first roads built in this section of the state was from the mouth of the Kentucky to [[New Castle, Kentucky|New Castle]] in [[Henry County, Kentucky|Henry County]].
