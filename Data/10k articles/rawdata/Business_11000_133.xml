      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18380">'''Active listening''' is a technique that is used in [[counseling]], training, and [[solving disputes or conflicts ]]. It requires that the listener fully concentrate, understand, respond and then remember what is being said.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Active Listening Presentation|url = http://www.slideshare.net/kdbourque/active-listening-presentation-36893005|date = 2014-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is opposed to [[reflective listening]] where the listener repeats back to the speaker what they have just heard to confirm understanding of both parties.

==Comprehending==

Comprehension is shared meaning between parties in a communication transaction. This is the first step in the listening process. The second step is being able to take breaks between discernible words, or talking segmentation.

==Retaining==
Retaining is the second step in the process. Memory is essential to the listening process because the information retained when a person is involved in the listening process is how meaning from words is created. Because everyone has different memories, the speaker and the listener may attach different meanings to the same statement. However, memories are fallible, things like [[Cramming (education)|cramming]] may cause information to be forgotten.

==Responding==

Listening is an interaction between speaker and listener.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Listening: Processes, Functions and Competency |last=Worthington |first=Debra |publisher=Routledge |year=2016 |isbn=9780132288545 |location=New York |pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; It adds action to a normally passive process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Tactic==
Active listening involves the listener observing the speaker's [[behavior]] and [[body language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Project Management Concepts, Methods, and Techniques |last=Maley |first=Claude |publisher=CRC Press|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4665-0288-8|location=|page=417|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having the ability to interpret a person's body language lets the listener develop a more accurate understanding of the speaker's message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Atwater |first=Eastwood |title=I Hear You |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1981 |isbn=0-13-450684-7 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having heard, the listener may then [[paraphrase]] the speaker's words. It is important to note that the listener is not necessarily agreeing with the speaker—simply stating what was said.

Individuals in conflict often [[contradict]] each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Leadership in Health Care |last=Barr |first=Jill |last2=Dowding |first2=Lesley |publisher=Sage |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-4739-0455-2 |location=|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambushing occurs when one listens to someone else's argument for its weaknesses and ignore its strengths.&lt;ref name="Rothwell, 2010"&gt;{{cite book |title=In the Company of Others: An Introduction to Communication |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=2010 |pages=157–66 |isbn=0-19-533630-5 |oclc=276930486 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may include a distortion of the speaker's argument to gain a competitive advantage. On the other hand, if one finds that the other party understands, an atmosphere of [[cooperation]] can be created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fisher |first=Roger |last2=Ury |first2=William |title=Getting to Yes |publisher=Random House |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Leader Effectiveness Training'', [[Thomas Gordon (psychologist)|Thomas Gordon]], who coined the term "active listening",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Points of influence: a guide to using personality theory at work |last=Segal |first=Morley |year=1997 |publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=978-0-7879-0260-5 |page=215 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iPZGAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22active+listening%22+Gordon+coined&amp;dq=%22active+listening%22+Gordon+coined&amp;cd=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; states "Active listening is certainly not complex. Listeners need only restate, in their own language, their impression of the expression of the sender. ... Still, learning to do Active Listening well is a rather difficult task ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Leader Effectiveness Training |last=Gordon |first=Thomas |year=1977 |publisher=Wyden books |location=New York |isbn=0-399-12888-3 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Active listening is used in a wide variety of situations, including public interest advocacy, community organizing, [[tutoring]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Maudsley G |title=Roles and responsibilities of the problem based learning tutor in the undergraduate medical curriculum |journal=BMJ |volume=318 |issue=7184 |pages=657–61 |date=March 1999 |pmid=10066213 |pmc=1115096 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10066213 |doi=10.1136/bmj.318.7184.657}}&lt;/ref&gt; medical workers talking to patients,&lt;ref name=floyd&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lang F, Floyd MR, Beine KL |title=Clues to patients' explanations and concerns about their illnesses.

[[counseling]]{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} and [[journalistic]]{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} settings. In groups it may aid in reaching [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} It may also be used in casual [[conversation]] or [[small talk]] to build understanding, though this can be interpreted as condescending.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

A listener can use several degrees of active listening, each resulting in a different quality of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technical Communication for Engineers|last=Verma|first=Shalini|publisher=Vikas|year=2015|isbn=978-93259-9018-0|location=India|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proper use of active listening results in getting people to open up, avoiding misunderstandings, resolving conflict, and building [[Trust (sociology)|trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Active Listening|url=http://www.whitedovebooks.co.uk/books/Active-Listening/page_1.html|work=Inspiration|publisher=White Dove Books|accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a medical context, benefits may include increased patient satisfaction,&lt;ref name="floyd"/&gt; improved [[cross-cultural communication]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Davidhizar R |title=Listening – a nursing strategy to transcend culture |journal=J Pract Nurs |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=22–4; quiz 26–7 |year=2004 |pmid=15460343}}&lt;/ref&gt; improved outcomes,&lt;ref name="floyd"/&gt; or decreased [[litigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robertson K |title=Active listening: more than just paying attention |journal=Aust Fam Physician |volume=34 |issue=12 |pages=1053–55 |year=2005 |pmid=16333490 |url=http://www.racgp.org.au/AM/Template.cfm?Section=200512&amp;Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=5780 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Active listening can be lifted by the active listening observation scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fassaert T, van Dulmen S, Schellevis F, Bensing J |title=Active listening in medical consultations: development of the Active Listening Observation Scale (ALOS-global) |journal=Patient Educ Couns |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=258–64 |year=2007 |pmid=17689042 |doi=10.1016/j.pec.2007.06.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barriers to active listening==
Some barriers are due to hunger or [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] of the listener, making them irritated and less inclined to listen to the speaker. Sometimes it is due to the language the speaker uses—such as high sounding and bombastic words that can lead to [[ambiguity]]. Other barriers include distractions, [[trigger word]]s, vocabulary, and limited attention span.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author =Reed, Warren H. |title=Positive listening: learning to hear what people are really saying |publisher=F. Watts |location=New York |year=1985 |isbn=0-531-09583-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Listening barriers may be psychological (e.g., emotions) or physical (e.g., noise and visual distraction).{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Shift response===
Shift response is the general tendency of a speaker in a conversation to affix attention to their position.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} This is a type of [[conversational narcissism]]—the tendency of listeners to turn the topic to themselves without showing sustained interest in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The pursuit of attention: Power and individualism in everyday life |last=Derber |first=C. |year=1979 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A support response is the opposite of a shift response; it is an attention giving method and a cooperative effort to focus the conversational attention on the other person. Instead of being me-oriented like shift response, it is we-oriented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vangelisti |first1=A. |last2=Knapp |first2=M. |last3=Daly |first3=J. |year=1990 |title=Conversational narcissism |journal=Communication Monographs |volume=57 |pages=251–74 | doi = 10.1080/03637759009376202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the response a competent communicator is most likely to use.&lt;ref name="Rothwell, 2010"/&gt;

===Understanding of non-verbal cues===

Ineffective listeners are unaware of non-verbal cues, though they dramatically affect how people listen. To a certain extent, it is also a perceptual barrier. Up to 93 percent of people's attitudes are formed by non-verbal cues. This should help one to avoid undue influence from non-verbal communication. In most cases, the listener does not understand the non-verbal cues the speaker uses. A person may show fingers to emphasize a point, but this may be perceived as an intent by the speaker to place their fingers in the listener's eyes. Overuse of non-verbal cues also creates [[distortion]], and as a result listeners may be confused and forget the correct meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Communication Skills,  Nageshwar Rao, Rajendra P. Das, Himalaya publishing House, 2012, {{ISBN|9789350516669}}, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overcoming listening barriers==
The active listening technique is used to improve personal communications in organizations.  Listeners put aside their own emotions and ask questions and paraphrase what the speaker says to clarify and gain a better understanding of what the speaker intends to say.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Project Management: A Systems Approach to Planning, Scheduling, and Controlling|last=Kerzner|first=Harold|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judging or arguing prematurely is a result of holding onto a strict personal opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lama|first=Dalai|title=Top 3 Barriers to Effective Listening|url=http://www.people-communicating.com/barriers-to-effective-listening.html|publisher=People Communicating| accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hinders the ability to be able to listen closely to what is being said.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Eye contact and appropriate body languages are seen as important components to active listening.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The [[stress (psychological)|stress]] and [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] may also keep them active and away from distractions.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Misconceptions about listening==
There are several misconceptions about listening.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} One does not control what one ''hears'', {{citation needed|date=March 2014}} whereas ''listening'' is an active process that constructs meaning from both verbal and nonverbal messages.&lt;ref name="Rothwell, 2010"/&gt;

==Active listening in music==
Active Listening has been developed as a concept in music and technology by [[François Pachet]], researcher at [[Sony]] Computer Science Laboratory, Paris. Active listening in music refers to the idea that listeners can be given some degree of control on the music they listen to, by means of technological applications mainly based on [[artificial intelligence]] and [[information theory]] techniques, by opposition to traditional listening, in which the musical media is played passively by some neutral device&lt;ref&gt;[[François Pachet]] [http://www.csl.sony.fr/downloads/papers/2010/pachet-10b.pdf The Future of Content is in Ourselves]. The Future of Content is in Ourselves. In M. Tokoro, editor, Open System Science, pp. 133–58, IOS Press. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[François Pachet]] [http://www.csl.sony.fr/downloads/papers/uploads/pachet-99a.pdf Active Listening: What is in the Air?].In Miranda, E., editor, Musica y Nuevas Tecnologias: Perspectivas para el Siglo XXI, L'Angelot. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[François Pachet]] [http://www.csl.sony.fr/downloads/papers/1999/pachet-paclp1999.pdf Constraints for Multimedia Applications]. Proceedings of PACLP 1999, London, March 1999. The Practical Application Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Carl Rogers and Richard Farson coined the term "active listening" in 1957 in a paper of the same title (reprinted in 1987 in the volume “Communicating in Business Today”). They write: "Active listening is an important way to bring about changes in people. Despite the popular notion that listening is a passive approach, clinical and research evidence clearly shows that sensitive listening is a most effective agent for individual personality change and group development. Listening brings about changes in peoples’ attitudes toward themselves and others; it also brings about changes in their basic values and personal philosophy. People who have been listened to in this new and special way become more emotionally mature, more open to their experiences, less defensive, more democratic, and less authoritarian."

==Criticism==
A Munich-based [[marital therapy]] study conducted by Dr. Kurt Hahlweg and associates found that even after employing active listening techniques in the context of couple's therapy, the typical couple was still distressed.&lt;ref&gt;Halhweg, K., Schindler, L., Revenstorf, D., &amp; Brengelmann, J.C. (1984). The Munich Marital Therapy Study. In K. Hahlweg &amp; N.S. Jacobson (Eds.), Marital Interaction: Analysis and Modification (pp. 3–26), New York: Guilford Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; Active listening was criticized by [[John Gottman]]'s ''[[The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work]]'' as being of limited usefulness: {{quote|Active listening asks couples to perform Olympic-level emotional gymnastics when their relationship can barely walk. . . . After studying some 650 couples and tracking the fate of their marriages for up to fourteen years, we now understand that this approach to counseling doesn't work, ''not just'' because it's nearly impossible for most couples to do well, but more importantly because ''successful conflict resolution isn't what makes marriages succeed''. One of the most startling findings of our research is that most couples who have maintained happy marriages rarely do anything that even partly resembles active listening when they're upset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work|author =Gottman, John|date=16 May 2000|pages=10–11|isbn=978-0-609-80579-4|publisher=Harmony Books|chapter=Inside the Seattle Love Lab: The Truth about Happy Marriages}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Robert F. Scuka defends active listening by arguing that: {{quote|...a careful reading of the Hahlweg et al. (1984) study reveals that Gottman cites only certain (one-sided) results from the study. He also overlooks several important considerations that call into question his implied dismissal of the RE model as a legitimate therapeutic intervention for distressed couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author =Scuka, Robert F.|title=Relationship Enhancement Therapy|date=28 May 2005|chapter=The Munich Group Study}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Background==
An [[Ismaili]] [[Muslim]] born in [[East Africa]], Bhatia was educated in schools in [[Tanzania]] and [[India]]. He is married to Nurnamu Amersi and has three daughters. He moved to the United Kingdom in 1972.

==Career==
Bhatia was Chairman and managing director of [[Forbes Campbell International]] Ltd between 1980 and 2001. He was the co-founder of the [[Ethnic Minority Foundation]] and its chair until 2009, and also helped establish the Council of Ethnic Minority Voluntary Sector Organisations (CEMVO). He is additionally a former trustee of various charitable organisations, including the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] Charities Board and [[Oxfam]], serving as Chairman of Oxfam Trading.

In 2006 he was the chair of the [[British Edutrust]] foundation, the organisation planning to sponsor [[Rhodesway School]]. He stepped down from the post in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Honours==
Bhatia was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[1997 Birthday Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=54794 |date=14 June 1997 |page=10 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 June 2001, he was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Bhatia''', ''of [[Hampton, London|Hampton]] in the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=56232 |date=13 June 2001 |page=6953}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the first '[[people's peers]]'. He sat in the [[House of Lords]] as a [[crossbencher]]. 

In 2003 Lord Bhatia received the Beacon Fellowship Prize for his leadership role in countering social deprivation and exclusion in the UK and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beaconfellowship.org.uk/press_releases.asp?rel=1029 Lord Bhatia – The Beacon Prize for Leadership], Beacon Fellowship. Retrieved 2 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In October 2010 Lord Bhatia was suspended for 8 months from the House of Lords due to the [[United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal]].&lt;ref name=bbc-20101021&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11597922 |title=Three peers suspended from Lords over expenses claims |publisher=BBC |date=21 October 2010 |accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, Lord Batia sits in the House of Lords as a [[Non-affiliated members of the House of Lords|non-affiliated member]].

In December 2013, [[BBC Newsnight]] reported that Lord Bhatia had been accused by the Ethnic Minority Foundation of misappropriating £600,000 from the charity. Lord Bhatia is suing the charity for unfair dismissal, and his lawyers say that these allegations are confusing the historical position with the present dispute.&lt;ref name=bbc-20131204&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25188606 |title=Lord Bhatia 'misappropriated 600,000 of charity funds' |author=Mark Daly |publisher=BBC |date=4 December 2013 |accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Andreas Maria Maximilian Freiherr von Mauchenheim genannt Bechtolsheim''' (born 30 September 1955&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diereichsten.de/index.php/alle-vorhandenen-beitraege/8-artikel-die-reichsten/13-andreas-maria-maximilian-freiherr-von-mauchenheim-vermoegen-und-biografie List of richest Germans] diereichsten.de; accessed 30 June 2017.{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a German electrical engineer, entrepreneur, investor, and self-made billionaire. He co-founded [[Sun Microsystems]] in 1982 and was its chief hardware designer. He later became an investor, most notable for providing Sergey Brin and Larry Page with their first round of funding, a $100,000 investment in 1998 before the two had even incorporated their company, [[Google]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/google#/entity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404135608/https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/google|date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His net worth reached $7 billion in September 2018.&lt;ref name=Forbes2013/&gt;

==Early life==
Bechtolsheim was born at [[Ammersee|Hängeberg am Ammersee, Bavaria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EhnTDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=H%C3%A4ngeberg+am+Ammersee&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qok9k7hDxT&amp;sig=Buku8z2O6Prz6f2tF3MCu7tNqKw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihiJKlvvHYAhXRvVMKHc9ED0QQ6AEIaDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=H%C3%A4ngeberg+am+Ammersee&amp;f=false|title=Deutschland digital: Unsere Antwort auf das Silicon Valley|first1=Marc|last1=Beise|first2=Ulrich|last2=Schäfer|date=11 August 2016|publisher=Campus Verlag|accessdate=24 January 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second of four children. The isolated house had no television or close neighbors, so he experimented with electronics as a child. His family moved to [[Rome]] in 1963. Five years later, in 1968, the family relocated again, to [[Nonnenhorn]] on [[Lake Constance]] in Germany. Aged 16, he designed an industrial controller for a nearby company based on the [[Intel 8080]] which he then programmed in [[binary code]] as he had no access to [[Assembly language|assemblers]]. Royalties from the product supported much of his education.&lt;ref name="oral"&gt;{{cite web|title=Andreas Bechtolsheim &amp; William Joy Oral History|work=Computerworld International Archives|author=Daniel S. Morrow|date=18 March 1999|url=http://www.cwheroes.org/archives/histories/BechtolsheimandJoy.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722143921/http://www.cwheroes.org/archives/histories/BechtolsheimandJoy.pdf|archivedate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an engineering student at [[Technical University of Munich]] Bechtolsheim entered the [[Jugend forscht]] contest for young researchers, and after entering for three years, won the physics prize in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Milliarden-Karriere: Andreas von Bechtolsheim - Bundessieger Physik 1974|year=2006|url=http://www.jugend-forscht.de/index.php/article/detail/723|accessdate=12 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719224302/https://www.jugend-forscht.de/index.php/article/detail/723|archivedate=19 July 2011}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received a [[Fulbright Award]] and moved to the USA in 1975 to attend [[Carnegie Mellon University]], where he received his master's degree in computer engineering in 1976. In 1977, he transferred to [[Stanford University]] and became a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] student in electrical engineering.&lt;ref name="oral"/&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Sun100U Cardcage.jpg|thumb|alt=printed circuit boards|Early Sun workstation hardware]]
At Stanford, Bechtolsheim designed  a powerful computer (called a [[workstation]]) with built-in networking called the [[SUN workstation]], a name derived from the initials for the [[Stanford University Network]]. It was inspired by the [[Xerox Alto]] computer developed at the [[PARC (company)|Xerox Palo Alto Research Center]]. Bechtolsheim was a "no fee consultant" at Xerox, meaning he was not remunerated directly but had free access to the research being done there. At the time, [[Lynn Conway]] was using workstations to design [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) circuits.&lt;ref name="oral"/&gt;

Bechtolsheim's advisor was Forest Baskett. In 1980, [[Vaughan Pratt]] also provided leadership to the SUN project. Support was provided by the Computer Science Department and [[DARPA]]. The modular computer was used for research projects such as developing the [[V (operating system)|V-System]], and for early [[Internet]] [[router (computing)|router]]s. Bechtolsheim tried to interest other companies in manufacturing the workstations, but only got lukewarm responses.&lt;ref name="oral"/&gt;

===Founding Sun===
One of the companies building computers for VLSI design was [[Daisy Systems]], where [[Vinod Khosla]] worked at the time. Khosla had graduated a couple of years earlier from the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]] with [[Scott McNealy]], who managed manufacturing at [[Onyx Systems]]. The three wrote a short business plan and quickly received funding from [[venture capital]]ists in 1982.&lt;ref name="oral"/&gt;
[[File:SPARCstation 1.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=small desktop computer|[[SPARCstation 1]], designed circa 1988]]
Bechtolsheim left Stanford to found the company, [[Sun Microsystems]], as employee number one. [[Bill Joy]], who was part of the team developing the [[BSD]] series of [[Unix]] operating systems, was the fourth member of the founding team. For a while Bechtolsheim and Joy shared an apartment in [[Palo Alto, California]].&lt;ref name="oral"/&gt;

The first product, the [[Sun-1]], included the Stanford [[CPU]] board design with improved memory expansion, and a sheet-metal case. By the end of the year, the experimental [[Ethernet]] interface designed by Bechtolsheim was replaced by a commercial board from [[3Com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sun Workstation product overview|year=1982|url=http://thenetworkisthecomputer.com/files/Sun1Overview001.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sun Microsystems had its [[Initial Public Offering]] in 1986 and reached $1 billion in sales by 1988. Bechtolsheim formed a project code-named UniSun around this time to design a small, inexpensive desktop computer for the educational market. The result was the [[SPARCstation 1]] (known as "campus"), the start of another line of Sun products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=High noon: the inside story of Scott McNealy and the rise of Sun Microsystems|page=88|author=Karen Southwick|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rQl4169IA4kC&amp;pg=PA88|isbn=978-0-471-29713-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other companies===
{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2017}}
In 1995, Bechtolsheim left Sun to found Granite Systems, a Gigabit Ethernet startup focused on developing high-speed [[network switches]]. In 1996, [[Cisco Systems]] acquired the firm for $220 million, with Bechtolsheim owning 60%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Journal of Business Strategy|author=Peter Cohan|title=Lessons from High-Tech Companies|date=November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became Vice President and general manager of Cisco's Gigabit Systems Business Unit, until leaving the company in December 2003 to head Kealia, Inc.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Bechtolsheim founded Kealia in early 2001 with Stanford Professor [[David Cheriton]], a partner in Granite Systems, to work on advanced server technologies using the [[Opteron]] processor from [[Advanced Micro Devices]]. In February 2004, Sun Microsystems announced it was acquiring Kealia in a stock swap. Due to the acquisition, Bechtolsheim returned to Sun again as senior vice president and chief architect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sun to buy Opteron server maker, reclaim co-founder|work= ZDNet|date=11 February 2004|author=Stephen Shankland|url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/sun-to-buy-opteron-server-maker-reclaim-co-founder/134275|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sun Acquires Server Technology Startup|work=eWeek|date=10 February 2004|author=Peter Galli|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/IT-Infrastructure/Sun-Acquires-Server-Technology-Startup|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kealia hardware technology was used in the [[Sun Fire X4500]] storage product.&lt;ref name="cloud"/&gt;

Along with Cheriton, in 2005 Bechtolsheim launched another high-speed networking company, Arastra. Arastra later changed its name to [[Arista Networks]]. Bechtolsheim left Sun Microsystems to become the Chairman and Chief Development Officer of Arista in October, 2008, but stated he still was associated with Sun in an advisory role.&lt;ref name="cloud"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sun Co-founder Bechtolsheim Joins Cloud Computing Startup|work=eWeek|date=23 October 2008|author=Chris Preimesberger|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Cloud-Computing/Sun-CoFounder-Bechtolsheim-Leaves-to-Join-Cloud-Computing-Startup|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investments===
Bechtolsheim co-founded HighBAR Ventures, an early-stage venture capital investment firm, along with two Sun colleagues: [[Bill Joy]] and Roy Sardiña. HighBAR's investments include [[Brocade]], [[Tasmania Network Systems]], [[Brightmail]], and Regroup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|work=HighBAR Ventures website|year=2009|url=http://www.highbarventures.com/about_us.asp|accessdate=13 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525122006/http://www.highbarventures.com/about_us.asp|archivedate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bechtolsheim and Cheriton were two of the first investors in [[Google]], investing [[US Dollar|US$]]100,000 each in September 1998. Bechtolsheim wrote the check to "Google Inc" prior to the company even being founded. Claims that Bechtolsheim coined the name "Google" is untrue. However, he did motivate the founders to officially organize the company under that name. When he gave the check to [[Lawrence E.

As a result of investments like these, Bechtolsheim was seen as one of the most successful "[[angel investor]]s",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/99/0JRL.html|work=Forbes|year=2006|title=Andreas von Bechtolsheim|accessdate=13 April 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522170847/http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/99/0JRL.html|archivedate=22 May 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in areas such as [[electronic design automation]] (EDA), which refers to the software used by people designing computer chips. He has made a number of successful investments in EDA. In one such EDA company, [[Magma Design Automation]], his stake was valued around $60 million.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Bechtolsheim invested in [[Tapulous]], the maker of music games for the [[Apple iPhone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Music Games for iPhone Give Artists New Spotlight |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/22/technology/start-ups/22tap.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|author= Jenna Wortham|date=21 December 2008|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tapulous was acquired by [[the Walt Disney Company]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disney Buys Tapulous, Maker of Video Games for IPads|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-07-01/disney-buys-tapulous-maker-of-video-games-for-ipads-update1-.html|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|author=Andy Fixmer and Adam Satariano|date=1 July 2010|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined George T.

Bechtolsheim invested in all of Haber's previous startups:{{citation needed|date= April 2011}} CompCore purchased by [[Zoran corporation|Zoran]], GigaPixel purchased by [[3Dfx]] and Mobilygen purchased by [[Maxim Integrated Products]] in 2008, as well as  [[Moovweb]], a cloud-based interface for mobile and computer websites in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bechtolsheim-Backed Moovweb Develops Mobile Sites And Smartphone Apps|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/04/bechtolsheim-backed-moovweb-develops-mobile-sites-and-smartphone-apps|date=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was reportedly an early investor in [[Claria Corporation]], which ceased operating in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Barbarians at the Digital Gate|newspaper=The New York Times|author= Timothy L. O'Brien and Saul Hansell|date=20 September 2004|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20040920monday.html|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Bechtolsheim invested in a [[Stanford University|Stanford]] incubated [[Semantic Web|semantic web]] startup [[Diffbot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/person/andy-bechtolsheim|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2013-09-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902134528/http://www.crunchbase.com/person/andy-bechtolsheim|archivedate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Never married, Bechtolsheim has not taken out United States citizenship. "I continue to be a German citizen, so I am not an American national. My legal name is the same it always was. The problem with the von is that in America they combine the von title with the last name and my last name is really so long that it actually didn't fit in most computers anymore. So my middle initial is now v. for von and the last name is of course as it always was. That's the peculiarity of the American way of looking at German names."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/von-bechtolsheim-i-invested-in-google-to-solve-my-own-problem/a-4557608|title=Von Bechtolsheim: I invested in Google to solve my own problem|website=Dw.com|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barbara Bush''' (née '''Pierce'''; June 8, 1925&amp;nbsp;– April 17, 2018) also known as the Bush Mother, was the [[First Lady of the United States]] from 1989 to 1993 as the wife of [[George H. W. Bush]], who served as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|41st]] [[President of the United States]], and founder of the [[Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy]]. She previously was [[Second Lady of the United States]] from 1981 to 1989. Among her six children are [[George W. Bush]], the 43rd President of the United States, and [[Jeb Bush]], the 43rd [[List of Governors of Florida|Governor of Florida]].

Barbara Pierce was born in [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing, New York]], on June 8, 1925.&lt;ref name="thirteen1"&gt;{{cite web |title=THIRTEEN |url=https://www.thirteen.org/metrofocus/2018/04/flushings-first-lady}}&lt;/ref&gt; She met George Herbert Walker Bush at the age of sixteen, and the two married in [[Rye, New York]], in 1945, while he was on leave during his deployment as a Naval officer in [[World War II]]. They moved to [[Texas]] in 1948, where George later began his political career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/24/washington/24immig.html|title= Texas Town, Now Divided, Forged Bush's Stand on Immigration|publisher=New York Times|date=June 24, 2007|accessdate= October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Barbara Pierce was born at the Booth Memorial Hospital on East 15th Street in Manhattan, New York, on June 8, 1925, to Pauline (née Robinson) and [[Marvin Pierce]]. She was raised in the suburban town of [[Rye, New York]].&lt;ref name="FL bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=42 |title=First Lady Biography: Barbara Bush |publisher=[[First Ladies National Historic Site|National First Ladies Library]] |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303162751/http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=42 |archivedate=March 3, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father later became president of McCall Corporation, the publisher of the popular women's magazines ''[[Redbook]]'' and ''[[McCall's]]''. She had two elder siblings, Martha and James, and a younger brother named Scott. Her ancestor Thomas Pierce Jr., an early [[New England]] colonist, was also an ancestor of [[Franklin Pierce]], 14th president of the United States. She was a fourth cousin, four times removed, of Franklin Pierce and [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.famouskin.com/famous-kin-menu.php?name=3102+barbara+bush|title= Famous Kin of Barbara (Pierce) Bush |publisher=FamousKin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierce and her three siblings were raised in a house on Onondaga Street in Rye. She attended Milton Public School from 1931 to 1937, [[Rye Country Day School]] until 1940&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.lohud.com/story/news/2018/04/17/barbara-bush-dies/526629002/ |title=Barbara Bush dies at age 92, grew up in Rye |publisher=Lohud.com |agency=Associated Press |date=April 18, 2018 |accessdate=April 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later the boarding school [[Ashley Hall (Charleston, South Carolina)|Ashley Hall]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], from 1940 to 1943.&lt;ref name="FL bio" /&gt; In her youth, Pierce was athletic and enjoyed swimming, tennis, and bike riding.&lt;ref name="FL bio" /&gt; Her interest in reading began early in life; she recalled gathering and reading with her family during the evenings.&lt;ref name="FL bio" /&gt;

==Marriage and family==
[[File:Entire Bush family.jpg|thumb|Barbara Bush, center, surrounded by her family, mid 1960s]]

When Pierce was 16 and on Christmas vacation, she met [[George H. W. Bush]] at a dance at the Round Hill Country Club in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2012/12/26/us/barbara-bush---fast-facts/index.html |title=Barbara Bush Fast Facts |publisher=CNN |date=April 17, 2018 |accessdate=April 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was a student at [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Bush, Barbara (1994), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; After 18 months, the two became engaged to be married, just before he went off to [[World War II]] as a [[United States Navy|Navy]] torpedo bomber pilot. He named three of his planes after her: ''Barbara,'' ''Barbara II'', and ''Barbara III''. When he returned on leave, she had discontinued her studies at [[Smith College]] in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]];&lt;ref name="FL bio" /&gt; two weeks later, on January 6, 1945, they were married at the First Presbyterian Church in Rye, New York,&lt;ref name="FL bio" /&gt; with the reception being held at [[The Apawamis Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lohud.com/story/opinion/editorials/2018/04/17/remembering-barbara-bush-rye/526731002/ |title=Barbara Bush, former First Lady, fondly remembered her Rye hometown |publisher=Lohud.com |date= |accessdate=April 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first eight months of their marriage, the Bushes moved around the Eastern United States, to places including [[Michigan]], [[Maryland]], and [[Virginia]], where George Bush's Navy squadron training required his presence.&lt;ref name="FL bio" /&gt;

Over the next 13 years, George and Barbara Bush had six children who, among them, gave the couple a total of 14 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren:

*[[George W. Bush|George Walker Bush]] (b. 1946), who married Laura Welch on November 5, 1977. They have twin daughters, and two granddaughters.
*[[Pauline Robinson Bush|Pauline Robinson "Robin" Bush]] (1949–1953), who died of [[leukemia]] at the age of three.
*[[Jeb Bush|John Ellis "Jeb" Bush Sr.]] (b. 1953), who married Columba Gallo on February 23, 1974. They have three children, and four grandchildren.
*[[Neil Bush|Neil Mallon Bush]] (b. 1955), who married Sharon Smith in 1980; they divorced in April 2003. They have three children, and one grandson. Neil married Maria Andrews in 2004.
*[[Marvin Bush|Marvin Pierce Bush]] (b. 1956), who married Margaret Molster in 1981. They have two children. 
*[[Dorothy Bush Koch|Dorothy Walker "Doro" Bush Koch]] (b. 1959), who married William LeBlond in 1982; they divorced in 1990, and have two children. Dorothy married [[Bobby Koch|Robert P. Koch]] in June 1992; they have two children.

==Texas years==
After the war ended, George and Barbara had their first child while George was a student at [[Yale University]]. The young family soon moved to [[Odessa, Texas]], where George entered the oil business. In September 1949, Barbara's parents were in a car accident in New York and her mother was killed. Mrs. Bush was pregnant at the time with her second child, and was advised not to travel to attend the funeral.  When the baby was born, she was named Pauline Robinson Bush in honor of Barbara's mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/barbara-bush-9232727|title=Barbara Bush|website=The Biography.com Website|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bushes moved to the Los Angeles area for a time, and then to [[Midland, Texas]] in 1950. The Bushes would move some 29 times during their marriage.&lt;ref name="FL bio" /&gt; Over time, Bush built a business in the oil industry and joined with colleagues to start up the successful [[HRG Group|Zapata Corporation]]. Barbara raised her children while her husband was usually away on business. In 1953, the Bushes' daughter, Robin, died of [[leukemia]].&lt;ref name="FL bio" /&gt;

When their daughter Dorothy was born in August 1959, the Bushes moved from Midland to Houston. In 1963, George Bush was elected [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]] Republican Party chairman, in the first of what would become many elections. In 1964, he made his first run for a prominent political office—[[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from Texas. Although he lost the election, the exposure that the Bush family received put George and Barbara on the national scene.&lt;ref name="FL bio" /&gt;

==Political life==
In 1966, George Bush was elected as a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] in Congress from Texas. Barbara raised her children while her husband campaigned and occasionally joined him on the trail. Over the ensuing years, George Bush was elected or appointed to several different positions in the U.S. Congress or the executive branch, or government-related posts, and Barbara Bush accompanied him in each case.

[[File:George and Barbara Bush in Houston, Texas on the night which George Bush was elected to Congress - NARA - 186373.tif|right|thumb|The Bushes celebrate in Houston on the evening in 1966 that George was elected a congressman.]]

As the wife of a Congressman, Barbara immersed herself in projects that piqued her interest; the projects included various charities and Republican women's groups in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="FL bio" /&gt; Though her husband lost a second bid for the Senate in 1970, President [[Richard Nixon]] appointed him the [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]], which enabled Barbara to begin forming relationships in [[New York City]] with prominent diplomats.&lt;ref name="FL bio" /&gt; As the [[Watergate scandal]] heated up in 1973, Nixon asked Bush to become Chairman of the [[Republican National Committee]]; Barbara advised her husband to reject the offer because of the harsh political climate,&lt;ref name="FL bio" /&gt; but he accepted anyway.

Nixon's successor, [[Gerald R. Ford]], appointed Bush [[United States Ambassador to China|head of the U.S. Liaison Office]] in the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1974, and the Bushes relocated. She enjoyed the time that she spent in China and often rode bicycles with her husband to explore cities and regions that few Americans had visited.&lt;ref name="FL bio" /&gt; Three years later, Bush was recalled to the U.S. to serve as [[Director of Central Intelligence]] during a crucial time of legal uncertainty for the agency. He was not allowed to share classified aspects of his job with Barbara; the ensuing sense of isolation, coupled with her perception that she was not achieving her goals while other women of her time were, plunged her into a depression.&lt;ref name="FL bio" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.philly.com/1990-05-22/news/25886573_1_barbara-bush-doggie-bag-volunteer-work |first=W. |last=Speers |title=Barbara Bush: I Overcame Depression |publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Network]] |date=May 22, 1990

Instead, she began delivering speeches and presentations about her time spent in the closed-off China, and volunteered at a [[hospice]].&lt;ref name="FL bio" /&gt;

Barbara Bush defended her husband's experience and personal qualities when he announced his candidacy for President of the United States in 1980. She caused a stir when she said that she supported ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] and was [[pro-choice]] on abortion,&lt;ref name="FL bio" /&gt; placing her at odds with the conservative wing of the Republican party, led by California Governor [[Ronald Reagan]]. Reagan earned the presidential nomination over her husband, who then accepted Reagan's invitation to be his running mate; the team was elected in 1980.

===Second Lady of the United States===
[[File:Thatchers and Bushes at Chequers.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Second Lady Barbara Bush and the Vice President with Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Denis Thatcher]] at [[Chequers]], 1984]]

Barbara Bush's eight years as [[Wife of the Vice President of the United States|Second Lady]] made her a household name. 
After her son Neil was diagnosed with [[dyslexia]], she took an interest in literacy issues and began working with several different literacy organizations. She spent much time researching and learning about the factors that contributed to illiteracy—she believed [[homelessness]] was also connected to illiteracy&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web |title=Barbara Bush Biography |access-date=December 23, 2011 |publisher=[[A&amp;E Television Networks]], LLC |url=http://www.biography.com/people/barbara-bush-9232727 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004022352/http://www.biography.com/people/barbara-bush-9232727 |archivedate=October 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and the efforts underway to combat both.&lt;ref name="FL bio" /&gt; She traveled around the country and the world, either with the vice president on official trips or by herself. In 1984, she wrote a children's book, ''[[C. Fred's Story]]'', which recounted the adventures of a family as related by their cocker spaniel, C. Fred. She donated all of the book's proceeds to literacy charities.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

By the mid-1980s, Bush was comfortable speaking in front of groups, and she routinely spoke to promote issues in which she believed. She became famous for expressing a sense of humor and self-deprecating wit.&lt;ref name="FL bio" /&gt; During the 1984 presidential campaign, Barbara made headlines when she told the press that she could not say on television what she thought of vice presidential candidate [[Geraldine Ferraro]], but "it rhymes with rich".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081015182134/http://www.bartleby.com/63/95/595.html Simpson's Contemporary Quotations, compiled by James B. Simpson. 1988.].

In 1988, Vice President Bush announced his candidacy for President to succeed the term-limited President Reagan. By this time, Barbara had experienced two presidential campaigns, but broke new ground by becoming the third candidate's spouse to speak at the national party convention that nominated her husband (after Eleanor Roosevelt in 1940 and Pat Nixon in 1972).&lt;ref name="FL bio" /&gt; She promised voters that she would be a traditional first lady and campaigned actively for her husband.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; The campaign at times focused on the large Bush family, and contrasted her with the First Lady, [[Nancy Reagan]], by highlighting her interest in domestic staples such as church, gardening, and time spent with family while placing less emphasis on style sense and fashion; she drew attention to both her famous white hair and disinterest in wearing designer clothes.&lt;ref name="FL bio" /&gt; She generally avoided discussion of political issues during the campaign, particularly those on which she and her husband differed, and those closely involved with the campaign have reported that she was actively involved in campaign strategy.&lt;ref name="FL bio" /&gt; Bush was elected in November 1988 and sworn in on January 20, 1989.

During the early 1980s, after statistics had shown that foreign-born immigrants from Latin America had nearly quintupled just since 1960, statistics showed that 35 million adults could not read above the eighth-grade level and that 23 million were not able to read beyond a fourth-grade level. Mrs. Bush appeared on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' to discuss the situation and spoke regularly on ''Mrs. Bush's Story Time'', a national radio program that stressed the importance of reading aloud to children.&lt;ref name="FL bio" /&gt; Her children Jeb Bush and Dorothy Bush Koch serve as co-chairs of the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy.

She was active in the [[White House Historical Association]] and worked to revitalize the White House Preservation Fund, which she renamed the [[White House Endowment Trust]]. The trust raises funds for the ongoing refurbishment and restoration of the [[White House]]. She met her goal of raising $25 million towards the endowment. The White House residence staff generally found Barbara Bush to be the friendliest and most easygoing of the First Ladies with whom they dealt.&lt;ref&gt;Brower, Kate Andersen (2015), pp. 46, 75, 117–122, 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbara Bush became the first U.S. First Lady to become a recipient of the [[Henry G. Freeman Jr. Pin Money Fund]], receiving $36,000, most of which she gave to favorite charities.

==== Personal life and interests ====
Bush was known for her affection for her pet [[English Springer Spaniel]] [[Millie (dog)|Millie]] and wrote a [[Millie's Book|children's book about Millie's new litter of puppies]]. She even included Millie in her official white house portrait, painted by [[Candace Whittemore Lovely]].&lt;ref&gt;"Arts &amp; Scholars". The Trident (Winter 2013): 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was struck every day by "how much things had changed" for her and her husband since they became President and First Lady. In place of a limousine, Bush tried to use a smaller car and travel by train and commercial aircraft for out-of-town trips. The heads of Bush's Secret Service detail were partially opposed to her wishes; the agents agreed to the small car but did not approve of the commercial air and train travel. At that time, the number of threats to the First Lady was higher than that of the vice president. Bush still wanted to use public transportation despite the opposition of the Secret Service. She was put-off by the fact that her flights would be delayed while agents checked out the planes and luggage. The plane on which Bush traveled was nicknamed "Bright Star," in honor of the leukemia foundation her husband and [[Hugh Liedtke]] founded after her daughter Robin died.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, Barbara (1994), pp. 264–265.&lt;/ref&gt;

During her husband's 1992 presidential campaign, Barbara Bush stated that [[abortion]] and [[homosexuality]] are personal matters and argued that the Republican Party should not take a stand on it, saying that "The personal things should be left out of, in my opinion, platforms and conventions." Her personal views on abortion were not known, although her friends reported at that time that she "privately supported [[abortion rights]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John M.|last=Broder|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920814&amp;slug=1507390|title=Barbara Bush Calls Abortion 'Personal Choice'|publisher=Seattle Times|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 14, 1992|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303162751/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920814&amp;slug=1507390|archivedate=March 3, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; She explained, "I hate abortions, but I just could not make that choice for someone else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/us-politics/8118079/George-W-Bush-became-opposed-to-abortion-when-mother-showed-him-dead-foetus-in-jar.html|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Toby|last=Harnden|authorlink=Toby Harnden|title=George W Bush became opposed to abortion when mother showed him dead foetus in jar|date=November 8, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303162751/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/us-politics/8118079/George-W-Bush-became-opposed-to-abortion-when-mother-showed-him-dead-foetus-in-jar.html|archivedate=March 3, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush was more popular than her immediate predecessor [[Nancy Reagan]] and successor [[Hillary Clinton]] because she carefully "avoided controversy" and took very few public positions on contentious issues.&lt;ref&gt;Killian, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-White House years===
After leaving the White House, she and her husband resided at the [[River Oaks, Houston|River Oaks community in Houston, Texas]], and at the [[Bush compound]] in [[Kennebunkport, Maine]]. Bush described January 20, 1993, the day of [[Bill Clinton]]'s inauguration, a "tough day" for her and her husband. After returning to Houston, the two were visited by their son, George W. Bush, and at that point, Bush realized that she had not cooked in 12 years. She had difficulty driving a car on her own, and she did not drive far from home for a long time; her husband warned people to get out of the way if they saw her car.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, Barbara (2004), pp. 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt; A month after her husband left office in February 1993, Bush was surprised when her husband booked them on the "Love Boat" ship ''[[Pacific Dawn (ship)|Regal Princess]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, Barbara (2004), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1993, Bush and her husband had breakfast with the former British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], who was on an American speaking tour. Thatcher mentioned the most recent celebration of former President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s birthday at the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library]] and Museum, where he orated the same card twice. Bush read about the incident after Reagan was diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]], which she called a "tragedy for both" the Reagans.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, Barbara (2004), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:US Navy 050318-O-4039N-002 President George W. Bush and his mother, Barbara Bush, wave goodbye to a crowd of over 200 Sailors and Marines aboard Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola, Fla.jpg|thumb|right|President George W. Bush and his mother Barbara prepare to board [[Air Force One]], 2005]]

Bush attempted to persuade her son George W. Bush not to run for [[Governor of Texas]] in the 1994 gubernatorial election. She was convinced that he could not defeat [[Ann Richards]], but he went on to win the election.&lt;ref&gt;Natfali, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Several days after he was sworn in as Governor of Texas, she went to a Distinguished Speakers Event at the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum|LBJ Library]] for [[Lady Bird Johnson]]. There, she was introduced by her son, the new Governor of Texas, and the following day, received a letter from him dated January 18, 1995, in which he asserted that he would not be governor had it not been for her and [[George H. W. Bush]]. Mrs. Bush described the letter as having "moved" both her and her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, Barbara. (2004), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bush, Barbara (2004), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 3, 1995, the Bushes went to [[Vietnam]]. This was "unbelievable" to Barbara because she "never expected to set foot in what had been [[North Vietnam]]. The Bushes first went to [[Hanoi]] and then to [[Ho Chi Minh City]]. They met with President [[Lê Đức Anh]] and party secretary [[Đỗ Mười]].&lt;ref&gt;Bush, Barbara (2004), pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 28, 1995, the Bushes drove to [[Portland, Maine]], for the announcement of the Barbara Bush Children's Hospital. Bush said her life was being stretched, adding, "Long after I am gone this hospital will be there with my name." The Bushes visited the children there, and Mrs. Bush started to recall her daughter Robin after seeing them. The Bushes returned home early that month.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, Barbara (2004), pp. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush campaigned for her son George W. Bush after he announced his presidential campaign in June 1999. Throughout the country, she met with women who supported his campaign, but she remained doubtful of his chances of winning. The resentment toward the campaign continued with her rejection any criticism of her son that was said in her presence. She refused to watch any of the debates, in contrast to her husband, who was willing to listen and watch every debate. This created friction between the couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=George H.

Several schools have been named for her: three [[primary school]]s and two [[middle school]]s in Texas and an elementary school in [[Mesa, Arizona]]. Also named for her is the Barbara Bush Library in [[Harris County, Texas]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090101115329/http://www.hcpl.lib.tx.us/branchinfo/cc/ccinfo.htm Barbara Bush Branch Library @ Cypress Creek]. hcpl.lib.tx.us&lt;/ref&gt; and the Barbara Bush Children's Hospital at [[Maine Medical Center]] in [[Portland, Maine]]. She served on the Boards of AmeriCares and the [[Mayo Clinic]], and headed the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy.

On March 18, 2003—two days before the beginning of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]—her son [[George W. Bush]] was President when [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Good Morning America]]'' asked her about her family's television viewing habits. She replied:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I watch none. He [former President George H. W. Bush] sits and listens and I read books, because I know perfectly well that, don't take offense, that 90 percent of what I hear on television is supposition, when we're talking about the news. And he's not, not as understanding of my pettiness about that. But why should we hear about body bags and deaths, and how many, what day it's gonna happen, and how many this or that or what do you suppose? Or, I mean, it's not relevant. So, why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that, and watch him suffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/barbara.asp|title=Barbara Bush 'Beautiful Mind' Quote|publisher=Snopes|access-date=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bush was visiting a Houston relief center for people displaced by [[Hurricane Katrina]] when she told the radio program ''[[Marketplace (radio program)|Marketplace]]'',
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Almost everyone I've talked to says, 'We're gonna move to Houston.' What I'm hearing, which is sort of scary, is they all want to stay in Texas... Everybody is so overwhelmed by the hospitality, and so many of the people in the arenas here, you know, were underprivileged anyway, so this (as she chuckles slightly) is working very well for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Image:Catherine Cranston.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The resolute Kate Cranston around 1903, dressed in the [[1850s in fashion|style of the 1850s]].]]
'''Catherine Cranston''' (27 May 1849 – 18 April 1934), widely known as '''Kate&amp;nbsp;Cranston''' or '''Miss&amp;nbsp;Cranston''', was a leading figure in the development of [[tea room]]s. She is nowadays chiefly remembered as a major patron of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] and [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald]], in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. The name of ''Miss Cranston's Tea Rooms'' lives on in reminiscences of Glasgow in its heyday.

==Background==
Her father, George Cranston, was a baker and pastry maker and, in 1849, the year of her birth, he became proprietor of the ''[[Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway]] Chop House and Commercial Lodgings'' at No. 39 George Square in Glasgow city centre.&lt;ref name="Glasgow Story"/&gt; The hotel was renamed the Royal Horse, then renamed again in May 1852 to become ''Cranston's Hotel and Dining Rooms'', offering: 
:"Convenient Coffee room and detached Smoking Rooms on Ground Floor, commodious Commercial Room and Parlour, comfortable Bed-rooms and Baths, &amp;c.  Coffee always ready. Cigars, wines, spirits, ales, Newspapers, Time-Tables, Writing Materials. ''Superior and varied Bill of Fare at the usual moderate charges.''&lt;ref name="Glasgow Story"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theglasgowstory.com/image.php?inum=TGSA01336&amp;t=2&amp;urltp=searchq.php%3Fqsearch%3Dcranston%26amp%3Bstart%3D0%26amp%3Bend%3D20%26amp%3Bft%3D36%26amp%3Bl%3Dy | title = Advertisement, Post Office Directory 1852-3 | publisher = The Glasgow Story | accessdate = 30 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Her slightly older brother Stuart (1848–1921) became a tea dealer and, according to ''Glasgow in 1901'', was "a pioneer of the business" there of "tea shops pure and simple" who by 1901 had three such tearooms offering nothing more substantial to eat than a sandwich. Kate went on to create much more of a social facility.&lt;ref name=G1901&gt;{{cite book | first= James Hamilton | last= Muir | authorlink= | author2= Muirhead Bone, James Bone and Archibald Hamilton Charteris, under the collective pen name of Muirhead Hamilton Bone | year= 1901 | title= Glasgow in 1901 | edition= facsimile reissue 2001 | publisher= William Hodge &amp; Co. of Glasgow, reissued by White Cockade Publishing | location= Oxford | isbn=1-873487-09-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other cities in the United Kingdom, Glasgow was then a centre of the [[temperance movement]] which sought an alternative to male-centred [[pub]]s. Tea had previously been a luxury for the rich, but from the 1830s it was promoted as an alternative to alcoholic drinks, and many new cafés and coffee houses were opened, catering more for ordinary people. However it was not until the 1880s that tea rooms and tea shops became popular and fashionable.&lt;ref name=Tea4you&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tea.co.uk/index.php?pgId=98 | title = Tea 4 You: A Social History | publisher = UK Tea Council | accessdate = 5 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miss Cranston's Tea Rooms==
[[Image:Miss Cranston's.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Poster design by Charles Rennie Mackintosh.]]
In 1878 Miss Kate Cranston opened her first tearoom, the Crown Luncheon Room, on [[Argyle Street, Glasgow]].&lt;ref name=glasgowmuseums&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.glasgowmuseums.com/showProject.cfm?venueid=0&amp;itemid=42 | title = Charles Rennie Mackintosh's Ingram Street Tearooms | publisher = Glasgow Museums – Projects | accessdate = 5 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; She set high standards of service, food quality and cleanliness, and her innovation lay in seeing the social need for something more than a restaurant or a simple "tea shop", and in putting equal attention into providing amenities designed in the latest style. Her first tearoom was decorated in a contemporary baronial style. On 16 September 1886 she opened her Ingram Street tearoom and in 1888 commissioned [[George Henry Walton|George Walton]] to decorate a new smoking room in the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts style]] in one of her tea rooms.&lt;ref name=arts&amp;crafts&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.achome.co.uk/biographies/biographies.htm | title = Arts &amp; Crafts Home | publisher = Mark Golding – Projects | accessdate = 6 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892 she became happily married to John Cochrane,&lt;ref name=famousscots&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rampantscotland.com/famous/blfamcranston.htm | title = Famous Scots – Kate Cranston (1850–1934) | publisher = rampantscotland | accessdate = 30 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but continued to trade under the name of ''Miss Cranston's Tearooms''. She opened new tearooms in Buchanan Street in 1897 (designed by [[George Washington Browne]]), expanded to take over the whole building in Argyle Street by 1898 (designed by [[H and D Barclay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=200086|title=Dictionary of Scottish Architects - DSA Architect Biography Report (August 6, 2018, 11:04 am)|first=David|last=Goold|date=|website=www.scottisharchitects.org.uk|accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), then completed her chain of four establishments with the [[Willow Tearooms]] (by [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]]) in [[Sauchiehall Street]], opened in 1903.&lt;ref name=glasgowmuseums/&gt;

While other cities offered very expensive and very basic tea rooms by 1901, Kate Cranston set the standard in Glasgow for more welcoming establishments. Rooms were provided for ladies only and for gentlemen only, as well as luncheon rooms where they could dine together and smoking rooms and billiards rooms for the gentlemen. ''Miss Cranston's Tea Rooms'' became social centres for all, for business men and apprentices, for ladies and ladies' maids. The ''Ladies Rooms'' were a particular success, newly allowing respectable women to get out and meet together without male company. Unlike cafes or tearooms in other cities, there was no intrusive supervision and those having tea had an assortment of [[Scone (bread)|Scone]]s and cakes to hand, with a discreet notice reminding newcomers to remember the amount consumed. At "the accounting", ''Glasgow in 1901'' reported, "One states the amount of ones indebtedness, and receives a check therefor from the attendant maiden. This, with the corresponding coin or coins, one hands in at the pay-desk, and so home. Nothing could be simpler or less irritating."&lt;ref name=G1901/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;{{cite book | first= | last= | authorlink= | year= 1991 | title= Charles Rennie Mackintosh | edition= Originally published: Richard Drew, 1987 | publisher= Chambers | location= Edinburgh | isbn=0-550-22540-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was a centre of artistic innovation at the time, and the tearooms served as art galleries for paintings by the "[[Glasgow School|Glasgow Boys]]". The architect Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]] visited the Buchanan Street tearoom in 1898, finding it "just a little outré", and wrote from there to his wife that "Miss Cranston is now Mrs. Cochrane, a dark, fat wee body with black sparkling luminous eyes, wears a bonnet garnished with roses, and has made a fortune by supplying cheap clean goods in surroundings prompted by the New Art Glasgow School."&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt;&lt;ref name=pocketguide&gt;{{cite book | first= John | last= McKean | authorlink= |author2=Colin Baxter | year= 1998 | title= Charles Rennie Mackintosh Pocket Guide | edition= | publisher= Colin Baxter Photography Ltd. | location= Grantown-on-Spey | isbn=1-900455-48-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tea rooms opened around the city, and in the late 1880s fine hotels elsewhere in Britain and in America began to offer tea service in tea rooms and tea courts.&lt;ref name=classiccafes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classiccafes.co.uk/History.html |title=Classic Cafes: An Intimate History |publisher=Adrian Maddox |accessdate=5 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323201633/http://www.classiccafes.co.uk/History.html |archivedate=23 March 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Glasgow in 1901'' reported that "Glasgow, in truth, is a very [[Tokyo|Tokio]] for tea-rooms. Nowhere can one have so much for so little, and nowhere are such places more popular and frequented." and that "It is not the accent of the people, nor the painted houses, nor yet the absence of [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] policemen that makes the Glasgow man in London feel that he is in a foreign town and far from home. It is a simpler matter. It is the lack of tea-shops."&lt;ref name=G1901/&gt; The original Sauchiehall Street tearoom building is presently being restored and is scheduled for reopening in 2018. It is planned to develop the adjacent building as a Mackintosh visitor centre. The 'Willow Tearooms' brand has been separated from the building and is now run privately at a location within a department store further along the street and at Buchanan Street adjacent to Miss Cranston's original premises. Both locations feature recreated Mackintosh furniture and interior features.

===Walton and Mackintosh===
[[Image:Mackintosh, BuchananTearooms Frieze.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Mackintosh's design for the frieze at the Buchanan Street tearoom.]]
[[George Henry Walton|George Walton]] set up ''George Walton &amp; Co, Ecclesiastical and House Decorators'' on the basis of his 1888 commission from Kate Cranston, and in 1896 was commissioned by her to design the interiors of new tearooms, designed and built by [[George Washington Browne]] of [[Edinburgh]], at 91–93 [[Buchanan Street]], which opened the following year.&lt;ref name=arts&amp;crafts/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theglasgowstory.com/image.php?inum=TGSE01207&amp;t=2&amp;urltp=searchq.php%3Fqsearch%3Dcranston%26amp%3Bstart%3D0%26amp%3Bend%3D20%26amp%3Bft%3D36%26amp%3Bl%3Dy | title = Coat tree by George Walton | publisher = The Glasgow Story | accessdate = 5 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was assisted in this by [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] who designed wall [[mural]]s in the form of [[stencil]]led [[frieze]]s depicting opposing pairs of elongated female figures surrounded by roses for the ladies' tearoom, the luncheon room and the smokers' gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.designmuseum.org/design/index.php?id=114 | title = Charles Rennie Mackintosh...Designer Information | publisher = The Design Museum | accessdate = 6 May 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060427233547/http://www.designmuseum.org/design/index.php?id=114 | archivedate = 27 April 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:"It is believed (and averred) that in no other town can you see in a place of refreshment such ingenious and beautiful decorations in the style of the new art as in Miss Cranston's shop in Buchanan Street. Indeed, so general in the city is this belief that it has caused the Glasgow man of the better sort to coin a new adjective denoting the height of beauty... 'It's quite Kate Cranston-ish !' "&lt;ref name= G1901/&gt;

Kate Cranston expanded her first tearoom to take over the whole building at 114 Argyle Street and commissioned Walton to design a new more modern interior, which opened in 1898. Walton's work included fireplaces, stencilled wall murals and stained glass panels for the doors. In the luncheon room the murals and door panels had a rose pattern theme. The furniture was designed by Mackintosh, introducing for the first time his characteristic high-backed chairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theglasgowstory.com/image.php?inum=TGSE01206&amp;t=2&amp;urltp=searchq.php%3Fqsearch%3Dcranston%26amp%3Bstart%3D0%26amp%3Bend%3D20%26amp%3Bft%3D36%26amp%3Bl%3Dy | title = Glass panel by George Walton | publisher = The Glasgow Story | accessdate = 5 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900 Kate Cranston gave Mackintosh the opportunity to redesign an entire room, at the Ingram Street tearoom. He had just recently married the artist [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald]], and together they created the White Dining Room, including a hallway opening onto the street and divided off by a wooden screen with [[Stained glass|leaded glass]] panels, giving those entering glimpses into the room itself. His fame was spreading, and in 1902 ''[[The Studio (magazine)|The Studio]]'' wrote of "Miss Cranston, whose tea-rooms, designed by Mr. Mackintosh, are reckoned by some of the pilgrims to Glasgow as one of the sights of the city."&lt;ref name=glasgowmuseums/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt;&lt;ref name=willowtearooms&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.willowtearooms.co.uk/mackintosh.htm | title = Mackintosh % Kate Cranston | publisher = The Willow Tearooms | accessdate = 5 May 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060414201559/http://www.willowtearooms.co.uk/mackintosh.htm | archivedate = 14 April 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Willow Tearooms===
{{main|Willow Tearooms}}
[[Image:Room de Luxe waitresses.jpg|thumb|left|Miss Cranston's waitresses, seen in the Room de Luxe of the Willow Tea Rooms.]]
Next Kate Cranston gave Mackintosh the major commission for an entire building in Sauchiehall Street, again in collaboration with his wife Margaret MacDonald on designs for the interiors. Behind a strikingly simple new façade this building provided three interlinked main tearooms at the ground floor and on a first floor gallery, with steps from that leading up a further half-storey to the famous "Room de Luxe" stretching the width of the building above the main entrance and front tearoom.

In a humorous review of the new tearoom for the [[Glasgow Evening News|Glasgow ''Evening News'']] titled ''Erchie in an Art Tea Room'', [[Neil Munro (Hugh Foulis)|Neil Munro]] described the "Room de Looks": 
::::::"The chairs is no like ony ither chairs ever I clapped eyes on, but ye could easy guess they were chairs, and a' roond the place there's a lump o' looking-gless wi' purple leeks pented on it every noo and then."&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt;

In 1905 ''[[Dekorative Kunst]]'' featured a special issue about the Willow Tea Rooms written by [[Hermann Muthesius]] who advised that "Today any visitor to Glasgow can rest body and soul in Miss Cranston's Tea Rooms and for a few pence drink tea, have breakfast and dream that he is in fairy land."&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt;

===Further projects===
[[Image:Cranston's exhibition cafe.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Menu design by [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald Mackintosh]].]]
Although the Willow Tearooms completed her chain, and remains the most famous of her tea rooms, Kate Cranston carried out several more projects, and Mackintosh provided increasingly innovative designs. In 1904 she commissioned him to carry out the redecoration and design of new furniture for the mansion of ''Hous'hill'' in [[Nitshill]] which was home to herself and her husband John Cochrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theglasgowstory.com/image.php?inum=TGSB00285&amp;t=2&amp;urltp=searchq.php%3Fqsearch%3Dcranston%26amp%3Bstart%3D0%26amp%3Bend%3D20%26amp%3Bft%3D36%26amp%3Bl%3Dy | title = Househill (Hous'hill) | publisher = The Glasgow Story | accessdate = 5 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theglasgowstory.com/image.php?inum=TGSE01088&amp;t=2&amp;urltp=searchq.php%3Fqsearch%3Dcranston%26amp%3Bstart%3D0%26amp%3Bend%3D20%26amp%3Bft%3D36%26amp%3Bl%3Dy | title = Furniture from Hous'hill | publisher = The Glasgow Story | accessdate = 5 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackintosh carried out further work on the Argyle Street tearoom in 1906 to design a basement conversion to form ''The Dutch kitchen''. He did further redesigns for rooms in the Ingram Street tearooms, creating the ''Cloister Room'' and the ''Chinese Room'' in 1911. The latter provides an exotic fantasy, with bright blue finished timber screens incorporating a cashier's kiosk, elaborate door lintels and dark blue finished furniture, all in Mackintosh's version of an oriental style.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

In the same year Kate Cranston provided temporary "Exhibition Cafes" at the ''Scottish International Exhibition'', apparently set up and designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, though nothing is now known of his scheme for this. The menu card designed by [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald Mackintosh]] shows the name for the tearooms, ''[[Cockade|The White Cockade]]'', but makes no visual connection with this reference to [[Jacobitism]]. It gives credit for supply of cakes to Miss Cranstons Bakery, 292 St Vincent St., Glasgow.&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theglasgowstory.com/image.php?inum=TGSA05208 | title = Kate Cranston | publisher = The Glasgow Story | accessdate = 5 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first= Nathaniel | last= Harris | authorlink= | year= 1996 | title= The Life and Works of Rennie Mackintosh | edition= | publisher= Parragon Book Service Ltd. | location= Avonmouth | isbn=0-7525-1445-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mackintosh, Willow Tearooms Interior Study, 1917.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Design for ''The Dug Out''.]]
In 1916 Kate opened ''Cranston's Cinema De Luxe'' in an entertainment complex designed for her by the architect [[James Miller (architect)|James Miller]], occupying the third floor of a six-storey building in Renfield Street, Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theglasgowstory.com/image.php?inum=TGSA00322 | title = Classic Cinema | publisher = The Glasgow Story | accessdate = 5 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917 Mackintosh carried out his last commission for Kate Cranston, and indeed one of his last architectural works to be constructed, with the design of an extension of the Willow Tea Rooms into the basement of the building next door to create ''The Dug Out'' in a style that anticipated [[Art Deco]].&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt;&lt;ref name=pocketguide/&gt;

Kate Cranston was greatly distressed when her husband died in 1917. She sold off her tea rooms and other businesses, and withdrew from public life. She had no children, and when she died in 1934 her will left two-thirds of her estate to the poor of Glasgow.&lt;ref name=famousscots/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Image:Room de Luxe2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Room de Luxe of the Willow Tearooms today.]]
Even though Kate Cranston had sold her tea rooms off, the name ''Miss Cranston's Tea Rooms'' long remained a byword for quality and for memories of Glasgow's heyday at the turn of the century. By 1938 tea rooms at 43 Argyll Arcade, 28 Buchanan Street, Renfield Street and Queen Street were being run by ''Cranston's Tea Rooms Ltd.'' They went into liquidation in 1954 and their premises were sold on for other uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/cranston.html | title = Records of Cranston's Tea Rooms Ltd, Glasgow, Scotland | publisher = Archives Hub | accessdate = 5 May 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120723010038/http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/cranston.html | archivedate = 23 July 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Willow Tearooms were renamed, then in 1928 they were sold on to Daly's department store who incorporated the premises into their shop, keeping the Room de Luxe in operation as the department store tea room.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

''Miss Cranston's Tearooms'' on Ingram Street continued in use as catering facilities from 1930 for ''Cooper's &amp; Co.'', then in 1950 the rooms came into the ownership of Glasgow City Council and were used for storage and a souvenir shop. In 1971 the furnishings were removed into storage when the building was demolished, and they are now the only original set of Mackintosh tearoom interiors to survive. Ownership was transferred to Glasgow Museums in 1978, and after a further period of storage restoration work began in 1993. The ''Ladies' Luncheon Room'' was exhibited three years later, and the ''Chinese Room'' and ''Cloister Room'' have since been restored. The Glasgow Museums website reports that they are "currently assessing what will be needed to research and preserve the Charles Rennie Mackintosh interiors of the Ingram Street Tearooms for future public display."&lt;ref name=glasgowmuseums/&gt; and prospective plans now exist to install at least some of the interiors at the new V&amp;A museum in Dundee.

[[Image:The Willow Tearooms Glasgow.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The restored Willow Tearooms building.]]
While Mackintosh's reputation was eclipsed by the 1920s, he was later recognised as a pioneer of [[modern architecture]], particularly in terms of the exterior of the Willow Tea Rooms. In the 1960s a resurgence of interest in [[Art Nouveau]] brought him international fame, and the furniture and designs he and his wife created for Kate Cranston are now extremely valuable.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

When Daly's closed, the Willow Tea Rooms were restored to an approximation of their original appearance. Catering reopened in the Room de Luxe, later extending to the recreated Tea Gallery, and was so successful that the business opened a new tearoom on the first floor of a building in Buchanan Street, near the original Buchanan Street and Ingram Street tearooms, fitted out with replicas of the White Dining Room and the Chinese Room from the Ingram Street tearoom. Confusingly, it trades under the name of ''The Willow Tea Rooms'', as this now appears to be more familiar to visitors than Miss Cranston's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.willowtearooms.co.uk/buchanan.htm | title = The Willow in Buchanan Street | publisher = The Willow Tearooms | accessdate = 5 May 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060414201720/http://www.willowtearooms.co.uk/buchanan.htm | archivedate = 14 April 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Commons category|Willow Tearooms}}
However, these new tearooms draw renewed attention to the contribution Kate's patronage made to Mackintosh's work, and the impact she had on the social life of Glasgow is still remembered in popular books such as ''Tea at Miss Cranston's''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first= Anna | last= Blair | authorlink= | year= 1985 | title= Tea at Miss Cranston's | edition= | publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn | location= London | isbn=0-85683-081-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The continuing interest in Miss Cranston is also reflected in the prices realised for items associated with her tearooms; for example ₤940 for six pieces of cutlery stamped Miss Cranston's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SIX PIECES OF CUTLERY designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh for Miss Cranston's Tearooms, circa 1905|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intObjectID=3908334|website=www.christies.com|publisher=Chirisite's|accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, it was announced that Cranston would feature on a design for [[The Royal Bank of Scotland £20 note]] to be circulated in 2020, the first woman other than [[Queen Elizabeth II]] to be depicted on a [[Banknotes of Scotland|banknote of that denomination in that country]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/17001564.glasgow-pioneer-kate-cranston-honoured-on-new-20-note/|title=Glasgow pioneer Kate Cranston honoured on new £20 note|work=[[Evening Times]]|author=Caroline Wilson|date=23 October 2018|accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (images of [[Nan Shepherd]] had been on a £5, [[Mary Somerville]] and [[Mary Slessor]] on a £10 and [[Elsie Inglis]] on a £50 in the past,&lt;ref name="Scotsman2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/new-rbs-bank-notes-to-feature-nan-shepherd-and-mary-somerville-1-4108245|title=New RBS bank notes to feature Nan Shepherd and Mary Somerville|date=25 April 2016|work=[[The Scotsman]]|accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while notes issued by English banks had already featured [[Elizabeth Fry]], [[Florence Nightingale]] and [[Jane Austen]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/bbc-journalist-mocked-for-saying-jane-austen-first-woman-on-bank-notes-a3634951.html|title='What about the Queen?': BBC journalist mocked for saying Jane Austen is first woman on bank notes |work=[[Evening Standard]]|author=Harriet Pavey|date=14 September 2017 |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''chain store''' or '''retail chain''' is a [[retail]] outlet in which several locations share a [[brand]], central management, and standardized business practices. They have come to dominate the retail and dining markets, and many service categories, in many parts of the world. A [[franchising|franchise]] retail establishment is one form of chain store.  In 2004, the world's largest retail chain, [[Walmart]], became the world's largest corporation based on gross sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/wal-mart-stores/|title=Wal-Mart Stores on the Forbes Global 2000 List|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-06-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==History==
{{primary|section|date=October 2017}}
In 1792, [[Henry Walton Smith]] and his wife Anna established [[W.H. Smith]] as a news vending business in London that would become a national concern in the mid-19th century under the management of their grandson [[William Henry Smith (1825–1891)|William Henry Smith]].&lt;ref name= HIS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whsmithplc.co.uk/about_whsmith/history_of_whsmith/|title=History of WHSmith - About WHSmith|website=www.whsmithplc.co.uk|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm took advantage of the [[History of rail transport in Great Britain#1830–1922: Early development|railway boom]] by opening news-stands at [[railway station|railway stations]] beginning in 1848.&lt;ref name= HIS/&gt; The firm, now called WHSmith, had more than 1,400 locations as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whsmithplc.co.uk/about_whsmith/our_stores/|title=Our stores - About WHSmith|website=www.whsmithplc.co.uk|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., chain stores began with the founding of [[The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company]] (A&amp;amp;P) in 1859. Initially the small chain sold [[tea]] and [[coffee]] in stores located in [[New York City]] and operated a national [[mail order]] business. The firm grew to 70 stores by 1878 when [[George Huntington Hartford]] turned A&amp;P into the country's first grocery chain. In 1900, it operated almost 200 stores.

Some cities had multiple stores, such as [[Bordeaux, France]].&lt;ref name="louisdewis.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Maison_Dewachter_Bordeaux,_France_Letterhead_1904.png|title=English: This is the letterhead for the Bordeaux location of Maison Dewachter, a chain of men's and boys' clothing stores in Belgium and France.|first=Maison Dewachter, Bordeaux|last=France|date=2 August 2018|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2018|via=Wikimedia Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dewachter.fr "Dewachter" stores were still operating in 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt; Louis Dewachter also became an internationally known landscape artist, painting under the pseudonym [[Louis Dewis]].

By the early 1920s, the U.S. boasted three national chains: A&amp;amp;P, [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth's]], and [[United Cigar Stores]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Chain Stores: Their Management and Operation |vauthors= Hayward WS, White P, Fleek HS, Mac Intyre H |publisher= McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=1922 |oclc=255149441 |chapter= The chain store field |pages=16–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, chain stores had come of age, and stopped increasing their total market share. Court decisions against the chains' price-cutting appeared as early as 1906, and laws against chain stores began in the 1920s, along with legal countermeasures by chain-store groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Chain Stores in America: 1859–1950 |author= Lebhar GM |location= New York |publisher= Chain Store Publishing Corp. |year=1952 |oclc=243136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
A chain store is characterised by the ownership or franchise relationship between the local business or outlet and a controlling business.

===Difference between a "chain" and formula retail===
While chains are typically "formula retail", a chain refers to ownership or franchise, whereas "formula retail" refers to the characteristics of the business.  There is considerable overlap because key characteristic of a formula retail business is that it is controlled as a part of a business relationship, and is generally part of a chain. Nevertheless, most codified municipal regulation relies on definitions of formula retail (e.g., [[Formula restaurant|formula restaurants]]),&lt;ref name="jaffrey_NH"&gt;[http://www.townofjaffrey.com/sites/jaffreynh/files/pages/summary_of_proposed_zoning_changes.pdf Town of Jaffrey Planning Board Proposed Zoning Changes Summary], Public Hearing January 22, 2018, Town of Jaffrey, New Hampshire (.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sf_use"&gt;[http://sf-planning.org/chain-stores-formula-retail-use Permit how-to guides - chain stores (formula retail use)], Planning Dept., City and Cty. of San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="porttownsend"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codepublishing.com/WA/PortTownsend/html/PortTownsend17/PortTownsend1754.html|title=Chapter 17.54 FORMULA RETAIL AND RESTAURANT ESTABLISHMENTS|website=www.codepublishing.com|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part because a restriction directed to "chains" may be deemed an impermissible restriction on [[Commerce Clause|interstate commerce]] (in the US), or as exceeding municipal zoning authority (i.e., regulating "who owns it" rather than the characteristics of the business).&lt;ref name="park_v_malibu"&gt;[https://cases.justia.com/california/court-of-appeal/2017-b271620.pdf?ts=1498075335 The Park at Cross Creek v.

A '''restaurant chain''' is a set of related [[restaurant]]s in many different locations that are either under shared corporate ownership (e.g., [[McDonald's]] in the U.S.) or [[franchising]] agreements.&lt;ref name="Jakle Sculle 2002"&gt;{{cite book | last=Jakle | first=J.A. | last2=Sculle | first2=K.A. | title=Fast Food: Roadside Restaurants in the Automobile Age | publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press | series=The road and American culture | year=2002 | isbn=978-0-8018-6920-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nYcgnWKWXgC&amp;pg=PA68 | access-date=December 29, 2017 | page=68–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the restaurants within a chain are built to a [[Formula restaurant|standard format]] through architectural prototype development and offer a standard menu and/or services.&lt;ref name="jaffrey_NH" /&gt;

[[Fast food restaurant]]s are the most common, but sit-down restaurant chains (such as [[Timber Lodge Steakhouse]], [[Buffalo Wild Wings]], [[Outback Steakhouse]], [[T.G.I. Friday's]], [[Legal Sea Foods]], [[Ruby Tuesday (restaurant)|Ruby Tuesday]] and [[Olive Garden]]) also exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.fr/us/the-20-best-chain-restaurants-in-america-2016-7/#16-buffalo-wild-wings-5|title=The 20 best chain restaurants in America|website=Business Insider France|language=fr-FR|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restaurant chains are often found near [[highway]]s, [[shopping mall]]s and [[tourist attraction|tourist areas]].

==Opposition==
{{unsourced|section|date=October 2017}}
The displacement of [[independent business]]es by chains has sparked increased collaboration among independent businesses and communities to prevent chain proliferation. These efforts include community-based organizing through [[Independent Business Alliance]]s (in the U.S. and Canada) and "buy local" campaigns. In the U.S., [[Trading company|trade]] organizations such as the [[American Booksellers Association]] and American Specialty Toy Retailers do national promotion and advocacy. [[NGOs]] like the [[New Rules Project]] and [[New Economics Foundation]] provide research and tools for pro-independent business education and policy while the [[American Independent Business Alliance]] provides direct assistance for community-level organizing.

==Regulation and exclusion==
A variety of towns and cities in the United States whose residents wish to retain their distinctive character—such as [[San Francisco]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Compromise-reached-on-San-Francisco-s-chain-5870444.php|title=Compromise reached on San Francisco’s chain store limits|date=5 November 2014|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]] and other [[Cape Cod]] villages; [[Bristol, RI]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-07-20-chain-stores_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - Cities put shackles on chain stores|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[McCall, Idaho]]; [[Port Townsend, Washington]]; [[Ogunquit, Maine]]; [[Windermere, Florida]] and [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California]]—closely regulate, even exclude, chain stores. They don't exclude the chain itself, only the standardized formula the chain uses, described as "''formula businesses''"&lt;ref name="malibu"&gt;[https://www.malibucity.org/DocumentCenter/View/4882/PC130729_Item-6D_Correspondence_DWaite2 Analysis of Cities with Formula Business Ordinances], Malibu, California (.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, there could often be a restaurant owned by [[McDonald's]] that sells hamburgers, but not the formula franchise operation with the golden arches and standardized menu, uniforms, and procedures. The reason these towns regulate chain stores is aesthetics and tourism.&lt;ref name="malibu" /&gt;  Proponents of formula restaurants and formula retail allege the restrictions are used to protect independent businesses from competition.&lt;ref name="ILSR"&gt;[https://ilsr.org/rule/formula-business-restrictions/ Formula Business Restrictions], Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/09/realestate/commercial/09chain.html "Cape Cod Residents Keep the Chain Stores Out"] article by Beth Greenfield June 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Committee on Data for Science and Technology''' ('''CODATA''') was established in 1966 as an interdisciplinary committee of the [[International Council for Science]]. It seeks to improve the compilation, critical evaluation, storage, and retrieval of data of importance to [[science]] and [[technology]].

CODATA sponsors the CODATA international conference&lt;ref name="Conference"/&gt; every two years.

&lt;!-- redirect anchors for CODATA version numbers can be found immediately above this section header --&gt;
CODATA is best known for (and sometimes confused with) its Task Group on Fundamental Constants (TGFC).  Established in 1969, its purpose is to periodically provide the international scientific and technological communities with an internationally accepted set of values of the [[dimensionless physical constant|fundamental physical constant]]s and closely related [[conversion factor]]s for use worldwide.

The first such CODATA set was published in 1973.&lt;ref name="CODATA1973"/&gt;  Later versions are named based on the year of the data incorporated; the 1986 CODATA (published April 1987) used data up to 1 January 1986.&lt;ref name="CODATA1986"/&gt;  All subsequent releases use data up to the ''end'' of the stated year, and are necessarily published a year or two later: 1998 (April 2000),&lt;ref name="CODATA1998"/&gt; 2002 (January 2005),&lt;ref name="CODATA2002"/&gt; 2006 (June 2008)&lt;ref name="CODATA2006"/&gt; and the sixth in 2010 (November 2012).&lt;ref name="CODATA2010"/&gt; The latest version is Version 7.0 called "2014 CODATA" published on 25 June 2015.&lt;ref name="CODATA2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CODATA2014Full"/&gt;

The CODATA recommended values of fundamental physical constants are published at the NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty.&lt;ref name="NISTCUU"/&gt;

=== {{anchor|2017|2018}}Schedule ===
Since 1998, the task group has produced a new version every four years, incorporating results published up to the end of the specified year.

In order to support the upcoming [[Redefinition of SI base units|redefinition of the SI base units]],&lt;ref name="Minutes2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CODATA2014Full"/&gt; adopted at the 26th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] on 16 November 2018, CODATA made a special release that was published in October 2017.&lt;ref name="CODATATaskGroup"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The next regular version, with a closing date of 31 December 2018,&lt;ref name="NISTCUU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CODATATaskGroup"/&gt; will be used to produce the new 2018 CODATA values that will be made available by the time the revised SI come into force on 20 May 2019. This is necessary because the redefinitions have a significant (mostly beneficial) effect on the uncertainties and correlation coefficients reported by CODATA.

{{merge from|Corporate Governance of ICT|discuss=Talk:Corporate governance of information technology#Proposed merge with Corporate Governance of ICT|date=May 2018}}
'''Information and technology''' ('''IT''') '''governance''' is a subset discipline of [[corporate governance]], focused on information and technology (IT) and its [[performance management|performance]] and [[IT risk management|risk management]]. The interest in IT governance is due to the ongoing need within organizations to focus value creation efforts on an organization's strategic objectives and to better manage the performance of those responsible for creating this value in the best interest of all stakeholders. It has evolved from [[The Principles of Scientific Management]], [[Total Quality Management]] and ISO 9001 [[Quality management system]].

Historically, board-level executives deferred key IT decisions to the company's IT management and business leaders. Short-term goals of those responsible for managing IT can be in conflict with the best interests of other stakeholders unless proper oversight is established.  IT governance systematically involves everyone: board members, executive management, staff, customers, communities, investors and regulators.  An IT Governance framework is used to identify, establish and link the mechanisms to oversee the use of information and related technology to create value and manage the risks associated with using information and technology.

Various definitions of IT governance exist. While in the business world the focus has been on managing performance and creating value, in the academic world the focus has been on "specifying the decision rights and an accountability framework to encourage desirable behavior in the use of IT."&lt;ref&gt;
Weill, P. &amp; Ross, J. W., 2004, ''IT Governance: How Top Performers Manage IT Decision Rights for Superior Results''", Harvard Business School Press, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IT Governance Institute's definition is: "... leadership, organizational structures and processes to ensure that the organisation's IT sustains and extends the organisation's strategies and objectives."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |publisher=IT Governance Institute |year=2003 |title=Board Briefing on IT Governance, 2nd Edition |accessdate=June 24, 2014 |url=
http://www.isaca.org/restricted/Documents/26904_Board_Briefing_final.pdf |format= PDF}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[AS8015]], the Australian Standard for Corporate Governance of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), defines [[Corporate Governance of ICT]] as "The system by which the current and future use of ICT is directed and controlled. It involves evaluating and directing the plans for the use of ICT to support the organisation and monitoring this use to achieve plans. It includes the strategy and policies for using ICT within an organisation."

==Background==
The discipline of information technology [[governance]] first emerged in 1993 as a derivative of corporate governance and deals primarily with the connection between an organisation's strategic objectives, business goals and [[IT management]] within an [[organization]]. It highlights the importance of value creation and accountability for the use of information and related technology and establishes the responsibility of the governing body, rather than the [[chief information officer]] or business management.
&lt;!-- rejigged the para above, very slightly - concerned about confusion between governance and portfolio/programme management --&gt;

The primary goals for information and technology (IT) governance are to (1) assure that the use of information and technology  generate [[business value]], (2) oversee management's performance and (3) mitigate the risks associated with using information and technology. This can be done through board-level direction, implementing an [[organizational structure]] with well-defined accountability for decisions that impact on the successful achievement of strategic objectives and institutionalize good practices through organizing activities in processes with clearly defined process outcomes that can be linked to the organisation's strategic objectives.

Following corporate governance failures in the 1980s, a number of countries established codes of corporate governance in the early 1990s:
* Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (USA)
* Cadbury Report (UK)
* King Report (South Africa).

As a result of these corporate governance efforts to better govern the leverage of corporate resources, specific attention was given to the role of information and the underpinning technology to support good corporate governance. It was soon recognized that information technology was not only an enabler of corporate governance, but as a resource, it was also a value creator that was in need of better governance.

In Australia, the AS8015 Corporate Governance of ICT was published in January 2005. It was fast-track adopted as [[ISO/IEC 38500]] in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsmf.nl/imagesfile/PRESENTATIES%20JC%2008%20tbv%20publicatie/Christophe%20Feltus%20Introduction%20to%20ISO%2038500%20v1_0.pdf Introduction to ISO 38500] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IT governance process enforces a direct link of IT resources &amp; process to enterprise goals in line of strategy. There is a strong correlation between maturity curve of IT governance and overall effectiveness of IT.

==Problems==
IT governance is often confused with [[IT management]], [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] and [[Information technology controls|IT controls]]. The problem is increased by terms such as "governance, risk and compliance (GRC)" that establish a link between governance and compliance. The primary focus of IT governance is the stewardship of IT resources on behalf of various [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] whose ranking is established by the organisation's governing body. A simple way to explain IT governance is: ''what'' is to be achieved from the leveraging of IT resources. While IT management is about "planning, organizing, directing and controlling the use of IT resources" (that is, the ''how''), IT governance is about creating value for the stakeholders based on the direction given by those who govern. [[ISO 38500]] has helped clarify IT governance by describing a model to be used by company directors.

While directors are responsible for this stewardship it is not unusual that will delegate this responsibility to management (business and IT) who are expected to develop the necessary capability to deliver the performance expected. Whilst managing risk and ensuring compliance are essential components of [[good governance]], the  primary focus is on delivering value and managing performance (i.e. "Governance, Value delivery and Performance management" (GVP)).

==Frameworks==
There are quite a few supporting references that may be useful guides to the implementation of information and technology (IT) governance. Some of them are:
* [[AS 8015|AS8015-2005]] Australian Standard for Corporate Governance of Information and Communication Technology. AS8015 was adopted as ISO/IEC 38500 in May 2008
* [[ISO/IEC 38500|ISO/IEC 38500:2015]] Corporate governance of information technology,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/pressrelease.htm?refid=Ref1135 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205091528/http://www.iso.org/iso/pressrelease.htm?refid=Ref1135 |date=December 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (very closely based on AS8015-2005) provides a framework for effective governance of IT to assist those at the highest level of organizations to understand and fulfill their legal, regulatory, and ethical obligations in respect of their organizations’ use of IT. ISO/IEC 38500 is applicable to organizations from all sizes, including public and private companies, government entities, and not-for-profit organizations. This standard provides guiding principles for directors of organizations on the effective, efficient, and acceptable use of Information Technology (IT) within their organizations.
* [[COBIT5]] is regarded as the world's leading IT governance and control framework. COBIT5 provides a reference model of 37 [[IT processes]] typically found in an organization. Each process is defined together with process inputs and outputs, key process activities, process objectives, performance measures and a maturity model. [[ISACA]] published COBIT5 in April 2012 as a "business framework for the governance and management of enterprise IT". COBIT5 consolidates COBIT4.1, Val IT and Risk IT into a single framework acting as an enterprise framework aligned and interoperable with TOGAF and ITIL.
*IGPMM- The Information Governance Process Maturity Model &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7FFuDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT38&amp;lpg=PT38&amp;dq=cgoc+igpmm&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qEructlwzq&amp;sig=6_XfQ12z6NxQFdFHizxxRFzsK2s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiTlpir68jdAhUICnwKHXhIBUUQ6AEwCXoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=cgoc%20igpmm&amp;f=false|title=Information Governance for Healthcare Professionals: A Practical Approach|last=Smallwood|first=Robert F.|date=2018-10-01|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781351339728|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; depends on maturing 22 processes that help identify – and improve the management of – information value, cost and risk. CGOC updated the IGPMM in March 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.corporatecomplianceinsights.com/new-igpmm-essential-in-confronting-data-challenges/|title=New IGPMM Essential in Confronting Data Challenges - Corporate Compliance Insights|date=2017-03-03|work=Corporate Compliance Insights|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The processes reflect the needs of the key information stakeholders, including legal, records information management (RIM), privacy and security, lines of business and IT. The maturation for each business process moves through four stages:
** Stage 1: Ad hoc and inconsistent
** Stage 2: Siloed and manual
** Stage 3: Siloed, consistent and instrumented
** Stage 4: Integrated, instrumented and optimized

Other frameworks offer a partial view on IT Management &amp; IT Governance Processes:
* [[Capability Maturity Model|CMM]] - The Capability Maturity Model: focus on software engineering
* [[ITIL]] - The IT Infrastructure Library focus on IT Service management
* [[ISO/IEC 20000]] - Focus on IT Service management
* [[ISO/IEC 27001]] - Focus on Information Risk Management
* [[ISO/IEC 29148]] and [[IREB]] - Focus on Requirement Engineering
* [[ISO/IEC 29119]] and [[ISTQB]] - Focus on Software Testing

Non-IT specific frameworks of use include:
* [[Prince2]] and [[PMBoK]] - Focus on Project Management
* [[ISO 22301]] - Focus on Business Continuity
* The [[Balanced Scorecard]] (BSC) - method to assess an organization’s performance in many different areas
* [[Six Sigma]] - Focus on quality assurance
* [[The Open Group Architecture Framework]] (TOGAF) - methodology to align business and IT, resulting in useful projects and effective governance

==Professional certification==
* Certified in the Governance of Enterprise Information Technology ([[CGEIT]]) is a certification created in 2007 by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association ([[ISACA]]). It is designed for experienced professionals, who can demonstrate 5 or more years experience, serving in a managing or advisory role focused on the governance and control of IT at an enterprise level. It also requires passing a 4-hour test, designed to evaluate an applicant's understanding of enterprise IT management. The first examination was held in December 2008.
* COBIT5 Foundation, COBIT5 Assessor and COBIT5 Implementation are certifications created in 2012 by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association ([[ISACA]]).

{{Short description|Dishonest or fraudulent conduct by those in power}}
:''Individual nation articles should be consulted on specific national responses to corruption.''

In general, '''corruption''' is a form of [[dishonesty]] or criminal activity undertaken by a person or organization entrusted with a position of authority, often to acquire illicit benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Corruption can be illegal (or legal in a [[kleptocracy]]){{dubious|date=July 2018}} and dishonest, but in recent years can also can involve legal miss-conduct in many other countries and can have global reach in many cases. See [http://thelawdictionary.org/corruption/ Black's Law Dictionary] for legal definition. See also: [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/Legal_Corruption.pdf worldbank.org] paper noting that corruption "may involve collusion between parties typically both from the public and private sectors, and may be legal in many countries"&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption may include many activities including [[bribery]] and [[embezzlement]], though it may also involve practices that are legal in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/Legal_Corruption.pdf |title=Report|website=siteresources.worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Political corruption]] occurs when an office-holder or other governmental employee acts in an official capacity for personal gain. Corruption is most  commonplace in [[kleptocracies]], [[oligarchies]], [[narco-state]]s and [[mafia]] states.

Corruption can occur on different scales. Corruption ranges from small favors between a small number of people (petty corruption),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elliott|first=Kimberly Ann|date=1997|title=Corruption as an international policy problem: overview and recommendations|url=https://piie.com/publications/chapters_preview/12/10ie2334.pdf|journal=Washington, DC: Institute for International Economics|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to corruption that affects the government on a large scale (grand corruption), and corruption that is so prevalent that it is part of the everyday structure of society, including corruption as one of the symptoms of organized crime. Corruption and crime are endemic sociological occurrences which appear with regular frequency in virtually all countries on a global scale in varying degree and proportion. Individual nations each allocate domestic resources for the control and regulation of corruption and crime. Strategies to counter corruption are often summarized under the umbrella term [[anti-corruption]].

==Scales of corruption==
[[File:Say no to bribes in Chipata, Zambia.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A [[billboard]] in [[Zambia]] exhorting the public to "Just say no to corruption".]]
[[File:Niger, Niamey, anti-corruption billboard.jpg|thumb|300px|right|An anti-corruption billboard at the entry into [[Niamey]], capital of [[Niger]]. The text, translated from French, reads: "Together, let's fight against corruption at the borders", and "With my identity card or my passport plus my vaccinaton certificate, I can travel in all tranquillity within the realm of [[Economic Community of West African States|ECOWAS]]".]]

Stephen D. Morris,&lt;ref&gt;Morris, S.D. (1991), Corruption and Politics in Contemporary Mexico. University of Alabama Press, Tuscaloosa&lt;/ref&gt; a professor of politics, writes that [[Politics|politic]]al corruption is the illegitimate use of public power to benefit a private interest. Economist Ian Senior&lt;ref&gt;Senior, I. (2006), Corruption – The World’s Big C., Institute of Economic Affairs, London&lt;/ref&gt; defines corruption as an action to (a) secretly provide (b) a good or a service to a third party (c) so that he or she can influence certain actions which (d) benefit the corrupt, a third party, or both (e) in which the corrupt agent has authority. [[Daniel Kaufmann (economist)|Daniel Kaufmann]],&lt;ref name="Legal Corruption"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/Legal_Corruption.pdf|title=Legal Corruption|last2=Vicente|first2=Pedro|year=2005|publisher=World Bank|format=PDF|last1=Kaufmann|first1=Daniel|author-link1=Daniel Kaufmann (economist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the World Bank, extends the concept to include 'legal corruption' in which power is abused within the confines of the law—as those with power often have the ability to make laws for their protection. The effect of corruption in infrastructure is to increase costs and construction time, lower the quality and decrease the benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Locatelli|first=Giorgio|last2=Mariani|first2=Giacomo|last3=Sainati|first3=Tristano|last4=Greco|first4=Marco|date=2017-04-01|title=Corruption in public projects and megaprojects: There is an elephant in the room!|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263786316301090|journal=International Journal of Project Management|volume=35|issue=3|pages=252–268|doi=10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly, a number of indicators and tools have been developed which can measure different forms of corruption with increasing accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/113281515516828746/pdf/WPS8299.pdf|title=Can We Measure the Power of the Grabbing Hand?

===Petty corruption===
'''Petty corruption''' occurs at a smaller scale and takes place at the implementation end of public services when public officials meet the public. For example, in many small places such as registration offices, police stations, state licensing boards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mishler v. State Bd. of Med. Examiners|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/nevada/supreme-court/1993/22397-1.html|website=Justia Law|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-534_19m2.pdf|title=Report|website=supremecourt.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many other private and government sectors.

===Grand corruption===
'''Grand corruption''' is defined as corruption occurring at the highest levels of government in a way that requires significant subversion of the political, legal and economic systems. Such corruption is commonly found in countries with authoritarian or dictatorial governments but also in those without adequate policing of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/documents/NGO/Grand_Corruption_definition_with_explanation_19_August_2016_002_1.pdf|title=Material on Grand corruption|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government system in many countries is divided into the legislative, [[Executive (government)|executive]] and judiciary branches in an attempt to provide independent services that are less subject to grand corruption due to their independence from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.projects.iq.harvard.edu/gov2126/files/altlassen.pdf|title=Political And Judicial Checks On Corruption: Evidence From American State Governments|last=Alt|first=James|date=|website=Projects at Harvard|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203043655/http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/gov2126/files/altlassen.pdf|archive-date=2015-12-03|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systemic corruption===
'''Systemic corruption''' (or endemic corruption)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u4.no/glossary/|title=Glossary|publisher=U4 Anti-Corruption Resource Centre|accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is corruption which is primarily due to the weaknesses of an organization or process. It can be contrasted with individual officials or agents who act corruptly within the system.

Factors which encourage systemic corruption include [[conflict of interest|conflicting incentives]], [[discretion|discretionary powers]]; [[monopoly|monopolistic powers]]; lack of [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]]; low pay; and a culture of [[impunity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Diagnosis corruption| pages=135–136 |author=Lorena Alcazar, Raul Andrade |year=2001 |isbn=978-1-931003-11-7 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Some scholars argue that there is a negative duty{{clarify|reason=change wording. Does this mean Western governments should NOT protect... in order that the undeveloped country develop its own? Or that it should stop corruption?|date=February 2015}} of western governments to protect against systematic corruption of underdeveloped governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Merle|editor1-first=Jean-Christophe|title=Global Challenges to Liberal Democracy|journal=Spheres of Global Justice|date=2013|volume=1|page=812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pogge|first1=Thomas|title=Severe Poverty as a Violation of Negative Duties|url=http://thomaspogge.com/publications-on-global-justice/|website=thomaspogge.com|accessdate=8 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211060650/http://thomaspogge.com/publications-on-global-justice/|archive-date=11 February 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption in different sectors==
Corruption can occur in any sector, whether they be public or private industry or even [[NGOs]] (especially in public sector). However, only in democratically controlled institutions is there an interest of the public (owner) to develop internal mechanisms to fight active or passive corruption, whereas in private industry as well as in NGOs there is no public control. Therefore, the owners' investors' or sponsors' profits are largely decisive.

===Government/public sector===
{{anchor|Government/Public corruption}}

Public corruption includes corruption of the political process and of government agencies such as the police as well as corruption in processes of allocating public funds for contracts, grants, and hiring. Recent research by the World Bank suggests that who makes policy decisions (elected officials or bureaucrats) can be critical in determining the level of corruption because of the incentives different policy-makers face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Alexander|year=2013|title=Small is beautiful, at least in high-income democracies: the distribution of policy-making responsibility, electoral accountability, and incentives for rent extraction  |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2013/01/07/000158349_20130107132037/Rendered/PDF/wps6305.pdf|format=PDF|website= World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political corruption is the abuse of public power, office, or resources by elected government officials for personal gain, by extortion, soliciting or offering bribes. It can also take the form of office holders maintaining themselves in office by purchasing votes by enacting laws which use taxpayers' money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/pubs/article/article.asp |title=SOS, Missouri – State Archives Publications |publisher=Sos.mo.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests that corruption can have political consequences- with citizens being asked for bribes becoming less likely to identify with their country or region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/21-14.pdf |format=PDF|last1=Hamilton|first1=A.|last2=Hudson|first2=J.|year=2014|title=Bribery and Identity: Evidence from Sudan|website= Bath Economic Research Papers, No 21/14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political act of '''Graft''' (American English), is a well known and now global form of political corruption, being the unscrupulous and illegal use of a politician's authority for personal gain, when funds intended for public projects are intentionally misdirected in order to maximize the benefits to illegally private interests of the corrupted individual(s) and their cronies.

[[File:"Golden toilet" in ((Kaunas)), ((Lithuania)).png|thumb|250px|right|The Kaunas "golden toilet".]]

The '''[[Corruption in Lithuania#Kaunas golden toilet case|Kaunas golden toilet case]]''' was a major Lithuanian scandal. In 2009, municipality of Kaunas (led by mayor [[Andrius Kupčinskas]]) ordered that a shipping container was to be converted into an outdoor toilet at a cost of 500'000 [[litas]] (around 150'000 euros). It was to also require 5'000 LTL (1'500 EUR) in monthly maintenance costs.&lt;ref name="archive.org5"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/auksinis-tualetas-per-menesi-atsieis-5-tukst-lt.d?id=59903123|title="Auksinis" tualetas per mėnesį atsieis 5 tūkst.

Despite the investment, the "golden toilet" remained closed for years due to the dysfunctionality and was a subject of a lengthy anti-corruption investigation into those who had created it and &lt;ref name="archive.org5"/&gt; the local municipality even considered demolishing the building at one point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alfa.lt/straipsnis/10267128/kauno-apskrities-virsininko-administracija-kreipesi-i-teisma-del-auksinio-tualeto-griovimo|title=Alfa.lt – Kauno apskrities viršininko administracija kreipėsi į teismą dėl "auksinio" tualeto griovimo|date=18 November 2017|publisher=|accessdate=18 November 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118124213/https://www.alfa.lt/straipsnis/10267128/kauno-apskrities-virsininko-administracija-kreipesi-i-teisma-del-auksinio-tualeto-griovimo|archivedate=18 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group of public servants involved in the toilet's procurement received various prison sentences for recklessness, malfeasance, misuse of power and document falsifications in a 2012 court case, but were cleared of their corruption charges and received compensation, which pushed the total construction cost and subsequent related financial losses to 352'000 euros.

Various sources acclaim the [[People's Party (Spain)|Spanish People's Party]] – Partido Popular -, to be Europe's most corrupt party, with about yearly 45 billion euro worth of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lasemaineduroussillon.com/2017/09/22/plus-de-45-milliards-de-de-corruption-annuelle-rajoy-a-tete-parti-politique-plus-corrompu-deurope/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Police corruption====
{{main|Police corruption}}
Police corruption is a specific form of [[police misconduct]] designed to obtain financial benefits, personal gain, career advancement for a police officer or officers in exchange for not pursuing or selectively pursuing an investigation or arrest or aspects of the thin blue line itself where force members collude in lies to protect other members from accountability. One common form of police corruption is soliciting or accepting [[bribe]]s in exchange for not reporting organized drug or [[prostitution]] rings or other illegal activities.

Another example is police officers flouting the police [[code of conduct]] in order to secure convictions of suspects—for example, through the use of [[falsified evidence]]. More rarely, police officers may deliberately and systematically participate in [[organized crime]] themselves. In most major cities, there are [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] sections to investigate suspected police corruption or misconduct. Similar entities include the British [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]].

====Judicial corruption====
Judicial corruption refers to corruption-related [[judicial misconduct|misconduct of judges]], through receiving or giving bribes, improper sentencing of convicted criminals, bias in the hearing and judgement of arguments and other such misconduct.

Governmental corruption of judiciary is broadly known in many transitional and [[developing countries]] because the [[budget]] is almost completely controlled by the executive. The latter undermines the separation of powers, as it creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary. The proper national wealth distribution including the government spending on the judiciary is subject to the [[constitutional economics]].

It is important to distinguish between the two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the government (through budget planning and various privileges), and the private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Peter |last=Barenboim |title= Defining the rules |publisher= The European Lawyer |volume= Issue 90 |date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judicial corruption can be difficult to completely eradicate, even in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pahis|first1=Stratos|title=Corruption in Our Courts: What It Looks Like and Where It Is Hidden|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=2009|volume=118|accessdate=1 August 2015|url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/corruption-in-our-courts-what-it-looks-like-and-where-it-is-hidden}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Corruption in judiciary also involves the government in power using the judicial arm of government to oppress the opposition parties in the detriments of the state.

===Corruption in the education system===

===Within labor unions===
The Teamsters ([[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]]) is an example of how the civil [[RICO]] process can be used. For decades, the Teamsters have been substantially controlled by [[La Cosa Nostra]]. Since 1957, four of eight Teamster presidents were indicted, yet the union continued to be controlled by organized crime elements. The federal government has been successful at removing the criminal influence from this 1.4 million-member union by using the civil process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/organizedcrime/italian_mafia |title=FBI – Italian/Mafia |publisher=Fbi.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524172413/http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/organizedcrime/italian_mafia |archivedate=2014-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption in religion===
{{wikiquote|Corruption in religion}}
The history of religion includes numerous examples of religious leaders calling attention to corruption in the religious practices and institutions of their time. Jewish prophets [[Isaiah]] and [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] berate the rabbinical establishment of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Ancient Judea]] for failing to live up to the ideals of the [[Torah]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaiah]] 1:2–31, [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] 5:21–24.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] accuses the rabbinical establishment of his time of hypocritically following only the ceremonial parts of the Torah and neglecting the more important elements of justice, mercy and faithfulness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gospel of Matthew|Mt]] 23:13–33.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1517, [[Martin Luther]] accuses the [[Catholic Church]] of widespread corruption, including selling of [[w:Indulgence|indulgences]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Princeton University]] professor [[Kevin M. Kruse]] advances the thesis that business leaders in the 1930s and 1940s collaborated with clergymen, including [[James W. Fifield Jr.]], to develop and promote a new [[hermeneutical]] approach to Scripture that would de-emphasize the [[social Gospel]] and emphasize themes, such as [[individual salvation]], more congenial to [[free enterprise]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin M. Kruse]], ''One Nation Under God: How Corporate America Invented Christian America'' (2015), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

::Business leaders, of course, had long been working to "[[w:Merchandising|merchandise]]" themselves through the appropriation of religion. In organizations such as [[w:James W. Fifield Jr.#Spiritual Mobilization|Spiritual Mobilization]], the prayer breakfast groups, and the [[w:Freedoms Foundation|Freedoms Foundation]], they had linked [[capitalism]] and [[Christianity]] and, at the same time, likened the welfare state to godless paganism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin M. Kruse]], ''One Nation Under God: How Corporate America Invented Christian America'' (2015), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption in philosophy===
19th century German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] acknowledges that academics, including philosophers, are subject to the same sources of corruption as the society they inhabit. He distinguishes the corrupt "university" philosophers, whose "real concern is to earn with credit an honest livelihood for themselves and ... to enjoy a certain prestige in the eyes of the public"&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Schopenhauer]], “On Philosophy in the Universities,” ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', E. Payne, trans. (1974) Vol. 1, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; from the genuine philosopher, whose sole motive is to discover and bear witness to the truth.

::To be a philosopher, that is to say, a lover of wisdom (for wisdom is nothing but truth), it is not enough for a man to love truth, in so far as it is compatible with his own interest, with the will of his superiors, with the dogmas of the church, or with the prejudices and tastes of his contemporaries; so long as he rests content with this position, he is only a φίλαυτος [lover of self], not a φιλόσοφος [lover of wisdom]. For this title of honor is well and wisely conceived precisely by its stating that one should love the truth earnestly and with one’s whole heart, and thus unconditionally and unreservedly, above all else, and, if need be, in defiance of all else. Now the reason for this is the one previously stated that the intellect has become free, and in this state, it does not even know or understand any other interest than that of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Schopenhauer]], “Sketch for a history of the doctrine of the ideal and the real,” ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', E. Payne, trans. (1974) Vol. 1, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[criminology]], '''[[corporate crime]]''' refers to crimes committed either by a [[corporation]] (i.e., a [[business entity]] having a separate legal personality from the [[natural person]]s that manage its activities), or by individuals acting on behalf of a corporation or other business entity (see [[vicarious liability (criminal)|vicarious liability]] and [[corporate liability]]). Some negative behaviours by corporations may not be criminal; laws vary between jurisdictions. For example, some jurisdictions allow [[insider trading]].

"Arms for cash" can be done by either a state-sanctioned arms dealer, firm or state itself to another party it just in regards regards as only a good business partner and not political kindred or allies, thus making them no better than [[Arms trafficking|regular gun runners]].

The country is regarded poorly and that corruption is wounding the economy badly despite the emerging oil industries wealth.&lt;ref name="trans257"/&gt;

The '''[[Mitterrand–Pasqua affair]]''', also known informally as '''[[Angolagate]]''', was an international [[political scandal]] over the secret and illegal sale and shipment of arms from the nations of [[Central Europe]] to the government of [[Angola]] by the [[Cabinet of France|Government of France]] in the 1990s. It led to arrests and judiciary actions in the 2000s, involved an illegal arms sale to Angola despite a [[United Nations|UN]] embargo, with business interests in [[France]] and elsewhere improperly obtaining a share of Angolan oil revenues. The scandal has subsequently been tied to several prominent figures in French politics.&lt;ref name=trans257/&gt;

“Angolagate”, which was carried out and uncovered over the course of the 1990s. 42 individuals, including:  42 people, including Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, [[Jacques Attali]], [[Charles Pasqua]] and [[Jean-Charles Marchiani]], [[Pierre Falcone]]. [[Arcadi Gaydamak]], [[Paul-Loup Sulitzer]], [[Union for a Popular Movement]] deputy [[Georges Fenech]], {{ill|Philippe Courroye|fr}} the son of [[Francois Mitterrand]] and a former French Minister of the Interior, were all charged, accused, indicted or convicted with illegal arms trading, tax fraud, embezzlement, money laundering and other crimes.&lt;ref name=trans257/&gt;&lt;ref name=i&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/.WWW000000417_angolagate_les_principaux_acteurs_de_l_affaire.html |title =Angolagate: les principaux acteurs de l'affaire |publisher=[[Le Figaro]]| date= 2007-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; "&lt;ref name=j&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/news/newswire.php/news/reuters/2008/12/10/entertainment/french-writer-says-he39s-a-34mosquito34-in-arms-trial.html&amp;template=/news/feeds/story-template-reuters.html|title=French writer says he's a "mosquito" in arms trial|publisher=Reuters via Tiscali|date=2009-01-01}}{{dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
In [[systemic corruption]] and [[grand corruption]], multiple methods of corruption are used concurrently with similar aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Handbook on Practical Anti-Corruption Measures For Prosecutors and Investigators |url=http://www.unodc.org/pdf/corruption/publications_handbook_prosecutors.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bribery===
{{main|Bribery}}
Bribery involves the improper use of gifts and favours in exchange for personal gain. This is also known as [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] or, in the Middle East, as [[baksheesh]]. It is the common form of corruption. The types of favours given are diverse and may include money, gifts, sexual favours, company shares, entertainment, employment and political benefits. The personal gain that is given can be anything from actively giving preferential treatment to having an indiscretion or crime overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Bribery can sometimes form a part of the systemic use of corruption for other ends, for example to perpetrate further corruption. Bribery can make officials more susceptible to blackmail or to extortion.

===Embezzlement, theft and fraud===
{{main|Embezzlement}}
[[Embezzlement]] and [[theft]] involve someone with access to funds or assets illegally taking control of them. [[Fraud]] involves using deception to convince the owner of funds or assets to give them up to an unauthorized party.

Examples include the misdirection of company funds into "shadow companies" (and then into the pockets of corrupt employees), the skimming of [[foreign aid]] money, scams and other corrupt activity.

===Graft===
{{main|Graft (politics)}}
The political act of '''Graft''' (American English), is a well known and now global form of political corruption, being the unscrupulous and illegal use of a politician's authority for personal gain, when funds intended for public projects are intentionally misdirected in order to maximize the benefits to illegally private interests of the corrupted individual(s) and their cronies.

===Extortion and blackmail===
{{main|Extortion}}
While [[bribery]] is the use of positive inducements for corrupt aims, [[extortion]] and [[blackmail]] centre around the use of threats. This can be the threat of violence or false imprisonment as well as exposure of an individual's secrets or prior crimes.

This includes such behavior as an influential person threatening to go to the media if they do not receive speedy medical treatment (at the expense of other patients), threatening a public official with exposure of their secrets if they do not vote in a particular manner, or demanding money in exchange for continued secrecy.

===Influence peddling===
[[Influence peddling]] is the illegal practice of using one's influence in government or connections with persons in authority to obtain favours or preferential treatment for another, usually in return for payment.

===Networking===
{{main|Business networking}}
Networking can be an effective way for job-seekers to gain a competitive edge over others in the job-market. The idea is to cultivate personal relationships with prospective employers, selection panelists, and others, in the hope that these personal affections will influence future hiring decisions. This form of networking has been described as an attempt to corrupt formal hiring processes, where all candidates are given an equal opportunity to demonstrate their merits to selectors. The networker is accused of seeking non-meritocratic advantage over other candidates; advantage that is based on personal fondness rather than on any objective appraisal of which candidate is most qualified for the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/just-what-are-you-trying-to-pull-20130928-2ul2m.html|title=Just what are you trying to pull?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Networking, Corruption, and Subversion|first=Ned|last=Dobos|date=14 September 2015|journal=J Bus Ethics|volume = 144|issue=3|pages=1–12|doi=10.1007/s10551-015-2853-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abuse of discretion===
{{main|Abuse of discretion}}
[[Abuse of discretion]] refers to the misuse of one's powers and [[decision-making]] facilities. Examples include a judge improperly dismissing a criminal case or a customs official using their discretion to allow a banned substance through a port.

===Favoritism, nepotism and clientelism===
{{main|Nepotism}}
[[Cronyism|Favouritism]], [[nepotism]] and [[clientelism]] involve the favouring of not the perpetrator of corruption but someone related to them, such as a friend, family member or member of an association. Examples would include hiring or promoting a family member or staff member to a role they are not qualified for, who belongs to the same political party as you, regardless of merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/government-ethics/resources/what-is-government-ethics/favoritism-cronyism-and-nepotism/|title=Favoritism, Cronyism, and Nepotism|last=|first=|date=|work=Santa Clara|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states do not forbid these forms of corruption.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== Corruption and economic growth ==
Corruption is strongly negatively associated with the share of private investment and, hence, it lowers the rate of economic growth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mo, P.H. (2001). Corruption and Economic Growth. ''Journal of Comparative Economics, 29'', 66–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption reduces the returns of productive activities. If the returns to production fall faster than the returns to corruption and rent-seeking activities, resources will flow from productive activities to corruption activities over time. This will result in a lower stock of producible inputs like human capital in corrupted countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Corruption creates the opportunity for increased inequality, reduces the return of productive activities, and, hence, makes rentseeking and corruption activities more attractive. This opportunity for increased inequality not only generates psychological frustration to the underprivileged but also reduces productivity growth, investment, and job opportunities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Causes of corruption ==
According to a 2017 survey study, the following factors have been attributed as causes of corruption:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimant|first=Eugen|last2=Tosato|first2=Guglielmo|date=2017-01-01|title=Causes and Effects of Corruption: What Has Past Decade's Empirical Research Taught Us? a Survey|journal=Journal of Economic Surveys|volume=32|issue=2|language=en|pages=335–356|doi=10.1111/joes.12198|issn=1467-6419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preventing corruption ===
[[Robert Klitgaard|R. Klitgaard]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Klitgaard|Klitgaard, Robert]] (1998), Controlling Corruption, University of California Press, Berkeley, CA&lt;/ref&gt; postulates that corruption will occur if the corrupt gain is greater than the penalty multiplied by the likelihood of being caught and prosecuted:

Corrupt gain &gt; Penalty × Likelihood of being caught and prosecuted

The degree of corruption will then be a function of the degree of [[monopoly]] and discretion in deciding who should get how much on the one hand and the degree to which this activity is accountable and transparent on the other hand. Still, these equations (which should be understood in a qualitative rather than a quantitative manner) seem to be lacking one aspect: a high degree of monopoly and discretion accompanied by a low degree of transparency does not automatically lead to corruption without any moral weakness or insufficient integrity. Also, low penalties in combination with a low probability of being caught will only lead to corruption if people tend to neglect ethics and moral commitment. The original R.Klitgaard equation has therefore been amended by C. Stephan&lt;ref&gt;Stephan, Constantin (2012), Industrial Health, Safety and Environmental Management, MV Wissenschaft, Muenster, 3rd edition 2012, pp. 26–28, {{ISBN|978-3-86582-452-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; into:

According to Stephan, the moral dimension has an intrinsic and an extrinsic component. The intrinsic component refers to a mentality problem, the extrinsic component to external circumstances like poverty, inadequate remuneration, inappropriate work conditions and inoperable or over-complicated procedures which demoralize people and let them search for "alternative" solutions.

According to the amended Klitgaard equation, limitation of monopoly and regulator discretion of individuals and a high degree of transparency through independent oversight by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the media plus public access to reliable information could reduce the problem. Djankov and other researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Corruption in Developing Countries|journal=Annual Review of Economics|volume=4|pages=479–509|last=|first=|doi = 10.1146/annurev-economics-080511-110917|year = 2012|last1 = Olken|first1 = Benjamin A|last2=Pande|first2=Rohini|hdl=1721.1/73081}}{{dead link|date=August 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; have independently addressed the important role information plays in fighting corruption with evidence from both developing and developed countries. Disclosing financial information of government officials to the public is associated with improving institutional accountability and eliminating misbehavior such as vote buying. The effect is specifically remarkable when the disclosures concern politicians’ income sources, liabilities and asset level instead of just income level. Any extrinsic aspects that might reduce morality should be eliminated. Additionally, a country should establish a culture of ethical conduct in society with the government setting the good example in order to enhance the intrinsic morality.

===Enhancing Civil Society Participation ===
Creating bottom-up mechanisms, promoting citizens participation and encouraging the values of integrity, accountability, and transparency are crucial components of fighting corruption. The implementation of the ALACs “Advocacy and Legal Advice Centres (ALACs)” has led to a significant increase in the number of citizen complaints against acts of corruption received and documented&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00460|title=Increase in the number of civil complaints against acts of corruption.

The [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA, USA 1977) was an early paradigmatic law for many western countries i.e. industrial countries of the [[OECD]]. There, for the first time the old principal-agent approach was moved back where mainly the victim (a society, private or public) and a passive corrupt member (an individual) were considered, whereas the active corrupt part was not in the focus of legal prosecution. Unprecedented, the law of an industrial country directly condemned active corruption, particularly in international business transactions, which was at that time in contradiction to anti-bribery activities of the World Bank and its spin-off organization [[Transparency International]].

As early as 1989 the OECD had established an ad hoc Working Group in order to explore "...the concepts fundamental to the offense of corruption, and the exercise of national jurisdiction over offenses committed wholly or partially abroad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/gov/2001/eng/091801.pdf|format=PDF|title=IMF on OECD Convention, (page 3) Historical Background and Context|website=imf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Based on the FCPA concept, the Working Group presented in 1994 the then "OECD Anti-Bribery Recommendation" as precursor for the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/corruption/oecdantibriberyconvention.htm|title=OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Bearer of Transactions|website=oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was signed in 1997 by all member countries and came finally into force in 1999. However, because of ongoing concealed corruption in international transactions several instruments of Country Monitoring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/daf/anti-bribery/countrymonitoringoftheoecdanti-briberyconvention.htm|title=Country monitoring of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|website=oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been developed since then by the OECD in order to foster and evaluate related national activities in combating foreign corrupt practices. One survey shows that after the implementation of heightened review of multinational firms under the convention in 2010 firms from countries that had signed the convention were less likely to use bribery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=Nathan M.|last2=Malesky|first2=Edmund J.|title=Nonstate Actors and Compliance with International Agreements: An Empirical Analysis of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|journal=International Organization|volume=72|issue=1|pages=33–69|doi=10.1017/S0020818317000443|language=en|issn=0020-8183|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a document&lt;ref name="partnerplatform"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://partnerplatform.org/?7vz3z60x |title=Forgues-Puccio, G.F. April 2013, Existing practices on anti-corruption, Economic and private sector professional evidence and applied knowledge services helpdesk request |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced by the economic and private sector professional evidence and applied knowledge services help-desk discusses some of the existing practices on anti-corruption. They found:
* The theories behind the fight against corruption are moving from a [[Principal agent problem|Principal agent approach]] to a [[collective action problem]]. [[Principal-agent]] theories seem not to be suitable to target systemic corruption.
* The role of multilateral institutions has been crucial in the fight against corruption. [[UNCAC]] provides a common guideline for countries around the world. Both [[Transparency International]] and the [[World Bank]] provide assistance to national governments in term of diagnostic and design of anti-corruption policies.
* The use of anti-corruption agencies have proliferated in recent years after the signing of [[UNCAC]]. They found no convincing evidence on the extent of their contribution, or the best way to structure them.
* Traditionally anti-corruption policies have been based on success experiences and common sense. In recent years there has been an effort to provide a more systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of anti-corruption policies. They found that this literature is still in its infancy.
* Anti-corruption policies that may be in general recommended to developing countries may not be suitable for post-conflict countries. Anti-corruption policies in fragile states have to be carefully tailored.
* Anti-corruption policies can improve the business environment. There is evidence that lower corruption may facilitate doing business and improve firm’s productivity. [[Rwanda]] in the last decade has made tremendous progress in improving governance and the business environment providing a model to follow for post-conflict countries.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;

In some countries people travel to corruption hot spots or a specialist tour company takes them on corruption city tours, as it is the case in [[Prague]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303360504577408381452443206|title=Czech Republic Has Its Answer to the Beverly Hills Star Tour|last=Carney|first=Gordon Fairclough And Sean|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://travel.cnn.com/meet-strangest-startup-travel-corrupttour-162581/|title=Meet the strangest startup in travel: CorruptTour {{!}} CNN Travel|website=travel.cnn.com|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/world/europe/on-the-crony-safari-a-tour-of-a-citys-corruption.html|title=On the Crony Safari, a Tour of a City’s Corruption|last=Bilefsky|first=Dan|date=2013-08-12|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-27390314|title=Corruption redefined as tourism in Czech Republic – BBC News|website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption tours have also occurred in [[Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chicago-corruption-tour-idUSKCN0XU17Q|title=So much corruption, stuffed into one Chicago tour|date=2017-05-03|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mexico City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/tour-bus-offers-sightseeing-emblematic-corruption-spots-mexico-city|title=Tour Bus Offers Sightseeing of Emblematic Corruption Spots in Mexico City|last=Político*|first=Animal|website=www.insightcrime.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21717980-corruptour-has-its-own-take-capitals-monuments-using-tourism-teach-mexicans-about|title=Using tourism to teach Mexicans about corruption|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal corruption==
Though corruption is often viewed as illegal, there is an evolving concept of legal corruption,&lt;ref name="Legal Corruption"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaufmann|first1=Daniel|first2=Pedro|last2=Vicente|year=2011|url=http://www.pedrovicente.org/legal.pdf|format=PDF|title=Legal Corruption (revised)|website= Economics and Politics, v23 |pages= 195–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Original research inline|date=May 2014}} as developed by [[Daniel Kaufmann (economist)|Daniel Kaufmann]] and Pedro Vicente.  It might be termed as processes which are corrupt, but are protected by a legal (that is, specifically permitted, or at least not proscribed by law) framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaufmann|first1=Daniel|first2=Pedro|last2=Vicente|year=2011|url=http://www.pedrovicente.org/legal.pdf|format=PDF|title=Legal Corruption (revised)|website=Economics and Politics, v23|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples of legal corruption ===
In 1977 the USA had enacted the ''[[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]]'' (FCPA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/|title=Foreign Corrupt Practices Act|website=justice.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; "for the purpose of making it unlawful... to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business" and invited all OECD countries to follow suit. In 1997 a corresponding [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] was signed by its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/daf/anti-bribery/ConvCombatBribery_ENG.pdf |title=Report |website= oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oecd.org/gov/ethics/2406452.pdf|title= Report |website=oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

17 years after the FCPA enacting, a Parliamentary Financial Commission in Bonn presented a comparative study on legal corruption in industrialized OECD countries&lt;ref name=study&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/12/084/1208468.pdf|format=PDF|title=Drucksache 12/8468|website= Bonn Parliament records|date=September 8, 1994|pages= 4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, they reported that in most industrial countries even at that time (1994) foreign corruption was legal, and that their foreign corrupt practices had been diverging to a large extent, ranging from simple legalization, through governmental subsidization (tax deduction), up to extremes like in Germany where foreign corruption was fostered, whereas domestic was legally prosecuted.
Consequently, in order to support national export corporations the Parliamentary Financial Commission recommended to reject a related previous Parliamentary Proposal by the opposition leader which had been aiming to limit German foreign corruption on the basis of the US FCPA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/12/084/1208468.pdf Drucksache 12/8468:] "Die Ablehnung erfolgte mit den Stimmen der Koalitionsfraktionen gegen die Stimmen der Fraktion der SPD bei Abwesenheit der Gruppen BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN und der PDS/Linke Liste."&lt;/ref&gt;
Only after the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] came into force, did Germany withdraw the legalization of foreign corruption in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;§ 4 chapter 5 no. 10 Income Tax Act, valid until 19 March 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

====Foreign corrupt practices of industrialized OECD countries 1994 study====
The Foreign corrupt practices of industrialized OECD countries 1994 (Parliamentary Financial Commission study, Bonn).&lt;ref name=study /&gt;

Belgium: bribe payments are generally tax deductible as business expenses if the name and address of the beneficiary is disclosed. Under the following conditions kickbacks in connection with exports abroad are permitted for deduction even without proof of the receiver:
* Payments must be necessary in order to be able to survive against foreign competition
* They must be common in the industry
* A corresponding application must be made to the Treasury each year
* Payments must be appropriate
* The payer has to pay a lump-sum to the tax office to be fixed by the Finance Minister (at least 20% of the amount paid).
In the absence of the required conditions, for corporate taxable companies paying bribes without proof of the receiver, a special tax of 200% is charged. This special tax may, however, be abated along with the bribe amount as an operating expense.

Denmark: bribe payments are deductible when a clear operational context exists and its adequacy is maintained.

France: basically all operating expenses can be deducted. However, staff costs must correspond to an actual work done and must not be excessive compared to the operational significance. This also applies to payments to foreign parties. Here, the receiver shall specify the name and address, unless the total amount in payments per beneficiary does not exceed 500 FF. If the receiver is not disclosed the payments are considered "rémunérations occult" and are associated with the following disadvantages:
* The business expense deduction (of the bribe money) is eliminated.
* For corporations and other legal entities, a tax penalty of 100% of the "rémunérations occult" and 75% for voluntary post declaration is to be paid.
* There may be a general fine of up 200 FF fixed per case.

Japan: in Japan, bribes are deductible as business expenses that are justified by the operation (of the company) if the name and address of the recipient is specified. This also applies to payments to foreigners. If the indication of the name is refused, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses.

Canada: there is no general rule on the deductibility or non-deductibility of kickbacks and bribes. Hence the rule is that necessary expenses for obtaining the income (contract) are deductible. Payments to members of the public service and domestic administration of justice, to officers and employees and those charged with the collection of fees, entrance fees etc. for the purpose to entice the recipient to the violation of his official duties, can not be abated as business expenses as well as illegal payments according to the Criminal Code.

Luxembourg: bribes, justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authorities may require that the payer is to designate the receiver by name. If not, the expenses are not recognized as operating expenses.

Netherlands: all expenses that are directly or closely related to the business are deductible. This also applies to expenditure outside the actual business operations if they are considered beneficial as to the operation for good reasons by the management. What counts is the good merchant custom. Neither the law nor the administration is authorized to determine which expenses are not operationally justified and therefore not deductible. For the business expense deduction it is not a requirement that the recipient is specified. It is sufficient to elucidate to the satisfaction of the tax authorities that the payments are in the interest of the operation.

Austria: bribes justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authority may require that the payer names the recipient of the deducted payments exactly. If the indication of the name is denied e.g. because of business comity, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses. This principle also applies to payments to foreigners.

Switzerland: bribe payments are tax deductible if it is clearly operation initiated and the consignee is indicated.

US: (rough résumé: "generally operational expenses are deductible if they are not illegal according to the FCPA")

UK: kickbacks and bribes are deductible if they have been paid for operating purposes. The tax authority may request the name and address of the recipient."

===="Specific" legal corruption: exclusively against foreign countries====
Referring to the recommendation of the above-mentioned Parliamentary Financial Commission's study,&lt;ref name=study /&gt; the then Kohl administration (1991–1994) decided to maintain the legality of corruption against officials exclusively in foreign transactions&lt;ref&gt;the term "official" had been limited to German jurisdiction. Officials of other states legally were no "officials". See [https://books.google.com/books?id=XQYc-dAIF0MC&amp;pg=PA109 für Rolf Keller"] Essay in Memory for Rolf Keller, 2003, Edited by Criminal Law professors from the Law Faculty of Tübingen and the Ministry of Justice of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany, page 104: "Nach der Legaldefinition des §11 I Nr.2a StGB versteht man unter einem Amtsträger u.&amp;nbsp;a. eine Person, die &gt;&gt;nach deutschem Recht Beamter oder Richter ist. Die Vorschrift enthält also eine vom Wortlaut her eindeutige Einschränkung auf das deutsche Recht. Ausländische Amtsträger werden somit nicht erfasst."&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed the full deductibility of bribe money, co-financing thus a specific nationalistic corruption practice (§4 Abs. 5 Nr. 10 EStG, valid until March 19, 1999) in contradiction to the 1994 OECD recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/investment/anti-bribery/anti-briberyconvention/1952622.pdf|title=OECD: Recommendation of the Council on Bribery in International Business Transactions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The respective law was not changed before the OECD Convention also in Germany came into force (1999).&lt;ref&gt;Britta Bannenberg, ''Korruption in Deutschland und ihre strafrechtliche Kontrolle'', page VII (Introduction): "Durch die OECD-Konvention und europaweite Abkommen wurden auch in Deutschland neue Anti-Korruptions-Gesetze geschaffen, so dass nun die Auslandsbestechung durch deutsche Unternehmen dem Strafrecht unterfällt und die Bestechungsgelder nicht mehr als Betriebsausgaben von der Steuer abgesetzt werden können."&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the Parliamentary Financial Commission's study, however, in 1994 most countries' corruption practices were not nationalistic and much more limited by the respective laws compared to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary Financial Commission's study 1994, pp. 6–7: [http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/12/084/1208468.pdf "Nach Auffassung der Fraktion der SPD belegt auch der Bericht der Bundesregierung eindeutig, daß in den meisten ausländischen Industriestaaten Schmier- und Bestechungsgelder in wesentlich geringerem Umfang als in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland steuerlich abgesetzt werden könnten. So müsse in fast allen Staaten bei Zahlungen in das Ausland der Empfänger angegeben werden... Die Abzugsfähigkeit der genannten Ausgaben (Schmier- und Bestechungsgelder) stelle eine steuerliche Subvention dar..."]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:German_Shadow_Economy.png|thumb|Development of the shadow economy in [[Germany|(West-) Germany 1975–2015]]. Original [[shadow economy]] data from Friedrich Schneider, University Linz.]]
Particularly, the non-disclosure of the bribe money recipients' name in tax declarations had been a powerful instrument for Legal Corruption during the 1990s for German corporations, enabling them to block foreign legal jurisdictions which intended to fight corruption in their countries. Hence, they uncontrolled established a strong network of clientelism around Europe (e.g. SIEMENS)&lt;ref name=blackaccounts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrr-strafrecht.de/hrr/archiv/08-02/index.php?sz=6#67|title=HRRS Februar 2008: Saliger/Gaede – Rückwirkende Ächtung der Auslandskorruption und Untreue als Korruptionsdelikt – Der Fall Siemens als Start-schuss in ein entgrenztes internationalisiertes Wirtschaftsstrafrecht? · hrr-strafrecht.de|website=hrr-strafrecht.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the formation of the [[European Single Market]] in the upcoming [[European Union]] and the [[Eurozone]].
Moreover, in order to further strengthen active corruption the prosecution of tax evasion during that decade had been severely limited. German tax authorities were instructed to refuse any disclosure of bribe recipients' names from tax declarations to the German criminal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Transparency International: [http://www.transparency.org/news/pressrelease/ach_das_mit_der_prostitution "Geschützt durch das Steuergeheimnis dürfen die Steuerbehörden Hinweise auf Korruption nicht an die Staatsanwaltschaft melden."]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, German corporations have been systematically increasing their informal economy from 1980 until today up to 350 bn € per annum (see diagram on the right), thus continuously feeding their black money reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/20063/umfrage/entwicklung-des-umfangs-der-schattenwirtschaft-seit-1995|title= Schattenwirtschaft – Umfang in Deutschland bis 2015 – Statistik|website=Statista}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A Siemens corruption case ===
In 2007, [[Siemens]] was convicted in the District Court of [[Darmstadt]] of criminal corruption against the Italian corporation [[Enel Green Power|Enel Power SpA]]. Siemens had paid almost €3.5 million in bribes to be selected for a €200 million project from the Italian corporation, partially owned by the government. The deal was handled through [[black money]] accounts in [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] that were established specifically for such purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrr-strafrecht.de/hrr/archiv/08-02/index.php?sz=6|title=HRRS Februar 2008: Saliger/Gaede – Rückwirkende Ächtung der Auslandskorruption und Untreue als Korruptionsdelikt – Der Fall Siemens als Start-schuss in ein entgrenztes internationalisiertes Wirtschaftsstrafrecht? – hrr-strafrecht.de|website=hrr-strafrecht.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because the crime was committed in 1999, after the OECD convention had come into force, this foreign corrupt practice could be prosecuted. According to Bucerius Law School professors Frank Saliger and Karsten Gaede, for the first time a German court of law convicted foreign corrupt practices like national ones although the corresponding law did not yet protect foreign competitors in business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrr-strafrecht.de/hrr/archiv/08-02/index.php?sz=6#62|title=HRRS Februar 2008: Saliger/Gaede – Rückwirkende Ächtung der Auslandskorruption und Untreue als Korruptionsdelikt – Der Fall Siemens als Start-schuss in ein entgrenztes internationalisiertes Wirtschaftsstrafrecht? · hrr-strafrecht.de|website=hrr-strafrecht.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the judicial proceedings however it was disclosed that numerous such black accounts had been established in the past decades.&lt;ref name=blackaccounts /&gt;

== Historical responses in philosophical and religious thought ==
Philosophers and religious thinkers have responded to the inescapable reality of corruption in different ways. [[Plato]], in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', acknowledges the corrupt nature of political institutions, and recommends that philosophers "shelter behind a wall" to avoid senselessly martyring themselves.

''Disciples of philosophy ... have tasted how sweet and blessed a possession philosophy is, and have also seen and been satisfied of the madness of the multitude, and known that there is no one who ever acts honestly in the administration of States, nor any helper who will save any one who maintains the cause of the just. Such a savior would be like a man who has fallen among wild beasts—unable to join in the wickedness of his fellows, neither would he be able alone to resist all their fierce natures, and therefore he would be of no use to the State or to his friends, and would have to throw away his life before he had done any good to himself or others. And he reflects upon all this, and holds his peace, and does his own business. He is like one who retires under the shelter of a wall in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries along; and when he sees the rest of mankind full of wickedness, he is content if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or unrighteousness, and depart in peace and good will, with bright hopes.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [[Plato]], ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', 496d&lt;/ref&gt;''

The [[New Testament]], in keeping with the tradition of Ancient Greek thought, also frankly acknowledges the corruption of the world (ὁ [[wikt:κόσμος|κόσμος]])&lt;ref&gt;2 Peter 1:4, 2:20.&lt;/ref&gt; and claims to offer a way of keeping the spirit "unspotted from the world."&lt;ref&gt;James 1:27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul of Tarsus]] acknowledges his readers must inevitably "deal with the world,"&lt;ref&gt;1 Cor 7:31.&lt;/ref&gt; and recommends they adopt an attitude of "as if not" in all their dealings. When they buy a thing, for example, they should relate to it "as if it were not theirs to keep."&lt;ref&gt;1 Cor 7:30.&lt;/ref&gt; New Testament readers are advised to refuse to "conform to the present age"&lt;ref&gt;Romans 12:2.&lt;/ref&gt; and not to be ashamed to be peculiar or singular.&lt;ref&gt;1 Peter 2:9.&lt;/ref&gt; They are advised not be friends of the corrupt world, because "friendship with the world is enmity with God."&lt;ref&gt;James 4:4.&lt;/ref&gt; They are advised not to love the corrupt world or the things of the world.&lt;ref&gt;1 John 2:15.&lt;/ref&gt; The rulers of this world, Paul explains, "are coming to nothing"&lt;ref&gt;1 Cor 2:6.&lt;/ref&gt; While readers must obey corrupt rulers in order to live in the world,&lt;ref&gt;Romans 13:1.&lt;/ref&gt; the spirit is subject to no law but to love God and love our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;Romans 13:8.&lt;/ref&gt; New Testament readers are advised to adopt a disposition in which they are "in the world, but not of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L. Fitz-Gibbon, ''In the World But Not Of the World: Christian Social Thinking at the End of the Twentieth Century'' (2000), See also John 15:19.&lt;/ref&gt; This disposition, Paul claims, shows us a way to escape "slavery to corruption" and experience the freedom and glory of being innocent "children of God".&lt;ref&gt;Roman 8:21.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13845">'''Domain engineering''', also called '''product line engineering''', is the entire process of reusing [[domain knowledge]] in the production of new [[software]] systems. It is a key concept in systematic [[code reuse|software reuse]]. A key idea in systematic software reuse is the [[domain (software engineering)|domain]]. Most organizations work in only a few domains. They repeatedly build similar systems within a given domain with variations to meet different customer needs. Rather than building each new system variant from scratch, significant savings may be achieved by reusing portions of previous systems in the domain to build new ones.

The process of identifying domains, bounding them, and discovering commonalities and variabilities among the systems in the domain is called [[domain analysis]]. This information is captured in models that are used in the domain implementation phase to create artifacts such as reusable components, a [[domain-specific language]], or application generators that can be used to build new systems in the domain.

==Purpose==
Domain engineering is designed to improve the quality of developed software products through reuse of software artifacts.&lt;ref name="Frakes 2"&gt;{{harvnb|Frakes|Kang|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domain engineering shows that most developed software systems are not new systems but rather variants of other systems within the same field.&lt;ref name="Frakes 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Frakes|Kang|2007|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, through the use of domain engineering, businesses can maximize profits and reduce time-to-market by using the concepts and implementations from prior software systems and applying them to the target system.&lt;ref name="Frakes 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cza 19"&gt;{{harvnb|Czarnecki|Eisenecker|2000|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction in cost is evident even during the implementation phase. One study showed that the use of domain-specific languages allowed code size, in both number of [[method (computer science)|methods]] and number of [[debugging symbol|symbols]], to be reduced by over 50%, and the total number of [[lines of code]] to be reduced by nearly 75%.&lt;ref name="Batory 19"&gt;{{harvnb|Batory|Johnson|MacDonald|von Heeder|2002|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domain engineering focuses on capturing knowledge gathered during the [[software engineering]] process. By developing reusable artifacts, components can be reused in new software systems at low cost and high quality.&lt;ref name="Cza 20"&gt;{{harvnb|Czarnecki|Eisenecker|2000|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because this applies to all [[software development process|phases of the software development cycle]], domain engineering also focuses on the three primary phases: analysis, design, and implementation, paralleling application engineering.&lt;ref name="Cza 21"&gt;{{harvnb|Czarnecki|Eisenecker|2000|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This produces not only a set of [[source code|software implementation]] components relevant to the domain, but also reusable and configurable requirements and designs.&lt;ref name="Harsu 8"&gt;{{harvnb|Harsu|2002|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the growth of data on the Web and the growth of the [[Internet of Things]], a domain engineering approach is becoming relevant to other disciplines as well.&lt;ref name="ReinhartzBerger 24"&gt;{{harvnb|Reinhartz-Berger|Sturm|Clark|Cohen|Bettin|2013|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of deep chains of Web services highlights that the service concept is relative. Web services developed and operated by one organization can be utilized as part of a platform by another organization. As services may be used in different contexts and hence require different configurations, the design of families of services may benefit from a domain engineering approach.

==Phases==
[[File:Domain Engineering vs Application Engineering.svg|Domain engineering as compared to application engineering. The outputs of each phase of domain engineering feed into both subsequent phases of domain engineering as well as corresponding phases in application engineering.|thumb|330px]]
Domain engineering, like application engineering, consists of three primary phases: analysis, design, and implementation. However, where software engineering focuses on a ''single'' system, domain engineering focuses on a ''family'' of systems.&lt;ref name="Cza 21" /&gt; A good domain model serves as a reference to resolve ambiguities later in the process, a repository of knowledge about the domain characteristics and definition, and a specification to developers of products which are part of the domain.&lt;ref name="Falbo 2"&gt;{{harvnb|Falbo|Guizzardi|Duarte|2002|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domain analysis===
Domain analysis is used to define the domain, collect information about the domain, and produce a [[domain model]].&lt;ref name="Cza 23"&gt;{{harvnb|Czarnecki|Eisenecker|2000|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of [[feature model]]s (initially conceived as part of the [[feature-oriented domain analysis]] method), domain analysis aims to identify the common points in a domain and the varying points in the domain.&lt;ref name="Cza 38"&gt;{{harvnb|Czarnecki|Eisenecker|2000|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of domain analysis, the development of ''configurable'' requirements and architectures, rather than ''static'' configurations which would be produced by a traditional application engineering approach, is possible.&lt;ref name="Kang 7"&gt;{{harvnb|Kang|Lee|Kim|Kim|2004|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domain analysis is significantly different from [[requirements engineering]], and as such, traditional approaches to deriving requirements are ineffective for development of configurable requirements as would be present in a domain model. To effectively apply domain engineering, reuse must be considered in the earlier phases of the [[software development life cycle]]. Through the use of selection of features from developed feature models, consideration of reuse of technology is performed very early and can be adequately applied throughout the development process.&lt;ref name="Kang 3"&gt;{{harvnb|Kang|Lee|Kim|Kim|2004|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domain analysis is derived primarily from artifacts produced from past experience in the domain.&lt;ref name="Cza 23" /&gt; Existing systems, their artifacts (such as [[design document]]s, [[software requirements specification|requirement documents]] and [[user manual]]s), [[technical standard|standards]], and customers are all potential sources of domain analysis input.&lt;ref name="Cza 23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kang 4"&gt;{{harvnb|Kang|Lee|Kim|Kim|2004|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike requirements engineering, domain analysis does not solely consist of collection and formalization of information; a creative component exists as well. During the domain analysis process, engineers aim to extend knowledge of the domain beyond what is already known and to categorize the domain into similarities and differences to enhance reconfigurability.&lt;ref name="Cza 23" /&gt;

Domain analysis primarily produces a [[domain model]], representing the common and varying properties of systems within the domain.&lt;ref name="Cza 23" /&gt; The domain model assists with the creation of architectures and components in a configurable manner by acting as a foundation upon which to design these components.&lt;ref name="Frakes 3"&gt;{{harvnb|Frakes|Kang|2007|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An effective domain model not only includes the varying and consistent features in a domain, but also defines the vocabulary used in the domain and defines concepts, ideas and phenomena, within the system.&lt;ref name="Cza 23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cza 84"&gt;{{harvnb|Czarnecki|Eisenecker|2000|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feature models decompose concepts into their required and optional features to produce a fully formalized set of configurable requirements.&lt;ref name="Cza 86"&gt;{{harvnb|Czarnecki|Eisenecker|2000|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domain design===
Domain design takes the domain model produced during the domain analysis phase and aims to produce a generic architecture to which all systems within the domain can conform.&lt;ref name="Cza 24"&gt;{{harvnb|Czarnecki|Eisenecker|2000|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way that application engineering uses the [[functional requirement|functional]] and [[non-functional requirement]]s to produce a design, the domain design phase of domain engineering takes the configurable requirements developed during the domain analysis phase and produces a configurable, standardized solution for the family of systems. Domain design aims to produce architectural patterns which solve a problem common across the systems within the domain, despite differing requirement configurations.&lt;ref name="Cza 25"&gt;{{harvnb|Czarnecki|Eisenecker|2000|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the development of patterns during domain design, engineers must also take care to identify the scope of the pattern and the level to which context is relevant to the pattern. Limitation of context is crucial: too much context results in the pattern not being applicable to many systems, and too little context results in the pattern being insufficiently powerful to be useful.&lt;ref name="Buschmann 42"&gt;{{harvnb|Buschmann|Henney|Schmidt|2007|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; A useful pattern must be both frequently recurring and of high quality.&lt;ref name="Buschmann 31"&gt;{{harvnb|Buschmann|Henney|Schmidt|2007|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective of domain design is to satisfy as many domain requirements as possible while retaining the flexibility offered by the developed feature model. The architecture should be sufficiently flexible to satisfy all of the systems within the domain while rigid enough to provide a solid framework upon which to base the solution.&lt;ref name="Cza 28"&gt;{{harvnb|Czarnecki|Eisenecker|2000|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domain implementation===
Domain implementation is the creation of a process and tools for efficiently generating a customized program in the domain.

==Criticism==
Lately, domain engineering has been criticized for focusing too much on "engineering-for-reuse" or "engineering-with-reuse" of generic software features rather than concentrating on "engineering-for-use" such that an individual's world-view, language, or context is integrated into the design of software.&lt;ref name="Mettler"&gt;{{harvnb|Mettler|2017|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Easy Goer''' (March 21, 1986&amp;nbsp;– May 12, 1994) was an American [[Champion]] [[Hall of Fame]] [[Thoroughbred]] racehorse known for earning [[American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt]] honors in 1988 and defeating 1989 [[American Horse of the Year]] [[Sunday Silence]] in the [[Belmont Stakes]] by eight [[horse length|lengths]].  Both horses were later voted into the [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|American Hall of Fame]].  The victory deprived Sunday Silence of the [[United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]].  It was also the second-fastest Belmont in history, behind only the record performance of [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]] in 1973. Easy Goer was the first two-year-old champion to win a Triple Crown race since [[Spectacular Bid]] in 1979.  Easy Goer also ran the fastest mile on dirt by any three-year-old in the history of [[Thoroughbred racing]]  with a time of 1:32 2/5, which was a second faster than Secretariat's [[Stakes race|stakes]] record, and one-fifth of a second off of the world record set by [[Dr. Fager]] in 1968.

Easy Goer is the only horse in racing history to win the Belmont, Whitney, Travers, Woodward and Jockey Club Gold Cup and the only 3-year-old to win the Whitney, Woodward and Jockey Club Gold Cup while defeating older horses in the latter three. Easy Goer is one of only two horses to win the Champagne, Belmont, and Travers.  He is also one of only two horses to notch a Travers, Whitney and Belmont Stakes triple, and the only one to do so in the same year.   Additionally, he is one of only five horses to tally a Whitney-Travers double in the same year.   Since 1919, Easy Goer is one of only ten horses to sweep the Belmont, Travers and Jockey Club Gold Cup.  Since 1973, Easy Goer is one of only seven horses that have won three consecutive Grade I races longer than 1 1/8 miles on dirt (or synthetic).   On the [[Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century|''Blood-Horse'' List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century]], Easy Goer is ranked #34.

===1988: two-year-old season===
Before his career began, Easy Goer was shipped to McGaughey at the Payson Park Training Center in [[Indiantown, Florida]], where he spent the winter getting acquainted with the [[starting gate]] and underwent basic training. His trainer noted some faults in his [[equine conformation|conformation]]. He had puffy, problematic [[fetlock|ankles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-11-08/sports/sp-1011_1_easy-goer|title=HORSE RACING : Maybe It's Time Easy Goer Gets a Different Rider |accessdate=2013-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[clubfoot]], and a turned-out left knee, all providing the potential for injury once the horse began serious workouts.&lt;ref name="Stathoplos"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.si.com/vault/1989/05/08/106780239/a-tale-of-two-horse | work=Sports Illustrated | first=Demmie | last=Stathoplos | title=A Tale Of Two Horse | date=May 8, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, McGaughey was captivated with Easy Goer the first time he saw him, but really felt he had something special when he watched him for the first time with a set of horses. "He gave the impression he could gallop those horses to death," McGaughey said.&lt;ref name="Haskin"/&gt;
  
At age two, Easy Goer won his [[maiden race]] at seven [[furlong]]s at [[Saratoga Race Course]] under a hand ride in a final time of 1:22 3/5, defeating [[Is It True (horse)|Is It True]] by two and a half lengths after being forwardly placed two lengths off the early leaders and having to steady on the backstretch, and, as McGaughey stated, "Running two or three seconds faster than the other maiden race run at the same distance that day at Saratoga."&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/choice-fame-easy-article-1.771584  | work=Daily News |first=Sherry |last=Ross |title=CHOICE FOR FAME VERY EASY |date=August 5, 1997 |accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Easy Goer's time was notably impressive taking into account that it was approximately fifteen lengths faster than that aforementioned maiden race run at the same distance that day at Saratoga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/12/sports/sports-of-the-times-phipps-s-barn-is-the-home-of-the-stars.html  | work=The New York Times |first=Steven |last=Crist |title=SPORTS OF THE TIMES; Phipps's Barn Is the Home of the Stars |date=September 12, 1988 |accessdate=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Easy Goer came out of that race with a sore left [[cannon bone|shin]]. McGaughey was concerned because he thought he might have to stop the colt's training; however, treatment by hosing and [[poultice|poulticing]] the leg to draw out the heat was successful. McGaughey decided to wait and have Easy Goer's legs further treated after the [[Breeders' Cup]] that November. Easy Goer continued to train at Saratoga.&lt;ref name="Stathoplos"/&gt; He then won a  6 1/2 furlong [[allowance race]] by five and a half lengths at [[Belmont Park]], again under little urging, running one-fifth of a second off the track record in 1:15 2/5, while carrying five pounds more than his opponents. Easy Goer's time was particularly exceptional considering that on the same day at Belmont, older allowance horses ran the same distance just under two seconds slower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/12/sports/sports-of-the-times-phipps-s-barn-is-the-home-of-the-stars.html  | work=The New York Times |first=Steven |last=Crist |title=SPORTS OF THE TIMES; Phipps's Barn Is the Home of the Stars |date=September 12, 1988 |accessdate=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   His trainer said after the race, "Then I knew I was training something special."&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt; Easy Goer next won the seven-furlong [[Graded stakes race|Grade I]] [[Cowdin Stakes]] with little encouragement, defeating Is It True again by four lengths. Easy Goer was never more than three and a half lengths behind the early leaders, who ran quick early fractions of 22 2/5 and 45 3/5, before drawing away through the stretch. He also defeated [[Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt]] Mercedes Won, who was the [[Hopeful Stakes]] and [[Florida Derby]] winner. He ran the seven furlongs in 1:23 3/5. The final time was more than two seconds off Devil's Bag's 1983 stakes record, but the Belmont track was producing uncommonly slow times that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/02/sports/horse-racing-easy-goer-captures-cowdin.html | location=New York | work=New York Times | title=HORSE RACING; Easy Goer Captures Cowdin }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later Easy Goer won the $557,000 one-mile Grade I [[Champagne Stakes (USA)|Champagne Stakes]] with little exertion, again defeating Is It True by four lengths, after vying for command and running a half length to a length and a half behind the leader through fast fractions of 22 4/5 and 45 3/5. He also defeated the [[Belmont Futurity]] winner Trapp Mountain and [[Young America Stakes]] winner Irish Actor. His 1:34 4/5 final time for the mile was three-fifths of a second off the Champagne stakes record, and tied for fourth-fastest in Champagne Stakes history behind Vitriolic, [[Seattle Slew]] (1:34 2/5), and [[Devil's Bag]] (1:34 1/5).  In the [[Frizette Stakes]] run at the same distance that day at Belmont, future Hall of Fame champion [[Open Mind (horse)|Open Mind]] fell a nose short of catching Some Romance at the wire. Some Romance ran the mile in 1:36 4/5, two seconds, or approximately 12 lengths, slower than Easy Goer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/16/sports/horse-racing-easy-goer-wins-champagne.html | location=New York | work=New York Times | title=HORSE RACING; Easy Goer Wins Champagne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in this Champagne Stakes, Easy Goer ran the fastest [[Beyer Speed Figure]] performance (116 Beyer)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rztm-KHHBt4C&amp;pg=PA185&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;dq=easy+goer+beyers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NtvS5CO5Bf&amp;sig=qBlpjm_UNwJ5noTncaWJi8ZzYEA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sSaNU6CTGrC-sQTF3YKABg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=easy%20goer%20beyers&amp;f=false |work=Beyer on Speed | first=Andrew | last=Beyer | title=Beyer on Speed | date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; of any two-year-old since Beyer racing figures were first published.&lt;ref name="Beyer"/&gt;  Racing analyst [[Andrew Beyer]] stated, "Easy Goer was the most brilliant American two-year-old of the decade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rztm-KHHBt4C&amp;pg=PA185&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;dq=easy+goer+beyers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NtvS5CO5Bf&amp;sig=qBlpjm_UNwJ5noTncaWJi8ZzYEA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sSaNU6CTGrC-sQTF3YKABg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=easy%20goer%20beyers&amp;f=false |work=Beyer on Speed | first=Andrew | last=Beyer | title=Beyer on Speed | date=1993  |accessdate=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Racing writer Steven Crist stated, "Easy Goer is among the fastest two-year-olds of the last two decades."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/31/sports/breeders-cup-three-stars-will-be-racing-for-more-than-just-a-victory.html  | work=The New York Times |first=Steven |last=Crist |title=Breeders' Cup; Three Stars Will Be Racing For More Than Just a Victory |date=October 31, 1988 |accessdate=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He finished second by a little more than a length in his last race of his two-year-old season, the Grade 1 [[Breeders' Cup Juvenile]] on a muddy track at Churchill Downs. He lost to Is It True, a horse he had defeated three times earlier in the year by a combined ten and a half lengths, having jumped the tire tracks left by the [[starting gate]] late in the homestretch, and seemed to be struggling and uncomfortable with the muddy Churchill track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.breederscup.com/history-tradition/hall-champions/it-true | location=breederscup.com | work=breederscup.com | title=history/hall of champions -Homepage - breederscup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He earned $697,500 and was named [[Eclipse Award|Champion two-year-old colt]] and was the early favorite for the [[Kentucky Derby]]. After the Breeders' Cup, he was shipped to New York to have his shins [[pinfiring|pinfired]], and then sent to [[Gulfstream Park]] in [[Hallandale, Florida]], to recuperate.&lt;ref name="Stathoplos"/&gt;

===1989: three-year-old season===
At three, Easy Goer started his year in [[Florida]] by winning the [[Swale Stakes]] in the fastest seven furlongs of the [[Gulfstream Park]] meeting in a time of 1:22 1/5 while carrying ten pounds more than the runner up. He "exploded" around the far turn to an almost nine length win defeating [[Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes]] and [[Nassau County Stakes]] winner Tricky Creek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/05/sports/horse-racing-easy-goer-rallies-to-win-the-swale.html |work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Crist | title=HORSE RACING; Easy Goer Rallies To Win The Swale | date=March 5, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then won the one mile [[graded stakes race|Grade II]] [[Gotham Stakes]] by thirteen lengths in stakes and track record time while conceding nine pounds and five pounds to the second and third-place finishers respectively, including future world record holder (on turf at one mile) [[Expensive Decision]], winner of the [[Kelso Handicap]] and [[Saranac Handicap]].  He ran within one to two lengths of the leaders throughout the race, who were running a very rapid pace of 44 1/5 and 1:08 3/5, before running past them and widening away.  He won [[Glossary of North American horse racing#H|handily]] and his winning time of 1:32 2/5 for the mile set a new track record, a second faster than Secretariat's stakes record, the fastest mile on a dirt surface by any three-year-old [[Thoroughbred]] in history, and a fifth of a second off [[Dr. Fager]]'s world record.  Easy Goer's unofficial gallop-out time of 1:45 4/5 for 1 1/8 miles, was 1 1/5 seconds faster than the track record set in 1973 by [[Riva Ridge]], and only two fifths of a second slower than Secretariat's former nine-furlong world record on dirt set in the 1973 [[Marlboro Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/21737/on-this-day |work=Bloodhorse.com | first=Bill | last=Finley |title=On This Day... | date=April 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His next race was the mile and an eighth Grade I [[Wood Memorial]], which in 1989 was run two weeks after the Gotham Stakes and two weeks before the Kentucky Derby. Easy Goer ran close to the lead the entire race and won by three lengths over [[Federico Tesio Stakes]] winner Rock Point. He was timed in a relatively moderate 1:50 3/5. However, students of time pointed out that Aqueduct was playing about two seconds slower than normal on the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-23/sports/sp-1859_1_easy-goer-diamond-donnie-wood-memorial |work=The Los Angeles Times | first=Bill | last=Christine | title=Wood Memorial : Easy Goer's 3-Length Victory Is Impressive but Not Spectacular | date=April 23, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rivalry with Sunday Silence===
Easy Goer was most remembered for his rivalry with Sunday Silence.  The two first met in the [[1989 Kentucky Derby]] where Sunday Silence won by 2½ lengths over Easy Goer in the relatively slow time of 2:05 on a muddy track similar to the Breeders' Cup Juvenile the previous year. Easy Goer had a small crack in his left front heel that was found the week leading into the Kentucky Derby. The crack was serious enough to cause discomfort and possibly keep him from running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&amp;dat=19890518&amp;id=omIhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cIgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1190,4983781 |work=Schenectady Gazette | first=Bill | last=Christine | title=McGaughey decides not to run Easy Goer on bute in Preakness | date=May 18, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Easy Goer had a history for his difficulty to handle a muddy track at Churchill Downs and seemed to be struggling with the footing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/10/sports/belmont-stakes-a-wet-track-could-dampen-bid-for-crown.html|publisher=New York Times|title=BELMONT STAKES; A Wet Track Could Dampen Bid for Crown|date=1989-06-10|accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Day finally steers Easy Goer right"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&amp;dat=19890612&amp;id=N-lRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zm4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6837,3523505|title=Day finally steers Easy Goer right|accessdate=2013-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Easy Goer also had traffic trouble in the race, being cut off by Northern Wolf during the first quarter-mile, causing him to check, and Dansil drifted into his path in the final eighth of a mile in the home stretch, causing Easy Goer to alter course. Multiple Grade I winner Awe Inspiring finished third. Sunday Silence won the Derby despite not keeping a straight path through the stretch while 2½ lengths in front at the finish line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1989-05-07/sports/8901240057_1_easy-goer-santa-anita-derby-115th-kentucky-derby | work=Sun Sentinel | first=Dave | last=Joseph | title=A Moment Of 'Silence' Sunday Silence Upsets Easy Goer In The Mud | date=May 7, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/07/sports/horse-racing-sunday-silence-takes-derby-in-upset.html | work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Crist | title=HORSE RACING; Sunday Silence Takes Derby in Upset | date=May 7, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Derby, both horses returned to action two weeks later in the [[1989 Preakness Stakes]].  Throughout Preakness week, as late as the day before the race, Easy Goer's front feet were being soaked in a tub of [[Epsom salts]] due to small scratches or cracks on both heels. His ankles and knees were also given ultrasound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1989-05-20/sports/8901260263_1_shug-mcgaughey-silence-preakness-stakes | work=Sun Sentinel | first=Dave | last= Joseph |title=Looking For Word To Whys Will Easy Goer Have Answers? | date=May 20, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Easy Goer, after breaking in the air at the start,  made a big, early move down the backstretch which catapulted him to a two-length lead over Sunday Silence with a half mile remaining, with the six-furlong split being run in a rapid 1:09 3/5. Sunday Silence then challenged around the far turn, with both horses running the fastest mile split in Preakness history in 1:34 1/5. Following a nose-to-nose duel for the last quarter mile with Easy Goer running in very tight quarters near the rail, Sunday Silence won by a nose in a fast final time of 1:53 4/5. Jockey [[Pat Day]] was criticized for reining Easy Goer's head sideways to the right in deep stretch with a short lead right before the finish line. Day criticized himself, calling his ride "a mistake."&lt;ref name="Day finally steers Easy Goer right"/&gt;  Bill Christine of the Los Angeles Times, and trainer McGaughey also expressed their opinions on the mistakes they thought Day made during the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-05/sports/sp-1157_1_easy-goer-bill-shoemaker-laffit-pincay|title=It Was a Difference of Styles in the Preakness : Valenzuela's Aggressive Western Riding Overwhelmed Day's Eastern Patience |accessdate=2013-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&amp;dat=19890612&amp;id=N-lRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zm4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6837,3523505|title=Day finally steers Easy Goer right |accessdate=2013-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1345&amp;dat=19890608&amp;id=tFhYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6vkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6754,1321166|title=Easy Goer gets last shot |accessdate=2013-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the race, Day went to McGaughey's barn at Pimlico, after he had been criticized for his ride.

The jockey of Sunday Silence, Pat Valenzuela, described Easy Goer's performance as that of a superhorse.&lt;ref name="Nytimes.com"/&gt;  The race was run over a fast but not unusually quick track.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Easy Goer earned a 122 [[Beyer Speed Figure]], the best in any Triple Crown race since these ratings were first published in 1987.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

===Remainder of season===
Easy Goer went on that year to win the mile and an eighth Grade I [[Whitney Handicap]] at Saratoga, defeating older horses by over four lengths in near record time. The older horses he defeated in this Whitney were: [[Cryptoclearance]], earner of just under $3.4 million and winner of the [[Donn Handicap]], [[Pegasus Stakes]] and [[Widener Handicap]];  [[Brooklyn Handicap]], Nassau County and [[Excelsior Handicap]] winner Forever Silver;  [[Stuyvesant Handicap]], [[Queens County Handicap]] and [[Stymie Handicap]] winner It's Academic; and [[Fayette Handicap]] and [[Ben Ali Handicap]] winner Homebuilder. He missed the stakes and track record in the Whitney by 2/5 of a second.  The record was then held by Tri Jet, the only horse to ever run a faster Whitney than Easy Goer. Easy Goer earned the time even though he steadied while being trapped and boxed in around the far turn, and running his last eighth of a mile in eleven and two-fifth seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/sports/horse-racing-easy-goer-rallies-to-win-whitney.html |work=The New York Times |first=Steven | last=Crist | title=HORSE RACING; Easy Goer Rallies to Win Whitney | date=August 6, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McGaughey said after the race, "I don't know if I've ever seen a horse run the last eighth of a mile that fast going long on the dirt. Sometimes, you see it on the grass when a horse has gone a slow paced mile."&lt;ref name="Jerardi"/&gt;   Two weeks later at Saratoga, he won the $1.08 million mile and a quarter Grade I [[Travers Stakes]] over Grade I [[Arlington Classic]] winner Clever Trevor with moderate effort by three lengths also in near record time. He missed the Travers record by 4/5 of a second. It was the third fastest in Travers history, behind [[General Assembly (horse)|General Assembly]] and [[Honest Pleasure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/20/sports/horse-racing-easy-goer-takes-travers-by-3-lengths.html |work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Crist | title=HORSE RACING; Easy Goer Takes Travers by 3 Lengths | date=August 20, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Trainer [[Jerry Hollendorfer]] decided to skip the Travers with [[Haskell Invitational Stakes]] and [[Hollywood Futurity]] winner King Glorious primarily because, during that era, [[New York (state)|New York]] banned all race-day drugs and medications, and King Glorious had been treated with [[Lasix]] in all nine of his races.  New York didn't allow horses to race on any drugs, while the rest of the country did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-03/sports/sp-586_1_easy-goer |work=Los Angeles Times | first=Bill | last=Christine | title=Horse Racing : King Glorious to Skip Travers, and Easy Goer | date=August 3, 1989 |accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-15/sports/sp-2547_1_shelly-meredith-triple-crown-races | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Bill | last=Christine | title=Horse Racing / Bill Christine : Hawkster Wins the Triple Crown of Mediocrity | date=June 15, 1989 |accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-06/sports/sp-581_1_summer-squall |work=Los Angeles Times | first=Bill | last=Christine | title=Lasix Debate Steals Belmont Spotlight : Horse racing: New York prohibits use of the diuretic to treat horses, in effect keeping bleeders such as Summer Squall away | date=June 6, 1990 |accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The trainer of Sunday Silence, [[Charlie Whittingham]], may have chose to skip the Travers because he was angered that the controversial veterinarian Alex Harthill, who treated Sunday Silence earlier in the year, was not licensed in New York and prohibited from practicing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1989/06/11/new-york-still-bars-harthill/86b9ba1a-24c1-4f6a-9d26-99597e371d03/ | work=Washington Post | first=Vinnie | last=Perrone | title=NEW YORK STILL BARS HARTHILL  | date=June 11, 1989 |accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/09/sports/belmont-stakes-the-big-two-will-go-head-to-head-at-the-start.html |work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Crist | title=BELMONT STAKES; The Big Two Will Go Head to Head at the Start | date=June 9, 1989 |accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also may have chose to skip the Travers to rest the horse, as he didn't run Sunday Silence in any race during that month of August.  Easy Goer then won the $809,000 mile and a quarter Grade I [[Woodward Stakes]] by two lengths on a muddy track, again defeating older horses while carrying more weight and being stuck in traffic, boxed in on the rail and checking hard twice. Easy Goer's victory seemingly squashed the perception that muddy or wet tracks were his Achilles' heel.  Day said after the race, "Mud is different everywhere."  The older horses he defeated in this Woodward were: [[Metropolitan Handicap]], [[Arkansas Derby]] and [[Philip H. Iselin Stakes]] winner Proper Reality; and [[Oaklawn Handicap]] and [[Gulfstream Park Handicap]] winner Slew City Slew. This was the final time the Woodward was run at the mile and a quarter distance before being permanently shortened in distance to a mile and an eighth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/17/sports/horse-racing-easy-goer-proves-he-s-no-1.html |work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Crist | title=HORSE RACING; Easy Goer Proves He's No. 1 | date=September 17, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, he won the $1.09 million mile and a half Grade I [[Jockey Club Gold Cup]] by four lengths, again defeating older horses, included among them were the aforementioned Cryptoclearance, who finished second. He also defeated [[Breeders' Cup Turf]] and [[Molson Export Million]] winner [[Prized]] by over 20 lengths in this race, a horse who had defeated Sunday Silence earlier in the year in the Grade II [[Swaps Stakes]].  The track was playing dull and slow, but despite the dullness of the racing surface, moderate pace, and relatively slow final time, he ran his sixth and final quarter-mile his fastest, coming home in 24.12 seconds. This was the final time the Jockey Club Gold Cup was run at the mile and a half distance prior to being permanently shortened in distance to a mile and a quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/08/sports/horse-racing-easy-goer-surges-to-win-gold-cup.html |work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Crist | title=HORSE RACING; Easy Goer Surges To Win Gold Cup | date=October 8, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rivalry with Sunday Silence concluded in the [[Breeders' Cup Classic]], run on November 4 at 1¼ miles.  With champion honors at stake, the race was labeled "Race of the Decade" by the horse racing media.  Easy Goer was favored by the wagering public based on his Belmont Stakes win and four subsequent Grade I wins, three against older horses. Sunday Silence's regular rider, [[Patrick Valenzuela]], had recently been suspended for cocaine use.  Trainer [[Charles E. Whittingham]] assigned the mount to [[Chris McCarron]]. Easy Goer came into the 10-furlong Classic off the 12-furlong Gold Cup—a potentially tricky parlay for a trainer, because the longer race can have the dangerous effect of dulling the colt's natural speed and blunting the quickness that he might need in a shorter race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1989/11/13/120995/silence-roars-once-more-in-the-race-for-horse-of-the-year-sunday-silence-outran-easy-goer-in-the-breeders-cup-classic | work=Sports Illustrated | first=William | last=Nack | title=Silence Roars Once More | date=November 13, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, trainer Charlie Whittingham had run Sunday Silence only twice in the five months since the Belmont, both times over a 1¼-mile distance—in the Grade II [[Swaps Stakes]] at [[Hollywood Park Racetrack|Hollywood Park]], where he finished second, and two months later in the Sept. 24 [[Super Derby]] at [[Louisiana Downs]], which he won. Easy Goer ran 11 lengths off the lead, about seven lengths behind Sunday Silence, behind the brisk opening fractions of 22:2/5 and 46:1/5, but made a big run down the backstretch and got near his rival at the half-mile point.  Sunday Silence then made a charge turning for home and gained the lead in the final furlong, four lengths ahead of Easy Goer.  Easy Goer closed ground late with another big move but lost by a diminishing neck to Sunday Silence, who was under strong urging by McCarron, with a final time of 2:00 1/5.   [[Blushing John]], the [[American Champion Older Dirt Male Horse]] that year, finished behind the top two in third.  The victory assured Sunday Silence [[Eclipse Award for Outstanding Three-Year-Old Male Horse]] and Horse of the Year honors for 1989. After the race, McGaughey said, "Sunday Silence had a perfect trip and we made a couple of mistakes. Pat and I agree that he made riding mistakes in the Preakness. But in the other races, there were circumstances that contributed to what happened. Maybe when Pat grabbed him after the start, the horse didn't understand what he was doing. Then Pat was content to sit and wait behind Sunday Silence, as he had done before, and the other horse got away from us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-11-06/sports/sp-723_1_easy-goer | work=The Los Angeles Times | first=Bill | last=Christine | title=Sounds of Silence Make It Difficult for McGaughey : Horse Racing: The day after losing the Breeders' Cup Classic to Sunday Silence, Easy Goer's trainer is feeling blue. | date=November 6, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In my heart, I think Easy Goer is the better horse;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1989-11-05/sports/8902080519_1_easy-goer-shug-mcgaughey-breeders |title=Losing The Big One Never Easy For Mcgaughey |publisher=Sun-sentinel.com |date=1989-11-05 |accessdate=July 15, 2016 |first=Michael |last=Mayo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  I think anybody would say that if those two ran against each other ten times, each would probably win five."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1992-10-28/sports/9202260210_1_easy-goer-shug-mcgaughey-breeders-cup |title='89 Race Haunts Trainer Sunday Silence Still Casts Shadow |publisher=Sun-sentinel.com |date=October 28, 1992 |accessdate=July 15, 2016 |first=Chris |last=Lazzarino}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Day said his ride wasn't the best,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1989-11-05/sports/8902080519_1_easy-goer-shug-mcgaughey-breeders |title=Losing The Big One Never Easy For Mcgaughey |publisher=Sun-sentinel.com |date=1989-11-05 |accessdate=2016-02-14 |first=Michael |last=Mayo}}&lt;/ref&gt; while also stating, "I've said it before, I think Easy Goer was better than Sunday Silence, despite his three to one edge in the head to head races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-27/sports/sp-737_1_easy-goer | work=The Los Angeles Times | first=Jay | last=Hovdey | title=For That Happy Traveler Sunday Silence, Getting There Is More Than Half the Fun | date=July 27, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  I'll go to my grave believing that.

In Easy Goer's best race, he walloped Sunday Silence by eight lengths in the Belmont. In a few of his close defeats, Easy Goer had legitimate excuses: he lost the Derby on a muddy track he had difficulty handling, and lost the Preakness by only a nose after a dubious ride. In the Classic, where Sunday Silence held him off by a neck, Easy Goer just missed, but left no one thinking it could not have gone the other way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/24/sports/on-horse-racing-closing-the-chapter-on-easy-goer.html?scp=6&amp;sq=easy%20goer%20secretariat&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Crist | title=ON HORSE RACING; Closing the Chapter on Easy Goer | date=July 24, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Daily Racing Form's Mike Watchmaker concurred, stating, "To this day, you won't have any trouble finding people who believe that Easy Goer was a better racehorse than Sunday Silence.

Sunday Silence is Horse of the Year despite never having won at a mile and a half (the classic distance for most of the world) and never having given weight while defeating older horses, as Easy Goer did in three races.

Prior to 1971 the American Champion Older Male Horse award was referred to as "Champion Handicap Male Horse."  The ''Daily Racing Form'' version was open to any horse ages three years old and up, and this award was given to some champions at the age of three, such as [[Citation (horse)|Citation]], [[Buckpasser]], [[Sword Dancer]], [[Damascus (horse)|Damascus]] and [[Arts and Letters]].  The three-year-old Easy Goer conceded weight on scale while defeating top older horses in both the Whitney (G1) and Woodward (G1) Handicaps; defeated leading older horses a third time in the weight-for-age Jockey Club Gold Cup (G1); and beat older horses again in the weight-for-age Breeders' Cup Classic (G1), including the future Champion Older Male Blushing John. Had the awards been categorized as they were prior to 1971, Easy Goer most likely would have been named Champion Handicap Male Horse of 1989.&lt;ref name="jockeysite.com"/&gt;

===1990: four-year-old season===
At four, Easy Goer won the seven-furlong Gold Stage Stakes easily on a sloppy track by over seven lengths, defeating [[Phoenix Stakes (United States)|Phoenix Stakes]] winner Hadif in a final time of 1:22 1/5.  Twelve days later, he was third in the Grade I [[Metropolitan Mile]], marking the only time he did not finish either first or second in his career. Easy Goer always had problematic [[fetlock|ankles]], and his handlers had to work overtime on them during the month. Rumors about his soundness had swirled around the track for the two weeks leading into the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/29/sports/criminal-type-outruns-housebuster-and-easy-goer-at-belmont.html |work=The New York Times |first=Steven | last=Crist | title=Criminal Type Outruns Housebuster and Easy Goer at Belmont | date=May 29, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Easy Goer was beaten by a little more than a length  behind eventual Horse of the Year [[Criminal Type]] and two-time sprint champion [[Housebuster]] while carrying considerably more weight than those competitors (fourteen and seven pounds, respectively). Future Horse of the Year and Breeders' Cup Classic winner [[Black Tie Affair]] and two-time [[Vosburgh Handicap]] winner Sewickley finished behind the top three.  He then won the mile and a quarter Grade I [[Suburban Handicap]] by almost four lengths [[Glossary of North American horse racing#R|ridden out]] in a time of 2:00 after going head and head on the lead while sprinting through fast fractions of 46.75 for a half-mile and 1:09.87 for six furlongs. He defeated [[Jerome Handicap]] winner De Roche, as well as [[Brooklyn Handicap]] and Stuyvesant Handicap winner Montubio. The final time was 3/5 of a second off [[Alysheba]]'s then track record, which had been set in a weight for age race. Easy Goer conceded {{convert|12|to|19|lb}} to his opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/05/sports/an-aggressive-easy-goer-wins-suburban.html |work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Crist | title=An Aggressive Easy Goer Wins Suburban | date=July 5, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Easy Goer's 20-race career, he was never defeated by more than 2½ lengths.

After his Suburban Handicap win, Easy Goer was retired due to a bone chip in his right front ankle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/19/sports/easy-goer-is-retired-after-bone-chip-is-found.html | work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Crist | title=Easy Goer Is Retired After Bone Chip Is Found | date=July 19, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won 14 races, including 9 Grade I wins, and earned $4,873,770.

==Stud record==
After his retirement from racing, Easy Goer stood stud at [[Claiborne Farm]] in Paris, Kentucky. He was given the honor of occupying the number one stall in the number one barn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.philly.com/1994-06-24/sports/25831272_1_fourstars-allstar-easy-goer-race-track | work=The Inquirer | first=Dick | last=Jerardi | title=Reserved For Racing Legends Only Lure Could Earn Claiborne's Coveted Stall | date=June 24, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; His stall was previously occupied by [[Bold Ruler]] and Secretariat. At age eight, in 1994, Easy Goer collapsed and died while jogging in his paddock at Claiborne Farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lazzarino|first=Chris|title=Easy Goer Collapses, Dies|newspaper=Sun Sentinel|date=May 13, 1994|url= http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-05-13/sports/9405120793_1_easy-goer-trainer-shug-mcgaughey-stakes|accessdate=May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Thomas Swerczek, the veterinary pathologist at the [[University of Kentucky]], who conducted Easy Goer's [[necropsy]], determined the horse died of an [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic]] reaction to an undetermined allergen and also had cancerous tumors in multiple organs.  The veterinarians were convinced the cancer did not kill Easy Goer and probably would not have been fatal for a long time. They also said fatal allergic reactions are more common than most professionals realize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lazzarino|first=Chris|title=Gambler keeps placing big bets, but he won't show|newspaper=Sun Sentinel|date=May 29, 1994|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-05-29/sports/9405280385_1_easy-goer-show-bets-las-vegas|accessdate=May 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Easy Goer was buried at Claiborne Farm along with Secretariat, [[Buckpasser]], [[Bold Ruler]] and many other greats.

At stud, in just a few crops before his premature death, Easy Goer sired three Grade I winners and nine stakes winners (7%), from 136 foals, of which 101 were starters, and 74 were winners. While speed at distances up to a mile had been favored over "stoutness" in much American breeding, Easy Goer demonstrated speed over a mile as well as stamina. Given the combination of his pedigree and the high-quality mares to which he was bred at Claiborne, it was speculated by ''[[The Blood-Horse]]'' that he would have been even more significant as a stallion had he lived longer.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt; Easy Goer has also been an influential broodmare sire. From 53 mares sired by Easy Goer, they have produced 23 stakes winners.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;

==Honors and Assessments==
In 1997, Easy Goer was inducted into the [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.racingmuseum.org/hall-of-fame/easy-goer |work=racingmuseum.org/hall-of-fame |title=Easy Goer| date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Blood-Horse magazine]] ranking of the [[Blood-Horse magazine List of Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century|top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century]], Easy Goer was ranked # 34.  Easy Goer won the Eclipse Award as American champion 2-year-old male in 1988.  Easy Goer graces the cover of the 2005 book, "Belmont Park: A Century of Champions,"  with paintings by Richard Stone Reeves and text by Edward L. Bowen.  Belmont Park, the renowned racetrack, has played host to some of Thoroughbred racing's greatest champions, from [[Man o' War]] and [[Citation (horse)|Citation]] to Secretariat and [[Cigar (horse)|Cigar]].  Belmont Park is known as "The Championship Track" because nearly every major American champion in racing history has competed on the racetrack.  The book chronicles seventy racehorses who competed from 1905 to 2005 thrilling fans, setting records, and becoming legends at the venerable New York track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LhVVOWZ5QR0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  |title=Belmont Park: A Century of Champions  |publisher=Eclipse Press Blood-Horse publications  |author=Edward L. Bowen and Richard Stone Reeves  |accessdate=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Easy Goer's rivalry with Sunday Silence was featured as the 17th chapter of Horse Racing's Greatest Rivalries (2008, Eclipse Press), a compilation produced by the staff of The Blood-Horse.  Easy Goer's duel with Sunday Silence in the 1989 Preakness was ranked #70 in Horse Racing's Top 100 Moments, a review of racing in the 20th century compiled by The Blood-Horse and released in 2006.  Easy Goer was retrospectively awarded a [[Timeform]] rating of 137 pounds which was tied with his arch-rival Sunday Silence for second place among American runners of the 20th century. Only Cigar at 138 pounds was rated higher.&lt;ref name="Easy Goer USA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanclassicpedigrees.com/easy-goer.html   |location=americanclassicpedigrees.com  |title=Easy Goer (USA) |date=2014–2016 |accessdate=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Easy Goer was one of thirty champion Thoroughbreds inducted into the Saratoga Hoofprints Walk of Fame as part of the inaugural class in 2013.

'''Enrique Sarasola Lerchundi''' (24 August 1937 – 2 November 2002) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[business magnate|industrialist]], a major figure in his country's transition to [[democracy]],{{cn|date=October 2015}} and an owner and [[horse breeding|breeder]] of [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|racehorses]].
 
A native of [[Donostia|San Sebastian]], [[Spain]], at age twenty, Sarasola emigrated to [[Colombia]] as an [[audit|auditor]] with [[Price Waterhouse]]. He married Cecilia Marulanda, from a wealthy family, and eventually went into business for himself. Highly successful, in 1970 he returned to his native Spain where he became active in politics. Working behind the scenes where political opposition was suppressed by the government of [[General Franco]], Sarasola used his wealth to help the then illegal [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) headed by [[Felipe Gonzalez]]. After Gonzalez was elected [[Prime Ministers of the Spanish government|Prime Minister of the Spanish government]] in 1982, Enrique Sarasola became a powerful figure during Gonzalez' fourteen years in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.transicionestructural.net/index.php?topic=709.0 La Gran Cloaca (II).

Enrique Sarasola owned a number of successful racehorses, the best known of which was [[Helissio]], winner of the 1996 [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]] and [[Cartier Racing Award|European Horse of the Year]]. From 1992 until its closure in 1996, Sarasola was the owner of Hipodromo de la Zarzuela [[race track]], just west of Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jockeysroom.com/msg20.htm La Zarzuela Racetrack, Spain]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{es}} {{cite web|url=http://actualidad.orange.es/nacional/herederos-sarasola-tendran-que-pagar-34-millones-al-grupo-torras.html|title=Los herederos de Enrique Sarasola Lerchundi tendrán que pagar 34 millones al Grupo Torras noticias Nacional actualidad|accessdate=2 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602183452/http://actualidad.orange.es/nacional/herederos-sarasola-tendran-que-pagar-34-millones-al-grupo-torras.html|archive-date=2 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3727">An '''entrepreneurial company with limited liability''' (in German: Unternehmergesellschaft (haftungsbeschränkt)) is a [[Germany|German]] form of a [[private limited company]], usually established as an alternative to a [[Aktiengesellschaft|German corporation]] or [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]] (limited liability) entity. Companies organized as an entrepreneurial company have the suffix ‘''UG (haftungsbeschränkt)''’ appended to their names.

== Background ==
The German government introduced the UG primarily to act as an alternative to establishing a traditional corporation.&lt;ref&gt;BGH, Urteil vom 27. September 1999 - II ZR 371/98&lt;/ref&gt; A UG established under German law is not a new type of [[Legal personality|legal entity]]; rather, it is a limited liability company similar to a GmbH, with the exception that, unlike the GmbH, it is not required to meet the legally mandated €25,000 share capital required of a GmbH—a UG can be established with as little as one euro of paid-in capital. However, a UG is still a separate legal entity from its owners and is fully liable for paying [[Income tax|corporation taxes]] and publishing annual [[financial statement]]s. UG entities can be recognized as not-for-profit, under the right conditions.

The UG form has been met with great interest, especially by [[Startup company|start-up companies]] and other entrepreneurs. As of January 1, 2012, there had been 64,371 of such companies formed. Since then, traditional corporations have been reduced in importance, having largely been supplanted by the UG (and also the GmbH) among new companies being formed.&lt;ref&gt;''Kornblum:'' In: ''GmbH-Rundschau.'' 2012, S. 728.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation and requirements ==
Forming a UG is relatively similar to forming a closely related GmbH entity, however the UG is exempt from some of the capital rules applicable to a GmbH.

=== Company name ===
The company must bear the title “Unternehmergesellschaft (haftungsbeschränkt)” or, as an abbreviated form, “UG (haftungsbeschränkt)” (§ 5a GmbHG). ''Unternehmergesellschaft'' means entrepreneurial company and the German word ''haftungsbeschränkt'' means “limited liability”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streifflaw.de''Streiff:'' Starting a business in Germany], Berlin 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It signifies the fact that the owners of the company have limited liability for the company’s debts.

=== Share capital ===
The nominal amount of the business’ shares - the so-called "[[Share capital|ordinary capital]]" - as defined in the [[Partnership agreement|company agreement]], must be provided after the foundation of the company and before its registration into the commercial register ( [https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&amp;depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;prev=_t&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=auto&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gmbhg/__5a.html&amp;usg=ALkJrhhmTYUQ3Nd6ktVNVnZqC8u4zo0Tcw § 5a] para 2 GmbHG). The total capital stock must be at least one euro. In practice, amounts of up to €1,000 are usually chosen.

If the total amount of share capital exceeds EUR 25,000, then a GmbH is usually formed instead of a UG. (§ 5a para. 1 p.&amp;nbsp;1 GmbHG). In contrast to the GmbH form, no contribution in kind is permitted for a UG. The share capital must be paid immediately in full as a cash contribution (§ 5a (2) GmbHG). If capital of EUR 12,500 is available, either a UG (limited liability) with a share capital of EUR 12,500 can be established, or a limited liability company in the original sense, in which only half of the share capital of at least EUR 25,000 has to be paid.

'''Evzen Korec''' (born September 16, 1956) is a Czech scientist and businessman, owner of the property developer [[EKOSPOL]] and owner and director of [[Tabor Zoo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://budejovice.idnes.cz/evzen-korec-koupi-zoo-v-tabore-deo-/budejovice-zpravy.aspx?c=A150421_2157045_budejovice-zpravy_jkr Businessman Korec bought Tabor zoo]&lt;/ref&gt; He is the co-author of 11 patents and more than 20 research articles published in international scientific journals. Korec has also written four books, one of which (''Co je v domě, není pro mě!'') became a bestseller shortly after publication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denik.cz/trendy/touzite-investovat-do-nemovitosti-ne-otevrit-oci-by-vam-mohla-nova-kniha-2014060.html Unique book about investing in real estates]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and scientific career ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
Korec graduated from the Faculty of Science, [[Charles University]] in 1981, in Molecular Biology and Genetics. His Master's thesis was an Analysis of Susceptibility and Resistance to Rous Sarcoma Virus in Inbred Line of Minor Poultry. Between 1983 and 1986 he worked as a researcher at the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the [[Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences]], where he received a PhD in [[Oncology]], with a doctoral thesis on the Expression and Detection of Virus Proteins of Tumor Viruses.

After 1986, Korec completed long-term research fellowships at universities across Europe, including the [[University of Göttingen]] in Germany, and universities in London and Paris. He was the co-author of 11 patents in the field of Molecular Biology and Genetics. In this field he published more than 20 research articles in international scientific journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=korec+e|title=korec e - PubMed - NCBI|last=pubmeddev|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
In 1992 he founded the development company EKOSPOL, and has served as its CEO and chairman since then. EKOSPOL is one of the two largest residential developers in the Czech Republic,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hypoindex.cz/developersky-trh-v-praze-miri-k-triumviratu-koncentrace-trhu-bude-pokracovat/ Development market in Prague is heading to the triumvirate, market concentration will continue]&lt;/ref&gt; according to market share of apartment sales, and has also been listed among the 50 leading residential developers in Central and Eastern Europe by a trade magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grupa-eco.pl/images/pdf/20120401_CIJ_TOP_50_SIN_67632462.pdf 50 leading residential developers in Central and Eastern Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

Korec lectures regularly at the [[University of Economics, Prague|University of Economics in Prague]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vse.cz/zpravodaj/846 Report on the conference - Factors prosperity of enterprises in the local and global environment 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; and frequently comments on residential development, construction, housing market and the mortgage market in Czech media. Between 2010 and 2016 he was the most frequently quoted public figure in the Czech development industry, and EKOSPOL was the most frequently mentioned development company in the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stavebni-forum.cz/cs/article/23735/developeri-v-mediich-evzen-korec-a-ekospol-posilili-sve-pozice/ Czech developers in media: Evžen Korec and EKOSPOL have strengthened positions]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Korec received the Top Manager of the Sector of Real Estate Development and Construction Award in the Manager of the Year 2012 Awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buildingnews.cz/zpravy-dne/evzen-korec-je-manazerem-roku-v-odvetvi-vystavby-a-developmentu.html TOP Manager of the Sector of Real Estate Development and Construction]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Korec's rule ===
As the owner of Ekospol development company, Korec formulated Korec's rule, which says: 
''"The final sales price of an apartment with the area of up to 50 m2 must correspond to a maximum of 20 times the annual rent in a given location. For larger apartments (large one bedroom apartment, two bedroom apartment etc.) the sales price should be on the level of a maximum of 25 to 30 times the annual rent."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/965748296|title=Finanční gramotnost|last=Miroslav.|first=Škvára,|isbn=9788090482333|edition=Druhé vydání|location=Praha|oclc=965748296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korec's rule helps a person interested in buying an apartment to relatively precisely determine the maximum sales price of an apartment in a given location. This rule applies generally, independent of the location. The rent price already reflects the attractiveness of the location, and the current rent price of a given location can be easily found on real estate websites.

== Animal protection ==
Korec is also active in the field of animal protection and preservation. In 2015, Korec rescued [[Tabor Zoo]] from liquidation, buying the zoo from an insolvency administrator. The zoo was re-opened to the public later that year, focused on the preservation of endangered species. Korec is himself a breeder of various animals, including [[Koi|koi carp]] and horses. He is the owner of Korec Corso kennel, home to the most successful bitch of the [[Cane Corso]] dog breed in the Czech Republic in 2015, Koleta Atison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreccorso.cz/en/about-us/|title=About us {{!}} Korec Corso - Chovatelská stanice Cane Corso Italiano|website=www.koreccorso.cz|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his company EKOSPOL, Korec supports the civic association Společnost pro zvířata ("Society for Animals") and charitable trust Česká Krajina, as well as sponsoring Tabor Zoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spolecnostprozvirata.cz/podporili-nas/|title=Podpořili nás {{!}} SPOLEČNOST PRO ZVÍŘATA ZO ČSOP|website=spolecnostprozvirata.cz|language=cs-CZ|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Korec also supports the animal rights campaign "Konec doby klecové" ("End of the Cage Era") organized by Společnost pro zvířata, with the goal of ending the cage farming of poultry and all other animal species in the Czech Republic,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spolecnostprozvirata.cz/konecdobyklecove/|title=KONEC DOBY KLECOVÉ {{!}} SPOLEČNOST PRO ZVÍŘATA ZO ČSOP|website=spolecnostprozvirata.cz|language=cs-CZ|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Česká krajina's biodiversity protection projects focused on the reintroduction of native Czech animal species, such as wild horses, European bisons or aurochs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zootabor.eu/en/zoo-tabor-returns-european-bison-to-the-czech-nature/|title=ZOO Tábor Returns European Bison to the Czech Nature {{!}} ZOO Tábor|last=Tábor|first=Zoo|website=www.zootabor.eu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korec leads a scientific group in Tabor Zoo, which determined for the first time the average lifespan of Cane Corso dogs through a study of a statistically significant group in cooperation with 72 Cane Corso kennels from 25 countries. The research aims to extend the life of Cane Corso dogs. In this publication, the relationship between average lifespan and hair colour was described in mammals for the first time. The research results were published in the ''[[Open Veterinary Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Veterinary Journal|url=http://www.openveterinaryjournal.com/2017/Volume%207%20No%202/OVJ-2017-02-036%20E.%20Korec%20et%20al.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korec is a member of the Editorial Board of the US veterinary journal ''Approaches in Poultry, Dairy &amp; Veterinary Sciences''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Approaches in Poultry, Dairy &amp; Veterinary Sciences|url=http://crimsonpublishers.us/apdv/editorial-board.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Korec is married to Jana, and they have one son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hn.ihned.cz/c1-57101760-relaxace-u-kapru-koi Relaxing with koi carps]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federal Reserve Bank of New York Building''' at '''33 Liberty Street''', which occupies the full block between [[Liberty Street (Manhattan)|Liberty]], [[William Street (Manhattan)|William]] and [[Nassau Street (Manhattan)|Nassau]] Streets and [[Maiden Lane (Manhattan)|Maiden Lane]] in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], is the headquarters of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]]. It is where the [[monetary policy of the United States]] is executed by trading [[dollars]] and [[United States Treasury security|United States Treasury securities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/whatwedo.html "What We Do"]
[[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The building also hosts a vault containing the world's largest depository of gold, stored on behalf of numerous government institutions from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/goldvault.html|title=Gold Vault|accessdate=2016-08-16|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total holdings in 2015 amounted to approximately 6,350 tons of gold. Relatively little of this gold belongs to the United States Government; as of August 2016, the building's vault holds {{convert|13400000|ozt|ST}} of gold bullion and $3 million (book value) in gold coins for the United States, a little more than 5% of the United States' total gold reserve.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/rpt/goldRpt/current_report.htm "Status Report of U.S. Government Gold Reserves"] [[Bureau of the Fiscal Service]], [[United States Department of the Treasury]] (September 30, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was designated a landmark by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neighborhoodpreservationcenter.org/db/bb_files/FED-RESERVE-BANK-ORIG.pdf "Feberal Reserve Bank of New York Designation Report"] [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] (December 21, 1965)&lt;/ref&gt; and was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.

==Building and architecture==
[[File:2013 Federal Reserve Bank of New York from William Street top.jpg|thumb|left|325px|The top of the building seen from Maiden Lane]]

The visual impact of the [[neo-Renaissance]] structure derives from its monumental size, fortress-like appearance, fine proportions and the overall quality of construction. It set the precedent for many later banks which were greatly influenced by its design.&lt;ref name=landmarks /&gt;

Built from 1919 through 1924, with an extension to the east built in 1935, all designed by [[York and Sawyer]] with decorative ironwork by [[Samuel Yellin]] of Philadelphia,&lt;ref name=aia&gt;{{cite aia5}}, p.38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nycland&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p.13–14&lt;/ref&gt; this massive building occupies an entire city block, reaching fourteen stories tall with five additional floors underground.&lt;ref name=landmarks&gt;{{cite landmarks}} p.548&lt;/ref&gt; The building tapers to become very narrow at its east end, following the footprint of the block it stands on.&lt;ref name=landmarks /&gt;

The stone exterior of the building is reminiscent of an early [[Italian Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]] [[palace]], such as [[Florence]]'s [[Palazzo Strozzi]] and [[Palazzo Vecchio]],&lt;ref name=landmarks /&gt; a deliberate choice so as to inspire trust and confidence in the institution within. The horizontal and vertical joints of the facade's stones  are deeply grooved or [[rustication (architecture)|rusticated]].  Other features include lanterns and window grills constructed of [[wrought iron]].&lt;ref name=landmarks /&gt;{{clear left}}

==Vault==
The vault rests on Manhattan's [[bedrock]], {{convert|80|ft}} below street level and {{convert|50|ft}} below sea level. The weight of the vault and the gold inside would exceed the weight limits of almost any other foundation.&lt;ref name="fed2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/goldvault.html|title=Gold Vault|publisher=[[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]]|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1927, the vault contained 10% of the world's [[official gold reserves]].&lt;ref name="FRB04"&gt;[http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/history_article.html "History"]. [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]]. Retrieved 2010-03-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it is reputedly the largest [[gold]] repository in the world  and holds approximately {{convert|7,000|t|ST|lk=on}} of gold bullion ($415 billion as of October 2011), more than [[United States Bullion Depository|Fort Knox]]. Nearly 98% of the gold at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is owned by the central banks of 36 foreign nations.&lt;ref&gt;''Mightiest Bank''. Aired on Monday, 14 November 2011, 7:00pm–8:00pm EST on [[Planet Green]]. 51 minutes.

Princeton, NJ: Films for the Humanities &amp; Sciences. 2000. Originally produced for the Discovery Channel by Powderhouse Productions. Retrieved 14 November 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The rest is owned by the United States and international organizations such as the [[IMF]]. The Federal Reserve Bank does not own the gold but serves as guardian of the precious metal, which it stores at no charge to the owners, but charging a $1.75 fee (in 2008) per bar to move the gold. There are elaborate procedures for the handling of the gold, with three different teams monitoring every transaction. Moving the bars requires [[Steel-toe boot|steel-toe footware]] for the staff, to protect their feet in case they drop one of the gold bars weighing {{convert|28|lb|kg|lk=on}}. The vault is open to tourists.&lt;ref&gt;Mayerowitz, Scott.

==Legal Problems &amp; Acquittal==

In March 2011, The Tel Aviv Magistrate’s Court acquitted Gad Ze’evi and three other executives from Malam of charges of fraud.

The trial against Ze’evi lasted five years and included dozens of court hearings. Ze’evi who was chairman of IT giant Malam Systems was indicted in 2006 of committing stock fraud in order to increase his monthly salary.  In her closing remarks, as published in both the [http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=211138 Jerusalem Post] &amp; [http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000628308&amp;fid=1725 Globes] daily newspapers, Judge Daniela Cherizli criticized the local Israeli district attorneys office for drawing out the trial unnecessarily.

"I am not going into personal issues. I kept the verdict professional and objective, even though I strongly wanted to say what I thought during the hearing. Things could have been much shorter," Judge Cherizli told the prosecutors. "I did not halt the hearing only out of the respect that I have for the prosecution. It was really irrelevant."

Judge Cherizli added that the legal material was clear, and so was the required verdict. "At the end of the day, everything focused on the issue of the shares. I made no normative statement whether the shares were tainted or not, but I think that act by the accused was neither false nor unreasonable. I thoroughly examined all the material. In general, I think that Mr. Tiber did not err according to the specific material in this case."  Judge Cherizli also criticized the Israel Securities Authority for not providing an opinion on the case. "I would have expected the Securities Authority to express an opinion, but it did not do so, so what I am expected to do? The grounds for a charge of fraudulent receiving have been undercut. More than necessary, I discussed the question whether there were misleading details in the various documents. There was no conspiracy, and I therefore acquit the accused of all charges in the indictment."

==Philanthropy==

Gad Zeevi regularly donates to local and international art museums, schools, health and education and in Jan 2011 he personally donated 200,000 NIS in vehicles and parts to Elem, a Haifa-based charity organization which focuses on assisting needy children with food, clothing, education and social activities.

{{Democracy}}
{{Template:Social democracy sidebar|ideas}}

'''Industrial democracy''' is an arrangement which involves workers making decisions, sharing responsibility and [[authority]] in the workplace. While in [[participative management]] [[organizational design]]s workers are listened to and take part in the [[decision-making]] process, in organizations employing industrial democracy they also have the final decisive power (they decide about organizational design and [[hierarchy]] as well).&lt;ref name="shopfloor democracy"&gt;{{cite book | title=Shop Floor Democracy in Action | publisher=Russell Press | author=Rayton, D. | year=1972 | location=Nottingham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In company law, the term generally used is [[co-determination]], following the German word ''Mitbestimmung''. In Germany, companies with more than 2000 employees (or more than 1000 employees in the coal and steel industries) have half of their supervisory boards of directors (which elect management) elected by the shareholders and half by the workers.

Although industrial democracy generally refers to the organization model in which workplaces are run directly by the people who work in them in place of [[Private sector|private]] or [[state ownership]] of the [[means of production]], there are also representative forms of industrial democracy. Representative industrial democracy includes decision-making structures such as the formation of [[committees]] and consultative bodies to facilitate communication between [[management]], [[trade union|unions]], and [[Employee|staff]].

== Rationale ==
Advocates often point out that industrial democracy increases [[productivity]] and service delivery from a more fully engaged and [[happiness|happier]] [[workforce]]{{Citation needed|reason=Assertion without any supporting sources|date=July 2017}}.  Other benefits include less industrial dispute resulting from better communication in the workplace; improved and inclusive decision-making processes resulting in qualitatively better workplace decisions, decreased stress and increased well-being, an increase in [[job satisfaction]], a reduction in [[absenteeism]] and an improved sense of fulfillment{{Citation needed|reason=Multiple assertions without any supporting material|date=July 2017}}. Other authors regard industrial democracy as a consequence of citizenship rights{{Citation needed|reason=Weasel word, Which authors?|date=July 2017}}.

== Works councils and workers' participation ==

{{Main|Works council}}
At the point of production, the introduction of mandatory works councils and voluntary schemes of workers' participation (e.g. semi-autonomous groups) have a long tradition in European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Rogers/Wolfgang Streeck (eds.): ''Works Councils. Consultation, Representation, and Cooperation in Industrial Relations'', The University of Chicago Press, Chicago-London 1995. - Thomas Sandberg; 'Work Organization and Autonomous Groups'', LiberFörlag, Uppsala 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Co-determination ==

{{Main|Co-determination}}
In a number of European countries, employees of a business take part in election of company directors. In Germany, the law is known as the ''[[Mitbestimmungsgesetz]] of 1976''. In Britain a 1977 proposal for a similar system was named the [[Bullock Report]].

== History ==
{{Libertarian socialism |Economics}}
The [[Anarchism|anarchist]] thinker [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] used the term "industrial democracy" in the 1850s to describe the vision of workplace democracy he had first raised in the 1840s with ''[[What Is Property?|What is Property? Or, an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government]]'', (management "must be chosen from the workers by the workers themselves, and must fulfil the conditions of eligibility.") He repeated this call in later works like ''General Idea of the Revolution.''&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.property-is-theft.org/ Property is Theft! A Pierre-Joseph Proudhon Anthology]''. Edinburgh/Oakland: AK Press. p. 610, p. 119, pp. 586-7&lt;/ref&gt;

In late nineteenth century, and at the beginning of the twentieth century, industrial democracy, along with [[anarcho-syndicalism]] and [[new unionism]], represented one of the dominant themes in [[revolutionary socialism]] and played a prominent role in international [[labour movement]]s. The term industrial democracy was also used by British socialist reformers [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]] in their 1897 book ''[[Industrial Democracy]]''. The Webbs used the term to refer to trade unions and the process of [[collective bargaining]].&lt;ref name="ID"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Müller-Jentsch|first=Walther|title=Industrial Democracy: Historical Development and Current Challenges|journal=Management Revue|date=December 16, 2007|volume=19 | issue = 4 |pages=260–273|url=http://www.management-revue.org/papers/mrev_4_08_Mueller-Jentsch.pdf|accessdate=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the influence of the movements promoting industrial democracy declined after the defeat of the anarchists in the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] in 1939, several unions and organizations advocating the arrangement continue to exist and are again on the rise internationally.

The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] advance an [[industrial unionism]] which would organize all the workers, regardless of skill, gender or race, into [[One Big Union (concept)|one big union]] divided into a series of departments corresponding to different industries.  The industrial unions would be the embryonic form of future [[post-capitalist]] production.  Once sufficiently organized, the industrial unions would overthrow capitalism by means of a [[general strike]], and carry on production through worker run enterprises without bosses or the wage system.  [[Anarcho-syndicalism|Anarcho-syndicalist]] unions, like the ''[[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]]'', are similar in their means and ends but organize workers into geographically based and federated syndicates rather than industrial unions.

The New Unionism Network also promotes [[workplace democracy]] as a means to linking production and [[economic democracy]].

== Representative industrial democracy ==

Modern industrial economies have adopted several aspects of industrial democracy to improve productivity and as reformist measures against industrial disputes.  Often referred to as "teamworking", this form of industrial democracy has been practiced in Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK as well as in several Japanese companies such as [[Toyota]], as an effective alternative to [[Taylorism]].

The term is often used synonymously with [[workplace democracy]], in which the traditional master-servant model of [[employment]] gives way to a participative, power-sharing model.

Isha Johansen is the owner and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Sierra Leone National Premier League]] club [[F.C. Johansen]].

==Early life and family==
Isha Johansen was born as Isha Tejan-Cole in [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]], into the Tejan-Cole family, who are of [[Oku people (Sierra Leone)|Aku]] or [[Sierra Leone Creole|Creole]] descent. She was immersed in football from the very beginning, as her father co-founded [[East End Lions F.C.]] in Freetown.&lt;ref name=IBT&gt;{{cite news |title=Sierra Leone's FA president Isha Johansen: Meet Africa's most powerful woman in football |author=Lydia Smith |newspaper=[[International Business Times]] |date=November 21, 2015 |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/sierra-leones-fa-president-isha-johansen-meet-africas-most-powerful-woman-football-1529757}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father took her to see football matches, and she played football with her brothers and their friends.

She was educated at a convent school in Freeport and a boarding school in [[Yeovil]], England.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |title=Sierra Leone's Isha Johansen blazes trail amid tragedy and infighting |author=Anna Kessel |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=January 24, 2015 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/24/sierra-leone-isha-johansen-ebola-sexism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was raised in a religious [[Muslim]] family. She is married to the [[Norway|Norwegian]] Consul in Sierra Leone, Arne Birger Johansen.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;

==Football==
Isha Johansen founded her own football club, [[F.C. Johansen]], in 2004.&lt;ref name=IBT/&gt; The club was started with the objective of giving guidance and opportunities to children whose lives had been disrupted by the recent [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] (1991-2002).&lt;ref name=IBT/&gt; It began playing in Division One in 2011 and was promoted to the Premier League the following year.

Johansen was elected president of the Sierra Leone Football Association (SLFA) unopposed on 3 August 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africayoungvoices.com/2013/08/isha-johansen-becomes-first-woman-slfa-president/|title=ISHA JOHANSEN  becomes first woman SLFA President|work=africayoungvoices.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; after her main opponent, former Sierra Leone international footballer [[Mohamed Kallon]] was disqualified by the Sierra Leone Football Executive committee for not meeting the SLFA [[residency (domicile)|residency]] requirement in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/sports/summer/football/1015306-fresh-turmoil-in-sierra-leone-football-elections-as-former-player-kallon-disqualified|title=Fresh turmoil in Sierra Leone football elections as former player Kallon disqualified|work=insidethegames.biz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201308010912.html|title=allAfrica.com: Sierra Leone: Kallon, Rodney React to SLFA Disqualification|work=allAfrica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23549250|title=BBC Sport - Fifa endorses decision to ban Kallon from SLFA election|author=Mohamed Fajah Barrie|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kallon appealed his disqualification, but the [[FIFA]] delegation to Freetown confirmed the disqualifications of Kallon and two other candidates
(for links to gambling),&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; so Johansen was unopposed.&lt;ref name="mohamedfajahbarrie"/&gt; When [[Sepp Blatter]] was pressured to step down as head of FIFA, Johansen was touted as a possible successor in the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/03/football/fifa-sepp-blatter-football-isa-johansen/ |title=FIFA elections: Should football elect a woman to replace Sepp Blatter? |author=James Masters |date=February 4, 2016 |publisher=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurosport.com/football/why-can-t-isha-johansen-be-fifa-s-first-female-president_sto4993593/story.shtml |title=Why can't Isha Johansen be FIFA's first female president? |author=Desmond Kane |date=November 18, 2015 |publisher=[[Eurosport]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISOFIX''' is the international standard for attachment points for [[child safety seat]]s in passenger cars. The system has other regional names including '''LATCH''' ("Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children") in the [[United States]] and '''LUAS''' ("Lower Universal Anchorage System") or '''Canfix''' in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.car-safety.org/latch.html |title=Information on LATCH (Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren) |work=Car-Safety.Org |date=February 29, 2008 |accessdate=2008-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been called the "Universal Child Safety Seat System" or '''UCSSS'''.

ISOFIX is [[International Organisation for Standardisation]] standard ISO 13216, which specifies the anchoring system for [[Child_safety_seat#Group_1|Group 1]] child safety seats. It defines standard attachment points to be manufactured into cars, enabling compliant child safety seats to be quickly and safely secured. ISOFIX is an alternative to securing the seat with [[seat belt]]s. Seats are secured with a single attachment at the top (top tether) and two attachments at the base of each side of the seat. The full set of anchor points for this system were required in new cars in the United States starting in September 2002.

In the EU the system is known as ISOFIX and covers both [[Child_safety_seat#Group_0+|Group 0/0+]] and Group 1 child safety seats. The mechanism for attaching the seat to the Lower Anchors is quite different from that in the United States. In the EU two "alligator-like" clips connect the seat to the Lower Anchors rather than the open clip style connectors commonly used in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kidsincars.blogspot.com/search/label/LATCH |title=Information on ISOFIX/LATCH |work=Car Safety for Kids Blog |date=May 8, 2008 |accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some child seat manufacturers are beginning to offer true ISOFIX type attachments in the U.S. In the European standard, there are also various installation categories: "universal", "vehicle-specific" and "semi-universal". The main difference is that "Universal" represents use of a top tether [[strap]] with the ISOFIX anchorage, "vehicle-specific" represents the usage of the ISOFIX anchorage without the top tether in specified vehicles only, while "Semi-Universal" represents usage of the ISOFIX anchorage together with a "foot-prop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britax-roemer.de/upload/download/typenliste/17/DUO%20plus%20Typenliste.pdf | title=DUO plus Typenliste| accessdate=June 26, 2008}}{{Dead link |date=March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britax-roemer.de/upload/download/typenliste/13/SAFEFIX%20plus%20Typenliste.pdf | title=SAFEFIX plus Typenliste | accessdate=June 26, 2008}}{{Dead link |date=March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isofix is designed to secure a maximum combined weight (comprising both seat and child) of 33kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bebeconfort.com/car-seats/car-seat-safety/choosing-a-child-car-seat/why-choose-isofix.aspx#|title=Why choose an ISOFIX car seat?|website=www.bebeconfort.com|access-date=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The center-to-center distance between the anchors of ISOFIX (and also LATCH) systems is 280 mm. 

For [[Child_safety_seat#Group_2|Group 2]]/[[Child_safety_seat#Group_3|3]] seats there is a system called ISOFIT which anchors the seat to the vehicle so it cannot slide around when not in use. In the case of Isofit, the child is held into the seat using the vehicle's existing seat belt system, not the safety seat's straps.

On September 19, 2014, the Australian government legalized the use of ISOFIX child seats. Prior to this date, their sale (and use) in Australia was illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/308969/isofix-seats-legalised-for-australia | title=ISOFIX child seats legalised for Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The ISOFIX system was developed jointly by child safety seat maker [[Britax|Britax-Römer]] and automobile maker [[Volkswagen|VW]], with the first compatible products released in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britaxusa.com/learning-center/history-heritage | title=Britax history and heritage | accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISO 13216 part 1 (covering lower anchorage points) was published in 1999. Part 2, covering top tether anchorages was published in December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=30437 | title=ISO 13216-1:1999 | accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36058 | title=ISO 13216-2:2004 | accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amendments to include ISOFIX in UN ECE Regulations 14 &amp; 44, which specify uniform provisions for the design of vehicle seat anchorages and child safety seats, came into force in February 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/doc/2003/wp29/TRANS-WP29-2003-38e.pdf | title=United Nations ECE Working Party on Passive Safety - Proposal for draft supplement 5 to the 03 series of amendments to Regulation No 44 | accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp29/wp29regs/r044r2e.pdf | title=UN ECE Regulation No 44 | accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the current UN/ECE R14, all new vehicles produced since February 2013 are required to have ISOFIX lower anchorages and top tether attachments.

'''James Stedman Dixon''' (8 January 1845 – 18 July 1911) was a leading Scottish coal-mine owner, President of the Mining Institute of Scotland and of the Institution of Mining Engineers of Great Britain, and founder of the James S. Dixon Chair of Applied Geology in the [[University of Glasgow]].

== Early life and education ==
James Stedman Dixon was born at Glasgow on 8 January 1845, son of stockbroker Peter Watson Dixon and Jane Dow. The family moving to Hamilton in 1850, James Dixon attended the prestigious [[Hamilton Academy]] school, later attending classes in  engineering at the [[University of Glasgow]] under [[William John Macquorn Rankine|Professor Macquorn Rankine]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/eyrwho/eyrwho0510.htm University of Strathclyde archive. Who’s Who in Glasgow 1909. James Stedman Dixon] Retrieved 30 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Apprenticed in 1863 to George Simpson, mining engineer of Glasgow, Dixon was to be made a partner in the Simpson firm in 1869, and on George Simpson’s death in 1871, took over the whole business. In the following year, Dixon started the Bent Colliery Company which was to become the largest mining operation in the Hamilton area. In 1890 Dixon expanded his interests by acquiring the mining division of James Dunlop and Co., of [[Clyde Iron Works]], subsequently giving up his engineering business to concentrate on his mining interests which between them were producing some 1,250,000 tons of mined coal per annum. By 1898 his Bent Colliery business having greatly increased, Dixon was able to give up his interest in the Dunlop concern to concentrate on other interests, becoming Chairman of the Broxburn Oil Company and a director of both the Edinburgh Colliery Company and the Plean Colliery, among other business concerns.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

== Appointments and interests ==
Dixon was twice elected to serve as President of the Lanarkshire Coalmasters' Association, and was to become the first President of the Coalmasters' Insurance Association, formed as a result of the requirements of the [[Workmen's Compensation Act 1897|Workmen's Compensation Act]]. He was later to serve (twice) as  President of the Mining Institute of Scotland (eventually through mergers becoming in 2002 the [[Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mining-scotland.org/history.htm Mining Institute of Scotland - list of Presidents] Retrieved 30 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and as President of the Institution of Mining Engineers of Great Britain; and was appointed to the Royal Commission on Coal Supplies.

In 1902 Dixon endowed a Lectureship in Mining Engineering in the [[University of Glasgow]] increasing this endowment in 1907 to found the '''James S. Dixon Chair of Mining''', appointments being made jointly between the University of Glasgow and the Royal Technical College (renamed in 1956 the [[Royal College of Science and Technology]] and in 1964 becoming the [[University of Strathclyde]]). In 1932, another notable former pupil of [[Hamilton Academy]], [[Andrew Bryan (engineer)|Andrew Bryan]] was appointed to this Chair, as Professor of Mining.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/chair-and-lectureship/?id=837 University of Glasgow.

Dixon Chair of Applied Geology''' in the University of Glasgow. For his services to education, James Dixon was awarded the degree of [[Legum Doctor|LLD]] by the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH0034&amp;type=P University of Glasgow.

'''''John Deere: American Farmer''''' is a [[farm]] [[construction and management simulation games|construction and management simulation]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] featuring the [[John Deere]] license, developed by [[Gabriel Entertainment]], published by [[Take 2 Interactive]] and [[Destineer|Destineer Studios]].

The goal of the game is to make a living by raising livestock such as beef cattle, dairy cows, and pigs, or by growing crops such as sunflowers, soybeans, wheat and corn. Players must contend with factors such as weather, market demand, employee skill.

There is a variety of John Deere equipment to choose from such as the 7820, 9520 and 5303 tractors with numerous attachments, and the 9660 combine with a hydraflex and corn headers. There are also smaller vehicles such as the John Deere Gator and ATVs. There is a built-in [[map editor]] that enables players to create their own map.

In 2006 a sequel, ''John Deere: American Farmer Deluxe'' was released and received positive reviews.

==Overview==
{{quote|text=We’re now entering the third industrial revolution, Anderson said. The first one, which began with the [[spinning jenny]] in 1776, doubled the human life span and set population soaring. From the demographic perspective, "it’s as if nothing happened before the Industrial Revolution."

The next revolution was digital. Formerly industrial processes like printing were democratized with [[desktop publishing]]. The "cognitive surplus" of formerly passive consumers was released into an endless variety of personal creativity. Then distribution was democratized by the Web, which is "scale agnostic and credentials agnostic." Anyone can potentially reach 7 billion people.

The third revolution is digital manufacturing, which combines the gains of the first two revolutions. Factory robots, which anyone can hire, have become general purpose and extremely fast. They allow "lights-out manufacturing," that goes all night and all weekend.

"This will reverse the arrow of globalization," Anderson said. "The centuries of quest for cheaper labor is over. Labor arbitrage no longer drives trade." The advantages of speed and flexibility give the advantage to "locavore" manufacturing because "Closer is faster." Innovation is released from the dead weight of large-batch commitments. Designers now can sit next to the robots building their designs and make adjustments in real time.

'''''Management Science''''' is a [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] that covers research on all aspects of [[management]] related to [[Strategic management|strategy]], [[entrepreneurship]], innovation, [[information technology]], and organizations as well as all functional areas of [[business]], such as [[accounting]], [[finance]], [[marketing]], and [[Operations research|operations]]. It is published by the [[Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences]] and was established in 1954 by the Institute's precursor, The Institute of Management Sciences. According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the journal has an [[impact factor]] of 2.822.&lt;ref name=WoS&gt;{{cite book |year=2016 |chapter=Management Science |title=2016 [[Journal Citation Reports]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |edition=Science |series=[[Web of Science]] |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
On December 1, 1953 at the founding meeting at Columbia University, [[The Institute of Management Sciences]] was voted into existence and William Cooper was elected as the first president. Establishment of a journal, to be called ''Management Science'', was made the first order of business. Almost immediately after the meeting, Cooper recruited [[C. West Churchman]] to be the founding editor. Cooper, Churchman, and Abe Charnes then wrote the policy statement for the journal. Within weeks Churchman had assembled an [[editorial board]] and had the first issue ready for distribution at the first membership meeting of the institute in October 1954.

C. West Churchman quickly built ''Management Science'', both in size and reputation. By 1960 when he stepped down as editor, the journal was publishing almost twice as many papers per year as it had in the first volume. True to his vision, Churchman published papers representing a wide range of disciplines, from optimization, inventory, and [[game theory]] to [[management psychology]], leadership, and the [[epistemology of science]].&lt;ref&gt; https://www.informs.org/content/download/166515/1701945/file/Churchman%20Tribute.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=October 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3040">Felipe '''Martin de Villamil''' or '''Martin Villamil''' ("Gonzalez de la Galea y Villamil" or "Villamil Joly") (1783-1843) was a trader in the Caribbeans and in Europe.

== In the Caribbeans ==

Martin de Villamil, brother of the Ecuadorian independence hero [[José de Villamil]], was born in [[New Orleans]], [[Spanish Louisiana]], in 1783, son of a trader and administrator (mayordomo) of the hospital of the city.  He became a trader in the Caribbean.

In 1809, he married the daughter of the lieutenant of the king of Spain in [[Panama]] (1).  Around 1812, he was one of the cofounders of the trade consulate in [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]]. Later, he lived in [[Jamaica]], where he owned sugar cane plantations.

== In Europe ==
After that, Martin de Villamil and his family went to Europe: London, Paris, Italy (Bologna, Firenze).  In 1820-1822, he welcomed in his villa of Sèvres, near Paris, the great Irish poet [[Thomas Moore]] (1779-1853).

In 1830, Martin Villamil met in Paris the général [[Francisco de Paula Santander]] (1792-1840), hero of the independence of [[Great Colombia]].

In Bologna, he may have been a British consul. In Firenze, Madame Martin de Villamil, was a friend of [[Jérôme Bonaparte]] (brother of [[Napoléon Bonaparte]]), former king of Westphalia, who gave her the guard of his daughter, la [[Mathilde Bonaparte|princesse Mathilde]], and of his  house.

Martin de Villamil died in Paris in 1843.

In the writings of [[Karl Marx]] and the [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory of [[historical materialism]], a '''mode of production''' (in German: ''Produktionsweise'', meaning "the way of producing") is a specific combination of the following:
* [[Productive forces]]: these include human [[labour power]] and [[means of production]] (e.g. tools, productive machinery, commercial and industrial buildings, other infrastructure, technical knowledge, materials, plants, animals and exploitable land).
* Social and technical [[relations of production]]: these include the property, power and control relations governing society's productive assets (often codified in law), cooperative work relations and forms of association, relations between people and the objects of their work and the relations between social classes.

Marx regarded productive ability and participation in [[social relations]] as two essential characteristics of human beings and that the particular modality of these relations in [[capitalist]] production are inherently in conflict with the increasing development of human productive capacities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch11.htm#p594 Marx, Grundrisse. (English Translation)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A precursor to this concept was [[Adam Smith]]'s concept of mode of subsistence, which delineated a progression of society types based on the way in which society's members provided for their basic needs.&lt;ref name="New Voices on Adam Smith"&gt;''New Voices on Adam Smith'', by Leonidas Montes, Eric Schliesser. Routledge, March 2006. P 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance of concept ==
Building on the four-stage theory of human development of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] – Hunting/Pastoral/Agricultural/Commercial Societies, each with its own socio-cultural characteristics&lt;ref&gt;R Meek, ''Social Science and the Ignoble Savage'' (Cambridge 1976) p. 117-9 and p. 186-8&lt;/ref&gt; - Marx articulated the concept of mode of production:  “The mode of production in material life determines the general character of the social, political, and spiritual processes of life”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J Childers ed., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (New York 1995) p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx considered that the way people relate to the physical world and the way people relate to each other socially are bound up together in specific and necessary ways: “men [who] produce cloth, linen, silk...also produce the ‘social relations’ amid which they prepare cloth and linen”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J O’Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (London 1972) p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; People must consume to survive, but to consume they must produce and in producing they necessarily enter into relations which exist independently of their will.

For Marx, the whole secret of why/how a social order exists and the causes of social change must be discovered in the specific mode of production that a society has.&lt;ref&gt;M Hardt ed., ''The Jameson Reader'' (Oxford 2000) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He further argued that the mode of production substantively shaped the nature of the mode of distribution, the mode of circulation and the mode of consumption, all of which together constitute the economic sphere. To understand the way wealth was distributed and consumed, it was necessary to understand the conditions under which it was produced.

A mode of production is historically distinctive for Marx because it constitutes part of an organic totality (or self-reproducing whole) which is capable of constantly re-creating its own initial conditions and thus perpetuate itself in a more or less stable ways for centuries, or even millennia. By performing social [[surplus labour]] in a specific system of property relations, the labouring classes constantly [[reproduction (economics)|reproduce]] the foundations of the social order. A mode of production normally shapes the mode of distribution, circulation and consumption and is regulated by the [[State (polity)|state]]. As Marx wrote to [[Pavel Annenkov|Annenkov]], “Assume particular stages of development in production, commerce and consumption and you will have a corresponding social order, a corresponding organization of the family and of the ranks and classes, in a word, a corresponding civil society”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J O’Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (London 1972) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; 

However any given mode of production will also contain within it (to a greater or lesser extent) relics of earlier modes, as well as seeds of new ones.&lt;ref&gt;M Hardt ed., ''The Jameson Reader'' (Oxford 2000) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  The emergence of new productive forces will cause conflict in the current mode of production. When conflict arises, the modes of production can evolve within the current structure or cause a complete breakdown.

=== Process of socioeconomic change ===
The process by which social and economic systems evolve is based on the premise of improving technology. Specifically, as the level of technology improves, existing forms of social relations become increasingly insufficient for fully exploiting technology. This generates internal inefficiencies within the broader socioeconomic system, most notably in the form of [[class conflict]]. The obsolete social arrangements prevent further social progress while generating increasingly severe contradictions between the level of technology (forces of production) and social structure (social relations, conventions and organization of production) which develop to a point where the system can no longer sustain itself and is overthrown through internal [[social revolution]] that allows for the emergence of new forms of social relations that are compatible with the current level of technology (productive forces).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/m/o.htm#mode-production, Marxism.org: Mode of Production.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental driving force behind structural changes in the socioeconomic organization of civilization are underlying material concerns—specifically, the level of technology and extent of human knowledge and the forms of social organization they make possible. This comprises what Marx termed the [[Historical materialism|materialist conception of history]] (see also [[materialism]]) and is in contrast to an [[Idealism|idealist analysis]], (such as that criticised by Marx in [[Proudhon]]),&lt;ref&gt;J O’Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (London 1972) p. 115-6&lt;/ref&gt;  which states that the fundamental driving force behind socioeconomic change are the ideas of enlightened individuals.

==Modes of Production==
===Tribal and neolithic modes of production===
Marx and Engels often referred to the "first" mode of production as [[primitive communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Sociology  |last=Scott |first=John |authorlink= |author2=Marshall, Gordon |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=USA |isbn=978-0-19-860987-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In classical Marxism, the two earliest modes of production  were those of the tribal band or horde, and of the [[neolithic]] kinship group. &lt;ref&gt;M Hardt ed., ''The Jameson Reader'' (Oxford 2000) p. 46-7&lt;/ref&gt; Tribal bands of [[hunter gatherer]]s represented for most of human history the only form of possible existence. Technological progress in the Stone Age was very slow; social stratification was very limited (as were personal possessions, hunting grounds being held in common);&lt;ref&gt;J Diamond, ''The World Until Yesterday'' (Penguin 2012) p. 13-1&lt;/ref&gt; and myth, ritual and magic are seen as the main cultural forms.&lt;ref&gt;M Hardt ed., ''The Jameson Reader'' (Oxford 2000) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; 

With the adoption of [[agriculture]] at the outset of the [[Neolithic Revolution]], and accompanying technological advances in pottery, brewing, baking, and weaving,&lt;ref&gt;G Childe, ''What Happened in History'' (Penguin 1954) p. 60-2&lt;/ref&gt; there came a modest increase in social stratification, and the birth of [[social class|class]]&lt;ref&gt;J Diamond, ''The World Until Yesterday'' (London 2012) p. 15-17&lt;/ref&gt; with [[private property]] held in hierarchical kinship groups or clans.&lt;ref&gt;M Hardt ed., ''The Jameson Reader'' (Oxford 2000) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Animism]] was replaced by a new emphasis on gods of fertility;&lt;ref&gt;Y Harari, ''Sapiens'' (London 2011) p. 235-7&lt;/ref&gt; and a move from matriarchy to patriarchy (arguably) took place at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;M Hardt ed., ''The Jameson Reader'' (Oxford 2000) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asiatic mode of production ===
The [[Asiatic mode of production]] is a controversial contribution to Marxist theory, first used to explain pre-slave and pre-feudal large earthwork constructions in India, the Euphrates and Nile river valleys (and named on this basis of the primary evidence coming from greater "Asia"). The Asiatic mode of production is said to be the initial form of class society, where a small group extracts social surplus through violence aimed at settled or unsettled band and village communities within a domain. It was made possible by a technological advance in data-processing – writing, cataloguing and archiving&lt;ref&gt;Y Harari, ''Sapiens'' (London 2011) p. 137 and p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; - as well as by associated advances in standardisation of weights and measures, mathematics, calendar-making and irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;G Childe, ''What Happened in History'' (Penguin 1954) p. 117-125&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploited labour is extracted as forced corvee labour during a slack period of the year (allowing for monumental construction such as the pyramids, ziggurats and ancient Indian communal baths). Exploited labour is also extracted in the form of goods directly seized from the exploited communities. The primary property form of this mode is the direct religious possession of communities (villages, bands, and hamlets, and all those within them) by the gods: in a typical example, three-quarters of the property would be allotted to individual families, while the remaining quarter would be worked for the [[theocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;G Childe, ''What Happened in History'' (Penguin 1954) p. 94-5&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling class of this society is generally a semi-theocratic aristocracy which claims to be the incarnation of gods on earth. The forces of production associated with this society include basic agricultural techniques, massive construction, irrigation, and storage of goods for social benefit (granaries). Because of the unproductive use of the creamed-off surplus, such Asiatic empires tended to be doomed to fall into decay.&lt;ref&gt;A R Burn, ''Persia and the Greeks'' (Stanford 1984) p. 565&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antique or ancient mode of production ===
Sometimes referred to as "[[slave]] society," an alternative route out of neolithic self-sufficiency came in the form of the [[polis]] or [[city-state]]. Technological advances in the form of cheap iron tools, [[Coin|coinage]], and the [[Greek alphabet|alphabet]], and the division of labour between industry, trade and farming enabled new and larger units to develop in the form of the polis,&lt;ref&gt;G Childe, ''What Happened in History'' (Penguin 1954) p. 25 and 196-7&lt;/ref&gt; which called in turn for new forms of social aggregation. A host of urban associations – formal and informal – took over from earlier familial and tribal groupings.&lt;ref&gt;O. Murray ed., ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (Oxford 1991) p. 207-10 &lt;/ref&gt; Constitutionally agreed law replaced the [[Feud|vendetta]]&lt;ref&gt;M Hardt ed., ''The Jameson Reader'' (Oxford 2000) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; - an advance celebrated in such new urban cultural forms as [[Greek tragedy]]: thus, as [[Robert Fagles]] put it, “The ''[[Oresteia]]'' is our rite of passage from savagery to civilization...from the blood vendetta to the social justice”.&lt;ref&gt;R Fagles trans., ''The Oresteia'' (Penguin 1981) p. 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical Greek and Roman societies are the most typical examples of this antique mode of production. The forces of production associated with this mode include advanced (two field) agriculture, the extensive use of animals in agriculture, industry (mining and pottery), and advanced trade networks. It is differentiated from the Asiatic mode, in that property forms included the direct possession of individual human beings([[Slavery in Ancient Greece|slavery]]); while the ruling class usually avoids the more outlandish claims of being the direct incarnation of a god and prefers to be the descendants of gods, or seeks other justifications for its rule, including varying degrees of popular participation in politics.

It was, however, not democracy but rather the universalising of its citizenship that eventually enabled Rome to set up a Mediterranean-wide urbanised empire, knit together by roads, harbours, lighthouses, aqueducts, and bridges, and with engineers, architects, traders and industrialists fostering interprovincial trade between a growing set of urban centres.&lt;ref&gt;G Childe, ''What Happened in History'' (Penguin 1954) p. 263-73&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feudal mode of production ===
The fall of the Western Roman Empire returned most of Western Europe to subsistence agriculture, dotted with ghost towns and obsolete trade-routes&lt;ref&gt;P Wolff, ''The Awakening of Europe'' (Penguin 1968) p. 22-3&lt;/ref&gt; Authority too was localised, in a world of poor roads and difficult farming conditions.&lt;ref&gt;R W Southern ''The Making of the Middle Ages'' (London 1993) p. 20 and p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; The new social form which emerged in place of the ties of family or clan, of sacred theocracy or legal citizenship was a relationship based on the personal tie of vassal to lord, cemented by the link to landholding in the guise of the [[fief]].&lt;ref&gt;J M Wallace-Hadrill, ''The Barbarian West'' (London 1964) p. 110-1 and p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; This was the [[feudalism|feudal mode of production]], which dominated the systems of the West between the fall of the classical world and the rise of capitalism (similar systems existing in most of the world as well){{citeneeded|date=September 2018}}. This period also saw the decentralization of the ancient [[empire]]s into the earliest [[nation-state]]s.
 
The primary form of property is the possession of land in reciprocal contract relations, military service for knights, labour services to the lord of the manor by peasants or serfs tied to and entailed upon the land.&lt;ref&gt;Barrington Moore Jr, ''Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy'' (Penguin 1977) p. 419 and p. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; Exploitation occurs through reciprocated contract (though ultimately resting on the threat of forced extractions).&lt;ref&gt;"The very essence of feudal property was exploitation in its most naked form", [[R H Tawney]], ''Religion and the Rise of Capitalism'' (London 1937) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling class is usually a [[nobility]] or [[aristocracy]], typically legitimated by some concurrent form of [[theocracy]]. The primary forces of production include highly complex agriculture (two, three field, lucerne fallowing and manuring) with the addition of non-human and non-animal power devices (clockwork and wind-mills) and the intensification of specialisation in the crafts—craftsmen exclusively producing one specialised class of product.{{citeneeded|date=September 2018}}

The prevailing ideology was of a hierarchical system of society, tempered by the element of reciprocity and contract in the feudal tie.&lt;ref&gt;W Ullmann ''A history of Political Thought in the Middle Ages'' (Penguin 1965) p. 90 and p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; While, as [[Frederic William Maitland|Maitland]] warned, the feudal system had many variations, extending as it did over more than half a continent, and half a millennium,&lt;ref&gt;G C Coulton ''Medieval Panorama'' (Cambridge 1938) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless the many forms all had at their core a relationship that (in the words of [[John Burrow]]) was “at once legal and social, military and economic...at once a way of organising military force, a social hierarchy, an ethos and what Marx would later call a mode of production”.&lt;ref&gt;J Burrow, ''A History of Histories'' (Penguin 2009) p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, a [[merchant class]] arises and grows in strength, driven by the [[profit motive]] but  prevented from developing further profits by the nature of feudal society, in which, for instance, the serfs are tied to the land and cannot become industrial workers and wage-earners. This eventually precipitates an epoch of social revolution (i.e.: the [[English Civil War]] and the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, etc.) wherein the social and political organization of feudal society (or the ''property relations'' of feudalism) are overthrown by a nascent [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref name=preface&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm Marx, ''Preface to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy''] Marx, ''Early writings'', Penguin, 1975, p425-6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capitalist mode of production ===
By the close of the Middle Ages, the feudal system had been increasingly hollowed out by the growth of free towns, the commutation for money of servile labour,&lt;ref&gt;G C Coulton ''Medieval Panorama'' (Cambridge 1938) p. 73-6 and 284-6&lt;/ref&gt; the replacement of the feudal host by a paid soldiery, and the divorce of retainership from land tenure&lt;ref&gt;Barrington Moore Jr, ''Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy'' (Penguin 1977) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; - even if feudal privileges, ethics and enclaves would persist in Europe till the end of the millennium in rsidual forms.&lt;ref&gt;M Scott, ''Medieval Europe'' (London 1964) p. 241 and p. 420&lt;/ref&gt; Feudalism was succeeded by what Smith called the Age of Commerce, and Marx the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], which spans the period from [[mercantilism]] to [[imperialism]] and beyond, and is usually associated with the emergence of modern industrial society and the global [[market economy]].  Marx maintained that central to the new capitalist system was the replacement of a system of money serving as the key to commodity exchange (C-M-C, commerce), by a system of money leading (via commodities) to the re-investment of money in further production (M-C-M’, capitalism) - the new and overriding social imperative.&lt;ref&gt;M Hardt ed., ''The Jameson Reader'' (Oxford 2000) p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; 

The primary form of property is that of private property in commodity form – land, materials, tools of production, and human labour, all being potentially commodified and open to exchange in a cash nexus by way of (state guaranteed) contract: as Marx put it, “man himself is brought into the sphere of private property”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J O’Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (London 1972) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary form of exploitation is by way of (formally free) [[wage labour]] (see ''[[Das Kapital]]'',&lt;ref&gt;J O’Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (London 1972) p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; with debt peonage,&lt;ref&gt;Y Harari, ''Sapiens'' (London 2011) p. 368-71&lt;/ref&gt; [[wage slavery]], and other forms of [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]]) also possible. The ruling class for Marx is the [[bourgeoisie]], or the owners of capital who possess the [[means of production]], who exploit the [[proletariat]] for [[surplus value]], as the proletarians possess only their own [[labour power]] which they must sell in order to survive.&lt;ref&gt;P. King, ''The Philosophy Book'' (London 2011) p. 199-200&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yuval Harari]] reconceptualised the dichotomy for the 21st Century in terms of the rich who invest to re-invest, and the remainder who go into debt in order to consume for the benefit of the owners of the means of production.&lt;ref&gt;Y Harari, ''Sapiens'' (London 2011) p. 390&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under [[Capitalism]] the key forces of production include the overall system of modern production with its [[Base and superstructure|supporting structures]] of [[bureaucracy]], [[bourgeois democracy]], and above all [[Financial capital|finance capital]].  The system’s ideological underpinnings took place over the course of time, [[Frederic Jameson]] for example considering that “the [[Age of Enlightenment|Western Enlightenment]] may be grasped as part of a properly bourgeois cultural revolution, in which the values and the discourse, the habits and the daily space, of the ancien régime were systematically dismantled so that in their place could be set the new conceptualities, habits and life forms, and value systems of a capitalist market society”&lt;ref&gt;M Hardt ed., ''The Jameson Reader'' (Oxford 2000) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; - [[utilitarianism]], rationalised production ([[Weber]]), training and discipline ([[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]) and a new capitalist time-structure.&lt;ref&gt;M Hardt ed., ''The Jameson Reader'' (Oxford 2000) p. 47-50 and p. 277-8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socialist mode of production ===
[[Socialism]] is the mode of production which Marx considered will succeed capitalism, and which will itself ultimately be succeeded by communism - the words socialism and communism both predate Marx and have many definitions other than those he used, however - once the forces of production outgrew the capitalist framework.&lt;ref&gt;E H Carr, ''The Bolshevik Revolution 2'' (Penguin 1971) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his 1917 work ''[[The State and Revolution]]'', Lenin divided [[communism]], the period following the overthrow of capitalism, into two stages: first socialism, and then later, once the last vestiges of the old capitalist ways have withered away, [[stateless communism]] or pure communism. Marx typically used the terms the "first phase" of communism and the "higher phase" of communism, but Lenin points to later remarks by Engels which suggest that Marx's "first phase" of communism typically equates with what people commonly think of as socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ |title=The State and Revolution |last=Lenin |first=Vladimir |date=1917 |website=Lenin Internet Archive at marxists.org |accessdate=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Socialist mode of production|Marxist definition of socialism]] is a mode of production where the sole criterion for production is [[use-value]] and therefore the [[law of value]] no longer directs economic activity. Marxist [[production for use]] is coordinated through conscious [[economic planning]],&lt;ref&gt;E H Carr, ''The Bolshevik Revolution 2'' (Penguin 1971) p. 15-6&lt;/ref&gt;  while distribution of economic output is based on the principle of [[to each according to his contribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marx |first=Karl |title=Critique of the Gotha Programme}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social relations of socialism are characterized by the working class effectively owning the means of production and the means of their livelihood, through one or a combination of cooperative enterprises, [[common ownership]], or worker's [[Workers' self-management|self-management]].

[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] deliberately wrote very little on socialism, neglecting to provide any details on how it might be organized on the grounds that, until the new mode of production had itself emerged, all such theories would be merely Utopian: as [[Georges Sorel]] put it, “to attempt to erect an ideological superstructure in advance of the conditions of production on which it must be built...would be un-Marxist”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in E H Carr, ''The Bolshevik Revolution 2'' (Penguin 1971) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  However, later in life, Marx pointed to the [[Paris Commune]] as the first example of a proletarian uprising and the model for a future socialist society organized into [[commune]]s, observing:

{{cquote|The Commune was formed of the municipal councilors, chosen by universal suffrage in the various wards of the town, responsible and revocable at any time. The majority of its members were naturally working men, or acknowledged representatives of the working class.... The police, which until then had been the instrument of the Government, was at once stripped of its political attributes, and turned into the responsible, and at all times revocable, agent of the Commune. So were the officials of all other branches of the administration. From the members of the Commune downwards, the public service had to be done at workmen's wages. The privileges and the representation allowances of the high dignitaries of state disappeared along with the high dignitaries themselves.... Having once got rid of the standing army and the police, the instruments of physical force of the old government, the Commune proceeded at once to break the instrument of spiritual suppression, the power of the priests.... The judicial functionaries lost that sham independence... they were thenceforward to be elective, responsible, and revocable... The Commune, was to be a working, not a parliamentary, body, executive and legislative at the same time...Instead of deciding once in three or six years which member of the ruling class was to represent and repress the people in parliament, universal suffrage was to serve the people constituted in communes, as individual suffrage serves every other employer in the search for workers, foremen and accountants for his business.&lt;ref name=civilwar&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/index.htm |last1=Marx |first1=Karl |last2=Engels |first2=Friedrich |title=The Civil War in France |date=1871 |website=Marx/Engels Archive at marxists.org |accessdate=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Communist mode of production ===
[[Communism]] is the final mode of production, anticipated to arise inevitably from socialism due to historical forces. Marx did not speak in detail about the nature of a [[communist society]], which he would describe interchangeably with the words socialism and communism. He did however refer briefly in the ''[[Critique of the Gotha Programme]]'' to the full release of productive forces in "the highest phase of communist society...[when] society will be able to inscribe on its banner: ‘From each according to his capacities, to each according to his needs'”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in E H Carr, ''The Bolshevik Revolution 2'' (Penguin 1971) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

== Articulation of modes of production ==
In any specific society or country, different modes of production might emerge and exist alongside each other, linked together economically through trade and mutual obligations. To these different modes correspond different [[social classes]] and strata in the population. For example, urban capitalist industry might co-exist with rural peasant production for subsistence and simple exchange and tribal hunting and gathering. Old and new modes of production might combine to form a hybrid economy.

However, Marx's view was that the expansion of capitalist markets tended to dissolve and displace older ways of producing over time. A capitalist society was a society in which the capitalist mode of production had become the dominant one. The culture, laws and customs of that society might preserve many traditions of the preceding modes of production, thus although two countries might both be capitalist, being economically based mainly on private enterprise for profit and wage labour, these capitalisms might be very different in social character and functioning, reflecting very different cultures, religions, social rules and histories.

Elaborating on this idea, [[Leon Trotsky]] famously described the economic development of the world as a process of [[uneven and combined development]] of different co-existing societies and modes of production which all influence each other. This means that historical changes which took centuries to occur in one country might be truncated, abbreviated or telescoped in another. Thus, for example, Trotsky observes in the opening chapter of his history of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] that "[s]avages throw away their bows and arrows for rifles all at once, without travelling the road which lay between these two weapons in the past. The European colonists in America did not begin history all over again from the beginning". Thus, old and new techniques and cultures might combine in novel and unique admixtures, which cannot be understood other than by tracing out the history of their emergence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6922">In the [[utilities]] industry, the '''Prudent Investment Rule''' refers to a series of state standards which determine the fiscal soundness of a utility in the course of rate recovery for recoverable capital costs to be determined by that state’s [[Public Utilities Commission|Public Service Commission]] (PSC). The determination is established through a series of filings from the utility to the PSC and hearings conducted by the PSC. This occurs during a prudency hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zacher|first=Glenn|title=Prudency review required before deferred revenue can be recovered|url=http://www.stikeman.com/cps/rde/xchg/se-en/hs.xsl/14102.htm|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The PSC follows these standards to determine if the capital costs were a "prudent investment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Managing Risk: Prudency Reviews and Nuclear Projects|url=http://www.fortnightly.com/fortnightly/2006/02/managing-risk-prudence-reviews-and-nuclear-projects|publisher=Fortnightly|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To determine the prudency of the investment, the PSC applies the prudent investment test or standard, determining if the costs were reasonable at the time they were incurred, and given the circumstances and what was known or knowable at the time, are to be included in the firm's rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rose|first=Kenneth|title=Electric Power: Traditional Monopoly Franchise Regulation and Rate Making|year=2004|publisher=Elsevier Science &amp; Technology|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is commonly used as an oversight tool by the government to ensure that money invested into a project is being spent as it was intended so the utility may recoup some costs in construction through a recovery in rates, hence the title prudent investment rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions FAQs|url=http://www.psc.sc.gov/Documents/Consumer%20Information/Frequently%20Asked%20Questions%20PDF%20For%20Website.pdf|publisher=Public Service Commission of South Carolina|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulators can consider cases of hidden imprudence, but are required to consider what was known or knowable at the time the decision was made by the PSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rose|first=Kenneth|title=Electric Power: Traditional Monopoly Franchise Regulation and Rate Making|year=2004|publisher=Elsevier Science &amp; Technology|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                
The term Prudent Investment Rule, and the associated standards, have been established through a series of legal precedents.  The first case to set precedent was the [[United States Supreme Court]] case of [[Munn v. Illinois]] in 1877, which allowed states to have a say in rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Munn v. Illinois|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/94/113|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the nature of recoverable capital costs was defined, a second question remained as to the rate at which that capital could be recovered.  This issue was reasonably addressed in 1935 in Bluefield Water Works &amp; Improvement Co. v. Public Service Commission of West Virginia, when the court said that a public utility is entitled to such rates as will permit it to earn a return equal to that generally being made at the same time and in the same general part of the country on investments in other business undertakings which are attended by corresponding risks and uncertainties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bluefield Waterworks Improvement Company v. Public Service Commission of West Virginia|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bluefield_Waterworks_Improvement_Company_v._Public_Service_Commission_of_West_Virginia|publisher=WikiSource|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages of Rate of Return Regulation with Prudent Investment Rule==
[[Rate-of-return regulation|Rate-of-return Regulation]] is a system for setting the prices charged by government-regulated monopolies, such as utility companies. There are several advantages to using [[rate-of-return regulation]]. The first is that it is sustainable if there is no competition because prices can be adjusted to the company’s changing conditions. It can also provide comfort to investors because [[rate-of-return regulation]] constrains the regulator’s discretion in setting prices. This lowers investor risk, which lowers the cost of capital. Company profits can be kept within acceptable levels from the perspectives of both investors and customers. Unless the regulator chronically underestimates the cost of capital (and courts do not reverse the regulator in this regard), investors can be confident they have a fair opportunity to receive the profits they expect and thus are willing to make investments. Customers can observe that the regulator is limiting company profits to the cost of capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rate of Return: Regulation|year=1996|publisher=Mark A. Jamison Public Utility Research Center, University of Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disallowance==
According to [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], there are five categories that plants under construction may fall into that keep them from being included in the rate base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prudence Issues Affecting the U.S. Electric Utility Industry|url=http://web.ornl.gov/info/reports/1987/3445602684959.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Imprudence: When a utility fails to show that it made prudent decisions in [[Public utilities commission|Public Service Commission]] hearings, then the facility being reviewed is [[disallow]]ed from the rate base.
# [[Excess Capacity]]: Regardless of prudence, a plant recently constructed may not be included in the rate base if it is ruled to have a generating capacity that is in excess of what is needed by the ratepayers. Each jurisdiction will calculate excess capacity differently. This is not a permanent disallowance and if the need of the customer or ratepayer grows then the plant can again be included in the rate base. 
# Cost Caps: In rare cases the [[Public Utilities Commission]] will set a cap on construction costs for a new facility. If the plant is completed at a higher cost, then this excess cost may not be allowed in the rate base.
# Economic Value: The actual economic value of the recently constructed plant may be found to be less than the construction costs. A plant under construction should be regularly evaluated to ensure that continued construction is in the best interest of the ratepayer.
# Other: This category includes any other reason that a facility may be disallowed from the rate base. This includes canceled construction. If a plant is canceled then it is not “used and useful” and may be completely disallowed from the rate base or allowed to recover prudent costs with no return recovery on the balance or allowed to recover prudent costs with a recovery of the debt return from the unrecovered balance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4265">'''Robert Cooper''' (1777-1857) was an Australian businessman in the early Colonial era of Sydney, responsible for the construction of many notable buildings and commercial ventures.

Cooper was born in [[London]] on 15 May 1777 to [[fishmonger]] Francis and Frances (née Pilkinton) Cooper,&lt;ref&gt;The National Archives - England &amp; Wales Prerogative Court of Canterbury Wills, 1384-1858&lt;/ref&gt; and ran two [[public house]]s in [[London]], the White Swan on [[Ratcliffe Highway]] in the [[East End|docklands]] and another in [[Piccadilly]].  In October 1812 he was convicted of [[smuggle|smuggling]] and [[receiving stolen goods]] and was sentenced to [[penal transportation]] for fourteen years to [[New South Wales]]&lt;ref&gt;'[[Old Bailey]]', [[London Times|Times]] (London), 31 Oct 1812, p 2, 2 Nov 1812, p 3 and 3 Nov 1812, p 2&lt;/ref&gt; arriving on the [[Earl Spencer (1795 EIC ship)|''Earl Spencer'']] in October 1813. He received a conditional pardon in 1818.

[[File:1_Juniper_Hall-1.jpg|thumb|330px|Juniper Hall]]In Sydney he was a prolific businessessmen. a partner in ''Cooper and Levey'', he opened a shop in [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] opposite the [[Sydney Town Hall|Town Hall]] and was running trading ventures to [[Tasmania|Van Deimansland]] in a small ship he bought. He also obtained an [[Auctioneer]]'s licence and opened a [[distillery]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://scratchingsydneyssurface.wordpress.com/tag/robert-cooper/  Scratching Sydneys Surface].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[brewery]]. 
Other ventures included [[flour mill|milling flour]] and bread, [[Cedar wood|cedar]] cutting, production of gunpowder, and weaving of cloth.

By 1830 he was one of the most wealthy men in [[Sydney]] becoming one of the principal shareholders in the [[Bank of New South Wales]]. He also owned large tracts of land in Paddington, [[Chippendale, New South Wales|Chippendale]], [[Leichardt, New South Wales|Leichardt]] and Waterloo, Sydney. He stood for the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] in 1843 but ran last.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sydney Morning Herald]], 23 Jan, 11, 25 Feb, 14 Apr, 14, 16 June, 29 Nov 1843.&lt;/ref&gt;

He established ''Willeroo'' Station on the shore of [[Lake George (New South Wales)|Lake George]], outside of [[Canberra]] [[Australia]], and built  '''[[Juniper Hall, Paddington|Juniper Hall]]''' in [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]]&lt;ref&gt;Mark Dunn,  [http://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/juniper_hall Juniper Hall].&lt;/ref&gt; at the time the largest house in the [[Colony of New South Wales]]. He also commissioned [[Paddington Town Hall]] and founded [[Sydney Grammar School]].

'''Rufus Cutler Dawes''' (July 30, 1867 &amp;ndash; January 8, 1940) was an American businessman in oil and banking from a prominent [[Ohio]] family. He and his three brothers all became nationally known. In the 1920s he served as an expert on the commissions to prepare the [[Dawes Plan]] and the [[Young Plan]] to manage German reparations to the Allies after [[World War I]].

He served as president of the [[Commercial Club of Chicago]], and from 1934-1940, as head of the [[World's Fair]] organization and the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science &amp; Industry]] (MSI). 

==Early life and education==
Dawes was born in [[Marietta, Ohio]], to [[Brigadier General]] [[Rufus R. Dawes]] and Mary Beman (Gates) Dawes. He was a younger brother of [[Charles G. Dawes]] and great-great-grandson of [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] figure [[William Dawes]]. His two younger brothers, [[Beman Gates Dawes]] and [[Henry May Dawes]], also achieved national reputations. His middle name of Cutler is in honor of his paternal grandmother, Sarah Cutler's family (She was a daughter of Ephraim Cutler who was the son of Manasseh Cutler.) &lt;ref&gt;family records&lt;/ref&gt;Cutler was also the name of [[Lysander Cutler]], one of Rufus Dawes' [[American Civil War]] colleagues in the [[Iron Brigade]].

Dawes graduated from [[Marietta College]] with an A.B. in 1886 and A.M. in 1889.

==Marriage and family==
He married Helen B. Palmer on June 3, 1893.

He became involved in public service in 1918, when he was appointed to serve on the [[Illinois]] State Pension Laws Commission (1918–1919). In 1920, he was selected as a delegate to the Illinois constitutional convention.  

His brother Charles appointed him to serve on the experts commission preparing the [[Dawes Plan]] in 1924, to settle an international crisis in Europe and develop a staggered plan for Germany to pay its reparations.  Because of his contribution, Dawes was also asked to work as assistant to [[Owen D. Young]], who developed the succeeding [[Young Plan]] in 1929.  

Dawes was a member of the [[Commercial Club of Chicago]], serving as president in 1925-26.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commercialclubchicago.org/organization/past-members.html Commercial Club : Organization&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was president of [[Century of Progress|A Century of Progress]] Corporation from 1927 until his death in 1940.  

From 1934 until his death, Dawes was concurrently president of the [[World's Fair]] organization and the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science &amp; Industry]] (MSI). Dawes was the third president of the MSI, after [[Sewell Avery]] and [[William Rufus Abbott]]. Previously, he had been an active member of the Board of Trustees, helping to brief [[Waldemar Kaempffert]] when the latter became the first Executive Director of the Museum of Science &amp; Industry in 1928. (Kaempffert was the ''[[New York Times]]'' science editor and served again after his time at the museum.)

'''St. Paul's Protestant Episcopal Church''', more commonly called '''Old St. Paul's Church''' today, is a historic [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church located at 233 [[Charles Street (Baltimore)|North Charles Street]] at the southeast corner with East Saratoga Street, in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], ([[United States]]) near "Cathedral Hill" on the northern edge of the downtown central business district to the south and the [[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon-Belevedere]] cultural/historic neighborhood to the north. It was founded in 1692 as the parish church for the '''"Patapsco Parish"''', one of the [[List of the original 30 Anglican parishes in the Province of Maryland|"original 30 parishes"]] of the old [[Church of England]] in colonial Maryland (now part of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church, U.S.A.]] and the [[Anglican Communion]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anglican Maryland, 1692-1792|last=Middleton|first=Arthur Pierce|year=1992|isbn=0-89865-841-1|publisher=Walsworth Pub Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

St. Paul's was founded in 1692 under the Establishment Act, by the [[Maryland General Assembly|General Assembly of Maryland]] under [[Lionel Copley]], then the colonial/provincial [[Governor of Maryland]], in the [[Province of Maryland]] under the Lord Proprietorship of the [[Baron Baltimore|Lords Baltimore]], which created [[List of the original 30 Anglican parishes in the Province of Maryland|30 "Protestant" (Anglican) parishes in the colony of Maryland]].  The first church as "Patapsco Parish" was located somewhere along near the head of [[Colgate Creek (Maryland)|Colgate Creek]], on the north shore of the [[Patapsco River]] and "Patapsco Neck" peninsula which juts into the [[Chesapeake Bay]] at [[North Point]] and [[Sparrows Point]] between the [[Patapsco River]] to the south and [[Back River (Maryland)]] to the north. Modern-day  [[Highlandtown, Baltimore|Highlandtown]] and [[Canton, Baltimore|Canton]] in southeastern Baltimore City and [[Dundalk, Maryland|Dundalk]], [[Edgemere, Maryland|Edgemere]], and [[Fort Howard (Maryland)|Fort Howard]] are in suburban communities in southeastern [[Baltimore County]] there now.  When Baltimore Town was founded in its present location in 1729/1730, the parish moved to "Lot 19," in the Original Survey" of 1730 at the highest point just inside the original town boundaries on the north end which were purchased from [[Charles Carroll of Annapolis]], (1702-1782), (father of nationally famous [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]], (1732-1832), later longest living signer of [[Declaration of Independence]], only [[Roman Catholic]] to do so, and wealthiest man in America). Here a small brick church, (facing south towards the harbor), a rectory and some cemetery plots were placed in 1739 on a cliff overlooking the [[Jones Falls]] stream (which divided the town from adjacent [[Jonestown, Baltimore|Jonestown]] to the east and [[Fells Point, Baltimore|Fells Point]] to the southeast waterfront) and northwest of the original Courthouse Square (later became [[Battle Monument]] Square after its construction, 1815-1822) at [[Calvert Street (Baltimore)|North Calvert]] between East Lexington and Fayette Streets.  The present "Old Saint Paul's Church (as it is generally known throughout the state) is located now on a portion of that property, in the northwest corner of the original platted lot of 1730.

A second brick church, also built facing south towards "The Basin" ([[Inner Harbor]]) was also constructed of brick and completed in 1784 and consecrated by [[Thomas John Claggett|Bishop Thomas John Claggett]], first [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] Bishop of Maryland (consecrated/ordained 1792) in 1797 (also the year of Baltimore Town's incorporation into a City)  and endured on the site until 1812 when replaced by the [[Robert Cary Long, Jr.|Long-designed]] edifice. The second church continued to use the former steeple of the first church building as a private prayer chapel where it was relocated in the middle of the surrounding cemetery to the north and west along the sloping hill along future East Saratoga Street and [[St. Paul Street (Baltimore)|Saint Paul Lane/Street]].  Gravestones, bodies and coffins, along with other cemetery material were relocated in 1800 to the western side of town at a new plot and cemetery at West Lombard and Fremont Streets, near the present Martin Luther King, Jr.  Boulevard, (which curves around the west-side of downtown) and southwest of the multi-blocks campus of the downtown [[University of Maryland, Baltimore|University of Maryland at Baltimore]]. Construction of King Boulevard in the late 1970s required that a portion of the historic cemetery on its western side was taken for road and sidewalk use and the ancient plots and stone wall were moved slightly eastward and reconstructed. Numerous [[American Revolutionary War]], [[War of 1812]] officers and soldiers are buried here, along with an unusually large number of Baltimore and Maryland civic, business and commercial leaders from early history are resting quietly, with only occasional family/descendents visitors and annual ceremonies by patriotic, military and ancestral heritage associations on various holidays take place.

All Episcopal parishes in Baltimore City and many in [[Baltimore County]] (along with [[Harford County, Maryland|Harford]], [[Cecil County, Maryland|Cecil]], [[Kent County, Maryland|Kent]], and [[Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll Counties]], which were formerly part of old original Baltimore County in the 17th and early 18th Centuries)  are in some way traced to Old St. Paul's Church.  The first "daughter" congregation, Christ Church (closed 1986), was created in 1796 near the present day [[War Memorial Plaza|War Memorial/City Hall Plaza]] at the southwest corner of South Gay and East Fayette Streets. This building was later transferred to another Episcopal parish named Messiah which remained here until burned in the [[Great Baltimore Fire]] of 1904. Christ Episcopal congregation then moved to the northwest corner of [[St. Paul Street (Baltimore)|St. Paul]] and East Chase Streets, where the building is now used by a fundamentalist Protestant congregation.  Another congregation, St. Peter's, was created in an evangelical controversy resulting in a split from Old St. Paul's in 1801 during the rectorate of Rev. Dr. [[Joseph Bend]]; that congregation is known today known as [[Grace and St. Peter's|Grace and St. Peter's Church]], located at Park Avenue and West Monument Street, two blocks west of the [[Washington Monument (Baltimore)|Washington Monument]], across the street from the former brownstone mansion which served as Diocesan House (bishop's and administrative staff offices) in the [[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon-Belvedere]] neighborhood, further northwest.  Grace and St. Peter's Parish has now evolved into a high church "[[Anglo-Catholic]]" parish, with a very well-regarded co-educational private day school.

The third building in Baltimore City (and fourth of the parish in its history) erected for St. Paul's was designed by noted Baltimore architect [[Robert Cary Long, Jr.]], (1810-1849), and constructed in 1812 (some sources say 1814-1817).  This neo-classical structure faced towards the west on [[Charles Street (Baltimore)|Charles Street]], seated 1,600 people in the main level and galleries and was graced with a 126 foot high spire.  The three orders of Greek columns adorned the building.  It was destroyed by fire in 1854; the cross that fell from that tower now adorns the old Church Home Hospital on Broadway in Baltimore.  The fourth church was completed two years later.

The 1856 building reflected the growing influence of the [[Oxford Movement]] in the Episcopal Church.  [[Richard Upjohn]]'s design for the new building invoked not the democratic values of the Federal Period but the Catholicism of Italy, which he had recently toured.  He also had just designed the famous Gothic [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]] on [[Wall Street]] in lower [[New York, New York|New York City]]  Since the existing walls of St. Paul's did not allow for the pointed-gothic design preferred by the [[Ecclesiological Society]], Upjohn patterned the building after the Basilica of San Giorgio in Rome.  The side galleries so important to preaching were not rebuilt, and focus in the building was dramatically pointed to the altar with a spacious (for the time) chancel.

Thus the "high church" position that St. Paul's had occupied since the rectorate of Dr. Bend became more pronounced, especially under the rectorate of Dr. William Wyatt, who oversaw the construction of the new building and the creation of a number of Anglo-Catholic mission parishes around Baltimore City, most notably [[Mount Calvary Church]].  His successor, Rev'd. Milo Mahan, introduced candles on the altar and seasonal liturgical colors.

Two rectors of Old St. Paul's have gone on to become bishops of the [[Episcopal Diocese of Maryland]]: The Right Rev. [[James Kemp (Bishop of Maryland)|James Kemp]] (1764-1827) and the Right Rev. [[Harry Lee Doll]], (1903-1984).

For many years St. Paul's held the distinction of having the finest liturgical music in the city.  In 1873, the Rev. John Sebastian Bach Hodges replaced the church's paid quartet with a professional Choir of Men and Boys, which sang continuously for 141 years.  In 2002 a Choir of Girls was created during the rectorship of the Rev. David Cobb, as a complementary ensemble.  A mixed adult choir (volunteers plus professionals), formed under the leadership of the Rev. Mark Stanley, now sings for the primary Sunday service.  Noted former Organist/Choirmasters of Old St. Paul's include Rodney Hansen, Daniel Fortune, [[Jeremy Filsell]], [[Diane Meredith Belcher]], and Douglas Buchanan.

==Architecture and design==
[[File:St. Paul's Church Baltimore.jpg|right|thumb|The aerial view]]
The present church was designed by renowned architect [[Richard Upjohn]], with an eclectic juxtaposition of 12th-century Italian elements on the exterior and Romanesque elements on the interior.  The exterior facade features two bas-reliefs of Christ and Moses, executed by the Italian sculptor [[Antonio Capellano]] (who also sculpted the statue on the top of the [[Battle Monument]]) that were originally part of the façade of the previous Robert Cary Long church. Other elements from the 1817 structure include the walls of the Federal period building, a stained glass window of the risen Christ over the entrance, a marble baptismal font designed by [[Maximilian Godefroy]] (who also designed the [[Battle Monument]] and the [[First Unitarian Church (Baltimore, Maryland)|First Unitarian Church]]), and the Bishop's chair given to St. Paul's in 1815.

The church was given a relatively dark Victorian appearance when opened.  The Greek columns were painted a sandstone orange, with an elaborate color scheme of brown, red, and yellow ochres dominating the rest of the nave.  The chancel was dominated by a black walnut [[reredos]].  A small stained-glass window of St. Paul stood above the high altar.  English [[Mintons|Minton]] tiles adorned the aisles and chancel that complimented the color scheme of the church.  An anonymous painting of this interior is still in the possession of the parish.

In 1903, the chancel was renovated to a brighter appearance, in accordance with the tastes of the period.  The reredos was moved to the back of the church (where it still stands as a memorial wall), and a new Tiffany reredos was installed with a completely new design for the east wall, including a large chancel window by [[Helen Maitland Armstrong]] was installed above the altar, with the St. Paul window moved to the south aisle.  The ochres of the 1850s gave way to white faux blocks etched into the nave.

The oldest of the aisle windows date to 1890, but most were installed at the same time as the chancel redecoration.  The designers include [[Tiffany Studios]] of New York City and [[Clayton &amp; Bell Studios]].

In the 1930s, the faux blocking was removed, leaving only tracery around the windows.  The chancel was renovated for cleaning and maintenance in the 1990s.  In the summer of 2013, the interior of the church underwent a historic restoration that included painting the nave and adding a blue field with gold stars to the ceiling.

==Noted members==

Prominent members of the parish include [[Samuel Chase]], [[John Eager Howard]], [[Thomas Johnson (jurist)|Thomas Johnson]], and [[William Donald Schaefer]] (mayor of Baltimore and governor, comptroller of Maryland).&lt;ref name="mht_ihp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mht.maryland.gov/secure/medusa/PDF/NR_PDFs/NR-143.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: St. Paul's Protestant Episcopal Church|date=July 1972|accessdate=2016-03-01 |author=Catharine F.

'''''Think and Grow Rich''''' was written in 1937 by [[Napoleon Hill]], promoted as a [[personal development]] and [[self-improvement]] book. Hill writes that he was inspired by a suggestion from [[business magnate]] and later-[[philanthropist]] [[Andrew Carnegie]].&lt;ref&gt;Briley, Richard Gaylord, 1995, ''The Seven Spiritual Secrets Of Success'', p. 151, Thomas Nelson Publishers, {{ISBN|0-7852-8083-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While the book's title and much of the text concerns increasing income, the author insists that his philosophy can help people succeed in any line of work, to do and be anything they can imagine.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Napoleon, 1960, Think and Grow Rich. [Revised Edition, p. 19], Fawcett Books, New York, {{ISBN|0-449-21492-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; First published during the [[Great Depression]],&lt;ref name=lifetime/&gt; the book by Hill's death in 1970 had sold more than 20 million copies. By 2015 more than 100 million copies had been sold worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Think and Grow Rich |url=http://www.naphill.org/shop/books/think-and-grow-rich/ |date=2015 |publisher=Napoleon Hill Foundation |accessdate=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IZtRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KhEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1457%2C1795947 AP, November 10, 1970, 'Grow Rich' Author Dies]&lt;/ref&gt; 

It remains the biggest seller of Napoleon Hill's books. ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' magazine's Best-Seller List ranked it the sixth best-selling paperback business book 70 years after it was published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/pdfs/2007/0703_bestsell.pdf ''The BusinessWeek Best-Seller List,'' BusinessWeek magazine, January 15, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Think and Grow Rich'' is listed in [[John C. Maxwell]]'s ''A Lifetime "Must Read" Books List.'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.envole.net/doc/j/m/jm-lifetimebooklist.pdf Maxwell, John ''A Lifetime "Must Read" Books List,'' March 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

''Think and Grow Rich'' is based on Hill's earlier work ''[[The Law of Success]]'', said to be the result of more than twenty years of study of many individuals who had amassed personal fortunes.&lt;ref name=lifetime&gt;''A Lifetime of Riches: The Biography of Napoleon Hill'', Michael J. Ritt and Kirk Landers (Revised Edition 1995) ({{ISBN|0-525-94146-0}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Hill studied their habits and drew some 16 "laws" to be applied to achieve success. ''Think and Grow Rich'' condenses them, providing the reader with 13 principles in the form of a "Philosophy of Achievement".&lt;ref name=lifetime/&gt; [[Mark Victor Hansen|Mark Hansen]] has said time has shown that two of the laws/principles are most important: 1) The MasterMind principle/process and 2) "Know very clearly where you want to go."

The book asserts that desire, faith, and persistence can propel one to great heights if one can suppress negative thoughts and focus on long-term goals.

The 13 "steps" listed in the book are:
# Desire
# Faith
# Autosuggestion
# Specialized Knowledge
# Imagination
# Organized Planning
# Decision
# Persistence
# Power of the Master Mind
# The Mystery of Sex Transmutation
# The Subconscious Mind
# The Brain
# The Sixth Sense 

There are several courses created from the ''Think and Grow Rich'' content and principles. Earl Nightingale co-created with Napoleon Hill a 30-minute audio summary of the book, titled "Think and Grow Rich: Instant Motivator".

Born in [[Thurles]], [[County Tipperary]], Ryan worked for [[Aer Lingus]], before going on to found their aircraft leasing arm, [[wet lease|wet-leasing]] out their aircraft in the quieter winter months.

In 1975, with Aer Lingus and the Guinness Peat Group, he founded Guinness Peat Aviation (later GPA Group), an aircraft leasing company, with a $50,000 investment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ria.ie/news/tony-ryan-wizard-skies|title=Tony Ryan: wizard of the skies|date=2016-07-15|work=Royal Irish Academy|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; GPA grew to be the world's biggest aircraft lessor, worth $4 billion at its peak. But its value dramatically collapsed in 1992 after the cancellation of its planned [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/gpa-soared-before-crashlanding-26130164.html|title=GPA soared before crash-landing - Independent.ie|work=Independent.ie|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan made €55m from the sale of [[AerFi]] (the successor to GPA) in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/tony-ryan-to-pocket-47m-as-former-gpa-sold-off-26109868.html|title=Tony Ryan to pocket $47m as former GPA sold off - Independent.ie|work=Independent.ie|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan was a [[tax exile]] who lived in [[Monte Carlo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/04/business/04ryan.html|title=Tony Ryan, Who Founded Discount Airline, Dies at 71|last=News|first=Bloomberg|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but also owned a [[stud farm]] near his home in Dolla [[County Tipperary]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was the 7th wealthiest individual from Ireland in the [[Sunday Times Rich List 2007]] with over €1.5bn(£1bn).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/declan-and-shane-ryan-and-family-s02k27g2hrk|title=Declan and Shane Ryan and family|date=2008-04-27|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en|issn=0956-1382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryan over the years helped nurture two successful business protégés – [[Denis O'Brien]] and [[Michael O'Leary (Ryanair)|Michael O'Leary]] – both of whom became billionaires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Independent Woman |url=http://www.independent.ie/business/rich-list/irelands-rich-list-3140-2116348.html |title=Ireland's Rich List: 31–40 |work=The Irish Independent }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also funded The Ryan Academy for Entrepreneurship at the [[Citywest]] park, that is run by [[Dublin City University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ryanacademy.ie/about-us/|title=About Us - Ryan Academy|work=Ryan Academy|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/News/Archives/2005/Taoiseach's_Speeches_Archive_2005/Official_Opening_of_the_Tony_Ryan_Academy_for_Entrepreneurship_at_the_Citywest_Business_Park_on_Monday,_24_October,_2005.html|title=Official Opening of the Tony Ryan Academy for Entrepreneurship at the Citywest Business Park on Monday, 24 October, 2005|last=Colley|first=Elaine|website=www.taoiseach.gov.ie|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Ryan acquired [[Castleton Farm]] near [[Lexington, Kentucky]] from the Van Lennep Family Trust.

He cited the increase in exposure and skill level as his reason for transferring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/kevin_armstrong/02/26/tristan.thompson/index.html | work=CNN | title=Canadian prospects searching for more exposure at American schools | date=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson spent his sophomore and half his junior year at St. Benedict's, making an immediate impact and showing flashes of brilliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.draftexpress.com/article/Top-High-School-Prospects-at-the-2007-City-of-Palms-Classic-2421 |title=Top High School Prospects at the 2007 City of Palms Classic |publisher=DraftExpress |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his short time there, he shot through the ranks to super-stardom, becoming the top recruit in the nation entering his junior season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball.ca/en/hm/inside.php?sid=1&amp;id=2336 |title=Canada Basketball |publisher=Basketball.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nation's top basketball programs heavily sought Thompson, who made the first verbal commitment of the class of 2010 to [[Rick Barnes]] and the [[Texas Longhorns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://grassrootsballin.wordpress.com/2008/03/04/tristan-thompson-st-benedicts-nj-class-of-2010-picks-texas |title=Tristan Thompson (St. Benedict’s, NJ) Class of 2010 Picks Texas « Grassrootsballin |publisher=Grassrootsballin.wordpress.com |date=2008-03-04 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-one games into his junior year, the relationship between Thompson and then-St. Benedict's coach [[Dan Hurley]] hit a rough patch. Hurley's in-your-face, no-holds-barred coaching style took a toll on the young star. During a game against then-top-ranked [[Mater Dei High School (Santa Ana, California)|Mater Dei]], Hurley confronted Thompson during a time out. A heated debate ensued, and Thompson was sent off the court and later removed from the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aristide Economopoulos/The Star-Ledger |url=http://blog.nj.com/hssportsextra/2009/02/texas_recruit_tristan_thompson.html |title=Texas recruit Tristan Thompson kicked off St. Benedict's boys basketball team &amp;#124; NJ.com |publisher=Blog.nj.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the next few days he made it known that he was planning to leave, resulting in a barrage of calls from top prep schools throughout North America trying to acquire his services. The next week he transferred to [[Findlay Prep]] with his close friend and [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] teammate [[Cory Joseph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simmons |first=Steve |url=http://www.torontosun.com/sports/columnists/steve_simmons/2009/02/13/8375606-sun.html |title='Insulting' treatment &amp;#124; Columnists &amp;#124; Opinion |publisher=Toronto Sun |date=2009-02-13 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetexas.com/news/story.php?article=838 |title=Tristan Thompson {{sic|nolink=y|Transfering}} to Finlay Prep |publisher=InsideTexas.com |date=2012-11-02 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson joined Findlay on the back end of their schedule, making an immediate impact on the team and thriving under Findlay coach Michael Peck's system and coaching style. Thompson solidified his top recruit status and helped lead Findlay to their first National Championship. He continued to round and polish his skills his senior year in preparation for college and held fast to his commitment to the University of Texas, officially signing his letter of intent on November 11, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texassports.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/111109aaa.html |title=Men's Basketball signs Tristan Thompson to National Letter of Intent – TexasSports.com – Official website of University of Texas Athletics – Texas Longhorns |publisher=TexasSports.com |date=2009-11-11 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson then led his team to another National Championship at the ESPN National High School Invitational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Findlay Prep Repeats at the Second Annual ESPN RISE National High School Invitational – Corey Joseph MVP|date=April 3, 2010|work=espnmediazone3.com|url=http://www.espnmediazone3.com/us/2010/04/findlay-prep-repeats-at-the-second-annual-espn-rise-national-high-school-invitational-–-corey-joseph-mvp/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111074400/http://www.espnmediazone3.com/us/2010/04/findlay-prep-repeats-at-the-second-annual-espn-rise-national-high-school-invitational-%E2%80%93-corey-joseph-mvp/|archivedate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their senior year, Thompson and Joseph both committed to Texas and were the fourth and fifth Canadians to be named [[McDonald's All-American]]s, after [[Bill Wennington]] (1981), [[Barry Bekkedam]] (1986) and [[Olu Famutimi]] (2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcdonaldsallamerican.com/2012/Boy's%20Alumni%20-%202011.xls |title=Every SuperStar Starts with a Nomination |publisher=Mcdonaldsallamerican.com |date=2010-07-22 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson was also named a [[Jordan Brand Classic]] All-American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nike.com/jumpman23/classic/2010roster.html |title=Jordan Brand All-American Classic |publisher=Nike.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College career==
Thompson averaged 13.1 points and 7.8 rebounds per game for the Texas Longhorns in 2010–11 as he won the team's Most Valuable Player award, as voted on by his teammates. Nationally, Thompson was one of five finalists for the Wayman Tisdale Award, an honor given to the National Freshman of the Year by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association. Thompson won the Big 12 Freshman of the Year honours as well as first-team NABC All-District 8 and USBWA All-District VII honours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texassports.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/031011aac.html |title=Trio of Longhorns Earn USBWA All-District VII Honors – TexasSports.com – Official website of University of Texas Athletics – Texas Longhorns |publisher=TexasSports.com |date=2011-03-10 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He led the team in rebounding, blocked shots (86), double-doubles (10) and field goal percentage (.546) while ranking second in scoring. He helped Texas conclude the 2010–11 season with a 28–8 record and advanced to the NCAA Tournament Round of 32. The Longhorns finished No. 8 in the final AP poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rainmennbl.blogspot.com.au/2012/07/history-and-future-of-basketball-in.html|title=History and Future of Basketball in Canada|work=RainmenNBL.blogspot.com.au|date=July 26, 2011|accessdate=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson told media after the NCAA tournament that he planned to return to Texas for his sophomore season but changed his mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/tournament/2011/news/story?id=6236917|title=Texas' Tristan Thompson to return|publisher=ESPN|date=March 19, 2011|accessdate=March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 21, 2011, he declared for the [[NBA draft]], forgoing his three years of college eligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readthehorn.com/sports/4097/report_thompson_will_declare_for_nba_draft|title=Report: Tristan Thompson will declare for NBA draft|work=ReadTheHorn.com|date=April 21, 2011|accessdate=April 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==

===NBA draft===
On June 23, 2011, Thompson was drafted fourth overall in the [[2011 NBA draft]] by the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]. At the time, he was the highest drafted Canadian-born player in NBA history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolstat |first=Ryan |url=http://www.winnipegsun.com/2011/06/23/thompson-makes-canadian-nba-history |title=Thompson makes Canadian NBA history &amp;#124; Basketball &amp;#124; Sports |publisher=Winnipeg Sun |date=2011-06-23 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was until [[Anthony Bennett (basketball)|Anthony Bennett]] and [[Andrew Wiggins]] were selected with the first overall pick in [[2013 NBA draft|2013]] and [[2014 NBA draft|2014]], respectively. Thompson continued to make history, drafted alongside Joseph, who was picked 29th by the [[San Antonio Spurs]], one of only two occasions in NBA history that two Canadians were selected in the first round of the same draft, the other being in 1983 when [[Leo Rautins]] and [[Stewart Granger (basketball)|Stewart Granger]] were selected 17th and 25th respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1983.html |title=1983 NBA Draft |publisher=Basketball-Reference.com |date=1983-06-28 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 draft was also the first time three Texas Longhorn basketball players went in the first round of a draft, when Thompson's former collegiate teammate [[Jordan Hamilton]] went 26th overall to the [[Dallas Mavericks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://basketball.ca/en/hm/inside.php?id=5117 |title=Canada Basketball |publisher=Basketball.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kate Hairopoulos |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/college-sports/headlines/20110624-orange-rush-3-horns-taken-in-nba-draft_s-1st-round-for-first-time.ece |title=Orange rush: 3 Horns taken in NBA draft's 1st round for first time &amp;#124; Dallas-Fort Worth College Sports News – Sports News for Dallas, Texas – SportsDayDFW |publisher=Dallasnews.com |date=2011-06-24 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleveland Cavaliers (2011–present)===

====2011–12 season: Rookie season====
During the [[2011 NBA lockout]], Thompson attended classes at the University of Texas to finish his college degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tommy Alter |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/basketball/nba/07/28/rookies.lockout/index.html |title=Rookie Tristan Thompson, guard Stephen Curry endure lockout effects – NBA – SI.com |work=Sports Illustrated|date=July 28, 2011 |accessdate=November 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson signed his rookie contract with the Cavaliers on December 9, 2011 before the start of training camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Northeast Ohio |url=http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2011/12/cleveland_cavaliers_sign_irvin.html |title=Cleveland Cavaliers sign Irving, Thompson to rookie deals |publisher=cleveland.com |accessdate=November 6, 2012|date=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson made his professional debut against his hometown [[Toronto Raptors]] on December 26, 2011. In 17 minutes off the bench, Thompson scored 12 points and pulled in 5 rebounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolstat |first=Ryan |url=http://www.torontosun.com/2011/12/26/canadian-thompson-has-strong-nba-debut |title=Canadian Thompson has strong NBA debut &amp;#124; Basketball &amp;#124; Sports |publisher=Toronto Sun |date=2011-12-26 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson came off the bench behind veteran forwards [[Antawn Jamison]] and [[Anderson Varejão]] for the first three months of his rookie season but still managed to make his presence known on both ends of the court. His production increased in February as his minutes increased, and he recorded three double-doubles that month. His best performance in February was a 15-point, 12-rebound, two-block effort in 30 minutes of play as the Cavaliers defeated Sacramento 93-92. Both Thompson and teammate [[Kyrie Irving]] were later named to the 2012 Rising Stars Challenge. However, Thompson was selected to play for Team [[Shaquille O'Neal|Shaq]], while Irving was selected by Team [[Charles Barkley|Chuck]].

Thompson was inserted into the starting lineup on March 18 against Atlanta as Varejao continued to recover from a fractured wrist. He recorded seven points and six rebounds. The turning point of his season came in the following game against New Jersey, when he posted a 27-point, 12-rebound performance in a 105-100 road win. After Varejao was ruled out indefinitely, head coach [[Byron Scott (basketball)|Byron Scott]] decided to start Thompson at centre for the remainder of the regular season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rotoworld.com/recent/nba/1852/tristan-thompson |title=Recent news on Tristan Thompson – Cleveland Cavaliers |publisher=Rotoworld.com |date=1991-03-13 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson did not disappoint, upping his averages to 9.3 points, 7.5 rebounds and just under one block per game as a starter. He shone in April even with Cleveland out of the playoff race, scoring in double figures in 10 of his final 16 games and blocking a season-high four shots against Memphis on April 23. He finished the season with averages of 8.2 points and 6.5 rebounds in 60 games as he earned NBA All-Rookie second team honours, becoming the first Canadian to ever earn All-Rookie team honours in the NBA.

====2012–13 season====
In [[2012–13 Cleveland Cavaliers season|2012–13]], Thompson worked on avoiding getting his own shots blocked, and switched his shooting hand from left to right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Valade|first=Jodie|title=Tristan Thompson gets advice from an old pro on avoiding blocks: Cleveland Cavaliers Insider|date=November 29, 2012|newspaper=The Plain Dealer|url=http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2012/11/tristan_thompson_gets_advice_f.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FwwAQMWP|archivedate=April 17, 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the season, almost 17%, or one out of six, of his shots were blocked,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The league average is 6.3% of shots being blocked.&lt;/ref&gt; threatening former NBA player [[Danny Fortson]]'s 16.7% rate in [[1997–98 NBA season|1997–98]]. Thompson dropped to around 15% by season's end, which was only reached by three other players before the season.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Comparison limited to players who attempted at least 500 field goals in a season since 1997, the earliest for which NBA.com has data.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dwyer|first=Kelly|title=Tristan Thompson neared NBA infamy before Zydrunas Ilgauskas taught him how not to get blocked|date=April 17, 2013|work=yahoo.com|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/tristan-thompson-approaching-nba-infamy-zydrunas-ilgauskas-showed-131048180--nba.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Fwwa2hRq|archivedate=April 17, 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to average 3.7 offensive rebounds per game, which ranked fifth in the NBA and first among second year players, and set the Cavaliers franchise record for most offensive rebounds in a single season with 306 (second in the NBA), surpassing [[Zydrunas Ilgauskas]]' 299 offensive rebounds in the 2004–05 season. He also recorded a team-high 31 double-doubles on the season, becoming just the ninth player in franchise history to total at least 30 double-doubles in a single season. He started all 82 games in 2012–13 as he averaged 11.7 points on .488 shooting, 9.4 rebounds and 0.9 blocks in 31.3 minutes per game.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/playerfile/tristan_t_thompson/bio/ |title=Tristan Thompson Stats, Video, Bio, Profile |work=NBA.com |accessdate=December 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013–14 season====
In the 2013 off-season, Thompson decided to switch his shooting hand to his right instead of his left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/8/11/4611888/tristan-thompson-shooting-hands-switch|title=Tristan Thompson will switch shooting hands next season|work=SBNation.com|date=August 11, 2013|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the change, he had an almost identical season for the Cavaliers in 2013–14, as he started all 82 games while averaging 11.7 points and 9.2 rebounds in 31.6 minutes per game. He tied for fifth in the Eastern Conference with a team-leading and career-best 36 double-doubles.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

====2014–15 season====
During the 2014 off-season, the Cavaliers acquired All-Star forwards [[LeBron James]] and [[Kevin Love]]. Thompson came off the bench for most of the season, providing energy and solidifying his place as one of the best offensive rebounders in the league, averaging 8.5 points and 8 rebounds per game. He played in all 82 games and started 15. The Cavaliers finished with a 53-29 record and made the playoffs for the first time since 2010. Early in the first round, Kevin Love dislocated his shoulder and was ruled out for the rest of the post-season. Thompson became the starter after Love's injury and helped the Cavaliers reach the [[2015 NBA Finals]]. The Cavaliers faced the [[Golden State Warriors]], and lost the series in six games. During the playoffs, Thompson emerged as one of the NBA's best rebounders, especially on the offensive glass. He became a [[restricted free agent (NBA)|restricted free agent]] after the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Scott|title=Tristan Thompson turned down an $80 million contract from the Cavs, and 3 months later it looks like a disaster|date=October 17, 2015|work=Business Insider|via=Yahoo.com|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tristan-thompson-turned-down-80-140500082.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cMIj3Dil|archivedate=October 18, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015–16 season: Championship season====
On October 22, 2015, Thompson re-signed with the Cavaliers on a five-year, $82 million contract, ending a four-month contract stalemate that caused Thompson to miss training camp, the preseason, and the [[2015 FIBA Americas Championship|FIBA Americas Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/releases/thompson-signing-2015|title=Cavs Re-Sign Forward Tristan Thompson|work=NBA.com|date=October 22, 2015|accessdate=October 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/13942794/cleveland-cavaliers-tristan-thompson-agree-5-year-82-million-deal|title=Tristan Thompson re-signs with Cavaliers for 5 years, $82 million|publisher=ESPN|date=October 22, 2015|accessdate=October 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/basketball/2015/08/10/tristan-thompson-ruled-out-of-canadas-team-at-olympic-qualifier.html|title=Tristan Thompson ruled out of Canada's team at Olympic qualifier|work=[[Toronto Star]]|date=August 10, 2015|accessdate=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 2015–16 season, Thompson shared the starting center role with [[Timofey Mozgov]].

{{UKtaxation}}
In the '''United Kingdom, corporation tax''' is a [[corporate tax]] levied in the United Kingdom on the [[Profit (economics)|profit]]s made by UK-resident [[Company (law)|companies]] and on the profits of entities registered overseas with [[permanent establishment]]s in the UK. 

Until 1 April 1965, companies were taxed at the same [[Taxation in the United Kingdom#Income tax|income tax rates]] as individual taxpayers, with an additional [[profits tax]] levied on companies. [[Finance Act 1965]]&lt;ref name="FA 65"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Finance+Act+1965&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1171400&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1171400&amp;filesize=108865 | title = Finance Act 1965 (c. 25), from UK Statute Law Database | accessdate =9 May 2007 | publisher = UK Statutory Publications Office, [[Ministry of Justice]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; replaced this structure for companies and associations with a single corporate tax, which took its basic structure and rules from the income tax system. Since 1997, the UK's [[Tax Law Rewrite Project]]&lt;ref name="rewrite"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rewrite/index.htm Tax Law Rewrite] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418073148/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rewrite/index.htm |date=18 April 2006 }}, [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs]] (HMRC). Retrieved 17 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; has been modernising the UK's tax legislation, starting with income tax, while the legislation imposing corporation tax has itself been amended, the rules governing income tax and corporation tax have thus diverged. Corporation tax was governed by the [[Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]] (as amended) prior to the rewrite project.&lt;ref name="ICTA 88"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/1][[Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]] (c. 1), [[Office of Public Sector Information]], responsible for the operation of Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO), {{ISBN|0-10-540188-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Most income tax rules have been rewritten in the [[Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003]], [[Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005]], and [[Income Tax Act 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally introduced as a classical tax system, in which companies were subject to tax on their profits and companies' [[shareholder]]s were also liable to income tax on the [[dividend]]s that they received, the first major amendment to corporation tax saw it move to a [[dividend imputation]] system in 1973, under which an individual receiving a dividend became entitled to an income tax credit representing the corporation tax already paid by the company paying the dividend. The classical system was reintroduced in 1999, with the abolition of [[advance corporation tax]] and of repayable dividend tax credits. Another change saw the single main rate of tax split into three. [[Tax competition]] between jurisdictions reduced the main corporate tax rate from 28% in 2008-2010 to a flat rate of 20% as of April 2015.&lt;ref name="Rates"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Corporation Tax rates and reliefs - GOV.UK|url = https://www.gov.uk/corporation-tax-rates/rates|website = www.gov.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UK government]] faced problems with its corporate tax structure, including [[European Court of Justice]] judgements that aspects of it are incompatible with EU treaties.&lt;ref name="Hoechst"/&gt; [[Tax avoidance]] schemes marketed by the financial sector have also proven an irritant, and been countered by complicated anti-avoidance legislation.

The complexity of the corporation tax system is a recognised issue.  The Labour government, supported by the Opposition parties, carried through wide-scale reform from the Tax Law Rewrite project, resulting in the [[Corporation Tax Act 2010]]. The tax has slowly been integrating [[generally accepted accounting practice]], with the corporation tax system in various specific areas based directly on the accounting treatment.

Total net corporation tax receipts were a record high of £56 billion in 2016-17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/ca3e5bd2-2a7e-11e7-9ec8-168383da43b7 |title=Riddle of UK’s rising corporation tax receipts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:James Callaghan.JPG|thumb|170px|right|[[James Callaghan|Jim Callaghan]], the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] who introduced corporation tax in 1965.]]
Until 1965, companies were subject to income tax on their profits&lt;ref name="CT"&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140109143644/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/corporate_tax/introduction.pdf Corporate Tax (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; at the same rates as was levied on individual taxpayers. A [[dividend imputation]] system existed, whereby the income tax paid by a company was offset against the income tax liability of a shareholder who received dividends from the company. The standard rate of income tax in 1949 was 50%.&lt;ref name="Just Taxes"&gt;{{cite book | last = Daunton | first = Martin | title = Just Taxes: The Politics of Taxation in Britain, 1914–1979|year = 2002| url = http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/14003/sample/9780521814003ws.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate =9 April 2007| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 0-521-81400-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the company paid a £100 dividend, the recipient would be treated as if he had earned £200 and had paid £100 in income tax on it – the tax paid by the company fully covered the tax due from the individual on the dividend paid. If, however, the individual was subject to tax at a higher rate (known as "surtax"), he (not the company) would be liable to pay the additional tax.

In addition to income tax, companies were also subject to a profits tax,&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; which was deducted from company profits when determining the income tax liability. It was a differential tax, with a higher tax rate on [[dividend]]s (profits distributed to shareholders) than on profits retained within the company. By penalising the distribution of profits, it was hoped companies would retain profits for investment, which was considered a priority after the Second World War.&lt;ref name="E&amp;I"/&gt; The tax did not have the desired effect, so the distributed profits tax was increased by 20%&lt;ref name="newark adv."&gt;"[http://www.newarkadvertiser.net/newtiser/history/51apr.htm 50 years ago] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20150309182007/http://www.newarkadvertiser.net/newtiser/history/51apr.htm |date=9 March 2015 }}", ''Newark Advertiser''. Retrieved 8 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Attlee ministry|post-war Labour government]] to encourage companies to retain more of their profits. At the time of [[Hugh Gaitskell]]'s 1951 budget, the profits tax was 50% for distributed profits and 10% for undistributed profits.

A series of reductions in the profits tax were brought in from 1951 onwards by the new Conservative government. The tax rates fell to 22.5% on distributed profits and 2.5% on undistributed profits by 1957, but the profits tax was no longer income tax-deductible. [[Derick Heathcoat-Amory]]'s Budget of March 1958 replaced the differential profits tax with a single profits tax measure, applicable to both retained and distributed profits. This gradual decrease, and final abolition, of taxes on capital distributions reflected ideological differences between the Conservative and Labour parties: the Conservative approach was to distribute profits to capital holders for investment elsewhere, while Labour sought to force companies to retain profits for reinvestment in the company in the hope this would benefit the company's workforce.&lt;ref name="E&amp;I"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.historyandpolicy.org/archive/policy-paper-06.html |title= Equality and incentive: fiscal politics from Gladstone to Brown |author = Daunton, Martin |date=May 2002 |publisher= History &amp; Policy |accessdate =9 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finance Act 1965===
Finance Act 1965&lt;ref name="FA 65"/&gt; replaced the system of income tax and profits tax from 1 April 1965 with the Corporation Tax, which re-introduced aspects of the old system. Corporation Tax was charged at a uniform rate on all profits, but additional tax was then payable if profits were distributed as a dividend to shareholders. In effect, dividends suffered double taxation. This method of corporation tax is known as the classical system and is similar to that used in the United States. The effect of the tax was to revert to the distribution tax in operation from 1949 to 1959: dividend payments were subject to higher tax than profits retained within the company.

Finance Act 1965&lt;ref name="FA 65"/&gt; also introduced a [[capital gains tax]], at a rate of 30%, charged on the gains arising on the disposal of capital assets by individuals. While companies were exempted from capital gains tax, they were liable to corporation tax on their "chargeable gains", which were calculated in substantially the same way as capital gains for individuals. The tax applied to company shares as well as other assets. Before 1965, capital gains were not taxed, and it was advantageous for taxpayers to argue that a receipt was non-taxable "capital" rather than taxable "revenue".

===Advance Corporation Tax===
{{main article|Advance corporation tax}}
The basic structure of the tax, where company profits were taxed as profits, and dividend payments were then taxed as income, remained unchanged until 1973, when a partial imputation system was introduced for dividend payments.&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; Unlike the previous imputation system, the tax credit to the shareholder was less than the corporation tax paid (corporation tax was higher than the standard rate of income tax, but the imputation, or set-off, was only of standard rate tax). When companies made distributions, they also paid the advance corporation tax (known as ACT), which could be set off against the main corporation tax charge, subject to certain limits (the full amount of ACT paid could not be recovered if significantly large amounts of profits were distributed).&lt;ref name="CTM20105"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/ctm20105.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM20105 — ACT: set-off against CT on profits: introduction], HMRC. Retrieved 13 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals and companies who received a dividend from a UK company received a [[tax credit]] representing the ACT paid.&lt;ref name="CTM16120"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/ctm16120.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM16120 — Distributions: impact on CT: franked investment income: general], HMRC.

Retrieved 12 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On introduction, ACT was set at 30% of the gross dividend (the actual amount paid plus the tax credit). If a company made a £70 dividend payment to an individual, the company would pay £30 of advance corporation tax. The shareholder would receive the £70 cash payment, plus a tax credit of £30; thus, the individual would be deemed to have earned £100, and to have already paid tax of £30 on it. The ACT paid by the company would be deductible against its final "mainstream" corporation tax bill. To the extent that the individual's tax on the dividend was less than the tax credit – for example, if his income was too low to pay tax (below £595 in 1973–1974&lt;ref name="Personal allowances"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/tax_structure/incometax_pa-and-reliefs_1974to1990.pdf Income Tax Personal Allowances and Reliefs 1973–74 to 1989–90 (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206074009/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/tax_structure/incometax_pa-and-reliefs_1974to1990.pdf |date=6 February 2007 }}, HMRC. Retrieved 9 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;) – he would be able to reclaim some or all of the £30 tax paid by the company. The set-off was only partial, since the company would pay 52% tax (small companies had lower rates, but still higher than the ACT rate),&lt;ref name="Rates"/&gt; and thus the £70 received by the individual actually represented pre-tax profits of £145.83. Accordingly, only part of the double taxation was relieved.

ACT was not payable on dividends from one UK company to another (unless the payor company elected to pay it).&lt;ref name="CTM20070"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM20070.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM20070 — ACT: general: qualifying and non-qualifying distributions], HMRC.

[[File:Gordon Brown Photo.jpg|thumb|[[Gordon Brown]], the Chancellor of the Exchequer who abolished ACT and introduced the quarterly instalment regime in 1999.]]

The level of ACT was linked to the basic rate of income tax between 1973 and 1993. The March 1993 Budget of [[Norman Lamont (1942)|Norman Lamont]] cut the ACT rate and tax credit to 22.5% from April 1993, and 20% from April 1994.&lt;ref name="Rates"/&gt; These changes were accompanied with a cut of income tax on dividends to 20%, while the basic rate of income tax remained at 25%. Persons liable for tax were lightly affected by the change, because income tax liability was still balanced by the tax credit received, although higher rate tax payers paid an additional 25% tax on the amount of the dividend actually received (net), as against 20% before the change.

The change had bigger effects on pensions and non-taxpayers. A pension fund receiving a £1.2&amp;nbsp;m dividend income prior to the change would have been able to reclaim £400,000 in tax, giving a total income of £1.6&amp;nbsp;m. After the change, only £300,000 was reclaimable, reducing income to £1.5&amp;nbsp;m, a fall of 6.25%.

Despite this, critics such as [[Member of Parliament]] [[Frank Field (UK politician)|Frank Field]] described it as a "hammer blow" and the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' described it as a swindle,&lt;ref name="Pension Swindle"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Field | first = Frank | title = The great pension swindle | publisher = Sunday Times | date = 1 April 2007 | url = http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/Features/Focus/article62480.ece | accessdate =9 May 2007}}{{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the hypothetical £1.5&amp;nbsp;m income described above falling to £1.2&amp;nbsp;m, a fall in income of 20%, because no tax would be reclaimable.

====Abolition of Advance Corporation Tax====
From 6 April 1999 ACT was abolished,&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; and the tax credit on dividends was reduced to 10%.&lt;ref name="Rates"/&gt; There was a matching reduction in the basic income tax rate on dividends to 10%, while a new higher-rate of 32.5% was introduced which led to an overall effective 25% tax rate for higher rate taxpayers on dividends (after setting this "notional" tax credit against the tax liability).While non-taxpayers were no longer able to claim this amount from the treasury (as opposed to taxpayers who could deduct it from their tax bill), the 20% ACT (which would have previously been deducted from the dividend before payment) was no longer levied.

The abolition of ACT was actually one of the biggest tax grabs ever by a Chancellor, as pension companies could no longer recover the tax paid on dividends (along with pensioners and other reliant on the income).  This now costs over £10bn a year and was one of the factors that lead to the death of the final salary pension scheme. (ref:https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/pensions/10798785/True-cost-of-Labours-pension-tax-raid-and-others-since-Seventies.html).  It is one of the biggest tax grabs ever, sold as 'the abolition of a tax'.

ACT that had been incurred prior to 1999 could still be set off against a company's tax liability, provided it would have been able to set it off under the old imputation system.&lt;ref name="CTM18250"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM18250.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM18250 — Shadow ACT: outline of the scheme], HMRC. Retrieved 17 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In order to keep the stream of payments associated with advance corporation tax payment, 'large' companies (comprising the majority of corporation tax receipts) were subjected to a quarterly instalments scheme for tax payment.&lt;ref name="CTM92505"/&gt;

===Rates===
On its introduction in 1965, corporation tax was charged at 40%, rising to 45% in the 1969 [[Budget]]. The rate then fell to 42.5% in the second Budget of 1970 and 40% in 1971. In 1973, alongside the introduction of [[advance corporation tax]] (ACT), Conservative chancellor [[Anthony Barber]] created a main rate of 52%, together with a smaller companies' rate of 42%.&lt;ref name="Rates"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/corporate_tax/rates-of-tax.pdf Rates of Corporation Tax (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609150401/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/corporate_tax/rates-of-tax.pdf |date=9 June 2007 }}, HMRC. Retrieved 13 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This apparent increase was negated by the fact that under the ACT scheme, dividends were no longer subject to income tax.

The 1979 Conservative Budget of [[Geoffrey Howe]] cut the small companies' rate to 40%, followed by a further cut in the 1982 Budget to 38%.&lt;ref name="Rates"/&gt; The Budgets of 1983–1988 saw sharp cuts in both main and small companies' rates, falling to 35% and 25% respectively.&lt;ref name="Rates"/&gt; Budgets between 1988 and 2001 brought further falls to a 30% main rate and 19% small companies' rates.&lt;ref name="Rates"/&gt; From April 1983 to March 1997 the small companies' rate was pegged to the basic rate of [[income tax]].&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; During the 1980s there was briefly a higher rate of tax imposed for capital profits.

===Taxable profits and accounting profits===
The starting point for computing taxable profits is profits before tax (except for a [[life assurance]] company). The rules for calculating corporation tax generally ran in parallel with income tax until 1993, when the first statutory rule to move profit reporting into line with [[generally accepted accounting practice]] was introduced, although the courts were already moving towards requiring trading profits to be computed using general [[accountancy]] rules.&lt;ref name="CTM01130"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM01130.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM01130 — Corporation Tax: introduction: computation of profits], HMRC.

====International Financial Reporting Standards====
From 2005, all [[European Union]] [[listed company|listed companies]] have to prepare their financial statements using the "[[International Financial Reporting Standards]]" ("IFRS"), as modified by the EU.&lt;ref name="IAS"&gt;[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/internal_market/single_market_services/financial_services_general_framework/l26040_en.htm International accounting standards (IAS)], www.europa.eu. Retrieved 13 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Other UK companies may choose to adopt IFRS. Corporation tax law is changing so that, in the future, IFRS accounting profits are largely respected. The exception is for certain financial instruments and certain other measures to prevent tax [[arbitrage]] between companies applying IFRS and companies applying UK GAAP.

===Avoidance===
[[Tax avoidance]] is the legitimate reduction of tax through tax planning and/or usage of legal provisions. Unlike most other countries, most UK tax professionals are accountants rather than lawyers by training.

Until 2013, the UK had no [[tax avoidance|general anti-avoidance rule]] ("GAAR") for corporation tax. However, it inherited an anti-avoidance rule from income tax relating to transactions in securities,&lt;ref name="CTM36805"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM36805.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM36805 — Particular topics: transactions in securities: tax advantage from: introduction], HMRC. Retrieved 19 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and since then has had various "mini-GAARs" added to it. The best known "mini-GAAR" prevents a deduction for interest paid when the loan to which it relates is made for an "unallowable purpose".&lt;ref name="CTM56705"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM56705.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM56705 — Loan relationships: miscellaneous: for unallowable purposes: general] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111113054/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM56705.htm |date=11 January 2007 }}, HMRC.

Finance Act 2004&lt;ref name="FA 2004"/&gt; introduced disclosure rules requiring promoters of certain tax avoidance schemes that are financing- or employment-related to disclose the scheme. Taxpayers who use these schemes must also disclose their use when they submit their tax returns.&lt;ref name="Tax Avoid"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/aiu/index.htm Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes], HMRC.

===Need for greater revenues===
In the early twenty-first century the government sought to raise more revenues from corporation tax. In 2002 it introduced a separate 10% supplementary charge on profits from oil and gas extraction businesses,&lt;ref name="OT00190"/&gt; and Finance Act 2005&lt;ref name="FA 2005"/&gt; contained measures to accelerate when oil and gas extraction business have to pay tax. Instead of paying their tax in four equal instalments in the seventh, tenth, thirteenth and sixteenth month after the accounting period starts, they will be required to consolidate their third and fourth payments and pay them in the thirteenth month, creating a [[cash flow]] advantage for the government.Finance (No.2) Act 2005&lt;ref name="FA (No2) 2005"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/22 Finance (No.2) Act 2005], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-10-542205-3}} Retrieved on 9 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; continued measures specifically relating to [[life assurance]] companies. When originally announced (as Finance (No.3) Bill 2005) [[Legal &amp; General]] told the Stock Exchange that £300&amp;nbsp;m had been wiped off its value, and Aviva (Norwich Union) announced that the tax changes would cost its policy holders £150&amp;nbsp;m.

==Method of charge==
Powers to collect corporation tax must be passed annually by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]], otherwise there is no authority to collect it. The charge for the [[Fiscal year|financial year]] (beginning 1 April each year) is imposed by successive finance acts. The tax is charged in respect of the company's [[accounting period]], which is normally the 12-month period for which the company prepares its [[financial statements|accounts]].&lt;ref name="CTM01105"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM01105.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM01105 — Corporation Tax: introduction: basis of charge to CT], HMRC.

Corporation tax is levied on the net profits of a company.&lt;ref name="CTM01105"/&gt; Except for certain [[life assurance]] companies,&lt;ref name="CTM40325"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM40325.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM40325 — Particular bodies: friendly societies: exemption for life or endowment business], HMRC. Retrieved 14 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; it is borne by the company as a [[direct tax]].

Up until 1999 no corporation tax was due unless HMRC raised an assessment on a company. Companies were, however, obliged to report certain details to HMRC so that the right amount could be assessed. This changed for accounting periods ending on or after 1 July 1999, when self-assessment was introduced.&lt;ref name="FA 98"/&gt; Self-assessment means that companies are required to assess themselves ''and take full responsibility for that assessment''. If the self-assessment is wrong through negligence or recklessness, the company can be liable to penalties.&lt;ref name="CTM93260"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM93260.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM93260 — CTSA: the filing obligation: unsatisfactory return], HMRC.

The self-assessment tax return needs to be delivered to HMRC 12 months after the end of the period of account in which the accounting period falls&lt;ref name="CTM93030"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM93030.htm Corporation Tax Manual CTM93030 — CTSA: the filing obligation: filing date: definition], HMRC. Retrieved 14 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; (although the tax must be paid before this date). If a company fails to submit a return by then, it is liable to penalties.&lt;ref name="CTM93260"/&gt; HMRC may then issue a determination of the tax payable,&lt;ref name="CTM95305"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM95305.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM95305 — CTSA: Revenue determination: power to make], HMRC.

Also, the most common claims and elections that may be made by a company have to be part of its tax return, with a time limit of two years after the end of the accounting period.&lt;ref name="CTM90602"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM90602.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM90602 — CTSA: claims and elections: introduction], HMRC. Retrieved 15 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This means that a company submitting its return more than one year late suffers not only from the late filing penalties, but also from the inability to make these claims and elections.

From 2004 there has been a requirement for new companies to notify HM Revenue &amp; Customs of their [[Company Formation|formation]], although HMRC receives notifications of new company registrations from [[Companies House]].&lt;ref name="FA 2004"/&gt; Companies will then receive an annual notice CT603, approximately 1–2 months after the end of the company's financial period, notifying it to complete an annual return. This must also include the company's annual accounts, and possibly other documents, such as [[auditor]]s' reports, that are required for certain companies.&lt;ref name="CTM93090"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM93090.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM93090 — CTSA: the filing obligation: delivery of return: content], HMRC.

===Schedular system===
{{Main|Schedular system of taxation}}

In the United Kingdom the ''source rule'' applies. This means that something is taxed only if there is a specific provision bringing it within the charge to tax. Accordingly, profits are only charged to corporation tax if they fall within one of the following, and are not otherwise exempted by an explicit provision of the Taxes Acts:&lt;ref name="CTM01105"/&gt;

Notes:
#Cases II and IV only apply to income tax and not corporation tax.

Strictly speaking, Corporation Tax Act 2010 replaces the historic terminology "Schedule A", "Schedule D Case I" etc. with more descriptive terms but this does not affect the substantive application of the schedular system so that, for example, different rules apply for utilising tax losses depending upon the nature of the income under which the losses arises.

====Relief for expenses====
Most direct expenses are deductible when calculating taxable income and chargeable gains. Notable exceptions include any costs of entertaining clients. Companies with investment business may deduct certain indirect expenses known as "expenses of management" when calculating their taxable profits. A similar relief is available for expenses of a [[life assurance]] company taxed on the [[I minus E basis]] which relate to the company's [[basic life assurance and general annuity business]].&lt;ref name="CTM08005"/&gt; Donations made to charities are also normally deducted in calculating taxable income if made under [[Gift Aid]].&lt;ref name="CTM09060"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM09060.htm Corporate Taxation Manual CTM09060 — Corporation Tax: charges on income: Gift Aid], HMRC.

Where a company's [[accounting period]] straddles a financial year in which the corporation tax rate has changed, the company's profits for that period are split.&lt;ref name="CTM010405"/&gt; For example, a company paying small companies' rate with its accounting period running from 1 January to 31 December, and making £100,000 of profit in 2007, would be deemed to have made 90/365*£100,000 = £24,657.53 in FY06 (there are 90 days between 1 January and 31 March), and 275/365*£100,000=£75,34.47 in FY07, and would pay 19% on the FY06 portion, and 20% on the FY07 portion.

===HM Revenue and Customs powers of enquiry===
HMRC has one year from the normal filing date, which is itself one year after the end of the [[period of account]], to open an enquiry into the return. This period is extended if the return is filed late. The enquiry continues until all issues that HMRC wish to enquire about a return are dealt with. However, a company can appeal to the Commissioners of Income Tax to close an enquiry if they feel there is undue delay.&lt;ref name="CTM90150"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM90150.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM90150 — CTSA: introduction: key features], HMRC.

If either side disputes the amount of tax that is payable, they may appeal to either the General or Special Commissioners of Income Tax.&lt;ref name="CTM95130"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM95130.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM95130 — CTSA: assessments: appeals] which is now known as the First Tier Tax Tribunal, HMRC. Retrieved 15 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Appeals on points of law may be made to the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court]] ([[Court of Session]] in [[Scotland]]), then the [[Court of Appeals|Court of Appeal]], and finally, with leave, to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]. However, decisions of fact are binding and can only be appealed if no reasonable Commissioner could have made that decision.&lt;ref name="Tax Appeals"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/leaflets/tax-appeals.pdf Tax Appeals: A guide to appealing against decisions of the Inland Revenue on tax and other matters (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310003135/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/leaflets/tax-appeals.pdf |date=10 March 2007 }}, Department for Constitutional Affairs. Retrieved 15 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Once an enquiry is closed, or the time for opening an enquiry has passed, HMRC can only re-open a prior year if they become aware of an issue which they could not reasonably have known about at the time, or in instances of fraud or negligence. In fraud or negligence cases, they can re-open cases from up to 20 years ago.&lt;ref name="CTM95100"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM95100.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM95100 — CTSA: assessments: time limit], HMRC. Retrieved 15 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

After an HMRC enquiry closes, or after final determination of an issue by the courts, the taxpayer has 30 days to amend their return, and make additional claims and elections, if appropriate, before the assessment becomes final and conclusive. If there is no enquiry, the assessment becomes final and conclusive once the period in which the Revenue may open an enquiry passes.

==Relief from double taxation==
There is a risk of [[double taxation]] whenever a company receives income that has already been taxed. This could be [[dividend]] income, which will have been paid out of the post-tax [[Profit (economics)|profit]]s of another company and which may have suffered [[withholding tax]]. Or it could be because the company itself has suffered foreign tax, perhaps because it conducts part of its trade through an overseas [[permanent establishment]], or because it receives other types of foreign income.

Double taxation is avoided for UK dividends by exempting them from tax for most companies: only dealers in shares suffer tax on them.&lt;ref name="CTM02060"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/ctm02060.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM02060 — Corporation Tax: computation of income: dividends and other distributions received], HMRC. Retrieved 16 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Where double taxation arises because of overseas tax suffered, relief is available either in the form of expense or credit relief.&lt;ref name="IM151040"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/intmanual/intm151040.htm International Manual INTM151040 — Double taxation: concept and principles], HMRC. Retrieved 16 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Expense relief allows the overseas tax to be treated as a deductible expense in the tax computation. Credit relief is given as a deduction from the UK tax liability, but is restricted to the amount of UK tax suffered on the foreign income. There is a system of onshore pooling, so that overseas tax suffered in high tax territories may be set off against taxable income arising from low tax territories. From 1 July 2009, new rules were introduced to exempt most non-UK dividends from corporation tax so these double taxation rules in respect of non-UK dividends will be of less common application in practice after that date.

==Loss relief==
Detailed and separate rules apply to how all the different types of losses may be set off within the computations of a company.&lt;ref name="CTM04050"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM04050.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM04050 — Corporation Tax: trading losses: general: reliefs available] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207005612/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM04050.htm |date=7 February 2007 }}, HMRC. Retrieved 16 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed explanation of these can be found in: ''[[United Kingdom corporation tax loss relief]]''.

===Group relief===
The UK does not permit [[tax consolidation]], where companies in a group are treated as though they are a single entity for tax purposes. One of the main benefits of tax consolidation is that tax losses in one entity in a group are automatically relievable against the tax profits of another. Instead, the UK permits a form of loss relief called "group relief".&lt;ref name="CTM80105"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM80105.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM80105 — Groups: group relief: outline], HMRC. Retrieved 16 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a company has losses arising in an accounting period (other than capital losses, or losses arising under Case V or VI of Schedule D) in excess of its other taxable profits for the period, it may surrender these losses to a group member with sufficient taxable profits in the same accounting period.&lt;ref name="CTM80110"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM80110.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM80110 — Groups: group relief: reliefs which may be claimed], HMRC. Retrieved 16 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
The company receiving the losses may offset them against their own taxable profits. Exceptions include that a company in the oil and gas extraction industry may not accept group relief against the profits arising on its [[oil drilling|oil and gas extraction business]],&lt;ref name="OT00190"/&gt; and a life assurance company may only accept group relief against its profits chargeable to tax at the standard shareholder rate applicable to that company.&lt;ref name="LAM"/&gt; Separate rules apply for dual resident companies.

Full group relief is permitted between companies subject to UK corporation tax that are in the same 75% group, where companies have a common ultimate parent, and at least 75% of the shares in each company (other than the ultimate parent) are owned by other companies in the group. The companies making up a 75% group do not all need to be UK-resident or subject to UK corporation tax relief.

Consortium relief is permitted where a company subject to UK corporation tax is owned by a [[consortium]] of companies that each own at least 5% of the shares and together own at least 75% of the shares. A consortium company can only surrender or accept losses in proportion to how much of that company is owned by each consortium group.&lt;ref name="CTM80530"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM80530.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM80530 — Consortia: group relief: meaning of consortium members and consortium company], HMRC.

Notes:
* &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; UK trading losses brought forward from previous accounting periods must be relieved as fully as possible against any trading profits in the current accounting period. They cannot be relieved against non-trading profits.
* ² Brought forward [[non-trading debit]]s can be utilised against non-trading profits; they cannot reduce the trading profits
* ³ The management expense deduction is in relation to expenses incurred on managing the company's investments.
* &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; The marginal relief computation is as follows:
:Marginal relief fraction × (Upper limit ÷ (Number of associates + 1) – Profit)
:= 1/40 × (1,500,000 ÷ (1+1) – 580,000)
* &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; The £30,000 overseas tax has been included in the taxable Schedule D Case V figure. Double tax relief is available on the lower of overseas tax suffered and UK corporation tax suffered on the overseas income.

==Interaction with European law==
Although there are no [[European Union]] [[European Union directive|directives]] dealing with direct taxes, UK laws must comply with European legislation. In particular, legislation should not be discriminatory under the EC treaty.

A number of cases where UK tax laws are believed to be discriminatory have been brought to the [[European Court of Justice]], usually with respect to freedom of establishment and freedom of movement of capital. Key cases which have been decided include:

*''Hoechst''&lt;ref name="Hoechst"&gt;[http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=en&amp;newform=newform&amp;alljur=alljur&amp;jurcdj=jurcdj&amp;jurtpi=jurtpi&amp;jurtfp=jurtfp&amp;alldocrec=alldocrec&amp;docj=docj&amp;docor=docor&amp;docop=docop&amp;docav=docav&amp;docsom=docsom&amp;docinf=docinf&amp;alldocnorec=alldocnorec&amp;docnoj=docnoj&amp;docnoor=docnoor&amp;typeord=ALLTYP&amp;allcommjo=allcommjo&amp;affint=affint&amp;affclose=affclose&amp;numaff=&amp;ddatefs=&amp;mdatefs=&amp;ydatefs=&amp;ddatefe=&amp;mdatefe=&amp;ydatefe=&amp;nomusuel=Metallgesellschaft&amp;domaine=&amp;mots=&amp;resmax=100&amp;Submit=Submit ''Metallgesellschaft Ltd and Others, Hoechst AG, Hoechst UK Ltd and Commissioners of Inland Revenue, H.M.

However, in the final judgment, a compromise agreement was reached in which the national interest to prevent excessive loss of tax was held to outweigh in most circumstances the restriction on the freedom of movement of capital. Accordingly, although no specific new legislation has been introduced, relief for overseas losses will only be available where they may not be utilised in the overseas jurisdiction;

Also, the case of ''ICI v Colmer''&lt;ref name="ICI"&gt;''ICI v Colmer'' [1999] BTC 440&lt;/ref&gt; led to the UK amending its definition of a group, for group relief purposes. Previously, the definition required that all companies and intermediate parent companies in a group to be UK resident.

There are also a number of other cases making their way, slowly, up to the European Court. In particular:

*A [[Group Litigation Order]] arguing that dividends received from overseas companies should be exempt from tax in the same way as dividends received from UK companies are exempted from tax;&lt;ref name="GLO"&gt;[http://hamiltonbradbury.co.uk/umbrella-company/tax/group-litigation-order/ Hoechst Group Litigation Order (PDF)], HMRC. Retrieved 16 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
*Claims that the UK CFC legislation is contrary to EU law (notably Vodafone).

==Recent developments==

===Corporation tax reform===
There have been a number of proposals for corporation tax reform, although only a few have been enacted. In March 2001, the government published a technical note ''A Review of Small Business Taxation'', which considered simplification of corporation tax for small companies through the closer alignment of their profits for tax purposes with those reported in their accounts.&lt;ref name="Review SBT"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/consult_new/sbtn.pdf A Review of Small Business Taxation (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609214908/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/consult_new/sbtn.pdf |date=9 June 2007 }}, HMRC. Retrieved 17 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In July of that year, the government also published a consultation document, ''Large Business Taxation: the Government's strategy and corporate tax reforms''. It set out the strategy for modernising corporate taxes and proposals for relief for [[capital gain]]s on substantial shareholdings held by companies.

In August 2002, ''Reform of corporation tax – A consultation document'' was published, outlining initial proposals for the abolition of the Schedular system.&lt;ref name="Refrom CT"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/consult_new/taxreform_final.pdf Reform of corporation tax — A consultation document (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206123957/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/consult_new/taxreform_final.pdf |date=6 February 2007 }}, HMRC, 2002. Retrieved 17 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed up in August 2003 by ''Corporation tax reform – A consultation document'', which further discussed the possible abolition of the Schedular system, and also whether the capital allowances (tax depreciation) system should be abolished.&lt;ref name="CT reform"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/consult_new/corp-tax-reform.pdf Corporation tax reform — A consultation document (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412163948/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/consult_new/corp-tax-reform.pdf |date=12 April 2007 }}, HMRC, 2003. Retrieved 17 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It also made proposals that were ultimately enacted in Finance Act 2004.&lt;ref name="FA 2004"/&gt; (The first two of these listed below were in response to threats to the UK tax base arising from recent [[European Court of Justice]] judgments.) The changes were to:
*Introduction of transfer pricing rules for UK-to-UK transactions. Transfer pricing rules require certain transactions to be deemed to have taken place at arm's length prices for tax purposes where they did not in fact take place as such.
*Merging thin capitalisation rules with the [[transfer pricing]] rules. [[Thin capitalisation]] rules limit the amount a company can claim as a tax deduction on interest when it receives loans at non-commercial rates (from connected parties, for example).
*Extension of the deduction for management expenses to all companies with an investment business. Previously a company had to be wholly or mainly engaged in an investment business to qualify.

In December 2004, ''Corporation tax reform – a technical note'' was published. It outlined the government's decision to abolish the schedular system, replacing the numerous schedules and cases with two pools: a trading and letting pool; and an "everything else" pool. The Government had decided that capital allowances would remain, though there would be some reforms, mostly affecting the leasing industry.&lt;ref name="CT reform tech"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/pbr2004/sup_ct-reform-tech-note.pdf Corporation tax reform — a technical note (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221175440/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/pbr2004/sup_ct-reform-tech-note.pdf |date=21 February 2007 }}, HMRC, 2004. Retrieved 17 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other enactments===
Other main reforms enacted, include:

*Relief from tax on chargeable gains on disposals of substantial shareholdings in trading companies and groups (enacted by Finance Act 2002).&lt;ref name="FA 2002"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/23 Finance Act 2002], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-10-542302-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Introduction of UK to UK transfer pricing rules, coupled with the merging of the thin capitalisation rules with the transfer pricing rules (enacted by Finance Act 2004).&lt;ref name="FA 2004"/&gt;
*Extension of management expenses rules so that companies do not need to be investment companies to receive them, coupled with a specific rule preventing capital items being deductible as management expenses (enacted by Finance Act 2004).&lt;ref name="FA 2004"/&gt;

'''William Sanderson McCormick''' (November 2, 1815 – September 27, 1865) was an American businessman who developed the company that became the major producer of agricultural equipment in the 19th century. The business became the [[International Harvester]] corporation after his death.
Although he died relatively young with most of the fame going to his brothers, his extended [[McCormick family]] continued to be influential in the politics and business of Chicago.

==Life==
William Sanderson McCormick was born November 2, 1815 on the family estate known as [[Cyrus McCormick Farm|Walnut Grove]], in [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= William Sanderson McCormick |publisher= Wisconsin State Historical Society |url= http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/whi/fullRecord.asp?id=60639|accessdate= December 29, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
His father was [[Robert McCormick (Virginia)|Robert McCormick]] (1780–1846) and mother Mary Ann (Hall) McCormick. 
He was educated in public schools and took an interest in business. When the family farm had financial problems in the [[panic of 1837]], he took over its management and made it profitable again. When his father died in 1846, his older brother [[Cyrus McCormick]] and younger brother [[Leander J. McCormick]] left to start a factory to produce the mechanical [[reaper]]s that had been developed on the farm, while he was left to take care of the estate.
He married Mary Ann Grigsby (1828–1878) on July 11, 1848, daughter of Virginia planter Reuben Grigsby of [[Hickory Hill (Glasgow, Virginia)|Hickory Hill plantation]].&lt;ref name="Penn"&gt;{{cite book |author=William Henry Egle |title=Pennsylvania: genealogies chiefly Scotch-Irish and German|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UmchH3gzLcC&amp;pg=PA477 |year=1896 |publisher= Genealogical Publishing Company |isbn=978-0-8063-0102-0 |pages=477–478 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850, William, his wife, and infant son moved to Chicago to join his brothers in the family business, first on a salary basis. The [[California Gold Rush]] had created a labor shortage, which was good for demand, but also caused turnover in the factory employees. William managed the day-to-day operations of the business while Cyrus was often traveling or pursuing patent infringement lawsuits. William tried to mediate between Cyrus (who claimed all the credit as "inventor") and his brother Leander, who was now in charge of technical aspects of product development.&lt;ref name="colonel"/&gt;
In 1859 he negotiated a formal agreement giving him and Leander one fourth interest in the company, and renamed it "C. H. McCormick &amp; Brothers."

The onset of the [[American Civil War]] brought new demand, but stress from another labor shortage. McCormick bought real estate in [[downtown Chicago]] which proved to be a wise investment. The family was attacked in the press as being southern sympathizers. In fact, the family never adjusted to the brutal cold of winters in Chicago. Brother Cyrus worsened the conflict by funding conservative newspapers to battle the liberal major publishers that were tied to local politicians. Cyrus traveled to Europe in 1864 where he successfully promoted international sales.
Outwardly  McCormick was described as "of a cheerful disposition, quick spoken, ... a most interesting and agreeable man".&lt;ref name="Penn"/&gt; However, he suffered from "nervous dyspepsia" and his mental state deteriorated. Various treatments for his mental illness such as bland diets or water cures proved ineffective. In April 1865 he stated simply to Cyrus "I am extremely nervous". He continued to manage the business until checking into the [[Jacksonville Developmental Center|Illinois State Asylum]] in [[Jacksonville, Illinois]] in August 1865. He died there on September 27, 1865. His widow cashed in her share of the business, moved back to Virginia, and left the children with their uncles in Chicago.&lt;ref name="colonel"&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Richard Norton Smith]] |title= The Colonel: The Life and Legend of Robert R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6489">In [[economics]], '''willingness to accept''' ('''WTA''') is the minimum amount of money that а person is willing to accept to abandon a good or to put up with something negative, such as [[pollution]]. It is equivalent to the minimum monetary amount required for sale of a good or acquisition of something undesirable to be accepted by an individual. Conversely, '''willingness to pay''' ('''WTP''') is the maximum amount an individual is willing to sacrifice to procure a good or avoid something undesirable.  The price of any goods transaction will thus be any point between a buyer's willingness to pay and a seller's willingness to accept.  The net difference between WTP and WTA is the social surplus created by the trading of goods.

Several methods have been developed to measure consumer willingness to pay or accept payment. These methods can be differentiated whether they measure consumers' hypothetical or actual willingness to pay or accept and whether they measure consumer willingness to pay or accept directly or indirectly.

[[Choice modelling]] techniques may be used to estimate the value of the WTP or WTA through a choice experiment.

Unlike WTP, WTA is not constrained by an individual's wealth.  For example, the willingness to pay to stop the ending of one's own life can only be as high as one's wealth, while the willingness to accept compensation to accept the loss of one's life would be an extremely high number (or maybe infinite, meaning that there would be no finite acceptable payment amount).

==Formal definition==

Let ''u''(''w'', ''x'') be an individual's [[utility function]], where ''w'' is the person's wealth and ''x'' is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 in the presence of an undesired feature and takes the value 0 in the absence of that feature. The utility function is assumed to be increasing in wealth and decreasing in ''x''. Also, define ''w''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; as the person's initial wealth.  Then the "willingness to accept" is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;u(w_0 + WTA , 1) = u(w_0 , 0).&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, John Keith and Mcconnell, Kenneth, (2003), [http://www.ag.unr.edu/moeltner/APEC%20464_664/Spring_07/pdf/Horowitz_McConnell_2003.pdf "Willingness to accept, willingness to pay and the income effect"], ''Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization'', Vol. 51, No. 4, p.&amp;nbsp;537–545.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720095243/http://www.ag.unr.edu/moeltner/APEC%20464_664/Spring_07/pdf/Horowitz_McConnell_2003.pdf |date=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

That is, the willingness to accept payment in order to put up with the adverse change equates the pre-change utility (on the right side) with the post-change utility including compensation.

In contrast, the ''willingness to pay'' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;u(w_0 - WTP, 0)= u(w_0, 1).&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the willingness to pay to avoid the adverse change equates the post-change utility, diminished by the presence of the adverse change (on the right side), with utility without the adverse change but with payment having been made to avoid it.

The concept extends readily to a context of uncertain outcomes, in which case the utility function above is replaced by the [[Expected utility hypothesis|expected value of a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function]].

==Standard theory versus experimental results==
The standard assumptions of economic theory imply that when income effects are small, the gap between WTP and WTA should be negligible. Thus [[indifference curve]]s are drawn without reference to current endowments. This leads to the wide acceptance of the ''[[Coase theorem]]'' assertion that, subject to income effects, the allocation of resources will be independent of the assignment of property rights when costless trades are possible. This is to say, the allocation of property rights does not influence the way externalities are internalized by the market. However, many experiments, such as that by [[Daniel Kahneman]], Jack L. Knetsch and [[Richard Thaler]] showed that measures of WTA greatly exceed measures of WTP.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kahneman, Jack L. Knetsch, Richard H. Thaler, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2937761 "Experimental Tests of the Endowment Effect and the Coase Theorem"], ''The Journal of Political Economy'', Vol. 98, No. 6 (Dec., 1990), pp.&amp;nbsp;1325–1348&lt;/ref&gt;  Another well-known example was documented by [[Ziv Carmon]] and [[Dan Ariely]], who found that willingness to accept for tickets to a major basketball game was more than 10 times larger than the willingness to pay.&lt;ref&gt;Ziv Carmon, Dan Ariely, [https://www.jstor.org/discover/1831177?sid=21104920591001&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3738240 Focusing on the Forgone: Why Value can Appear so Different to Buyers &amp; Sellers"], ''Journal of Consumer Research'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;360–370&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation is that the [[endowment effect]] makes people value a good or service more if they possess it.

However, Plott and Zeiler&lt;ref&gt;Plott, Charles R. and Kathryn Zeiler. 2005. "The Willingness to Pay–Willingness to Accept Gap, the “Endowment Effect,” Subject Misconceptions, and Experimental Procedures for Eliciting Valuations." ''The American Economic Review'', 95(3), 530-45.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that "...observed gaps [between WTA and WTP] are symptomatic of subjects' misconceptions about the nature of the experimental task" and that "the differences reported in the literature reflect differences in experimental controls for misconceptions as opposed to differences in the nature of the commodity."

==Applications==

WTP and WTA are important factors for public policy.  Many economic decisions are based upon the implicit assignment of property rights.  When looking at a lake which is being polluted by a nearby factory, the WTA and WTP for treatment of an effluent treatment plant may have different consequences based upon how property rights are politically assigned.  If lakeside residents have no property right to an effluent-free lake, then their willingness to pay to treat the lake's water supply would be considered.  Conversely, if the lakeside residents are found to have a property right to a clean lake, then their willingness to accept compensation for a polluted lake would be considered.

'''Women in Housing and Finance (WHF)''' is a membership organization of professionals in the area of [[House|housing]] and [[finance]] located in the greater metropolitan area of [[New York City]].  Founded in 1981, WHF promotes and supports the professional growth of women in housing, finance and development and provides a vehicle through which members share knowledge and experience.

==History==

WHF Founder Cynthia Lewis was living in [[Washington, DC]], working at the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD), during the Carter years, a very heady time for women.  Many were appointed to high level jobs in the Administration. The Washington Women's Network held meetings in the Grand Ballroom of the Washington [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]] and hundreds of “power women,” and some not-so-powerful, believed that a new era had begun for women. HUD had its share with Secretary Pat Harris and Assistant Secretary [[Donna Shalala]].

Lewis was invited to join a new group called ''Women in Housing and Finance'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whfdc.org/   Women In Housing and Finance, DC]&lt;/ref&gt; composed of women from government agencies, [[Capitol Hill]] staff, and local law firms.  She recently had been put in charge of a regulatory program and was able to make the contacts she needed through the group.

Late in 1979, Lewis came back to New York to work at the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]](FDIC) and she felt very isolated.  With her responsibility for enforcement of the Community Investment Act, Lewis needed to meet people in the field.  So she started to talk to women she met about the need for an “old girls’ network.”  Lewis finally realized that it never would happen unless she did something herself. So Lewis started recruiting.

Connie Gibson, from the New Jersey Mortgage Finance Agency (NJMFA), spoke at a conference Lewis attended at [[Citibank]].  Lewis asked her if she would be interested in a women’s networking group; she was.  Lewis had met Anita Miller when, as Acting Chair of the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]] (FHLBB), she spoke at WHF Washington.  She was back in New York at the Ford Foundation and thought it would be a good idea.  Lewis also talked to Fran Levenson (Goldome Bank), Harriette Silverberg ([[Metlife]]), Kathy Wylde (Anchor Savings Bank), Lois Kleinerman (New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR)), Beverly Wettenstein ([[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]] (FHLBB)), Carla Lerman (Bergen County Housing Authority), Jean Lerman (New York City Housing Preservation and Development (HPD)), and Kay Bergin ([[Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation]]).

They all got together in Lewis’s living room in the fall of 1980.  They decided that they should each call ten women and invite them to a luncheon meeting to discuss forming a new organization.  About 50 women came, and it was clear that they were on our way.  Lewis suggested that they affiliate with WHF Washington because it was an established group.  That is how WHF got its name.  Periodically, WHF discussed changing the name, but the Board of Directors always decides that, although WHF welcomes men members, it wants to keep its original identity.

WHF began officially with a luncheon on January 16, 1981 at [[McGraw-Hill]]. Caryl Austrian, President of WHF Washington, and Anita Miller (then with the [[Ford Foundation]]) were the speakers. Beverly Wettenstein notified the media of the event.

On February 4, Cynthia Lewis and the other “founding mothers” — Kay Bergin, Jean Lerman, Harriette Silverberg, Connie Gibson, Dana Cahoon, Lois Kleinerman Bernstein, Beverly Wettenstein, Fran Levenson, and Kathy Wylde — met and formed a steering committee to draft a statement of purpose, by-laws, and membership criteria which required a “level of professionalism consistent with retaining active participation of high-level women.”

This task was completed by August. The first slate of candidates included President Cynthia Lewis, First Vice President Connie Gibson, Second Vice President Fran Levenson, Secretary Lois Bernstein, and Treasurer Mary Williams. They were elected unanimously in October, 1981, together with board members Kay Bergin, Martha Lamar, Carla Lerman, Jean Lerman, Anita Miller, Harriette Silverberg, Beverly Wettenstein, and Kathy Wylde. The members approved the By-laws and an annual budget of $5,000.

==Membership==

WHF’s membership is a diversified group of accomplished individuals drawn from all aspects of housing and finance throughout [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Connecticut]].  Members are engaged in [[architecture]], [[banking]], [[law]], [[regional development|development]], [[construction]], [[brokerage]], [[investment banking]], [[marketing]] and [[sales]], municipal [[finance]], [[accounting]], [[property management]], [[historic preservation]] and more.  Members come from the private sector, from state, local and [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agencies]], and from [[not-for-profit]] organizations and [[community groups]].

In 1997, a core group of professionals launched a vibrant New Jersey chapter which presents programs of statewide interest. More recently, WHF added a [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]/Connecticut chapter which has held several interesting and timely events.

Membership has changed over the years.   WHF also periodically discusses becoming more public and aggressively recruiting new members, but it seems that most members prefer keeping the group at roughly the same size.  About 20% of membership changes each year, but it remains around 160-190.  That’s manageable for meetings and or networking.

==Programs==

WHF has been a central resource for women in the housing and finance industry throughout the New York area.  Since its inception, as market cycles have come and gone, WHF has endeavored to present up to the minute information, networking opportunities and professional development for its members.

Programs are scheduled monthly during breakfast, lunch or early evening times.  Speakers and panelists include leaders in their fields as well as key public policy makers.  WHF also hosts professional development programs in small group settings.  These are scheduled to meet the needs of members.

Programs are frequently planned in conjunction with other New York City groups with similar missions, including: Women in Transportation, Women in Real Estate, Women’s City Club, the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], [[Citizens Housing and Planning Council (CHPC)]], [[MOMA]], [[Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy]] and The [[New-York Historical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nyhistory.org/web/ The New-York Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent programs have included the following:

*Affordable Housing Roundtable
*Green Buildings&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbangreencouncil.org/ US Green Building Council]&lt;/ref&gt;(US Green Building Council, New York)
*Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design for Neighborhood Development (LEED-ND)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrdc.org/cities/smartgrowth/leed.asp/  Natural Resources Defense Council]&lt;/ref&gt; (Natural Resources Defense Council)
*American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
*Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chpcny.org /| Citizens Housing and Planning Council]&lt;/ref&gt;(Citizens Housing and Planning Council)
*Home Delivery, Fabricating the Modern Dwelling&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.momahomedelivery.org/  The Museum of Modern Art(MOMA)]&lt;/ref&gt;(MOMA)
*Brownfield Opportunity Act&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npcr.net /| New Partners for Community Revitalization]&lt;/ref&gt;(New Partners for Community Revitalization)
*Local Effects of the Foreclosure Crisis in New York City&lt;ref&gt;[http://furmancenter.org/  Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;(Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy)

==Networking==

Supplementing regular programming, WHF sponsors a series of festive seasonal events enhancing opportunities for members to meet and get to know each other in informal social settings.  These events include a colorful autumn gathering to greet new members, a January holiday party, an adventurous behind the scenes springtime field trip that explores fascinating locales not often available to the general public and an exceptional summer dinner for WHF’s annual membership meeting to conclude the WHF year.  Honored guests and speakers have included [[Elinor Guggenheimer]], [[Alair Townsend]], [[Carol Bellamy]], [[Claire Shulman]], [[Charles Schumer]] and New York City's Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]].

To further fulfill its mission to promote the professional development of its members, WHF maintains a [[job bank]] with an updated list of positions available in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.

WHF is a member of The [[New York Women's Agenda]].
