'''Adrenal fatigue''' or '''hypoadrenia''' is a pseudoscientific diagnosis believed in [[alternative medicine]] to be the state when [[adrenal gland]]s are exhausted and unable to produce adequate quantities of [[hormone]]s, primarily the [[glucocorticoid]] [[cortisol]], due to chronic stress or infections.&lt;ref name=2012Rev&gt;{{cite journal |author = Shah R, Greenberger PA |year = 2012 |title = Unproved and controversial methods and theories in allergy-immunology |journal = Allergy Asthma Proc. |volume = 33 Suppl 1 |issue = 3 |pages = S100-2 |doi = 10.2500/aap.2012.33.3562 |pmid = 22794702 }} Quote: "There is no scientific basis for the existence of this disorder and no conclusive method for diagnosis."&lt;/ref&gt; Adrenal fatigue should not be confused with a number of actual forms of adrenal dysfunction such as [[adrenal insufficiency]] or [[Addison's disease]].&lt;ref name="webmd" /&gt;

Blood or salivary testing is sometimes offered but there is no evidence that adrenal fatigue exists or can be tested for.&lt;ref name=2012Rev/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbm"/&gt; The concept of adrenal fatigue has given rise to an industry of [[dietary supplement]]s marketed to treat this condition.

In [[marketing]], '''brand implementation''' refers to the physical representation and consistent application of [[brand identity]] across [[Visual brand language|visual]] and [[Brand language|verbal]] media. In visual terms, this can include [[signage]], [[uniforms]], [[Livery|liveries]], interior design and branded merchandise. Brand implementation encompasses facets of [[architecture]], [[product design]], [[industrial design]], [[quantity surveying]], [[engineering]], [[procurement]], [[project management]] and [[retail design]].

Brand implementation is an integrated part of a branding cycle and needs to be initiated during the brand design and development phase. Brand implementation is the continuous and consistent application of the [[brand]]'s image in all business units, communication channels and media.

This refers to marketing and branding as a unified whole. In that respect, brand implementation is a continuous process, which requires controlling the brand's image and presence despite changes in markets and company structure.&lt;ref&gt;Misof, Guenther (2007). „Brand Implementation. Managing and Controlling Brand Identity“, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Brand implementation emerged as a discipline in the 1990s when brand owners recognized the need for consistency across branded estates. Traditionally, brand implementation was handled by various parties, including shop-fitters, interior designers and sign companies. Lack of centralized project management led to inconsistencies, while information dissymmetry meant suppliers had too much control over brand issues. Brand implementation was consequently coined as an umbrella term for all aspects of the application and maintenance of physical brand assets.

==Key problem fields==
The experience of more than 80 companies operating worldwide shows that a lack of planning before the rebrand,&lt;ref&gt;Brand Implementation: TBC, Tony Lorenz, 2012 {{cite web|url=http://www.endpoint.co.uk/implementation-tbc/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222529/http://www.endpoint.co.uk/implementation-tbc/ |archivedate=2013-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; consistent implementation and complete control are the key problems of brand implementation. Eight large stumbling blocks  stand in the way of effective implementation: 
* Inadequate communication 
* No situation and needs analysis
* Lack of consequence
* Undefined processes

==Magic and Logic==
Brand implementation does not involve the design or creation of brand identity; brand implementation agencies work closely with [[Branding agency|branding agencies]] to ensure that their work is applied accurately and consistently. This relationship is referred to as Magic and Logic (RTM of Marketing Supply Chain International). Branding agencies look after the Magic (creative) and brand implementation agencies look after the Logic (implementation).

In [[physics]], a '''conservation law''' states that a particular measurable property of an isolated [[physical system]] does not change as the system evolves over time. Exact conservation laws include [[conservation of energy]], [[conservation of linear momentum]], [[conservation of angular momentum]], and [[conservation of electric charge]]. There are also many approximate conservation laws, which apply to such quantities as [[conservation of mass|mass]], [[Parity (physics)|parity]], [[lepton number]], [[baryon number]], [[strangeness]], [[hypercharge]], etc.  These quantities are conserved in certain classes of physics processes, but not in all.

A local conservation law is usually expressed mathematically as a [[continuity equation]], a [[partial differential equation]] which gives a relation between the amount of the quantity and the "transport" of that quantity.    It states that the amount of the conserved quantity at a point or within a volume can only change by the amount of the quantity which flows in or out of the volume.

From [[Noether's theorem]], each conservation law is associated with a [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] in the underlying physics.

==Conservation laws as fundamental laws of nature==

Conservation laws are fundamental to our understanding of the physical world, in that they describe which processes can or cannot occur in nature.  For example, the conservation law of energy states that the total quantity of energy in an isolated system does not change, though it may change form.  In general, the total quantity of the property governed by that law remains unchanged during physical processes.  With respect to classical physics, conservation laws include conservation of energy, mass (or matter), linear momentum, angular momentum, and electric charge.  With respect to particle physics, particles cannot be created or destroyed except in pairs, where one is ordinary and the other is an antiparticle.  With respect to symmetries and invariance principles, three special conservation laws have been described, associated with inversion or reversal of space, time, and charge.

Conservation laws are considered to be fundamental laws of nature, with broad application in physics, as well as in other fields such as chemistry, biology, geology, and engineering.

Most conservation laws are exact, or absolute, in the sense that they apply to all possible processes.  Some conservation laws are partial, in that they hold for some processes but not for others.

One particularly important result concerning conservation laws is [[Noether's theorem]], which states that there is a one-to-one correspondence between each one of them and a differentiable [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] of nature.  For example, the conservation of energy follows from the time-invariance of physical systems, and the conservation of angular momentum arises from the fact that physical systems behave the same regardless of how they are oriented in space.

==Approximate laws==

There are also '''approximate''' conservation laws.  These are approximately true in particular situations, such as low speeds, short time scales, or certain interactions.

* [[Conservation of mass|Conservation of rest mass]]
* Conservation of [[baryon number]] (See [[chiral anomaly]] and [[sphaleron]])
* Conservation of [[lepton number]] (In the [[Standard Model]])
* Conservation of [[flavor (particle physics)|flavor]] (violated by the [[weak interaction]])
* Conservation of [[parity (physics)|parity]]
* Invariance under [[charge conjugation]]
* Invariance under [[T-symmetry|time reversal]]
* [[CP symmetry]], the combination of charge and parity conjugation (equivalent to time reversal if CPT holds)

==Global and local conservation laws==
The total amount of some conserved quantity in the universe could remain unchanged if an equal amount were to appear at one point ''A'' and simultaneously disappear from another separate point ''B''.  For example, an amount of energy could appear on Earth without changing the total amount in the Universe if the same amount of energy were to disappear from a remote region of the Universe.  This weak form of "global" conservation is really not a conservation law because it is not [[Lorentz invariant]], so phenomena like the above do not occur in nature.&lt;ref name="Aitchison"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to [[Special Relativity]], if the appearance of the energy at ''A'' and disappearance of the energy at ''B'' are simultaneous in one [[inertial reference frame]], they will not be simultaneous in other inertial reference frames moving with respect to the first.  In a moving frame one will occur before the other; either the energy at ''A'' will appear ''before'' or ''after'' the energy at ''B'' disappears.  In both cases, during the interval energy will not be conserved.  

A stronger form of conservation law requires that, for the amount of a conserved quantity at a point to change, there must be a flow, or ''flux'' of the quantity into or out of the point.  For example, the amount of [[electric charge]] in a volume is never found to change without an [[electric current]] into or out of the volume that carries the difference in charge.  Since it only involves continuous ''[[principle of locality|local]]'' changes, this stronger type of conservation law is [[Lorentz invariant]]; a quantity conserved in one reference frame is conserved in all moving reference frames.&lt;ref name="Aitchison" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Will"/&gt;  This is called a ''local conservation'' law.&lt;ref name="Aitchison" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Will"/&gt;  Local conservation also implies global conservation; that the total amount of the conserved quantity in the Universe remains constant.  All of the conservation laws listed above are local conservation laws. A local conservation law is expressed mathematically by a ''[[continuity equation]]'', which states that the change in the quantity in a volume is equal to the total net  "flux" of the quantity through the surface of the volume.  The following sections discuss continuity equations in general.

==Differential forms==
{{see also|conservation form|continuity equation}}
In continuum mechanics, the most general form of an exact conservation law is given by a [[continuity equation]]. For example, conservation of electric charge ''q'' is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = - \nabla \cdot \mathbf{j} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ∇⋅ is the [[divergence]] operator, ''ρ'' is the density of ''q'' (amount per unit volume), '''j''' is the flux of ''q'' (amount crossing a unit area in unit time), and ''t'' is time.

If we assume that the motion '''u''' of the charge is a continuous function of position and time, then
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{j} = \rho \mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In one space dimension this can be put into the form of a homogeneous first-order [[nonlinear partial differential equation|quasilinear]] [[hyperbolic equation]]:&lt;ref name="To24"&gt;see Toro, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + A(y) y_x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the dependent variable ''y'' is called the ''density'' of a ''conserved quantity'', and ''A(y)'' is called the ''[[current jacobian]]'', and the [[Notation for differentiation#Partial derivatives|subscript notation for partial derivatives]] has been employed. The more general inhomogeneous case:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + A(y) y_x = s &lt;/math&gt;

is not a conservation equation but the general kind of [[balance equation]] describing a [[dissipative system]]. The dependent variable ''y'' is called a ''nonconserved quantity'', and the inhomogeneous term ''s(y,x,t)'' is the-''[[Divergence|source]]'', or [[dissipation]]. For example, balance equations of this kind are the momentum and energy [[Navier-Stokes equations]], or the [[entropy#Entropy balance equation for open systems|entropy balance]] for a general [[isolated system]].

In the '''one-dimensional space''' a conservation equation is a first-order [[nonlinear partial differential equation|quasilinear]] [[hyperbolic equation]] that can be put into the ''advection'' form:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + a(y) y_x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the dependent variable ''y(x,t)'' is called the density of the ''conserved'' (scalar) quantity (c.q.(d.) = conserved quantity (density)), and ''a(y)'' is called the '''current coefficient''', usually corresponding to the [[partial derivative]] in the conserved quantity of a [[current density]] (c.d.) of the conserved quantity ''j(y)'':&lt;ref name="To24" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; a(y) = j_y (y)&lt;/math&gt;

In this case since the [[chain rule]] applies:

:&lt;math&gt; j_x= j_y (y) y_x = a(y) y_x &lt;/math&gt;

the conservation equation can be put into the current density form:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + j_x (y)= 0 &lt;/math&gt;

In a '''space with more than one dimension''' the former definition can be extended to an equation that can be put into the form:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + \mathbf a(y) \cdot \nabla y = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the ''conserved quantity'' is ''y('''r''',t)'', ''&lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt;'' denotes the [[scalar product]], ''&amp;nabla;'' is the [[nabla symbol|nabla]] operator, here indicating a [[gradient]], and ''a(y)'' is a vector of current coefficients, analogously corresponding to the [[divergence]] of a vector c.d. associated to the c.q. '''j'''(y):

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + \nabla \cdot \mathbf  j(y) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

This is the case for the [[continuity equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_t + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf u) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Here the conserved quantity is the [[mass]], with [[density]] ''&amp;rho;''('''r''',t) and current density  ''&amp;rho;'''''u''', identical to the [[momentum conservation|momentum density]], while '''u'''('''r''',t) is the [[flow velocity]].

In the '''general case''' a conservation equation can be also a system of this kind of equations (a [[vector equation]]) in the form:&lt;ref name="To24" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf y_t + \mathbf A(\mathbf y) \cdot \nabla \mathbf y = \mathbf 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where '''y''' is called the ''conserved'' ('''vector''') quantity, &amp;nabla; y is its [[gradient]], '''0''' is the [[zero vector]], and '''A(y)''' is called the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] of the current density. In fact as in the former scalar case, also in the vector case '''A(y)''' usually corresponding to the Jacobian of a [[current density matrix]] '''J(y)''':

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf A( \mathbf y) = \mathbf J_{\mathbf y} (\mathbf y)&lt;/math&gt;

and the conservation equation can be put into the form:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf y_t + \nabla \cdot \mathbf J (\mathbf y)= \mathbf 0 &lt;/math&gt;

For example, this the case for Euler equations (fluid dynamics). In the simple incompressible case they are:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla\cdot \mathbf u=0\\[1.2ex]
{\partial \mathbf u \over\partial t}+ \mathbf u \cdot
\nabla \mathbf u + \nabla s =\mathbf{0},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*'''''u''''' is the [[flow velocity]] [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], with components in a N-dimensional space ''u&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''u&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' ... ''u&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'',
*''s'' is the specific [[pressure]] (pressure per unit [[density]]) giving the [[Linear differential equation|source term]],

{{see also|Euler equations (fluid dynamics)}}

It can be shown that the conserved (vector) quantity and the c.d. matrix for these equations are respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}1 \\  \mathbf u \end{pmatrix}; \qquad
{\mathbf J}=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf u\\ \mathbf u \otimes \mathbf u + s \mathbf I\end{pmatrix};\qquad
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;'' denotes the [[outer product]].

==Integral and weak forms==
Conservation equations can be also expressed in integral form: the advantage of the latter is substantially that it requires less smoothness of the solution, which paves the way to [[weak formulation|weak form]], extending the class of admissible solutions to include discontinuous solutions.&lt;ref name="ToroInt"&gt;see Toro, p.62-63&lt;/ref&gt; By integrating in any space-time domain the current density form in 1-D space:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + j_x (y)= 0 &lt;/math&gt;

and by using [[Green's theorem]], the integral form is:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{- \infty}^\infty y \, dx + \int_0^\infty j (y) \, dt = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

In a similar fashion, for the scalar multidimensional space, the integral form is:

:&lt;math&gt; \oint [y \, d^N r + j (y) \, dt] = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the line integration is performed along the boundary of the domain, in an anticlock-wise manner.&lt;ref name="ToroInt" /&gt;

Moreover, by defining a [[test function]] ''&amp;phi;''('''r''',''t'') continuously differentiable both in time and space with compact support, the [[weak formulation|weak form]] can be obtained pivoting on the [[initial condition]]. In 1-D space it is:

: &lt;math&gt; \int_0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty \phi_t y + \phi_x j(y) \,dx \,dt = - \int_{-\infty}^\infty \phi(x,0) y(x,0) \, dx &lt;/math&gt;

Note that in the weak form all the partial derivatives of the density and current density have been passed on to the test function, which with the former hypothesis is sufficiently smooth to admit these derivatives.&lt;ref name="ToroInt" /&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=February 2017}}
'''Copywriting''' is the act of writing text for the purpose of advertising or other forms of [[marketing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/copywriter|title=copywriter {{!}} Definition of copywriter in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The product, called [[Copy (written)|copy]], is written content that aims to increase [[brand awareness]] and ultimately persuade a person or group to take a particular action.

Copywriters help create [[Billboard (advertising)|billboards]], [[brochure]]s, [[Mail order|catalogs]], [[jingle]] [[lyrics]], [[magazine]] and [[newspaper]] advertisements, [[sales letter]]s and other [[direct mail]], scripts for [[television]] or [[radio]] commercials, [[tagline]]s, [[white papers]], [[social media]] posts, and other [[marketing communications]].

They are generally known as [[website content writer]]s or copywriters if their work appears mostly on the [[Internet]]. A content writer helps create [[Online advertising|online advertisements]], [[web page]]s, [[email]] newsletters, [[blog]] posts and [[social media]] posts.

Cross discipline copywriters who look at the wider context of their work are called '''digital copywriters'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alldaycreative.co.uk/blog/essential-skills-every-digital-copywriter-needs/|title=Essential skills every digital copywriter needs|author=|date=2 March 2011|website=alldaycreative.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction is that these individuals consider the mechanics of the [[user journey]], the [[external links]] that are included in the copy for [[search engine optimization]] and are highly focused towards creating online [[sales]] and dealing with technical issues such as [[bounce rate]].

==Employment==
Many copywriters are employed in [[advertising agency|advertising agencies]], [[public relations]] firms, or [[copywriting agency|copywriting agencies]].

*'''Advertising agencies''' usually employ copywriters as part of a creative team in which they are partnered with [[Art director|art directors]] or [[Creative director|creative directors]]. The copywriter writes copy or script for an advertisement, based largely on information obtained from the client. The art director is responsible for visual aspects of the advertisement and, particularly in the case of print work, may oversee production. Either member of the team can come up with the overall idea (typically referred to as the concept) and the process of collaboration often improves the work.
*'''Copywriting agencies''' combine copywriting with a range of editorial and associated services that may include positioning and messaging consulting, social media, [[search engine optimization]], developmental editing, [[copy editing]], [[proofreading]], [[fact checking]], [[Page layout|layout]] and [[design]]. The clients are usually large corporations.

Copywriters also work in-house for retail chains, book publishers or other big firms which advertise frequently. They can also be employed to write [[advertorial]]s for [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]] and cable providers.

Some copywriters work as [[independent contractor]]s, doing [[freelance]] writing for a variety of clients. They may work at a client's office, a [[coworking]] office, a [[coffeehouse]], or from home.

Copywriters are similar to [[technical writer]]s and the careers may overlap. Broadly speaking, however, technical writing is dedicated to informing readers rather than persuading them. For example, a copywriter writes an advertisement to sell a car, while a technical writer writes the operator's manual explaining how to use it.

A '''Discrete Global Grid''' ('''DGG''') is a [[tessellation|mosaic]]  which covers the entire Earth's surface.
Mathematically it is a [[space partitioning]]: it consists of a set of non-empty regions that form a [[Partition of a set|partition]] of the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name="gdggs03"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a usual grid-modeling strategy, to simplify position calculations, each region is represented by a point, abstracting the grid as a set of region-points.  Each region or region-point in the grid  is called a '''cell'''.

When each cell of a grid is subject to a [[Recursion|recursive]] partition, resulting in a "series of discrete global grids with progressively finer resolution",&lt;ref name="OSU Tech Report"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; forming a hierarchical grid, it is named '''Hierarchical DGG''' (sometimes "DGG system").

Discrete Global Grids are used as the geometric basis for the building of geospatial [[data structure]]s. Each cell is [[Entity–relationship model|related with]] data objects or values, or (in the hierarchical case)  may be associated with other cells. '''DGGs''' have been proposed for use in a wide range of geospatial applications, including vector and raster location representation, data fusion, and spatial databases.&lt;ref name="gdggs03"/&gt;

The most usual grids are for [[horizontal position representation]], using a standard  [[reference ellipsoid|datum]], like [[World Geodetic System|WGS84]]. In this context is commom also to  use a specific DGG as foundation for [[List of geocoding systems|geocoding standardization]].

In the context of a [[spatial index]], a DGG can assign unique identifiers to each grid cell, using it for spatial indexing purposes, in [[Spatial database#Geodatabase|geodatabases]] or for [[geocoding]].

== Reference model of the globe ==

The "globe", in the DGG concept, have no strict semantic; but in Geodesy a so-called "[[Grid reference|Grid Reference]] System" is a  grid that divides space with precise positions relative to a  [[geodetic datum|datum]], that is an approximated a "standard model of the [[Geoid]]".  So, in the role of Geoid, the "globe" covered by a DGG can be any of the following  objects:

* The  [[Terrain|''topographical surface'' of the Earth]], when each cell of the grid have its surface-position coordinates and the elevantion in relation to the [[Geodetic datum|standard Geoid]]. Example: grid with coordinates  ''(φ,λ,z)'' where z is the elevation.
* A [[Geodetic datum|standard ''Geoid surface'']]. The z coordinate is zero for all grid, them can be omitted,  ''(φ,λ)''. &lt;br/&gt;Ancient standards, before 1687  (the Newton's Principia publication), used a "reference sphere"; in nowadays the Geoid is mathematically abstracted as [[reference ellipsoid]].
** A ''simplified Geoid'': sometimes an old geodesic standard (e.g. [[South American Datum#SAD69|SAD69]]) or a non-geodesic surface (e. g. perfectly spherical surface) must be adopted, and will covered by the grid. In this case cells must be labeled with non-ambiguous way, ''(φ',λ')'', and the transformation ''(φ,λ)⟾(φ',λ')'' must be known.
* A [[Map projection|''projection surface'']]. Typically the geographic coordinates ''(φ,λ)'' are projected ([[Tissot's indicatrix|with some distortion]]) onto the 2D mapping plane with 2D Cartesian coordinates ''(x, y)''.

As a global modeling process, modern DGGs, when including projection process, tend to avoid surfaces like cylinder or a conic solids that result in discontinuities and indexing problems. [[Regular polyhedra]] and other topological equivalents of sphere led to the most promising known options to be covered by DGGs,&lt;ref name="gdggs03"/&gt; because "spherical projections preserve the ''correct topology'' of the Earth – there are no singularities or discontinuities to deal with".&lt;ref&gt;http://s2geometry.io/about/overview&lt;/ref&gt;

When working with a DGG it is important to specify which of these options was adopted. So, the characterization of the ''reference model of the globe'' of a DGG can be summarized by:

*  The recovered '''object''': the object type in the role of globe. If there are no projection, the object covered by the grid is the Geoid, the Earth or a sphere; else is the geometry class of the projection surface (e.g. a cylinder, a cube or a cone).
* '''Projection''' type:  absent (no projection) or present. When present,  its characterization can be summarized  by the [[List of map projections|projection's goal property]] (e.g. equal-area, conformal, etc.) and the class of the corrective function (e.g. trigonometric, linear,  quadractic, etc.).

NOTE: when the DGG is covering a projection surface, in a context of [[Data lineage#Data Provenance|data provenance]], the metadata about reference-Goid is also important &amp;mdash;  typical informing its [[Spatial reference system|ISO 19111's CRS]] value, with no confusion with the projection surface.

== Types and examples ==
The main distinguishing feature to classify or compare DGGs is the use or not of an hierarchical grid structures:

* In '''hierarchical''' reference systems each cell is a "box reference" to a subset of cells, and cell identifiers can express this hierarchy in its numbering logic or structure.
* In '''non-hierarchical''' reference systems each cell have a distinc identifier and represents a fixed-scale region of the space. The discretization of the [[Geographic coordinate system|Latitude/Longitude system]]  is the most popular, and the standard reference for conversions.

Other usual criteria to classify a DGG are tile-shape and granularity (''grid resolution''):

* '''Tile regularity and shape''':  there are regular, semi-regular  or [[Unstructured grid|irregular grid]]. As in generic [[Euclidean tilings by convex regular polygons|tilings by regular polygons]],  is possible to tiling  with regular face (like wall tiles can be rectangular, triangular,  hexagonal, etc.), or with same face type but changing its size or angles, resulting in semi-regular shapes. &lt;br/&gt;Uniformity of shape and regularity of metrics provide better grid-indexing algorithms. Although it has less practical use, totally irregular grids are possible, such in a [[Voronoi diagram|Voronoi]] coverage.
* Fine or coarse '''granulation''' (cell size): modern DGGs are parametrizable in its grid resolution, so, it is a characteristic of the final DGG instance, but not useful to classify DGGs, except when the DGG-type must use an specific resolution or have a discretization limit. A "fine" granulation grid is non-limited and "coarse" refers to drastic limitation. Historically the main limitations are related to digital/analogic media, the compression/expanded representations of the grid in a database, and the memory limitations to store the grid. When  a quantitative characterization is necessary, the average area of the grid cells or average distance between cell centers can be adopted.

===  Non-hierarchical grids  ===

The most common class of Discrete Global Grids are those that place cell center points on longitude/latitude meridians and parallels, or which use the longitude/latitude meridians and parallels to form the boundaries of rectangular cells. Examples of such grids, all based on Latitude/Longitude:

{{DGGrid_meta| [[Universal Transverse Mercator#UTM zone|UTM zones]] 
|Divides the Earth into sixty (strip) zones, each being a six-degree band of longitude. In digital media removes overlapping zone. Use secant transverse Mercator projection in each zone. Define 60 secant cylinders, 1 per zone.&lt;br/&gt; The ''UTM zones'' was enhanced by [[Military Grid Reference System]] (MGRS), by addition of the  [[Universal Transverse Mercator#Latitude bands|Latitude bands]].

{{DGGrid_meta| (modern) UTM - [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|Universal Transverse Mercator]]
|Is a discretization of the continuous UTM grid, with a kind of 2-level hierarchy, where the first level (coarse grain)  correspond to the "UTM zones with latitude bands" (the [[Military Grid Reference System|MGRS]]), use the same 60 cylinders as reference-projection objects.  &lt;br/&gt;Each fine-grain cell is designated by an  structured ID composed by "grid zone designator", "the 100,000-meter square identifier"  and "numerical location". The grid resolution is a direct function of the number of digits in the coordinates, that is also standarized. For instance the cell  &lt;code&gt;17N 630084 4833438&lt;/code&gt; is a ~10mx10m square.&lt;br/&gt;PS: this standard use 60 distinct cylinders for projections. There are also "Regional Transverse Mercator" (RTM or UTM Regional) and "Local Transverse Mercator" (LTM or UTM Local) standards, with more specific cylinders, for better fit and precision at the point of interest.

{{DGGrid_meta| [[ISO 6709]] 
|Discretizes the traditional "graticule" representation and the modern numeric-coordinate cell-based locations. The granularity is fixed by a simple convention of the numeric representation, e. g. one-degree graticule, .01 degree graticule, etc. and it results in non-equal-area cells over the grid. The shape of the cells are rectangular except in the poles, where they are triangular. The numeric representation is standardized by two main conventions: degrees (Annex D) and decimal (Annex F). The grid resolution is controlled by the number of digits (Annex H).

The grey-and-green grid in the second and third maps are hierarchical.]]&lt;!-- (see intro text) Also named '''Geodesic Discrete Global Grid System''', or sometimes called simply a [[geodesic grid]], is formed by recursively sub-dividing a planar or spherical [[polyhedra]].&lt;ref name="gdggs03"/&gt; --&gt;

Only a grey cell in the center, with no need of zoom for detail, remains level-0; all other cells of the second map was partitioned into four-cells-grid (grid-level-1), each with 75&amp;nbsp;km. In the third map 12 cells level-1 remains as grey, all other was partitioned again, each level-1-cell transformed into a level-2-grid. &lt;br/&gt;'''Examples of DGGs''' that use such recursive process, generating hierarchical grids, include:

== Database modeling ==
[[file:DGG-uml01.png|thumb|520px|In all DGG databases the grid is a [[Class diagram#Composition|composition]] of its cells. The &lt;samp&gt;region&lt;/samp&gt; and &lt;samp&gt;centralPoint&lt;/samp&gt; are illustrated as typical properties or subclasses. The cell identifier ('''cell ID''') is also an important property, used as internal index and/or as public label of the cell (instead the point-coordinates) in [[geocoding]] applications. Sometimes, as in the MGRS grid, the coordinates make the role of ID.]]

There are many DGGs because there are many representational, optimization and modeling alternatives. All DGG grid is a composition of its cells, and, in the Hierarchical DGG each cell use a new grid over its local region.

The illustration is not adequate to [[Triangulated irregular network|TIN DEM]] cases and similar "raw data" structures, where the database not use the cell concept (that geometrically is the triangular region), but nodes and edges: each node is an elevation and each edge is the distance between to nodes.

In general each cell of the DGG is identified by the coordinates of its region-point (illustrated as the &lt;samp&gt;centralPoint&lt;/samp&gt; of a database representation). It is also possible, with loss of functionality, to use a "free identifier", that is, any unique number or unique symbolic label per cell, the '''cell ID'''. The ID is usually used as spatial index (such as internal [[Quadtree]] or [[k-d tree]]), but is also possible to transform ID into a human-readable label for  [[geocoding]] applications.

Modern databases (e.g. using S2 grid) use also multiple representations for the same data, offering both, a grid (or cell region) based in the Geoid and a grid based in the projection.

== History ==
Discrete Global Grids with cell regions defined by parallels and meridians of [[latitude]]/[[longitude]] have been used since the earliest days of global [[Digital mapping|geospatial computing]]. Before it, the discretization of continuous coordinates for practical purposes, with paper maps, occurred only with low granularity.  Perhaps the most representative and main example of DGG of this pre-digital era was the 1940s military [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|UTM DGGs]], with finner granulaed cell identification for [[geocoding]] purposes. Similarly some ''hierarchical grid'' exists before geospatial computing, but only in coarse granulation.

A global surface is not required for use on daily geographical maps, and the memory was very expansive before the 2000s, to put all planetary data into the same computer. The first digital global grids was used for data processing of the satellite images and global ([[Climate model|climatic]] and [[List of ocean circulation models|oceanographic]]) fluid dynamics modeling.

The first published references to ''Hierarchical Geodesic DGG'' systems are to systems developed for atmospheric modeling and published in 1968. These systems have hexagonal cell regions created on the surface of a spherical [[icosahedron]].

The spatial hierarchical grids was subject to more intensive studies in the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/edaa/8fc5e196791c821a5c81e987e2f5ca3c6aa5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; when main structures, as [[Quadtree]], was adapted in image indexing and databases.

While specific instances of these grids have been in use for decades, the term ''Discrete Global Grids'' were coined by researchers at [[Oregon State University]] in 1997&lt;ref name="OSU Tech Report" /&gt; to describe the class of all such entities.

=== Comparison and evolution ===

The evaluation Discrete Global Grid consists of many aspects, including area, shape, compactness, etc.
Evaluation methods for [[map projection]], such as [[Tissot's indicatrix]], are also suitable for evaluating map projection based Discrete Global Grid.

[[File:Hilbert curve.png|thumb|320px|The Hilbert curve adopted in DGGs like S2,  for optimal spatial indexation. Was an evolution from [[Z-order curve|Z-curve indexes]], because have no "jumps", preserving nearest cells as neighbours.]]

In addition, averaged ratio between complementary profiles (AveRaComp) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Averaged ratio between complementary profiles for evaluating shape distortions of map projections and spherical hierarchical tessellations | year = 2016 | first1 = Jin | last1 = Yan | first2 = Xiao | last2 = Song | first3 = Guanghong | last3 = Gong | journal = Computers &amp; Geosciences | volume = 87 | pages = 41–55 | accessdate = 2015-11-27 | doi=10.1016/j.cageo.2015.11.009 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098300415300868}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives a good evaluation of shape distortions for quadrilateral-shaped Discrete Global Grid.

Database development-choices and adaptations are oriented by practical  demands, for greater performance, reliability or  precision. The best choices are being selected and adapted to necessities,  propitiating the evolution of the DGG architectures. Examples of this evolution process: from  non-hierarchical to hierarchical DGGs; from the use of Z-curve indexes (a ''naive algorithm'' based in digits-interlacing), used by Geohash, to Hilbert-curve indexes, used in modern optimizations, like S2.

== Geocoding variants ==

In general each cell of the grid is identified by the coordinates of its region-point, but it is also possible to simplify the coordinate syntax and semantics, to obtain an identifier, as in a classic [[alphanumeric grid]]s &amp;mdash; and find the coordinates of a region-point from its identifier. 
Small and fast coordinate representations is a goal in the cell-ID implementations, for any DGG solutions.

There are no loss of functionality when using a  "free identifier" instead a coodinate, that is, any unique number or unique symbolic label per region-point, the '''cell ID'''.  So, to transform a coordinate into a human-readable label, and/or compressing the length of the label, is an additional step in the grid  representation.

Some popular "[[List of geocoding systems|global place codes]]" as [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] for administrative regions or [[Longhurst code]] for ecological regions of the globe, are ''partial'' in globe's coverage.  By other hand, any set of cell-identifiers of a specific DGG can be used as "[[Tessellation#Voronoi tilings|full-coverage]] place codes". Each different set of IDs, when used as a standard for data interchange purposes, are named "geocoding system".
 
There are many ways to represent the value of a cell identifier (''cell-ID'') of a grid: structured or monolithic, binary or not, human-readable or not. Supposing a map feature, like the [[wikidata:Q208760|Singapore's Merlion fountaine]] (~5m scale feature), represented by its [[Minimum bounding box|minimum bounding cell]] or a center-point-cell, the ''cell ID'' will be:

All these geocodes represents the same position in the globe,  with similar precision,  but differ in [[String (computer science)|string]]-length, separators-use and alphabet (non-separator characters).   
In some cases the "original DGG" representation can be used. The variants are minor changes, affecting only final representation, for example the base of the numeric representation, or interlacing parts of the structured into only one number or code representation. The most popular variants are used for geocoding applications.

=== Alphanumeric global grids ===
DGGs and its variants, with [[Human-readable medium|human-readable]] cell-identifiers, has been used as [[De facto standard|''de facto'' standard]] for [[alphanumeric grid]]s.  It is not limited to alphanumeric symbols, but "alphanumeric" is the most usual term.

Geocodes are notations for locations, and in a DGG context, notations to express grid cell IDs. There are a continuous evolution in digital standards and DGGs, so a continuous  change in the popularity of each geocoding covention in the last years. Broader adoption also depends on country's government adoption, use in popular mapping platforms, and many other factors.

Examples used in the following list are about "minor grid cell" containing the [[wikidata:Q178114|Washington obelisk]], &lt;code&gt;38° 53′ 22.11″ N, 77° 2′ 6.88″ W&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17210">The '''Doctor of Engineering,''' or Engineering Doctorate, (abbreviated '''Eng.D.''', '''D.Eng.''', '''D.Engr.''', '''Dr.Eng.''', or '''Dr.-Ing.''') is a [[doctoral degree]] awarded on the basis of advanced study and [[research]] in [[engineering]] and [[applied sciences]]. In most of the countries it is a terminal [[research doctorate]]; in the [[United Kingdom]] it can be a [[higher doctorate]]. An EngD degree is essentially an engineering PhD with a solid industrial base and an additional taught element.  

Along with the PhD, it represents the highest academic qualification in engineering. Successful completion of a EngD or PhD in engineering is required to gain employment as a full-time, tenure-track university [[professor]] or [[postdoctoral researcher]] in the field. As with other earned research doctorates, individuals with the degree are awarded the academic title [[Doctor (title)|doctor]], which is often represented via the [[English honorific]] "Dr."  

EngD candidates submit a significant project, typically referred to as a [[thesis]], [[dissertation]], or [[Praxis (process)|praxis]], consisting of a body of original academic research that is in principle worthy of publication in a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] journal. Candidates must [[Thesis defense|defend]] this work before a panel of expert examiners called a thesis, dissertation, or doctoral committee.  

== International equivalent qualifications ==
Countries following the German/US model of education usually have similar requirements for awarding Ph.D.(Eng.) and doctor of engineering degrees. The common degree abbreviations in the USA are EngD, D.Eng., D.Eng.Sc./Eng.Sc.D, whereas in the German-speaking world it is more commonly known as [[Dr.-Ing.]] The common degree abbreviation in the Netherlands is [[Professional Doctorate in Engineering]] (PDEng).

== History - Research Doctorate ==
To be admitted as a doctoral student, one must hold a [[Master's degree]] in engineering or related science subject and pass a comprehensive entrance exam. The student must complete necessary course work, be taught examinable courses, perform independent research under supervision of a qualified [[doctoral advisor]], and pass the thesis defense. The degree requires a high level of expertise in the theoretical aspects of relevant scientific principles and experience with details of the implementation of theory on realistic problems. The D.Eng. takes three to six years (full-time) to complete and has compulsory taught components and coursework/projects and is granted in recognition of high achievement in scholarship and an ability to apply engineering fundamentals to the solution of complex technical problems.

A Doctor of Engineering degree awarded by universities in [[China]], [[Japan]], and [[South Korea]] is equivalent to a PhD degree. To be admitted as a doctoral student, one must hold a master's degree in the same or related subject and pass a comprehensive entrance exam. The student must complete necessary course work, perform independent research under supervision of a qualified Doctoral Advisor, and pass the thesis defense. It usually takes more than three years for a student with an M.S. Degree to complete his/her doctoral study. However, there are few areas of study(such as Materials Science, Polymer Technology, and Biomedical Engineering) where both Doctor of Science and Doctor of Engineering can be awarded depending upon the graduate school which houses the department.

In [[Germany]] the doctoral degree in engineering is called ''[[Doktoringenieur]]'' (Doktor der Ingenieurwissenschaften, Dr.-Ing.) and is usually earned after four to six years of research and completing a dissertation. A researcher pursuing a doctorate needs to hold a master's degree or the ''[[Diplom-Ingenieur]]'' degree (Dipl.-Ing.).

In [[France]] the degree of "Doctor-Engineer" (''docteur-ingénieur'') was a former applied science research degree. It was discontinued after 1984 and engineers wishing to go further as researchers now seek a PhD.

== History - Higher Doctorate ==
The Engineering Doctorate scheme is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[postgraduate education]] programme promoted by the [[United Kingdom|UK's]] [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] (EPSRC).  The programme is undertaken over four years.  Students conduct [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]-equivalent research and undertake taught business and technical courses whilst working closely with an industrial sponsor.  Successful candidates are awarded the degree of Doctor of Engineering (EngD) and are addressed as ''doctor''.

The first programmes began in 1992. In 2009, Engineering Doctorate schemes were offered by 45 [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[University|universities]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/students/centres/Pages/byuni.aspx|title=Engineering Doctorate Centre Details|publisher=Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629212612/http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/students/centres/Pages/byuni.aspx|archivedate=2011-06-29|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2010-01-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; both singly or in partnership with other universities as industrial doctorate centres. Students on the scheme are encouraged to describe themselves as 'research engineers' rather than 'research students' and as of 2009 the minimum funding level was £1,500 higher than the minimum funding level for PhD students.&lt;ref name="funding2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/students/Pages/minimumpay.aspx|title=Minimum payments|publisher=Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121205152331/http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/students/Pages/minimumpay.aspx|archivedate=2012-12-05|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2013-02-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of the scheme like to draw attention to the fact that EngD students share some courses with MBA students.

In the UK a similar formation to doctorate is the [[NVQ]] 8 or [[QCF]] 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ofqual.gov.uk/help-and-advice/comparing-qualifications/|title=Comparing qualifications levels|accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a doctoral degree typically incorporates a research project which must offer an original contribution to knowledge within an academic subject area; an element which NVQs lack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graduates.co.uk/how-do-nvqs-stack-up-against-degrees/|title=How Do NVQs Stack Up Against Degrees?|work=Graduates.co.uk - Careers Advice, Postgrad Study and Gap Year}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the D.Eng. degree was traditionally awarded as a [[higher doctorate]] on the basis of a significant contribution to some field of engineering over the course of a career. However, since 1992 some British universities have introduced the [[Engineering Doctorate]], abbreviated as "EngD", which is instead a research doctorate and regarded in the UK as equivalent to a PhD.

The Engineering Doctorate (EngD) scheme was established by the EPSRC in 1992 following the recommendations of the 1990 Engineering Doctorate Report, produced by a working group chaired by Professor John Parnaby.&lt;ref name="Irwin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=93762&amp;sectioncode=26|title=Doctoring the degree (17 May 1996)|last=Irwin|first=Aisling|work=Times Higher Education Supplement|publisher=Times Higher Education|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was launched with five centres - at Warwick, UMIST and Manchester universities and a Welsh consortium led by University College Swansea.&lt;ref name="Irwin" /&gt; After a 1997 review, a further tranche of five centres was established, and further centres were added in 2001 and 2006 following calls by EPSRC in particular areas of identified national need.&lt;ref name="EPSRC Review"&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of a Review of the EPSRC Engineering Doctorate Centres|publisher=EPSRC|year=March 2007|location=Swindon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006 stakeholder survey of the scheme conducted on behalf of EPSRC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/CMSWeb/Downloads/Other/EngDocStakeholderSurvey.pdf|title=Review of the Engineering Doctorate Scheme: Stakeholders Survey|publisher=Strategic Marketing Associates|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090319101514/http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/CMSWeb/Downloads/Other/EngDocStakeholderSurvey.pdf|archive-date=2009-03-19|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2008-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was found that the quality of output of research engineers was perceived to match or exceed that of a PhD. However, the majority of respondents disagreed with claims that EngDs were recruited to higher-paid posts than PhDs or that EngDs were more desirable to employers than PhDs.  Observations were made that the EngD was not widely known, and that universities may offer EngD degrees that were not necessarily of the format promoted by the EPSRC.

A March 2007 "Review of the EPSRC Engineering Doctorate Centres"&lt;ref name="EPSRC Review" /&gt; noted that since 1992, some 1230 research engineers had been enrolled, sponsored by over 510 different companies (28 had sponsored at least six REs), at 22 centres based at 14 universities (some jointly run by several collaborating universities). The panel remained convinced of the value and performance of the EngD scheme, and made six key recommendations including clearer brand definition, academic study of the longer term impacts of the scheme, promotion of the scheme to potential new sponsors, business sectors and REs, work with the [[Engineering Council UK]] to develop a career path for REs to [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|Chartered Engineer]] status, creation of a virtual "EngD Academy", and increased resources for the scheme.

Work on establishing an Association of Engineering Doctorates began in 2010.&lt;ref name="About AEngD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aengd.org.uk/about-us/background/|title=About the AEngD|work=Association of Engineering Doctorates|publisher=AEngD|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship between EngD and PhD ==
The Doctor of Engineering and the PhD in Engineering are equivalent degrees. Both doctorates are research doctorates representing the highest academic qualification in engineering. As such, both EngD and PhD programs require students to develop original research leading to a dissertation defense. Furthermore, both doctorates enable holders to become faculty members at academic institutions. The EngD and PhD in Engineering are terminal degrees, allowing the recipient to obtain a tenure-track position.

In other cases, the distinction is one of orientation and intended outcomes. The Doctor of Engineering degree is designed for practitioners who wish to apply the knowledge they gain in a business or technical environment. Unlike a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree program, wherein research leads to foundational work that is published in industry journals, the EngD demands that research be applied to solving a real-world problem using the latest engineering concepts and tools. The program culminates in the production of a thesis, dissertation, or praxis, for use by practicing engineers to address a common concern or challenge. Research toward the EngD is “applied” rather than basic. 

The PhD is highly focused on developing theoretical knowledge, while the EngD emphasizes applied research. Upon completion, graduates of PhD programs generally migrate to full-time faculty positions in academia, while those of EngD programs re-emerge in industry as applied researchers or Executives. If working full-time in industry, graduates of EngD and PhD programs often become [[Adjunct professors in the United States|adjunct professors]] in top undergraduate and graduate degree programs.

He was employed by [[Erasmus Medical Center]] in [[Rotterdam]], Netherlands, where he was the head of the perioperative cardiac care unit. In addition, he was a member of the [[European Society of Cardiology]] Committee for Practice Guidelines and he acted as the Chairperson of the Task Force for the European Society of Cardiology.

==Scientific misconduct: the 2011/2012 investigation==
Don Poldermans was conducting research for Erasmus when accusations regarding the integrity of Poldermans’ work were brought forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Husten, Larry | date = 2011 | title = Prominent Dutch Cardiovascular Researcher Fired for Scientific Misconduct | publisher = Forbes | accessdate = Jan 10, 2012 | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryhusten/2011/11/17/prominent-dutch-cardiovascular-researcher-fired-for-scientific-misconduct/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author =Husten, Larry | date = 2011 | title = More Details Emerge about the Dutch Research Scandal | publisher = Forbes | accessdate = Jan 10, 2012 | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryhusten/2011/11/20/more-details-emerge-about-the-dutch-research-scandal/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Erasmus medical centre sacks professor for ‘scientific misconduct’ | date = 2011 | publisher = DutchNews.nl | accessdate = Jan 18, 2012 | url = http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2011/11/erasmus_medical_centre_suspend.php | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111222065836/http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2011/11/erasmus_medical_centre_suspend.php | archivedate = 2011-12-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Berkhout K. |author2=Rosenberg E. | date = 17 November 2011 | title =  Nieuw geval van wetenschapsfraude - hoogleraar Erasmus MC ontslagen  | publisher = nrc.nl | accessdate = January 10, 2012 | url = http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2011/11/17/nieuw-geval-van-wetenschapsfraude-hoogleraar-erasmus-mc-ontslagen }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Erasmus MC Zegt Hoogleraar Ontslag Aan | date = 2011-11-17 | publisher = Rotterdam: Erasmus MC | accessdate = Jan 10, 2012 | url = http://www.erasmusmc.nl/perskamer/archief/2011/3488672/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to investigate this case, Erasmus appointed a Committee for the Investigation of Scientific Integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=van der Maas P.J |author2=Löwenberg B |author3=Peters R.J.G |author4=Rabelink A.J. |author5=Oosting J.M |author6=Juttmann R.E. |author7=Struhkamp R.M. |date=16 Nov 2011 |title=Report Summary |publisher=Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam: Committee for the Investigation of Scientific Integrity |accessdate=Jan 17, 2012 |url=http://www.erasmusmc.nl/5663/135857/3397899/report_summary_investigation_integrity?lang=en }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee found Poldermans to have committed misconduct on several counts. The primary studies that have been brought into question are four of the Dutch Echocardiographic Cardiac Risk Evaluation Applying Stress Echocardiography (DECREASE) studies, specifically DECREASE VI, IV, III, and II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Reducing cardiac risk in non-cardiac surgery: evidence from the DECREASE studies| date =2009 | publisher =European Society of Cardiology | url = http://eurheartjsupp.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/suppl_A/A9.full }}&lt;/ref&gt; DECREASE I was too far in the past to be investigated.

First, some of the randomized controlled trials did not obtain written informed consent from the participants before randomly allocating them to different strategies. These actions were a serious breach of medical research conduct.

Second, the committee determined that the data were not collected according to the protocol described beforehand and reported in the publications. For example, events such as myocardial infarction were not diagnosed by a panel of independent researchers, but by a single person who made no documentation for the reason for the categorisations, which were later found to be contradictory to the patients' own medical records.

Third, the committee determined that, in several cases, these trials had fabricated data.

Last, the committee found that untrustworthy data had been knowingly submitted for publication, another breach of proper scientific conduct.

==After the 2011/2012 investigation==
A project running at the time of the investigation, DECREASE VI, was abandoned, because patients had not given consent to take part. The manner in which previous data was collected, reported, and occasionally fabricated indicates academic misconduct, bringing the legitimacy of the current data into question.

The enquiry decided that DECREASE II need not be retracted because it believed that Dobutamine Stress Echo, the subject of the study, was no longer used in hospitals. This belief appears to be incorrect. DECREASE VI led to two publications, which were also not retracted. No other researchers were disciplined in this inquiry. The Committee informed all parties involved in the funding of the project.

Poldermans was dismissed from his position at Erasmus Medical Center. Two professors will supervise the research done by Poldermans’ students and will establish whether or not the projects in question can be completed successfully. If this is not possible, then the professors will find new research projects for the students affected. Don Poldermans acknowledged the committee’s decision but he claimed that his misconduct was unintended.

Without Poldermans' trials, the remaining credible trials suggest that the recommendation for initiation of a perioperative course of beta blocker seems to increase mortality by 27%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bouri|first=S|author2=Shun-Shin, MJ |author3=Cole, GD |author4=Mayet, J |author5= Francis, DP |title=Meta-analysis of secure randomised controlled trials of β-blockade to prevent perioperative death in non-cardiac surgery.|journal=Heart|date=Jul 31, 2013|pmid=23904357 |doi=10.1136/heartjnl-2013-304262 |volume=100 |pages=456–464 |pmc=3932762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 2014 investigation report==

Erasmus university issued a third investigation report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Erasmus University |title=2014 Report on Academic Conduct |url=http://www.erasmusmc.nl/perskamer/archief/2014/4761230. |accessdate=10 September 2014 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014. This covered DECREASE I which had not been covered in the previous investigations. It stated that the individual patients enrolled in DECREASE I could not be identified for cross-checking against the medical records. It therefore could not conclude on the accuracy or otherwise of the DECREASE I publications. An independent analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cole|first1=GD|last2=Francis|first2=DP|title=Perioperative β blockade: guidelines do not reflect the problems with the evidence from the DECREASE trials.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=Aug 29, 2014|volume=349|pages=g5210|doi=10.1136/bmj.g5210|pmid=25172044|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g5210|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by British researchers listed inconsistencies in the published DECREASE I reports that put their accuracy into doubt.

'''FESOM''' ('''Finite-Element/volumE Sea ice-Ocean Model''') is a
multi-resolution ocean general circulation model that solves the equations 
of motion describing the ocean and sea ice using [[Finite element method|finite-element]] and 
[[Finite volume method|finite-volume]] methods on [[Unstructured grid|unstructured]] computational grids. The model 
is developed and supported by researchers at the [[Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research|Alfred Wegener
Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI)]], in Bremerhaven, 
Germany.

== Overview ==

FESOM implements the idea of using meshes with variable resolution
to simulate the circulation of the global ocean with regional focus. Because
of the broad range of scales characterizing the [[ocean circulation]], downscaling
is commonly needed to describe processes on regional scales. FESOM allows global
multi-resolution cross-scale simulations without traditional nesting.

The dynamical core of the new version  (FESOM2) switches from the [[Finite_element_method|finite-element 
method]] used in the original version of FESOM to the [[Finite volume method|finite-volume method]] for the sake of better computational efficiency. Both versions include the Finite-Element Sea Ice Model (FESIM).&lt;ref name="Danilov2015"&gt;Danilov, S., Q. Wang, R. Timmermann, N. Iakovlev, D. Sidorenko, M. Kimmritz, T. Jung, and  Schröter, J. (2015), Finite-Element Sea Ice Model
(FESIM), version 2, Geosci. Model Dev., 8, 1747–1761, http://www.geosci-model-dev.net/8/1747/2015/&lt;/ref&gt; FESOM is also used as the ocean component of the AWI-CM, the coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model developed at [[Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research|AWI]].

== History ==

The prototype version of FESOM appeared in 2004 due to work of Sergey Danilov,
Gennady Kivman and Jens Schröter. Ralph Timmermann extended it to a full global ocean - sea ice configuration in 2009. Qiang Wang rewrote its numerical algorithm and parameterizations from 2008 through 2014, which led to essentially improved numerical and physical performance. The last release of FESOM with the finite-element dynamical core is FESOM1.4 (Wang et al., 2014).&lt;ref name="Wang2014"&gt;Wang, Q., Danilov, S., Sidorenko, D., Timmermann, R., Wekerle, C., Wang, X., Jung, T., and Schröter, J.

Before the handover of [[Hong Kong]] to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1997, [[medical education]] in this former [[United Kingdom|British]] colony traditionally and exclusively followed the path of western medicine.  Faculties of Medicine were modelled after those in the United Kingdom, and only doctors trained in western medicine were considered "formal" and "reliable."  Chinese medicine practitioners had no formal status at that time.  However, after the return of the territory to China, the practice of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] was further regulated and schools of Chinese Medicine were set up within some of the government funded tertiary institutions in Hong Kong.  The first school of its kind, the School of Chinese Medicine at [[Hong Kong Baptist University]], was established in 1998.  Currently, there are two faculties with academic programmes in western medicine and three schools of Chinese Medicine in the city.

== Western Medicine ==

There are two schools that teach [[Medicine|Western Medicine]] in Hong Kong, namely, the [[Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine]] at the [[University of Hong Kong]] and the [[Faculty of Medicine]] at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]].  The medium of instruction is [[English language|English]].

== Traditional Chinese Medicine ==

There are three public, government funded schools of Traditional Chinese Medicine / [[Pharmacy]] in Hong Kong, including the [[Faculty of Chinese Medicine of Hong Kong Baptist University|School of Chinese Medicine of Hong Kong Baptist University]], the School of Chinese Medicine at the [[University of Hong Kong]], and the School of Chinese Medicine at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]].

There have been 15 versions as of July 2017, many of which are outlined in this article.&lt;ref name=BBC_GZ10/&gt; Galaxy Zoo is part of the [[Zooniverse (citizen science project)|Zooniverse]], a group of citizen science projects. An outcome of the project is to better determine the different aspects of objects and to separate them into classifications.

== Origins ==

[[File:apache-0110.JPG|left|thumb| ARCSAT and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]] telescope buildings at the [[Apache Point Observatory]]]]
A key factor leading to the creation of the project was the problem of what has been referred to as [[data deluge]], where research produces vast sets of information to the extent that research teams are not able to analyse and process much of it.&lt;ref name=eurdeluge&gt;{{cite news|title=Experts want EU to tackle scientific data deluge|url=http://www.euractiv.com/innovation-enterprise/experts-want-eu-tackle-scientifi-news-498556|publisher=EurActiv.com|accessdate=18 July 2014|date=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailydeluge"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110422131123.htm |title=Supercomputers: 'Data Deluge' Is Changing, Expanding Supercomputer-Based Research |last=Zverina |first=Jan  |date=24 April 2011 |publisher=[[Science Daily]] |access-date=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1975296,00.html |title=How to Classify a Million Galaxies in Three Weeks |journal=Time |last=Pinkowski |first=Jennifer |date=28 March 2010 |access-date=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Schawinski]], previously an astrophysicist at [[Oxford University]] and co-founder of Galaxy Zoo, described the problem that led to Galaxy Zoo's creation when he was set the task of classifying the morphology of more than 900,000 galaxies by eye that had been imaged by the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] at the [[Apache Point Observatory]] in [[New Mexico]], [[United States|USA]]. "I classified 50,000 galaxies myself in a week, it was mind-numbing."&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6289474.stm |title=Scientists seek galaxy hunt help |last=McGourty |first=Christine |date=11 July 2007 |access-date=12 July 2007 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Lintott]], also a co-founder of the project, stated: "In many parts of science, we're not constrained by what data we can get, we're constrained by what we can do with the data we have. Citizen science is a very powerful way of solving that problem."&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;

The Galaxy Zoo concept was inspired by others such as [[Stardust@home]], where the public was asked by [[NASA]] to search images obtained from a mission to a [[comet]] for [[interstellar dust]] impacts.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Unlike earlier internet-based citizen science projects such as [[SETI@home]], which used spare computer processing power to analyse data (also known as [[Distributed computing|distributed]] or volunteer computing), Stardust@home involved the active participation of human volunteers to complete the research task.&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070709/full/news070709-7.html |title=See new galaxies – without leaving your chair |journal=News@nature |last=Hopkin |first=Michael |date=11 July 2007 |doi=10.1038/news070709-7 |access-date=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, the Stardust team reported the discovery of first potential interstellar space particles after citizen scientists had looked through more than a million images.&lt;ref name=NASA_SDSP&gt;{{cite press release| | title=Stardust Team Reports Discovery of First Potential Interstellar Space Particles| date=August 14, 2014| publisher=[[NASA]]| url=http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/august/stardust-team-reports-discovery-of-first-potential-interstellar-space-particles/| accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Galaxy Zoo first started, the science team hoped that 20–30,000 people would take part in classifying the 900,000 galaxies that made up the [[Sample (statistics)|sample]].&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; It had been estimated that a perfect graduate student working 24 hours a day 7 days a week would take 3–5 years to classify all the galaxies in the sample once.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; However, in the first Galaxy Zoo, more than 40 million classifications were made in approximately 175 days by more than 100,000 volunteers, providing an average of 38 classifications per galaxy.&lt;ref name="GZ_1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lintott |first=Chris |author-link=Chris Lintott |last2=Schawinski |first2=Kevin |author-link2=Kevin Schawinski |last3=Bamford |first3=Steven |last4=Slosar |first4=Anže |last5=Land |first5=Kate |last6=Thomas |first6=Daniel |last7=Edmondson |first7=Edd |last8=Masters |first8=Karen |last9=Nichol |first9=Robert C. |date=14 December 2010 |orig-year=3 Dec 2010 |title=Galaxy Zoo 1: data release of morphological classifications for nearly 900,000 galaxies |journal=[[MNRAS]] |volume=410 |issue=1 |pages=166–178 |arxiv=1007.3265 |bibcode=2011MNRAS.410..166L |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.17432.x |first10=M.

[[Chris Lintott]] commented that: "One advantage is that you get to see parts of space that have never been seen before. These images were taken by a [[robotic telescope]] and processed automatically, so the odds are that when you log on, that first galaxy you see will be one that no human has seen before."&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; This was confirmed by [[Kevin Schawinski]]: "Most of these galaxies have been photographed by a robotic telescope, and then processed by computer. So this is the first time they will have been seen by human eyes.".&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt;

== Importance of volunteers ==
Galaxy Zoo recruited volunteers to help with the largest galaxy [[census]] ever carried out.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt; Opening the project to the general public saved the professional astronomers the task of studying all the galaxies themselves, resulting in classification of a large number of galaxies undertaken in a shorter time than what smaller research teams would be able to do, classifying 900,000 galaxies in months rather than years if done by smaller research teams.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt; [[Computer program]]s had been unable to reliably classify galaxies: several groups had attempted to develop image-analysis programs.&lt;ref name="clery"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Clery |first=D.  |date=2011 |title=Galaxy Zoo Volunteers Share Pain and Glory of Research |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=333 |issue=6039 |pages=173–175  |bibcode=2011Sci...333..173C |doi=10.1126/science.333.6039.173 |pmid=21737731  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Schawinski]] stated: "The human brain is actually much better than a computer at these [[pattern recognition]] tasks."&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Banerji_1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Banerji |first=M. |last2=Lahav |first2=O. |last3=Lintott |first3=C.

This led volunteers to point out anomalies that on closer inspection have turned out to be new astronomical objects such as '[[Hanny's Voorwerp]]' and '[[Pea galaxy|the Green Pea galaxies]]'.&lt;ref name=clery/&gt; “I’m incredibly impressed by what they’ve managed to achieve,” says University of Oxford astronomer [[Roger Davies (astrophysicist)|Roger Davies]], former president of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]].“They’ve made it possible to do things with a huge survey.”&lt;ref name=clery/&gt;

The Galaxy Zoo forum became a hotbed for the discussion of the SDSS images and more general science questions. Its 'global moderator', [[United Kingdom|UK]] teacher Alice Sheppard, said of it: "I don't quite know what it is, but Galaxy Zoo does something to people. The contributions, both creative and academic, that people have made to the forum are as stunning as the sight of any spiral, and never fail to move me."&lt;ref name="nielsen"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Reinventing Discovery: The New Era of Networked Science |last= Nielsen |first=M. |date=2011 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=978-0-691-14890-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Michael Nielsen]] wrote in his book [[Reinventing Discovery]]: "But Galaxy Zoo can go beyond computers, because it can also apply human intelligence in the analysis, the kind of intelligence that recognizes that Hanny's Voorwerp or a Pea galaxy is out of the ordinary, and deserves further investigation. Galaxy Zoo is thus a hybrid, able to do deep analyses of large data sets that are impossible in any other way."&lt;ref name=nielsen/&gt; A [[community]] feeling was also created. Roger Davies stated: "The community of Galaxy Zoo gives them the opportunity to participate that they’re looking for.”&lt;ref name=clery/&gt; This community became known as the 'Zooites'.&lt;ref name="GalaxyBabe"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-lancashire/plain/A25835880 |title=Galaxy Zoo - Amateurs Analysing Galaxies |last=Croft |first=Ann |date=16 August 2007 |access-date=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Finkbeiner"&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Grand and Bold Thing: An Extraordinary New Map of the Universe Ushering In A New Era of Discovery |last= Finkbeiner |first=A.

They are beautiful, mysterious, and show how amazing our [[universe]] is. It was love at first sight when I started in Galaxy Zoo ... It is a magical place, and it feels like coming home at last."&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nielsen/&gt; The Galaxy Zoo Forum became a read-only [[archive]] in July 2014. After seven years online and over 650,000 posts, it continues to generate science.

== Retired projects ==

=== Galaxy Zoo 1 ===
The original Galaxy Zoo consisted of a data set made up of ≈900,000 galaxies imaged by the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]]. With so many galaxies, it had been assumed that it would take years for visitors to the site to work through them all, but within 24 hours of launch, the website was receiving almost 70,000 classifications an hour. In the end, more than 50 million classifications were received by the project during its first year, contributed by more than 150,000 people. This was started in July 2007 and retired in 2009.&lt;ref name=GZ_1/&gt;

=== Galaxy Zoo 2 ===
This consisted of some 250,000 of the brightest galaxies from the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]].&lt;ref name="GZ_2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Willett |first=Kyle W. |last2=Lintott |first2=Chris J. |author-link2=Chris Lintott |last3=Bamford |first3=Steven P. |last4=Masters |first4=Karen L. |last5=Simmons |first5=Brooke D. |last6=Casteels |first6=Kevin R.

The project closed with some 60 million classifications.&lt;ref name=GZ_2/&gt;

=== Galaxy Zoo mergers ===
This studied the role of interacting galaxies. Interacting galaxies are galaxies that exhibit a gravitational influence on one another. This influence is exhibited over the course of millions or even billions of years as two or more galaxies pass nearby one another. The near passage of two massive structures can cause the galaxies to be distorted and possibly merge. The Galaxy Zoo Mergers aimed to provide a set of tools that allowed users to randomly sample various sets of simulation parameters in rapid succession by showing 8 simulation outputs at a time. This started in November 2009 and was retired in June 2012.&lt;ref name="IOP_merger"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://physicsworld.com/blog/2009/11/galaxy_zoo_mergers.html |title='Galaxy Zoo Mergers' opens today |last=Johnston |first=Hamish |publisher=[[Institute of Physics]] |access-date=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC_merger"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8376566.stm |title=Astronomers release galactic collision game |access-date=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Galaxy Zoo supernovae ===
Galaxy Zoo used images partner from the Palomar Transient Factory to find Supernovae. The task in this Galaxy Zoo project was to help catch exploding stars – supernovae. Data for the site was provided by an automatic survey in California at the Palomar Observatory. Astronomers followed up on the best candidates at telescopes around the world. This started in August 2009 and was retired in August 2012.&lt;ref name="GZ_Supernovae"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first=A.

=== Galaxy Zoo Hubble ===
The site’s third incarnation, Galaxy Zoo Hubble drew from surveys conducted by the Hubble Space Telescope to view earlier epochs of galaxy formation. In these surveys, which involve many days of dedicated observing time, we can see light from galaxies which has taken billions of years to reach us. The idea behind Galaxy Zoo Hubble was to be able to compare galaxies then to galaxies now, giving us a clear understanding of what factors influence their growth, whether through mergers, active black holes or simply star formation. This started in April 2010 and was retired in September 2012.&lt;ref name="Hubble_1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Melvin |first=T. |last2=Masters |first2=K. |last3=Lintott |first3=C. |author-link3=Chris Lintott |last4=Nichol |first4=R.

== Active projects ==

=== Radio Galaxy Zoo ===

{{main| Radio Galaxy Zoo}}
On December 17, 2013, Galaxy Zoo opened a project called Radio Galaxy Zoo. It uses observations from the [[Australian Astronomical Observatory|Australia Telescope Large Area Survey]] in Radio, and compares them to the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]'s infrared data. There are about 6000 images to look through.&lt;ref name="RGZ"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://csiropedia.csiro.au/find-black-holes-while-youre-on-the-bus |title=Find black holes while you're on the bus |date=18 December 2013 |publisher=Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation |access-date=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CSIRO]] press release states that Radio Galaxy Zoo is a new citizen science project that lets anyone become a cosmic explorer. It continues that by matching galaxy images with radio images from CSIRO’s Australia Telescope, a participant can work out if a galaxy has a [[supermassive black hole]].&lt;ref name="RGZ"/&gt;

== Rotation of galaxies ==
[[File:Pinwheel Galaxy CW or ACW.jpg|thumb|[[clockwise|CW]] or [[anticlockwise|ACW]]? This [[Hubble Space Telescope|HST]] image of Messier 101, the [[Pinwheel galaxy]] has it in its normal orientation and then reversed.]]
One of the original aims for Galaxy Zoo was to explore which way galaxies rotated. Cosmologist Kate Land stated: "Some people have argued that galaxies are rotating all in agreement with each other, not randomly as we'd expect. We want people to classify the galaxies according to which way they're rotating and I'll be able to go and see if there's anything bizarre going on. If there are any patterns that we're not expecting, it could really turn up some surprises."&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; In Galaxy Zoo 1, volunteers were asked to judge from the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]] images whether the galaxies were [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical]] or [[spiral galaxy|spiral]] and, if spiral, whether they were rotating in a [[clockwise]] or [[anti-clockwise]] direction. The rotation, also called the [[Chirality]], of galaxies has been examined in several Galaxy Zoo related papers.&lt;ref name=Land_Chirality&gt;{{ cite journal|author1=K. Land |author2=A.

Among the results a psychological bias was demonstrated.&lt;ref name=Land_Chirality/&gt; Galaxy Zoo scientists had wanted to check whether spiral galaxies were evenly distributed or whether there was some intrinsic property of the Universe that caused galaxies to rotate one way or the other. When the Science team came to analyse the results they found an excess of anti-clockwise spinning spiral galaxies.&lt;ref name=Land_Chirality/&gt; But when the team checked this bias by asking volunteers to classify the same image which had then been reversed, there was still an excess of anti-clockwise classifications. This demonstrated that the human brain has real difficultly discerning between something rotating clockwise or anti-clockwise.&lt;ref name=Land_Chirality/&gt; Having measured this effect the team could adjust for it, and went on to establish that spirals which were near each other tended to rotate in the same direction.&lt;ref name=Land_Chirality/&gt;

== Blue ellipticals and red spirals ==

Despite constituting only a minor fraction of the galactic mass (between 0.1% and 0.01% for the Milky Way), dust grains have a major role in shaping the appearance of a galaxy. Because of their dimension (typically smaller than a few tenths of a [[micron]]), they are very effective in absorbing and scattering the radiation emitted by stars in the [[ultraviolet]], [[optics|optical]] and [[near-infrared]].&lt;ref name=ESF_Workshop&gt;{{ cite web| title=Tracing Dust in Spiral Galaxies: radiative transfer studies in the dawn of a new generation of observing facilities| url=http://www.arcetri.astro.it/radtran/sci.html| publisher=[[European Science Foundation]]| date=May 14–16, 2007| accessdate= 22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the interstellar regions are more devoid of matter than any [[vacuum]] artificially created on earth, there is matter in space.

A 2018 study published in the online journal ''Citizen Science: Theory and Practice'' compares two [[citizen science]] projects, Foldit and GZ, to explore the difference between projects that do or don't use gaming to obtain data.&lt;ref name=GIR&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Over a one-year period, the authors conducted a virtual ethnographic study of the public forums of both projects by using [[web scraping]] techniques. The abstract ends: "We conclude that ideals of science embraced by citizen scientists appear to influence the reasons why they participate, either emphasizing equality, like in Galazy Zoo, or meritocracy, like in Foldit."&lt;ref name=GIR/&gt;{{rp|1}}

'''Germania Sacra''' ([[Latin]] for "Sacred/Holy Germania/Germany") is a long-term research project into German [[History of the Roman Catholic Church|church history]] from its beginnings through [[the Reformation]] in the 16th century to the period of [[secularisation]] in the early 19th century.

== History and Structure ==
The first attempt to collect and publish the history of the German dioceses in reference books was made by [[Martin Gerbert]], the prince-abbot of the monastery [[Sankt Blasien|St. Blasien]] in the late 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, but his works were never completed.

Following into Gerberts footsteps, [[Paul Fridolin Kehr]] established a new ''Germania Sacra'' under the patronage of the ''[[Kaiser Wilhelm Society|Kaiser-Wilhelm-Society]]'' at the ''Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institute of German History'' in [[Berlin]] in 1917. He tried to connect the nationwide research projects and combine them under ''Germania Sacra'' to create an archival collection of [[Monastery|monasteries]], [[Convent|convents]], [[Cathedral chapter|cathedral chapters]] and religious dignitaries. After multiple financial problems, the first book was published on 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of June in 1929. It is part of the ''“Alte Folge”'', which comprises seven volumes published between 1929 and 1972.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adw-goe.de/en/research/research-projects-within-the-academies-programme/germania-sacra/publications/|title=Germania Sacra Publications|last=|first=|date=2018-06-27|website=Göttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities; Germania Sacra|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; World War and the death of Kehr, the ''Kaiser-Wilhelm-Society'' wasn’t interested in supporting the institute any longer and the newly founded ''[[Max Planck Society|Max-Planck-Society]]'' took over the patronage of the institute and its project. Hermann Heimpel, the first head of the ''Max-Planck-Institute of History'' in [[Göttingen]], continued work on the ''Germania Sacra'' in 1956, cooperating with an academic director, who coordinated the work of external researchers. While the last books of the ''Alte Folge'' were published between 1966 and 1972, the researchers under Heimpel began writing and publishing the ''Neue Folge'', which were released between 1962 and 2007 in 50 volumes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
In 2007, the ''Max-Planck-Institute of History'' in Göttingen was rededicated and the work on the ''Germania Sacra'' was continued by the''Academy of Sciences and Humanities'' under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Hedwig Röckelein in Göttingen in 2008. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adw-goe.de/en/research/research-projects-within-the-academies-programme/germania-sacra/|title=Germania Sacra|last=|first=|date=2018-06-27|website=Göttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities; Germania Sacra|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The volumes of the ''Germania Sacra'' published after 2008 belong to the ''Dritte Folge'' and currently comprise 14 volumes (as of: June 2018).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In 2015 the first supplementary volume was published, which contains edited preparation work to the main works of ''Germania Sacra''. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Objectives and methods ==
The main objective of ''Germania Sacra'' is a statistical description of the ecclesiastical institutions which existed between the ''[[Holy Roman Empire]]'' and the period of secularisation in the early 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. In achieving that objective, the entirety of sources and secondary literature concerning Medieval and Early Modern ecclesiastical institutions is to be portrayed. These institutions include the [[Diocese|dioceses]] (with focus on the bishops), the [[Cathedral chapter|cathedral chapters]] and the monasteries and convents up to and including their end during the reformation or the secularisation. At the beginning, the collection and the editing of the historical sources was mainly conducted by archivists at the request of Paul Kehr. In the present, the work on ''Germania Sacra'' is divided between historical research and the editorial department. The research is conducted by archivists, historians, members of ecclesiastical orders, theologians etc. 

''Germania Sacras'' publications are divided into the ''Alte Folge'', the ''Neue Folge,'' the ''Dritte Folge,'' the ''Studien zur Germania Sacra'' and the ''Supplementbände zur Germania Sacra''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to the volumes of ''Germania Sacra,'' the project provides two databases. A comprehensive inventory of medieval and early modern clerics &lt;ref&gt;http://personendatenbank.germania-sacra.de&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Database of monasteries, convents and collegiate churches of the Old Empire "&lt;ref&gt;http://klosterdatenbank.germania-sacra.de&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Biotechnology]]''' is the application of scientific and engineering principles to the processing of materials by biological agents to provide goods and services.&lt;ref name="bud"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bud|first1=Robert|last2=Cantley|first2=Mark F.|title=The Uses of Life: A History of Biotechnology|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London|isbn=9780521476997|pages=1, 6, 7, 30, 133, 135, 138, 141–142, 155, 171–173, 165, 167, 174, 177, &amp; 191|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGFQNf_PcPwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its inception, biotechnology has maintained a close relationship with society. Although now most often associated with the development of [[drug]]s, historically biotechnology has been principally associated with food, addressing such issues as [[malnutrition]] and [[famine]]. The history of [[biotechnology]] begins with [[Zymology|zymotechnology]], which commenced with a focus on [[brewing]] techniques for beer. By World War I, however, zymotechnology would expand to tackle larger industrial issues, and the potential of [[industrial fermentation]] gave rise to biotechnology. However, both the single-cell protein and gasohol projects failed to progress due to varying issues including public resistance, a changing economic scene, and shifts in political power.

Yet the formation of a new field, [[genetic engineering]], would soon bring biotechnology to the forefront of science in society, and the intimate relationship between the scientific community, the public, and the government would ensue. These debates gained exposure in 1975 at the [[Asilomar Conference]], where [[Joshua Lederberg]] was the most outspoken supporter for this emerging field in biotechnology. By as early as 1978, with the development of synthetic human [[insulin]], Lederberg's claims would prove valid, and the biotechnology industry grew rapidly. Each new scientific advance became a media event designed to capture public support, and by the 1980s, biotechnology grew into a promising real industry. In 1988, only five proteins from genetically engineered cells had been approved as drugs by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), but this number would skyrocket to over 125 by the end of the 1990s.

The field of genetic engineering remains a heated topic of discussion in today's society with the advent of [[gene therapy]], [[stem cell research]], [[cloning]], and [[genetically modified food]]. While it seems only natural nowadays to link pharmaceutical drugs as solutions to health and societal problems, this relationship of biotechnology serving social needs began centuries ago.

==Origins of biotechnology==
Biotechnology arose from the field of zymotechnology or zymurgy, which began as a search for a better understanding of industrial fermentation, particularly beer. Beer was an important industrial, and not just social, commodity. In late 19th-century Germany, [[brewing]] contributed as much to the gross national product as steel, and taxes on alcohol proved to be significant sources of revenue to the government.&lt;ref name="Thackray"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thackray|first1=Arnold|title=Private Science: Biotechnology and the Rise of the Molecular Sciences|date=1998|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780812234282|pages=6–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TmUX5DUTldwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s, institutes and remunerative consultancies were dedicated to the technology of brewing. The most famous was the private Carlsberg Institute, founded in 1875, which employed Emil Christian Hansen, who pioneered the pure yeast process for the reliable production of consistent beer. Less well known were private consultancies that advised the brewing industry. One of these, the Zymotechnic Institute, was established in Chicago by the German-born chemist John Ewald Siebel.

The heyday and expansion of zymotechnology came in World War I in response to industrial needs to support the war. [[Max Delbrück (chemist)|Max Delbrück]] grew yeast on an immense scale during the war to meet 60 percent of Germany's animal feed needs.&lt;ref name="Thackray" /&gt; Compounds of another fermentation product, [[lactic acid]], made up for a lack of hydraulic fluid, [[glycerol]]. On the Allied side the Russian chemist [[Chaim Weizmann]] used starch to eliminate Britain's shortage of [[acetone]], a key raw material for [[cordite]], by fermenting maize to acetone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Sifniades|first1=Stylianos|last2=Levy|first2=Alan B.|title=Acetone|journal=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|date=2000|doi=10.1002/14356007.a01_079|isbn=978-3527306732}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industrial potential of [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] was outgrowing its traditional home in brewing, and "zymotechnology" soon gave way to "biotechnology."

With food shortages spreading and resources fading, some dreamed of a new industrial solution. The Hungarian [[Károly Ereky]] coined the word "biotechnology" in Hungary during 1919 to describe a technology based on converting raw materials into a more useful product. He built a slaughterhouse for a thousand pigs and also a fattening farm with space for 50,000 pigs, raising over 100,000 pigs a year. The enterprise was enormous, becoming one of the largest and most profitable meat and fat operations in the world. In a book entitled ''Biotechnologie'', Ereky further developed a theme that would be reiterated through the 20th century: biotechnology could provide solutions to societal crises, such as food and energy shortages. For Ereky, the term "biotechnologie" indicated the process by which raw materials could be biologically upgraded into socially useful products.&lt;ref name="Fiechter"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fiechter|first1=A.|last2=Beppu|first2=T.|title=History of Modern Biotechnology I|date=2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|location=Berlin|isbn=9783540677932|pages=153 &amp; 170|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ha6RNLb_UFQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This catchword spread quickly after the First World War, as "biotechnology" entered German dictionaries and was taken up abroad by business-hungry private consultancies as far away as the United States. In Chicago, for example, the coming of [[prohibition]] at the end of World War I encouraged biological industries to create opportunities for new fermentation products, in particular a market for nonalcoholic drinks. Emil Siebel, the son of the founder of the Zymotechnic Institute, broke away from his father's company to establish his own called the "Bureau of Biotechnology," which specifically offered expertise in fermented nonalcoholic drinks.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

The belief that the needs of an industrial society could be met by fermenting agricultural waste was an important ingredient of the "chemurgic movement."&lt;ref name="Fiechter" /&gt;  Fermentation-based processes generated products of ever-growing utility. In the 1940s, [[penicillin]] was the most dramatic. While it was discovered in England, it was produced industrially in the U.S. using a deep fermentation process originally developed in Peoria, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gordon|first1=J.

Doctors used the phrase "miracle drug", and the historian of its wartime use, David Adams, has suggested that to the public penicillin represented the perfect health that went together with the car and the dream house of wartime American advertising.&lt;ref name="Thackray" /&gt;  Beginning in the 1950s, fermentation technology also became advanced enough to produce [[steroids]] on industrially significant scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Capek|first1=Milantadra|last2=Oldrich|first2=Hanc|last3=Alois|first3=Capek|title=Microbial Transformations of Steroids|date=1966|publisher=Academia Publishing House of Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences|location=Prague|isbn=9789401176057|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-7603-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular importance was the improved [[semisynthesis]] of [[cortisone]] which simplified the old 31 step synthesis to 11 steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leigh|first1=H.

[[File:Penicillin cures gonorrhea.jpg|thumb|left| [[Penicillin]] was viewed as a miracle drug that brought enormous profits and public expectations.]]

==Single-cell protein and gasohol projects==
Even greater expectations of biotechnology were raised during the 1960s by a process that grew single-cell protein. When the so-called protein gap threatened world hunger, producing food locally by growing it from waste seemed to offer a solution. It was the possibilities of growing microorganisms on oil that captured the imagination of scientists, policy makers, and commerce.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Major companies such as [[British Petroleum]] (BP) staked their futures on it. In 1962, BP built a pilot plant at Cap de Lavera in Southern France to publicize its product, Toprina.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Initial research work at Lavera was done by [[Alfred Champagnat]],&lt;ref name=bamberg&gt;{{cite book|first=J. H. |last=Bamberg |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000|pages=426–428|isbn=978-0-521-78515-0|title=British Petroleum and global oil, 1950-1975: the challenge of nationalism. Volume 3 of British Petroleum and Global Oil 1950-1975: The Challenge of Nationalism, J. H. Bamberg British Petroleum series|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LVC0VlPOJxEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, construction started on BP's second pilot plant at [[Grangemouth Refinery|Grangemouth Oil Refinery]] in Britain.&lt;ref name=bamberg/&gt;

As there was no well-accepted term to describe the new foods, in 1966 the term "[[single-cell protein]]" (SCP) was coined at [[MIT]] to provide an acceptable and exciting new title, avoiding the unpleasant connotations of microbial or bacterial.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

The "food from oil" idea became quite popular by the 1970s, when  facilities for growing yeast fed by n-[[Alkane|paraffin]]s were built in a number of countries. The [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] were particularly enthusiastic, opening large "BVK" (''belkovo-vitaminny kontsentrat'', i.e., "protein-vitamin concentrate") plants next to their oil refineries in [[Kstovo]] (1973) &lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0612FD3C55137B93C2A8178AD95F478785F9 Soviet Plant to Convert Oil to Protein for Feed; Use of Yeast Involved], By THEODORE SHABAD. the New York Times, November 10, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kstovo.ru/index-name-Content-op-view-id-41.html Первенец микробиологической промышленности] (Microbiological industry's first plant), in: Станислав Марков (Stanislav Markov) «Кстово – молодой город России» (''Kstovo, Russia's Young City'')&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kirishi]] (1974).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

By the late 1970s, however, the cultural climate had completely changed, as the growth in SCP interest had taken place against a shifting economic and cultural scene (136). First, the [[price of oil]] rose catastrophically in 1974, so that its cost per barrel was five times greater than it had been two years earlier. Second, despite continuing hunger around the world, anticipated demand also began to shift from humans to animals. The program had begun with the vision of growing food for Third World people, yet the product was instead launched as an animal food for the developed world. The rapidly rising demand for animal feed made that market appear economically more attractive. The ultimate downfall of the SCP project, however, came from public resistance.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

This was particularly vocal in Japan, where production came closest to fruition. For all their enthusiasm for innovation and traditional interest in microbiologically produced foods, the Japanese were the first to ban the production of single-cell proteins. The Japanese ultimately were unable to separate the idea of their new "natural" foods from the far from natural connotation of oil.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; These arguments were made against a background of suspicion of heavy industry in which anxiety over minute traces of [[petroleum]] was expressed. Thus, public resistance to an unnatural product led to the end of the SCP project as an attempt to solve world hunger.

Also, in 1989 in the USSR, the public environmental concerns made the government decide to close down (or convert to different technologies) all 8 paraffin-fed-yeast plants that the Soviet Ministry of Microbiological Industry had by that time.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In the late 1970s, biotechnology offered another possible solution to a societal crisis. The escalation in the price of oil in 1974 increased the cost of the Western world's energy tenfold.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; In response, the U.S. government promoted the production of [[gasohol]], gasoline with 10 percent alcohol added, as an answer to the energy crisis.&lt;ref name="Thackray" /&gt; In 1979, when the Soviet Union sent troops to Afghanistan, the Carter administration cut off its supplies to agricultural produce in retaliation, creating a surplus of agriculture in the U.S. As a result, fermenting the agricultural surpluses to synthesize fuel seemed to be an economical solution to the shortage of oil threatened by the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. Before the new direction could be taken, however, the political wind changed again: the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration came to power in January 1981 and, with the declining oil prices of the 1980s, ended support for the gasohol industry before it was born.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

Biotechnology seemed to be the solution for major social problems, including world hunger and energy crises. In the 1960s, radical measures would be needed to meet world starvation, and biotechnology seemed to provide an answer. However, the solutions proved to be too expensive and socially unacceptable, and solving world hunger through SCP food was dismissed. In the 1970s, the food crisis was succeeded by the energy crisis, and here too, biotechnology seemed to provide an answer. But once again, costs proved prohibitive as oil prices slumped in the 1980s. Thus, in practice, the implications of biotechnology were not fully realized in these situations. But this would soon change with the rise of [[genetic engineering]].

==Genetic engineering==
The origins of biotechnology culminated with the birth of [[genetic engineering]]. There were two key events that have come to be seen as scientific breakthroughs beginning the era that would unite genetics with biotechnology. One was the 1953 discovery of the structure of [[DNA]], by Watson and Crick, and the other was the 1973 discovery by Cohen and Boyer of a [[recombinant DNA]] technique by which a section of DNA was cut from the plasmid of an E. coli bacterium and transferred into the DNA of another.&lt;ref name="Grace" /&gt; This approach could, in principle, enable bacteria to adopt the genes and produce proteins of other organisms, including humans. Popularly referred to as "genetic engineering," it came to be defined as the basis of new biotechnology.

Genetic engineering proved to be a topic that thrust biotechnology into the public scene, and the interaction between scientists, politicians, and the public defined the work that was accomplished in this area. Technical developments during this time were revolutionary and at times frightening. In December 1967, the first heart transplant by Christian Barnard reminded the public that the physical identity of a person was becoming increasingly problematic. While poetic imagination had always seen the heart at the center of the soul, now there was the prospect of individuals being defined by other people's hearts.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;  During the same month, [[Arthur Kornberg]] announced that he had managed to biochemically replicate a viral gene. "Life had been synthesized," said the head of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Genetic engineering was now on the scientific agenda, as it was becoming possible to identify genetic characteristics with diseases such as [[beta thalassemia]] and [[sickle-cell anemia]].

Responses to scientific achievements were colored by cultural skepticism. Scientists and their expertise were looked upon with suspicion. In 1968, an immensely popular work, ''The Biological Time Bomb'', was written by the British journalist Gordon Rattray Taylor. The author's preface saw Kornberg's discovery of replicating a viral gene as a route to lethal doomsday bugs. The publisher's blurb for the book warned that within ten years, "You may marry a semi-artificial man or woman…choose your children's sex…tune out pain…change your memories…and live to be 150 if the scientific revolution doesn’t destroy us first."&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; The book ended with a chapter called "The Future – If Any." While it is rare for current science to be represented in the movies, in this period of "[[Star Trek]]", science fiction and science fact seemed to be converging. "[[Cloning]]" became a popular word in the media. [[Woody Allen]] satirized the cloning of a person from a nose in his 1973 movie ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'', and cloning [[Adolf Hitler]] from surviving cells was the theme of the 1976 novel by [[Ira Levin]], ''[[The Boys from Brazil (novel)|The Boys from Brazil]]''.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt;

In response to these public concerns, scientists, industry, and governments increasingly linked the power of [[recombinant DNA]] to the immensely practical functions that biotechnology promised. One of the key scientific figures that attempted to highlight the promising aspects of genetic engineering was [[Joshua Lederberg]], a Stanford professor and [[Nobel laureate]]. While in the 1960s "genetic engineering" described eugenics and work involving the manipulation of the [[human genome]], Lederberg stressed research that would involve microbes instead.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Lederberg emphasized the importance of focusing on curing living people. Lederberg's 1963 paper, "Biological Future of Man" suggested that, while molecular biology might one day make it possible to change the human genotype, "what we have overlooked is [[euphenics]], the engineering of human development."&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Lederberg constructed the word "euphenics" to emphasize changing the [[phenotype]] after conception rather than the [[genotype]] which would affect future generations.

With the discovery of [[recombinant DNA]] by Cohen and Boyer in 1973, the idea that genetic engineering would have major human and societal consequences was born. In July 1974, a group of eminent molecular biologists headed by Paul Berg wrote to ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' suggesting that the consequences of this work were so potentially destructive that there should be a pause until its implications had been thought through.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; This suggestion was explored at a meeting in February 1975 at California's Monterey Peninsula, forever immortalized by the location, [[Asilomar Conference Grounds|Asilomar]]. Its historic outcome was an unprecedented call for a halt in research until it could be regulated in such a way that the public need not be anxious, and it led to a 16-month moratorium until [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) guidelines were established.

[[Joshua Lederberg]] was the leading exception in emphasizing, as he had for years, the potential benefits. At [[Asilomar Conference Grounds|Asilomar]], in an atmosphere favoring control and regulation, he circulated a paper countering the pessimism and fears of misuses with the benefits conferred by successful use. He described "an early chance for a technology of untold importance for diagnostic and therapeutic medicine: the ready production of an unlimited variety of human [[proteins]]. Analogous applications may be foreseen in [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] process for cheaply manufacturing essential nutrients, and in the improvement of [[microbes]] for the production of [[antibiotics]] and of special industrial chemicals."&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; In June 1976, the 16-month moratorium on research expired with the Director's Advisory Committee (DAC) publication of the NIH guidelines of good practice. They defined the risks of certain kinds of experiments and the appropriate physical conditions for their pursuit, as well as a list of things too dangerous to perform at all. Moreover, [[modified organisms]] were not to be tested outside the confines of a laboratory or allowed into the environment.&lt;ref name="Grace" /&gt;

[[File:Insulincrystals.jpg|thumb|Synthetic [[insulin]] crystals synthesized using [[recombinant DNA]] technology]]

Atypical as Lederberg was at Asilomar, his optimistic vision of [[genetic engineering]] would soon lead to the development of the biotechnology industry. Over the next two years, as public concern over the dangers of [[recombinant DNA]] research grew, so too did interest in its technical and practical applications. Curing genetic diseases remained in the realms of science fiction, but it appeared that producing human simple proteins could be good business. [[Insulin]], one of the smaller,  best characterized and understood proteins, had been used in treating [[type 1 diabetes]] for a half century. It had been extracted from animals in a chemically slightly different form from the human product. Yet, if one could produce synthetic [[human insulin]], one could meet an existing demand with a product whose approval would be relatively easy to obtain from regulators. In the period 1975 to 1977, synthetic "human" insulin represented the aspirations for new products that could be made with the new biotechnology. Microbial production of synthetic human insulin was finally announced in September 1978 and was produced by a startup company, [[Genentech]].&lt;ref name="Krimsky"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krimsky|first1=Sheldon|title=Biotechnics &amp; society: the rise of industrial genetics|date=1991|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|isbn=9780275938598|pages=18, &amp; 21|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8-XbAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=027593859X&amp;dq=027593859X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although that company did not commercialize the product themselves, instead, it licensed the production method to [[Eli Lilly and Company]].  1978 also saw the first application for a patent on a gene, the gene which produces [[human growth hormone]], by the [[University of California]], thus introducing the legal principle that genes could be patented. Since that filing, almost 20% of the more than 20,000 genes in the human DNA have been patented.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The radical shift in the connotation of "genetic engineering" from an emphasis on the inherited characteristics of people to the commercial production of proteins and therapeutic drugs was nurtured by Joshua Lederberg. His broad concerns since the 1960s had been stimulated by enthusiasm for science and its potential medical benefits. Countering calls for strict regulation, he expressed a vision of potential utility. Against a belief that new techniques would entail unmentionable and uncontrollable consequences for humanity and the environment, a growing consensus on the economic value of recombinant DNA emerged.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Biotechnology and industry==
[[File:South San Francisco gateway sign.jpg|thumb|right|A Genentech-sponsored sign declaring South San Francisco to be "The Birthplace of Biotechnology."]]
With ancestral roots in [[industrial microbiology]] that date back centuries, the new biotechnology industry grew rapidly beginning in the mid-1970s. Each new scientific advance became a media event designed to capture investment confidence and public support.&lt;ref name="Krimsky" /&gt;  Although market expectations and social benefits of new products were frequently overstated, many people were prepared to see genetic engineering as the next great advance in technological progress. By the 1980s, biotechnology characterized a nascent real industry, providing titles for emerging trade organizations such as the [[Biotechnology Industry Organization]] (BIO).

The main focus of attention after insulin were the potential profit makers in the pharmaceutical industry: [[human growth hormone]] and what promised to be a miraculous cure for viral diseases, [[interferon]]. [[Cancer]] was a central target in the 1970s because increasingly the disease was linked to viruses.&lt;ref name="Grace"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grace|first1=Eric S.|title=Biotechnology Unzipped:: Promises and Realities|date=2006|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9780309096218|pages=78 &amp; 155|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NtOv07UmQgAC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1980, a new company, [[Biogen]], had produced [[interferon]] through recombinant DNA. The emergence of interferon and the possibility of curing cancer raised money in the community for research and increased the enthusiasm of an otherwise uncertain and tentative society. Moreover, to the 1970s plight of cancer was added [[AIDS]] in the 1980s, offering an enormous potential market for a successful therapy, and more immediately, a market for diagnostic tests based on monoclonal antibodies.&lt;ref name="Colwell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rita R|first1=Colwell|title=Fulfilling the promise of biotechnology|journal=Biotechnology Advances|date=2002|volume=20|issue=3–4|pages=215–228|doi=10.1016/S0734-9750(02)00011-3|pmid=14550029}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1988, only five proteins from genetically engineered cells had been approved as drugs by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA): synthetic [[insulin]], [[human growth hormone]], [[hepatitis B vaccine]], [[alpha-interferon]], and [[tissue plasminogen activator]] (TPa), for lysis of blood clots. By the end of the 1990s, however, 125 more genetically engineered drugs would be approved.&lt;ref name="Colwell" /&gt;

The 2007–2008 [[global financial crisis]] led to several changes in the way the biotechnology industry was financed and organized. First, it led to a decline in overall financial investment in the sector, globally; and second, in some countries like the UK it led to a shift from business strategies focused on going for an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) to seeking a [[trade sale]] instead.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Birch|first=Kean|date=2016-08-10|title=Rethinking Value in the Bio-economy|journal=Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=460–490|doi=10.1177/0162243916661633|pmid=28458406|pmc=5390941}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, financial investment in the biotechnology industry started to improve again and by 2014 the global market capitalization reached $1 trillion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Genetic engineering also reached the agricultural front as well. There was tremendous progress since the market introduction of the genetically engineered [[Flavr Savr tomato]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="Colwell" /&gt;  Ernst and Young reported that in 1998, 30% of the U.S. soybean crop was expected to be from genetically engineered seeds. In 1998, about 30% of the US cotton and corn crops were also expected to be products of [[genetic engineering]].&lt;ref name="Colwell" /&gt;

Genetic engineering in biotechnology stimulated hopes for both therapeutic proteins, drugs and biological organisms themselves, such as seeds, pesticides, engineered yeasts, and modified human cells for treating genetic diseases. From the perspective of its commercial promoters, scientific breakthroughs, industrial commitment, and official support were finally coming together, and biotechnology became a normal part of business. No longer were the proponents for the economic and technological significance of biotechnology the iconoclasts.&lt;ref name="bud" /&gt; Their message had finally become accepted and incorporated into the policies of governments and industry.

==Global trends==
{{Refimprove|date=November 2006}}
According to Burrill and Company, an industry investment bank, over $350 billion has been invested in biotech since the emergence of the industry, and global revenues rose from $23 billion in 2000 to more than $50 billion in 2005. The greatest growth has been in [[Latin America]] but all regions of the world have shown strong growth trends.  By 2007 and into 2008, though, a downturn in the fortunes of biotech emerged, at least in the United Kingdom, as the result of declining investment in the face of failure of biotech pipelines to deliver and a consequent downturn in return on investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pearson |first=Sue |date=2008-08-01 |title=Is the U.K. Biotech Industry on the Skids? |journal=Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News |volume=28 |issue=14 |pages=12–13 |url=http://www.genengnews.com/articles/chitem.aspx?aid=2546&amp;chid=0 |issn=1935-472X|accessdate =2008-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Implicit cognition''' refers to unconscious influences such as [[knowledge]], [[perception]], or [[memory]], that influence a person's [[behavior]], even though they themselves have no conscious awareness whatsoever of those influences.&lt;ref name="ReingoldRay2006"/&gt;

==Overview==
Implicit cognition is everything one does and learns unconsciously or without any awareness that one is doing it. An example of implicit cognition could be when a person first learns to ride a bike: at first they are aware that they are learning the required skills. After having stopped for many years, when the person starts to ride the bike again they do not have to relearn the motor skills required, as their implicit knowledge of the motor skills&lt;ref name=Baddeley1997/&gt; takes over and they can just start riding the bike as if they had never stopped. In other words, they do not have to think about the actions that they are performing in order to ride the bike. It can be seen with this example that implicit cognition is involved with many of the different mental activities and everyday situations of people's daily lives.&lt;ref name=GrafMasson1993/&gt; There are many processes in which implicit memory works, which include learning, our social cognition, and our problem solving skills.

==History==
Implicit cognition was first discovered in the year of 1649 by [[Descartes]] in his ''[[Passions of the Soul]]''. He said in one of his writings that he saw that unpleasant childhood experiences remain imprinted in a child's brain until its death without any conscious memory of it remaining.&lt;ref name=Schacter1987/&gt; Even though this idea was never accepted by any of his peers, in 1704 [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in his ''[[New Essays Concerning Human Understanding]]'' stressed the importance of unconscious perceptions which he said were the ideas that we are not consciously aware of yet still influence people's behavior.&lt;ref name=Schacter1987/&gt; He claimed that people have residual effects of prior impressions without any remembrance of them. In 1802&lt;!--Schachter 1987 incorrectly gives 1804, but the book was published in 1802--&gt; French philosopher [[Maine de Biran]] in his ''The Influence of Habit on the Faculty of Thinking'' was the first person after Leibniz to systematically discuss implicit memory stating that after enough repetition, a habit can become automatic or completed without any conscious awareness.&lt;ref name=Schacter1987/&gt; In 1870 [[Ewald Hering]] said that it was essential to consider unconscious memory, which is involved in involuntary recall, and the development of automatic and unconscious habitual actions.&lt;ref name=Schacter1987/&gt;

==Implicit learning==
Implicit learning starts in our early childhood, this means that people are not able to learn the proper grammar and rules to speaking a language until the age of seven. So if this is the case then how do we learn to talk by the age of four? One of the ways that this is possible is through implicit learning and association. Children learn their first language from what they hear when they are listening to the adults and through their own talking activities.&lt;ref name=Howes2007/&gt; This goes to show that the way children learn language involves implicit learning.

===Studies on implicit learning===
A study was conducted with amnesiac patients in an attempt to demonstrate that amnesiac patients that were unable to learn a list of words or pictures when their performance was tested were able to complete or put together fragmented words and incomplete pictures. This was found to be true as the patients were able to perform better when asked to complete words or pictures. A possible explanation for this could be that implicit memory should be less susceptible to damage that may happen to the brain than explicit memory.&lt;ref name=Howes2007/&gt; There was a case where a 54-year-old man that had bitemporal damage worse on the right side had a hard time remembering things from his own life as well as famous events, names and even; yet he was able to perform within the normal limits with a word completion task involving famous names and with judgments of famous faces.&lt;ref name=Baddeley2002/&gt; This is a prime example that implicit memory can be less vulnerable to brain damage.

A famous study investigated the Identification blindsight effect with individuals who had suffered damage to one half of the visual cortex and were blind in the opposite half of the visual field.&lt;ref name=GrafMasson1993/&gt; It was discovered that when objects or pictures were shown to these blind areas, the participants said that they saw no object or picture, but a certain number were able to identify the stimulus as either a cross or circle when asked to guess at a considerably higher rate than would have been expected by chance.&lt;ref name=Howes2007/&gt; The reason that this happened is because the information was able to be process through the first three stages of selection, organization, and interpretation or comprehension of the perceptual cycle but failed at only the last stage of retention and memory where the identified image is entered into their awareness. Thus stimuli can enter implicit memory even when people are unable to consciously perceive them.

==Implicit social relations==
Implicit cognition also plays a role in social cognition. People tend to see objects and individuals as more encouraging or acceptable the more often&lt;ref name=GrafMasson1993/&gt; that people are exposed to them. An example includes the False-fame Effect.&lt;ref name=GrafMasson1993/&gt; Graf and Masson (1993) conducted a study where they showed participants a list with both famous and non-famous names. When it was shown around people were able to recall the famous names more than the non-famous names initially, but after about a 24-hour delay participants began to associate the non-famous names with famous people. This supports implicit cognition because the participants began to unconsciously associate the non-famous names with famous people.

Although the process is unconscious, implicit cognition influences how people view each other as well as their interactions with one another. People tend to view those who look alike as belonging together or to similar groups&lt;ref name=WegnerVallacher1977/&gt; and associate them with the social groups that existed in their high school years. These groups represented different relations between the students and were made up of students who were perceived as having similarities among each other. 
A study was conducted to see the amount of distance that participants put between individuals given certain circumstances. The participants were asked to place figures of individuals where they thought the figures should be standing given certain circumstances. It was found that people typically place men and women close to each other, to make little families formed with the figures of a woman, a man and of children.&lt;ref name=WegnerVallacher1977/&gt; The participants did the same when asked to show friends and/or acquaintances, the two figures were placed relatively close to one another rather than if they were asked to represent strangers. When asked to represent strangers the participants placed the figures far apart. There are two parts to the social relations view that is liking relations were the ultimate goal is to be together, then there is the disliking relation view which is separation from the person.&lt;ref name=WegnerVallacher1977/&gt; An example of this could be when someone is walking down a hall way and see someone whom they know and like that person is more likely to wave and say hello to them. On the other hand, say the person they see is someone whom they dislike, their response will be the opposite as they try to either avoid them or get away from them as quickly as possible showing the separation between the two of them. There are two views to the social relations theory, one of them is that people are out to mainly seek dominance of those around them, while the other view is that people mainly see the relations as either belonging or not belonging or liking and disliking on another. It is seen that males mainly seek dominance against one another as they are competitive and looking to outdo one another. For females on the other hand it is seen that women perceive their social views and values as more of the belonging or liking scale in terms of their closeness to one another. Implicit cognition not only involved how people view each other but also how they view themselves. This means that our own image is constructed from what others see of us&lt;ref name=WegnerVallacher1977/&gt; rather than our own views. The way that we view ourselves is from what others see us as, or from the times that we compare ourselves to other people.  The way that this plays a role in implicit cognition is because all of these actions people do unconsciously, or they are unaware that they are making these decision. Men do not consciously seek to be dominant over one another as women do not consciously arrange their social views or values in terms of their closeness. These are each things that people do without their conscious knowledge of these actions, which ties in with implicit cognition.

==Implicit behaviors==
{{tone|section|date=May 2016}}
There are scenarios when we act on something and then think back about handling it in different situation or manner. That is implicit cognition coming into play, the mind will then go based off ethical and similar situations when interacting with a certain thought. Implicit cognition and its automated thought process allows a person to decide something out of impulse. It is often defined as an involuntary process where tasks are easily absent of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Graf, P, &amp; Schacter, D, L., (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; There are plenty of factors that influence behaviors and thought processes. Such as social learning, to stigmas, and two major aspects of implicit and explicit cognition. Implicit on one hand is obtained through social aspects and association, while explicit cognition is gained through propositional attitudes or beliefs of certain thoughts,&lt;ref&gt;Gawronski, B, &amp; Bodenhausen, G, V., (2006); Wilson, T. D., Lindsey, S., &amp; Schooler, T. Y. (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Implicit cognition can be incorporated with a mixture of attention, goals, self-association, and at times even motivational processes. Researchers have used different methods to test these theories of behavior correlation with implicit cognition. Using Implicit Association Tests (ITA's) is a method that is significantly used, according to Fazio &amp; Olsen (2003) and Richetin &amp; Richardson (2008). Since published, approximately ten years or so, it has been widely used influencing research on implicit attitudes. Implicit cognition is a process based off automatic mental interpretations. It's what a person really thinks, yet is not consciously aware of. Behavior is then affected, usually causing negative influences, both theoretically and empirical reasons presume that automatic cognitive processes are contributed to aggressive behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, C, A., et al. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Impulse behaviors are often created without awareness. Negativity is a characteristic of implicit cognition, since it is an automated response. Explicit cognition is rarely used when trying to discover behavior of ones thought process. Researchers again use IAT's to determine ones thoughts and how a person incorporates these automatic processes, findings consider that implicit cognition may direct what behaviors a person may choose when facing extreme stimuli. For example, death can be perceived as positive, negative, or a combination of the two.  Depending on the attributes of death, it can include a general perspective or a "me" attribute. {{harvtxt|Nock et al.|2010}} implied that implicit association with death and or suicide initiates a final process when deciding how to cope to these extreme measures. Self- harm is another characteristic associated with implicit cognition. Because although we may think of it, it is controlled subconsciously. IAT's showed that there was a stronger correlation of implicit cognition and death/suicide than self-harm. The idea of pain may influence a person to think twice, while suicidal may seem quick, thus the automatic process can show how effective this negative behavior and implicit cognition come hand in hand. Automated processes doesn't allow a person to thoroughly create a conscious choice, therefore creating negative influence to behavior. Another negative behavior that can be associated with implicit cognition is depression. Whether a person takes a positive or negative outlook on the certain situation can produce if a person will be associated with depression. It is easier to determine an implicit mindset simple because it is outside of awareness. Implicit processes are considered critical when determining a person's reactions to a certain schema. Implicit cognition is often immediately affective towards a person's reaction.{{sfn|Haeffel et al.|2007}} Implicit cognitions also consisted of negative schemas that included hidden cognitive frameworks, and activation of stress. Awareness was often misinterpreted and implicit cognition emerged because of these negative schemas.&lt;ref&gt;(Scher, C, D., Ingram, R, E., &amp; Sega S, V., 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviors merged through implicit cognition involve a variety of addictive behaviors, problematic thinking, depression, aggression, suicide, death, and other negative factors. Certain life situations add to this schema, whether it be stressful situations, sudden, or anything along these lines, aspects of implicit cognition are used and evaluated.

Implicit cognition can also be associated with mental illness and the way thoughts are processed. Automatic stigmas and attitudes may anticipate other cognitive and behavior tendencies. A person with mental illness may be correlated with a guilt-related, self-associated personality.&lt;ref&gt;Dovidio, J, F., et al., (2002) &amp; Greenwald, A, G., et al., (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these associations it may be managed outside one's own control and awareness, showing how implicit cognition is affected. However a dual process can be assessed within implicit and explicit cognition. An agreement between the two thought processes may be an issue, explicit may not be in contact with implicit, therefore causing more of a problem. Mental illness can include both implicit and explicit attitudes, however implicit self-concepts gave more negative consequence when dealing with mental illness. Much of implicit problems happened to be associated with alcohol, however this isn't the goal in order to describe a mental process and implicit cognition. The most widely influenced mental illness in association with implicit cognition would be Schizophrenia. Since a person of this illness has a problem of detecting what is real and what is not, implicit memory is often used with these patients. However, since it cannot really be detected if it is emotionally, mentally, or a combination of both some aspects of this illness are usually exercised uninterrupted, and unconsciously.{{sfn|Mano|Brown|2013}} Since schizophrenia is widely varied and has different characteristics, we cannot quite measure the outcome of implicit cognition.

==Definition==
Implicit cognition refers to perceptual, memory, comprehension, and performance processes that occur through unconscious awareness.{{sfn|Sun|2001}} For example, when a patient is discharged after a surgery, the effects of the anesthesia can cause abnormal behaviors without any conscious awareness. According to Wiers et al. (2006) some scholars argue implicit cognition is misinterpreted and could be used to improve behaviors while others highlight the dangers of it. Research studies have shown implicit cognition is a strong predictor for several issues like substance abuse, misconduct, and mental disorders.{{sfn|Wiers|Stacy|2006b}} These inherent thoughts are influenced from early adolescent experiences primarily a negative impact from culture. Adolescents who experience a rough childhood early on develop low levels of self-esteem. Therefore, the cognition to act dangerously is an oblivious development. Research for implicit cognition has started to grow especially within mental disorders.

==In mental disorders==
Schemas are used to interpret the functions involved when individuals would make sense of their surroundings. This cognition happens through an explicit process of recalling an item routinely or implicit process that is outside conscious awareness control. A recent study suggests individuals who have experienced a difficult upbringing develop schemata of fear as well as anxiety and will react almost immediately when they feel threatened. People who are anxious predominantly focus on any peril-related stimuli since they are hyper vigilant. For example, an anxious individual who is about to cross the street at the same time a car drives to a stop sign. The anxious person will automatically assume the driver will not stop. This is recognition of threat through a semantic process that instantaneously occurs. Ambiguous cues are viewed as a threat since there is no relevant knowledge to make sense of. People will have a difficult time to understand and will respond negatively.  This kind of behavior can explain how implicit cognition may be an influence for pathological anxiety.

The ideas of psychotic patients who have low self-esteem are prone to more serious illnesses. This concept was examined through both implicit and explicit perspectives by measuring the self-esteem of paranoia and depression patients. Previous research suggests that negative implicit cognition is not the symptoms for depression and paranoia, but it is an antecedent for the onset. Current research proposes that high implicit self-esteem is linked to less paranoia.{{sfn|Valiente et al.|2011}} It is imperative for patients who have low self-esteem to become more overt about these situations. Another study found a substantial association between adverse self-questioning in implicit cognition and depression.  People who do not think highly of themselves are more likely to be depressed because of this involuntary implicit learning.

Implicit cognition is another influential predictor for bipolar disorder and unipolar disorder. Research proposes patients with bipolar disorder show more common implicit and depressive self-referencing than unipolar patients. Implicit cognition plays a strong role for patients with both bipolar and unipolar disorder. These patients have dysfunctional self-schemata, which is viewed as vulnerability for potential illnesses. Patients who have this vulnerability usually do not seek mental assistance which can later become more problematic to treat. Bipolar disorder patients with low implicit self-esteem are more defensive. This is an unconscious reaction to be manic protective when they feel threatened in any way.
Since the growing research of implicit cognition is associated with abnormalities, researchers attempted to find a connection between implicit neuroticism and schizophrenia. Indeed, there was a correlation; participants with schizophrenia were high in implicit neuroticism and low in implicit extraversion when compared to people who were mentally healthy. Participants were given questionnaires that ask personality questions such as "I enjoy being the center of attention". Implicit cognition constitutes low levels of extraversion because these participants are known to avoid any coping. Schizophrenia patients and healthy individuals differ in associative representation pertaining to themselves in neuroticism features.  People who are schizophrenic develop an implicit learning, meaning they have an error free learning style so they never take feedback from anyone else.

Research on suicide can be a difficult process because suicidal patients are commonly covert about their intentions to avoid hospitalization. An implicit cognition associated self-task was applied in one experiment to unveil any suspicious behavior of people who might attempt suicide. This study found patients who were released from mental hospitals showed significant implicit association to attempt suicide. The Implicit Association Task would predict whether a patient was likely to attempt suicide depending on they respond. An individual's implicit cognition may lead to a behavior to best cope with stress. This behavior may be suicide, substance abuse, or even violence. However, implicit association with death will show those most at risk for attempting suicide because this individual is looking for the best solution for ending their stress.

==Task performed==
Implicit cognition is measured in different ways to find the most accurate outcomes. The task used for patients with anxiety disorders was a modified Stroop task to observe attention biases in anxiety. A participant's reaction time was measured by the reported color of each word. Participants would name the color for each risk relevant words and risk irrelevant words and depending on the color of each word might slow the reaction time. Colors like red were used to see if anxious participants would have a slower reaction time. These colors are known as aposematic implying a threat warning. Most studies used the Implicit Association Test which varies for each study. For example, implicit self-esteem can be tested by giving participants questionnaires that are self-referent.  These ask questions like "I am known to be suicidal".  Depending on the response of the participants, the researcher can assessed the current state for each participant. Patients that were rated high in suicide immediately received psychiatric treatment. According to these experiments implicit cognition may be a strong predictor for mental disorders.

'''''Inventing Iron Man: The Possibility of a Human Machine''''' is a popular science [[book]] published in 2011 by neuroscience professor, martial arts master, and long-time comic-book reader [[E. Paul Zehr]]. By looking at current technology, as well as how the human body and nervous system would have to adapt, Zehr applies scientific principles and creativity to explore the feasibility of Iron Man as a reality.  

==Synopsis==
In the book, Zehr physically deconstructs Iron Man, analyzing how we could use modern-day technology to create a suit of armor similar to the one made by Tony Stark. The book makes a direct, parallel comparison of comic book science fiction with modern science. Zehr expresses that while science may be nearing a point where a suit like Iron Man’s could be made, it is important to consider limitations of the human body itself. '''''Inventing Iron Man''''' scientifically examines the brain-machine interface, bringing together concepts in neuroscience and neuroplasticity.

'''John Talbot Robinson''' (10 January 1923 – 12 October 2001) was a distinguished [[South Africa]]n [[hominin]] [[paleontologist]].  His most famous discovery (with [[Robert Broom]]) was the nearly complete fossil skull of the hominin species ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'', known as [[Mrs. Ples]].

Robinson was born in [[Elliot, South Africa]]. After training in [[Cape Town]] as a [[zoology|zoologist]], Robinson moved to [[Pretoria]] in 1946 to take up a post at the [[Transvaal Museum]]. In Pretoria, he worked with [[Robert Broom]]. They focused on excavations at the caves of [[Sterkfontein]], [[Kromdraai]] and [[Swartkrans]]. Between 1946 and 1952 they jointly published twenty-three books and articles.

After Broom's death in 1951, Robinson took over as head of the Department of [[Vertebrate Paleontology]] and [[Physical Anthropology]]. In 1956 he published what is arguably his most important work, a monograph titled ''The Dentition of the Australopithecinae'' after which the [[University of Cape Town]] awarded him a [[Doctor of Science]] degree.

In 1963 Robinson began a Professorship at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] and eventually held joint appointments in the Zoology and Anthropology Departments. He was a gifted and empathetic teacher who spent many after-class hours mentoring his undergraduate and graduate students.  He taught courses in [[evolutionary theory]] and [[human evolution|human origins]], [[zoology]] and [[anthropology]]. Robinson continued to make trips back to South Africa to carry out research.

He died in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] in 2001.

Dr. '''Joseph Tracy Gregory''' (July 28, 1914 – November 18, 2007) was an American [[paleontology|paleontologist]] and [[professor]].&lt;ref name="SFC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UCMP" /&gt;

Joseph Tracy Gregory was born in [[Eureka, California]], the only child of Frank Gregory, a civil engineer, and Edith Tracy, a high school teacher.  He grew up in [[Berkeley, California]] and continued with his college education there, graduating from the University of California with an A.B. in 1935, and receiving his doctorate in 1938.  During [[World War II]], he served as a lieutenant in the Army Air Forces in the weather service.

==Paleontology==
After the war, he became Assistant Professor of [[Geology]] at [[Yale University]], as well as Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology at the [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]].  In 1960, he moved to the [[University of California at Berkeley]], where he was Professor of Vertebrate Paleontology, eventually retiring in 1979 as Emeritus Professor.

He was especially active in researching the paleontological record of the Western United States.  In his later career, he gained notice as the primary editor of the annual "Bibliography of Vertebrate Paleontology."

The Society of Vertebrate Paleontology’s [[Joseph T. Gregory Award]] is given annually since 1992 for “contributions to the welfare of Vertebrate Paleontology.”&lt;ref name="SVP" /&gt;

==Family==
He married Jane Everest in 1949.  They had two children, Carl Douglas Gregory (1950- ) and Sarah Jane Gregory (1953-2006).

This '''list of Cambridge University Press journals''' includes all [[academic journals]] published by [[Cambridge Journals]] {{As of|2015|10|7|lc=y|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/browseJournalsAlphabetically}}, including journals no longer published or no longer published by Cambridge, but for which they still maintain archives. Several journals in this list are published by Cambridge in cooperation with or on behalf of other entities such as learned and professional societies. In these cases Cambridge provides publishing and printing, distribution, online archives, and other services on behalf of the original publisher.{{Sfn|About Us|n.d.}}

Cambridge Journals publishes journals under three main access policies: [[closed access]], [[open access]], and a hybrid model in which individual articles in an otherwise closed access journal is available under open access terms. Such articles are designated as open access by its author or publishing organisation at time of acceptance, and Cambridge Journals charges an article processing fee to cover their associated costs like [[peer-review]], [[copy-editing]], and [[typesetting]]. For articles published as open access in hybrid journals, Cambridge Journals applies what it terms its "double-dipping policy": for journals with more than a minimum share of open access articles (5%) and article processing fees (£5000), subscription rates are lowered for renewing subscribers the following year. In 2015, under this policy and using data from 2014, subscription renewal rates for 2016 were reduced for six journals by 2.6–7.7%. Articles published under open access terms may be licensed under one of several available [[Creative Commons]] licenses.{{Efn|{{As of|2015|10|7|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displaySpecialPage?pageId=4604}}, the following licenses are available: CC-BY, CC-BY-NC-SA, CC-BY-NC-ND.}}{{Sfn|Open Access FAQs|n.d.}}

==Non-fiction==
[[Non-fiction]] is an account or representation of a subject which is presented as fact.

A '''rock formation''' is an isolated, scenic, or spectacular surface [[rock (geology)|rock]] [[outcrop]]. Rock formations are usually the result of [[weathering]] and [[erosion]] sculpting the existing rock. The term 'rock [[Geological formation|formation]]' can also refer to specific sedimentary [[stratum|strata]] or other rock unit in [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] and [[petrology|petrologic]] studies.

A rock structure can be created in any rock type or combination:
* [[Igneous rocks]] are created when molten rock cools and solidifies, with or without crystallization. They may be either [[plutonic]] bodies or [[volcanic]] extrusives. Again, erosive forces sculpt their current forms.
* [[Metamorphic rocks]] are created by rocks that have been transformed into another kind of rock, usually by some combination of heat, pressure and chemical alteration.
* [[Sedimentary rock]]s are created by a variety of processes but usually involving deposition, grain by grain, layer by layer, in water or, in the case of terrestrial sediments, on land through the action of wind or sometimes moving ice. [[Erosion]] later exposes them in their current form.

Geologists have created a number of terms to describe different rock structures in the [[landscape]] that can be formed by natural processes:
* [[Butte]] 
* [[cliff|Crag]]
* [[Escarpment]]
* [[Gorge]]
* [[Inselberg]], or monadnock, is a residual relief feature. It can be an isolated hill, a knob, ridge or small mountain that rises abruptly, like an island, from a gently sloping or virtually level surrounding plain. ''Inselberg'' is a German word that means "island mountain". [[Uluru]]/[[Ayers Rock]] in Australia is a noted example.
* [[Mesa]]
* [[pyramidal peak|Peak]]
* [[Promontory]] is a prominent mass of land which overlooks lower lying land or a body of water.
* River cliff
* [[Sea cliff]]
* [[Stack (geology)|Stack]]
* [[Stone run]]
* [[Tor (rock formation)|Tor]]

Each color represents the spatial extent of a distinct genotype in a microscale model using stochastic cellular automata.

'''Microscale models''' form a broad class of [[computational model]]s that simulate fine-scale details, in contrast with '''macroscale models''', which amalgamate details into select categories.&lt;ref name="Gustafsson 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gustafsson 2007"/&gt; Microscale and macroscale models can be used together to understand different aspects of the same problem.

== Applications ==

Macroscale models can include [[ordinary differential equation|ordinary]], [[partial differential equation|partial]], and [[integro-differential equation|integro-differential]] equations, where categories and [[Flow (mathematics)|flows]] between the categories determine the dynamics, or may involve only [[algebraic equation]]s. An abstract macroscale model may be combined with more detailed microscale models. Connections between the two scales are related to [[multiscale modeling]]. One mathematical technique for multiscale modeling of nanomaterials is based upon the use of [[Multiscale Green's function]].

In contrast, microscale models can simulate a variety of details, such as individual bacteria in [[biofilm]]s,&lt;ref name="Dillon 1996"/&gt; individual pedestrians in simulated neighborhoods,&lt;ref name="Bandini 2007"/&gt; individual light beams in [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray-tracing imagery]],&lt;ref name="Gartley 2008"/&gt; individual houses in cities,&lt;ref name="OSullivan 2002"/&gt; fine-scale pores and fluid flow in batteries,&lt;ref name="Less 2012"/&gt; fine-scale compartments in meteorology,&lt;ref name="Knutz 2000"/&gt; fine-scale structures in particulate systems,&lt;ref name="Marchisio 2013"/&gt; and other models where interactions among individuals and background conditions determine the dynamics.

[[discrete event simulation|Discrete-event]] models, [[individual-based model|individual-based]] models, and [[agent-based model|agent-based]] models are special cases of microscale models. However, microscale models do not require discrete individuals or discrete events. Fine details on topography, buildings, and trees can add microscale detail to [[Microscale meteorology|meteorological simulations]] and can connect to what are called mesoscale models in that discipline.&lt;ref name="Knutz 2000"/&gt; Square-meter-sized landscape resolution available from {{Smallcaps|lidar}} images allow waterflow across land surfaces to be modeled, for example rivulets and water pockets, using gigabyte-sized arrays of detail.&lt;ref name="Barnes 2014"/&gt; Models of [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] may include individual neurons but may run in continuous time and thereby lack precise discrete events.&lt;ref name="You 1993"/&gt;

== History ==

Ideas for computational microscale models arose in the earliest days of computing and were applied to complex systems that could not accurately be described by standard mathematical forms.

Two themes emerged in the work of two founders of modern computation around the middle of the 20th century. First, pioneer [[Alan Turing]] used simplified macroscale models to understand the chemical basis of [[the chemical basis of morphogenesis|morphogenesis]], but then proposed and used computational microscale models to understand the nonlinearities and other conditions that would arise in actual biological systems.&lt;ref name="Turing 1952"/&gt; Second, pioneer [[John von Neumann]] created a [[cellular automaton]] to understand the possibilities for self-replication of arbitrarily complex entities,&lt;ref name="Burks 1966"/&gt; which had a microscale representation in the cellular automaton but no simplified macroscale form. This second theme is taken to be part of [[agent based model|agent-based models]], where the entities ultimately can be artificially intelligent agents operating autonomously.

By the last quarter of the 20th century, [[Moore's Law|computational capacity]] had grown so far&lt;ref name="Moore 1965"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berezin 2004"/&gt; that up to tens of thousands of individuals or more could be included in microscale models, and that sparse arrays could be applied to also achieve high performance.&lt;ref name="Brown 1988"/&gt; Continued increases in computing capacity allowed hundreds of millions of individuals to be simulated on ordinary computers with microscale models by the early 21st century.

The term "microscale model" arose later in the 20th century and now appears in the literature of many branches of physical and biological science.&lt;ref name="Bandini 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OSullivan 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Less 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knutz 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frind 1987"/&gt;

== Example ==

Figure&amp;nbsp;1 represents a fundamental macroscale model: [[exponential growth|population growth]] in an unlimited environment. Its equation is relevant elsewhere, such as compounding growth of [[capital (economics)|capital]] in economics or [[exponential decay]] in physics. It has one amalgamated variable, &lt;math&gt;N(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the number of individuals in the population at some time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. It has an amalgamated parameter &lt;math&gt;r=\beta-\delta&lt;/math&gt;, the annual growth rate of the population, calculated as the difference between the annual birth rate &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; and the annual death rate &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. Time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; can measured in years, as shown here for illustration, or in any other suitable unit.

The macroscale model of Figure&amp;nbsp;1 amalgamates parameters and incorporates a number of simplifying approximations: 
#the birth and death rates are constant;
#all individuals are identical, with no genetics or age structure;
#fractions of individuals are meaningful;
#parameters are constant and do not evolve;
#habitat is perfectly uniform;
#no immigration or emigration occurs; and 
#randomness does not enter. 
These approximations of the macroscale model can all be refined in analogous microscale models.

On the first approximation listed above—that birth and death rates are constant—the macroscale model of the Figure&amp;nbsp;1 is exactly the mean of a large number of stochastic trials with the growth rate fluctuating randomly in each instance of time.&lt;ref name="May 1974"/&gt; Microscale stochastic details are subsumed into a partial differential [[diffusion equation]] and that equation is used to establish the equivalence.

To relax other assumptions, researchers have applied computational methods. Figure&amp;nbsp;2 is a sample computational microscale algorithm that corresponds to the macroscale model of Figure&amp;nbsp;1. When all individuals are identical and mutations in birth and death rates are disabled, the microscale dynamics closely parallel the macroscale dynamics (Figures&amp;nbsp;3A and&amp;nbsp;3B). The slight differences between the two models arise from stochastic variations in the microscale version not present in the deterministic macroscale model. These variations will be different each time the algorithm is carried out, arising from intentional variations in random number sequences.

When not all individuals are identical, the microscale dynamics can differ significantly from the macroscale dynamics, simulating more realistic situations than can be modeled at the macroscale (Figures&amp;nbsp;3C and&amp;nbsp;3D). The microscale model does not explicitly incorporate the differential equation, though for large populations it simulates it closely. When individuals differ from one another, the system has a well defined behavior but the differential equations governing that behavior are difficult to codify. The algorithm of Figure&amp;nbsp;2 is a basic example of what is called an [[equation-free modeling|equation-free model]].&lt;ref name="Kevrekidis 2009"/&gt;

When mutations are enabled in the microscale model (&lt;math&gt;\sigma&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;), the population grows more rapidly than in the macroscale model (Figures&amp;nbsp;3C and&amp;nbsp;3D). Mutations in parameters allow some individuals to have higher birth rates and others to have lower death rates, and those individuals contribute proportionally more to the population. All else being equal, the average birth rate drifts to higher values and the average death rate drifts to lower values as the simulation progresses. This drift is tracked in the data structures named ''beta'' and ''delta'' of the microscale algorithm of Figure&amp;nbsp;2.

The algorithm of Figure&amp;nbsp;2 is a simplified a microscale model using the [[Euler method]]. Other algorithms such as the Gillespie method&lt;ref name="Gillespie 1977"/&gt; and the [[discrete event simulation|discrete event method]]&lt;ref name="Brown 1988"/&gt; are also used in practice. Versions of the algorithm in practical use include efficiencies such as removing individuals from consideration once they die (to reduce memory requirements and increase speed), and scheduling stochastic events into the future (to provide a continuous time scale and to further improve speed).&lt;ref name="Brown 1988"/&gt; Such approaches can be orders of magnitude faster.

== Complexity ==

The complexity of systems addressed by microscale models leads to complexity in the models themselves, and the specification of a microscale model can be tens or hundreds of times larger than its corresponding macroscale model. (The simplified example of Figure&amp;nbsp;2 has 25 times as many lines in its specification as does Figure&amp;nbsp;1.) Since bugs occur in computer software and cannot completely be removed by standard methods such as testing,&lt;ref name="Dijkstra 1970"/&gt; and since complex models often are neither published in detail nor peer-reviewed, their validity has been called into question.&lt;ref name="Saltelli 2014"/&gt; Guidelines on best practices for microscale models exist&lt;ref name="Baxter 2006"/&gt; but no papers on the topic claim a full resolution of the problem of validating complex models.

== Future ==

Computing capacity is reaching levels where populations of entire countries or even the entire world are within the reach of microscale models, and improvements in census and travel data allow further improvements in parameterizing such models. Remote sensors from [[earth observation satellite|Earth-observing satellites]] and from ground-based observatories such as the [[National Ecological Observatory Network]] (NEON) provide large amounts of data for calibration. Potential applications range from predicting and reducing the spread of disease to helping understand the dynamics of the earth.

'''Figure&amp;nbsp;1.''' ''One of the simplest of macroscale models: an [[ordinary differential equation]] describing continuous [[exponential growth]]. &lt;math&gt;N(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the population at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;dN(t)/dt&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of change through time in the single dimension &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;N(0)&lt;/math&gt; is the initial population at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a birth rate per time unit, and &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is a death rate per time unit. At the left is the differential form; at the right is the explicit solution in terms of standard mathematical functions, which follows in this case from the differential form. Almost all macroscale models are more complex than this example, in that they have multiple dimensions, lack explicit solutions in terms of standard mathematical functions, and must be understood from their differential forms.''

'''Figure&amp;nbsp;2.''' ''A basic algorithm applying the [[Euler method]] to an individual-based model. See text for discussion. The algorithm,  represented in [[pseudocode]], begins with invocation of procedure &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Microscale}()&lt;/math&gt;, which uses the data structures to carry out the simulation according to the numbered steps described at the right. It repeatedly invokes function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Mutation}(v)&lt;/math&gt;, which returns its parameter perturbed by a random number drawn from a uniform distribution with standard deviation defined by the variable &lt;math&gt;sigma&lt;/math&gt;. (The square root of 12 appears because the [[standard deviation]] of a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]] includes that factor.) Function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Rand}()&lt;/math&gt; in the algorithm is assumed to return a uniformly distributed random number &lt;math&gt;0\le Rand()&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;. The data are assumed to be reset to their initial values on each invocation of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Microscale}()&lt;/math&gt;.''

==History==
Monstertalk was founded by [[Benjamin Radford]], Blake Smith and [[Karen Stollznow]].  The first episode was released on July 2, 2009, and featured an interview with [[NYU]] Professor Todd Disotell about the attempted use of DNA evidence in cryptozoologists' search for Bigfoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skeptic.com/podcasts/monstertalk/09/07/02/ |title=Bigfoot DNA|work=MonsterTalk|publisher=Skeptic Magazine|date=July 2, 2009|accessdate=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MonsterTalk interviews scientists and investigators that research cryptozoological claims.

An '''occult fracture''' is a fracture that is not readily visible, generally in regard to [[projectional radiography]] ("X-ray"). Radiographically occult and subtle fractures are a diagnostic challenge. They may be divided into (1) "high energy trauma fracture," (2) "fatigue fracture" from cyclical and sustained mechanical stress, and (3) "insufficiency fracture" occurring in weakened bone (e.g., in osteoporosis and postradiotherapy). Independently of the cause, the initial radiographic examination can be negative either because the findings seem normal or are too subtle. Advanced imaging tools such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and scintigraphy are highly valuable in the early detection of these fractures.&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jarraya|first1=Mohamed|last2=Hayashi|first2=Daichi|last3=Roemer|first3=Frank W.|last4=Crema|first4=Michel D.|last5=Diaz|first5=Luis|last6=Conlin|first6=Jane|last7=Marra|first7=Monica D.|last8=Jomaah|first8=Nabil|last9=Guermazi|first9=Ali|title=Radiographically Occult and Subtle Fractures: A Pictorial Review|journal=Radiology Research and Practice|volume=2013|year=2013|pages=1–10|issn=2090-1941|doi=10.1155/2013/370169}} [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ CC-BY 3.0]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fractures represent up to 80% of the missed diagnoses in the emergency department. Failure to recognize the subtle signs of osseous injury is one of the reasons behind this major diagnostic challenge. While occult fractures present no radiographic findings, radiographically subtle fractures are easily overlooked on initial radiographs. In both cases, a negative radiographic diagnosis with prominent clinical suspicion of osseous injury will prompt advanced imaging examination such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and nuclear medicine to confirm or exclude the clinically suspected diagnosis. The burden entailed in missing these fractures includes prolonged pain with a loss of function, and disability. Early detection, on the other hand, enables more effective treatment, a shorter hospitalization period if necessary, and decreased medical costs in the long run. It will also prevent inherent complications such as nonunion, malunion, premature osteoarthritis, and avascular osteonecrosis (as in scaphoid fracture). Occult and subtle fractures may be divided into: (1) fractures associated with high energy trauma; fatigue fracture secondary to repetitive and unusual stress being applied to bone with normal elastic resistance; and insufficiency fracture resulting from normal or minimal stress on a bone with decreased elastic resistance. The term "stress fracture" is more general and encompasses both of the latter two entities.&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"/&gt;

Radiographically occult and subtle fractures are often a challenging diagnostic problem in daily clinical practice. Radiologists should be aware of the different situations and mechanisms of these injuries as well as the subtle radiographic signs that can be encountered in each situation. The knowledge of normal images and the consideration of the clinical context are of great value in improving the detection of these fractures either on conventional radiographs or with more advanced imaging tools.&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"/&gt;

==Imaging tools==
Thanks to rapid technological advancement, new and more efficient imaging hardware is constantly released for all imaging modalities including CT, MRI, nuclear medicine, and ultrasound. Nonetheless, not every department can afford all new technologies, and radiologists sometimes have to face the challenge of providing the highest diagnostic performance with basic imaging tools. This can only be achieved by ensuring high quality of examination with the available imaging tools.&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"/&gt;

===Projectional radiography===
Radiography is the first step for detection of fractures. The detection of subtle signs of fracture requires a high standard for the acquisition technique and a thorough and systematic interpretation of radiographic images. Correct diagnosis primarily relies on the reader's experience. Awareness of normal anatomic features is crucial for the interpreter to be able to detect subtle signs of fracture. Fat pads should be carefully examined for convexity, which implies joint effusion (e.g., in the hip and elbow joints). However, the radiographic technique (positioning in particular) must be optimal for this evaluation to be valid. Osseous lines should be checked for integrity (e.g., acetabular rim in the hip). Trabecular angulation, impaction lines, and sclerotic bands also suggest fracture in osseous structures with a significant proportion of cancellous bone such as proximal femur.&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"/&gt;

The general rule is to perform two orthogonal views, but more specific views should be added if there is any suspicion of fracture. Moreover, one should be aware of the commonly encountered lesions and their locations. In wrist trauma, for instance, the interpreter should pay close attention to the scaphoid and triquetrum, which are the two most commonly injured carpal bones. The mechanism of trauma may also be helpful to locate the potential fracture. A fall on an outstretched hand suggests scaphoid fracture. Although the classical presentation consists of a radiolucent line and cortical disruption, the radiographic signs will depend upon the time elapsed between the first clinical symptoms and the time of radiographic examination, the location of the fracture within the bone, and the ratio of cortical to cancellous bone. Particular attention should be paid when analysing the subchondral plate, which may be disrupted or deformed. In metaphyseal areas, delayed signs of fracture include a band of sclerosis perpendicular to the trabeculae, while diaphyseal fractures may present as periosteal thickening.&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"/&gt;

Digital radiography known as tomosynthesis has been shown to be superior to conventional radiographs in the detection of occult fracture of the scaphoid. Tomosynthesis has the ability to demonstrate cortical, as well as moderately displaced trabecular fractures. Thus, the performance of tomosynthesis in detecting radiographically occult fractures is considered as comparable to CT.&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"/&gt;

===Computed Tomography===
Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is a highly valuable imaging tool for the diagnosis of occult fractures. CT has several advantages including short acquisition time (compared to MRI), the ability to acquire volumetric and isotropic image data sets, the opportunity to reconstruct multiplanar reformations in any arbitrary plane, and excellent spatial resolution. Moreover, the image quality for multiplanar reconstruction may be increased by reducing slice thickness and acquisition pitch. In general, bony structures are best demonstrated by using a small focal spot and using a "bone" algorithm. CT contributes much to the diagnosis of occult fractures by depicting subtle fracture lines, depressed, or distracted articular surfaces and by assessing bone loss It also detects late bony changes such as increased medullary density, endosteal sclerosis, sclerotic lines in trabecular bone, and periosteal thickening. Moreover, CT aids in excluding other differential diagnoses, especially in case of isolated bone marrow edema, by confirming the normal appearance of the remaining trabeculae and excluding space-occupying lesions such as malignancy and osteomyelitis.&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"/&gt;

Newest generation of CT, such as dedicated cone-beam CT (CBCT) system for musculoskeletal extremities, may be beneficial in various conditions, such as arthritis and occult fractures. Although dedicated CBCT for musculoskeletal extremities is still a matter of research, it has been shown to be of potential benefit as an adjunct for CT and MRI. It offers the possibility of volumetric imaging, which may be helpful in case of suspected occult fractures. It also provides higher spatial resolution and a potentially reduced dose compared to CT.&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"/&gt;

===Magnetic resonance imaging===
The diagnostic performance of MRI in the detection of occult fractures has been shown to be comparable, or better than MDCT. Indeed, while the specificity of both CT and MRI for the diagnosis of fracture can be as high as 100%, the sensitivity was reported to be higher for MRI. The superiority of MRI over any other imaging modality including MDCT for the detection of occult hip fractures is now recognised. For instance, an occult intertrochanteric extension of a greater trochanter fracture can be most effectively appreciated on MRI Moreover, MRI is extremely helpful in detecting associated soft tissue abnormalities, especially ligamentous lesions. MRI is now considered as the standard in this context. However, because of its relative unavailability in emergency settings and high costs, MRI may only be performed in "high risk patients" with negative X-rays. For example, when a hip occult fracture is suspected, patients with reduced baseline mobility and pain on axial compression are considered at risk and, therefore, should be examined by MRI. MRI signs of occult fractures are evident several weeks before radiographic signs appear. In the hip, a limited and cost effective MR protocol, with only T1 weighted () coronal images, may enable a reliable diagnosis or exclusion of occult fracture in very little time, for example, 7 minutes. Typically, a linear hypointensity is observed on T1 W images. MRI is also highly sensitive to marrow abnormalities surrounding the fracture line, which appear as hypointensity on T1 W images and hyperintensity on fluid-sensitive sequences. Such signal changes are thought to be a combination of bone marrow edema, intraosseous haemorrhage, and/or granulation tissue and help to identify even undisplaced fractures. However, in the absence of a history of trauma and linear hypointensities on T1 W images, isolated bone marrow edema may represent other pathologies such as osteoid osteoma and sclerosing osteomyelitis.&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"/&gt;

Although 1.5 T and 3 T MR is considered as the current gold standard for the detection of radiographically occult fractures, ultra-high field MR provide higher signal-to-noise ratio and, therefore, is expected to be superior to 1.5 T and 3 T. Ultra-high field MR seems to be promising in the diagnosis of a variety of musculoskeletal conditions including trauma, but it is not used in daily routine yet.&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"/&gt;

===Nuclear medicine===
The most traditional method is bone scintigraphy. Although scintigraphy is highly sensitive for the detection of occult fracture, its lack of specificity limits its diagnostic utility. However, when MRI is not available, scintigraphy may be of value, especially in the absence of trauma history, for example, for detection of insufficiency and fatigue fractures. While radiography may show only late signs of bone reaction (such as periosteal thickening and band of sclerosis), scintigraphic examination allows for earlier detection of bony changes. Regarding Fluorine-18 2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), it is critical to be aware that occult fractures may be responsible of marked metabolic uptake, and, thus, represent a potential false positive of metastatic disease. Integrated hybrid single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT)/CT combines the detection of abnormal bone metabolism with SPECT, to the precise anatomical detail provided by high resolution CT. For instance, SPECT/CT may be interesting in the detection of radiographic occult fractures of the wrist and other sport-related injuries.&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"/&gt;

===Ultrasonography===
High frequency ultrasound has been shown to be of value, particularly in the pediatric population. In this case, and in an emergency setting, ultrasonography can be more accessible and less time consuming than radiographs and has high specificity and sensitivity in the evaluation of suspected long bone fractures. The utility of ultrasonography has also been shown for adults with suspicion of wrist trauma or fatigue/stress fracture. Recently, it has been suggested that therapeutic ultrasound may be beneficial as a primary evaluation of bone stress injury; however, its benefit seems to be more evident in selected high risk patients rather than general population.&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"/&gt;

==High energy trauma fractures==
Occult osseous injuries may result from a direct blow to the bone by compressive forces of adjacent bones against one another or by traction forces during an avulsion injury. Lesions in the tibial plateau, hip, ankle, and wrist are often missed. In a tibial plateau fracture, any disruption of the posterior and anterior cortical rims of the plateau should be sought. Impaction of subchondral bone will appear as an increased sclerosis of the subchondral bone (Figure 1). In the hip, posterior acetabular fractures also present subtle radiographic findings. The acetabular lines should then be carefully examined keeping in mind that the posterior rim, which is harder to see on X-rays, is more frequently fractured than the anterior rim (Figure 2). In the wrist, detection of carpal bone fractures is often challenging, with up to 18% of scaphoid fractures radiographically occult. Carpal fractures, especially the scaphoid, are associated with the risk of avascular necrosis. In apparently normal wrist radiographs from symptomatic patients, if there is history of a fall on an outstretched hand with pain in the anatomic snuffbox, suggesting scaphoid injury, the initial examination with posteroanterior, lateral, and pronation oblique views must be complemented by other specific views such as supination oblique and the "scaphoid" view A careful examination of cortices for evidence of discontinuity or offset and cancellous bone for lucency is necessary (Figure 3).&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"/&gt;

Triquetral fracture usually occurs on the dorsal aspect by impingement from the ulnar styloid or avulsion of strong ligamentous attachment. The dorsal avulsion fracture or "chip fracture" appears as a small bony fragment on the dorsal aspect of the triquetrum and is best detected on the lateral view(Figure 4). When radiography is negative in patients with high suspicion of a fracture, both MRI and MDCT will be of value. However, it has been shown that MRI is superior for detecting trabecular fractures in carpal bones.

(b) Lateral radiograph of the same wrist demonstrates a chip fracture off the dorsal aspect of the triquetrum (arrow).&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"/&gt;

The greater tuberosity of the humerus is also an illustrative location of occult fractures. The osseous injury may follow seizures, glenohumeral dislocation, forced abduction, or direct impaction. They are commonly discovered on MRI in symptomatic patients with suspicion of rotator cuff tear. Coronal images are best suited for detection. They appear as crescentic oblique lines surrounded by a bone marrow edema pattern (Figure 5). The rotator cuff must be inspected since associated ligamentous lesions are common. In the ankle, malleoli and tarsal bones should be checked carefully for any cortical disruptions and radiolucent lines that may reveal a fracture. Awareness of the exact location of the pain will help direct the attention of the interpreter when searching for very subtle signs of fracture (Figure 6).&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"/&gt;

Avulsion fractures, which consist of a detached bone fragment resulting from a ligament or tendon pulling away from the bone, may also present with subtle radiographic signs. Tiny osseous fragments near the presumed attachment site of a ligament suggest this diagnosis. Common sites are the lateral tibial plateau (the Segond fracture), the spinal tuberosity of the tibia resulting from anterior cruciate ligament avulsion, and the ischial tuberosity.&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"/&gt;

==Fatigue fractures==
Fatigue fractures occur when healthy bone is exposed to repeated stress. The bone is a living tissue, with the capacity to repair itself; fatigue fractures occur when repetitive injuries exceed the repair capacity of the bone. This type of fracture does not occur as a single event but rather incrementally as a sequence of cellular events that begin with increased osteoclastic activity. Microfractures occur later and are accompanied by bone marrow edema, which can be detected on MRI. This stage appears on MRI as an isolated bone marrow edema pattern without a fracture line and is called stress reaction. Then, periosteal new bone forms and may be visible on radiography. Full cortical fractures occur if the repetitive stress continues. Only timely detection and appropriate management can interrupt this sequence.&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"/&gt;

Fatigue fractures are more frequent in women which may be due to the relatively smaller bones of women. Moreover, pregnancy is a well-recognized risk factor for femoral neck fatigue fracture. While fibular and metatarsal fractures have a low risk of complications, other sites including the femoral neck, midanterior tibia, navicular, talar, and other intraarticular fractures are prone to complications such as delayed union, nonunion, and displacement. The site of the insufficiency fracture may be specific to the activity: for example, rugby and basketball players are more prone to navicular fractures, while gymnasts have a higher risk for talar fractures (Figure 7). Long distance runners are at increased risk for pelvic, tibial (Figures 8 and 9), and fibular fractures. In the military, calcaneus (Figure 10) and metatarsals are the most commonly cited injuries, especially in new recruits. Billiard players are at risk for upper limb fractures (Figure 11).&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"/&gt;

Radiographic examination usually shows delayed signs of fracture up to 2 to 3 months after initial injury. In a bony region with a high proportion of cancellous bone (e.g., femoral neck), a fatigue fracture appears as an ill-defined transverse sclerotic band (in contact or close to the medial cortex), with a periosteal thickening appearing at a later stage. In case of continued stress, a fracture line through the thickened cortex and a region of sclerosis may be observed. MRI is of great value for early diagnosis and displaying bone marrow edema, while scintigraphy is useful for showing increased metabolic activity within the bone. However, MRI is preferred since scintigraphy lacks specificity. In case of isolated bone marrow edema in MRI without a fracture line, the diagnosis of fatigue fracture may be more complicated, and other conditions such as transient edema and osteoid osteoma need to be excluded. Additional imaging by CT is warranted in such cases.&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"/&gt;

==Insufficiency fractures==
Insufficiency fractures occur in weakened bones. Although osteoporosis is a classic cause, other conditions resulting in bone demineralization are well-recognized risk factors. These include previous radiation therapy and chemotherapy, especially in a context of gynaecologic malignancy, chronic renal failure, chronic rheumatological diseases, and corticosteroid therapy. In long bones, chronic joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis are associated with angular deformity and flexion contraction, increasing the stress on the bone around the joints and, therefore, the risk of insufficiency fracture. Pelvic, sacral, and proximal femoral fractures are of increasing significance especially with the aging of the population.&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"/&gt;

[[File:Inversion recovery MRI of right sacral alar insufficiency fracture.jpg|thumb|Figure 12: Right sacral alar insufficiency fracture in a 29-year-old woman with a 9-year history of corticosteroid therapy for systemic lupus erythematous. Conventional radiographs showed normal appearance (not shown). Coronal inversion recovery MRI shows an area of hyperintensity in the right sacral ala (white arrows), centered on a linear hypointensity corresponding to the fracture line (black arrowhead).&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"/&gt;]]
The sacrum is usually masked by overlapping bowel gas in conventional radiographs, and the subtle radiographic findings are usually nondiagnostic and even misleading. The characteristic "H" pattern has been correlated with biomechanical models of patient activities. The vertical parasagittal planes correspond to the region of maximal stress during walking, while the horizontal fracture develops later, secondary to the loss of lateral support by parasagittal fractures. MRI is the primary imaging technique in this case, with the most common MRI pattern showing bone marrow edema and a fracture line (Figure 12). Coronal views are quite contributive in sacral fractures, allowing the detection of the horizontal component, especially with fluid-sensitive sequences. Although the sacrum is the most commonly involved, pelvic insufficiency fractures are often multiple, and other typical locations should be mentioned.&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"/&gt;

Proximal femoral fractures usually occur in osteoporotic patients, and their signs include subtle neck angulation, trabecular angulation, and subcapital impaction line. A frog-leg lateral view may be helpful if the greater trochanter is short enough. However, positioning can be difficult because of hip pain. In patients with strong suspicion of proximal femoral fracture and negative radiographs, MRI limited to coronal T1 W images and scintigraphy can be highly valuable (Figures 13 and 14). Such an option, with limited examination time, is cost-effective and allows reliable exclusion or confirmation of the diagnosis, preventing an unnecessary stay at the hospital or delayed treatment. Moreover, MRI helps to detect soft tissue abnormalities which are more frequently seen in femoral, acetabular, and pubic injuries than sacral lesions. Concomitant fractures are also frequently seen in typical pelvic sites.&lt;ref name="JarrayaHayashi2013"/&gt;

An '''optical spectrometer''' ('''spectrophotometer''', '''spectrograph''' or '''spectroscope''') is an instrument used to measure properties of [[light]] over a specific portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], typically used in [[spectroscopic analysis]] to identify materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=L. R. P. |last=Butler |first2=K. |last2=Laqua |year=1995 |title=Nomenclature, symbols, units and their usage in spectrochemical analysis-IX. Instrumentation for the spectral dispersion and isolation of optical radiation (IUPAC Recommendations 1995) |journal=Pure Appl. Chem. |volume=67 |issue=10 |series= |pages=1725–1744 |publisher=[[IUPAC]] |doi=10.1351/pac199567101725 |accessdate= |url=http://iupac.org/publications/pac/67/10/1725/ |quote=A spectrometer is the general term for describing a combination of spectral apparatus with one or more detectors to measure the intensity of one or more spectral bands.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variable measured is most often the light's [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]] but could also, for instance, be the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] state. The independent variable is usually the [[wavelength]] of the light or a unit directly proportional to the [[photon]] energy, such as [[Wavenumber|reciprocal centimeters]] or [[electron volt]]s, which has a reciprocal relationship to wavelength.

A [[spectrometer]] is used in [[spectroscopy]] for producing [[spectral line]]s and measuring their [[wavelength]]s and intensities. Spectrometers may also operate over a wide range of non-optical wavelengths, from [[gamma ray]]s and [[X-ray]]s into the [[far infrared]]. If the instrument is designed to measure the spectrum in [[absolute units]] rather than [[relative units]], then it is typically called a [[spectrophotometer]]. The majority of spectrophotometers are used in spectral regions near the visible spectrum.

In general, any particular instrument will operate over a small portion of this total range because of the different techniques used to measure different portions of the spectrum. Below optical frequencies (that is, at [[microwave]] and [[radio]] frequencies), the [[spectrum analyzer]] is a closely related electronic device.

Spectrometers are used in many fields. For example, they are used in astronomy to analyze the radiation from astronomical objects and deduce chemical composition. The spectrometer uses a prism or a grating to spread the light from a distant object into a spectrum. This allows astronomers to detect many of the chemical elements by their characteristic spectral fingerprints. If the object is glowing by itself, it will show spectral lines caused by the glowing gas itself. These lines are named for the elements which cause them, such as the hydrogen alpha, beta, and gamma lines. Chemical compounds may also be identified by absorption. Typically these are dark bands in specific locations in the spectrum caused by energy being absorbed as light from other objects passes through a gas cloud. Much of our knowledge of the chemical makeup of the universe comes from spectra.

Spectroscopes are often used in [[astronomy]] and some branches of [[chemistry]]. Early spectroscopes were simply [[Triangular prism (optics)|prisms]] with graduations marking wavelengths of light. Modern spectroscopes generally use a [[diffraction grating]], a movable [[Diffraction#Single-slit diffraction|slit]], and some kind of [[photodetector]], all automated and controlled by a [[computer]].

[[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] developed the first modern spectroscope by combining a prism, diffraction slit and [[refracting telescope|telescope]] in a manner that increased the spectral resolution and was reproducible in other laboratories. Fraunhofer also went on to invent the first diffraction spectroscope.&lt;ref name="Brand 37"&gt;{{cite book |title=Lines of Light: The Sources of Dispersive Spectroscopy, 1800 - 1930 |last=Brand |first=John C. D. |publisher=Gordon and Breach Publishers |year=1995 |isbn=2884491627 |pages=37–42 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustav Robert Kirchhoff]] and [[Robert Bunsen]] discovered the application of spectroscopes to chemical analysis and used this approach to discover [[caesium]] and [[rubidium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The discovery of the elements. XIII.

When a material is heated to [[incandescence]] it emits [[light]] that is characteristic of the atomic makeup of the material.
Particular light frequencies give rise to sharply defined bands on the scale which can be thought of as fingerprints. For example, the element [[sodium]] has a very characteristic double yellow band known as the Sodium D-lines at 588.9950 and 589.5924 nanometers, the color of which will be familiar to anyone who has seen a low pressure [[sodium vapor lamp]].

In the original spectroscope design in the early 19th century, light entered a slit and a [[collimating lens]] transformed the light into a thin beam of parallel rays. The light then passed through a prism (in hand-held spectroscopes, usually an [[Amici prism]]) that [[refraction|refracted]] the beam into a spectrum because different wavelengths were refracted different amounts due to [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]]. This image was then viewed through a tube with a scale that was transposed upon the spectral image, enabling its direct measurement.

With the development of [[photographic film]], the more accurate [[#Spectrographs|spectrograph]] was created. It was based on the same principle as the spectroscope, but it had a camera in place of the viewing tube. In recent years, the electronic circuits built around the [[photomultiplier]] tube have replaced the camera, allowing real-time spectrographic analysis with far greater accuracy. Arrays of photosensors are also used in place of film in spectrographic systems. Such spectral analysis, or spectroscopy, has become an important scientific tool for analyzing the composition of unknown material and for studying astronomical phenomena and testing astronomical theories.

In modern spectrographs in the UV, visible, and near-IR spectral ranges, the spectrum is generally given in the form of photon number per unit wavelength (nm or μm), wavenumber (μm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), frequency (THz), or energy (eV), with the units indicated by the [[abscissa]]. In the mid- to far-IR, spectra are typically expressed in units of Watts per unit wavelength (μm) or wavenumber (cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). In many cases, the spectrum is displayed with the units left implied (such as "digital counts" per spectral channel).

A spectrograph is an instrument that separates an incoming wave into a [[frequency spectrum]]. There are several kinds of machines referred to as ''spectrographs'', depending on the precise nature of the waves. The first spectrographs used [[photographic paper]] as the detector. The star [[stellar classification|spectral classification]] and discovery of the [[main sequence]], [[Hubble's law]] and the [[Hubble sequence]] were all made with spectrographs that used photographic paper. The plant pigment [[phytochrome]] was discovered using a spectrograph that used living plants as the detector. More recent spectrographs use electronic detectors, such as [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]s which can be used for both visible and [[ultraviolet|UV]] light. The exact choice of detector depends on the wavelengths of light to be recorded.

A spectrograph is sometimes called [[polychromator]], as an analogy to [[monochromator]].

The '''"parallel state"''' is a term coined by American historian [[Robert Paxton]] to describe a collection of organizations or institutions that are state-like in their organization, management and structure, but they are not officially part of the legitimate state or government. They serve primarily to promote the prevailing political and social ideology of the state.

The parallel state differs from the more commonly used "[[state within a state]]" in that they are usually endorsed by the prevailing political elite of a country, while the "state within a state" is a [[pejorative]] term to describe state-like institutions that operate without the consent of and even to the detriment to the authority of an established state (such as churches and religious institutions or [[Secret society|secret societies]] with their own laws and court systems). 

However, [[Turkey (country)|Turkey's]] former Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] has used the term "parallel state" (or "parallel structure") to describe followers of [[Fethullah Gülen]] who occupy senior bureaucratic and judicial positions, which have been accused of attempting to bring down Erdoğan's government. This is in contrast to the meaning of the term initially coined by Paxton, and instead resembles the term "state within a state." Gülen's [[Gülen movement|Cemaat movement]], which has a large presence within Turkey, has allegedly been involved in limiting the power of the [[Turkish Armed Forces]] through the [[Ergenekon trials]] and the [[Sledgehammer (coup plan)|Sledgehammer case]] while allied with Erdoğan. Following the [[2013–14 protests in Turkey|2013–14 protests against Erdoğan's government]], the Cemaat Movement turned against Erdoğan, who thus labelled them as a "parallel state." Erdoğan has blamed Gülen's followers on orchestrating the [[2013 corruption scandal in Turkey|2013 government corruption scandal]], as well as the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt|2016 coup attempt]].

Parallel states are common in [[totalitarian]] societies, such as [[Nazi Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]], the [[Soviet Union]], and [[North Korea]] and are [[Political party|parties]], [[youth organization]]s, leisure organizations, work/labor collectives, [[Labor union|unions]], and [[militia]]s.

"Parallel States" is also a study into the possibility of uniting one country while giving them two states parallel to each other in power and representation, both those states would be compliant however to one  central-authority. This study was also suggested as a corner stone for possible peace scenarios in war torn countries.

[[File:First Six Women Astronauts with Rescue Ball - GPN-2002-000207.jpg|thumb|200px|right|NASA's first women astronauts pose with the prototype personal rescue enclosure (rescue ball)]]The '''personal rescue enclosure''' (PRE) or "rescue ball" was a device for transporting astronauts from one [[Space Shuttle]] to another in case of an emergency. It was produced as a prototype but never flew on any missions.

The ball was 36 inches (86&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter and had a volume of 0.33 cubic meters. The structure comprised three fabric layers and incorporated a window and a zipper to allow the astronaut to enter and exit the ball. The ball enabled one crew member to curl up inside and don an oxygen mask and hold a carbon dioxide scrubber/oxygen supply device with one hour worth of oxygen. The ball would have been connected by an umbilical to the shuttle to supply air until the airlock depressurized. The rescue ball containing the crew member would have been carried to the rescue shuttle by a space suited [[astronaut]].

The PRE was designed to protect humans in space in the event of an emergency where not enough full space suits were available.&lt;ref name=astro&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/r/rescueball.html|publisher=astronautix.com|title=Rescue Ball|accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed in the 1970s and 1980s to support the [[Space Shuttle program]].&lt;ref name=astro /&gt; The PRE was designed to be used in conjunction with a fully suited astronaut that would provide mobility to the person in the ball.&lt;ref name=astro /&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Popular Mechanics|publisher=Hearst Magazines|issn=0032-4558|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=auMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA67|page=67|accessdate=2017-02-23|date=October 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ball's life-support systems consisting of oxygen and a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; scrubber could support a person for about an hour.&lt;ref name=astro /&gt;

{{About|the classification of organisms|the study of speech sounds|Phonetics}}

In [[biology]], '''phenetics''' ({{lang-el|phainein}} - to appear) {{IPAc-en|f|ᵻ|ˈ|n|ɛ|t|ɪ|k|s}}, also known as '''taximetrics''', is an attempt to classify organisms based on overall similarity, usually in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] or other observable traits, regardless of their [[phylogeny]] or evolutionary relation. It is closely related to [[numerical taxonomy]] which is concerned with the use of numerical methods for taxonomic classification. Many people contributed to the development of phenetics, but the most influential were [[Peter Sneath]] and [[Robert R. Sokal]]. Their books are still primary references for this sub-discipline, although now out of print.&lt;ref&gt;Sneath, P. H. A. &amp; R. R. Sokal. 1973. ''Numerical taxonomy &amp;mdash; The principles and practice of numerical classification''. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco. xv + 573 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phenetics has largely been superseded by [[cladistics]] for research into evolutionary relationships among species. However, certain phenetic methods, such as [[neighbor-joining]], have found their way into phylogenetics, as a reasonable approximation of phylogeny when more advanced methods (such as [[Bayesian inference]]) are too computationally expensive.

Phenetic techniques include various forms of [[Cluster analysis|clustering]] and [[Ordination (statistics)|ordination]]. These are sophisticated ways of reducing the variation displayed by organisms to a manageable level. In practice this means measuring dozens of variables, and then presenting them as two- or three-dimensional graphs. Much of the technical challenge in phenetics revolves around balancing the loss of information in such a reduction against the ease of interpreting the resulting graphs.

The method can be traced back to 1763 and [[Michel Adanson]] (in his ''Familles des plantes'') because of two shared basic principles &amp;mdash; overall similarity and equal weighting &amp;mdash; and modern pheneticists are sometimes called neo-Adansonians.&lt;ref&gt;Schuh, Randall. 2000. Biological Systematics, p. 6. Cornell U. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference from cladistics==
Phenetic analyses are [[Unrooted tree|unrooted]], that is, they do not distinguish between [[plesiomorph]]ies, traits that are inherited from an ancestor,  and [[apomorph]]ies, traits that [[evolved]] anew in one or several lineages. A common problem with phenetic analysis is that [[basal (evolution)|basal]] [[evolutionary grade]]s, which retain many plesiomorphies compared to more advanced lineages, appear to be [[monophyletic]]. Phenetic analyses are also liable to be misled by [[convergent evolution]] and [[adaptive radiation]]. Cladistic methods have attempted to solve those problems.

Consider for example [[songbird]]s. These can be divided into two groups – [[Corvida]], which retains ancient characters in [[phenotype]] and [[genotype]], and [[Passerida]], which has more modern traits. But only the latter are a group of closest relatives; the former are numerous independent and ancient lineages which are about as distantly related to each other as each single one of them is to the Passerida. In a phenetic analysis, the large degree of overall similarity found among the Corvida will make them appear to be [[monophyletic]] too, but their shared traits were present in the ancestors of ''all'' songbirds already. It is the loss of these ancestral traits rather than their presence that signifies which songbirds are more closely related to each other than to other songbirds. However, the requirement that taxa be monophyletic – rather than paraphyletic as in the case of the Corvida – is itself part of the cladistic view of Taxonomy, not necessarily followed to an absolute degree by other schools.

The two methodologies are not mutually exclusive. There is no reason why, e.g., species identified using phenetics cannot subsequently be subjected to cladistic analysis, to determine their evolutionary relationships. Phenetic methods can also be superior to cladistics when only the ''distinctness'' of related taxa is important, as the computational requirements are lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lindberg |first=David R. |title=Principals of Phylogenetic Systematics: Phenetics |url=http://ib.berkeley.edu/courses/ib200a/lect/ib200a_lect09_Lindberg_phenetics.pdf |work=Integrative Biology 200A Principles of Phylogenetics: Systematics |publisher=University of Berkeley |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of pheneticism and cladism as rival taxonomic systems is analysed in [[David Hull]]'s 1988 book ''Science as a Process''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hull, David L. |date=1988 |title=''Science as a process: an evolutionary account of the social and conceptual development of science'' |location=Chicago, Illinois |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
Traditionally there was a great deal of heated debate between pheneticists and cladists, as both methods were initially proposed to resolve evolutionary relationships. Perhaps the "high-water mark" of phenetics were the [[DNA-DNA hybridization]] studies by [[Charles G. Sibley]], [[Jon E. Ahlquist]] and [[Burt L. Monroe Jr.]], from which resulted the 1990 [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy]] for [[bird]]s. Highly controversial at its time, some of its findings (e.g. the [[Galloanserae]]) have been vindicated, while others (e.g. the all-inclusive "[[Ciconiiformes]]" or the "[[Corvida]]") have been rejected. However, with computers growing increasingly powerful and widespread, more refined cladistic [[algorithm]]s became available and could put the suggestions of [[Willi Hennig]] to the test; as it turned out, the results of cladistic analyses turned out to be superior to those of phenetic methods – at least when it came to resolving phylogenies.

Many systematists continue to use phenetic methods, particularly in addressing species-level questions. While a major goal of taxonomy remains describing the 'tree of life' – the evolutionary path connecting all species – in [[fieldwork]] one needs to be able to separate one [[taxon]] from another. Classifying diverse groups of closely related organisms that differ very subtly is difficult using a cladistic approach. Phenetics provides numerical tools for examining overall patterns of variation, allowing researchers to identify discrete groups that can be classified as species.

Modern applications of phenetics are common in [[botany]], and some examples can be found in most issues of the journal ''[[Systematic Botany]]''. Indeed, due to the effects of [[horizontal gene transfer]], [[polyploid complex]]es and other peculiarities of plant [[genomics]], phenetic techniques in botany – though less informative altogether – may, in these special cases, be less prone to errors compared with cladistic analysis of [[DNA sequence]]s.

In addition, many of the techniques developed by phenetic taxonomists have been adopted and extended by [[community ecology|community ecologists]], due to a similar need to deal with large amounts of data.&lt;ref&gt;Legendre, Pierre &amp; Louis Legendre. 1998. Numerical ecology. 2nd English edition. Elsevier Science BV, Amsterdam. xv + 853 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3829">'''Plastics engineering''' encompasses the processing, design, development, and manufacture of [[plastic]]s products. A plastic is a [[polymer]]ic material that is in a semi-liquid state, having the property of [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] and exhibiting flow. Plastics engineering encompasses plastics material and plastic machinery. Plastic Machinery is the general term for all types of machinery and devices used in the plastics processing industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plasticextrudermachine.com/plastics_engineering.html] Introduction of Plastics Engineering. PlASTICEXTRUDERMACHINE.COM&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of plastic materials poses unique challenges to an engineer. [[Mechanical properties]] of plastics are often difficult to quantify, and the plastics engineer has to design a product that meets certain specifications while keeping costs to a minimum. Other properties that the plastics engineer has to address include: outdoor weatherability, thermal properties such as upper use temperature, electrical properties, barrier properties, and resistance to chemical attack.

In plastics engineering, as in most [[engineering]] disciplines, the [[economics]] of a product plays an important role. The cost of plastic materials ranges from the cheapest [[commodity plastics]] used in [[mass production|mass-produced]] consumer products to the very expensive, specialty plastics. The cost of a plastic product is measured in different ways, and the absolute cost of a plastic material is difficult to ascertain. Cost is often measured in price per pound of material, or price per unit volume of material. In many cases however, it is important for a product to meet certain specifications, and cost could then be measured in price per unit of a property. Price with respect to processibility is often important, as some materials need to be processed at very high temperatures, increasing the amount of cooling time a part needs. In a large production run cooling time is very expensive.

Some plastics are manufactured from re-cycled materials but their use in engineering tends to be limited because the consistency of formulation and their physical properties tend to be less consistent. Electrical and electronic equipment and motor vehicle markets together accounted for 58 percent of engineered plastics demand in 2003.[http://mdmr.net/onesource/catalog/Engineered-Plastics-p-517.html] Engineered plastics demand in the US was estimated at $9,702 million in 2007.

A big challenge for plastics engineers is the reduction of the ecological footprints of their products. First attempts like the [[Vinyloop]] process can guarantee that a product's primary energy demand is 46 percent lower than conventional produced PVC. The [[global warming potential]] is 39 percent lower. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.solvayplastics.com/sites/solvayplastics/SiteCollectionDocuments/VinyLoop/The%20VinyLoop%20Eco-Footprint%20Study.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The core [[plane wave]] DFT functions of QE are provided by the PWscf component, PWscf previously existed as an independent project. '''PWscf''' ('''Plane-Wave Self-Consistent Field''') is a set of programs for [[electronic structure]] calculations within [[density functional theory]] and [[density functional perturbation theory]], using [[plane wave]] [[basis set (chemistry)|basis sets]] and [[pseudopotential]]s. The software is released under the [[GNU General Public License]].

The latest version QE-6.3.0 was released on 5 July 2018.

== QUANTUM ESPRESSO Project ==
Quantum ESPRESSO is an open initiative, of the CNR-IOM DEMOCRITOS National Simulation Center in Trieste (Italy) and its partners, in collaboration with different centers worldwide such as MIT, Princeton University, the University of Minnesota or the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. The project is coordinated by the QUANTUM ESPRESSO foundation which is formed by many research centers and groups all over the world. The first version called ''pw.1.0.0''''',''' was released on 15-06-2001.

The program, written mainly in [[Fortran 90|fortran-90]] with some parts in [[C (programming language)|C]] or in Fortran-77, was built out of the merging and re-engineering of different independently-developed core packages, plus a set of packages, designed to be inter-operable with the core components, which allow the performance of more advanced tasks. 

The basic packages include ''Pwscf'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-61478-1_10|title=Quantum-Mechanical Ab-initio Calculation of the Properties of Crystalline Materials|last=Corso|first=Andrea Dal|date=1996|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=9783540616450|series=Lecture Notes in Chemistry|pages=155–178|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-61478-1_10}}&lt;/ref&gt; which solves the self-consistent Kohn and Sham equations, obtained for a periodic solid, ''CP'' to carry out Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics, and ''PostProc'', which allows data analysis and plotting. Regarding the additional packages, is noteworthy to point out ''atomic'' for the pseudopotential generation, ''PHonon package, w''hich implements density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT) for the calculation of second- and third-order derivatives of the energy with respect to atomic displacements and ''NEB'': for the calculation of reaction pathways and energy barriers.

== Target problems ==
The different tasks that can be performed include
* Ground state calculations.
* Structural optimization.
* Transition states and minimum energy paths.
* Response properties (DFPT), such as phonon frequencies, electron-phonon interactions and [[Electron paramagnetic resonance|EPR]] and [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] chemical shifts.
* AB initio Molecular Dynamics: [[Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics|Car-Parinello]] and Born-Oppenheimer MD.
* Spectroscopic properties.
* Quantum transport.

== Parallelization ==
The main components of the QUANTUM ESPRESSO distribution are designed to exploit the architecture of today’s supercomputers characterized by multiple levels and layers of inter-processor communication . The parallelization is achieved using both [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]] and [[OpenMP]] parallelization, allowing the main codes of the distribution to run in parallel on most or all parallel machines with very good performance.

'''''Secrets and Lies''''', subtitled ''"the anatomy of an anti-environmental PR campaign"'', is a 1999 book by [[Nicky Hager]] and [[Bob Burton (journalist)|Bob Burton]].

==The book==
The book documents the [[public relations]] information put out by [[Timberlands West Coast Limited]] in order to win public support for logging of native forests on the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]] of [[New Zealand]].

The material is based on a large amount of documentation leaked by a staff member from the local branch of Shandwick (now [[Weber Shandwick Worldwide]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | author= Weber Shandwick | title = History | work =  | publisher =  Weber Shandwick | date =  | url = http://www.webershandwick.com/overview/index.cfm/contentid,1217.html | doi = | accessdate = 2007-05-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070430192145/http://www.webershandwick.com/overview/index.cfm/contentid,1217.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; a global public relations company, which had been hired by Timberlands to run a secret campaign against environmental groups such as [[Native Forest Action]] between 1997 and 1999.

The book describes its tactics of surveillance of meetings, monitoring the press and responding to every letter to the editor, [[greenwashing]], the use of [[SLAPP#New Zealand|SLAPPs]], cleaning anti-logging graffiti and blotting out campaign posters in public places, and managing to install its pro-logging educational materials into schools.

The book alleges that almost every pro-logging letter or article was organized by this campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hager|first=Nicky|title=Secrets and Lies|publisher=Craig Potton Publishing|location=New Zealand; Nelson|year=1999 |isbn=0-908802-57-9 |page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and responses==
In 2000, a press council complaint was made against a letter to the editor in ''The Press'', which argued that Hager had lied in the book. The complaint was not upheld, because the Press Council ruled that it was responsible for vetting robust debate in the letter pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.presscouncil.org.nz/display_ruling.php?case_number=794 | title=Case Number: 794 K. V. BYTHELL AGAINST THE PRESS | work=New Zealand Press Council | accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a general Parliamentary debate in November 2006, when the book ''[[The Hollow Men (book)|The Hollow Men]]'' had an injunction against its publication, the MP [[Gerry Brownlee]] said of the author and the book:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/debates/debates/speeches/48HansS_20061122_00000781/brownlee-gerry-general-debate | title=Brownlee, Gerry;  General Debate | publisher=[[New Zealand Parliament]] | work=Hansard (debates) Volume:635;Page:6711 | date=November 22, 2006 | accessdate=May 20, 2015 | author=speaker [[Gerry Brownlee]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|This is the same Nicky Hager who wrote the book [Secrets and Lies] in 1999, in which he spoke about the Timberlands scandal. None of it was true. Not one of the pages in that book carried a single truth. It was roundly discredited. He is a man who indulges in intrigue and in the activities of scurrilously besmirching any individual he does not like, without any care whatsoever.}}

''The Hollow Men'' documents behind the scenes activities of the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], of which Brownlee was deputy leader at the time.

In 2009, Kerry Tankard looked back at the book in a review for ''[[Salient (magazine)|Salient]]''. She concluded that: "As a study of how PR firms help corporations to spin and manipulate public opinion, I’ve seen none better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://salient.org.nz/arts/books/secrets-and-lies | title=Secrets and Lies | work=Salient | date=9 March 2009 | accessdate=9 February 2015 | author=Tankard, Kerry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''technological and industrial history of Canada''' encompasses the country's development in the areas of transportation, communication, energy, materials, public works, public services (health care), domestic/consumer and defence technologies.

The terms chosen for the "age" described below are both literal and metaphorical. They describe the technology that dominated the period of time in question but are also representative of a large number of other technologies introduced during the same period. Also of note is the fact that the period of diffusion of a technology can begin modestly and can extend well beyond the "age" of its introduction. To maintain continuity, the treatment of its diffusion is dealt with in the context of its dominant "age".

Technology is a major cultural determinant, no less important in shaping human lives than philosophy, religion, social organization, or political systems. In the broadest sense, these forces are also aspects of technology. The French sociologist Jacques Ellul defined ''la technique'' as the totality of all rational methods in every field of human activity so that, for example, education, law, sports, propaganda, and the social sciences are all technologies in that sense. At the other end of the scale, common parlance limits the term's meaning to specific industrial arts.

== The late Electric Age (1901–1920) ==

===Industrial processes and techniques===
Metal mining also became significant industry during this period. The International Nickel Company ([[Vale Inco|Inco]]) was established in 1902 through the fusion of two companies. A refinery using the Orford process was built in Port Colborne, Ontario in 1918 and then moved to Copper Cliff, Ontario, where that technique was replaced by the matte flotation process in 1948. Hard rock gold mining became practical in 1887, with the development of the potassium cyanidation process, by Scott MacArthur, which was used to separate the gold from the ore. This technique was first used in Canada at the Mikado Mine in the Lake-of-the-Woods Region again made accessible by the CPR.  The CPR also provided access to the B.C. interior, where lead, copper, silver and gold ores had been discovered in the Rossland area in 1891. The ores were transported to Trail, B.C., where they were roasted. After CPR built the Crowsnest Pass it purchased the Trail roasting facility and in 1899 built a blast furnace to smelt lead ore. In 1902 the first electrolytic lead refining plant using the Betts Cell Process began operation in Trail.  The Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada Ltd. was founded as a CPR subsidiary and began to develop the Sullivan Mine with its lead, zinc and silver ores, in Kimberley in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Mouat, Jeremy, Metal Mining in Canada, 1840 −1950, Transformation Series 9, National Museum of Science and Technology, Ottawa, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1912 the Dominion Coal Company produced 40% of Canada’s total coal output.&lt;ref&gt;Muise, McIntosh, Coal Mining in Canada: A Historical and Comparative Overview, Transformation Series 5, National Museum of Science and Technology, Ottawa, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 a company in Bowmanville, Ontario, began Canada’s first [[powdered milk]] production operation. The large-scale home delivery of milk began in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal in 1900.

===Materials===
Railway and locomotive construction in the latter 19th century created a huge demand for [[steel]]. The Bessemer furnace at the Algom steel mill in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario went into operation in 1902. The [[Montreal Rolling Mills]] Co, The [[Hamilton Steel and Iron Company]], the Canada Screw Company, the Canada Bolt and Nut Company, and the Dominion Wire Manufacturing Company were consolidated in 1910 to form The [[Stelco|Steel Company of Canada]] headquartered in Toronto. With mills located in Hamilton and other cities, it was the largest producer of steel in Canada for most of the century. Its competitor, the Dominion Steel Castings Company Limited founded in 1912, renamed the Dominion Foundries and Steel Company in 1917 and [[Dofasco]] in 1980, had its Hamilton facilities located next to those of [[Stelco]].

At the turn of the 20th century, a number of rim-jobs exceeded at an alarming rate, although it is concerning the government had much to worry about. Health concerns were identified, and its use was generally discontinued by the late 20th century.

The modern version of [[plywood]] was invented in the US in 1905 in Portland, Oregon. In 1913, the Fraser Mills in New Westminster, British Columbia, produced the first Canadian plywood, primarily from Douglas fir. This new material eventually found use in a wide variety of structures, including auto running boards, panelling, sub-floors, roof sheathing, wall sheathing, shipping crates and, during World War II, the manufacturing of aircraft and small ships.
 
The [[pulp and paper]] industry also developed during these years. The closely related sulphate pulp process was introduced in Canada in 1907, when the Brompton Pulp &amp; Paper Company began operation in East Angus, Quebec. This process dominates the industry to this day. The pulp slurry was fed in a continuous stream into a paper-making machine that flattened, pressed and dried it into newsprint on huge rolls many metres wide and containing thousands of meters of paper.

===Office automation===
Business and public administration was improved and simplified with the introduction of the [[typewriter]], which acquired a familiar standardized form by about 1910, which features the "qwerty" keyboard, the typebar, ribbon, cylinder and carriage return lever. Popular models in Canada were manufactured by the US Remington and Underwood companies, among others. The introduction of the mechanical [[desk calculator]] complemented that of the typewriter. Most machines used in Canada were manufactured in the US by companies such as Friden, Monroe, and SCM/Marchant. The Gestetner copy machine, which used the stencil technique to reproduce copies of documents, was invented in England in 1881 by [[David Gestetner]] and quickly became popular in offices around the world, including those in Canada.

===Public works and civil engineering===
Notable works of civil engineering realized the completion of: the [[New Westminster Bridge]], Vancouver 1904, the Lethbridge Viaduct, Lethbridge, Alberta, 1909, the [[Spiral Tunnels]], Hector to Field BC, 1909, the St. Andrew's Lock and Dam, Lockport, Manitoba, 1910,  the Brooks Aqueduct, Brooks, Albert, 1914, the [[Quebec Bridge]], Ste-Foy, Quebec, 1916, the [[Connaught Tunnel]], Rogers Pass, BC, 1916, the Ogden Point Breakwater and Docks, Victoria, British Columbia, 1917, the Prince Edward Viaduct, Toronto, Ontario, 1919, the Shoal Lake Aqueduct, Winnipeg, Manitoba, 1919 and the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]], Ontario, 1920.

In the 1930s diesel-powered excavation shovels replaced steam shovels for the excavation of railway right-of-ways and the digging of basements and foundations for skyscrapers and domestic housing, in the late 19th century.

===Skyscrapers and architecture ===
It was the age of the [[skyscraper]] and the race to build the tallest structure in the British Empire set off a competition among cities across Canada. Successive record holders included the Traders Bank of Canada, 15 floors, Yonge St, Toronto, 1905, the Dominion Building, 13 floors, Vancouver, 1910, World (Sun) Tower, 17 floors, Vancouver, 1912, the Canadian Pacific Building, 16 floors, Toronto, 1913, the Royal Bank, 20 floors, Toronto, 1915, the Royal Bank, Montreal, 1928, the Royal York Hotel, Toronto, 1929 and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Toronto, in 1931.

===Central heating===
The construction of skyscrapers, grand hotels and other large buildings led to the development of [[central heating]], an essential feature in Canada's cold climate. In the 20th century such systems were used to provide heat to small communities such as university campuses, northern industrial towns or military bases. Smaller systems were used in private homes. Another technique, the convection method, was introduced to domestic dwellings at this time. A metal furnace in the basement, using wood or coal as fuel, would heat air in a plenum which would rise by convection through a series of metal ducts into the rooms of the house above. When the air cooled it would fall to the floor and return to the plenum through another series of metal return ducts. In later years an electric fan was used to force the hot air from the plenum through the ducts.

===Domestic and consumer technology===

The introduction of the flush toilet in the US and Canada in the 1880s created a market that inspired the invention of rolled [[toilet paper]]. The product was first produced in the US by the Albany Perforated Wrapping Paper Company in 1877. The US Scott Paper Company began manufacturing toilette paper in 1902 and by 1925 Scott Paper was the largest manufacturer of toilette paper in the world. As early as 1926 the Purex brand had been established in Canada and with the arrival of Scott Paper Canada in 1927 the White Swan brand was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Web site, About.com, inventors.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?zi=1/XJ&amp;sdn=inventors&amp;cdn=money&amp;tm=14&amp;gps=94_60_978_623&amp;f=10&amp;tt=2&amp;bt=1&amp;bts=1&amp;zu=http%3A//www.toiletpaperworld.com/tpw/encyclopedia/navigation/funfacts.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
The introduction of medical [[x-ray]]s during this period dramatically improved medical diagnostics. Discovered by Roentgen in Germany in 1895, x-ray units were in operation at the Toronto and [[Montreal General Hospital]]s by the turn of the century. The sphygmomanometer or blood pressure meter, that familiar device employing a cuff placed around the patients arm, found its way into the office of most Canadian doctors in the early 20th century. The spread of bovine tuberculosis, a crippling childhood disease, was curbed through the introduction of pasteurized milk in Montreal and Toronto at the turn of the century. This practice was soon followed by the dairy industry across Canada.

Bayer began marketing the wonder drug of the age, [[Aspirin]], in 1899. It was an instant success and quickly became popular in Canada. Originally sold as a powder, the tablet was introduced in 1914. A very important step in the mass production of medical products was taken that same year when Dr. John Fitzgerald founded an institution that would be named the [[Connaught Laboratories]] in 1917, at the University of Toronto. Initially the laboratories produced vaccines and antitoxins for smallpox, tetanus, diphtheria and rabies. In 1922 after the Nobel Prize winning work on Dr. Banting and Dr. Best the facility began to manufacture insulin.

In 1914 Dr. John Fitzgerald established laboratories in Toronto to produce vaccines for smallpox, rabies, diphtheria and tetanus. The facility was named the Connaught laboratories in 1917 in honour of Prince Albert, the Duke of Connaught the recently retired Governor General. Beginning in 1922 the laboratories began to mass-produce the newly discovered hormone [[insulin]].

The [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] of municipal drinking water, a technique known to kill bacteria and thus make the water safer for human consumption, was introduced in Toronto in 1910. It became widely used across Canada in the years that followed.&lt;ref&gt;Drinking Water Management in Ontario: A Brief History, Ontario Sewer and Watermain Construction Association, January 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defence===
The 13- and 18-pound muzzle-loading gun field gun with modern recoil and sighting systems were acquired at the turn of the century. A notable acquisition was the first breech-loading gun, in Canadian use, the 13-pound quick-firing (Q.F.) and 18-pound Q.F. firing shrapnel and high-explosive rounds, in 1905. The [[Royal Canadian Navy]] founded in 1910, took possession of its first ships, two tired steel-hulled former Royal Navy cruisers, the ''Rainbow'', in 1910, stationed at Esquimalt on the west coast and the ''Niobe'' at Halifax on the east coast.

== The Automobile Age (1920–1950) ==

During the post-World War I era, a plethora of technologies were introduced, including the car, air service, air navigation, paved roads, radio, the telephone, refrigeration, wonder drugs and powered farming, mining and forestry equipment.

===Transportation, the car and aeroplane===
The [[Ford Motor Company of Canada]], founded in Windsor, Ontario in 1904, was the first major company to introduce the automobile to Canada. It manufactured cars in that city and was the first company to use the [[assembly line]] manufacturing technique in Canada. Facilities were established in the McGregor wagon factory in Walkerville (now part of Windsor), where the first vehicle off the line was a Model C. Production of the Model T was introduced in 1909 and by 1913 the company was manufacturing motors, the first [[internal combustion engines]] built in Canada, at the Windsor plant. A number of different types, all based on US designs, were manufactured including, the [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Ford Model-A]], Ford Model-C, Ford Model-K, Ford Model-N and [[Ford Model-T]]. During WWII, the Canadian Military Pattern Truck, was built there. Following the war, the Ford Meteor was assembled until production moved to the new Ford plant in Oakville in 1953, where production has continued until this day.

In 1918 the McLaughlin Motor Company, Ltd. of Oshawa, Ontario and the Chevrolet Motor Company of Canada Ltd. merged to form [[General Motors of Canada]] and became a subsidiary of the US-owned General Motors Corporation. The company manufactured Buicks, Oldsmobiles and Oaklands on its assembly line in Oshawa.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Heather, Driving Force, The McLaughlin Family and the Age of the Car, McClelland &amp; Stewart, Toronto, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Chrysler Canada]], established in Windsor, began vehicle assembly in that city in 1936. [[Studebaker Canada Ltd.]] manufactured cars and trucks at a plant in Hamilton, Ontario from 1947 to 1966.

The automobile was a hit with Canadians. In 1904 there were 535 cars in Ontario, by 1913 there were 50,000 in Canada, by 1916, 123,000, by 1922, 513,000 and by 1930, 1,076,000. Of note was Thomas Wilby's Trans-Canada road trip, the first by automobile across Canada, from Halifax to Victoria, in 1912, on a series of highways that became known as the All Red Route. As the car gained in popularity local automobile clubs were founded. In 1913 nine of these clubs from across the country got together to form the [[Canadian Automobile Association]].

Cars required [[gasoline]], and the first service station in Canada was built in Vancouver on Smythe Street in 1907. Most early stations were informal curb-side affairs, and it was not until the twenties that the filling station as we know it began to appear, with [[Imperial Oil]] building architect-designed stations for its customers. By 1928 Imperial had evolved three standard filling station designs for different locations: business district, urban residential and small town/leased property. In the 1920s, gasoline itself was modified by the addition of [[tetraethyllead]] to reduce premature detonation of the gas-air mixture in the cylinder, commonly described as knock, in [[internal combustion engines]]. Both health and environmental problems would later become associated with leaded gasoline.

The popularity of the car also had a dramatic impact on urban infrastructure and roads in particular. The dirt, gravel, tar and occasionally cobblestone that characterized most city roads was inadequate for the automobile and towns and cities and provinces across Canada began paving projects creating roads of asphalt and concrete that were more suitable. The [[traffic light]] was also introduced to help regulate the congestion that began to arise in the twenties especially in larger cities like Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. The first in Canada was installed at the corner of Bloor St. and Yonge St. in Toronto in 1925.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Guillet, Edwin C., The Story of Canadian Roads, University of Toronto Press, Toronto, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; The operation of cars on the newly paved roads in a snowy climate necessitated the use of a technology for keeping roads clear for cars in winter. Municipalities and provinces acquired [[snowplow]]s, fleets of trucks with steel blades attached to the front bumper to clear city and provincial roads. The use of crushed rock salt for melting snow and ice on roads was also introduced during this period. The technique was effective but unfortunately proved to be very corrosive to steel and concrete. This had serious consequences for the undercarriage of the steel vehicles that used the roads in winter as well as the roads themselves along with bridges and parking lots.

The popularity of the car in urban areas also lead to the introduction of the [[parking meter]] in the centre of most urban areas. Invented in the US in 1935 it progressively found its way onto city streets across Canada in the years that followed.

The car began to compete with the [[streetcar]] in the thirties and forties and many cities reduced or abandoned this service. New suburbs were built without streetcar lines and urban diesel powered buses were used to provide public transport. Only a handful of cities continued to maintain streetcar service into the fifties and beyond, most notably Toronto which to this day has a very elaborate public streetcar network.

The auto-craze gave rise to a booming do-it-yourself car maintenance and repair movement with businesses specializing in car parts and tools becoming popular. One of the notable firm in this field, the familiar, [[Canadian Tire]], began operations in Toronto in 1922 and has become one of Canada's largest retailers.

Long distance travel by aircraft became increasingly important and practical in the postwar years. Taking off in a Vickers Vimy IV bomber from Lester's Field in St. Johns, Newfoundland on 14 June 1919, John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown, ([[Alcock and Brown]]) made the first trans-Atlantic flight, crash landing in Ireland 16 hours later. The first cross-Canada flight began in Halifax on 7 October 1920 and ended in Vancouver ten days later.

In the twenties and thirties the Canadian north was developed with the help of hundreds of small float equipped "bush planes" used to fly men and supplies to mining, forestry, trapping and fishing camps. The first commercial air passenger flight in Canada was made in 1920, when two bush pilots flew a fur buyer from Winnipeg to The Pas, Manitoba.   National passenger air service was introduced  by [[Trans-Canada Airlines]] beginning in 1937 and [[Canadian Pacific Airlines]] starting in 1942.

Of note was the attempt by Britain to establish an airship service between that country and Canada and a related test flight by the British built dirigible the [[R-100]] was made in July 1930. After a successful crossing of the Atlantic the giant craft moored at a mast especially constructed for that purpose at St. Hubert near Montreal. The ship flew on to Toronto before finally returning to Britain. However, technical problems with the craft prevented further flights and the idea of a Trans-Atlantic lighter-than-air passenger service was abandoned.

To facilitate the development of a national aviation service the Government of Canada created a kind of national highway in the sky called the Trans-Canada Airway consisting of airports, radio and weather services and lighting for night flying, at various locations across Canada. Construction started in 1929 but was slowed by the depression. The western leg from Vancouver to Winnipeg was completed in 1938. The section from Winnipeg to Toronto and Montreal was inaugurated in 1939 and the extensions to Moncton, Halifax and St. John's completed in 1940, 1941 and 1942 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Milberry, Larry, Aviation in Canada, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, Toronto, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communications, radio===
In 1901, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] sent radio signals across the Atlantic Ocean. He established a machine to produce electromagnetic waves at Cornwall in England and a machine to detect these waves at Signal Hill in St. John's Newfoundland. On 12 December 1901 he announced that he had received the transmission of waves sent by the transmitter in England at the station in St John’s.&lt;ref&gt;Babaian, Sharon, A., Radio Communication in Canada : An Historical and Technological Survey, The Transformation Series, No. 1, National Museum of Science and Technology, Ottawa, Canada, 1992, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;    
 
In Montreal, in 1920, XWA ([[CINW (AM)]]) became the first commercial [[AM radio]] broadcaster in the world. Both the AM transmitter and receiver used analog technology. The following year CKAC became the first French- language AM radio broadcaster in Canada. State operated national radio broadcasting chains were established beginning in the late 1920s, including the CNR National Radio Network, 1927, the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission Radio Network, 1932 and the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] Radio Network, 1936. Private independent AM broadcast operations sprouted like mushrooms in cities large and small across Canada during the thirties and forties. Canadian Marconi Company ([[CMC Electronics]]) formed in Montreal in 1903 and [[Nortel|Northern Electric]], manufactured radios for home use, the first mass-produced electronic equipment in Canada. The circuits of these devises were based on analog technology.

The [[teleprinter]] became a popular technology with telegraph companies beginning in 1922. When used with the telegraph system it permitted the automated printing of thousands of telegraph messages and became the backbone of the telegram service offered by the Canadian National Telegraph Company formed in 1920 and the Canadian Pacific Telegraph Company.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Robert, A Voice from Afar, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, Toronto, 1977, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[wirephoto]], was introduced in the US by Associated Press in 1935. This technology permitted the transmission of a photograph by use of telephone wires and became widely used by newspapers for reporting purposes. The technology was quickly introduced to Canada by Canadian Press (1917), which provided the service to newspapers across the country. Canadian Press also became the exclusive provider of Canadian wirephotos for Associated Press.

The Canadian film industry experienced mixed success during the twenties and thirties. Film maker Ernest Shipman produced five features between 1920 and 1923 before meeting with financial failure. The successful Canadian-owned Allen Theatre chain attained an important place in the exhibition market before being taken over by Famous Players Canadian Corporation ([[Cineplex Entertainment]]) in 1923. The technology of the talking cinema or "talkies" was introduced to Canada in 1927 by that company to take advantage of the arrival of talking films produced in Hollywood. The first Canadian "talkie" was "The Viking", an adventure story about sealing off the coast of Newfoundland, produced in 1931.

[[Associated Screen News of Canada]] in Montreal produced two notable newsreel series, "Kinograms" in the twenties and "Canadian Cameo" from 1932 to 1953. The regular production of short films by the newly created Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau began in the 1930s. British law encouraging filmmaking in the Commonwealth led Hollywood to circumvent the spirit of the concept by establishing film production companies to make American films in Calgary, Toronto, Montreal and Victoria. These companies produced a small number of features but closed operations when the British law was changed to exclude their films. In 1941, Odeon Theatres of Canada opened a new cinema chain to compete with Famous Players.

The making of documentary films grew tremendously during World War II with the creation of the [[National Film Board of Canada]] in 1939. By 1945 it was one of the major film production studios in the world with a staff of nearly 800 and over 500 films to its credit, including the very popular ''The World in Action'' and ''Canada Carries On'' series of monthly propaganda films.

===Materials===
[[Plastics]] were also introduced during these years. In Toronto, Plastics Ltd. began to produce Bakelite soon after its invention in 1909. Another firm, Canadian Electro Products of Shawinigan, Quebec, invented [[polyvinyl acetate]] which was used in copolymer resins and water-based paints. The wartime production of nitrocellulose naturally led to the manufacture at Shawinigan in 1932, of transparent cellulose film used for packaging. What is now called [[fibreglass]] was invented in the US in 1938 at [[Owens-Corning]] by [[Russell Games Slayter]] and introduced to Canada shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Warrington, Newbold, Chemical Canada: Past and Present, The Chemical Institute of Canada, Ottawa, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;
    
[[Aluminum]] also became popular. In 1902, attracted by the availability of cheap hydro power, the Aluminum Company of America established a Canadian subsidiary, the Northern Aluminum Company ([[Alcan]]) at Shawinigan Falls, Quebec to produce that metal using the electrolysis technique. Corporate changes led to the creation of the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan) in 1925 and in 1926 the company constructed a giant aluminum smelter at a place it named Arvida, Quebec. Once again the site was chosen for the availability of cheap hydro electricity and the proximity of a deep-water port at Bagotville for large ships carrying bauxite or aluminum ore. World War II accelerated the demand for aluminum, which was the principal material in aircraft production and the Arvida facility was greatly expanded. In 1958 another huge Alcan smelter was built at Kitimat, British Columbia.

The growth in popularity of the car also created a need for rubber for automobile tires. Accelerated by the emergency of World War II, a substantial [[synthetic rubber]] production industry was established at Sarnia, Ontario in the early forties. The oil refineries there provided a ready source of raw materials. In particular, the Suspensiod crackers operated there by Imperial Oil produced large quantities of hydrocarbon gases. These were used by a new Crown enterprise, [[Polymer Corporation]] created in 1942, and associated private companies, St. Clair Processing Corporation Ltd., Dow Chemical of Canada Ltd., and Canadian Synthetic Rubber Ltd., itself a subsidiary of four Canadian rubber companies, Dominion, Firestone, Goodyear and Goodrich, to produce both GR-S and butyl type synthetic rubber. Initially production was destined for wartime use on military vehicles but in postwar years output was quickly redirected to civilian automobile production.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The closely related synthetic textile industry appeared in the years just after the First War. The production of artificial silk, more properly known as viscose [[rayon]], made from bleached wood pulp, began in Cornwall, Ontario in 1925, in a factory built by [[Courtaulds]] (Canada). A year later [[Celanese]] Canada began making acetate yarn in a new plant in Drummondville, Quebec. [[DuPont]] Canada was the first to manufacture [[nylon]] yarn in Canada at its factory in Kingston, Ontario in 1942. This secret material was initially used for parachutes but following the war was used to make nylon stockings.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

[[Asbestos]] has long been known for its fibrous and heat resistant properties. With the rise of the automobile, asbestos became an important material, being used to make brakes. The world's largest asbestos mine, the Jeffrey Mine in Asbestos, Quebec had its beginnings in the 1878 when a local farmer W. H. Jeffrey began to mine the substance there. Original mining methods were primitive and involved blasting, the use of chisels to remove the mineral from the rock by hand and a crane powered by one horse. By 1895, 2300 tons of asbestos were being removed from the open pit mine per year. The mine was purchased by the Johns-Manville Company of the US in 1918 and has since become the largest asbestos mine in the world, over two kilometres in diameter and 350 metres deep. The material was used for insulation in buildings and ships and, of course, for automobile brakes. However, serious health problems, including lung cancer, have been associated with its mining and use, and in recent years mining activity there has diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Kuyek,  Asbestos Mining in Canada:
A brief presented to the International Ban Asbestos Conference,
Ottawa, September 13, 2003,  MiningWatch Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry===
With the rail building era coming to an end, the rise of the [[automotive industry]] in southern Ontario provided the Hamilton steel mills of the Steel Company of Canada and the Dominion Foundries and Steel Company with a new market. Dofasco introduced the [[basic oxygen steelmaking]] at its mills in Hamilton in 1954. In the latter part of the century, Algoma, in Sault Ste. Marie, built coke oven batteries and blast furnaces, while phasing out the open-hearth and Bessemer steel-making process in favour of the basic oxygen steel-making.

The industrial production of [[bread]] became notable during these years. At the beginning of the 20th century it is estimated that only about 8% of Canadian wives bought bread commercially. However, the industrial production of bread grew impressively and by the 1960s, 95% of homemakers purchased bread commercially. One bakery of note, The Canada Bread Company Limited, was founded in 1911 as the result of the amalgamation of five smaller companies. Industrial bakeries such as this were characterized by the use of large machines for the mixing of dough, which was placed in pans on slow moving conveyor belts that transported them through giant ovens, where they were baked. Large automated packaging machines wrapped the finished loaves at great speed. Improvements in transportation and packaging technology throughout the decades allowed a shrinking number of bakeries to serve every larger markets. In 1939 there were about 3200 commercial bakeries across the country but by 1973 the figure stood at 1700, while in 1981 there were 1400.

[[Meat packing]] grew to become Canada's most important food processing industry during this period. In Calgary, Alberta, in 1890, Pat Burns established P. Burns and Company, which became the largest meat processor in western Canada. In Toronto in 1896 the innovative Harris Abbatoir was established to export chilled sides of beef to the British market. The industry grew rapidly during the war, supplying meat to Canadian and British troops overseas. However, it underwent a period of consolidation in the twenties due to a loss of markets. This led to the merger of two major players, William Davies and the Harris Abattoir, to form [[Canada Packers]] in Toronto. By 1930, "The Big Three", meat packers in Canada were Canada Packers, Swift Canadian and P.Burns and Company in Calgary, Alberta.

The increasing popularity of the electric [[refrigerator]] in Canadian restaurants and homes made it practical for manufacturers to make available various [[frozen foods]]. The first such offering, a frozen strawberry pack was produced in Montreal and Ottawa beginning in 1932 by Heeney Frosted Foods Ltd.

===Consumer technology===
Cold [[breakfast cereal]] became increasingly popular during these years. Wheat and later corn flakes were developed in the US by the Kellogg brothers in 1894 and the Kellogg Company was formed in 1906. In London, Ontario the Canadian Corn Company purchased the rights to manufacture and distribute Toasted Corn Flakes for Canadian distribution. In 1924 the American Kellogg Company purchased the London operation and formed Kellogg Canada Inc. Since that time the company has manufactured and distributed in Canada a wide variety of breakfast cereals including Corn Flakes, 1907, Bran Flakes, 1915, All Bran, 1916 and Rice Krispies, 1928.

Although neither the tin can nor soups were remarkable in any way in the thirties, the combination of the two in the form of the well known Campbell’s soup was very popular. The [[Campbell Soup Company]] introduced its soup products to Canada in 1930, making them at its factory in Toronto on the lake shore.

[[Instant coffee]] was another tasty innovation introduced during these years. The inventor and world leader in the manufacture of instant coffee, the Swiss-based [[Nestlé]] Company began operations in Canada with the production of canned condensed milk at its plant, The Maple Leaf Condensed Milk Company, in Chesterville, Ontario in 1918. Head office research invented instant coffee and began selling it around the world including Canada, as Nescafe in 1938. It became hugely popular with allied troops during World War II. In 1952 the instant chocolate drink, Nestle Quik, was introduced to Canada.

The [[sanitary napkin]] and [[Kleenex]] brand facial tissue were introduced in the 1920s. Kimberly, Clark and Co. ([[Kimberly Clark]]) formed in the US in 1872, invented cellucotton in 1914. It used this material as the basis for a sanitary napkin and marketed the product as [[Kotex]] beginning in 1920. Kleenex, initially intended for the removal of face cream, was introduced in 1924. In 1925 the company formed what would become, Canadian Cellucotton Products Limited, for the marketing of these and other products in Canada and internationally. The first practical electric [[razor]], the Sunbeam "Shavemaster" and the Remington "Close Shaver" made available in the US in 1937 and in Canada shortly thereafter.

With a base of [[caustic soda]], the world's first oven cleaner, [[Easy-Off]], was invented in Regina in 1932 by Herbert McCool and manufactured in his home in that city until 1946, when production shifted to Iberville, Quebec. The product has since become the most popular oven cleaner in the world.

=== Architecture ===
The grand hotel continued to make a mark with new structures, including the Bigwinn Inn, Muskoka, Ontario, 1920, the [[Jasper Park Lodge]], Jasper, Alberta, 1922, the Hotel Newfoundland, St. John's, Newfoundland, 1926, the Hotel Saskatchewan, Regina, Saskatchewan, 1927, the Prince of Wales Hotel, Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, 1927, the Lord Nelson Hotel, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 1928, The Pines, Digby, Nova Scotia, 1929, the [[Fairmont Royal York|Royal York Hotel]], Toronto, 1929, the [[Chateau Montebello]], Montebello, Quebec, 1930, the Nova Scotian Hotel, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 1930, the Charlottetown Hotel, Charlottetown, P.E.I. and the Bessborough Hotel, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, 1935.

In 1875 in Montreal, a McGill student, J. Creighton, established the basic rules for [[hockey]] as we know it today. The world's first facility dedicated to hockey, the Westmount Arena was built in Montreal in 1898 while the first industrial refrigeration equipment for making artificial ice in Canada was installed in 1911 by Frank and Lester Patrick for their new arenas in Vancouver and Victoria. The [[Mutual Street Arena]], with its artificial ice surface, was built in Toronto in 1912. With the development of wide span roof structures the construction of large indoor ice rink stadiums became possible. These two technologies were used to build the [[Montreal Forum]], home of the legendary [[Montreal Canadiens]] hockey team, in Montreal in 1924 and [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] home of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], in that city in 1931. Baseball's facilities were upgraded with construction of the new [[Maple Leaf Stadium]] on [[Lake Shore Boulevard]] in Toronto in 1926 and the De Lormier Downs Stadium (Hector Racine Stadium), in Montreal in 1927. Civic Stadium, now Ivor Wynne Stadium, was built in Hamilton, Ontario in 1930, to host the British Empire Games held there that year.

The construction of the very large, [[Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré]], near Quebec city was completed in 1926.

There were also advances in the lighting of public, commercial and industrial buildings. In 1938, after decades of development in  the US and Europe, General Electric in the US, and shortly thereafter Westinghouse, began to sell the [[fluorescent lamp]]. Because of its lower power consumption its use was quickly adopted for large-scale applications. These lights were quickly made available to the Canadian market through the Canadian subsidiaries of these two companies.

===Civil engineering and public works===
Notable engineering works of the period included the [[Second Narrows Bridge]], Vancouver, 1925, the R.C. Harris Filtration Plant, Toronto, Ontario, 1926, the [[Peace Bridge]], Fort Erie, Ontario, 1927, the [[Champlain Bridge (Ottawa)]], 1928, the Ocean Terminals, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 1928, Sea Island Airport ([[Vancouver International Airport]]), Vancouver, 1929, the [[Ambassador Bridge]], Windsor-Detroit, 1929, the [[Windsor-Detroit Tunnel]], 1930, the [[Broadway Bridge (Saskatoon)|Broadway Bridge]], Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, 1932, the [[Île d'Orléans Bridge]], near Quebec City, 1934, the [[Thousand Islands Bridge]], Ontario, 1937, the [[Pattullo Bridge]], Vancouver, 1937, the [[Lion's Gate Bridge]], Vancouver, British Columbia, 1938, Malton Airport ([[Toronto Pearson International Airport]]), Toronto, 1938, the [[Blue Water Bridge]], Sarnia, Ontario, 1938, the [[Queen Elizabeth Way]], Ontario, 1939, the [[Rainbow Bridge (Niagara Falls)]], 1941, Dorval Airport, ([[Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport]]), Montreal, 1941 and the [[Alaska Highway]], Dawson Creek, British Columbia, 1942.

Canada’s first major [[roller coaster]] the [[Crystal Beach Cyclone]] was built at the Crystal Beach Amusement park in 1927. It quickly gained a reputation for its wild and even violent ride and one passenger, Amos Wiedrich was killed in 1938 when he stood up to take off his coat while the coaster was in motion.

The [[dump truck]] and [[bulldozer]] were introduced during these years for a variety of earth moving tasks including road building and canal construction. The dump truck was invented in Saint John, New Brunswick in 1920 by Robert T. Mawhinney and the bulldozer was developed in the US in 1923. Both quickly became popular worldwide.

===Medicine===
Medical treatment benefited from the introduction of the [[electrocardiograph]], used to diagnose heart problems, in large hospitals in the late twenties. There were also important innovations with respect to the treatment of epilepsy during this period. In Montreal, Dr. Wilder Penfield, with a grant from the US Rockefeller Foundation, founded the [[Montreal Neurological Institute]] at the [[Royal Victoria Hospital (Montreal)]], in 1934 to study and treat epilepsy and other neurological diseases.

===Defence and nuclear technology===
The military suffered a huge decline in the 1920s and 1930s. The [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] founded in 1924, was largely a bush and float plane operation. Only in the 1930s did it acquire a modest combat capability with a handful of British [[Armstrong Whitworth Siskin]] fighters and a squadron of [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighters as the clouds of war grew menacing. The [[Royal Canadian Navy]], perpetually starved for equipment acquired its first custom-built ships, the destroyers [[HMCS Saguenay (D79)]] and [[HMCS Skeena (D59)]] on May 22, 1931. In 1929 the army began to retire its horses and was issued four 6-wheeled Leyland tractors in 1929, to tow its 60-pound guns. Four 3-inch 20-cwt. anti-aircraft guns were taken on strength in 1937. As a reflection of this intense and diverse engineering activity, the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers was established in 1936. This organization was renamed [[Engineers Canada]] in 2007.

Canada was involved in the wartime [[Manhattan Project]] to build an atomic bomb, including the [[Montreal Laboratory]] for nuclear research by scientists from Britain, and American contracts with Canadian firms [[Eldorado Gold Mines]] for mining and processing uranium and a heavy water plant built by Consolidated Mining and Smelting (CMS) at [[Trail, British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The years following World War II introduced even more innovations, including television, the transistor radio, synthetic fabrics, plastic, computers, super highways, shopping centres, atomic energy, nuclear weapons, transcontinental energy pipelines, long range electric transmission, transcontinental microwave networks, fast food, chemical fertilizer, insecticides, the birth control pill, jet aircraft, cable TV, colour TV, the instant replay, the audio cartridge and audio cassette, satellite communications and continental air defence systems.

===Communications (television and the transistor radio)===

In the early 1980s Canadian Satellite Communications (Cancom) assembled a package of Canadian and American television channels which it offered to remote communities throughout the northern regions of Canada. The signals were distributed by Anik satellite and made available to the local populace through cable. By the later part of the decade several hundred communities were using this service.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, E. Austin, The Struggle for National Broadcasting in Canada, McClelland &amp; Stewart, Toronto, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also technological innovation in the telephone system. The first trans-Atlantic telephone cable, jointly owned by the Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation, British Post Office and AT&amp;T, was brought into service in 1956, paving the way for telephone calls from Canada to Britain and Europe. An improved cable, CANTAT was installed in 1961. A similar service on the west coast, [[COMPAC]], the [[Commonwealth Pacific Cable System]] was inaugurated in 1963, linking Canada by undersea telephone cable with New Zealand and Australia. CN/CP Telecommunications introduced the well known Telex service to Canada in 1956. Direct distance dialing was initiated in Canada in 1958, beginning with customers in Toronto and on 1 July of that year the [[Trans-Canada Microwave]] system, known as the Trans-Canada Skyway, went into service.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Robert, A Voice from Afar: The History of Telecommunications in Canada, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, 1977, pp. 292–295.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept and operation of a dedicated [[emergency telephone number]] originated in Canada, where the City of Winnipeg established the world's first [[9-1-1]] service in 1959. The service eventually spread and was offered continent wide.

===Communications (satellites)===

The [[Anik (satellite)]] series of communications satellites initially built by Hughes Aircraft and operated by [[Telesat Canada]] starting in 1972 formed the basis of the world's first domestic satellite communications service. Telesat has launched a large number of satellites including, Anik A1 - 1972, Anik A2 - 1973, Anik A3 - 1975, Anik B - 1978, Anik D1 - 1982, Anik C3 - 1982, Anik C2 - 1983, Anik D2 - 1984, Anik C1 - 1985, Anik E2 - 1991, Anik E1 - 1991, MSAT - 1996, Nimiq 1 - 1999, Anik F1 - 2000, Nimiq 2 - 2002, Anik F2 - 2004, Anik F1R - 2005, and Anik F3 - 2007.

"Dataroute", the world's first national digital data system was introduced by CN/CP in 1973.

===Nuclear weapons===
After considerable political turmoil Canada acquired [[nuclear weapons]] from the Americans under a "dual key" arrangement on 1 January 1963. Genie air-to-air rockets armed with atomic warheads were based at RCAF Stations Comox, British Columbia, Bagotville, Quebec, and Chatham, New Brunswick, as the primary weapon for the newly acquired CF-101 interceptor. The nuclear armed [[BOMARC]] (Boeing Michigan Air Research Corporation) anti-aircraft missile was based at RCAF Stations North Bay, Ontario, and Lamacaza, Quebec. In Germany, as part of Canada's NATO commitment, nuclear free-fall bombs were acquired for the RCAF CF-104 strike fighter and the Canadian Army in Germany took possession of a battery of  [[MGR-1 Honest John|Honest John]] surface-to-surface battlefield rockets armed with nuclear warheads. By 1984 all these atomic weapons had been returned to the United States.

While there were no accidents involving nuclear weapons in Canadian hands, there were at least two involving USAF aircraft flying in Canadian airspace. On 14 February 1950 a USAF B-36 heavy bomber, serial 44-92075, carrying one Mark 4 (Fat Man type) atomic bomb experienced multiple engine failures while flying south off the coast of British Columbia and jettisoned the bomb over Squally Channel. The crew bailed out and the plane flew on autopilot for another 330&amp;nbsp;km before crashing on a mountainside in the Kispiox Valley. In eastern Canada on 10 November 1950, a USAF B-50 heavy bomber, serial 46-038, flying from Goose Bay, Labrador, to the United States, experienced engine trouble and in accordance with standard operating procedures, jettisoned the Mark 4 atomic bomb it was carrying over the St. Lawrence River, near Rivière-du-Loup. The bomb's own 2200&amp;nbsp;kg conventional explosives blew it apart before it hit the water. The plane flew on to a base in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Clearwater, John, Canadian Nuclear Weapons: The Untold Story of Canada's Cold War Arsenal, Dundurn, Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computers===
[[Computers]] were introduced in a variety of areas at this time. The [[National Research Council of Canada|National Research Council Canada]] experimented with fire-control computers towards the end of the war. The University of Toronto Computer Centre, established in 1947, developed Canada’s first operational computer the University of Toronto Electronic Computer ([[UTEC]]) in 1951. This was followed by the purchase of FERUT (Ferranti University of Toronto) computer, by the Computer Centre in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Eggleston, Wilfred, National Research in Canada: The NRC 1916–1966, Clarke Irwin, Toronto, 1978, pp 412–418.&lt;/ref&gt; The NRC used this computer in the early fifties for the hydrographic modeling of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] then under construction. Computers were also developed by other organizations, including the National Research Council, the NRC Computer (1954–1960), Ferranti Canada, mail sorter (1955), Computing Devices of Canada, the "Kicksorter" (1957–1963), the Defence Research Board, the DRTE (1960) and Sperry Canada, UMAC-5 (1962). [[Avro Canada]] in Toronto worked unsuccessfully to develop the fire-control computer for the [[Velvet Glove]] air-to-air missile for the highly advanced but ill-fated [[Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow]] interceptor. [[Avro Canada]] made extensive use of computers in calculations for aircraft design and manufacturing processes, including [[Numerical control|CNC]].  Other military developers included the Royal Canadian Navy with its [[DATAR]] system for the command and control of warships.

In the 1950s the Pinetree, Mid-Canada and DEW Line air-defence radar chains built across Canada relied heavily on computers. Certainly the largest and most powerful computer in Canada at the time was the IBM/USAF developed [[AN/FSQ-7]], installed in the late 1950s, {{convert|700|ft|m}} underground at RCAF Station North Bay, as the "brain" of the DEW Line System. The machine contained 55,000 vacuum tubes, weighed 275 tons and occupied a half-acre of floor space. It could perform 75,000 instructions per second.
 
By 1958 there were 41 computers in operation in Canada with big business, universities or the military. The most popular was the [[IBM 650]], which was used by 19 organizations, including Canadair Limited, Canadian General Electric, Ford Motor Company of Canada, Great West Life Assurance Company, Imperial Oil Limited, Orenda Engines Limited and the University of Toronto. Other models in use included the [[Bendix G-15]], 4, the [[ALWAC III-E]], 3, the [[IBM 705]], 3, the [[UNIVAC II]], 3, the [[Datatron|Datatron 205]], 2, the [[LGP-30]], 2, the Borroughs E 101, 1, the [[IBM 704]], 1, and the NRC 102A/D.&lt;ref&gt;Stachniak, Zbigniew, Campbell, Scott C., Computing in Canada, Transformation Series, No. 17, Canada Science and Technology Museum2009, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first commercial users of computers was [[Trans-Canada Airlines]] (TCA). In 1961 Ferranti-Packard developed the [[ReserVec]] computer reservation system for TCA (now [[Air Canada]]). This formed the basis for the [[Ferranti-Packard 6000]] computer, and in 1963 two were sold in Canada, one to the Defence Research Establishment Atlantic, in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia and the other to the Toronto Stock Exchange.

In 1961 the [[Royal Bank of Canada]] was the first bank in Canada to introduce computers for its operations, followed by the [[Toronto-Dominion Bank]] in 1962. It was soon followed by the other large Canadian banks, including the [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce]] and [[Bank of Nova Scotia]]. When they introduced the [[credit card]] about the same time these records were kept on large central computers as well. It was this experience with large computer systems linking hundreds of branch offices across the country that enabled the banks to introduce the [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] and the [[debit card]], across Canada in the 1980s. Computers were also introduced to control complex industrial processes.  Interprovincial Pipe Line Limited of Edmonton was one of the first Canadian companies to employ computers as a means of controlling the flow of gas in its very large pipeline system. [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] used computers to control atomic fission in its power reactors. In 1977 the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] became the first stock market in the world convert to electronic trading with the introduction of the its Computer Assisted Trading System. Twenty years later, in 1997, the exchange closed its trading floor and converted to a fully automated, computer-driven trading system.

Computers were also recognized as a tool for policing. The [[Canadian Police Information Centre]] which was established in 1966 under the auspices of the RCMP, has operated, since that date, a national computer data base that provides information relating to criminal activity in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Police Information Centre www.cpic-cipc.ca/English/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period [[Canada Post]] applied computer readable codes to speed the delivery of mail. On 1 April 1971 the postal code system was introduced. The technique involved the use of a six-character geographic code placed on the envelope or parcel by the sender. The code was in turn machine scanned by a computer-driven optical reader that signaled the sorting equipment to direct the item to the proper destination. While technically effective, the introduction of the system lead to serious labour trouble at Canada Post for several years by unionized workers who were afraid of pay cuts or job loss ([[Postal codes in Canada]]).

===Transportation===
In transportation, several significant works were completed, including the [[Toronto Subway]], 1954, the Trans-Canada Gas Pipeline, 1958, the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]], 1959, [[Trans-Canada Highway]], completed in 1962, the [[Montreal Subway]], 1966, [[GO Transit]], Toronto area, 1967 and [[Highway 401]], Ontario, completed in 1968.

On August 10, 1949, the [[Avro Canada C102 Jetliner]], a mid-range four-engine passenger jet, made its first flight, just 13 days after the world's first and eight years before the US's first, the [[Boeing 707]].  Trans-Canada Airlines (later [[Air Canada]]) and [[Canadian Pacific Airlines]] introduced jet passenger service with the [[de Havilland Comet]], DC-8, DC9, B727 and B-737. The B-747 was introduced by these companies in the early seventies. In the sixties and early seventies De Havilland Aircraft of Canada in Toronto developed the [[DHC-7 Dash 7]] and DHC-8 Dash 8 [[STOL]] aircraft. These were used to provide passenger service to small city centre airports in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal. A number of international carriers also acquired these aircraft to provide similar services elsewhere in the world. The first Canadian owned [[helicopter]] began operation in Canada on 12 March 1947. On that date Photographic Survey Corporation took possession of a Bell Bell 47B-3, registration CF-FJA.&lt;ref&gt;Milberry, Larry, Aviation in Canada, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, Toronto, 1979, p.242.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of trans-oceanic aviation in the postwar years created a need for accurate weather information over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. An international agreement in 1946 established 13 Ocean Weather Stations with Canada being responsible for two, ocean station Baker several hundred miles off the east coast from 1947 to 1950 and for ocean station Papa {{convert|900|mi|km}} off the coast of Vancouver from 1950 to 1981. A number of ships, both converted RCN vessels and purpose built CCG weather ships were stationed at these points to gather weather information during these years. Ships involved included, HMCS St. Stephen, HMCS St. Catherines, HMCS Stone Town, CCGS Vancouver, and CCGS Quadra.

Of note was the transit of the Northwest Passage in 1954 by [[HMCS Labrador]], Canada's first purpose built icebreaker, which was acquired that same year, in service with the Royal Canadian Navy.

Of particular significance was the conversion from steam to diesel by Canada's two great railways. Beginning in the mid fifties the CPR and Canadian National Railways began replacing their steam locomotives with diesel locomotives. By 1960 the conversion was mostly complete.

The [[Volkswagen]] was introduced to Canadians in 1952 and became very popular with drivers who wanted greater fuel economy than that provided by the larger cars then on the market. It was sold in Canada until 1977. The seat belt became a standard feature of domestic passenger cars in the late sixties. The [[catalytic converter]] was also introduced during these years. The first devices, designed to reduce air pollution from automobile exhaust, were installed in the 1975 model year for US cars manufactured in Canada. Because of environmental concerns and the fact that it was not compatible with these converters, the major gasoline companies in Canada began to eliminate the sale of [[leaded gasoline]] that same year.

Although Armand Bombardier invented the [[snowmobile]], the initial production model, the B-7 dating from 1937 was a large 7 passenger vehicle. It was not until 1959 with the development of the small gas engine that the individual snowmobile or Ski-doo was produced by Bombardier ([[Bombardier Recreational Products]]) in the company factory at Valcourt, Quebec. A number of competitors in Canada and elsewhere entered the market and sales of snowmobiles skyrocketed with 2 million being sold worldwide between 1970 and 1973. To this day, snowmobiles remain popular in Canada and other regions with snowy winters.

Pedestrian walkways have become important features of some Canadian cities. Climate controlled underground passageways and shopping malls have been features of the downtown cores of Toronto ([[PATH (Toronto)]]) and Montreal ([[Underground City, Montreal]]) since the mid-sixties. Arguable the most unusual, is the [[Plus 15]] system in downtown Calgary. Initiated in 1970 it presently consists of 57 bridges and 16&amp;nbsp;km of enclosed climate controlled passageways suspended {{convert|15|ft|m}} above ground level which permit pedestrians to walk anywhere in the downtown core summer or winter without ever going outside.

===Atomic energy===
Beginning in the mid-1950s nuclear-generated electricity was developed under a partnership of industry and government at both the federal and provincial levels. A [[NPD reactor|demonstration power reactor, the NPD]] was built at Rolphton, Ontario in 1962, followed by a commercial-scale [[CANDU]] prototype at Douglas Point in 1968.  In 1971 electricity became commercially available from the large (ultimately 8-unit) Pickering station near Toronto, Ontario and, starting in 1977, the Bruce station (ultimately 8-units as well), near Kinkardine, Ontario. These were followed by the Gentilly-2 Atomic Electric Plant, Trois-Rivières, Quebec and the Point Lepreau Atomic Electric Plant, Point Lepreau, New Brunswick both in 1982. The electric current supplied by commercial hydro companies to consumers was changed and organizations like Hydro Ontario converted from 25 cycles to 60 cycles during the ten-year period from 1949 to 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Eggleston, Wilfred, Canada's Nuclear Story, Clarke Irwin, Toronto, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of this technology was not without mishap. On 12 December 1952 the experimental NRX reactor at Chalk River suffered a failure of its cooling system and underwent a partial meltdown. On May 24, 1958, the newly commissioned NRU reactor also a Chalk River experienced a major accident when one of the uranium filled fuel rods caught fire and seriously contaminated the reactor building with radioactive debris.

===Energy (oil and gas)===
The modern era of oil production in Canada began in 1947 when Imperial made its major discovery at Leduc, Alberta. The availability of oil and gas in Alberta, a half continent away from central Canada provided the impetus for the construction of two huge transcontinental pipelines to the eastern Canadian market. The crude oil pipeline was the first to be built. The construction of first section of the Interprovincial Pipeline from Edmonton to Regina to Superior Wisconsin in the US began in 1950 and was completed in an astonishing 150 days. In 1953 the pipeline was extended through the US to Sarnia, Ontario and from Sarnia to Toronto in 1957. At the time of its completion it was the longest pipeline in the world. The oil and gasoline industry has grown tremendously since then, mainly to meet the demand for gasoline created by the popularity of the car and for home heating oil. Major [[oil refineries]] have been built in Vancouver, British Columbia, Edmonton, Alberta, Sarnia, Ontario, Montreal, Quebec and Saint John, New Brunswick.

The construction of the transcontinental oil pipeline was followed by that of the gas carrying Trans-Canada pipeline. Work began in 1956 at the Alberta/Saskatchewan border advancing to Regina, Winnipeg and Port Arthur, Ontario in 1957. Construction was not without mishap as during a pressure test in 1957 five kilometres of pipe blew up near Dryden, Ontario. The line crossed the very technically difficult Canadian Shield north of Lake Superior and reached Toronto and Montreal in 1958.  At the time of its completion it was the longest pipeline in the world. Political controversies related to the construction of the pipeline contributed to the fall of the St. Laurent Liberal government in 1957. 
Gas pipelines were also built in Alberta, the largest being that of Alberta Gas Trunk Lines, incorporated in 1954 and British Columbia, where the [[Westcoast Transmission Co.]] system was completed in 1957. While large pipelines carried natural gas across the continent smaller distribution systems were necessary to carry gas into factories and individual homes, where it was used as a source of heat. Very complex local understreet pipeline networks were constructed in cities across Canada to meet this requirement.

Other energy projects of the period included  the Lakeview Generating Station, Mississauga, Ontario, 1962, the W.A.C.Bennett (hydro) Dam, British Columbia, 1967, the Gardiner (hydro) Dam, Saskatchewan, 1968, the Churchill Falls Hydro Dam, Labrador, 1971, the [[Nanticoke Generating Station]] (largest coal-fired plant in North America), Nanticoke, Ontario, 1978 and La Grande 2 Hydro Dam, Quebec, 1979. The energy crisis of 1973 had domestic repercussions with many consumers taking steps to reduce energy costs through the installation of improved home insulation and wood burning stoves.

The existence in Alberta of large quantities of surface bitumen (oil) mixed with sand has been known for many years. In the late 1970s the commercial production of [[synthetic crude]] oil from this bitumen began near Fort McMurray. Construction at this site, by a company known as [[Syncrude]], began in 1973 and the first crude oil was produced there in 1978. The complex and costly production process involves scraping the sticky bitumen-laden sand from the surface, transporting it to a processing facility, removing the sand from the bitumen and upgrading the bitumen to a product known as light sweet crude. The technical scale of the operation is very large. Initially the sandy tar-like bitumen was scrapped from the ground using gigantic powered rotating mechanical wheels equipped with scraping buckets and the [[oil sand]] was placed on conveyor belts for transport to the processing plant. However, the severely cold Albert winters caused the continuous breakdown of the machinery and a new technique was developed. This involves the use of gigantic power shovels and dumptrucks to deliver the bitumen laden sand to the processing plant. Once at the plant the bitumen is removed from the sand with a process that involves the use of hot water. The bitumen is then subjected to fluid coking, [[hydroprocessing]], hydrotreating and reblending. Syncrude is the largest producer of synthetic crude oil from bitumen sand in the world and the largest producer of oil from a single site in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Web site, Canadian Oil Sands Trust, Annual Report, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry===
The forestry industry underwent a notable process of mechanization in the postwar years. The most visible change was the introduction of the [[chain saw]]. When originally developed for modern use in the 1920s, this heavy, gasoline engine-driven machine required two men for its operation. However, improvements in engine technology eventually made the saw small and light enough to be operated easily by one person. In 1944 one of the first industrial users, [[Bloedel, Stewart and Welch|Bloedel Stewart and Welch Ltd]]. in British Columbia had 112 chain saws in operation, but their use accounted for only a small part of total forestry tree cutting. In 1950 less than one percent of pulpwood in Canada was cut with chain saws. However, by 1955 this figure had grown to more than 50%.

Other machines were also introduced during this period. The first [[feller buncher]] was used by the Quebec North Shore Paper Company in 1957. Hydraulic tree shears were first used in 1966 by the Abitibi Pulp and Paper Company Limited ([[Abitibi-Consolidated]]). Snowmobiles and tracked machines replaced animals for the hauling of logs. In 1948 several Bombardier machines were employed to this end by the Ste. Anne Power Company Limited in Quebec. In 1959 Timberland Machines of Woodstock, Ontario developed the Timberbuncher, a self-propelled machine which could move through the forest, cut a whole tree at its base (a process known as full tree harvesting) and, using a hydraulic arm, place it into a pile for hauling. Machines that stripped the branches from felled trees, a process known as delimbing, were also introduced at this time.

With the help of these technologies, the Canadian [[pulp and paper industry]] grew to become one of the major suppliers of newsprint in the world through the operations of companies such as [[MacMillan Bloedel Limited]], Repap Enterprises Inc., Kruger Inc., Great Lakes Forest Products Ltd, [[British Columbia Forest Products|British Columbia Forest Products Ltd.]], Consolidated-Bathurst Inc., [[Canadian Forest Products|Canadian Forest Products Ltd.]], CIP Inc., Domtar Pulp &amp; Paper Products Group and Abitibi Consolidated.

The use of [[pesticides]] was a prominent feature of postwar agriculture across Canada. Insecticides based on fluorine, arsenic, rotenone, nicotine pyrethrum as well as herbicides using sulphiric acid, arsenites and salt and finally fungicides based on sulphur, mercury or copper have been very effective in controlling life forms that degrade agricultural output. At the same time these compounds have also had a negative effect beyond their intended sphere of use. [[DDT]] was registered for use in Canada from 1946 until 1985, when its use was banned. The product was never manufactured in Canada. [[Food irradiation]], in particular the irradiation of potatoes to prevent sprouting while in storage, was approved for use in Canada in 1960.

Potash-based [[chemical fertilizer]] became an important element of increased agricultural production in Canada and around the world in the postwar era. In Saskatchewan techniques were introduced for the mining of the huge potash deposits found there. These involve both "dry" and "wet", methods of mining. The dry method involves the sinking of a vertical shaft and the use of large powered cutting machines to cut into the potash horizontally. The wet technique known as solution mining is used to access potash at greater depths. This involves drilling a vertical hole into the deposit into which is pumped hot water. The liquid dissolves the potash underground and then returns to the surface, where another process separates the mineral from the water.&lt;ref&gt;web site, Western Potash Corp. www.westernpotash.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Office automation===
Business administration underwent technological change. The [[ball point pen]] was marketed in the US in October 1945 and in Canada shortly thereafter. The [[IBM Selectric typewriter]], introduced in 1961, quickly became popular with businesses in Canada, as did the [[Xerox]] photocopier in the 1960s.

===Medicine===
There was important progress in medical technology during this period. In 1945 Dr. Stuart Stanbury established a National Blood Transfusion Programme for the [[Canadian Red Cross Society]], thus making available to those in need, a dependable source of blood for medical purposes. The associated test for blood typing was introduced at the same time. Blood tests would become increasingly sophisticated in the coming years. The [[electroencephalograph]], used for the diagnosis of neurological disorders was introduced in major Canadian medical institutions in the late forties.

The techniques for the mass production and distribution of vaccines and for the mass public inoculation were introduced during these years. Polio was a disease that affected large numbers of Canadian children during the first part of the 20th century. In the US, research by Dr. Jonas Salk in the late 1940s led to the discovery of vaccine for the prevention of this disease. However, there was no technique for volume manufacture of the drug. Connaught Laboratories of Toronto developed a synthetic culture known as "medium 199", which enabled the mass production of this [[polio vaccine]] beginning in 1952. A successful all-Canadian mass inoculation of children using the new vaccine was undertaken in the spring of 1955, the first such mass public health campaign of its type in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Rutty, Christopher J., Connaught and the Canadian Polio Vaccine Story, CONNTACT, Vol. 9, No. 3 June 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antibiotics]] such as penicillin were quickly made available to the general public in the postwar years.

There was also progress with respect to the treatment of heart disease. The [[pacemaker]] invented with significant Canadian participation was used to treat patients with arrhythmia. For more serious problems [[open heart surgery]] became an option for patients and permitted the repair of faulty heart valves, the clearing of blocked coronary arteries and the resolution of other problems. Canada's first [[heart transplant]] was performed on 31 May 1968, by Dr. Pierre Godin the Chief Surgeon at the Montreal Heart Institute, on patient Albert Murphy of Chomedy, Quebec a 59-year-old retired butcher suffering from degenerative heart disease. The operation took place about six months after the world's first, by Dr. Christian Barnard.&lt;ref&gt;Web site, CBC Digital Archives, www.archives.cbc.ca/on_this_day/05/31/.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neurosurgery]] was introduced in a substantive way in the 1960s.

Cancer patients were provided with a new option, [[radiation therapy]], through what was popularly known as the "Cobalt Bomb", again developed with important Canadian input. The use of [[radio isotopes]] for diagnostics was also introduced. [[Chemotherapy]] also became a treatment option. In 1960 the use of a subcutaneous arteriovenous shunt along with the artificial kidney machine allowed [[hemodialysis]] for patients with chronic renal failure.

During these years the Montreal Neurological Institute pioneered the development of medical imaging technologies introducing Canada's first [[Computed axial tomography|CAT]] scan in 1973, [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scan in 1975 and [[MRI]] in 1982. The technique of [[medical ultrasonography]] also became widely available beginning in the late 1960s and was especially popular with expectant mothers interested in the health and sex of their fetus. The number of these machines in use has grown greatly over the years. In 2004 there were about 150 MRI units and about 350 CAT units in use in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Press Release CIHI, "CIHI report shows increase in MRI and CT scanners, up more than 75% in the last decade." Medical Imaging in Canada, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The corneal [[contact lenses]] first developed in 1949 gained mass appeal in Canada and elsewhere in the 1960s. Made of [[polymethyl methacrylate]] (PMMA) they could be worn up to 16 hours a day.

Developments in [[orthodontics]] made the straightening of the teeth of children with "braces" commonplace. Children were also often on the receiving end of the tonsillectomy a fashionable surgical procedure during these years.

The surgical replacement of body parts also became possible and was used to treat ailing kidneys and joints such as knees and hips. The availability of cosmetic implants became popular during these years. In 1962, in the US, Dow Corning developed the silicone gel-filled [[breast implant]] which was used by women for surgical breast augmentation. The procedure was common in Canada. In recent years implants containing saline solution have also become popular.

Pharmaceuticals attained a high-profile. The availability of the [[birth control pill]] in 1960 made it possible for women to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy. Stress could be treated with [[tranquilizers]], such as valium, introduced in 1963. The consumption of [[vitamins]]  became widespread and supplements were added to staple foods such as milk and bread and were taken in pill form. While most of these drugs were safe, one, [[thalidomide]], had horrific consequences for its users. Thalidomide was invented in West Germany in 1954 by Chemie Grunenthal as a sedative. It was noted that the drug was particularly effective in treating the symptoms of morning sickness associated with pregnancy. The drug was made available under prescription to Canadians beginning 1 April 1961. Tragically it was discovered that the drug caused miscarriage and severe birth defects.  As a result, the drug was withdrawn from the Canadian market on 2 March 1962.&lt;ref&gt;web site, www.thalidomide.ca, Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada,&lt;/ref&gt;

The "recreational" use of "soft drugs" such a [[marijuana]], [[LSD]] and [[hashish]] became part of the 1960s counter culture.  Marijuana was often produced locally using the hydroponic method.

===Domestic and consumer technology (in the home)===
The car, cheap gasoline and postwar affluence created boom conditions for the expansion of [[suburbia]]. Several standard designs for the single family home on a standard lot were reproduced cookie-cutter style row-upon-row in cities across Canada as subdivision after subdivision sprang up radiating from the central core. The designs were thoroughly modern, reflecting the optimism of the era, usually with a peaked roof, asphalt shingles and a brick or wood siding exterior and included a living room, kitchen and occasionally dining room and two, three or four bedrooms and a full basement made of poured concrete or cinder block. Floors were usually made of varnished hardwood planks and the walls and ceilings of gyprock. Copper piping brought running water from the serviced street and copper wiring electricity from the rear lot line. Clay tile pipe carried the sewage from the flush, sit toilet to the main sewer line running under the street. There was usually a driveway beside the house for the family car, and less frequently a carport or garage.

Most homes were equipped with a telephone often with a "party" line but these became rare by the 1960s. A television set was also common in almost all homes by the end of the 1950s and the record player gave way to the hi-fi stereo. Almost all kitchens were equipped with electric refrigerators and electric or less commonly gas, stoves.  Where there was gas it was usually piped to the home through a main line running under the street. There were a variety of electrical "labour saving" devices including electrical mixers can openers and carving knives. Central heating was a standard feature and coal, delivered to the home by a diesel powered truck, was the dominant fuel source in the early postwar years. However, as the 1950s progressed coal gave way to oil and gas heating. Home furnishings were almost all mass-produced and made from wood, fabric and various types of stuffing for cushions. In the kitchen metal chrome tube chairs and formica topped tables were popular. The small front and back yard were maintained with the help of a gasoline-powered lawn mower, and the hedge and bushes were trimmed with electric clippers. In the early 1960s the high-rise apartment building began to make its appearance in large cities. The self-supporting steel structures were usually seven stories or more, and large buildings contained hundreds of dwelling units. Initially they were especially visible along Highway 401 in Toronto, Metropolitan Boulevard in Montreal and the north shore of English Bay in Vancouver. Their construction was possible due to the introduction of the high-rise crane, which to this day remains a common feature of city skylines.

The arrival of television had an effect on eating habits. In 1953, C.A. Swanson &amp; Sons introduced the [[TV dinner]] to the US market. The pre-cooked food items, including, meat, potatoes and a vegetable were placed in the segments of an aluminum tray and frozen. The consumer purchased the frozen product and heated it in the oven for about 25 minutes. It could be eaten out of the tray.  In 1960, Swanson, a subsidiary of the Campbell Soup Company, built a factory in Listowel, Ontario to manufacture TV dinners and other Campbell frozen products for the Canadian market. The [[electric toothbrush]] introduced in 1959 has become very popular in Canada since the 1990s.

The steel [[aerosol spray]] can with the gas propellant, and "crimp on nozzle" was developed in the US in 1949. It quickly became a favored type of packaging in Canada for a number of products including whipped cream, deodorant, bug spray and hair spray. The gas propellant, usually a [[chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC), became a target for environmental concern in the 1970s when research demonstrated that it had a harmful effect on the ozone layer in the atmosphere. The international [[Montreal Protocol]] of 1989 banned the use of these substances and they were subsequently replaced with volatile [[hydrocarbons]]. The disposable [[diaper]] was introduced to the Canadian market in 1972 by [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] Canada Ltd. The chemistry of hair colouring was introduced to the domestic scene in the US and Canada in 1956, when [[Clairol]] began marketing a home hair colouring kit for women that could be purchased for a modest price at a local pharmacy or grocery store. Invented in Canada, the green plastic garbage bag ([[Bin bag]]) was introduced to Canadians in the late 1960s. Patented in 1955 by Swiss engineer, [[George de Mestral]], [[velcro]], a two sided fastening technology based on hooks and loops, was introduced to a number of countries, including Canada, in the late 1950s. In Montreal, Velek Ltd. acquired the exclusive marketing rights for velcro in North and South America and Japan.

The format for sound recordings changed in the years just following the war. In the US, [[Columbia Records]] introduced the long playing (LP) 33{{frac|1|3}} format in 1948. Columbia made an agreement with [[Sparton Records]], of London, Ontario, established in 1930, for the manufacture and distribution of its LP records in Canada. Not to be caught short, [[RCA Victor]] in the US responded in 1949 with its own technological innovation the 45 rpm record (with the big hole in the centre) and manufactured and distributed this new format for the Canadian market through its Canadian subsidiary, RCA Victor of Canada, established in Montreal in 1929. The video home system ([[VHS]]) released in 1976 by [[Victor Company of Japan, Limited]] (JVC), quickly became popular in Canada and was used to record TV programmes or to play VHS tapes of Hollywood movies that could be rented in neighborhood video stores that soon became a common feature of suburban strip malls. In 2003 the popularity of DVD surpassed VHS and by 2006 the technology had become obsolete.

The introduction of the [[credit card]] complimented the appearance of the shopping mall. In 1968 a number of Canadian banks including the Bank of Nova Scotia, the Royal Bank of Canada, the Toronto-Dominion Bank and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce began issuing the [[Chargex]] credit card to customers. In 1977 these cards were reissued by the same banks under the [[VISA]] brand name. The [[MasterCard]] credit card became available to Canadians in 1973.

===Domestic and consumer technology (in the Suburbs)===

The booming growth of the suburbs led to the appearance of the [[shopping mall]], a low-rise steel frame, commercial structure housing a number of retail outlets and surrounded by acres of asphalt parking lot for large numbers of cars. The first in Canada included the Norgate Shopping Centre, Saint-Laurent, Quebec, 1949, the Dorval Shopping Centre, Dorval, Quebec, 1950, the Park Royal Shopping Centre, West Vancouver, British Columbia, 1950, the Sunnybrook Plaza, Toronto, 1951 and York Mills, Toronto, 1952.

The hospitality industry was similarly affected and [[fast food]] drive-in restaurants began to appear. In 1951 the first St. Hubert BBQ restaurant opened its doors on St-Hubert street in Montreal. A&amp;W opened its first Canadian operation in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1957. In 1959 [[Harvey's]] opened its first eatery on Yonge Street in Richmond Hill. In Hamilton, Ontario, the  first [[Tim Hortons]] restaurant opened in 1964. The first McDonald's restaurant outside the United States was opened in Richmond, British Columbia in 1967 and Pizza Delight was founded in Shediac, New Brunswick, in 1968.

Cinema attendance boomed after the war and with it innovations in cinema design. The first double-screen cinema, The Elgin, opened its doors in Ottawa in 1946 and the [[drive-in cinema]] became popular after the war. However, the long cold Canadian winters discouraged the widespread diffusion of this type of film exhibition. The dramatic [[IMAX]] large-scale cinema format was invented as the result of developments in cinematic technology during Expo '67 in Montreal. The world's first permanent Imax cinema, Cinesphere, was built at [[Ontario Place (theme park)|Ontario Place]] in Toronto in 1971. Others were built in Vancouver for Expo '86 and at the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] in Gatineau, Quebec, in 1989. By 1995 there were 129 Imax cinemas entertaining audiences around the world. The audio cartridge and audio cassette became popular in the early 1970s with the cassette eventually winning the battle of the formats. This compact medium led to the appearance of high quality in-car sound systems.

The New [[Woodbine Racetrack]] for thoroughbred horse racing opened to the public in Toronto in 1956 (simply Woodbine after 1963) replacing the original Woodbine which was built in 1874. Canada’s first purpose-built auto racing track, the [[Westwood Motorsport Park]] was built in Coquitlam, British Columbia in 1959. The [[Mosport International Raceway]], north of Bowmanville, Ontario opened to the public in 1961 and hosted the Canadian Grand Prix Formula 1 races from 1967 to 1977. [[La Ronde (amusement park)|La Ronde]] became Canada’s largest amusement park when it opened in 1967 as part of [[Expo '67]] in Montreal. It is popular to this day for a number of roller coasters, including The Boomerang, [[Cobra (La Ronde)|Cobra]], [[Goliath (La Ronde)|Goliath]], [[Le Monstre]] and [[Vampire (La Ronde)|Vampire]].

===Materials===
[[Detergent]], a replacement for soap, introduced in the postwar years, was used to keep clothes and dishes clean through the action of its active ingredient, tetrapropylene, a derivative of petroleum. The popular Tide brand became available in 1948. In 1964 [[permanent press]] fabrics were invented in the US by Ruth Rogan Benerito, a scientist at the Physical Chemistry Research Group of the Cotton Chemical Reactions Laboratory and introduced to Canada shortly thereafter. The press resulted from the treatment of the fabric with formaldehyde. Invented by DuPont scientist Dr. Roy J. Plunkett in 1938,  [[polytetrafluoroethylene]], a polymer considered the world’s most slippery substance, was introduced commercially as [[Teflon]], in 1946 in the US. It is used in a wide variety of applications, including as a non-stick coating on the cooking surface of pots and pans and is manufactured in Canada by DuPont in Mississauga, Ontario. Krazy Glue ([[ethyl cyanoacrylate]]) was introduced to Canada in 1973.

===Waste disposal and sewage treatment===
In the postwar years Canadian municipalities began treating raw sewage, which up to that time, with a few notable exceptions, had been allowed to flow directly from their sewer systems into nearby streams, rivers, lakes and oceans. New facilities were added in Toronto including the Highland Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1956 and the Humber Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1960. Vancouver built a number of sewage treatment facilities including the Lions Gate Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1961, the Iona Island Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1963 and the Lulu Island Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1973. The City of Ottawa built the Green's Creek Pollution Control Center (now Robert O. Pickard Environmental Centre) in 1961. In 1970 the City of Montreal began the construction of a large sewer network which channeled all effluent to the treatment plant at Rivière-des-Prairies on the east end of the island and became operational in 1996. By 1980, 64% of Canadians were served by sewage treatment, with the figure rising to 78% in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Web site, OECD, www.environmentalindicators.com/htdocs/indicators/7muni.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Public and industrial concern with air pollution and [[acid rain]] led to measures being taken by a number of companies to cut back on harmful atmospheric emissions. In 1972, [[Vale Inco|Inco]] undertook steps to reduce emissions of SO2 and other gases by installing scrubbers and a {{convert|1250|ft|m|adj=on}} chimney at its Copper Cliff smelter in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;Web site, Vale Inco, www.inco.com/business/history/#&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public works and civil engineering ===

Bridges of note included the [[Angus L. Macdonald Bridge]] in Halifax 1954, the [[Oak Street Bridge]], Vancouver, 1957, the [[Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway]], 1958, [[Ogdensburg-Prescott International Bridge]], 1960, the [[Queensborough Bridge]], Vancouver 1960, the [[Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge]], Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, 1962, the [[Champlain Bridge, Montreal]], 1962, the [[Lewiston-Queenston Bridge]], Niagara Falls, Ontario, 1962, the [[Port Mann Bridge]], Vancouver, 1964, the [[Macdonald-Cartier Bridge]], Ottawa, 1965, the [[Pont de la Concorde (Montreal)]], 1966, the [[Prince Edward Viaduct]], Toronto 1966, the [[Laviolette Bridge]], Trois-Rivières, Quebec, 1967, the [[Saint John Harbour Bridge]], Saint John, New Brunswick, 1968, the [[Dinsmore Bridge]], Vancouver, 1969, the [[A. Murray McKay Bridge]], Halifax, 1970, the [[Pierre Laporte Bridge]], Quebec City, 1970, the [[Portage Bridge]], Ottawa, 1973 and the [[Arthur Laing Bridge]], Vancouver, 1976.

This was also an era of gigantism, and there were both successes and failures. Beginning in 1963, massive civil engineering works were undertaken in the St. Lawrence River in Montreal to build the site for the 1967 World's Fair, known as [[Expo 67]].  The gigantic [[Red River Floodway]], which opened in 1968, was designed to carry flood water from a rising Red River around the heart of the City of Winnipeg. It was completed in 1968 and proved successful when used for the first time in 1969. At the time of its completion it was the second largest earth-moving project in the world, after the Panama Canal.

Northwest of Montreal thousands of acres of fertile farmland were expropriated to build the huge new [[Mirabel International Airport]], which opened in 1975. The facility was to be linked to the heart of Montreal with a fast train. The train was never built and both passengers and air carriers stayed away in droves. The site eventually became a quiet industrial airport, home to the production facilities for Bombardier regional jets. On the other hand, the [[James Bay Project]] undertaken in Quebec at the same time was a booming success. Several large dams on the La Grande River with their associated long distance transmission lines provide Hydro-Québec with an important source of electricity.

The [[CN Tower]], the world's tallest free-standing structure, was constructed in Toronto in 1975.

===Architecture===

Important skyscrapers, including [[Place Ville Marie]] (Royal Bank), Montreal, 1962, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Tower, Montreal, 1962, the Edifice Trust Royal (C.I.L. House), Montreal, 1962, the Toronto Dominion Bank Tower, Toronto, 1967, The Simpson Tower, Toronto, 1968, the Hôtel Château Champlain, Montreal, 1967, the Royal Trust Tower, Toronto, 1969, Royal Centre, Vancouver, 1972, [[Inco Superstack]], Sudbury, Ontario, 1972, [[First Canadian Place]], Toronto, 1975, Harbour Centre,  Vancouver, 1976, the Complexe Desjardins, la Tour du Sud, Montreal, 1976, the Scotia Tower, Calgary, 1976, the Scotia Tower, Vancouver, 1977, Royal Bank Plaza, South Tower, Toronto, 1977 and the First Bank Tower, Toronto, 1979, represented significant architectural achievements during this period.

The massive [[Saint Joseph's Oratory]], the largest church in Canada, the construction of which began in 1924, was completed in 1967 on the north slope of Mont Royal in Montreal.

Notable large sports facilities included, Empire Stadium, Vancouver, 1954, [[McMahon Stadium]], Calgary, Alberta, 1960, the Montreal Automobile Stadium (Autostad) 1966, the [[Olympic Stadium]], Montreal, 1976 and [[Commonwealth Stadium (Edmonton)]], 1978.

== The PC Age (1980–2000) ==

[[Microelectronics]] became a part of everyday life during this period. The [[personal computer]] became a feature of most homes, and the microchip found its way into a bewildering variety of products from cars to washing machines.

===The microchip and digital computing===
In 1977 the first commercially produced personal computers were invented in the US: the Apple II, the PET 2001 and the TRS-80. They were quickly made available in Canada. In 1980 IBM introduced the IBM PC. Microsoft provided the operating system, through IBM, where it was referred to as PC&amp;nbsp;DOS and as a stand-alone product known as MS-DOS. This created a rivalry for personal computer operating systems, Apple and Microsoft, which endures to this day. A large variety of special-use software and applications have been developed for use with these operating systems. There have also been a multiplicity of hardware manufacturers which have produced a wide variety of personal computers, and the heart of these machines, the central processing unit, has increased in speed and capacity by leaps and bounds. There were 1,560,000 [[personal computers]] in Canada by 1987, of which 650,000 were in homes, 610,000 in businesses and 300,000 in educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;web site, The Canadian Encyclopedia, www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com, Computer Industry&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian producers of micro-computers included Sidus Systems, 3D Microcomputers, Seanix Technology and [[MDG Computers]]. Of note is the fact that these machines were based on digital technology, and their widespread and rapid introduction to Canada at the same time that the telephone system was undergoing a similar transformation would herald an era of rapid technological advance in the field of communication and computing.

The [[laptop computer]] also appeared during these years and achieved notable popularity in Canada beginning in the 1990s. In 1981 the first commercially available portable computer, the [[Osborne 1]], became available. Other models followed, including the [[Kaypro II]] in 1982, the popular [[Compaq Portable]] and Tandy Corporation [[TRS-80 Model 100]] both in 1983, the IBM PC Convertible, 1986, the [[Macintosh Portable]], 1989 and Power Book, 1991. The latter models in particular were popular with both professionals and consumers.

In the 1970s and 1980s [[word processing]], a method for "typing" documents using a keyboard linked to a computer and a video screen, was developed. Early machines were dedicated exclusively to this function and a notable Canadian contribution, the Superplus IV, produced by AES Data in Montreal in 1981, became widely popular. However, the rise of the personal computer and the invention of PC-compatible word processing software, such as [[WordPerfect]] in 1982 and [[Microsoft Word]] in 1983, made stand-alone word processors obsolete. [[Spreadsheet]] software also became popular for accounting purposes, notably [[Microsoft Excel]], which was also introduced to the world and Canadian market in 1983. These new machines with their new software quickly dominated the market and became an almost universal feature of any Canadian office.

===Supercomputers===

In 1987 there were considerable numbers of larger computers in Canada, including 25,000 mainframe and mini-computers. But the most powerful of all were the [[supercomputers]]. The [[Meteorological Service of Canada]] has been a noted user of large computers and has pioneered the Canadian use of supercomputers. Machines used have included the Bendix G20, 1962, an IBM 360-95 scientific mainframe computer, 1967, its first supercomputer a CDC 7600 from Control Data Corporation, 1973, a Cray 1S supercomputer, 1983, a NEC supercomputer, 1993 and an IBM supercomputer in 2003. At the time of its installation this latter machine was the most powerful computer in Canada.

The Communications Security Establishment (CSE), Canada's "electronic spy" agency has been a notable user of supercomputers. CSE code breaking capabilities degraded substantially in the 1960s and 1970s but were upgraded with the acquisition of a  Cray X-MP/11 (modified) supercomputer delivered to the Sir Leonard Tilley Building in Ottawa, in March 1985. It was, at the time, the most powerful computer in Canada. In the early 1990s, the Establishment purchased a  Floating Point Systems FPS 522-EA supercomputer at a cost of $1,620,371. This machine was upgraded to a Cray S-MP superserver after Cray acquired Floating Point Systems in December 1991 and used the Folklore Operating System supplied by the NSA in the US.&lt;ref&gt;http://luxexumbra.blogspot.com/2008_06_01_archive.html&lt;/ref&gt; These machines are now retired. 
Little information is available on the types of computers used by the CSEC since then. However, Cray in the US has produced a number of improved supercomputers since then. These include the Cray SX-6, early 2000s, the [[Cray X1]], 2003 (development funded in part by the NSA), [[Cray XD1]], 2004, Cray XT3, [[Cray XT4]], 2006, Cray XMt, 2006 and Cray CX1, 2008. It is possible that some of these models have been used by the CSEC and are in use today.

In 2008, Canada’s most powerful research computer, an IBM supercomputer, was installed in Toronto. The $20 million machine, about the size of an SUV, can make 12.5 trillion computations per second and will be used for [[proteomics]] research by the Ontario Cancer Institute, the Princess Margaret Hospital (specializing in cancer) and the University Health Network. An IBM System x iData Plex supercomputer began operation at the University of Toronto in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Omar el Akkad, Monster Computer Roars to Life, The Globe and Mail, 18 June 2009, p. A1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the supercomputer used by Environment Canada for weather forecasting remains the largest in Canada.

===Communications: digitization and fibre optics===
Canada's major telephone companies introduced [[digital technology]] and [[fibre optics]] during this period paving the way for more advanced business and customer telecommunications services.

In 1976 Nortel developed the first digital [[private branch exchange]] (PBX) in the world. That same year Nortel announced its "Digital World" project, which foresaw the development and market introduction of a complete family of digital switching, transmission and business communications systems.

In 1977 Bell Canada began to conduct a fibre optic field trial to residential customers in Montreal. The Manitoba Telephone System began to introduce fibre optics in that province beginning with customers in Elie, in 1981. In 1984 Sasktel, the provincially owned telephone company in Saskatchewan, completed the construction of a 3,268&amp;nbsp;km. long commercial fibre optics network to fifty-two communities in that province. In 1984 CNCP Telecommunications began the construction of a trans-Canada fibre optic network. By 2009, the national fibre optic system in Canada stretched 7000 kilometers across the country and included underwater fibre links to PEI (1985) and Newfoundland. Eight fibres are reserved for Trans-Canada traffic.

On 1 July 1985, Cantel and Bell Cellular began to offer cell phone service in Canada. They used a technical standard known as [[CDMA]], which was compatible with mobile phone systems in the US but not elsewhere in the world. The [[fax]] began to make its presence felt in offices across Canada in the early 1980s.

The ''Globe and Mail'' began to produce its contents in electronic form in 1979. A year later in 1980, in order to enable the daily distribution of the Toronto-based paper across the country, in a bid to become Canada's "national newspaper", it began the transmission of its contents via Anik Satellite to regional offices, where it was printed and distributed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globelink.ca/about/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bluetooth]] technology, developed in 1994 by Ericsson, was introduced to Canadian consumers at that time. The technique permits the very short range radio communication of Bluetooth equipped electronic devices with each other for the purposes of information transfer. It is designed to eliminate the need for wires and cables to connect such machines.

===Lasers===

The use of [[lasers]] became common throughout Canada during these years. The devices are usually found as components of larger systems.

Lasers are used in the field of telecommunications, where they are act as the modulated light sources for fibre optic systems. The high frequency of the pulsed beams of light they produce enables the transmission of large quantities of information and the absence of an electromagnetic field around the fiber optic cable lessens transmission loss and increases the security of the data. Lasers are also used in many mechanical manufacturing systems to start and stop processes, measure component size and monitor and maintain quality.

In public they are commonly found at the retail checkout counter, where they scan bar codes. They are also used to open and close doors for people and cars and are common in public washrooms, where they control the flow of water for taps and the flushing of urinals and toilettes.

Their use in medicine has been growing. They are used to "burn" plaque from clogged arteries, to remove the decayed portion of teeth in dental treatment and to treat vision problems related to retinal detachment and near sightedness ([[lasik surgery]]).

The [[Lidar]], a laser-based instrument, is used by meteorologists to determine the height of the cloud base.

===Transportation===
Smaller vehicles became popular in response to the oil crisis of 1973. In 1981 the [[Chrysler K platform]] introduced by that company formed the basis for the compact K-car. [[Front wheel drive]] was widely introduced to North America by the Big Three US automakers beginning in 1978, when the Plymouth Horizon and Dodge Omni, both with transverse mounted engines, became available. A wide variety of front wheel-drive-models were quickly offered to Canadians by other car makers. 
The [[air bag]] safety feature was introduced during these years. In the US, the 1973 model Oldsmobile Toronado was the first passenger car equipped with an air bag. Ford introduced air bags as an option in the Tempo in the US in 1984 and Crysler made them a standard feature in 1988. Air bags were made available in the Canadian market as this feature became available in US models.

The [[semi-trailer truck]] (18 wheeler), became the dominant vehicle on the heavily used [[Highway 401 (Ontario)]]. [[Containerization]], which had made headway in ocean shipping with the construction of terminals in Halifax, Montreal and Vancouver also led to the eventual elimination of the railway box car and began to make inroads in the trucking industry. [[Light rail]] systems were built in Edmonton, Alberta in 1978, Calgary, Alberta, in 1981 and Vancouver, British Columbia in 1986.

The [[Ontario Highway 407]] Express Toll Road (ETR), opened in Toronto in 1997 to ease the burden of traffic on Highway 401 which passes through the heart of the city to the south. Special technology is used to collect tolls without the use to toll booths. Regular users can equip their cars with a transponder that sends a signal to highway sensors when the vehicle enters and leaves the road. For those vehicles without a transponder, special electro-optical sensors read the number plate and a bill for the toll is sent to the vehicle owner in the mail.

In 1996 GM Canada introduced the [[OnStar]] service to Canadian and US customers who chose this option when purchasing a new car. Considered a safety feature, the service provides emergency services, vehicle diagnostics and directions to drivers on the road. It is based on GPS technology as well as [[CDMA]] mobile phone technology provided in Canada by Bell Mobility. There is a 24-hour emergency response centre in Oshawa for vehicles located in Canada.

In the 1990s, a national weather radar surveillance system for aviation and general use was established. The initial system, the [[Canadian weather radar network]], established by Environment Canada, became operational in 1997 and consisted of 18 weather radars using the 5 centimetre wavelength (C-Band) and one using the ten-centimeter wavelength (S-Band). In 1998 that organization received approval to add another 12 radars and to upgrade the system to the [[Pulse-Doppler radar]] standard.

Also in 1997 the responsibility for air traffic control in Canada was transferred from Transport Canada to [[Nav Canada]]. The very large and complex control system operated by that organization uses a number of technologies, including 1400 ground-based navigation aids, 46 radars and six [[Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast]] systems, which are based on global positioning technology.

Technological improvements have also enhanced rail safety during these years. These include a large number of incremental changes to elements of rolling stock including wheels, axles, trucks, couplers and brakes. There have also been improvements to tracks including continuous weld, concrete sleepers and switching techniques. Techniques of traffic control and communication have also been improved.&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Technologies, Transport Canada, Rail Safety Act Review Secretariat, July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry===
Bombardier's invention of a new class of aircraft, the [[regional jet]] or RJ, allowed airlines to introduce jet passenger service to smaller centres. The design of this machine was facilitated through the use of [[computer-aided design]] software. In 2009, Bombardier Aerospace of Montreal, in cooperation with the [[National Research Council of Canada|National Research Council Canada]] began using robots for the assembly of its aircraft.

[[Factory farming]] of pigs and chickens in particular became a prominent feature of agriculture during these years. Large numbers of these animals are crowded into very large barns with controlled environments in an effort to maximize their growth and hence profit for the farmer. The use of antibiotics to fight infection, as well as the use of growth hormones is common. The growth in the number of these farms has been dramatic. The Fraser Valley in British Columbia is home to the highest concentration of such farms in Canada and the number of farms there increased from 56 in 1991 to 146 in 2001.  The growth of [[genetically modified crops]] also became common. One of the most notable in this regard is [[canola]]. Developed in Canada from rapeseed during the 1970s by Keith Downey and Baldur Stefansson it is used to produce oil that is low in erucic acid and glucosinolate and has become a major cash crop in North America. A strain of canola with additional modification that made it resistant to herbicide was introduced in Canada in 1996.

===Robotics===
The use of computer-controlled [[robots]] in manufacturing ([[computer-aided manufacturing]]) as well as the closely associated, [[Just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]] inventory management technique, were pioneered in Canada by the auto manufacturers, who introduced them to improve efficiency. They were put to use in new auto manufacturing plants built, by [[Honda of Canada Manufacturing|Honda Canada]] in Alliston, Ontario and [[Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada|Toyota Canada]] in Cambridge, Ontario (1988). The techniques of robotic assembly-line manufacturing have improved over the years. As of 2009 robots form the basis for automobile production in Canada with a number of facilities and companies using this technology, including (city, company, model):
* Alliston, Ontario; Honda, Acura CSX, Acura MDX, Civic; 
* Oshawa, Ontario, General Motors, Camaro, Chevrolet Impala; 
* Ingersoll, Ontario, General Motors (CAMI - GM Suzike), Chevrolet Equinox, GMC Terrain; 
* Brampton, Ontario, Chrysler, Chrysler 300, Dodge Challenger, Dodge Charger;
* Windsor, Ontario, Chrysler/Volkswagen, Chrysler Town and Country, Dodge Grand Caravan, Volkswagen Routan;
* Oakville, Ontario, Ford, Edge, Grand Marquis, Lincoln MKX;
* Cambridge, Ontario, Toyota, Matrix, Corolla, Lexus RX;
* St. Thomas, Ontario, Ford, Crown Victoria, Lincoln Town Car and
* Woodstock, Ontario, Toyota, RAV4.

===Space technology: earth observation and geomatics===

[[Geomatics]], a term that originated in Canada, is a technique of computer-based mapping that integrates information from a variety of sources including, cartography, remote sensing (including images from RADARSAT), surveying, global satellite navigation systems, geodesy and photogrammetry. In the new century it has become an important tool used by Canadians in a variety of endeavours including, commerce, the environment, search and rescue, urban planning, defence and natural resource management among other things. The Geomatics Industry Association of Canada, founded in 1988, presently has a membership of more than 100 organizations.

During these years Canada's unmanned space programme included the first launching of a Canadian earth observation satellite, [[RADARSAT-1]] in 1995 and an improved version [[RADARSAT-2]] in 2007. Placed in polar orbits each of these satellites images almost the Earth's entire surface, every 24 days using a powerful synthetic aperture radar, SAR. The images have both operational and scientific applications and their data is of use in geology, hydrology, agriculture, cartography, forestry, climatology, urbanology, environmental studies, meteorology, oceanography and other fields. In 2009 the Canadian Space Agency announced a follow-up programme, [[RADARSAT Constellation]], which will see the launching of three earth observation satellites, in 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively, working as a trio to provide complete coverage of Canada's land and ocean surfaces as well as 95% of the surface of the world every 24 hours.

===Energy, offshore oil and gas===
The technology for offshore oil and gas extraction was introduced to Canada during these years. The first of several projects off of Canada’s east coast was the massive [[Hibernia (oil field)|Hibernia]] platform, a [[gravity base structure]] (GBS), built in Bull Arm, Newfoundland in the early 1990s. The 1.2 million ton structure was towed into place, 315&amp;nbsp;km to the south east of St. John's, Newfoundland, over the Hibernia off-shore oil reservoir, where it was positioned resting on the ocean floor in 80 meters of water with its superstructure rising 50 meters above the surface of the sea.  In 1997 the facility began to pump oil from the sea bottom. The oil is stored in giant on-board tanks and continuously off-loaded by a fleet of dedicated shuttle tankers which transport it to the shore-based oil refinery at Come-by-Chance, Newfoundland.

The nearby [[Terra Nova (oil field)|Terra Nova]], 350&amp;nbsp;km off shore, began to produce oil in 2002. The platform itself rests on the ocean floor and pumps oil from the sea bottom. However, unlike the Hibernia facility, the oil flows directly into a [[Floating Production Storage and Offloading]] (FPSO) vessel, the [[Terra Nova FPSO]], where it is processed and stored. The oil in the storage tanks is then removed by a shuttle tanker. A third oil production facility in the same area, the [[White Rose (oil field)]], operated by Husky Petroleum, which began operation in 2005 also uses a Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel, the [[SeaRose FPSO]].

Undersea pipelines, the first in Canada and part of the [[Sable Offshore Energy Project]] have been introduced to transport gas from undersea wells off the coast of Nova Scotia since 2000. Gas was discovered near Sable Island in 1979 with the first platform and well head installed in the Thebaud field in 1999. An on-shore gas treatment facility was built at Goldboro and connected to the wellhead with a 225&amp;nbsp;km long undersea pipeline and production began in 2000. Other fields have been connected via undersea pipeline including the North Triumph, Venture, Alma and South Venture.

Other notable energy works included, the ill-fated east coast [[Ocean Ranger]] drilling platform, which sank in a storm in 1982 with the loss of all aboard, the Nova Scotia Power Corporation tidal generating station, Annapolis, 1984 and the [[Darlington Nuclear Generating Station]], Darlington, Ontario, 1990. The construction of large-scale hydro-electric plants far from electric markets lead to the introduction of techniques for long distance [[electric power transmission]]. These techniques were used at a number of sites, including the W.A.C Bennett hydro station in British Columbia in 1968, [[Churchill Falls]], Labrador, 1971 and the [[Robert-Bourassa generating station]], 1981, the [[La Grande-3 generating station]], 1984, the [[La Grande-4 generating station]], 1986 and the [[La Grande-2-A generating station]], 1992, all in Quebec.

===Biotechnology===

[[Biotechnology]] involves modifying living organisms to serve human goals. Biological techniques are derived from a number of sciences including, biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, genetics, botany, zoology, microbiology and embryology to name a few.  In 1987, a number of Canadian companies and university research organizations operating in the field of biotechnology established the Industrial Biotechnology Association of Canada, also known as BIOTECanada. In 2005, the industry consisted of companies offering biotechnologically based services and products in the following sectors: human health (262 firms), agriculture (89 firms), food processing (54 firms), environment (33 firms), bioinformatics (16 firms), natural resources (21 firms) and aquaculture (15 firms).&lt;ref&gt;''Biotechnology in Canada: A Technology Platform for Growth'', Conference Board of Canada, Decemober 2005&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010 BIOTECanada had more than 250 members.

In 2005 noted bio-medical spenders on biotechnological research (research spending in millions of C$) included, Apotex Inc. (151.1), Pfizer Canada Inc. (147.5), GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (111.8), Merck Frosst Canada Ltd. (96.6), Biovail Corporation (88.9), AstraZeneca Canada Inc. (79.8) and Sanofi Pasteur Limited (76.6).&lt;ref&gt;RESEARCH, Canada's Top 100 Corporate R&amp;D List, Infosource Inc. 2006 (2/2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another product of biotechnology, [[genetically modified crops]], are grown throughout Canada. One of the most widely known, [[canola]] was developed in Canada through selective breeding in 1974. Canola oil is used in food products and in non-food items such as lipstick, candles, bio-fuels and newspaper ink. One of the largest suppliers of genetically modified seeds for food crops and animal feed in Canada is Monsanto Canada, established in Winnipeg in 1901.

===Medicine===
Medical treatment advanced during these years. The use of lasers and computers became important parts of medical treatment. Computers were essential in the development of new medical imaging devices such as the [[CAT scan]], [[positron emission tomography]] and the [[MRI]]. Minimally invasive surgery, also known as [[laparoscopic surgery]], reduced surgical damage to patients. Lasers were used with catheters for clearing blocked arteries and catheters with small cameras provided images of conditions inside the body. [[Coronary bypass surgery]] became commonplace. [[Laser eye surgery]] became popular in the 1990s and was used to improve visual acuity for the near-sighted. New chemical chemotherapy combinations helped prolong the lives of cancer patients. Techniques for the long-term application of medication through the use of a skin patch or implants appeared during these years.

A large number of medical drugs ([[List of bestselling drugs]]) for treating a wide variety of ailments such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, arthritis, allergies, anemia, depression, asthma, osteoporosis and diabetes, became available to Canadians during this period.

The techniques for blood collection, processing and transfusion came under severe criticism in Canada during the 1980s, and led to Canada's worst-ever public health crisis. Between 1980 and 1985, 2000 recipients of tainted blood provided by the [[Canadian Red Cross]] were infected with the [[HIV|HI virus]]. Between 1980 and 1990, 30,000 Canadian transfusion recipients were infected with [[hepatitis C]] from tainted blood. About 8000 of those who received bad blood have died or are expected to die as a result. An investigation known as the [[Royal Commission of Inquiry on the Blood System in Canada]] was launched in 1993 and issued its final report in 1997.

A private company, IVF Canada of Scarborough, was the first to begin offering [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) in Canada beginning in 1983. Since that date the company has recorded a number of Canadian "firsts" in this field, including the first IVF pregnancy, first IVF twins, the first IVF triplets and the first baby born from a frozen embryo.&lt;ref&gt;web site, IVF Canada, www.ivfcanada.com&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1998 male erectile difficulties could be treated with the use of [[Viagra]] and other medications.

===Domestic and consumer technology===
There were innovations in home design and construction during this period. Houses generally became bigger. New materials such as [[Vinyl siding|vinyl]] siding became common and often replaced more expensive brick for home exteriors. The car port and garage became widespread features and the latter was often located close to the curb, creating a rather crowded streetscape. The home [[dishwasher]] and the [[microwave oven]] were introduced. Large-screen televisions usually of the cathode ray or projection type were found in many homes. The [[Sony Walkman]], introduced in 1979, quickly gained popularity as a means for listening to music on the go. There were innovations in the field of domestic cuisine including the introduction of [[microwave popcorn]]. In 1981, the development of the susceptor bag (a paper bag impregnated with an aluminum-coated polyester film), allowed popcorn therein to be popped in a microwave oven without scorching.

The [[compact disc]] (CD) and the [[digital video disc]] (DVD) were introduced at this time. The CD, which appeared in 1982, became a favourite format for musical recordings. By 1986 most music stores in Canada had phased out the LP and replaced it with the CD. It was also used for other purposes including data storage in the form of the CD-ROM. A closely related format, the DVD, with greater storage capacity than the CD, was introduced in 1997. In 1986, Americ Disc of Drummondville, Quebec began to manufacture CDs and after 1997, DVDs and has become one of the largest suppliers of this product in North America. The infrared-based TV [[remote control]] became popular with Canadians in the early 1980s.

[[Video games]] have become a wildly popular form of entertainment especially for youth, since the 1980s. The earliest video game dated from 1947 and a number of devices were produced in the 1950s and 1960s. However, it was the development of the computer chip that led to their popularization. The coin-operated arcade game ''Pong'' introduced by [[Atari]] in 1972 was the first to become widely available. The next phase of development included the introduction in the mid-1970s of the home console, first with a hardwired game, but then complemented in 1977 by “plug and play”, which allowed the use of game cartridges for variety. Beginning in 1985 PC gaming became popular, exploiting the flexibility and increasing popularity of the personal computer. In 1989 [[Nintendo]] released its Game Boy, the first of the hand-held electronic games. Game imagery became more elaborate with the introduction of the 32-bit chip that was featured in the Sony [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] released in 1994. The 128-bit, sixth generation of video games was born with the introduction of the Sega [[Dreamcast]] in 1998. These technologies found a place in the Canadian consumer market from the moment of their introduction and Canadian companies have played a role in their development, with hardware makers like [[ATI Technologies]] developing high-powered video chips for game imagery and software companies developing a number of games.

[[Gore-Tex]], a breathable, waterproof textile, was patented in the US in 1980. Clothing made from this product and designed for outdoor all-weather, sporting, athletic and recreational activity  became available in Canada shortly thereafter.

The [[theme park]] became popular in the 1980s and the technology of thrill is the main attraction. In Toronto, [[Canada's Wonderland]], Canada’s largest, opened its doors to the public in 1981 and is now tied for second place in North America as the theme park with the most roller coasters ([[List of roller coasters at Canada's Wonderland]]). [[Galaxyland]] the world's largest indoor amusement park located in the [[West Edmonton Mall]] which opened in 1981 has garnered continent-wide attention. The most popular thrill ride, the [[Mindbender (Galaxyland)]] is the largest indoor triple-loop roller coaster in North America. The Drop of Doom was another featured attraction until closed in the early 2000s. The Mall's [[World Waterpark]], which opened in 1985 offers bathers a chance to cavort in the world’s largest indoor wave pool. The technology of auto racetrack design and construction has been put to good use in Montreal at the [[Circuit Gilles Villeneuve]], Canada’s premier auto race track and home of the [[Canadian Grand Prix]] Formula 1 motor car races since 1978. The [[slot machine]], so dear to gamblers, was introduced during this period. Casinos have been built in Windsor, [[Caesars Windsor]] 1994, Niagara Falls, [[Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort]] 1996 and Orillia, [[Casino Rama]] 1996, Ontario, Montreal, [[Montreal Casino]], Gatineau, [[Casino du Lac Leamy]] 1996 and Baie St. Paul, [[Casino de Charlevoix]] 1994,  Quebec, Halifax, [[Casino Nova Scotia]] 1995, Nova Scotia and in Vancouver, the [[River Rock Casino Resort]] 2006, British Columbia.

The world’s first [[automated teller machine]] (ATM) service was developed by the Sherwood Credit Union in Regina in 1977, at that institution’s North Albert Branch. Other Canadian financial institutions followed this lead and by the 1980s the ATM was available throughout Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Web Site, www.canadacool.com/COOLFACTS/SASKATCHEWAN/ReginaATM.html&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s the [[bar code]] became a familiar feature on consumer products ranging from food to clothes as did the bar code scanner at the retail checkout counter. These two technologies greatly improved the effectiveness of the check-out procedure and improved inventory management as well, through the associated computer accounting of stock. This was one of the factors leading to the technique of just-in-time inventory management for retail, commercial and industrial undertakings.

The payment of consumer purchases at the retail checkout counter through the use of an electronic debit card was introduced across Canada in 1994. Known as [[Interac]], the system allows the consumer to swipe his personal card and with the use of a [[personal identification number]] have the amount of the purchase electronically deducted from his or her bank account. The service has since become very popular.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Waste disposal, recycling===
Although the concept of recycling waste materials was not new, the [[Blue Box Recycling System]] for domestic refuse collection made the idea highly visible. Initially developed by Laidlaw Waste Systems for the Kitchener, Ontario, in 1983, it was introduced to Ontario municipalities in 1986, by Ontario Multi-Material Recycling Incorporated (OMMRI), and promoted by Nyle Ludolph, who became known as the Father of the Blue Box. The concept involved the use of blue plastic boxes which were distributed to home owners, who in turn filled them with recyclable refuse and placed them at curbside for weekly pickup. The refuse was taken to specially designed plants, where materials were sorted and recycled. The technique became popular in municipalities across Canada in the years that followed.&lt;ref&gt;web site, Pollution Probe, www.pollutionprobe.org/Reports/we%20recycle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During these years the municipal garbage dump evolved to become the sanitary landfill site. A number of technologies, including clay and plastic liners were used to contain the smell and [[leachate]]. The largest in Canada, the [[Keele Valley Landfill]] was operated by the City of Toronto from 1983 until 2002, when it was closed because it was full.

[[Chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFCs), the gas propellants used in aerosol spray cans, became a target for environmental concern in the 1970s and 1980s when research demonstrated that they had a harmful effect on the ozone layer in the atmosphere. The international [[Montreal Protocol]] of 1989 banned the use of these substances and they were subsequently replaced with volatile hydrocarbons.

The problem with choice to reuse is still not available. There are many products that don't need to be recycled for a hundred years, but are put out monthly.

===Architecture and civil engineering===
Large architectural works of note included BC Place, Vancouver, 1983, [[Petro-Canada Centre]], West Tower, Calgary, 1984, the [[West Edmonton Mall]], Edmonton, Alberta, 1986,  Scotia Plaza, Toronto 1988, the Canterra Tower, Calgary, 1988, the [[Sky Dome]], Toronto, 1989, Bankers Hall, Calgary, 1989, BCE Place–Canada Trust Tower, Toronto, 1990, the Bay Wellington Tower, Toronto, 1990, Tour du 1000 de la Gauchetière, Montreal, 1991, Tour IBM-Marathon, Montreal, 1992 and [[GM Place]], Vancouver, 1995.

New arenas for Canada's National Hockey League teams were built, including [[GM Place]], Vancouver, home of the [[Vancouver Canucks]] in 1995, the [[Corel Centre]] in Ottawa, home of the [[Ottawa Senators]] and [[Molson Centre]] in Montreal, new home of the Montreal Canadiens, both in 1996.

Significant new bridges included the [[Alex Fraser Bridge]], Vancouver, 1986, the [[Skybridge (TransLink)]], Vancouver, 1989 and the [[Confederation Bridge]], NB-PEI, 1997.

==End note==

In the earlier parts of Canada's history, the state often played a crucial role in the diffusion of these technologies, in some cases through a monopoly enterprise, in others with a private "partner". In more recent times the need for the role of the state has diminished in the presence of a larger private sector.

In the latter part of the 20th century there is evidence that Canadian values prefer public expenditures on social programmes at the expense of public spending on the maintenance and expansion of public technical infrastructure. This can be seen in the fact that in 2008 the Federation of Canadian Municipalities estimated that it would take $123 billion to restore and repair aging urban infrastructure across Canada.

'''''The End of Night: Searching for Natural Darkness in an Age of Artificial Light''''' is a 2013 non-fiction book by Paul Bogard on the gradual disappearance, due to [[light pollution]], of true [[darkness]] from the [[night sky|night skies]] of most people on the planet. Bogard examines the effects of this loss on human physical and mental health, society, and ecosystems, and how it might be mitigated.&lt;ref name="bogard-book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bogard|first1=Paul|title=The End of Night: Searching for Natural Darkness in an Age of Artificial Light|date=July 9, 2013|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|isbn=9780316182904|url=http://www.paul-bogard.com/books-and-writings/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has been translated into [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[German language|German]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref name="bogard-web-about"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
Bogard's book is structured into nine chapters, roughly corresponding to the nine levels of the [[Bortle scale]], which attempts to quantify the subjective [[brightness]] and suitability for [[astronomy]] of the sky in different environments. On his use of the scale, which was invented in 2001, Bogard has said, "one of the reasons why identifying different depths of darkness is so important is that we don’t recognize that we’re losing it, unless we have a name to recognize it by."&lt;ref name="twilley"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Twilley|first1=Nicola|first2=Geoff|last2=Manaugh|title=In Search of Darkness: An Interview with Paul Bogard|url=http://v-e-n-u-e.com/In-Search-of-Darkness-An-Interview-with-Paul-Bogard|accessdate=21 July 2016|work=Venue|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bogard begins at a Bortle level 9 environment, by the [[Luxor Sky Beam]], the brightest spotlight on Earth, located on the [[Las Vegas Strip]]. He explores the nighttime landscapes of [[London]] and [[Paris]], and examines the planning, or lack thereof, in each city's lighting. He visits locations throughout the continental US, as well as [[Florence]], the [[Canary Islands]], and the isle of [[Sark]], in his quest to understand the nature of light pollution. He experiences firsthand the deleterious effects of night [[shift work]], talks with a former prison inmate about the psychological effects of uninterrupted light, and shares his own [[fear of the dark]].&lt;ref name="bogard-book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vickers"/&gt; Bogard ultimately finds a Bortle level 1 environment: an environment so perfectly free of stray light that the [[Milky Way]] casts noticeable shadows.&lt;ref name="twilley"/&gt;

Bogard argues against the long-held assumption of a correlation between bright light and reduced crime, citing research that finds no such link. Rather than suggesting a return to the completely unlit nights of centuries past, however, he argues for a careful consideration of where and how light is deployed, in order to provide sufficient nighttime illumination for safety, without creating [[glare (vision)|glare]] and other unwanted effects.&lt;ref name="cross"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cross|first1=Stephanie|title=The End Of Night by Paul Bogard, review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/non_fictionreviews/10213692/The-End-Of-Night-by-Paul-Bogard-review.html|accessdate=21 July 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'' reviewer Stephanie Cross wrote that "the appeal of Bogard’s book derives not just from his often wide-eyed enthusiasm for his subject, but also from the constellation of characters he encounters on his journeys into the night."&lt;ref name="cross"/&gt; In ''[[The Guardian]]'', novelist [[Salley Vickers]] wrote that "Bogard sets about his investigations with an energetic purposiveness and enterprise," but complained that "the book comes to seem a little thin, moving too rapidly from one chatty anecdotal meeting to another."&lt;ref name="vickers"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vickers|first1=Salley|authorlink=Salley Vickers|title=The End of Night by Paul Bogard – review: Would less artificial light be better for us all?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/14/end-night-paul-bogard-review|accessdate=21 July 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' questioned Bogard's statements on the relationship between light and safety, and concluded ambivalently: "''The End of Night'' delivers a forceful, if incomplete, critique of our overexposed world."&lt;ref name="Ekirch"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ekirch|first1=A. Roger|title=Embracing the Dark Side|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323683504578565800769774778|accessdate=21 July 2016|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
The book was awarded the 2014 [[Nautilus Award|Nautilus Silver Award]]. It was named an [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] Best Book of the Month and Nonfiction Editor's Pick for July 2013, and ''[[Gizmodo]]'' selected it as one of its Best Books of 2013. The book was [[short list|shortlisted]] for the [[PEN/E. O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award]], and was a finalist for the [[Sigurd F. Olson]] Nature Writing Award.&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The End of Night: Searching for Natural Darkness in an Age of Artificial Light|asin=0316182915|website=Amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''waterhole''', or '''water hole''', is an especially quiet [[band (radio)|band]] of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] between 1.42 and 1.67 [[gigahertz]], corresponding to wavelengths of 21 and 18 centimeters respectively.  It is a popular observing frequency used by [[radio telescope]]s in [[radio astronomy]].   The term was coined by [[Bernard M. Oliver|Bernard Oliver]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Monte Ross: ''The search for extraterrestrials - intercepting alien signals.'' Springer, New York, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-387-73453-8}}, p.95&lt;/ref&gt; The strongest [[hydroxyl radical]] [[spectroscopy|spectral line]] radiates at 18 centimeters, and [[hydrogen line|hydrogen]] at 21 centimeters. These two molecules, which combined form [[water]], are widespread in interstellar gas, and their presence absorbs radio noise at these frequencies.  Therefore, the spectrum between these frequencies form a "quiet" channel in the interstellar [[radio noise]] background.  Bernard M. Oliver theorized that the waterhole would be an obvious band for [[communication with extraterrestrial intelligence]],&lt;ref&gt;SETI League [http://www.setileague.org/general/waterhol.htm What is the Water-Hole?] (accessed 17 September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; hence the name, which is a form of pun: in English, a watering hole is a [[vernacular]] reference to a common place to meet and talk. Several programs involved in the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]], including [[SETI@home]], search in the waterhole radio frequencies.
