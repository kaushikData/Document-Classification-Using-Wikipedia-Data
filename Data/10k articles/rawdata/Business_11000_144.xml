'''1221 Avenue of the Americas''' (formerly also known as the '''McGraw-Hill Building''') is a skyscraper located at 1221 [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]], in [[Midtown Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. 

==Description==
[[File:McGraw-Hill sundial jeh.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Sunken courtyard]]
[[File:1221 AA maps jeh.jpg|left|upright|thumb|World maps]]

The building was part of the later [[Rockefeller Center]] expansion (1960s&amp;ndash;1970s) dubbed the [[Construction of Rockefeller Center#1960s and 1970s|"XYZ Buildings"]]. Their plans were first drawn in 1963 by the [[Rockefeller family]]'s architect, [[Wallace Harrison]], of the architectural firm [[Harrison and Abramovitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Krinsky | first=Carol H. |author-link=Carol Herselle Krinsky | title=Rockefeller Center | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1978 | isbn=978-0-19-502404-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7xlDAQAAIAAJ | page=117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their letters correspond to their height. [[1251 Avenue of the Americas]] is the "X" Building as it is the tallest at 750&amp;nbsp;ft (229 m) and 54 stories, and was the first completed, in 1971. The "Y" is 1221 Avenue of the Americas, which was the second tower completed (1973) and is the second in height (674&amp;nbsp;ft and 51 stories). The "Z" Building, the shortest and the youngest, is [[1211 Avenue of the Americas]] with 45 stories (592&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Manhattan Skyscrapers | chapter=XYZ Buildings Exxon Building McGraw-Hill Building Celanese Building | publisher=Princeton Archit.Press | publication-place=New York, NY | isbn=978-1-56898-545-9 | doi=10.1007/1-56898-652-1_57 | pages=127–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The building is the former headquarters of [[McGraw-Hill Financial]], from which it derived its former name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McGraw Hill Moves Downtown, Says Goodbye to Namesake Building|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/07/08/mcgraw-hill-moves-downtown-says-goodbye-to-namesake-building/|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other tenants include [[Sirius XM Holdings|Sirius XM Satellite Radio]], whose headquarters and broadcast facility are in the building.

The sunken courtyard of this building contains a large metal triangle designed by [[Athelstan Spilhaus]] and fabricated by Tyler Elevator Products, arranged so the Sun aligns with its sides at [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/city_of_stars/18_mcgraw_hill.html Natural History Magazine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705204223/http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/city_of_stars/18_mcgraw_hill.html |date=July 5, 2008 }} Sun triangle&lt;/ref&gt; When built, the southwestern corner held a display of scale models of planets in the Solar System. A mosaic map of the Earth survives in the northwestern corner.

==1999 elevator incident==
After entering an express elevator at approximately 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. ([[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]) Friday on October 15, 1999, Nicholas White, an employee of the building, who was going down to take a cigarette break, became trapped after a brief [[power dips|power dip]] caused the elevator to stop between the 13th and 14th floors. Though he signaled an alarm and there was surveillance video inside the elevator cab, White was not rescued until approximately 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Sunday, October 17, nearly 41 hours later, after security guards spotted him in the surveillance cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html|title=The Big City; Aftermath Of 40 Hours In an Elevator|last=Tierney|first=John|date=1999-10-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-07|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/04/21/up-and-then-down|title=Up and Then Down|last=|first=|date=2008-04-21|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The buildings are featured in the opening credits of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', seen from below looking up in the street from a car. It was used for the exteriors and lobby of Elias-Clarke's headquarters in the 2006 film ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'' and the interior shots for ''[[Suits (U.S. TV series)|Suits]]''. It is also the headquarters of [[Sirius XM Radio]], and many radio shows broadcast from the building including ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2171">The '''Alexander''' family was a prominent [[Croatia]]n Jewish family from [[Zagreb]]. Alexander family ancestors moved to Zagreb from [[Güssing]] in [[Austria]]. For a century, the family played an important role in the economic and social life of Zagreb. Until 1941 and the establishment of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] the Alexanders were a large clan.

The great-grandparents of the Zagreb Alexanders were Samuel and Julija ([[née]] Neumann) Alexander, who had five sons and several daughters. Counting all of their deceased and still living members, including also the descendants of the female line, there were 224 Alexanders in seven generations. Many members of the family perished during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. Today only one male descendant bears the surname Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ivan Mirnik|2012|pp=395–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Ivan Mirnik; ''Obitelj Alexander ili kratka kronika izbrisanog vremena''; Institute of Croatian History, [[Faculty of Philosophy, University of Zagreb]]; 1995 Zagreb; Vol. 28; pp. 108, 109, 110, 111, 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrew Cowan''' (born 13 December 1936) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] former [[rally driver]], and the founder and senior director of [[Ralliart|Mitsubishi Ralliart]] until his retirement on 30 November 2005.

==Early years==
Cowan was raised in [[Duns]], a small town in the [[Scottish Borders]], where he established a longstanding close friendship with future [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Formula One world champion]] [[Jim Clark]], also a young farmer and the same age as himself. According to Cowan their lifestyles were a great help in their subsequent careers: ''"We each had to have a car. We were able to drive in fields, off road, and of course through all the twisty roads around here where there was practically no traffic in those days. That definitely refined our driving skills. We had advantages that other drivers didn't."''&lt;ref name="scot"&gt;[http://motors.scotsman.com/features.cfm?id=2450592005 "Borders farmer who cultivated speed, honour and Mitsubishi"], Rick Wilson, ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 23 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Both men were active in the [[Berwick and District Motor Club]] during the 1950s, but while Clark gravitated to open-wheeled racing, Cowan ventured off-road, and took part in the 1960 [[RAC Rally]], eventually finishing 43rd of over 200 starters in a [[Sunbeam Rapier]]. Impressed by his success, his father bought him a newer, more powerful Rapier as a replacement, and behind the wheel of his new vehicle, he won the 1962 [[Scottish Rally]], an achievement he later declared to be his "Most Important Moment". He returned the following year to successfully defend his title,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottishrally.co.uk/index.cfm?fuseaction=Previous_Winners&amp;menu=SpectatorMenu RSAC Scottish Rally – Previous winners] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501071452/http://www.scottishrally.co.uk/index.cfm?fuseaction=Previous_Winners&amp;menu=SpectatorMenu |date=May 1, 2006 }}, ScottishRally.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result the [[Rootes Group]] invited him to become their 'works' driver.&lt;ref name="scot"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imps4ever.info/racing/rallies/cowan.html "Andrew Cowan"], ''The Imp Site''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behind the wheel==
Once established as a professional driver, Cowan had many notable successes with both Rootes and subsequently [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]], for whom he signed in 1972. Aside from his two Scottish Rally titles, he won the first two [[London-Sydney Marathon]]s in 1968 and 1977,&lt;ref name="scot"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://marathon68.homestead.com/billkneipp.html Pictorial account of the 1968 London – Sydney Marathon], Bill Kneipp&lt;/ref&gt; five consecutive [[Southern Cross Rally|Southern Cross Rallies]] (1972–76), the 1977 [[Rallye Bandama Côte d'Ivoire]], and the world's longest rally, the 20,000-mile South American Marathon in 1978. He was also competitive in the [[Safari Rally]] where he recorded a top four finish four times in five years, and latterly the [[Paris-Dakar Rally]] where his best result was second overall in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=profile&amp;driverid=5856 Profile and international competitive record of Andrew Cowan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104164347/http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=profile&amp;driverid=5856 |date=January 4, 2007 }}, RallyBase.nl&lt;/ref&gt; He retired as a driver in 1990.&lt;ref name="scot"/&gt;

For his achievements in 1977, he was awarded the British Guild of Motoring Writers' ''Driver of the Year'' Award, the ''Jim Clark Memorial Trophy'' for "outstanding achievement by a Scottish driver", and the [[British Racing Drivers' Club]]'s ''[[John Cobb (racing driver)|John Cobb]] Trophy'' for a British driver of outstanding success.

==Behind a desk==
In 1983, [[Mitsubishi Motors]] asked him to establish a [[Europe]]an base for their motorsport activities, and so he founded [[Andrew Cowan Motorsports (ACMS)]]. Based in [[Rugby, Warwickshire]], it would evolve into [[Ralliart|Mitsubishi Ralliart Europe]], and his cars took [[Tommi Makinen]] to four consecutive [[List of World Rally Championship Drivers' Champions|WRC Drivers']] titles ([[1996 World Rally Championship season|1996]] to [[1999 World Rally Championship season|1999]]), as well as winning Mitsubishi their only [[List of World Rally Championship Constructors' Champions|manufacturers' crown]] in [[1998 World Rally Championship season|1998]].

In 2003, Mitsubishi Motors officially took over the business and renamed it Mitsubishi Motorsport, although Cowan remained as "Sporting Advisor" for the next two years until his retirement aged 69.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carpages.co.uk/mitsubishi/mitsubishi_takes_over_andrew_cowan_motorsports_06_04_03.asp "Mitsubishi Motors Takes Over Andrew Cowan Motorsports"], Carpages.co.uk, 6 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, Cowan took part in the ''[[Colin McRae]] Forest Stages Rally'', a round of the [[Scottish Rally Championship]]. He was one of a number of former rally drivers to take part in the event in memory of McRae, who died in 2007.

[[File:Brisbane map of city cbd.png|right|thumb|upright|Map of the CBD]]
The '''Brisbane central business district''' (CBD), officially gazetted as the suburb of '''Brisbane City''' and colloquially referred to as 'the city', is the heart of the state capital of [[Queensland]], Australia.&lt;ref name=qpn&gt;{{cite QPN|49245|Brisbane|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located on a point on the northern bank of the [[Brisbane River]]. The triangular shaped area is bounded by the Brisbane River to the east, south and west. The point, known at its tip as [[Gardens Point, Brisbane|Gardens Point]], slopes upward to the north-west where the city is bounded by parkland and the inner city suburb of [[Spring Hill, Queensland|Spring Hill]] to the north. The CBD is bounded to the north-east by the suburb of [[Fortitude Valley, Queensland|Fortitude Valley]]. To the west the CBD is bounded by [[Petrie Terrace]], which in 2010 was reinstated as a suburb (after being made a locality of Brisbane City in the 1970s).

== Geography ==
[[File:Bne2017 2.png|thumb|Skyline of the central business district from Mount Coot-tha 2017.]]
The Brisbane central business district is an area of densely concentrated skyscrapers and other buildings, interspersed by several parks such as [[Roma Street Parklands]], [[City Botanic Gardens]] and [[Wickham Park, Brisbane|Wickham Park]]. It occupies an area of 1.367&amp;nbsp;km². The City is laid out according to a grid pattern surveyed during the city's early colonial days, a feature typical of most Australian street patterns. As a general rule, the streets aligned northwest-south east are named after male members of the [[House of Hanover]], while the northeast-south west aligned streets are named after female members.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} [[Queen Street, Brisbane|Queen Street]] was the central roadway, that was turned into a [[pedestrian mall]]. It forms the pivotal axis for the grid of roads within the district.

The Brisbane central business district was built on a spur of the [[Taylor Range (Queensland)|Taylor Range]] with the highest spot in the suburb being [[Wickham Terrace]].&lt;ref name="thenandnow"&gt;{{cite book |title=Brisbane Then and Now |last=Gregory |first=Helen  |year=2007 |publisher=Salamander Books |location=Wingfield, South Australia |isbn=978-1-74173-011-1 |page=60 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[North Quay, Brisbane|North Quay]] is an area in the CBD that was a landing point during the first European exploration of the [[Brisbane River]].

=== Petrie Bight ===
{{Main|Petrie Bight}}
Petrie Bight is a reach of the [[Brisbane River]] ({{coord|-27.4636|153.0351|type:river_region:AU-QLD|name=Petrie Bight}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite QPN|26538|Petrie Bight|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives its name to the small pocket of land centred on the area under the [[Story Bridge]]'s northern point, around the Brisbane River to [[Admiralty Towers II]]. The location was originally known as Petrie Gardens and was an early settlement farm, one of two that provided food for the colony.&lt;ref name="btn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/queensland/federation/stories/s281845.htm |title=Brisbane – Then and Now – The Centenary of Federation |accessdate=21 August 2009 |date=24 April 2001 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110010052/http://www.abc.net.au/queensland/federation/stories/s281845.htm |archivedate=10 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was named after Andrew Petrie and has been the base for water police and in earlier times wharves.&lt;ref name="thenandnow2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Brisbane Then and Now |last=Gregory |first=Helen |year=2007 |publisher=Salamander Books |location=Wingfield, South Australia |isbn=978-1-74173-011-1 |page=20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of [[Customs House, Brisbane|Customs House]] and the preference for wharves was due to site being directly downstream from the central business district.&lt;ref name="thenandnow2" /&gt;

The Brisbane City Library opened in 1965, moving into [[Brisbane Square]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.plconnect.slq.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/388497/SLQ_StatsBulletin1617_20171109.pdf|title=Public Libraries Statistical Bulletin 2016-17|last=|first=|date=November 2017|website=Public Libraries Connect|publisher=[[State Library of Queensland]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180130022546/http://www.plconnect.slq.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/388497/SLQ_StatsBulletin1617_20171109.pdf|archive-date=30 January 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last few decades the number of [[apartment building]]s that have been constructed has increased substantially.
Brisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Brisbane|Australia's tallest buildings]]. Brisbane's tallest buildings are Skytower at 270 metres, One William Street at 260 metres, [[Soleil (Brisbane)|Soleil]] at 243&amp;nbsp;metres, [[Aurora Tower]] at 207&amp;nbsp;metres, [[Riparian Plaza]] at 200&amp;nbsp;metres, [[One One One Eagle Street]] at 195 metres, and [[Infinity Tower (Brisbane)|Infinity]] at 249&amp;nbsp;metres, which was completed in 2014.

The Brisbane CBD is one of the major business hubs in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etravelblackboard.com/index.asp?id=73027&amp;nav=13|title=Brisbane business visitor numbers skyrocket|date=3 January 2008|work=Brisbane Marketing Convention Bureau|publisher=e-Travel Blackboard|accessdate=13 January 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120134851/http://www.etravelblackboard.com/index.asp?id=73027&amp;nav=13|archivedate=20 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City contains many tall office buildings occupied by organisations, businesses and all three levels of government that have emerged into a number of precincts. The areas around the [[Queen Street Mall, Brisbane|Queen Street Mall]] and Adelaide Street is primarily a retail precinct. A legal precinct exists around the various court buildings located around the intersections of [[George Street, Brisbane|George Street]] and [[Adelaide Street, Brisbane|Adelaide]] and [[Ann Street, Brisbane|Ann]] Streets.

The government precinct is an area centred on the [[Lands Administration Building|Executive Building]] that includes many [[Government of Queensland|Queensland Government]] offices. [[111 George Street]], [[Mineral House]], and [[Education House]] are also located here.

The Brisbane CBD has only one third the number of premium hotel rooms that either Sydney or Melbourne's central business districts have.&lt;ref name="n32"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/business/property/new-32storey-hotel-planned-for-cbd-20101129-18e1i.html |title=New 32-storey hotel planned for CBD |author=Tony Moore |accessdate=30 November 2010 |date=30 November 2010 |work=[[Brisbane Times]] |publisher=Fairfax Media |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201103352/http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/business/property/new-32storey-hotel-planned-for-cbd-20101129-18e1i.html |archivedate=1 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Schools ===
[[File:Brisbane CBD (11261000363).jpg|thumb|right|High rise view of the CBD at night.]]
The city is serviced by a number of schools in the surrounding suburbs including the [[Petrie Terrace State School]] in Paddington and The Albert Park Flexi School in [[Petrie Terrace]].

=== Rental prices ===
Like most other Australian capital cities, Brisbane has [[Australian property bubble|experienced dramatic rises in rental prices]] for residential and office space before the [[global financial crisis]]. At the beginning of 2008, the Brisbane central business district contained 1.7 million square metres of office space.&lt;ref name=news1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23170498-421,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070728091913/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23170498-421,00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 July 2007 |title=Business boom leaves Brisbane without office space |accessdate=25 November 2008 |date= |work=[[news.com.au]] |publisher=[[News Limited]] }} &lt;/ref&gt;
High demand in the office market had pushed vacancy rates in the Brisbane CBD to 0.7% by January 2008, the lowest in Australia.&lt;ref name=news1 /&gt; Premium grade office space was even less vacant with an occupancy rate of 99.9%. By the end of 2009 the situation had reversed.  In mid 2013 the market for office space had declined to its worst position in two decades with a vacancy rate of just under 13%.&lt;ref name="boso"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/brisbane-office-space-overload-20130814-2rwif.html |title=Brisbane office space overload |author=Marissa Calligeros |accessdate=15 August 2013 |date=15 August 2013 |work=Brisbane Times |publisher=Fairfax Media |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816014457/http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/brisbane-office-space-overload-20130814-2rwif.html |archivedate=16 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attractions ==
[[File:Brisbane Town Hall.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brisbane City Hall]] houses the [[Museum of Brisbane]] and offices of the [[Brisbane City Council]].]]
In the CBD there many attractions; [[Parliament House, Brisbane|Queensland's Parliament House]], the [[Queensland University of Technology]] Gardens Point Campus and the [[Brisbane City Hall]]. The [[Queens Gardens, Brisbane|Queens Gardens]], [[Post Office Square, Brisbane|Post Office Square]], [[King George Square, Brisbane|King George Square]] and the [[City Botanic Gardens]] are open public spaces located here.

The [[Brisbane City Council]] operates a public library in [[Brisbane Square]] at 266 George Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/facilities-recreation/libraries/library-opening-hours-locations|title=Library opening hours and locations|last=|first=|date=3 January 2018|website=[[Brisbane City Council]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180130022116/https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/facilities-recreation/libraries/library-opening-hours-locations|archive-date=30 January 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brisbane central business district is the central hub for all public transport services in Brisbane. Bus services are centred on the [[Queen Street bus station]] and [[King George Square busway station]]. Suburban train services pass through [[Central railway station, Brisbane|Central railway station]], and [[Roma Street railway station]]. Roma Street also serves as the terminus for long distance and country services. The central business district is served by various city ferries. Brisbane's [[CityCat]] high speed ferry service, popular with tourists and commuters, operates services along the [[Brisbane River]] between the [[University of Queensland]] and Northshore Hamilton, stopping at several CBD wharves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20131">'''Child labour in the diamond industry''' is a widely reported and criticized issue on [[diamond industry]] for using [[child labour]] in [[diamond mine]]s and polishing procedures in poor conditions mainly in [[India]] and [[Africa]]. In these mines, children come in contact with minerals, oil and machinery exhaust.&lt;ref name="ihscslnews"/&gt; In 1997, The [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] claimed that child labour was prospering in the diamond industry in Western India, where the majority of the world's diamonds are cut and polished while workers are often paid only a fraction of 1% of the value of the stones they cut.&lt;ref name=BBCBusiness&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/letter_from_america/15377.stm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120714093557/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/letter_from_america/15377.stm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 July 2012|title=Child Labour Crisis in Diamond Industry|date=26 October 1997|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is argued that [[economic growth]] in [[Western India]] in the 1980s-90s was associated with an increase in the number of child workers who do simple, repetitive manual tasks that do not require long years of training or experience in low-paying hazardous working conditions that involve drudgery, foreclose the option of school education for most of them.&lt;ref name=sciencedirect/&gt;

There are organizations and people who try to create a public awareness about the issue, including Janine Roberts, The [[Anti-Slavery Society]], [[Survival International]], IndianNGO, Child Labour News Service (CLNS) managed by the [[Global March Against Child Labor]], and IHS Child Slave Labor News.

==Reports==

===India===
{{Further|Child labour in India#Diamond industry}}
In 1997, the [[International Labour Organization]] published a report titled ''Child Labour in the Diamond Industry''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/dialogue/actrav/child/proj/childiam.htm|title=Child Labour in the Diamond Industry|publisher=[[International Labour Organization]]|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that child labour is highly prevalent in the Indian diamond industry. Child labourers constitute nearly 3% of the total workforce and the percentage of child labourers is as high as 25% in the diamond industry of [[Surat]]. The ICFTU further claimed that child labour was prospering in the diamond industry in western India, where the majority of the world's diamonds are cut and polished. Workers are often paid only a fraction of 1% of the value of the stones they cut.&lt;ref name=BBCBusiness&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/letter_from_america/15377.stm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120714093557/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/letter_from_america/15377.stm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 July 2012|title=Child Labour Crisis in Diamond Industry|date=26 October 1997|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pravin Nanavati, a Surat-based diamond businessman argued that, since high cost diamonds could easily be lost or broken while cutting or polishing, employing a child labourer would mean risking "[[lakhs]] of [[rupee]]s."  Some western countries have called for a [[boycott]] against the diamond industry for establishing a [[monopoly]] in the sector{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. Mohan Dhabuwala, secretary of The South Gujarat Diamond Workers Association, argued that while child labour is highly prevalent in the construction and hotel industries, there are few child labourers in the diamond industry of Surat, less than 1% according to their surveys, mainly because of stern punishments and penalties for violation of child labour laws.&lt;ref name="business-standard"&gt;{{cite web|author=Summit Khanna |location= Ahmedabad |date=2004-12-13 |url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/storypage.php?autono=195628 |title=Diamond industry plays down child labour charges |publisher=Business-standard.com |accessdate=2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Madhura Swaminathan from the [[Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research]] argued that economic growth in western India had been associated with an increase in the number of child workers over the previous 15 years and that children worked at simple repetitive manual tasks in low-paying hazardous jobs, foreclosing the option of school education.&lt;ref name=sciencedirect&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0305-750X(98)00063-1|title=Economic growth and the persistence of child labour: Evidence from an Indian city|year=1998|last1=Swaminathan|first1=M|journal=World Development|volume=26|page=1513|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, an India-based management consultancy firm, A. F. Ferguson &amp; Co., commissioned a study titled ''Child Labour from the Gem and Jewellery Industry'' "to spread awareness about child labour among the people connected with the industry". They studied 663 manufacturing units at 21 different locations in [[Gujarat]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Rajasthan]], [[West Bengal]] and [[Tamil Nadu]], as an initiative of the [[Gem &amp; Jewelry Export Promotion Council]]. On 12 February, the study was presented at a seminar held by the GJEPC and the Surat Diamond Association, in Surat, India. The report argued that the use of child labour in India’s diamond processing industry has been reduced from 0.55% in 1998 to 0.31% in 2005, "while for the [[synthetic stone]] industry it is estimated to be two-thirds less".

GJEPC chairman Bakul Mehta claimed that, "some 500 diamond factory owners took an oath in the city of Palanpur, Gujarat, (home town of leading Gujarati diamond merchants) not to employ children in their factories. Similarly, in Surat, 200 factory owners took the oath," and that GJEPC "remain committed to eradicating child labour from the Indian diamond industry”. He argued that "...the gem and jewelry industry cannot even think of employing children, not only for moral reasons, but that a child could be injured while polishing or cutting the diamonds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.diamonds.net/news/NewsItem.aspx?ArticleID=11399|title=Child Labor Practice Drops in India|last=Tanna|first=Ketan|date=14 February 2005|publisher=Rapaport News|accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=117676|title=Use of child labour in gem industry lower|date=14 February 2005|publisher=[[Indian express]]|accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/af-ferguson-report-slams-surat-diamond-industry/206061/|title=AF Ferguson report slams Surat diamond industry|last=Khanna|first=Summit |date= 23 February 2005|publisher=[[Business Standard]]|accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
On 28 August 2003, [[BBC news]] reported that during the 10-year [[civil war]] in Sierra Leone children were used as combatants and child labourers in the diamond mines of [[Koidu]] in the north-eastern district of Kono. Children aged between 5 and 16 were used in hard labour, for ten hours a day, "digging in soil and [[gravel]], before sifting with a pan for gemstones and shifting heavy mud believed to contain diamonds." In collaboration with [[World Vision]] and [[Aim Sierra Leone]], the Ministry of Gender and Children's Affairs registered 1,200 child miners to get them out of the mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3189299.stm|title=Children working in Sierra Leone mines|publisher=BBC news|date=28 August 2003 | first=Lansana | last=Fofana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 2009, [[Human Rights Watch]] published a 62-page report titled ''Diamonds in the Rough. [[Human Rights]] Abuses in the Marange Diamond Fields of Zimbabwe'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2009/06/26/diamonds-rough-0 Diamonds in the Rough Human Rights Abuses in the Marange Diamond Fields of Zimbabwe] by [[Human Rights Watch]] 26 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; based on its researchers' "more than 100 one-on-one interviews with witnesses, local miners, police officers, soldiers, local community leaders, victims and relatives, medical staff, human rights lawyers, and activists in [[Harare]], [[Mutare]], and [[Marange]] district in eastern [[Zimbabwe]]", conducted in February 2009. 

According to the report, "following the discovery of diamonds in Marange in June 2006, the police and army have used brutal force to control access to the diamond fields and to take over unlicensed diamond mining and trading. Some income from the fields has been funnelled to high-level party members of [[ZANU-PF]], which is now part of a power-sharing government that urgently needs revenue as the country faces a dire economic crisis."  According to the report, some children work up to eleven hours per day with no pay, and by the estimate of a local lawyer, up to 300 children continue to work for soldiers in the Marange diamond fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/06/26/diamonds-deadly-toll|title=Diamonds’ Deadly Toll|date=26 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In December 2014, the [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]] issued a ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'' that mentioned [[Angola]], the [[Central African Republic]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Guinea]], [[Liberia]], and [[Sierra Leone]] as part of the 74 countries with significant incidence of [[child labor]] and [[forced labor]] as far as the diamond industry is concerned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods/ List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Working conditions ==
{{Refimprove|date=September 2009}}

Child Slave Labor News argued that it is reported that in the late 1980s, about 11% and in 1994, 16% of the workforce was underage in diamond industry. "Currently{{Clarify|date=September 2009}} there are over 171 million children that work in hazardous work sites such as factories and mines."&lt;ref name=ihscslnews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ihscslnews.org/view_article.php?id=162|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130114031418/http://ihscslnews.org/view_article.php?id=162|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-14|date=November 2006|title=Diamonds Are Forever, But Not The Lives Of Child Workers|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSLN further argued the diamond mines are dangerous work sites, "open pits of heavy minerals, oil, machinery exhaust, and any other rubbish seeps into". It is reported that diamond miners are exposed health risks and hazards, including [[malaria]], [[dysentery]], [[cholera]] and [[sexual diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yakovleva|first=Natalia|title=Corporate social responsibility in the mining industries|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2005|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CDqXX_28lkC | isbn=978-0-7546-4268-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to those diseases, child labourers who are subjected to working in poor conditions including overcrowding, abuse, long work hours and cheap pay in diamond mines suffer from [[eye strain]], [[headache]]s, [[malnutrition]], and respiratory problems. While they are paid for how many diamonds they can polish or cut per day. The ordinary amount of money a worker will get for polishing the uppermost section of a diamond is two [[rupee]]s, which is below eight US [[Cent (United States coin)|cent]]s, while workers who make smaller diamonds, might be paid 15 to 20 [[US dollar]]s per week. Child slaves in [[Surat]] sleep in their workplace or in a small hovel instead of a home. The [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] has claimed that child labour was prospering in the diamond industry in Western India, where the majority of the world's diamonds are cut and polished while workers are often paid only a fraction of 1% of the value of the stones they cut in 1997.&lt;ref name=BBCBusiness/&gt;

Child workers are used as slaves since business owners exploit them as cheap employment to raise more profit and diamond industry is "an infamous venue of exploitation towards youth workers" like mines and sweatshops in South Africa or India while the diamond is overpriced and funded for wars. The majority of the [[third world country]] families are [[Poverty|poor]] therefore rely on their children’s income to survive. Additionally since most children do not have the opportunity to gain an education from their local school system, working at a [[sweatshop]] is their only option in life.&lt;ref name=sciencedirect/&gt;&lt;ref name=ihscslnews/&gt; In other instances, employers pays the family in advance and in turn, the child works to pay off the debt, which is called bonding, yet bonded children cannot pay their family’s debt because of interest. With the increase in owed money, bonded children are forced into a life of servitude which will pass onto their descendants.

On the other hand, Civil wars usually shut down all government services. Countries like [[Sierra Leone]], which depend on [[diamond]]s for much of its economic activity, not only face disruption in production (which reduces the supply), but also a thriving [[black market]] in [[conflict diamond]]s, which drives down the price for what diamonds are produced.

== Forceful relocation of indigenous Bushman people by DeBeers ==

When the mines are located on the land indigenous people including children, they had to be moved to a different area in order to construct a mine to collect gems.&lt;ref name=ihscslnews/&gt; In [[Botswana]], a long dispute has existed between the interests of the mining company, [[De Beers]], and the [[Population transfer|relocation]] of the [[bushmen|Bushman]] [[tribe]] from the land in order to explore diamond resources. The Bushmen have been facing threats from government policies since at least 1980, when the diamond resources were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.survival-international.org/tribes/bushmen The Bushmen Need You]&lt;/ref&gt; A campaign is being fought in an attempt to bring an end to what [[Survival International]] considers to be a "[[genocide]]" of a tribe that has been living in those lands for tens of thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2919089/De-Beers-battles-with-Survival.html |title=De Beers battles with Survival |work=Telegraph |date=2005-07-17 |accessdate=2009-07-23 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2793779.stm |title=Bushmen 'moved for diamonds' |publisher=BBC news |date=2003-02-24 |accessdate=2009-07-23 | first=Alastair | last=Leithead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2005-07-08-botswana-diamonds-lose-their-sparkle |title=Botswana diamonds lose their sparkle |work=Mail and Guardian |date=2005-07-08 |accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the grounds that their hunting and gathering has become "obsolete" and their presence is no longer compatible with "preserving [[wildlife]] resources", they were persecuted by the government in order to make them leave the [[nature reserve|reserve]].

{{Main|Diamonds from Sierra Leone}}

On 4 July 2005 [[United States|American]] [[hip hop music|rap]] star [[Kanye West]], released a song titled [[Diamonds from Sierra Leone]] as the lead single of his second studio album, ''[[Late Registration]]'',&lt;ref name=linernotes&gt;{{cite AV media notes |others=Kanye West |title=Late Registration |year=2005 |publisher=Roc-A-Fella Records |id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing a repeated sample of the [[theme song]] for the 1971 [[James Bond]] film, ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' as performed by [[Shirley Bassey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/10/29/shirley_bassey_wants_to_work_with_kanye_ |title=Shirley Bassey Wants To Work With Kanye West |accessdate=2007-10-29 |author=World Entertainment News Network |date=2007-10-29 |work=Starpulsec.com |publisher=Starpulse}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song is revealing the hard life of child workers in Sierra Leone, like other [[West African]] nations who since 1991 having been forced to mine [[conflict diamonds]] and die in [[civil war]]s financed by them: "''Good Morning! This ain't Vietnam. Still, people lose hands, legs, arms for real/Little was known of Sierra Leone, and how it connect to the diamonds we own...''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Crosley, Hillary|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1504091/20050614/index.jhtml?headlines=true |title='Diamonds' Remix: Kanye Raps About Rocks, Jay Raps About Roc |accessdate=2005-06-14 |author2=Aswad, Jem |date=2005-06-14 |work=[[MTV]] |publisher=[[MTV Networks]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[music video]] was directed by [[Hype Williams]] and shot entirely in black-and-white in Prague,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1502507/20050517/west_kanye.jhtml |title=Kanye West Shooting 'Diamonds' Video In 'Pray-Goo' |accessdate=2005-05-17 |author=Reid, Shaheem |date=2005-05-17 |work=MTV |publisher=MTV Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring visuals of young African children toiling away in mines under the careful watch of their wardens with juxtaposed with scenes of wealthy Westerners shopping in boutiques and trying on jewellery.

The song peaked at number forty-three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], was moderately successful on the [[iTunes]] music service, and peaked in the eight spot on the [[UK Top 40]]. It won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance|Best Rap Song]] at the [[48th Grammy Awards]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2485">The '''Conseil national du patronat français''' ('''CNPF'''; '''National Council of French Employers''') was an [[employers' organization]] created in December 1945 on request of the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]], which wanted a representative organization of all of the employers. 

==Origins==

On 27 July 1944 the Free French government in [[Algiers]] annulled the Vichy decrees, dissolved the [[Peasant Corporation]] (Corporation paysanne) and reestablished all the syndicates of 1939 apart from the [[Confédération générale du patronat français]] (CGPF), which represented employers.{{sfn|Chronologie : histoire des relations du travail ...}}
The ''Centre des juenes patrons'' (CJP) helped organize the CNPF in 1944, as did various leading employers with modern and civic-minded views.{{sfn|Zølner|2009|p=97}}
[[Henri Lafond]] worked with Pierre Ricard and Henri Davezac to form the CNPF.
[[Georges Villiers]] was the first president.{{sfn|Mahl}}

==History==

A division soon appeared between those such as Lafond who felt employers deserved certain rights, which should be regulated by law, and those who were opposed to any diminution of the absolute authority of the patron.
The latter group included Marcel Meunier (1893–1971), a declared paternalist who became head of the CNPF social commission.{{sfn|Zølner|2009|p=97}}
Under the initiative of [[Ernest-Antoine Seillière]], the CNPF transformed itself in 1998 into the MEDEF ([[Mouvement des Entreprises de France]]).

[[File:Rialto Theater-Tacoma.jpg|thumb|The Rialto Theater, in the heart of downtown Tacoma]]
'''Downtown Tacoma''' is approximately bounded by east-west by A Street and Tacoma Avenue, and north-south by South 7th Street and South 25th Street, in the inner Northeast section of [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]].  The center of downtown is the intersection of 9th and Broadway.  The city [[Christmas tree]] is located here as well.

== Downtown ==
Downtown Tacoma's mid-century downturn was exacerbated by the opening of the Tacoma Mall on May 16, 1968.  Many of the anchor retail stores left the downtown to relocate to the mall.

== Revitalization efforts and progress ==
Following the exodus of retailers to the [[Tacoma Mall]] in the late 1960s, city leadership attempted to make downtown more appealing to shoppers by building two large parking garages and by closing off to traffic two blocks of Broadway Street between South 9th and South 11th Streets.  The Broadway Mall was less successful than hoped and the street was re-opened to traffic during the 1980s.

Later revitalization efforts were centered around the renovation of Union Station in 1990, which became Tacoma's federal courthouse, coupled with the opening of [[University of Washington Tacoma]]. The University of Washington rejected a greenfield site for its new South Puget Sound campus and, instead, decided to restore six historic warehouses in a dilapidated district on the edge of downtown Tacoma. Today, the area is a thriving museum and university district. Retail and restaurants have returned and downtown is undergoing a renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = McMahon|first = E. T.|date = 2000|title = School sprawl.|url =|journal = Planning Commissioners Journal|issue = 39|pages = 16–18|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of the [[Museum of Glass]], [[Tacoma Art Museum]], and the [[Washington State History Museum]] added much life to the area.

The Tacoma City Council passed the Local Improvement District for St. Helens Street in April 2006 which was designed to improve areas which have been neglected.  The LID is expected to start in 2008.  Also central to the revitalization effort has been the city's adoption of the [[tax exemption]] for new residential units in multifamily dwellings, primarily apartments and condominiums.  Starting in 2002, downtown Tacoma began seeing an increase in the number of residential units being built or renovated downtown.  Buildings such as the Perkins Building, Harmon Lofts, and Cliff Street were renovated for living units.

A new regional [[convention center]], the [[Greater Tacoma Convention and Trade Center]], opened in 2004.

== Historic buildings ==
Downtown Tacoma is well known for historic buildings most built at the end of the 19th century.  The buildings include the Old City Hall Building, Union Station, Elks Temple, Bostwick Building, the Winthrop Hotel and the Pythian Temple, which houses [[Seabury School#Middle school|Seabury Middle School]].  The Mecca Theater is currently being restored.

'''Ebenezer Cooke''' (14 May 1832 – 7 May 1907)&lt;ref name=parl/&gt; was a [[South Australia]]n accountant, Member of Parliament and Commissioner of Audit.

Cooke was born in [[London]], [[England]] where his eldest brother, the Rev. John Cooke, was a noted Egyptologist&lt;ref name=obit1&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article57507425 Death of Mr. E. Cooke] ''South Australian Register'' 8 May 1907 p.5 accessed 10 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founder of ''The Freeman'', a Baptist weekly newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/bq/27-2_050.pdf Taylor, Rosemary ''English Baptist Periodicals, 1790-1865''] pp. 72, 73 accessed 10 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accountant==
In 1863 Ebenezer Cooke was sent out to the colony of South Australia by the [[English and Australian Copper Company]] as accountant for their smelting works in St. Vincent Street, [[Port Adelaide, South Australia|Port Adelaide]]. He took on role of superintendent then (on the death of general manager James Hamilton in 1871&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article39256680 Mr. James Hamilton] ''South Australian Register'' 12 August 1871 Supplement p.7 accessed 11 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;) was officially appointed to that position,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article39241774/3958380 English and Australian Copper Company] ''South Australian Register'' 26 December 1871 p.5 accessed 11 November 2011&lt;br&gt;Includes some incidental information about the company, which handled the massive output from the Burra mines.&lt;/ref&gt; which he held until [[recruiter|"headhunted"]] by the Public Service in 1882. He was replaced by Frederick Ireland who, like Cooke, was promoted from the post of Accountant.

==Politics==
On 1 March 1875 he was elected to the [[South Australian House of Assembly]] as member for [[Electoral district of Flinders|Flinders]],&lt;ref name=parl&gt;
{{cite SA-parl
 |pid=3579
 |name=Ebenezer Cooke
 |accessdate=7 January 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt; encompassing northern towns such as [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]] and [[Port Pirie, South Australia|Port Pirie]] with colleagues [[Patrick Boyce Coglin]] and [[John Williams (South Australian politician)|John Williams]]. In 1878 he was re-elected for the same district, with [[William Ranson Mortlock]] taking the place of Williams. In 1881 Cooke was once more successful, his fellow-members being Mortlock and A. Tennant.
:"During these years Mr. Cooke was a most regular attendant in the House, and he developed a reputation as an analyst of budget speeches. He was not fond of debating ordinary subjects, but when matters were before the House in which financial questions were involved Mr. Cooke was listened to with the utmost attention by all parties, because he used to study his subjects so fully and seemed to be able to fathom every point involved. His attention to detail became almost wearisome at times, but it all went to prove the true value of the man as a student of financial subjects."&lt;ref name=obit2/&gt;
On 31 July 1879 he was appointed chairman of the Royal Commission on Finance, which ran for nearly three years. The Commission's final report, dated 2 May 1882, recommended the creation of an Audit Office with two Commissioners of Audit. These recommendations were accepted with Cooke and Alfred Heath appointed to the top jobs. This necessitated his retirement from parliament; he resigned on 24 October 1882,&lt;ref name=obit2&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5064446 Death of Mr. E. Clarke] ''Advertiser (Adelaide)'' 8 May 1907 p.7 accessed 10 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; though he did retain the position of attorney for the English and Australian Copper Company and directorship of the related English Copper Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43464496 Government Defeat on the Audit Bill] ''South Australian Register'' 11 July 1883 p.4 accessed 11 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government Auditor==
He took up the post in February 1883. He and Heath (who had been appointed to counterbalance Cooke's suspected political loyalties) worked harmoniously and efficiently,&lt;ref name=obit1/&gt; but when Heath retired (or was relieved of his position), Cooke continued in the role alone with no obvious reduction in the Office's effectiveness. He
:"possessed uncommon gifts as a mathematician, a vein of dry humour, he was well informed on all current topics, with a particularly good knowledge of the political history of the State and of Australia centrally and, tbough he at one time took a prominent part in public affairs, and discussed with avidity questioned before Parliament, after his induction to the control of the Audit Office he 'knew no politics'"&lt;ref name=obit1/&gt;
Under his leadership, the Audit Office evolved from an investigative body to a powerful arm of Government, giving advice, and to some extent control, outside its original remit.
He supported the formation of the Public Service Association in 1884, and was its first president.

==Family==
He was the brother of Rev. J. Hunt Cooke of [[Richmond, Surrey]].
He married Eliza Peyton (née  Ogden) (c. 1833 – 16 April 1865) in London in 1859. Their children were

Stezl, shipping agents of [[Melbourne (Victoria)|Melbourne]]. He married Ada Grace Rosetta Collins of [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]] on 8 March 1893 and had two daughters. He was a keen mathematician and the author of ''The A.B.C. Perpetual Calendar'' (1920).&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59013714 Obituary] ''South Australian Register'' 12 July 1924 p.14 accessed 12 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10079">'''Ethics in mathematics''' is a field of [[applied ethics]], the inquiry into ethical aspects of the applications of [[mathematics]]. It deals with the professional responsibilities of [[mathematicians]] whose work influences decisions with major consequences, such as in law, finance, the military, and environmental science.

==Need for ethics in the mathematics profession==
Mathematicians in industrial, scientific, military and intelligence roles crucially influence decisions with large consequences. For example, complex calculations were needed for the success of the [[Manhattan Project]], while the overextended use of the [[Copula (probability theory)|Gaussian copula]] formula to price derivatives before the [[Global Financial Crisis]] of 2008 has been called "the formula that killed Wall Street",&lt;ref&gt;Felix Salmon, [https://www.wired.com/2009/02/wp-quant/ Recipe for disaster: the formula that killed Wall Street"], ''Wired''23 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and the theory of global warming depends on the reliability of [[climate models|mathematical models of climate]]. For the same reason as in [[medical ethics]] and [[engineering ethics]], the high impact of the consequences of decisions imposes serious ethical obligations on practitioners to consider the rights and wrongs of their advice and decisions.

==Disasters and scandals involving the use of mathematics==
These illustrate the major consequences of numerical mistakes and hence the need for ethical care.
* The [[Club of Rome]]'s 1972 mathematical-model based predictions in ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' of widespread collapse of the world system by the end of the century.
* [[Sally Clark|Wrongful conviction of Sally Clark]] (1999), An English solicitor, Sally Clark, was wrongfully convicted of murdering her two children – each of whom had died due to [[sudden infant death syndrome]] – due to a fundamental statistical error in the testimony of an "expert".&lt;br&gt;The error was further compounded by the "[[prosecutor's fallacy]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1432762/Misleading-statistics-were-presented-as-facts-in-Sally-Clark-trial.html Derbyshire, D., "Misleading statistics were presented as facts in Sally Clark trial", ''The Telegraph'', (12 June 2003).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical issues in the mathematical profession==
Mathematicians in professional roles in finance and similar work have a particular responsibility to ensure they use the best methods and data to reach the right answer, as the prestige of mathematics is high and others rely on mathematical results which they cannot fully understand. Other ethical issues are shared with [[information economy]] professionals in general, such as [[duty of care]], [[confidentiality]] of information, [[whistleblowing]], and avoiding [[conflict of interest]].

==Misuse of statistics==
{{Main|Misuse of statistics}}
Much of mathematics as used in applications involves the drawing of conclusions from quantitative data. It is recognised that there are many difficulties in reaching and communicating such conclusions accurately, honestly and with due regard to the uncertainties that remain. It is easy for a statistician to mislead clients whose understanding of data and inference is less developed, so statisticians have professional responsibilities to act fairly.

==Ethics in pure mathematical research==
The [[American Mathematical Society]] publishes a code of ethical guidelines for mathematical researchers. The responsibilities of researchers include being knowledgeable in the field, avoiding plagiarism and giving credit, to publish without unreasonable delay, and to correct errors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/about-us/governance/policy-statements/sec-ethics American Mathematical Society Policy Statement on Ethical Guidelines], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Mathematical Society]] Ethics Committee also publishes a code of practice relating to the publication, editing and refereeing of research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://euro-math-soc.eu/system/files/uploads/COP-approved.pdf Code of Practice – European Mathematical Society].&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that as pure mathematical research is relatively harmless, it raises few urgent ethical issues.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Reuben Hersh]], [http://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1068&amp;context=hmnj Mathematics and ethics], ''The Mathematical Intelligencer'' 12 (3) (1990), 13–15.&lt;/ref&gt; However, that raises the question of whether and why pure mathematics is ethically worth doing, given that it consumes the lives of many highly intelligent people who could be making more immediately useful contributions.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Franklin (philosopher)|James Franklin]], [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF03024064 Ethics of mathematics], ''Mathematical Intelligencer'' 13 (1) (1991), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching ethics in mathematics==
Courses in the ethics of mathematics remain rare. The [[University of New South Wales]] taught a compulsory course on Professional Issues and Ethics in Mathematics in its mathematics degrees from 1998 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;James Franklin, [http://www.austms.org.au/Publ/Gazette/2005/May05/franklin.pdf A “Professional issues and ethics in mathematics” course], ''Gazette of the Australian Mathematical Society'' 32 (2005), 98–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''eyeBeam''' is a [[VoIP]] [[softphone]] for [[Windows]] that uses [[Session Initiation Protocol]] to facilitate voice, video conferencing and instant messaging. [[X-Lite]] 3.0 is based on the eyeBeam codebase, but with a more limited set of capabilities.

eyeBeam was launched on September 13, 2004 for [[Windows]] as [[Vancouver]]-based CounterPath Corporation's first video capable softphone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.counterpath.com/xten-adds-full-motion-video-to-voip-with-new-sip-softphone-eyebeam.html |title=Xten Adds Full Motion Video to VoIP With New SIP Softphone – eyeBeam |publisher=CounterPath.com |date=2004-09-13|accessdate=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A version for [[Macintosh|Mac]] followed shortly after on October 20, 2004 but was discontinued in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.counterpath.com/xten-launches-eyebeam-voip-softphone-for-mac-os-x-and-announces-500000-sip-softphones-deployed.html |title=Xten Launches eyeBeam VoIP Softphone for Mac OS X and Announces 500,000 SIP Softphones Deployed |publisher=CounterPath.com |date=2004-10-20 |accessdate=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Updates for eyeBeam 1.5 ended in or before March, 2015 and the product will no longer be available for sale after March 31, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.counterpath.com/eyebeam/|title=End of Sale Notice|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-07|quote=CounterPath is issuing notice that eyeBeam will no longer be sold on the CounterPath Store after March 31, 2018.

The company manufactures building block chemicals that go into the making of a host of other chemicals needed to make various [[Product (business)|consumer products]]. It starts with a naphtha cracker, yielding [[propylene]] and [[ethylene]], which are the raw materials in the production of all manner of [[polymer]]s. Hanwha Total divides its operations in three: polymer production ([[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], high- and [[Low density polyethylene|low-density polyethylene]]), base chemicals (selling the ethylene and propylene the company doesn't use itself, as well as aromatics used to make the materials that go into [[synthetic fiber]]s), and oil products (jet, diesel, gasoline,...)&lt;ref name="hoovers.com"/&gt;

Hanwha Total Petrochemicals is headquartered in [[Seoul|Seoul, South Korea]], but operates a large [[petrochemical]] complex, consisting of 13 separate plants, at Daesan, in Korea’s [[Chungcheongnam-do|Chungnam Province]].&lt;ref name="samsungtotal.com"/&gt; The partnership employs 1100 people.

Hanwha Total's headquarters are located at Daesan, the [[South Chungcheong Province]] in [[South Korea]].
And in addition, PP, PE compounding plant was at Dongkwan in [[China]]. Sales offices are operated in [[Seoul]], [[Busan]], [[Daegu]], [[Gwangju]] and [[Daejeon]].

'''Harry Fett''' (8 September 1875 &amp;ndash; 13 September 1962) was a Norwegian [[art historian]] and factory owner. He headed the [[Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage]] from 1913 to 1946.

==Personal life==
[[File:Chriistinehall3.JPG|right|thumb|250 px|Christinedal, Harry Fetts vei 10, the home of Harry Fett]]
Fett was born in [[Oslo|Christiania]] as the son of factory owner Frans Eduard Fett and Ester Carolina Emilia Fischer. He was married to Harriet Emilie Trepka Rode from 1903.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Harry Fett |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Dag |last=Myklebust |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Harry_Fett/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Fett finished his [[examen artium]] in 1894. He then carried through a European study tour which lasted four years, visiting Germany and Italy. During these studies he was particularly influenced by the art historians Wilhelm Vöge and [[Adolf Furtwängler]]. Back in Norway he was appointed secretary of the [[Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments]]. While in this position Fett carried out a large documentary work on church art from the Middle Ages throughout the country. He also did work for the [[Norwegian Museum of Cultural History]]. In 1908 he delivered his doctoral thesis, ''Billedhuggerkunsten i Norge under Sverreætten''. After the death of his father in 1911, he took over as manager for the family company, including the factories Høyenhall Fabrikker.

On August 22, 2016, Mashaba was elected [[City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality|Mayor of Johannesburg]] by the first sitting of council following countrywide local government elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/live-city-of-johannesburg-inaugural-council-meeting-20160822|title=LIVE: Mayor Mashaba - Corruption is public enemy number 1|work=News24|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career==
Mashaba was brought up in near-poverty in GaRamotse in [[Hammanskraal]], Gauteng, by his sisters while his absent domestic-worker mother worked to provide for the family.

His older brother dropped out of school at 15, going from one unsubstantial job to another. Mashaba realised that an education would be crucial for him to break out of the cycle of poverty. He graduated from high school, but did not complete his tertiary education.

From a young age he was a strategic thinker - he bought a car without having a license and drove out of the dealership without ever having learned to drive. He drove himself from one selling job to another, in the process confirming for himself that he was a natural salesman with an unswerving instinct for business. He started selling "SuperKurl" African hair-care products and became their number-one earner.  He soon realised that these products excited him and that he wasn't content to be just an employee. (Reference: Book titled "South Africa's Greatest Entrepreneurs", compiled by Moky Makura, article written by Isabella Morris)

His company, "Black Like Me", was launched on Valentine’s Day in 1985 with a {{currency|amount=30000|code=ZAR}} loan from his friend, businessman Walter Dube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/the-star/story-of-black-like-me-and-the-man-behind-it-1297341#.VYsMfflVikp|title=Story of Black Like Me, and the man behind it {{!}} The Star|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;



Mashaba is also a music lover. After five years of secret lessons, he revealed himself as a pianist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://city-press.news24.com/News/on-the-streets-with-herman-mashaba-20160313|title=On the streets with Herman Mashaba|work=CityPress|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
From 2012 until May 2014, Mashaba served as chairman of the [[Free Market Foundation]] (FMF).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.moneyweb.co.za/news/economy/anc-policies-keeping-black-people-poor-says-herman-mashaba/|title=ANC policies keeping black people poor, says Herman Mashaba|last=Ziady|first=Hanna|date=2016-02-05|work=Moneyweb|access-date=2017-05-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stepped down from his position when he joined the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] as an "ordinary card-carrying member", citing the need for the Foundation to remain politically impartial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.moneyweb.co.za/archive/herman-mashaba-to-join-the-da/|title=FMF chairman steps down to join the DA|date=2014-05-28|work=Moneyweb|access-date=2017-05-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mashaba announced in December 2015 that he would accept a nomination to stand as a [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] mayoral candidate for the [[City of Johannesburg]] in the 2016 local government elections. The other possible DA candidate was [[Rabelani Dagada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/herman-mashaba-announced-as-das-joburg-mayoral-candidate-20160116|title=Herman Mashaba announced as DA's Joburg mayoral candidate|work=News24|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mayor of Johannesburg ===
In the municipal election on August 3, 2016, the ruling party, The [[African National Congress]], lost their majority in Johannesburg, taking only 44.12% of the vote with the Democratic alliance taking 38.33%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elections.org.za/content/LGEPublicReports/402/Detailed%20Results/GP/JHB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Democratic Alliance entered into conversations with the [[Economic Freedom Fighters]] to form a coalition. Whilst the EFF declined the offer, they agreed that they would vote for Mashaba as the Mayor for Johannesburg, despite misgivings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/elections/news/eff-will-vote-for-mashaba-says-malema-20160818|title=EFF will vote for Mashaba, says Malema|work=News24|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 22, 2016, Mashaba was sworn in as a Johannesburg City Councillor. Later that day, he was sworn in as the Mayor of Johannesburg, the first non-ANC Johannesburg mayor since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ewn.co.za/2016/08/22/Victory-for-DA-as-Herman-Mashaba-is-elected-Mayor-of-Johannesburg|title=Victory for DA as Herman Mashaba is elected Mayor of Johannesburg|last=Manyathela|first=Clement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Labour ===
Mashaba has characterised the ANC's post-Apartheid labour laws as "draconian".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He led a Constitutional Court challenge by the FMF, arguing that Section 32 of the Labour Relations Act is unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The FMF argued that the bargaining council process reduces competition, as smaller businesses may not be able to afford the higher wages agreed on between larger businesses and unions, contributing further to South Africa's unemployment rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.moneyweb.co.za/archive/collusion-in-labour-legislation-decisionmaking/|title=Collusion in labour legislation decision-making|last=Radebe|first=Kentse|date=2013-03-05|work=Moneyweb|access-date=2017-05-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, in conjunction with his partners Dmitriy Korzhev and Dmitriy Troitskiy in [[St Petersburg]], Hillar established Multon, a juice manufacturing company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://multon.ru/company/history/ «Мултон».

The '''Hobart Building''' is an office [[high rise]] located at 582–592 [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]], near [[Montgomery Street|Montgomery]] and 2nd Streets, in the [[Financial District (San Francisco)|financial district]] of [[San Francisco, California]]. It was completed in 1914 after only eleven months, which led to accusations that it had been constructed with a degree of recklessness.&lt;ref name="corbett"&gt;{{cite book| last=Corbett | first=Michael R. | title=Splendid Survivors: San Francisco's Downtown Architectural Heritage | publisher=California Living Books | date=1979 | pages=81 | isbn=978-0-89395-031-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at the time the second tallest building in the city, at 21 floors and {{Convert|87|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="emporis"/&gt; It was designed by [[Willis Polk]].

The building was constructed for the Hobart Estate Company on the site of the company's previous offices. The location was reportedly chosen by founder Walter S. Hobart in the 1880s for its prominent location at the head of 2nd Street, originally one of the city's major streets leading to the fashionable [[Rincon Hill, San Francisco|Rincon Hill]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pacific Coast Architect |volume=Vol. 8 (Nov. 1914) |pages=178–182 |publisher=J.

He now resides in [[London]], UK where he has a portfolio of businesses including independent media, energy, commercial and residential property interests.

==Early life and career==
He was born in [[Guria]] in Georgia on 30 January 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=194431772&amp;trk=tab_pro LinkedIn Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 he graduated from [[Tbilisi State University]] and is a doctor of Economic Science. During his time as an undergraduate he spent eighteen months in the army undertaking national service.

He started his career with the City Council of Tbilisi as the director of the youth organisation, Union of the Young.

In 1995, Chkhartishvili was an accredited Specialist Economist consultant to the World Bank's research report by Patrick Conway on post-Soviet transition economies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1995/09/01/000009265_3961019142654/additional/121521322_20041117175047.pdf World Bank - Saving in Transition Economies report, September 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ministerial and Parliamentary career in Georgia==
In 1999 Chkhartishvili was appointed the Deputy of State, a ministerial position he held for a year in which he played a key role in negotiating with the [[International Monetary Fund]] in meetings between September 1999 and January 2000 for ongoing support to reform the economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adlib.imf.org/digital_assets/wwwopac.ashx?command=getcontent&amp;server=webdocs&amp;value=EB/2000/SM/29716.PDF Georgia - IMF Staff  Report  for  the  1999 Article  IV  Consultation, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of the economic team to oversee the completion of the [[Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline]] contract, which was approved by the presidents of Georgia, Azerbaijan and Turkey in November 1999. Between 1999 and 2000, Chkhartishvili oversaw economic improvements with the high inflation rate of 19% reduced to 4.1%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=gg&amp;v=71 Index Mundi report - Inflation rate in Georgia]&lt;/ref&gt; and the population living below the poverty line falling from 60% in 1999 to 54% in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?v=69&amp;c=gg&amp;l=en Index Mundi report - Population below poverty line in Georgia]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2000, Chkhartishvili was part of the Georgian delegation that travelled to Moscow to successfully negotiate a resumption of gas supplies to Georgia after they had been cut by Itera, the Russian gas company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailyreportonrussia.net/archives/2000/04/4-28-00.htm Daily Report on Russia, Itera To Resume Supplies To Georgia, 28 April 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chkhartishvili was then appointed by President [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] as the Minister of the Economy, Industry and Trade (later renamed [[Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development]]). In June 2001, Chkhartishvili brought to fruition a project to develop a joint Georgian-Italian leasing company to assist in nurturing small and medium enterprises in Georgia. Chkhartishvili secured an initial investment of $350,000 from BNL Bank of Italy and other Italian investors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2007/04/25/000310607_20070425125248/Rendered/PDF/395860lc1161en.pdf International Finance Corporation (World Bank) Bulletin July-August 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2001, Chkhartishvili voiced concerns about corruption and urged an increase in the country's budget.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=244 Government meeting of Georgia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=235 President Favoured Budget Project for 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; He highlighted that the average Georgian businessman was paying 233 lari ($115) in bribes every month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iwpr.net/report-news/shevardnadze-hounds-corrupt-ministers Shevardnadze Hounds Corrupt Ministers]&lt;/ref&gt; Chkhartishvili was involved in a bitter dispute with the Minister of Justice, [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], over the summer of 2001, which led to his opposition to Saakashvili's reign as President. As the internal tensions continued inside Government, Chkhartishvili left the Government to concentrate on his business affairs.

In June 2002, Chkhartishvili successfully sued officials who had made allegations of corruption against him. The Supreme Court of Georgia positively ruled in his favour to exonerate him of the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=2159 Ex-Economy Minister Wins Libel Suit Against Civil Activist]&lt;/ref&gt; He refused any financial compensation and accepted the apology.

From 2004 to 2008, he was a Member of the Georgian Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.ge/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=678:parliament-of-georgia-2004-2008&amp;catid=58:previous-parliaments-of-georgia&amp;Itemid=145&amp;lang=en Parliament of Georgia 2004-2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the election, he was elected Chairman of the parliamentary caucus, the Independent Majoritarians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=6750 4 Parliamentary Factions Set Up]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2004, he was appointed&lt;ref&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/AssemblyList/AL_MemberDetails.asp?MemberID=5398&amp;CountryID=16 Council of Europe Profile 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; as Deputy Representative for Georgia to the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc04/FDOC10208.htm Report to the Council of Europe President, 19 June 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Georgian Parliament in December 2004, after an investigation found the previous Government of Georgia responsible for the devaluation of deposits that affected some savers in the country and pointedly cleared Chkhartishvili of any responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sarke.com/cgi/search/search.asp?Page=5&amp;Search=devaluation Sarke Information Agency 28 December 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, Chkhartishvili was part of a high level delegation that met with a Polish parliamentary delegation in Tbilisi aimed at strengthening democratic governance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krzysztoflisek.pl/aktualnosci/czytaj/83/posel-krzysztof-lisek-czlonkiem-delegacji-polskiego-parlamentu-w-gruzji.html Interparliamentary conference 29 November to 2 December 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chkhartishvili backed the resolution in 2007 at the Council of Europe's Committee on Economic Affairs and Development to pursue 'a vision that combines economic growth and social protection in the new economic world'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc07/EDOC11366.htm Realising both economic growth and social protection in Europe in an era of globalisation, 9 August 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; and a further resolution to improve support for prudent financial management to avoid the 'collapse' of the Council of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc07/EDOC11371.htm Political dimension of the Council of Europe budget, 12 September 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; In his final parliamentary year in 2008, he backed the Council of Europe's budget of 'additional resources allocated to the [[European Court of Human Rights]]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc08/EDOC11599.htm Budgets of the Council of Europe for the financial year 2009, 25 April 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Chkhartishvili also supported in the Council of Europe, the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) goals 'to promote peace, security, democracy and good governance' in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc08/EDOC11636.htm Mobilising parliaments for Africa’s Development, 26 June 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1995 to 2002 he was first the Founder and later the Chairman and shareholder of the United Georgian Bank (UGB).
In 2003, Chkhartishvili, became the Founder of [[Mze TV]] and publicly complained about the apparent smear campaign against him made by the rival TV station [[Rustavi-2]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-24505493_ITM Prominent Georgian businessman becomes TV company board chairman, 25 September 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dir.groups.yahoo.com/group/RMSMC/message/2957 Georgian Mze TV Head Accuses Rustavi-2 TV of Slander, 29 November 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2006 and 2011, Chkhartishvili was a minority shareholder in SOCAR Energy Georgia supplying petroleum products from Azerbaijan to Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.trend.az/capital/energy/919266.html#popup Info Georgian MP Shares Quarter of Stock of SOCAR Georgia Petroleum]&lt;/ref&gt;

The court emphatically found in favour of judgement of Chkhartishvili and dismissed the claims by stating '''The injunctions are discharged and will not be continued.  There will be summary judgment for Vano on the claim.'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eccourts.org/judgments/decisions/2012/HC/tvi/InnaGudavadzeetalvCarlinaOverseasCorpetal.pdf CLAIM NO: BVIHC (COM) 2012/0011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Low has been associated with numerous dubious high value transactions, including acquisitions of businesses, luxury real estate and art, as well as philanthropy.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

== Early life ==
Low grew up in [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], on [[Penang Island]]. His grandfather Low Meng Tak was a businessman born in [[Guangdong]] in China.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/scion-moves-into-spotlight-on-global-m-a-stage-1413915617|title = Scion Moves into Spotlight on M&amp;A Stage|last = Farrell|first = Maureen|date = 21 October 2014|access-date = |newspaper = The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meng Tak had interests in iron-ore mining and liquor distilleries in [[Thailand]] in the 1960s and 1970s, and in real estate in Thailand, Malaysia and [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Jho Low's father [[Malay styles and titles|Tan Sri]] Larry Low Hock Peng founded investment holding company MWE Holdings.&lt;ref name="firstint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/story/?file=%2f2010%2f7%2f29%2fnation%2f6756946&amp;sec=nation|title=A millionaire before graduating|work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|date=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2014/11/01/low-family-fortune-first-built-on-ironore-mining/|title=Low family fortune first built on iron-ore mining - Business News {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low was the youngest of three children. He attended [[Chung Ling High School]] and [[The International School of Penang (Uplands)]] before being sent to the elite [[Harrow School]] in London.&lt;ref name="firstint"/&gt; In London, he developed a "close relationship" with [[Riza Aziz]], the stepson of former [[Malaysian Prime Minister]] [[Najib Razak]].&lt;ref&gt;Story, Louise and Stephanie Saul.

Low can speak [[Malay language|Malay]], English, [[Cantonese]], [[Hokkien]] and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]].&lt;ref name="firstint" /&gt;

== Business dealings and wealth ==
Although earlier in his career, Low had often claimed to be investing and making purchases on behalf of other investors or "friends", in 2015 Low suggested that his family had considerable independent means.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; While a 2015 New York Times article suggested that his family was of "somewhat deflated affluence,"&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; a 2014 Wall Street Journal profile had called him a "scion."

=== Career ===
Low's first major deal was the [[Kuwait Finance House]]'s 2006 purchase for US$87&amp;nbsp;million of a luxury [[high-rise]] apartment building in [[Kuala Lumpur]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to the New York Times, "[b]y 2007, [Low] had formed an investment group that included a Malaysian prince, a Kuwaiti sheikh and a friend from the [[United Arab Emirates]] who went on to become ambassador to the United States and Mexico."&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; By 2010, the family had consolidated its fortune into Jynwel Capital, of which Low and older brother Szen Low were the principal stewards.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As steward of Jynwel, Low cultivated relationships with some of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds, including [[Abu Dhabi]]'s [[Mubadala Development Co]] and the [[Kuwait Investment Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysia-today.net/jho-low-back-in-the-limelight/|author=Super Admin|title=JHO LOW BACK IN THE LIMELIGHT|publisher=[[Malaysia Today]]|date=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jynwel is connected with deals including the acquisition of New York's [[Park Lane Hotel (Manhattan)|Park Lane Hotel]] for US$660&amp;nbsp;million in 2013 with The Witkoff Group and Mubadala; the takeover of Coastal Energy in 2014 for US$2.2&amp;nbsp;billion; and the buyout of [[EMI]]'s music publishing business in 2012 for US$2.2&amp;nbsp;billion with the [[Blackstone Group]], [[Sony Corporation]] and Mubadala.&lt;ref name="rpjl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therakyatpost.com/business/2014/10/22/jho-low-jynwel-capital-move-global-deal-spotlight-supported-wealthy-abu-dhabi-funds/|title=Jho Low, Jynwel Capital move into global deal spotlight supported by wealthy Abu Dhabi Funds|work=The Rakyat Post|date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low was the architect for Jynwel Capital's unsuccessful US$2.2&amp;nbsp;billion bid to buy [[Reebok]] from [[Adidas AG]] in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therakyatpost.com/business/2014/10/20/abu-dhabi-bid-reebok/|title=Jynwel Capital, led by Jho Low, and Abu Dhabi Funds seek to buy Reebok from Adidas|work=The Rakyat Post|date=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low advises Aziz in the management of [[Red Granite Pictures]], a Hollywood production company responsible for films such as ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|Wolf of Wall Street]]'' and ''[[Dumb and Dumber To]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Story, Louise and Stephanie Saul.

=== 1MDB allegations ===
{{main|1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal}} 
Najib Razak gained the post of Malaysian Prime Minister in 2009.  Soon, he became president of the board of advisers for [[1MDB]], the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund.  Although Low never received an official position, he admits that he occasionally "consulted" with 1MDB, and was involved in a number of transactions connecting his own interests with those of 1MDB.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Malaysian Financier Jho Low Tied to 1MDB Inquiry|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/malaysian-financier-tied-to-inquiry-into-1mdb-1436466499|newspaper = The Wall Street Journal|date = 9 July 2015|access-date = 11 July 2015|issn = 0099-9660|first = Tom|last = Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' has reported that a $33.5&amp;nbsp;million condominium in [[Manhattan]] was owned by a shell company under control of Low's family trust, and then was transferred to a shell company controlled by Razak's stepson.&lt;ref name="nyt2"&gt;Story, Louise.

''[[The New York Times]]'' 22 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Another "home in [[Beverly Hills]] known as the pyramid house for a gold pyramid in its garden" was owned by a shell company controlled by the Low family trust, and was transferred to Razak's stepson by simply transferring control of the shell company to him.&lt;ref name="nyt2"/&gt;

In October 2016, [[Interpol]] published a red notice at [[Singapore]]'s request to locate Jho Low in an investigation related to 1MDB fund flows within its jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/06/08/singapore-says-interpol-had-red-notice-out-on-jho-low-in-2016-malaysia-was-aware/|title=Singapore says Interpol had red notice out on Jho Low in 2016, Malaysia was aware - Nation {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Malaysian general election, 2018|Malaysian general election]] in 2018, Malaysia renewed investigations into the [[1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal|1MDB scandal]] and issued arrest warrants against Low and former SRC International director, Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/arrest-warrant-issued-for-jho-low-report|title=Arrest warrant issued for Jho Low: Report|last=hermes|date=2018-06-08|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/06/08/pm-confirms-bid-to-arrest-jho-low-but-he-cant-be-extradited/|title=PM: We know where Jho Low is, we just can’t get to him - Nation {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He organised a free pro-government concert in his home state of Penang,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; featuring American musicians [[Busta Rhymes]] and [[Ludacris]] and was criticised as unfair electioneering by the local, opposition government.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/09/nyregion/jho-low-young-malaysian-has-an-appetite-for-new-york.html|title=Jho Low, Well Connected in Malaysia, Has an Appetite for New York|last=Saul|first=Louise Story and Stephanie|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philanthropy ==
Low's philanthropy began after a reported cancer scare in 2012.&lt;ref name=rpjl/&gt;  He then founded Jynwel Foundation to honour the Low family tradition, started by his grandfather, of financing schools, hospitals and community centres in his hometown. Low's grandfather died from cancer in 2013.&lt;ref name=rpjl/&gt;

In 2013, Jynwel Foundation committed US$50&amp;nbsp;million over 12 years to the [[University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center]], the hospital where Jho Low spent six months recovering from his infection and cancer scare.&lt;ref name=rpjl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdanderson.org/publications/promise/issues/winter-2014/jho-low-gift.html|author=Victor Scott|title=$50&amp;nbsp;million plus world's smartest computer|publisher=[[University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center]]|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funds were to begin a pilot program using [[IBM]]'s [[Watson (computer)|Watson]] [[question answering]] computer system as a [[clinical decision support system]] in cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release | url = https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/42214.wss | publisher = IBM | title = MD Anderson Taps IBM Watson to Power 'Moon Shots' Mission Aimed at Ending Cancer, Starting with Leukemia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2013/10/18/ibms-watson-now-tackles-clinical-trials-at-md-anderson-cancer-center/ | work = Forbes | title = IBM's Watson Now Tackles Clinical Trials at MD Anderson Cancer Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was to acquire, analyse and organise vast amounts of data to help physicians determine the most promising treatments for cancer patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/mind-guest-blog/expert-cancer-care-may-soon-be-everywhere-thanks-to-watson/|author= Rob High and Jho Low|title=Expert Cancer Care May Soon Be Everywhere, Thanks to Watson|work=[[Scientific American]]|date=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low, on behalf of the Jynwel Foundation, underwrote [[Alicia Keys]]' [[Keep A Child Alive]]'s annual flagship fundraiser event in New York City  from 2012 to 2015.  He donated $250,000 to the organisation in 2013 to expand its HIV programs in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303763804579186013306479276|title=Music to Get in the Mood for Giving|last=Heyman|first=Marshall|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://themusicuniverse.com/keep-a-child-alives-10th-annual-black-ball-raises-4-million-for-hiv-treatment/|title=Keep A Child Alive's 10th Annual Black Ball raises $4&amp;nbsp;million for HIV treatment {{!}} The Music Universe|website=The Music Universe|language=en-US|access-date=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low committed US$25&amp;nbsp;million over 15 years to the humanitarian news service [[IRIN]] on behalf of the Jynwel Foundation in November 2014, a step intended to fill a funding gap after the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs withdrew support in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/01/business/media/ailing-un-news-service-gets-25-million.html|title=Ailing U.N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7823">'''John White Brockenbrough''' (December 23, 1806 &amp;ndash; February 20, 1877) was a Virginia lawyer, [[United States federal judge|federal judge]], educator, and the founder of the Lexington Law School, now known as [[Washington and Lee University School of Law]].

==Biography==
Brockenbrough was born in [[Hanover County, Virginia]]. His parents were [[William Brockenbrough (jurist)|William Brockenbrough]] and [[Judith Brockenbrough|Judith Robinson White Brockenbrough]]. His sister was [[Judith White Brockenbrough McGuire]], who wrote ''Diary of a Southern Refugee, During the War, By a Lady of Virginia''. He was a first cousin of [[William Henry Brockenbrough]].

He attended the [[College of William and Mary]] and the [[University of Virginia]] before he studied at the [[Winchester Law School]] under [[Henry St. George Tucker, Sr.|Henry St. George Tucker]]. Others studying with Tucker at that time included [[William L. Goggin]] and [[Henry A. Wise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/21.2/note_bryson.html#FOOT57|title=The Winchester Law School, 1824–1831, by W. Hamilton Bryson and E. Lee Shepard|publisher=Law &amp; History Review|accessdate=October 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brockenbrough was born in [[Hanover County, Virginia]] and served briefly as Commonwealth's Attorney for Hanover County.

In 1837, he published two volumes of reports, containing the decisions of [[John Marshall]]'s federal circuit court opinions. He was also the editor of the ''Lexington Valley Star'' in [[Rockbridge County, Virginia]].

Brockenbrough established the [[Washington and Lee University School of Law|Lexington Law School]] in 1849. His law students included [[John J. Davis (congressman)|John J. Davis]], [[John Goode]] and [[Robert Murphy Mayo]]. In his introductory address to the first class of incoming students, Brockenbrough offered this advice:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Sooner or later the occasion will arise when you will appear before the dread tribunal of the public. Let us suppose that the time for the trial of your strength has now arrived. You are called to participate in the management of a cause which excites a profound public interest. A natural curiosity is felt to hear the maiden speech of the young lawyer! People have scarcely yet learned to look upon you as a man. Little is therefore expected of you, but you have had time for preparation, and you have used it well. You have anticipated every possible phase which the case can assume, and you are ready with your authorities to sustain all your positions. The eager crowd closes around you. They listen with surprised delight at the display of your learning and ingenuity, now enraptured with your splendid bursts of indignant eloquence, now melted into pity by some master stroke of touching pathos. With what a greedy ear they drink in those "words that burn, those thoughts that breathe!" You sit down overpowered by your own emotion. An audible murmer of approbation runs through that delighted throng! The cause is ended, the victory is won! Clients now pour in upon you, who before had none. You have made a great impression. Your reputation is now established on a firm basis, and the voice of hissing envy shall not retard your onward march. My friends, this is no fancy sketch. We are told by Mr. Butler in his "Reminiscences," that a celebrated English lawyer of the last century had said, that so sudden was his rise at the Bar, that he never knew the difference between having no income at all, and one of £3,000 sterling a year. A single great speech had established his reputation on an imperishable foundation. Who shall say that a like brilliant destiny may not be reserved for some of you, in the unwritten history of the future?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.wlu.edu/faculty/history/brockenbrough/address.htm|title=Introductory Address, October 31, 1949|publisher=Washington &amp; Lee University|accessdate=October 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1852, Brockenbrough was elected to the board of trustees of what is now [[Washington and Lee University|Washington &amp; Lee University]] (then Washington College), which had previously honored him with a Doctor of Laws degree in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://registrar.wlu.edu/honors/hondegs.htm|title=Honorary degrees conferred, by date of award|publisher=Washington &amp; Lee University|accessdate=January 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Rector from 1865–1872, he was the one to approach [[Robert E. Lee]] with the trustees' proposal to make Lee president of the College.

Brockenbrough was nominated by [[James K. Polk]] on December 23, 1845, to the seat vacated by [[Isaac S. Pennybacker]] on the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia]]. He was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on January 14, 1846, and received commission the same day. He was also a professor of law at [[Washington and Lee University School of Law|Lexington Law School]], Lexington, Virginia, from 1849 to 1861.

Along with [[John Tyler]], [[William C. Rives]], [[James Seddon]], and [[George W. Summers]], Brockenbrough represented Virginia at the [[peace conference of 1861]]. When the War began, Brockenbrough resigned from his judicial position. [[Abraham Lincoln]] nominated [[John Jay Jackson, Jr.]], to replace Brockenbrough in the Western District in 1861. During the War, Judge Brockenbrough served as the Confederate district judge for Western Virginia, and was a member of the [[Congress of the Confederate States]].

After the War, he returned to teaching law. In 1866, [[Robert E. Lee]], as president of [[Washington and Lee University|Washington College]], invited Judge Brockenbrough to join his Lexington Law School with Washington College, and continue to teach as Professor of Law and Equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law2.wlu.edu/news/page.asp?pageid=351|title=School of Law Overview :: News :: W&amp;L Law School|publisher=Washington &amp; Lee University|accessdate=September 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868, Brockenbrough was a member of a five-man committee in Lexington which called for "a White Man's party, based on the single principal [sic] that the white man alone has the right to vote."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Harwood |first1=Doug |title=Elections of 1867 and '68 were as ugly as it gets |work=Rockbridge Advocate |issue=October 2018 |ref=advocate201810}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870, [[John Randolph Tucker (Virginia politician)|John Randolph Tucker]], son of [[Henry St. George Tucker, Sr.|Henry St. George Tucker]], was hired to teach law along with Brockenbrough. Brockenbrough resigned in 1873, in a dispute over salary. He died four years later in Lexington, at the age of seventy.

The '''King Report on Corporate Governance''' is a ground-breaking booklet of guidelines for the governance structures and operation of companies in South Africa. It is issued by the King Committee on Corporate Governance. Three reports were issued in 1994 (King I), 2002 (King II), and 2009 (King III) and a fourth revision (King IV) in 2016. The Institute of Directors in Southern Africa (IoDSA) owns the copyright of the King Report on Corporate Governance and the King Code of Corporate Governance. Compliance with the King Reports is a requirement for companies listed on the [[JSE Limited|Johannesburg Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naspers.com/corp-gov-application-approach-king.php |title=Application of and approach to King III |publisher=[[Naspers]] |accessdate=4 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823004626/http://naspers.com/corp-gov-application-approach-king.php |archivedate=23 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omnia.co.za/pebble.asp?relid=1879 |title=Corporate Governance |publisher=Omnia |accessdate=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The King Report on Corporate Governance has been cited as "the most effective summary of the best international practices in corporate governance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQD4CmMa1tgC&amp;pg=PA317&amp;dq=judge+mervyn+king&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7Kc6To3VMIOw8gPa05DmAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=judge%20mervyn%20king&amp;f=false |title=Management: Fresh perspectives |page=317 |first=Steve |last=Banhegyi |publisher=Pearson Education South Africa |year=2007|isbn=978-1-86891-594-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In July 1993 the Institute of Directors in South Africa asked retired [[Supreme Court of South Africa]] judge [[Mervyn King (judge)|Mervyn E. King]] to chair a committee on corporate governance. He viewed this as an opportunity to educate the newly democratic South African public on the working of a free economy.&lt;ref name="int"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insideinvestorrelations.com/articles/16371/audience-mervyn-king/ |title=An Audience with the GRI's King |last=Stewart |first=Neil |date=9 September 2010 |accessdate=4 August 2011 |publisher=Inside Investor Relations |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113123908/http://www.insideinvestorrelations.com/articles/16371/audience-mervyn-king/ |archivedate=13 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee's report was to be the first report of its kind in South Africa.&lt;ref name="hen"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=croQAGwkNi8C&amp;pg=PA339&amp;dq=judge+mervyn+king&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7Kc6To3VMIOw8gPa05DmAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=judge%20mervyn%20king&amp;f=false |title=Business Governance Handbook: Principles and practice, Volume 1 |page=339 |last1=Hendrikse |first1=Dr. John W. |last2=Kendrikse |first2=Leigh |publisher=Juta Academic |year=2004 |isbn=0-7021-6499-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Committee members included Phillip Armstrong, Nigel Payne, and Richard Wilkinson.

==Approach ==
Unlike other corporate governance codes such as Sarbanes-Oxley, the code is non-legislative and is based on principles and practices. It also espouses an apply or explain approach, unique to the Netherlands until King and now also found in the 2010 Combined Code from the United Kingdom.

The philosophy of the code consists of the three key elements of leadership, sustainability and good corporate citizenship. It views good governance as essentially being effective, ethical leadership. King believes that leaders should direct the company to achieve sustainable economic, social and environmental performance. It views sustainability as the primary moral and economic imperative of this century; the code's view on corporate citizenship flows from a company's standing as a juristic person under the South African constitution and should operate in a sustainable manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==King I==
In 1994 the first King report on corporate governance (King 1) was published, the first corporate governance code for South Africa. It established recommended standards of conduct for boards and directors of listed companies, banks, and certain state-owned enterprises. It included not only financial and regulatory aspects, but also advocated an integrated approach that involved all stakeholders.&lt;ref name="cliff"&gt;{{cite web| 
url=http://www.mervynking.co.za/downloads/CD_King2.pdf |title=King Report on Corporate Governance for South Africa 2002 – What it means to you|publisher=Cliff Dekker Attorneys |year=2002 |accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was applicable to all companies listed on the main board of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, large public entities as defined by the Public Entities Act of South Africa; banks, financial and insurance companies as defined by the Financial Services Acts of South Africa; and large unlisted companies. It defined "large" as companies with shareholder equity over R50 million, but encouraged all companies to adopt the code.

The key principles from the first King report covered: 
* Board of directors makeup and mandate, including the role of non-executive directors and guidance on the categories of people who should make up the non-executive directors
* Appointments to the board and guidance on the maximum term for executive directors 
* Determination and disclosure of executive and non-executive director’s remuneration
* Board meeting frequency
* Balanced annual reporting
* The requirement for effective auditing
* Affirmative action programs 
* The company’s code of ethics &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

==King II==
In 2002, when the [[Earth Summit 2002|Earth Summit]] was held in Johannesburg, King pushed for a revision of the report (King II), including new sections on [[sustainability]],&lt;ref name="int"/&gt; the role of the corporate board,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RGmHAVPhmRwC&amp;pg=PA298&amp;dq=judge+mervyn+king&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GKw6Tp3NEYmh8QOn_u3zCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=judge%20mervyn%20king&amp;f=false |title=Corporate Governance |first1=Robert A. G. |last1=Monks |first2=Nell |last2=Minow |page=298 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell  |year=2003 |isbn=1-4051-1698-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[risk management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9end-Uoo8_gC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=judge+mervyn+king&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GKw6Tp3NEYmh8QOn_u3zCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=judge%20mervyn%20king&amp;f=false |title=The Executives Guide to Insurance and Risk Management |page=17 |first=Graeme |last=Berwick |publisher=Quality Results Pty Limited |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This revised code of governance was applicable from March 2002.
 
In addition to those types of organizations listed in King I, it was applicable to departments of State or national, provincial or local government administration falling under the Local Government: Municipal Finance Management Act, and   public institution or functionary exercising a power or performing a function in terms of the constitution, or exercising a public power or performing a public function in terms of any legislation, excluding   courts or judicial officers. As before, it  encourages all companies to adopt the applicable principles from the code.&lt;ref name="King2Final"&gt;{{cite web| 
url=http://library.ufs.ac.za/dl/userfiles/documents/Information_Resources/KingII%20Final%20doc.pdf |title=King Report on Corporate Governance for South Africa 2002|publisher=Institute of Directors in Southern Africa |year=2002 |accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key principles from the second King report covered the following areas:
* Directors and their responsibility
* Risk management
* Internal audit
* Integrated sustainability reporting
* Accounting and auditing&lt;ref name="King2Final"/&gt;

===Legislative Enforcement===

As before, the   code  is not enforced through legislation. However, it co-exists with  a number of laws that apply to companies and directors including the Companies Act. In addition further enforcement takes place by regulations such as the JSE Securities Exchange Listings Requirements.&lt;ref name="King2Final"/&gt;

==King III==
In an interview with Mervin King, he considered the  King II report was wrong to include sustainability as a separate chapter, leading companies to report on it separately from other factors. In the next version, the 2009 King III report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=woqEDQQzGp0C&amp;pg=PT365&amp;dq=judge+mervyn+king&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-Yg6TtTiDoiZ8QOlzJCKAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=judge%20mervyn%20king&amp;f=false |title= The A to Z of Corporate Social Responsibility |last1=Visser |first1=Wayne |last2=Matten |first2=Dirk |last3=Pohl |first3=Manfred |last4=Tolhurst |first4=Nick|isbn=978-0-470-68650-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; governance, strategy and sustainability were integrated.&lt;ref name="int"/&gt; The report recommends that organisations produce an integrated report in place of an annual financial report and a separate sustainability report and that companies create sustainability reports according to the Global Reporting Initiative's Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| 
url=https://www.saica.co.za/tabid/695/itemid/2344/language/en-ZA/An-integrated-report-is-a-new-requirement-for-list.aspx |title=An integrated report is a new requirement for listed companies
|publisher=South African Institute of Chartered Accountants |date=4 June 2010 |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the earlier versions, King III is applicable to all entities, public, private and non-profit. King encourages all entities to adopt the King III principles and explain how these have been applied or are not applicable. The code of governance was applicable from March 2010.&lt;ref name="King3"&gt;{{cite web| 
url=http://www.library.up.ac.za/law/docs/king111report.pdf |title=King Report on Corporate Governance for South Africa 2009
|publisher=Institute of Directors in Southern Africa |year=2009 |accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report incorporated a number of global emerging governance trends:
* Alternative dispute resolution
* Risk-based internal audit
* Shareholder approval of non-executive directors’ remuneration
* Evaluation of board and directors’ performance&lt;ref name="King3"/&gt;

It also  incorporated a number of new principles to address elements not previously included in the King reports:
* IT governance
* Business Rescue
* Fundamental and affected transactions in terms of director’s responsibilities during mergers, acquisitions and amalgamations.&lt;ref name="King3"/&gt;

Again, the  code of corporate governance is not enforced through legislation. However, due to evolutions in South African law many of the principles put forward in King II are now embodied as law in the Companies Act of South Africa of 2008. In addition to the Companies Act, there are additional applicable statutes that   encapsulate some of the principles of King III such as the Public Finance Management Act and the Promotion of Access to Information Act.&lt;ref name="King3"/&gt;

==King IV==
"There have been significant corporate governance and regulatory developments, locally and internationally, since King III was issued in 2009 which need to be taken into account. The other consideration is that whilst listed companies are generally applying King III, non-profit organisations, private companies and entities in the public sector have experienced challenges in interpreting and adapting King III to their particular circumstances. The enhancement will aim to make King IV more accessible to all types of entities across sectors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.iodsa.co.za/resource/collection/16F4503D-86F9-43D5-AEB4-C067B06EB59C/Guide_to_questions_and_answers_on_King_IV.pdf |title=Guide to questions and answers on King IV |publisher=Institute of Directors in Southern Africa |accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Family Life and Education ===
Heikkinen was born the third child in a family of ten in Brantwood, WI. He graduated from Tripoli High School in 1935,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; married his wife Norma in 1941,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; worked in Milwaukee, WI for the Koehring Company,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wester|first=Dave|date=February 1998|title=A Kind and Generous Industrialist|url=|journal=The Timber Producer|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to Price County in 1945&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; where he made the town of Prentice his home.  Heikkinen had four children with his wife Norma.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He died  on Friday, Sept. 10, 1999.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Prentice Hydraulics, Inc. ===
In 1959, after running Heikkinen Machine Shop with his brothers for over a decade, Heikkinen incorporated Prentice Hydraulics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With Prentice Hydraulics, Heikkinen excelled due to selling his knuckleboom loader, a revolutionary design for pulpwood loaders that allowed a single operator to load a truck through a design that featured essentially a “yo-yo” and “claw” versus manually wrapping logs with a cable or worse, loading the logs by hand.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Monte|first=Mike|date=July 2015|title=Leo Heikkinen Honored by Price County Development Association|url=|journal=Great Lakes Timber Professionals Association|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company began with 35 employees and grew to 340 employees and $9 million in sales prior to its sale to Omark Industries in 1967.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Multitek North America, LLC ===
In 1970, Heikkinen founded Multitek North America, LLC which focused primarily on machines to process firewood, conveyors, wheel-crusher and attachments for skid steers.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.apg-wi.com/price_county_review/news/business/heikkinen-selected-for-lifetime-achievement-award/article_f3b978b0-f9c1-11e4-ba00-d392083eb8c7.html|title=Heikkinen selected for 2015 Lifetime Achievement Award|work=APG of Wisconsin|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multitek was in the Heikkinen family (first owned and operated by Leo and then by his three sons) until 2006 when it was sold to a Wisconsin-based investment group.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.apg-wi.com/price_county_review/news/business/investors-group-acquires-multitek-inc/article_f4dea91a-57f7-504a-95ec-e94f0d3ec575.html|title=Investors group acquires Multitek Inc.|last=Peterson|first=Cathy|work=APG of Wisconsin|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doug Kamps became the first President of Multitek North America, LLC under the new owners.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Charity ===
Heikkinen was heavily involved in community projects around Prentice, WI. His donations included a community center, community park and pond, high school athletic fields, lights and equipment, a house for the town’s first doctor, land for the village’s first dental office. He also built and donated the Village of Prentice Municipal Golf Course and the Village of Prentice Airport.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Heikkinen served as Village President for approximately 10 years while donating most of his pay back to the community.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2233">'''Louis Franklin Bache''' (7 October 1779 – 4 October 1818) was the son of [[Richard Bache]] and [[Sarah Franklin Bache]], the daughter of the American statesman [[Benjamin Franklin]] and his wife [[Deborah Read]]. Bache served as a lieutenant colonel in the Pennsylvania State Militia during the [[War of 1812]] between the United States and Great Britain.

Bache was the commander of a detachment of 351 men in the Pennsylvania State Militia Volunteers which was assigned by Pennsylvania Governor [[Simon Snyder]] to defend the City of Philadelphia against the British in the War of 1812. In October 1814, Lt. Col. Bache refused to submit to federal military takeover of his Pennsylvania State Militia detachment because his soldiers originally joined the state militia pursuant to a later-disputed agreement with U.S. Brigadier General [[Joseph Bloomfield]] that Bache's soldiers would always serve under their state (and not federal) militia officers.

Standing firm on principle, Bache and his five subordinate officers were arrested. Bache was court-martialed and was dismissed from U.S. military service. The military court decided not to punish Bache further because the court believed Bache's closing arguments...that he acted in good faith based upon Governor Snyder's orders, his motives were pure, and that trust was placed in him by his soldiers and the soldiers' parents who allowed their sons to volunteer only under the command of trusted state militia officers. The Bache court-martial case and the related U.S. Supreme Court case of ''United States v. Peters'' has been the subject of historical discussion regarding federal-state relations and balance of power.&lt;ref&gt;Citizen Soldiers in the War of 1812, Ch. 8, Federal-State Relations, p. 141, Vol. 1998, By Carl Edward Skeen.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
Bache married Margaret Riley (1781–1806) in 1802. They had two children together:
* Margaret Bache (1803–1871)
* Louis Franklin Bache, Jr. (1805–1887)

The '''Lower Manhattan Development Corporation''' was formed in November 2001,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewnyc.com/displaynews.aspx?newsid=2b0bfde6-61b6-48f9-a6ca-70475846c95b "GOVERNOR AND MAYOR NAME LOWER MANHATTAN REDEVELOPMENT CORPORATION"]&lt;/ref&gt; following the [[September 11 attacks]], to plan the reconstruction of [[Lower Manhattan]] and distribute nearly $10 billion in federal funds aimed at rebuilding downtown Manhattan. It is a subsidiary of the [[Empire State Development Corporation]], which is a [[New York state public-benefit corporations|New York state public-benefit corporation]].

==History==
The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation was formed in November 2001 by then-[[Governor of New York|Governor]] [[George Pataki]] and then-[[Mayor of New York City|Mayor]] [[Rudolph Giuliani]]. The LMDC is a [[joint venture|joint]] State-City [[corporation]] governed by a 16-member [[Board of Directors]], half appointed by the [[Governor of New York]] and half by the [[Mayor of New York]]. As a result, Pataki and Giuliani appointees dominate the LMDC. Its original chairman was [[John C. Whitehead]], a former Deputy Secretary of State and head of [[Goldman Sachs]].

In February 2003, the LMDC chose [[Daniel Libeskind]]'s master plan for the reconstruction of the [[World Trade Center (2001–present)|World Trade Center]] complex. The organization also sponsored the [[World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition|international design competition]] for the [[World Trade Center Memorial]], which resulted in [[Michael Arad]] and Peter Walker's ''Reflecting Absence'' being chosen as the winning design in January 2004.

Having distributed its funds, the LMDC in July 2006 announced plans to dissolve and transfer its responsibilities to other existing agencies and foundations, including the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum at the World Trade Center|W.T.C. Memorial Foundation]], and the Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center.

===Organization structure===
LMDC does not own the [[World Trade Center site]] and this has created some problems in its dealings with [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] and [[Larry Silverstein]], who has a lease to the site.

===Funding===
The LMDC was funded through the disbursement of [[Community Development Block Grant]]s-amounting to $2.783 billion—approved by the federal government in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and resultant destruction of much of lower Manhattan's economic and structural base. It was not listed in the [[New York State Authorities Budget Office]]'s 2018 annual report, and so it may be dissolved or it may have chosen not to report for 2017.

===Criticism===
Two members of the LMDC's board have asserted that up to $45 million allocated to the LMDC from a "community enhancement" fund in May 2005 has not been directly accounted for, and that up to $15 million from that stipend might have been spent in areas other than those it had been explicitly stipulated for.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downtownexpress.com/de0169/shiftingdollars.html "Shifting dollars, debatable legacy as L.M.D.C. approaches its final days"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Attorney General Democrat [[Eliot Spitzer]] became governor in 2007, rethought his condemnation, and announced a "reinvigorated LMDC" that would continue the revitalization of Lower Manhattan. Mayor Bloomberg welcomed the Governor's renewed interest at the time. However, in September 2008, Mayor Bloomberg condemned the LMDC as a contributor to a slower progress in rebuilding and he demanded dissolution of the LMDC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=nytimes.com|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/nyregion/11rebuild.html |title=Mayor Seeks to Disband Lower Manhattan Panel | first=Charles V.|last=Bagli|date=September 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engraving===
The LMDC obtained a patent for one of its 9/11 Memorial endeavors in 2005. ''Engraving for a National Memorial'', U.S. Patent D506,860, designed by Michael Anthony Stahl of Huntsville, AL. was registered with the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] on June 28, 2005.

'''Mark Abrams''' (27 April 1906 – 25 September 1994) was a social scientist and market research expert who pioneered new techniques in statistical surveying and opinion polling.

==Background and education==

Mark Abrams was born Max Alexander Abramowitz in Edmonton, North London in 1906 to Jewish parents who had emigrated from Lithuania and Latvia to the [[East End of London]] in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford ODNB: Abrams, Mark Alexander|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/54696}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later described his father Abram Abramowitz, a journeyman bootmaker, shopkeeper, and house agent, as a 'philosophical anarchist'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An interview with Mark Abrams (19 September 1984) 1. Family Origins|url=http://surveyresearch.weebly.com/an-interview-with-mark-abrams-audio-files.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Abrams received a scholarship to attend [[The Latymer School]], then read economics at the [[London School of Economics]]. He went on to complete a PhD in early modern English economic history under the supervision of [[R. H. Tawney]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Abrams, 'The Gold and Silver Thread Monopolies of James I', unpublished PhD dissertation, London School of Economics, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Between 1931-1933 Abrams was a research fellow at the progressive [[Brookings Institution]] in Washington, DC. In 1933 he joined the research department of the [[London Press Exchange]], one of Britain's leading advertising agencies. Here Abrams began developing his pioneering work in social investigation, market research, and opinion polling by conducting large-scale statistical surveys into consumer behaviour. His national newspaper readership surveys, which included over 20,000 participants between 1934-38, were landmarks in survey research and were credited with establishing the widespread use of the [[NRS social grade|ABC1 system]] of social classification in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Dawn Mitchell, 'Research for the Truth: Mark Abrams (1906-1994), ''Guardian'', 27 September 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Abrams's contacts with other social scientists working abroad during this period led to his work retrieving refugees from [[Nazi]] Europe (in 1939 helping [[Sigmund Freud]] make his final move to England).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford ODNB: Abrams, Mark Alexander|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/54696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War Two]] Abrams was employed first in the [[BBC]] Overseas Research Department, then at the Psychological Warfare Board, where he carried out government surveys into working-class diets under rationing and the impact of bombing on civilian morale, and also commissioned covert psychological analysis into the mind of [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside Hitler's Mind, University of Cambridge Research (4 May 2012).|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/inside-hitlers-mind}}&lt;/ref&gt; His studies of food consumption during the war contributed to the establishment of the National Food Survey in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Data Service: National Food Survey 1940-2000|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/54696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abrams returned to the London Press Exchange in 1946 to direct its research department as an independent subsidiary consultancy, Research Services Ltd. By the early 1960s the company employed over ninety members of staff and produced surveys for 300 clients a year, including academic as well as commercial, political, and public sector organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Schwarzkopf, 'The Statisticalization of the Consumer in British Market Research, c. 1920-1960: Profiling a Good Society', in Glen O'Hara and Tom Crook (eds.), ''Statistics and the Public Sphere: Numbers and the People in Modern Britain'' (London: Routledge, 2012), pp. 144-62.&lt;/ref&gt; Research Services Ltd. was commissioned to undertake social surveys prior to the building of [[Peterlee]] new town and the establishment of [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Black, 'The Impression of Affluence: Political Culture in the 1950s and 1960s', in Lawrence Black and Hugh Pemberton (eds.) ''An Affluent Society? Britain's Post-War 'Golden Age' Revisited'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2004), p. 99; Mark Clapson, 'The Rise and Fall of Monica Felton, British Town Planner and Peace Activist, 1930s to 1950s', ''Planning Perspectives'', 30:2 (2015): 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Abrams, along with contemporary pollsters such as [[Henry William Durant|Henry Durant]] of the [[British Institute of Public Opinion]], gained a reputation as an expert authority on market research and mass communication techniques in Britain, and published widely in academic journals as well as newspapers and the popular press.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Moran, 'Mass Observation, Market Research, and the Birth of the Focus Group 1937-1997', ''Journal of British Studies'' 47:4 (2008): 827-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of his most influential market research reports coined the phrase 'teenage consumer'&lt;ref&gt;Mark Abrams, ''The Teenage Consumer'' (London: London Press Exchange, 1959) and Mark Abrams, ''Teenage Consumer Spending in 1959'' (London: London Press Exchange, 1961).&lt;/ref&gt;, drawing attention to the new significance of a rapidly expanding youth market for products and advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Nixon, 'Understanding Ordinary Women: Advertising, Consumer Research and Mass Consumption in Britain, 1948-67', ''Journal of Cultural Economy'', 2:3 (2009): fn. 14, p. 320; [[David Kynaston]], ''Modernity Britain, 1957-62'' (London: Bloomsbury, 2013), p. 341. cf. David Fowler, ''The First Teenagers: The Lifestyle of Young Wage-Earners in Interwar Britain'' (Oxford: Routledge, 1995) pp. 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; Abrams was one of the founding members of the [[Market Research Society]] and an advisor of the [[Which?|Consumers' Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Market Research Society: History|url=https://www.mrs.org.uk/mrs/history}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research Services Ltd. (later known as RSL) was one of the founder companies of [[Ipsos MORI]].

From the mid-1950s Abrams became closely connected with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and carried out many of their private opinion polls, first with the modernisers in the party aligned with [[Hugh Gaitskell]] and then [[Harold Wilson]], for whom he worked on the development of Labour's publicity campaign for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Wring, ''The Politics of Marketing the Labour Party'' (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005), pp. 67-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Anthony Erceg''' (26 March 1956 – 4 November 2005) was an [[Auckland]] businessman who was the founder of Independent Liquor which was [[New Zealand]]’s largest independently owned liquor distributor. Independent Liquor are known predominately for their Ready to Drink (RTD) brands such as KGB, Woodstock and Vodka Cruisers.&lt;ref name="nzherald"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10356108|publisher=nzherald.co.nz|title=Millionaire's body found in wreckage – National – NZ Herald News|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the New Zealand’s wealthiest individuals at the time of his death in 2005. Subsequently, on his death his wife, Lynnette Erceg and family inherited this wealth.&lt;ref name="nzherald2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11301667|publisher=nzherald.co.nz|title=NBR rich list: Burger baron dining at top table – Business – NZ Herald News|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Erceg was born in West Auckland in to a Croatian winemaking family who operated Pacific vineyard on McLeod Road in [[Te Atatu South]]. He attended [[Kelston Boys High School]]. Erceg was a top pupil, who skipped sixth form and was awarded Dux of Kelston Boys High School in 1972. He earned his PhD nine years later, from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and went on to teach maths at university level.&lt;ref name="nzherald3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10353810|publisher=nzherald.co.nz|title=Missing millionaire – the reclusive wunderkind – National – NZ Herald News|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
Erceg, who had completed his PhD in mathematics at the University of California, was set on an academic career with a position as a junior professor. However, he decided to return home to help with his ailing father’s West Auckland-based family wine business.&lt;ref name="independentliquor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independentliquor.co.nz/a-kiwi-success-story/|publisher=independentliquor.co.nz|title=A Kiwi Success Story &amp;#124; Independent Liquor|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a family disagreement over the direction of the wine company, he decided to go into business for himself to form Calypso Beverage Company Ltd in 1987. This business evolved to Independent Liquor.&lt;ref name="independentliquor"/&gt;

The business success relied upon alternative marketing strategies to combat the larger players in the NZ alcohol industry. Part of these tactics was to incent their retail customers, helping them with increased margins the big companies wouldn’t provide.&lt;ref name="independentliquor"/&gt;

Independent Liquor would quickly rise to the 3rd largest liquor distributor in New Zealand and had a 65% share of the market for RTD’s in 2005. At that time, Independent Liquor were also exporting to 70 countries around the world.&lt;ref name="nzherald3"/&gt;

==Death==
He was killed in November 2005 when the helicopter he was piloting crashed south of Auckland near Raglan. On board was Grolsch International export director Guus Klatte, who had flown from Amsterdam to NZ to discuss a lucrative business deal with Erceg and was also killed. The wreckage of the helicopter was not found until two weeks after the crash.&lt;ref name="nzherald"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nzedge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzedge.com/news/crash-claims-liquor-chiefs/|publisher=nzedge.com|title=Crash Claims Liquor Chiefs – News, Obituaries, Society – NZEDGE|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mukhtar Kabyluly Ablyazov''' {{lang-kk|Мұхтар Қабылұлы Әблязов|translit=Muhtar Qabyluly Ábliazov}}, born 16 May 1963) is a [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] politician, businessman, and banker accused of embezzling and mismanaging $6 billion of bank assets while serving as bank chairman in one of the biggest financial frauds in history. 
&lt;ref name="btaembez"/&gt;

He was the founder of [[Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan]] (DCK), a political party that disbanded in 2005.   He is also the author of ''Ablyazov against Nazarbayev''.

Ablyazov is alleged to have embezzled $6 billion from BTA Bank while serving as chairman.&lt;ref name="btaembez"&gt;{{cite news|title=Arrest warrant for Kazakh billionaire accused of one of world's biggest frauds|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/16/arrest-warrant-kazakh-billionaire-mukhtar-ablyazov|agency=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; From July 2013 to December 2016, Ablyazov was detained by [[France|French]] authorities,&lt;ref name="AFPRelease"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/10/france-blocks-extradition-kazakh-oligarch-mukhtar-ablyazovto/ France blocks extradition of Kazakh oligarch Mukhtar Ablyazov to Russia], Agence France-Presse (December 10, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; as Russia sought Ablyazov's [[extradition]] from France, but Ablyazov argued that extradition would place him at risk of ill-treatment and an unfair trial.&lt;ref name="rferl.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/kazakhstan-france-ablyazov-russia-embezzlement-extradition/26654608.html|title=French Court Authorizes Extradition of Fugitive Kazakh Banker|work=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights groups [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]], as well as many members of the [[European Parliament]], wrote in opposition to extradition of Ablyazov.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2014/10/france-stop-extradition-kazakhstani-opposition-activist-risk-torture/|title=France|publisher=amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/05/21/france/kazakhstan-letter-french-prime-minister-manuel-valls-case-mukhtar-ablyazov|title=France/Kazakhstan: Letter to French Prime Minister Manuel Valls on Case of Mukhtar Ablyazov|work=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2015/10/12/l-extradition-vers-la-russie-de-l-opposant-kazakh-moukhtar-abliazov-a-ete-validee-par-paris_4788076_1653578.html|title=L’extradition vers la Russie de l’opposant kazakh Moukhtar Abliazov a été validée par Paris|author=|date=12 October 2015|publisher=|via=Le Monde|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, a French court in [[Lyon]] issued an extradition order.&lt;ref name="rferl.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Armitage"&gt;Jim Armitage, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/mukhtar-ablyazov-kazakh-billionaire-to-be-extradited-to-russia-from-france-a6691731.html Mukhtar Ablyazov: Kazakh billionaire to be extradited to Russia from France], ''The Independent'' (October 12, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in December 2016, France's [[Supreme court|highest]] administrative court, the [[Conseil d'État (France)|Conseil d'Etat]], canceled the extradition order, on the ground that Russia [[Political offence exception|had a political motive]] in making the extradition request.&lt;ref name="AFPRelease"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReutersCanceled"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bta-ablyazov-extradition-idUSKBN13Y2FC French court cancels Kazakh tycoon Ablyazov's extradition to Russia], Reuters (December 9, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Ablyazov was released from the [[Fleury-Mérogis Prison]].&lt;ref name="AFPRelease"/&gt; 
Latvian MEP Iveta Grigule-Pēterse warned European Union NGOs and advocacy groups to scrutinize the source of the funds or donations received, citing Ablyazov's use of allegedly embezzled BTA Bank funds to underwrite PR campaigns to minimize Ablyazov's fraud and to present Ablysov as a political dissident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MEP tells NGOs in Astana to be careful who they receive money from|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/central-asia/interview/mep-tells-ngos-in-astana-to-be-careful-who-they-receive-money-from/|website=www.euractiv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life and education==

In 1986, Ablyazov graduated from the [[National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute)|Moscow Engineering Physics Institute]]. There he earned a degree in theoretical physics.&lt;ref name=rferl&gt;{{cite web|last=Sindelar|first=Daisy|title=How Far Will Nazarbaev Go To Take Down Mukhtar Ablyazov?|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/kazakhstan-nazarbaev-ablyazov/25010488.html|publisher=Radio Free Europe Radio Library|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation, he worked as a junior researcher at the [[Al-Farabi Kazakh National University|Kazakh National University]].

In 1987, Ablyazov married Alma Shalabayeva.

In 1990, Ablyazov was enrolled in postgraduate studies in the Moscow Engineering and Physics Institute. For that reason, he was fired from his role as a junior researcher at the Kazakh National University.

==Career==

Ablyazov started working during the fall of the Soviet Union and the start of Kazakhstan's Independence. His first job was the buying and selling of computers and copying machines. In 1991, Ablyazov registered his first company and called it "Madina," which is the name of his first daughter.

In 1992, Ablyazov started his business by supplying all the regions of Kazakhstan with products such as salt, sugar, flower, matches, tea, chocolate, and medicine. In order to run this business, Ablyazov established [[Astana Holding]] in [[Kazakhstan]], a multi-sector private holding company, which established and consisted of: Astana-Sugar, Astana-Food, Aral-Salt, The Shymkent Pasta Factory, Astana-Medical Service, Astana-Motors, Astana-Interotel, Astana-Bank, Trade House Zhanna (furniture).

In 1997, Ablyazov was appointed as head of the state-owned [[KEGOC|Kazakhstan Electricity Grid Operating Company]]. KEGOC was a company close to buncruptcy at the time of his appointment as its head. In one year, he managed to make the state-owned company profitable.

In 1998, as head of KEGOC, Ablyazov was named Minister for Energy, Industry, and Trade.&lt;ref name="BBC Timeline: Kazakhstan"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/1298395.stm BBC Timeline: Kazakhstan] - BBC chronology of key events, 11 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Ablyazov has been described by [[Radio Free Europe]]/[[Radio Liberty]] (RFE/RL) as “part of a younger generation” that [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]], president of Kazakhstan, “hoped to harness as he pushed his resource-rich nation into the 21st century.” Yet after a few years, “Ablyazov and the others had broken ranks, citing disenchantment with endemic corruption in Nazarbayev's inner circle.”&lt;ref name=rferl /&gt;

===BTA Bank===
In 1998, together with a consortium of Kazakh investors, Ablyazov acquired a loan to buy the shares in [[BTA Bank|Bank Turan Alem]] in a privatization auction for $72 million. He later paid back the loan. The bank later came to be known as BTA Bank.

===BTA Bank growth===
Ablyazov served as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of BTA Bank from 2005 to 2009. During Ablyazov's leadership, BTA Bank reported dynamic growth,{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=January 2016}} and became one of the most promising banks in the CIS. By 2008, BTA Bank had grown to become the leader in the emerging markets, the fourth-largest bank among the CIS countries, and one of the three fastest-growing banks in the world. In 2007, ''Euromoney'' magazine named BTA Bank the best bank in Central Asia and in 2008 BTA Bank received the Global Finance award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bta.kz/en/press/news/2007/07/19/224/|title=BTA Bank - News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, between 2006 and 2008, Mukhtar Ablyazov had been pressured by the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, to transfer 50% of shares of BTA Bank to the state. Ablyazov refused to transfer the bank's assets into the control of Nazarbayev, and, as a result, in February 2009, the bank was nationalised under the pretext of the need to save the banking sector from bankruptcy.

In 2008, BTA Bank was the largest commercial financial institution in Kazakhstan, with internal reserves allowing for cooperation with foreign and domestic owners of the shares. At the same time, BTA Bank was the largest creditor of the Kazakh economy – the bank owned about 30% of all the loans granted to legal entities. The control over BTA Bank has been illegally adopted by the National Welfare Fund ‘Samruk-Kazyna’, a holding company owned entirely by the state, despite the healthy condition of the bank. Timur Kulibayev, Nazarbayev’s son-in-law, was the president of this fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mukhtarablyazov.org/p/37,bank-bta|title=Bank BTA|work=Mukhtar Ablyazov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BTA Bank bankruptcy===
In 2010 a US bankruptcy judge granted BTA Bank Chapter 15 protection while it worked to restructure $11.6 billion owed to foreign creditors as a result of loans made while Ablyazov was chairman.&lt;ref name="Law360"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kazakh Bank Gets OK For US Bankruptcy Protection|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/153504/kazakh-bank-gets-ok-for-us-bankruptcy-protection|agency=Law360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, Kazakhstan's [[sovereign wealth fund]], [[Samruk-Kazyna]], injected significant funds into BTA in an effort to keep the bank solvent, effectively becoming its majority shareholder.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLM16723920090922 Kazakh bank BTA signs debt restructuring MOU] - Reuters, 22 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before [[Samruk-Kazyna]]'s intervention Ablyazov fled Kazakhstan to London.

==Alleged fraud charges==
While Chairman of BTA Bank, Ablyazov is alleged to have embezzled or misappropriated up to $6 billion into shell companies and offshore bank accounts.&lt;ref name="embezbta"&gt;{{cite web|title=BTA v Ablyazov: the secret billionaire|url=https://www.thelawyer.com/issues/6-february-2012/bta-v-ablyazov-the-secret-billionaire/|website=The Lawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ablyazov's case is one of the largest financial fraud cases in history.&lt;ref name="btaembez"/&gt; Ablyazov stated that BTA Bank assets were concealed to guard against forced nationalization.&lt;ref name="financialtimes5july13"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mukhtar Ablyazov at centre of fight over Kazakhstan’s BTA Bank|url=https://www.ft.com/content/23571482-e584-11e2-ad1a-00144feabdc0|agency=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Sir Nigel John Martin Teare said that Ablyazov had committed a “fraud on an epic scale” through use of offshore holding companies.&lt;ref name="newyorker"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trump’s Business of Corruption|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/08/21/trumps-business-of-corruption|website=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===INTERPOL Red Notice===
[[File:Ablyazov INTERPOL Red Notice.jpg|thumb|INTERPOL Red Notice for Ablyazov]]
INTERPOL issued a [[Interpol notice|Red Notice]] arrest warrant for Ablyazov, which was basis for his arrest by French authorities in 2013.&lt;ref name="arrestnotice"&gt;{{cite news|title='Trojan horse' raid ends 18-month hunt for Kazakh banker Mukhtar Ablyazov|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/trojan-horse-raid-ends-18-month-hunt-for-kazakh-banker-mukhtar-ablyazov-8744984.html|agency=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpol said Ablyazov was wanted in Russia on separate charges for "large scale fraud,” money laundering and document forgery.&lt;ref name="thestar"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dissident Kazakh oligarch Ablyazov arrested on the French Riviera, sources say|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/08/01/dissident_kazakh_oligarch_ablyazov_arrested_on_the_french_riviera_sources_say.html|agency=The Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpol withdrew the red notice in July 2017.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Court proceedings===

====English High Court of Justice====
24 March 2009 [[BTA Bank]] launched legal proceedings against Ablyazov in the UK [[High Court]] shortly after his arrival in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/23571482-e584-11e2-ad1a-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3wCYbKtZ7|title=Mukhtar Ablyazov at centre of fight over Kazakhstan’s BTA Bank|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ablyazov was the subject of seven legal claims in the English High Court totalling $3.7 billion (£2.26 billion).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-03/bta-banks-sues-ex-chairman-ablyazov-for-1-2-billion-in-london.html BTA Bank Sues Ex-Chairman Ablyazov for $1.2 Billion in London] - Bloomberg, Erik Larson, 4 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The first decision that Ablyazov lost in the UK courts was passed down by William Blair, brother of Tony Blair. Shortly after, Tony Blair was hired by Nazarbayev to be an economic advisor. Tony Blair was paid a multi-million dollar salary.

In October 2010, Ablyazov lost a legal fight to prevent his assets from being subject to a receivership order. The ruling came after Justice Teare stated that Ablyazov “cannot be trusted” not to dissipate his assets prior to trial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/03/ablyazov-kazakh-bank-court-ruling Kazakh Banker Loses Courtroom Battle Over Assets] - The Guardian, Simon Goodley, 3 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Ablyazov argued, in his defense, that the takeover of BTA Bank by Samruk-Kazyna in February 2009 was “the culmination of the campaign by President Nazarbayev and his allies to wrest ownership and control of [BTA] from [Ablyazov].”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/dec/02/kazakhstan-regime-link-to-ftse-firms Court documents allege 'corrupt' Kazakhstan regime's link to FTSE firms] - The Guardian, Simon Goodley, 2 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a May 2011 letter, Ablyazov accused Nazarbaev and his advisor Bulat Utemuratov of being the real owners of a 48.73% share in [[Kazzinc]], a firm that [[Glencore International]] was planning to buy at the time. Ablyazov wrote that “in 2005-2009, when Mr. Utemuratov was blackmailing me on behalf of” Nazarbaev, demanding a share in BTA Bank, “he asked me to transfer the stocks to the companies that control KazZink now.” Ablyazov said that he had testified to this effect in a London court.&lt;ref name="kazakhstan voice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mukhtar Ablyazov- the president of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev and his trusted adviser Bulat Utemuratov are the real owners of 48,73% share in "KazZink"|url=http://kazakhstanvoice.blogspot.no/2011/05/mukhtar-ablyazov-president-of-republic.html|publisher=kazakhstan voice|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ablyazov was granted asylum in the [[UK]] in July 2011, a recognition that he would face political persecution if sent back to Kazakhstan.&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{cite journal|title=Case of Yefimova v. Russia|journal=European Court of Human Rights|date=19 February 2013|pages=1–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Kazakhstan's request for his extradition was ignored.&lt;ref name="forum 18"&gt;{{cite web|last=Corley|first=Felix|title=Kazakhstan: Why was Muslim prisoner of conscience extradited to Uzbekistan|url=http://www.forum18.org/archive.php?article_id=1833|publisher=Forum 18|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Daily Telegraph, the Kazakh government threatened to punish British firms by awarding lucrative contracts to [[China]] if the UK granted Ablyazov asylum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/kazakhstan/7958777/Asylum-case-could-lead-to-rift-with-Kazakhstan.html] - The Daily Telegraph, 22 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2012, Kazakh authorities sought to impliciate Ablyazov in an alleged terror plot. One report suggested that an “obvious reason for trying to nail Ablyazov” was that “unlike other political figures in exile, he has a presence inside Kazakhstan through his links to an opposition group and local media outlets.” The accusation was, according to this report, “designed to tarnish his reputation – and that of his associates, too – in the eyes of the international community,” as well as to provide “a useful distraction from the embarrassment which the government suffered after violence in the western town of Janaozen in December [2011], in which its police force is accused of opening fire on protesters, killing 14 and injuring over 100.” The report said that “authorities seem dead set on eliminating Ablyazov’s capacity to exert any influence in Kazakstan (sic).”&lt;ref name=iwpr&gt;{{cite web|title=Questions Over Kazakstan "Terror Plot"|url=http://iwpr.net/report-news/questions-over-kazakstan-terror-plot|publisher=IWPR|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, a U.K. court ordered Mukhtar Ablyazov to pay £1.02 bln ($1.63 bln) plus interest. The court also ordered "new post-judgment asset-freezing orders be made against Mr. Ablyazov in an unlimited sum and new asset-freezing orders in relation to certain other defendants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BTA Bank: Court Rules Against Ablyazov in $2 bln Suit|url=http://www.satrapia.com/news/article/bta-bank-court-rules-against-ablyazov-in-2-bln-suit/|newspaper=The Gazette of Central Asia|date=28 November 2012|publisher=Satrapia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The High Court made judgment upon Ilyas Khrapunov to pay damages of US$500m (US$424,110,000 + interest of US$75,851,783.01) for conspiring with Ablyazov to move assets in breach of the freezing order.&lt;ref name="21junejudgment"&gt;{{cite web |title=Approved Judgement BTA Bank vs. Mukhtar Ablyazov &amp; Ilyas Khrapunov |url=https://www.hoganlovells.com/~/media/hogan-lovells/pdf/2018/approved-judgment-dated-21-june-2018-bta-khrapunov.pdf?la=en |publisher=UK High Court}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criminal Court of Kazakhstan====
Mukhtar Ablyazov was sentenced to 20 years in prison in June 2017.&lt;ref name="rferljune"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fugitive Kazakh Banker Ablyazov Sentenced To 20 Years In Absentia|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/kazakhstan-ablyazov-20-years-banker-embezzlement/28533214.html|agency=rferl}}&lt;/ref&gt; An appeals court upheld the indictment for criminal conspiracy, embezzlement and money laundering.&lt;ref name="n4e"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kazakh court upholds 20-year sentence for banker Mukhtar Ablyazov|url=http://www.news4europe.eu/6350_world/4757510_kazakh-court-upholds-20-year-sentence-for-banker-mukhtar-ablyazov.html|agency=News4Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Southern District of New York====

City of Almaty, Kazahkstan v. Mukhtar Ablyazov was filed on July 9, 2015 in the Southern District of New York federal court with Judge Alison Julie Nathan presiding.&lt;ref name="sdny"&gt;{{cite web|title=City of Almaty, Kazahkstan v.

===Money Laundering through New York City Real Estate===
A 2015 suit to recover embezzled funds was filed in the Southern District of New York listing Ablyazov, Viktor Khrapunov, Joseph Chetrit and The Chetrit Group as defendants.&lt;ref name="sdny05345"&gt;{{cite web|title=City of Almaty, Kazahkstan, et al. v.

===Silk Road Group===
While Ablyazov was BTA Chairman, the bank partnered on investment projects in Georgia with the Silk Road Group,&lt;ref name="civilge"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kazakh Bank to Invest in Adjara’s Resorts|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=11488|agency=Civil.ge}}&lt;/ref&gt; a company with a history of alleged financial fraud and money laundering.&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; During Ablyazov's chairmanship, and at the time of alleged financial mismanagement, BTA Bank loans were made to Silk Road Group projects or Silk Road Group owned-companies.&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; In 2014 Silk Road Group collaborated with former BTA Bank executive Yerkin Tatishev and Ablyazov business partner to repay outstanding BTA Bank loans.&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; He and the Silk Road Group co-owned a Georgian bank creating a conflict of interest.&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; The SilK Road Group was revealed to be a client of the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, which specialized in offshore corporate structuring, accounting for purpose of sanction and tax evasion, and subject of the Panama Papers.&lt;ref name="transparint"&gt;{{cite web|title=Silk Road Group in The Panama Papers|url=https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/12221428|website=The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silk Road Group entered an agreement with the Trump Organization to license the Trump brand for two luxury developments in Batumi and Tbilisi, Georgia.&lt;ref name="trump"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Hastings Represents Silk Road Group on First- Ever Trump Projects in Central Asia|url=https://www.paulhastings.com/news/details/?id=869bd769-2334-6428-811c-ff00004cbded}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was cancelled when Trump became president to avoid a conflict of interest.

==Alleged Murder for Hire==
The man convicted of manslaughter for accidentally shooting banker Yerzhan Tatishev on a hunting trip in 2004 said in a 2017 television documentary that he was in fact hired by Ablyazov to kill Tatishev.&lt;ref name="hiredhit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kazakhstan to re-examine 2004 banker's death, may target Nazarbayev critic|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kazakhstan-ablyazov/kazakhstan-to-re-examine-2004-bankers-death-may-target-nazarbayev-critic-idUSKBN1CU2PB?il=0|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="KazakhCourts"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Ablyazov Affair: ‘Fraud on an Epic Scale’|url=https://thediplomat.com/2018/02/the-ablyazov-affair-fraud-on-an-epic-scale/|website=The Diplomat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tatishev was Ablyazov's BTA Bank partner and shareholder.&lt;ref name="memories"&gt;{{cite web|title=Yerzhan TATISHEV Memories|url=http://bta.kz/en/about/history/yerzhantatishev_memories/|website=BTA Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kazakh Prosecutor General indicted Ablyazov on 17 August 2018 for the murder of former BTA Bank Chairman Erzhan Tatishev.&lt;ref name="17Augindictment"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kazakh Prosecutor General’s Office qualifies Ablyazov’s crime as premeditated murder |url=https://astanatimes.com/2018/08/kazakh-prosecutor-generals-office-qualifies-ablyazovs-crime-as-premeditated-murder/ |agency=The Astana Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

In November 2001, Ablyazov and other colleagues, including fellow disenchanted proteges of Nazarbaev, co-founded the [[Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan]] (DCK), an opposition political movement that challenged the Nazarbayev regime. The DCK included a combination of existing politicians and major businessmen and called for the decentralisation of political power, a strong legislature, and an independent judiciary to balance the power concentrated in the executive branch. This opposition initiative, according to RFE/RL, “quickly drew the wrath of the regime.”&lt;ref name=rferl/&gt;

In July 2002, as one of the main leaders of the DCK, Ablyazov was convicted of “abusing official powers as a minister” and sentenced to six years in prison. Also sent to prison were his fellow would-be reformers and former Nazarbaev proteges Galymzhan Zhakiyanov and Altynbek Sarsenbaev.&lt;ref name=rferl /&gt;

In response to pressure from the international community, including Amnesty International and the European Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23870765-living-in-fear-in-london-the-exiled-kazakh-banker-accused-of-dollar-2-billion-fraud.do Living in fear in London] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129223443/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23870765-living-in-fear-in-london-the-exiled-kazakh-banker-accused-of-dollar-2-billion-fraud.do |date=2010-11-29 }} - Evening Standard, 25 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; he was released in May 2003 after only serving ten months, on the condition that he renounce politics.&lt;ref name="BBC Timeline: Kazakhstan"/&gt;

Ablyazov moved to Moscow in 2003 to rebuild his business ties and in 2005 became the Chairman of the Board of Directors of BTA Bank.

After his release from prison, Ablyazov reportedly spent “millions of dollars funding opposition groups and independent media.” RFE/RL has quoted Yevgeny Zhovtis, head of the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law, as saying that “Nazarbaev to a certain extent felt betrayed” by Ablyazov and the others, given that “he thinks that he provided them the space to become wealthy, to become well-known, to make a career in state service or in business, and they challenged him. When he pardoned Ablyazov in 2003 and allowed him to return to business in exchange for a promise not to be involved in politics and then found out that he was again involved in politics, of course Nazarbaev felt betrayed twice.”&lt;ref name=rferl /&gt;

While living in [[Russia]] and Kazakhstan, Ablyazov was the target of assassination attempts and an effort was made to kidnap his son from school.&lt;ref name=Standard&gt;{{cite web|last=Cheston|first=Paul|title=Living in fear in London: the exiled Kazakh banker accused of $2 billion fraud|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/living-in-fear-in-london-the-exiled-kazakh-banker-accused-of-2-billion-fraud-6506705.html|publisher=London Evening Standard|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BTA Bank efforts===
Shortly thereafter, Kazakhstan's sovereign wealth fund, Samruk-Kazyna, injected significant funds into BTA in an effort to keep the bank solvent, effectively becoming its majority shareholder.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt;

It has been argued that BTA Bank “threatened to dominate the other Kazakh banks – banks that Nazarbayev controlled” and that the bank's forced nationalization in 2009 was part of an effort by Nazarbayev “to dispose of Ablyazov.”&lt;ref name=mukhtar&gt;{{cite web|title=Mukhtar Ablyazov has experienced first hand the political persecution and absence of law in Kazakhstan under President Nursultan Nazarbayev|url=http://www.mukhtar-ablyazov.com/|publisher=Friends of Ablyazov|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Living in United Kingdom===
Following the issuing of the Kazakh warrant, Ablyazov left Kazakhstan for [[London]].&lt;ref name=rian&gt;{{cite web|title=British Court Orders Fugitive Kazakh Banker to Pay $2.1 Bln|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20121123/177701543.html|publisher=Rianovosti|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made him, according to RFE/RL, one of “dozens of former high-ranking Kazakh officials who have fled abroad after falling out of favor.”&lt;ref name=rferl /&gt;

During his time in London, Ablyazov told ''The Standard'' that he was an “innocent...victim of persecution” by Nazarbaev and was “in fear of his life from his country's secret police, the KNB.”&lt;ref name=Standard /&gt;
Claiming to be innocent of all charges, he “employed tight security to protect him from murder attempts” while living in London.&lt;ref name=business&gt;{{cite web|last=Wachtel|first=Katya|title=Exiled Kazakh Banker Says The Government Is Trying To Kill Him|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/mukhtar-ablyazov-bta-bank-2010-8|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once, while he was being driven in London, a car “rammed his vehicle repeatedly.”&lt;ref name=Standard /&gt;

While in Britain, Ablyazov maintained close ties to opposition media in Kazakhstan. RFE/RL has noted that in 2011, the broadcaster K+ and the newspapers Vzglyad and Golos Respubliki, along with other private Kazakh media with ties to Ablyazov, “gave full-scale coverage to the bloody police crackdown on striking oil workers in the western city of Zhanaozen.” Not long after, Kazakh courts ordered these media outlets closed, along with the opposition Algha party, headed by Avladimir Kozlov, an Ablyazov ally, who was sentenced to a long prison term. The Nazarbaev regime reportedly considered Ablyazov to be implicated in these media outlets' critical coverage of the regime.&lt;ref name=rferl /&gt;

Also during his time in Britain, Ablyazov was the main source of funding for Aksara, an independent theater company whose productions challenge the Nazarbaev regime and seek to provide an alternative to the state-subsidized theater, which toes the government line.&lt;ref name=IPS&gt;{{cite web|last=Lillis|first=Joanna|title=Theatre with a Political Edge in Kazakhstan|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/05/theatre-with-a-political-edge-in-kazakhstan/|publisher=IPS News|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a British judge ordered Ablyazov imprisoned for purportedly lying in court about his financial assets.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Neate|first=Rupert|title=Arrest warrant for Kazakh billionaire accused of one of world's biggest frauds|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/16/arrest-warrant-kazakh-billionaire-mukhtar-ablyazov|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=13 June 2013|location=London|date=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Ablyazov left Britain. It was charged that he exited the country in order to avoid imprisonment. His lawyers, however, said that he left because he had received a death threat. The lawyers further maintained that Ablyazov “did not embezzle the $6 billion claimed by the Kazakh government, but restructured the bank's holdings in order to protect them from precisely the kind of government takeover that took place in 2009.”&lt;ref name=rferl /&gt;

Since his departure from Britain, it has been unclear where Ablyazov is living, although he was widely believed to have gone to [[France]].&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|last=Russell|first=Jonathan|title=Banker Mukhtar Ablyazov 'fled to France on coach'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financial-crime/9104787/Banker-Mukhtar-Ablyazov-fled-to-France-on-coach.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=13 June 2013|location=London|date=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deportation of Ablyazov's wife and daughter===

According to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), the explanation for this action was that Nazarbaev was taking them as “political hostages.”  Ablyazov’s oldest daughter, Madina, told RFE/RL that Nazarbaev wants to get his hands on Ablyazov. “Not as a hostage. Probably, the minute they have him, they will just kill him. They want to kill him, because my father is the biggest opponent for the president.”&lt;ref name=rferl /&gt; Ablyazov's lawyer, Riccardo Olivo, rejected the claim that Ablyazov's wife and child had false papers, saying that both of them had “valid Kazakh passports and EU residency permits issued by Latvia.”

Olivio also charged that their rapid deportation from Italy “raised suspicions that Italian and Kazakh authorities had colluded on the deal.” A lawyer close to the Ablyazov family said: “A person could get arrested committing a violent crime in broad daylight and get better due process than they did.” Italy's Justice Ministry claims to have been unaware of the arrests and deportation until after the fact; Emma Bonino, the Italian Foreign Minister, has called the operation “abnormal.” Ablyazov, for his part, accused Nazarbaev of “kidnapping” his wife and child and of employing “outright terrorist tactics.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/0d35c07c-e57f-11e2-ad1a-00144feabdc0.html|title=Deportation of Kazakh mother and child shakes Italy|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian media blamed the Interior Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister of Italy, Angelino Alfano simultaneously,, for the illegal deportation. He is also a member of the centre-right party ‘The People of Freedom’ headed by Silvio Berlusconi, known for his friendly relations with the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev.

The president of Italy, Giorgio Napolitano, expressed his stark criticism of the deportation of Alma Shalabayeva. He noted that the decision to deport her was made without necessary verification or thorough examination of the situation by the Italian bodies: “For any country, it is unacceptable to give in to the pressure and interference of foreign diplomacy, which resulted in the hasty expulsion of a mother and child from Italy on the basis of distorted information. I also believe that we need to fully guarantee fundamental rights of persons, regardless of the status which they have in our country”.

On 24 December 2013, a representative of the Kazakh Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced a change in the restriction of liberty measure for Alma Shalabayeva and the withdrawal of her prohibition from leaving Almaty. Shalabayeva and her daughter, Alua received their passports and left Kazakhstan.

On 18 April 2014, the Italian authorities granted Ablyazov’s wife and daughter refugee status. Alma and Alua received a 5-year renewable permit of stay. The decision on the award of refugee status was made by the Territorial Commission in Rome for Recognition of International Protection, under Article 1 of the Geneva Convention.

===Ablyazov supporters===
From July 2013 to December 2016, Ablyazov was detained by [[France|French]] authorities,&lt;ref name="AFPRelease"/&gt; as Russia sought Ablyazov's [[extradition]] from France, but Ablyazov argued that extradition would place him at risk of ill-treatment and an unfair trial.&lt;ref name="rferl.org"/&gt; Human rights groups [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]], as well as many members of the [[European Parliament]], wrote in opposition to extradition of Ablyazov.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt; In 2015, a French court in Lyon issued an extradition order.&lt;ref name="rferl.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Armitage"/&gt; However, in December 2016, France's [[Supreme court|highest]] administrative court, the [[Conseil d'État (France)|Conseil d'Etat]], canceled the extradition order, on the ground that Russia [[Political offence exception|had a political motive]] in making the extradition request.&lt;ref name="AFPRelease"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReutersCanceled"/&gt; Ablyazov was released from the Fleury-Merogis prison.&lt;ref name="AFPRelease"/&gt;

===Personal life===
During his time in London, Ablyazov was described as not fitting “the Western stereotype of the fabulously wealthy businessman from the old Soviet Union. No bling, no yachts, no trophy wife and no ostentatious cars, he cuts a modest figure, favouring Marks and Spencer suits.”&lt;ref name=Standard /&gt;
However, a High Court judge held Ablyazov in contempt and imposed three prison sentences for failing to disclose assets including a nine bedroom mansion in London's "Billionaire's Row" and a 100-acre estate in Windsor Great Park. He rented a 15,000 square foot mansion on Bishop's Avenue in London.&lt;ref name="mansion"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kazakh Bank Lost Billions in Western Investments|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/28/business/global/28kazakh.html?mcubz=1|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens''' is a [[botanical garden]] set in [[Schenley Park]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. It is a City of Pittsburgh historic landmark and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arch.state.pa.us/pdfs/H001763_01B.pdf | title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form: Phipps Conservatory | year=1976 | accessdate=2010-06-08}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gardens were founded in 1893 by steel and real-estate magnate [[Henry Phipps, Jr.|Henry Phipps]] as a gift to the City of Pittsburgh. Its purpose is to educate and entertain the people of Pittsburgh with formal gardens (Roman, English, etc.) and various species of exotic plants ([[Arecaceae|palm trees]], [[Succulent plant|succulents]], [[bonsai]], [[Orchidaceae|orchids]], etc.). Currently, the facilities house elaborate gardens within the fourteen room conservatory itself and on the adjoining grounds. In addition to its primary [[Flora (plants)|flora]] exhibits, the sophisticated glass and metalwork of the [[Lord &amp; Burnham]] conservatory offers an interesting example of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] greenhouse architecture.

== History ==
[[File:Phipps Conservatory 1893.jpg|thumb|The Conservatory in 1893]]
The Phipps Conservatory was founded in 1893 as a gift from [[Henry Phipps, Jr.]] to the City of [[Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref name="history-1893"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phipps.conservatory.org/visit-and-explore/explore/phipps-history/1893|publisher=Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens|title=Year: 1893, A Gift for Pittsburgh|accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservatory was designed by [[Lord &amp; Burnham]], for a fee of $100,000. The glasshouse, then consisting of nine display rooms, was completed in August 1893, one year after construction began. On December 7, 1893, the Phipps Conservatory was opened to the public, displaying many plants from the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

[[File:Phipps Conservatory Aquatic Gardens 1915.jpg|thumb|left|A postcard postmarked 1915 illustrates the Aquatic Garden.]]
Sometime after 1910, the first of the Aquatic Gardens was built. A second pool would be installed in 1939.&lt;ref name="history-1915"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phipps.conservatory.org/visit-and-explore/explore/phipps-history/1915/|publisher=Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens|title=Year: 1915, The Early Years|accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, the Conservatory was declared a [[List of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmarks|Historic Landmark]] by the [[Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation]].&lt;ref name="PHLF list" /&gt; In 1976, the Phipps Conservatory was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

In 1993, the Phipps Conservatory, which had been run by the City of Pittsburgh since 1893, became a privately managed, while city owned, [[non-profit organization]].&lt;ref name="history-1993"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phipps.conservatory.org/visit-and-explore/explore/phipps-history/1993/|publisher=Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens|title=Year: 1993, Transformation|accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2003, Phipps announced an expansion project. The first phase, a [[Green building|green]] engineered Welcome Center topped by a neo-Victorian dome, was designed by IKM Incorporated, and completed in 2005. The Production Greenhouses and a Tropical Forest Conservatory were completed in 2006.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}
[[File:Phipps Conservatory 36.jpg|thumb|The Welcome Center, completed in 2005, features a neo-Victorian dome illuminated by a [[Dale Chihuly|Chihuly]] chandelier.]]
The Tropical Forest conservatory has a different theme every three years, beginning with the country of Thailand. In addition to a "Research Forest Station" and a "Healer's Hut" (designed to educate visitors about various cultural topics), there are two waterfalls, several bridges, a stream, and a wide variety of plants from bamboo, orchids and frangipani to plants of economic, cultural, and horticultural value to the people of Thailand. The second theme is "Headwaters of the Amazon," which opened in early 2009. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

[[Image:Phipps2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|An example of a [[Dale Chihuly]] art glass installation at the Phipps Conservatory in 2007]]
In 2007, Phipps teamed with glass artist [[Dale Chihuly]] and his [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]]-based team of glass blowers. They worked together to create a marriage of hand-blown glass and living plants. Following the closing of the exhibit in February, the conservatory retained four prominent pieces (the Welcome Center [[chandelier]], the hanging gold star in the Desert Room, the [[celadon]] and purple gilded Fiori in the Tropical Fruit and Spice Room and the bronze, apricot and chartreuse Ikebana in the Palm Court) and subsequently purchased 26 smaller pieces for its permanent collection including six multicolored Macchia (wavy, shell-like bowls), thirteen amber Cattails and seven Paintbrushes, all of which are installed in the Palm Court. The total Chihuly collection is valued at $1.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08192/895985-437.stm PG: Chihuly works will become permanent fixtures at Phipps, July 10, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Phipps teamed with another glass artist [[Hans Godo Frabel]] to create another stunning exhibit titled "Gardens and Glass." Unlike the Chihuly pieces, Frabel's work is more realistic, although still whimsical at times. Highlights of this exhibit include Longfellows, intricate glass orchid and lotus plants and various clowns (balancing on either glass playing cards or colored glass balls.) This collaboration was on display until January 2010.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

== Indoor Gardens ==

=== Palm Court ===
[[File:Phipps Conservatory 14.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Paper cranes on display in the Palm Court]]

The Palm Court is the first room visitors see after entering the Conservatory through the main entrance. The Victorian-inspired room contains many species of [[Arecaceae|palm trees]].&lt;ref name="palm"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phipps.conservatory.org/visit-and-explore/explore/online-tour/palm-court/|publisher=Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens|title=Palm Court|accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The room contains the original dated plaque from the Conservatory's opening as well as numerous glass installations by [[Dale Chihuly]]. To accommodate the palm trees, the Palm Court has a high glass peak.

The original wood and annealed glass in the Palm Court had deteriorated to a point for the need of emergency stabilization in 2008.&lt;ref name="palmcourtrenovations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montgomerysmithinc.com/?p=463|publisher=Montgomery Smith Inc.|title=Phipps Conservatory – Palm Court Renovations|accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renovations began in 1992 and included replacing the upper wood and glass vent sash with aluminum and safety glass, and replacing the vertical wood and glass components with new replicated aluminum extrusions and safety glass glazing to match the original specifications exactly.

=== Serpentine Room ===
[[File:Phipps Conservatory winter 2015 Serpentine Room.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|The Serpentine Room during the winter flower show]]
The Serpentine Room is located west of the Palm Court, connecting it to the Fern Room.&lt;ref name="serpentine"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phipps.conservatory.org/visit-and-explore/explore/online-tour/serpentine-room/|publisher=Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens|title=Serpentine Room|accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibits in the room change with the season for different shows and special exhibits. The room is named for its curved brick-walled pathway. Plants are lined along either side of the pathway, as well as suspended from the peaked ceiling.

The room was originally known as the Border Garden, which was redesigned as the present-day Serpentine Room during an 18-month period of extensive renovations starting in 1978.&lt;ref name="history-1978"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phipps.conservatory.org/visit-and-explore/explore/phipps-history/1978/|publisher=Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens|title=Year: 1978, Transformation|accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, the region features the Tropical Forest Congo exhibit.&lt;ref name="congo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phipps.conservatory.org/calendar/detail/tropical-forest-congo|publisher=Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens|title=Tropical Forest Congo|accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tropical Forest Conservatory opened on December 6, 2006.&lt;ref name="iisbe"&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://iisbe.org/iisbe/sbc2k8/teams/SBC08_world/SBC08_USA/SBC08_USA_OFFICE_Conservatory.pdf||conference=World Sustainable Building Conference 2008|title=Tropical Forest Conservatory, Pittsburgh, PA, USA|publisher=International Initiative for a Sustainable Built Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tropical Forest Conservatory has several interesting features, which make it extremely energy-efficient. It has "[[earth tubes]]" running underground to help cool the tropical forest and a [[solid oxide fuel cell]], which efficiently produces 5&amp;nbsp;kW of electricity from natural gas. In addition, there are computer-controlled shades that block excess sunlight from entering the structure and also help to insulate it at night. The roof is also computer-controlled and many of the glass panes can be opened.

[[File:Post Mart logo.png|thumb|Company logo]]

'''Post Mart''' is a joint-venture between [[China Post Group]] and U.S.-owned China Horizon Investments Group.



Post Mart provides consumer goods to people in rural China using the existing China Post network of hundreds of thousands of village postal stations as well as a network of distribution centers.



In January 2016 China Horizon Investments sued China Post for fraud and breach of contract in relation to this venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Freifeld |first=Karen |date=13 January 2016 |title=China Post Group sued by investors in joint venture |publisher=[[Reuters]] |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/china-post-lawsuit-idUSL2N14X2FM20160113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
China Horizon Investments Group was founded in January 2007 by Alan Clingman for the purpose of investing in the growth of Chinese domestic consumption projects alongside major Chinese entities, especially state-owned entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chan |first1=Savio |last2=Zakkour |first2=Michael |year=2014 |title=China's Super Consumers: What 1 Billion Customers Want and How to Sell it to Them |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |pages=123-126 |isbn=9781118834749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China Post is the official postal service of China. The State Post Bureau of the People's Republic of China, the owner of China Post, is both a regulatory authority and government-owned enterprise. Thus, it is responsible for the regulation of the national postal industry and the management of national postal enterprises. China Post also owns one of China’s largest banks, the EMS courier service, an insurance company and a large-scale distribution business.

Following a multi-year pilot program, regulatory approvals for the China Horizon and China Post Joint Venture were granted in September 2015.

The scope of the joint venture is to build a modern distribution system for consumer products, expanding upon the extensive China Post network in order to bring a variety of safe, affordable and appropriate products (including a wide selection of Post Mart branded products) to rural China with the added ambition of improving the lives of rural citizens.




The joint venture has a registered capital of RMB 1 billion and has a license to use the China Post brand.

== Operations ==
Post Mart has established an efficient route to market sales and delivery system in Henan. It plans to roll this out nationally, reaching 10 provinces within five years. There are currently more than 50,000 village postal stations in Henan.

Post Mart operates a loyalty program called the Post Mart Emerald Club.

== Products ==
Post Mart provides a range of daily supply products such as cooking oil, rice, household goods, personal items and beverages such as Coca-Cola. Their brands include Chinese brands, international brands and its own brand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3419">'''RenewableUK''', formerly known as the 'British Wind Energy Association' (BWEA), is the [[Industry trade group|trade association]] for [[wind power]], [[wave power]] and [[tidal power]] industries in the [[United Kingdom]]. RenewableUK has over 660 corporate members, from wind, wave and tidal stream power generation and associated industries.

The association carries out research, and co-ordinates statistics and intelligence on marine and wind power in the UK and its [[Exclusive Economic Zone|waters]]. It also represents its members internationally, and to Government, regional bodies and local authorities in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==History==
A number of [[university|universities]] active in wind energy in the 1970s met under umbrella of the ITDG Wind Panel (Intermediate Technology Development Group). The BWEA was formed from the ITDG Wind Panel along with other interested parties and representatives from industry, to promote [[wind power in the United Kingdom]]. The inaugural meeting of the BWEA took place on 17 November 1978 at the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory|Rutherford Laboratory]] with [[Peter Musgrove]] of [[Reading University]] as chairman.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In 2004 the British Wind Energy Association expanded its remit to include wave and tidal energy, and to use the Association's experience to guide these technologies along the same path to commercialisation.  In December 2009, to reflect this expansion in the industries it represented, members resolved to adopt the new name of RenewableUK.

===Advertising Standards Authority ruling===

In 2008 the then BWEA was found by the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) to have overstated the carbon dioxide emissions displaced by wind generation. The BWEA and its members had claimed a value of 860 grams per kilowatt hour but the ASA found this was exaggerated by 100% and ordered the BWEA to reduce the figure to 430 grams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/windpower/3867232/Promoters-overstated-the-environmental-benefit-of-wind-farms.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Patrick | last=Sawer | title=Promoters overstated the environmental benefit of wind farms | date=2008-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Resource Conservation and Recovery Act''' ('''RCRA'''), enacted in 1976, is the principal [[federal law]] in the [[United States]] governing the disposal of [[solid waste]] and [[hazardous waste]].&lt;ref name="RCRA statute"&gt;Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, P.L. 94-580, {{USStat|90|2795}}, {{USC|42|6901}} ''et seq.,'' October 21, 1976. [http://epw.senate.gov/rcra.pdf RCRA Full text.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and goals==
[[United States Congress|Congress]] enacted RCRA to address the increasing problems the nation faced from its growing volume of municipal and industrial waste. RCRA amended the [[Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965]]. It set national goals for:
* Protecting [[human health]] and the [[natural environment]] from the potential hazards of waste disposal.
* [[Energy conservation]] and [[natural resource]]s.
* Reducing the amount of waste generated, through [[source reduction]] and [[recycling]]
* Ensuring the [[waste management|management of waste]] in an environmentally sound manner.&lt;ref name="EPA-RCRA History"&gt;EPA (2010). [http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/laws-regs/rcrahistory.htm "History of RCRA."]&lt;/ref&gt;
It is now most widely known for the regulations promulgated under RCRA that set standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of [[hazardous waste]] in the United States.

==Implementation==
The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has published waste management [[regulation]]s, which are codified in [[Title&amp;nbsp;40 of the Code of Federal Regulations]] at parts 239 through 282.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2011). [http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/laws-regs/regs-non-haz.htm "Non-hazardous Waste Regulations."]&lt;/ref&gt; Regulations regarding management of hazardous waste begin in part 260.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2011). [http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/laws-regs/regs-haz.htm "Hazardous Waste Regulations."]&lt;/ref&gt; As noted below, most [[U.S. state|states]] have enacted laws and created regulations that are at least as stringent as the federal regulations. Furthermore, the RCRA statute authorizes states to carry out many of the functions of the federal law through their own hazardous waste programs (as well as their state laws) if such programs have been approved by the EPA.

==Provisions==

===Subtitle A: General Provisions===
* Congressional Findings; Objectives and National Policy
* Definitions
* Interstate Cooperation; Application of Act and Integration with Other Acts
* Financial Disclosure; Solid Waste Management Information and Guidelines

===Subtitle B: Office of Solid Waste; Authorities of the Administrator===
* Office of Solid Waste and Interagency Coordinating Committee
* Authorities of EPA Administrator
* Resource Recovery and Conservation Panels; Grants
* Annual Report; Office of Ombudsman

===Subtitle C: "Cradle to Grave" requirements===
Arguably the most notable provisions of the RCRA statute are included in Subtitle C, which directs EPA to establish controls on the management of hazardous wastes from their point of generation, through their transportation and treatment, storage and/or disposal. Because RCRA requires controls on hazardous waste generators (i.e., sites that generate hazardous waste), transporters, and treatment, storage and disposal facilities (i.e., facilities that ultimately treat/dispose of or recycle the hazardous waste), the overall regulatory framework has become known as the "cradle to grave" system. The program imposes stringent recordkeeping and reporting requirements on generators, transporters, and operators of treatment, storage and disposal facilities handling hazardous waste.

===Subtitle D: Non-hazardous Solid Wastes===
Non-hazardous solid wastes include certain hazardous wastes which are exempted from the Subtitle&amp;nbsp;C regulations, such as hazardous wastes from households and from conditionally exempt small quantity generators. Oil and gas exploration and production wastes, such as drill cuttings, produced water, and drilling fluids are categorized as "special wastes" and are also exempt from Subtitle C.&lt;ref name="RCRA statute" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/industrial/special/oil/oil-gas.pdf|title = Exemption of Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Wastes from Federal Hazardous Waste Regulations| publisher=Environmental Protection Agency Office of Solid Waste (5305W)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subtitle&amp;nbsp;D also includes garbage (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;food containers, coffee grounds), non-recycled household appliances, residue from incinerated automobile tires, refuse such as metal scrap, construction materials, and [[sludge]] from [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial]] and [[sewage treatment|municipal]] waste water facilities and [[water purification|drinking water treatment]] plants.

===Subtitle E: Department of Commerce responsibilities===
* Development of Specifications for secondary materials; Development of markets for recovered material.
* Technology promotion

===Subtitle F: Federal responsibilities===
* Application of Federal, State and Local Law to Federal Facilities
* Federal procurement
* Cooperation with EPA; Applicability of solid waste disposal guidelines to executive agencies

===Subtitle G: Miscellaneous provisions===
* [[Whistleblower]] protection. Employees in the United States who believe they were fired or suffered another adverse action related to enforcement of this law have 30 days to file a written complaint with the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]].
* Citizen Suits; Imminent Hazard suits
* Petition for regulations; Public participation

===Subtitle H: Research, Development, Demonstration and Information===
* Research, Demonstrations, Training; Special Studies
* Coordination, collection, dissemination of information

===Subtitle I: Underground Storage Tanks===
;Background
The operation of [[underground storage tanks]] (USTs) became subject to the RCRA regulatory program with enactment of the [[Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984]] (HSWA).&lt;ref name="HSWA statute"&gt;Hazardous and Solid Wastes Amendments of 1984, P.L. 98-616, {{USStat|98|3224}}, November 8, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time there were about 2.1 million tanks subject to federal regulation, and the EPA program led to closure and removal of most substandard tanks.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2011). [http://www.epa.gov/oust/overview.htm "Overview Of The Federal UST Program."]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009 there were approximately 600,000 active USTs at 223,000 sites subject to federal regulation.&lt;ref name="EPA UST 2009"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, D.C. (2010). [http://www.epa.gov/oust/pubs/fy09_annual_ust_report_3-10.pdf "FY 2009 Annual Report On The Underground Storage Tank Program."] Document no. EPA-510-R-10-001.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Regulatory requirements
The federal UST regulations cover tanks storing [[petroleum]] or listed hazardous substances, and define the [[Underground storage tank#Tank types|types]] of tanks permitted. EPA established a tank notification system to track UST status. UST regulatory programs are principally administered by state and U.S. territorial agencies.&lt;ref name="EPA UST Basic"&gt;EPA (2009). [http://www.epa.gov/oust/aboutust.htm "Basic information about the Underground Storage Tank Program."]&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulations set standards for:
* [[Groundwater]] monitoring
* Double liners
* Release detection, prevention and correction
* Spill control
* Overfill control (for petroleum products)
* Restrictions on [[Land disposal unit|land disposal]] of untreatable hazardous waste products.

The [[Superfund|Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986]] (SARA) required owners and operators of USTs to ensure corrective action is completed when a tank is in need of repair, or removal, when it is necessary to protect human health and the environment.&lt;ref name="SARA 1986"&gt;Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, P.L. 99-499, {{USStat|100|1696}}. October 17, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also recommended that above-ground storage tanks are used whenever possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Supervisors' Safety Manual |edition=9th |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1997 |publisher=National Safety Council |location=Itasca, IL |isbn=978-0-87912-197-6 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chemicals Stored in USTs: Characteristics and Leak Detection |year=1991 |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency, Risk Reduction Engineering Laboratory |location=Washington, DC |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/2000TMBV.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=1991+Thru+1994&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D%3A%5Czyfiles%5CIndex%20Data%5C91thru94%5CTxt%5C00000015%5C2000TMBV.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%7C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&amp;Display=p%7Cf&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1&amp;SeekPage=x&amp;ZyPURL#}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subtitle J: Medical Waste (expired)===
RCRA Subtitle J regulated medical waste in four states ([[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Connecticut]], [[Rhode Island]]) and [[Puerto Rico]], and expired on March 22, 1991. (''See'' [[Medical Waste Tracking Act]].)&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2010). [http://www.epa.gov/waste/nonhaz/industrial/medical/tracking.htm "Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988."] 2010-01-20.&lt;/ref&gt; If determined to be hazardous, medical waste is currently regulated by RCRA Subtitle C for hazardous wastes.

==Amendments and related legislation==
The [[Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act]] (CERCLA), also known as "Superfund," was enacted in 1980 to address the problem of remediating abandoned hazardous waste sites, by establishing [[legal liability]], as well as a trust fund for cleanup activities.&lt;ref&gt;Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, P.L. 96-510, {{USStat|94|2767}}, {{USC|42|9601}} ''et seq.,'' December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; In general CERCLA applies to contaminated sites, while RCRA's focus is on controlling the ongoing generation and management of particular waste streams. RCRA, like CERCLA, has provisions to require cleanup of contaminated sites that occurred in the past.

In 1984 Congress expanded the scope of RCRA with the enactment of Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA).&lt;ref name="HSWA statute" /&gt; The amendments strengthened the law by covering small quantity generators of hazardous waste and establishing requirements for hazardous waste [[incineration|incinerators]], and the closing of substandard [[landfills]].&lt;ref name="EPA-RCRA History" /&gt;

In 1986, SARA addressed cleanup of leaking USTs and other leaking waste storage facilities.&lt;ref name="SARA 1986" /&gt; The amendments established a [[trust (property)|trust]] fund to pay for the cleanup of leaking UST sites where responsible parties cannot be identified.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2011). [http://www.epa.gov/oust/ltffacts.htm "Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund."]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Add discussion of other SARA provisions (1986) --&gt;

The Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act of 1996 allowed some flexibility in the procedures for land disposal of certain wastes. For example, a waste is not subject to land disposal restrictions if it is sent to an [[industrial wastewater treatment]] facility, a municipal [[sewage treatment]] plant, or is treated in a "zero discharge" facility.&lt;ref&gt;Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act of 1996, P.L. 104-119, {{USStat|110|830}}, {{USC|42|6924}}. March 26, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill [[Reducing Excessive Deadline Obligations Act of 2013 (H.R. 2279; 113th Congress)]], which made it to the House floor in January 2014, would amend this law "to remove a requirement that the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) review and revise regulations declared under such Act at least every three years."&lt;ref name=2279sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 2279 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th/house-bill/2279|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment, storage, and disposal facility permits==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
Treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs) manage hazardous waste under RCRA Subtitle C and generally must have a permit in order to operate. While most facilities have RCRA permits, some continue to operate under what is called "interim status."  Interim status requirements appear in 40 CFR Part 265.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=385ea9ac5d6e0fb83be2351f0836eb09&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=40:25.0.1.1.6&amp;idno=40 "Part 265 – Interim Status Standards For Owners And Operators Of Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, And Disposal Facilities."] {{USCFR|40|265}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The permitting requirements for TSDFs appear in 40 CFR Parts 264 and 270.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=385ea9ac5d6e0fb83be2351f0836eb09&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=40:25.0.1.1.5&amp;idno=40 "Part 264 – Standards For Owners And Operators Of Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, And Disposal Facilities."] {{USCFR|40|264}}.&lt;br/&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=58204e14b6f985f03d09f71e683c830c&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=40:26.0.1.1.4&amp;idno=40 "Part 270 – EPA Administered Permit Programs: The Hazardous Waste Permit Program ."] {{USCFR|40|270}}.&lt;/ref&gt; TSDFs manage (treat, store, or dispose) hazardous waste in units that may include: container storage areas, tanks, surface impoundments, waste piles, land treatment units, landfills, incinerators, containment buildings, and/or drip pads. The unit-specific permitting and operational requirements are described in further detail in 40 CFR Part 264, Subparts J through DD.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3053">'''Richard Beckhard''' (1918–1999) was an American [[organizational theorist]], [[Adjunct Professor#Adjunct professor|Adjunct Professor]] at MIT, and  pioneer in the field of [[organization development]].

Beckhard co-launched the ''Addison-Wesley Organization Development Series'' and began the ''Organization Development Network'' in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odnetwork.org/ Organization Development Network]&lt;/ref&gt;  His classic work,  ''Organization Development: Strategies and Models,'' was published in 1969.  Beckhard was an adjunct professor at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] from 1963-1984.  He died on December 28, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2000/beckhard-0126.html Richard Beckhard Obituary, MIT]&lt;/ref&gt;

He helped to define [[organization development]] as: "an effort (1) planned, (2) organization-wide, (3) managed from the top, to (4) increase organization effectiveness and health through (5) planned interventions in the organization's 'processes', using behavioural-science knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Beckhard, R., 1969, p. 9. Organization Development: Strategies and Models&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with [[David Gleicher]], he is credited with developing a [[Formula for Change]].  The formula proposes that the combination of organisational dissatisfaction, vision for the future and the possibility of immediate, tactical action must be stronger than the resistance within the organisation in order for meaningful change to occur.

Beckhard is also credited for developing the ''GRPI model'' which highlights four key conditions (Growth, Roles, Processes, Interpersonal) for team effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Beckhard, R. (1972). Optimizing Team Building Efforts. Journal of Contemporary Business, pp. 23–27. Credit to Beckhard and citation as under: {{cite web|author=Douglas O’Loughlin|url=http://www.cscollege.gov.sg/Knowledge/Pages/Creating-Teams-That-Work.aspx|title=Creating Teams That Work — A Position Paper on Team Effectiveness|date=August 2013|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SME Toolkit''' is a project of [[International Finance Corporation]] (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, that - in partnership with [[IBM]] - helps entrepreneurs and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) all over the world to learn and implement sustainable business management practices and increase their productivity, efficiency, and capacity, as well as improve their access to finance and new markets.

== Content ==

=== Global Content ===
SME Toolkit consists of a large body of globally relevant free content for SMEs provided by content partners, and includes over 5,000 business forms, tools, how-to-articles, business software and advice about starting and growing a business. The areas covered include accounting, finance, human resources, international business, legal, insurance, marketing, sales, operations and technology. SME Toolkit collaborates with major global partners, including [[IBM]], [[ICICI Bank]], [[American Express]], My Own Business, and [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] to offer users a large set of small business content, and a number of other services.

=== Local Content ===
In addition to global content, SME Toolkit local websites offer information on local business news, events, and regulations. Users can register and log in, find business partners, list in an online SME directory, create a hosted web page for their business, and participate in multilingual social networks on key business topics. IFC partners with key institutions in target local markets to manage, localize and distribute localized versions of the Toolkit.

== Features ==

=== Training Curriculum ===
The Toolkit also offers a business training curriculum on improving business management practices and overall business performance using computer-based tools. The workshops are available to business development service (BDS) providers and SMEs in key markets.

==History of Statements on Auditing Procedure==
The history of the Statements on Auditing Procedures began in 1917 when the American Institute of Accountants (the predecessor organization for the AICPA) was asked by the Federal Trade Commission to  prepare a "memorandum on balance-sheet audits." The resulting document was published in the April 1917 issue of the [[Federal Reserve Bulletin]]&lt;ref&gt;"Uniform Accounting: a tentative proposal submitted by the Federal Reserve Board." ''[[Federal Reserve Bulletin]]'' April 1917 [http://umiss.lib.olemiss.edu:82/record=b1010875 full-test]&lt;/ref&gt; and reissued in 1918 as a pamphlet.&lt;ref&gt;''Approved methods for the preparation of balance sheet statements.'' 1918 [http://umiss.lib.olemiss.edu:82/record=b1010874 full-text]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929 the pamphlet was again revised.&lt;ref&gt;''Verification of financial statements.'' United States. Federal Reserve Board, 1929 [http://umiss.lib.olemiss.edu:82/record=b1012357 full-text]&lt;/ref&gt; A third revision was done in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;''Examination of financial statements by independent public accountants.'' American Institute of Accountants, 1936 [http://umiss.lib.olemiss.edu:82/record=b1035146 full-text]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Institute determined that, rather than reissuing the 1936 pamphlet, it would, through the Committee on Auditing Procedure, issue Statements on Auditing Procedure that modified and superseded parts of the 1936 pamphlet.  The SAPs were "designed to guide the auditor in those areas of specific situations encountered in practice in which he must exercise judgment, situations outside the realm of textbooks, whose function is inherently to describe procedures in general."&lt;ref&gt;''Codification of statements on auditing procedure, based on statements 1 to 24 (1939 to 1949).'' American Institute of Accountants, 1951, p. 7 [http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/u?/deloitte,11723 full-text]&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1948, the 1936 pamphlet was considered so out-of-date that it was withdrawn from publication.  

In 1951, the first 24 ''Statements on Auditing Procedure'' were codified &lt;ref&gt;''Codification of Statements on Auditing Procedure, Based on Statements 1 to 24 (1939 to 1949).'' American Institute of Accountants, 1951 [http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/u?/deloitte,11723 full-text]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Codification'' also contains a summary history of the process of standardizing auditing practice up to 1951 (see pp.&amp;nbsp;5–8).  

In 1954, the Committee on Auditing Procedure finished work on the booklet ''Generally Accepted Auditing Standards: Their Significance and Scope.''&lt;ref&gt;''Generally Accepted Auditing Standards: Their Significance and Scope.'' American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, 1954 [http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/u?/deloitte,40861 full-text]&lt;/ref&gt; This publication responded to the Securities and Exchange Commission's recommendation that the auditor's report make a representation as to compliance with generally accepted auditing standards.&lt;ref&gt;''Codification of statements on auditing procedure, based on statements 1 to 24 (1939 to 1949).'' American Institute of Accountants, 1951, p. 6 [http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/u?/deloitte,11723 full-text]&lt;/ref&gt;

Statement on Procedure no. 33 again codified previous Committee on Auditing Procedure publications, including the 1951 ''Codification'', The 1954 ''Generally Accepted Auditing Standards,'' and ''Statements on Auditing Procedure'' 25-32.

The final publication of the Committee on Auditing procedure, ''Codification of Auditing Standards and Procedures 1,''&lt;ref&gt;''Statement on Auditing Standards, no. 1.'' American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, 1973 [http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/u?/SAS,0 full-text]&lt;/ref&gt; superseded SAPs 33-54. The Statement is now known as ''Statement on Auditing Standards, no. 1'' and began a series of Statements on Auditing Standards'' (SASs) that are still being issued by the Auditing Standards Board. See [[Statements on Auditing Standards (USA)]].  Beginning in 1976, these Standards were codified annually as section AU of the ''AICPA's Professional Standards.''
