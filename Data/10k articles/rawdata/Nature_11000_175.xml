'''(410777) 2009 FD''' is a carbonaceous sub-kilometer [[asteroid]] and [[Binary asteroid|binary system]],&lt;ref name="CBAT4191"/&gt;&lt;ref name="johnstonsarchive" /&gt; classified as [[near-Earth object]] and [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]], discovered on 24 February 2009, by astronomers of the [[Spacewatch]] program at [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] near Tucson, Arizona, in the United States.&lt;ref name="MPC-object"/&gt;

The asteroid's orbit places it at risk of a possible future collision with [[Earth]] in 2185. It has the third highest cumulative [[Impact event|impact threat]] of all known asteroids on the [[Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale]] based on its estimated diameter of 160 meters, kinetic yield, impact probability, and time interval.&lt;ref name="risk-table"&gt;[https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/sentry/ Sentry Risk Table] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121035736/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/ |date=January 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery==

{{mp|2009 FD}} was initially announced as discovered on 16 March 2009 by [[Observatorio Astronómico de La Sagra|La Sagra Sky Survey]].&lt;ref name="MPEC2009-F09"/&gt; Because there were previous observations found in images taken by the [[Spacewatch]] survey some 3 weeks prior, on 24 February 2009, the [[Minor Planet Center]] assigned the discovery credit to [[Spacewatch]] under the discovery assignment rules.&lt;ref name="MPEC2010-U20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-object"/&gt; {{mp|2009 FD}} made a close pass to Earth on 27 March 2009 at a distance of {{convert|0.004172|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}}&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iceinspace.com.au/forum/showthread.php?t=42946 Near Earth Asteroid 2009 FD - whilst you were sleeping! (ice in space)]&lt;/ref&gt; and another on 24 October 2010 at 0.0702 AU.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt; {{mp|2009 FD}} was recovered at [[apparent magnitude]] 23{{efn|name=visibillity}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 30 November 2013 by [[Cerro Paranal Observatory]],&lt;ref name="MPC-object"/&gt; several months before the close approach of April 2014 when it passed 0.1 AU from Earth.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt; It brightened to roughly apparent magnitude 19.3 around mid-March 2014.&lt;ref name="NEODyS2014"/&gt; One [[radar astronomy|radar]] Doppler observation of {{mp|2009 FD}} was made in 2014.&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt; The October–November 2015 Earth approach will be studied by the [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone Deep Space Network]].&lt;ref name="Goldstone-sch"/&gt;

== Binary ==

NASA's Near Earth Program originally estimated its size to be 130 metres in diameter based on an assumed [[Albedo#Astronomical albedo|albedo]] of 0.15.&lt;ref name=Wayback110111/&gt; This gave it an estimated mass of around 2,800,000 tonnes.&lt;ref name=Wayback110111/&gt; But work by [[Amy Mainzer]] using [[NEOWISE]] data in 2014 showed that it could be as large as 472 metres with an albedo as low as 0.01.&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mainzer-2014" /&gt; Because {{mp|2009 FD}} (K09F00D) was only detected in two (W1&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;W2) of the four wavelengths the suspected NEOWISE diameter is more of an upper limit.&lt;ref name="Mainzer-2014" /&gt; Radar observations in 2015 showed it to be a binary asteroid.&lt;ref name="CBAT4191"/&gt; The primary is 120–180 meters in diameter and the secondary is 60–120 meters in diameter.&lt;ref name="CBAT4191"/&gt;

== Future approaches==

The [[JPL Small-Body Database]] shows that {{mp|2009 FD}} will make two very close approaches in the late 22nd century, with the approach of 29 March 2185 currently having a 1 in 710 chance of impacting Earth.&lt;ref name=summary/&gt; The [[Curve fitting|nominal]] 2185 Earth approach distance is {{convert|0.009|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}}.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt; [[Orbit determination]] for 2190 is complicated by the 2185 close approach.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt; The precise distance that it will pass from Earth and the Moon on 29 March 2185 will determine the 30 March 2190 distance. {{mp|2009 FD}} should pass closer to the Moon than Earth on 29 March 2185.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt; An impact by {{mp|2009 FD}} would cause severe devastation to a large region or tsunamis of significant size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/40/2493218.pdf |title=How a Near-Earth Object Impact Might Affect Society |date=9 January 2003 |first=Clark R. |last=Chapman |website=[[OECD]] |accessdate=14 November 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050217164636/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/40/2493218.pdf |archivedate=17 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Past Earth-impact estimates ===

In January 2011, near-Earth asteroid {{mp|2009 FD}} (with observations through 7 December 2010) was listed on the JPL Sentry Risk Table with a 1 in 435 chance of impacting Earth on 29 March 2185.&lt;ref name=Wayback110111/&gt; In 2014 (with observations through 5 February 2014 creating an [[observation arc]] of 1807 days) the potential 2185 impact was ruled out.&lt;ref name=Wayback140210/&gt; Using the 2014 observations, the [[Yarkovsky effect]] has become more significant than the position uncertainties.&lt;ref name="NEODyS"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spoto2014/&gt;&lt;ref name="notes"/&gt; The Yarkovsky effect has resulted in the 2185 virtual impactor returning. While {{mp|2009 FD}} was estimated to be 470 meters in diameter, it was rated −0.40 on the [[Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale|Palermo Scale]], placing it higher on the [[Sentry Risk Table]] than any other known object at the time.&lt;ref name="risk-table2016"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/ |title=Sentry Risk Table |website=NASA Near-Earth Object Program |access-date=June 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121035736/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/ |archive-date=January 21, 2016 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aeromedical Isolation Team''' (AIT, or SMART-AIT) of the [[US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]] (USAMRIID) at [[Fort Detrick, Maryland]] was a military [[rapid response team]] with worldwide airlift capability designed to safely evacuate and manage contagious patients under high-level ([[BSL-4]]) [[bio-containment]] conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher,  G. W. and E. M. Eitzen, Jr, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2640682/ “Air evacuation under high-level biosafety containment: the aeromedical isolation team”]; ''[[Emerg Infect Dis]]'', 1999: Mar-Apr; 5(2): 241–246.&lt;/ref&gt; Created in 1978,&lt;ref&gt;Marklund, LeRoy A., “Patient care in a biological safety level-4 (BSL-4) environment”; ''[[Crit Care Nurs Clin N Am]]'':  15 (2003), 245– 255.&lt;/ref&gt; during its final years the AIT was one of [[MEDCOM]]’s [[Special Medical Augmentation Response Team]]s (SMART teams) comprising a portable containment laboratory along with its transit isolators for patient transport. Contingency missions included [[bioterrorism]] scenarios as well as the extraction of scientists with exotic infections from remote sites in foreign countries. The AIT trained continuously and was often put on alert status, but only deployed for “real world” missions four times. The AIT was decommissioned in 2010 and its mission assumed by one of the [[US Air Force]]’s [[Critical Care Air Transport Team]]s (CCATTs).

==History==
The AIT was created in 1978 for purposes of contingency [[Aeromedical Evacuation|air evacuation]] of a hypothetical USAMRIID researcher who might become exposed to a highly infectious [[pathogen]] while undertaking endemic surveillance in remote areas of the world where a suspected or known disease outbreak was occurring. At the core of AIT operations was its specialized equipment, notably the [[Aircraft Transit Isolator]] (ATI). Developed by [[Vickers]] in the [[U.K.]] in the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, A.J., [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/518452 “Containment aircraft transit isolator”]; ''[[Aviat Space Environ Med]]'', 1979: Oct;50(10):1067-72.&lt;/ref&gt; — and manufactured in later years by Elwyn Roberts Isolators, [[Shropshire]], UK, until 2007 — the ATI was a self-contained unit capable of transporting a patient with a highly virulent disease and at the same time providing maximum microbiological security while full nursing care and treatment are rendered. It was designed to minimize the risk of transmission to air crews and caregivers, whether military or civilian. The interior of the isolator was maintained at a pressure negative to the external environment by a [[high-efficiency particulate air]] (HEPA) filtered blower. The isolator could be attached directly to a transfer port, situated on the external wall of the main USAMRIID building, to allow movement of the patient into a BSL-4 medical care suite without exposing the environment to the patient. While moving the isolator, team members wore protective suits and positive-pressure, HEPA-filtered [[Racal hood]]s (manufactured by [[Racal Health &amp; Safety, Inc]], [[Frederick, Maryland]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sidell|first1=Frederick R.|last2=Takafuji|first2=Ernest T.|last3=Franz|first3=David R., D.V.M.|title=Medical Aspects of Chemical and Biological Warfare|date=1997|publisher=Office of The Surgeon General Department of the Army, United States of America|url=http://www.sc-ems.com/ems/NuclearBiologicalChemical/MedicalAspectsofNBC/chapters/chapter_19.htm|accessdate=15 April 2015|chapter=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its existence the AIT was associated with a [[BSL-4]] [[Medical Containment Suite]] (MCS, called “the Slammer”) at USAMRIID for [[Intensive care unit|ICU]]-level patient care under biocontainment. The MCS was built in 1969 and became operational in 1972; it was the destination to which contagious patients were to be removed by the AIT. Over the years the scope of the AIT/MCS mission was expanded to include U.S. military personnel, the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], and U.S. citizens or foreign nationals deemed to be in need of service by the [[U.S. Department of State]]. Occasionally, the AIT trained with similar teams of foreign allies.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming-Michael, Karen (2005), [http://ww2.dcmilitary.com/dcmilitary_archives/stories/092805/37324-1.shtml “Training Day”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120000000/http://ww2.dcmilitary.com/dcmilitary_archives/stories/092805/37324-1.shtml |date=January 20, 2015 }}, ''Fort Detrick Standard'' (28 Sep 2005 issue).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{expand section|date=May 2012}}

In 2007, due to the death of Mr Roberts, the ATI and associated products ceased to be manufactured. During 2008-2010, the AIT began preliminary training with, and testing of, a new transit isolator product — the [[Patient Isolation Unit]] (PIU) — developed by the [[Gentex Corporation]] under a contract with the U.S. Air Force.

The AIT was decommissioned — along with the MCS — in 2010 and its mission was assumed by one of the [[US Air Force]]’s [[Critical Care Air Transport Team]]s (CCATTs). The Air Force’s capabilities, however, do not meet the standard of biocontainment (BSL-4) facilities,&lt;ref&gt;[[Department of Health and Human Services|DHHS]], [https://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/ ''Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories'' (BMBL), 5th edition] (2009), [[U.S. Government Printing Office]], pp 45-58.&lt;/ref&gt; but rather represent enhanced [[patient isolation]]. No BSL-4 ICU facility has replaced the Army's former MCS to date.

'''Arctic [[ecology]]''' is the scientific study of the relationships between [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[abiotic]] factors in the [[arctic]], the region north of the [[Arctic Circle]] (66 33’). This is a region characterized by stressful conditions as a result of extreme cold, low precipitation, a limited growing season (50–90 days) and virtually no sunlight throughout the winter. The Arctic consists of [[taiga]] (or [[boreal forest]]) and [[tundra]] [[biomes]], which also dominate very high elevations, even in the tropics. Sensitive [[ecosystems]] exist throughout the Arctic region, which are being impacted dramatically by [[global warming]]. The earliest inhabitants of the Arctic were the Neanderthals. Since then, many indigenous populations have inhabited the region, which continues to this day. Since the early 1900s, when Vilhjalmur Stefansson led the first major Canadian Arctic Expedition, the Arctic has been a valued area for ecological research.  In 1946, The Arctic Research Laboratory was established in Point Barrow, Alaska under the contract of the Office of Naval Research. This launched an interest in exploring the Arctic examining animal cycles, permafrost and the interactions between indigenous peoples and the Arctic ecology. During the Cold War, the Arctic became a place where the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union performed significant research that has been essential to the study of climate change in recent years. A major reason why research in the Arctic is essential for the study of climate change is because the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world as above average temperatures are predicted for Northwest Canada and Alaska. From an anthropological point of view, researchers study the native Inuit peoples of Alaska as they have become extremely accustomed to adapting to ecological and climate variability.&lt;ref&gt;Berkes, Fikret and Dyanna Jolly. “Adapting to Climate Change: Social- Ecological Resilience in a Canadian Western Arctic Community.” Conservation Ecology 5 (2001).

==Arctic environment==
To understand Arctic ecology, it is important to consider both the terrestrial and oceanic aspects of the region. A few important parts of this environment are sea ice and permafrost.

[[Sea ice]] is frozen seawater that moves with oceanic currents; it provides important habitat and a resting place for animals, particularly during the winter months. Over time, small pockets of salty seawater get trapped in the ice, and the salt is squeezed out. This causes the ice to become progressively less salty. Sea ice persists throughout the year, but there is less ice available during summer months.

Large portions of the land are also frozen during the year. [[Permafrost]] is substrate that has been frozen for a minimum of 2 years. There are two types of permafrost: discontinuous and continuous. Discontinuous permafrost is found in areas where the mean annual air temperature is only slightly below freezing ({{convert|0|°C|°F|0|disp=or}}); this forms in sheltered locations. In areas where the mean annual soil surface temperature is below {{convert|-5|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}, continuous permafrost forms. This is not limited to sheltered areas and ranges from a few inches below the surface to over {{convert|300|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} deep. The top layer is called the [[active layer]]. It thaws in the summer and is critical to plant life.

==Biomes==
Moisture and temperature are major physical drivers of natural ecosystems. The more arid and colder conditions found at higher northern latitudes (and high elevations elsewhere) support [[tundra]] and [[boreal forests]]. The water in this region is generally frozen and [[evaporation]] rates are very low. Species diversity, [[nutrient]] availability, precipitation, and average temperatures increase as you move from the tundra to boreal forests and then to [[deciduous]] [[temperate]] ecosystems, which are found south of these Arctic biomes.

===Tundra===
Tundra is found from 55 ° to 80° N latitude in North America, Eurasia and Greenland. It can be found at lower latitudes at high elevations as well. The average temperature is {{convert|-34|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}; during the summer it is less than {{convert|10|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Average precipitation ranges from {{convert|10|to|50|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}, and the permafrost is {{convert|400|-|600|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} thick. Plant species supported by tundra have small leaves, are short (74&amp;nbsp;mm to &lt;5 m), tend to be deciduous, have a high ratio of roots to shoots, and are composed mainly of perennial forbs, dwarf shrubs, grasses, lichens, and mosses.

===Boreal===
In comparison to tundra, [[boreal forest]] has a longer and warmer [[growing season]] and supports larger [[species diversity]], an increase in canopy height, vegetation density, and [[biomass]]. Boreal conditions can be found across northern North America and Eurasia. The boreal forests in the interior of the continents grow on top of permafrost due to very cold winters (see [[drunken trees]]), while much of the boreal forest has patchy permafrost or lack permafrost completely. The short (3–4 month) growing season in boreal forests is sustained by greater levels of rainfall (between {{convert|30|and|85|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} per year) than the tundra receives; This biome is dominated by closed canopy forests of evergreen conifers, especially spruces, fir, pine and tamarack with some diffuse-porous hardwoods. Shrubs, herbs, ferns, mosses, and lichens are also important species. Stand-replacing crown fires are very important to this biome, occurring as frequently as every 50–100 years in some parts.

==Adaptations to conditions==

===Humans===
Humans living in the Arctic region generally rely on warm clothing and buildings to protect them from the elements. [[Acclimatization]], or the adjustment to new conditions, appears to be the most common form of adaptation to cold environments. No genetic advantage has been found when different people groups or races are compared. There is no evidence that fat is grown in response to cold, although its presence is advantageous. Amazingly, most people living in the Arctic region live a lifestyle very connected to the environment, spending significant time outside and depending heavily on hunting and fishing.

===Other animals===
Animals that are active in the winter have [[adaptations]] for surviving the intense cold. A common example is the presence of strikingly large feet in proportion to body weight. These act like snowshoes, and can be found on animals like the [[snowshoe hare]] and caribou. Many of the animals in the Arctic are larger than their temperate counterparts ([[Bergmann’s rule]]), taking advantage of the smaller ratio of surface area to volume that comes with increasing size. This increases the ability to conserve heat. Layers of fat, plumage, and fur are also very effective [[Thermal insulation|insulators]] to help retain warmth and are common in Arctic animals including polar bears and marine mammals. Some animals also have digestive adaptations to improve their ability to digest woody plants either with or without the aid of microbial organisms. This is highly advantageous during the winter months when most soft vegetation is beneath the [[snow pack]].

Not all Arctic animals directly face the rigors of winter. Many migrate to warmer climates at lower latitudes, while others avoid the difficulties of winter by [[hibernation|hibernating]] until spring. Although these options might seem to be easy solutions to the difficulties of surviving an extreme environment, both are very expensive in terms of energy and risk of predation.

===Plants===
One of the most serious problems that plants face is ice crystal formation in the cells, which results in tissue death. Plants have two ways to resist freezing: avoid it or tolerate it. If a plant has taken the avoidance route, it has several different ways to evade freezing. It can build up insulation, have its stem close to the ground, use the insulation from snow cover, and supercool. When [[supercooling]], water is able to remain in its liquid state down to {{convert|-38|°C|°F|disp=or}} (compared to its usual {{convert|0|°C|°F|disp=or}} freezing point). After water reaches {{convert|-38|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}, it spontaneously freezes and plant tissue is destroyed. This is called the [[nucleation point]]. The nucleation point can be lowered if dissolved [[solution|solute]]s are present.

If a plant has taken the tolerance route, it has several different ways to tolerate freezing. Some plants allow freezing by allowing [[extracellular]], but not [[intracellular]] freezing. Plants let water freeze in extracellular spaces, which creates a high vapor deficit that pulls water vapor out of the cell. This process dehydrates the cell and allows it to survive temperatures well below {{convert|-38|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}.

Another problem associated with extreme cold is cavitation. Ring-porous wood is susceptible to [[cavitation]] because the large pores that are used for water transport easily freeze. [[Cavitation]] is much less of problem in trees with [[ring-diffuse]] wood. In ring-diffuse wood, there is a reduced risk of cavitation, as transport pores are smaller. The trade-off is that these species are not able to transport water as efficiently.

==History of Arctic ecology==

===Early history===
Many different peoples had inhabited present-day [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] by AD 1000. Most of these people lived by hunting, gathering and fishing and never; [[agriculture]] was never done often in the region. Most of these peoples were [[nomad]]ic and their activity was largely seasonal. Early [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic Culture]] influenced the [[Plano cultures|Plano Culture]] by about 8000 BC. The Plano peoples and other cultural groups stemming from the Archaic Culture were notable for their use of spear-throwing technology, which likely made them able to maintain larger populations and expand their access to different foods. By AD 1000, the indigenous Arctic inhabitants have also developed other tools that improved their [[standard of living]], such as [[fire]], which was set to the woodlands to be used to drive [[deer]] to be hunted.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn, Graeme. Canada and Arctic North America: An Environmental History. Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2007.  pgs. 25-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, English scientist [[William Scoresby]] explored the [[Arctic]] and wrote reports on its [[meteorology]], [[zoology]] and [[geophysics]]. Around this time, the Arctic region was becoming a major subject of imperial science. Though permanent observatories were not yet established, traveling scientists began to gather magnetic data in the Arctic in the early nineteenth century. In June 1831, [[James Clark Ross|Sir James Ross]] and a group of [[Eskimo]]s explored the Booth Peninsula in order to determine the exact location of the [[North Magnetic Pole|Magnetic North Pole]]. In the European Arctic, however, Scandinavian powers collected most of the scientific data as a result of early colonies established by Norsemen in Iceland and Greenland. Scientific expeditions to the Arctic started to happen more frequently by the middle of the nineteenth century. From 1338-1840, French La Recherche went on an expedition to the North Atlantic with a team of French, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish scientists. Between 1856 and 1914, the Swedes made about twenty-five expeditions to the Arctic island of [[Spitsbergen]] in [[Norway]]. As the Swedes expanded their influence in Spitsbergen, they used the area for economic as well as scientific motives through mining and resource extraction. During this time, the [[United States]], [[Russia]], [[Great Britain]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]], and [[Germany]] also started to become more active in Spitsbergen.&lt;ref&gt;Sörlin, Sverker(2006)'Science, Empire, and Enlightenment: Geographies of Northern Field Science', European Review of History: Revue europeenne d'histoire,13:3,455 — 472&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
In 1946, The Arctic Research Laboratory was established under the contract of the Office of Naval Research in Point Barrow, Alaska for the purpose of investigating the physical and biological phenomena unique to the Arctic. In 1948, Dr. Laurence Irving was appointed as the Scientific Director of the Arctic Research Laboratory and put in charge of coordinating various projects. Scientists performed fieldwork to collect data that linked new observations to prior widely accepted knowledge. Through the processes of soil sampling, surveying and photographing landscapes and distributing salmon tags, scientists demonstrated the significance of historical case studies in the study of environmental science. The ability to compare past and present data allowed scientists to understand the causes and effects of ecological changes. Around this time, geographers from McGill University were developing new methods of studying geography in the North. As laboratory research was beginning to trump field research, McGill geographers implemented use of aviation in research, helping knowledge production to occur in the laboratory instead of in the field. Aviation allowed researchers to remould the way they studied the Northern landscape and  indigenous people. Quick and easy travel using aircraft also promoted an integration of the Northern science with Southern community-based science, while changing the scale of ecology being studied. The ability to photograph, and observe the Arctic from an aircraft, provided researchers with a larger scope that allowed them to see a massive amount of space at one time, while also asserting objectivity. A photograph produces evidence, similar to laboratory data, yet it can be understood, circulated and accepted by the common people due to its aesthetic value.&lt;ref&gt;Bocking, Stephen. "A Disciplined Geography Aviation, Science, and the Cold War in Northern Canada, 1945-1960." Technology and Culture 50, no. 2 (2009): 265-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Cold War, the Canadian government began taking initiatives to secure the continent, and to assert territorial authority over northern Canada, including the Arctic, which at the time had a dominant American presence. The Canadian government demonstrated their desire for national dominance and security by requiring permission from other nations to utilize their land for military initiatives. They also supported and implemented civilian initiatives including resource development, wildlife conservation and the social and economic development of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Bocking, Stephen. "A Disciplined Geography Aviation, Science, and the Cold War in Northern Canada, 1945-1960." Technology and Culture 50, no. 2 (2009): 265-290.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950’s, ecologist Charles Elton was drawn to the Arctic to study the existence, causes and effects of cycles in animal populations, while ecologists Frank Banfield and John Kelsal studied the factors, especially human impacts, influencing hunting and game populations on animals such as caribou.&lt;ref&gt;Bocking, Stephen. “Science and Spaces in the Northern Environment.” Environmental History 12 (2007): 867-94. Accessed on February 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s and 1970s brought a decrease in the desire to protect the Arctic as it was seen to lack a significant amount of biodiversity. This allowed for scientists to extend further research in the area. In June 1960, the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) was constructed, headed by General Duncan Hallock and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The two predecessor organizations that made up the CRREL were the Arctic Construction and Frost Effects Laboratory (ACFEL), and the Snow, Ice and Permafrost Research Establishment (SIPRE). The goal of the CREEL laboratory was to bring together the ACFEL and SIPRE to expand the size and scientific reputation of these organizations, solve problems in cold regions and explore the basic environmental characteristics of cold regions.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Edmund. CRREL's First 25 Years 1961-1986. Arctic: Technical Publications Writer- Editor, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, study and management of the Arctic was taken over by consulting firms hired and controlled by the government.

===Indigenous peoples and research===
As research in the Arctic region of northern [[North America]] became more frequent, conflicts between researchers and the indigenous peoples started to occur. Recently, the indigenous communities of the North American Arctic have played a direct role in setting ethical standards for research in the region. Scientists have combined the use of laboratory research and field research in the [[Polar region|Polar Regions]] to gain a more comprehensive understanding of its characteristics. Because of scientific research in the north, living in and traveling to the Arctic has become much safer. However, the indigenous peoples viewed the effects of the research and development in the area differently than the scientists did. Since the 1960s, indigenous peoples have been more politically active and began pursuing the recognition of their rights regarding land-claims and self-government institutions. Indigenous communities voiced their concern that this research could lead to undesirable changes to the region’s landscape and economy. Canadian officials responded to their concerns by addressing the responsibility of scientists to consult with indigenous communities before conducting research. In 1977, the Association of Canadian Universities for Northern Studies (ACUNS) was founded at Churchill, Manitoba to improve scientific activity in the region. ACUNS published a document aimed at promoting cooperation between the northern indigenous people and researchers called ''Ethical Principles for the Conduct of Research in the North (1982)''. The document was published in English, French, and Inuktitut so it could be clearly understood among different groups. Relationships between science and society in the Arctic continue to change and adapt based on the politics of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Korsmo, Fae L. and Amanda Graham. "Research in the North American North: Action and Reaction." Arctic 55.4 (2002): 319-328. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human ecology in the Arctic==
Evidence has been found of early humans in the early Würm-Weichsel period hunting large Arctic mammals in the [[Ice Age]] steppes of northern Europe. However, it is still unclear whether these humans were just temporary migrants or inhabitants of Arctic colonies at the time.

[[File:Inupiat Family from Noatak, Alaska, 1929, Edward S. Curtis (restored).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Inuit peoples are among the indigenous inhabitants of the Arctic.|Inuit peoples are among the indigenous inhabitants of the Arctic.]]

The earliest inhabitants of the polar regions were the [[Neanderthals]], or ''Homo neanderthalensis'', who are considered to be an intermediate stage between ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]''. The Neandertalers made advances in the basic production of stone, bone antler and flint tools, which archaeologists call a [[Mousterian|Mousterian industry]]. About 40,000 years ago, the Neandertalers quickly disappeared and were replaced by modern humans, ''Homo sapiens sapiens''. Just a few thousand years after the sudden disappearance of the Neandertalers, modern humans occupied all the land that their predecessors had occupied. Some scientists believe that the Neandertalers were overcome by the incoming modern race, commonly called [[Cro-Magnon]] people, while others believe the race disappeared by integrating itself within the new population.

The [[Aurignacian|Aurignacoid]] (upper Paleolithic tool-making) tradition of the modern people is most associated with a feature called [[blade]]-and-core technology. According to Quaternary scientist C.V. Haynes, Arctic [[Cave painting|cave art]] also dates back to the Aurignacoid phase and climaxes during the end of the [[Pleistocene]], which encompasses subjects such as hunting and spirituality. People stemming from the [[Clovis culture]] populated northern regions of Canada and formed what led to the Northern Archaic and Maritime Archaic traditions at the end of the [[Late Glacial Maximum|Late Glacial]] period. Recently, small flint tools and artifacts from about 5,000 years ago were discovered that belonged to a culture now generally called the [[Arctic Small Tool tradition]]. The ASTt people are believed to be the physical and cultural ancestors of modern arctic [[Inuit]].&lt;ref&gt;*Young, Steven B. To the Arctic: An Introduction to the Far Northern World. New York: Wiley, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, as European trade interests among the Northwest Company and the Hudson's Bay Company expanded into northern Canada, arctic indigenous peoples began to become more involved in the trade process. Increasingly more European goods, including kettles, iron tools, tobacco, alcohol, and guns, were bought and traded by the indigenous peoples within their communities. European imports in exchange for more primitive, native resources and tools made life for the indigenous more efficient and comfortable. Native societies in the early eighteenth century also began to buy guns from European traders, and these guns made hunting easier. They were also occasionally used in native etiquette, medicinal, and religious practices. Because of the natives' increased hunting efficiency, scarcity of resources became an issue in the region, a version of what American human ecologist Garrett Hardin called "the tragedy of the commons."&lt;ref&gt;Wynn, Graeme. Canada and Arctic North America: An Environmental History. Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2007. pgs. 64-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arctic peoples value spiritual connections with their environment, which leads to a spiritual understanding along with their scientific understanding. Their lifestyles, therefore, reflect not only activity that is economically efficient but also that which is in line with their spiritual beliefs and values. The Alaskan Athabascan people, for example, spiritually value the [[moose]]. State law acknowledges this spiritual belief and allows people to take moose for [[potlatch]]es outside of the usual hunting season. The indigenous peoples of the Arctic drawn from scientific, emotional and spiritual sources of information, which often does not agree with non-indigenous scientific observations.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. Climate Change and Arctic Sustainable Development: scientific, social, cultural and  educational challenges. Paris: UNESCO, 2009. pgs. 73-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation and environmental issues==
Suspected worldwide anthropogenic climate change has been particularly evident in the Arctic. This is evident by warmer temperatures, melting glaciers, shorter durations of sea ice and changing weather and storm patterns. Scientists are especially concerned about four aspects of the continued projected warming of the Arctic.

First, [[thermohaline circulation]] is a series of underwater oceanic currents fueled by the salinity and temperature of seawater. Melting ice sheets would introduce vast amounts of fresh water into the North Atlantic, causing a change in density which could disrupt the currents. If this circulation slowed or stopped, the climates of northern Europe and North America would be strongly impacted.

Second, the melting of glaciers and sea ice is disrupting the lifestyles of a wide range of species. [[Polar bear]]s live on the sea ice for much of the year and find their food in the surrounding ocean waters. Recent projections suggest that global warming will lead to the disappearance of most summer sea ice within 40 years.

A third practical concern is the melting of permafrost due to climate change. Degradation of this permafrost is leading to major ground surface subsidence and pounding. The ground is literally melting away in many regions of the Arctic. The locations of towns and communities that have been inhabited for centuries are now in jeopardy. A condition known as drunken tree syndrome is being caused by this melting. Ground water and river runoffs are being negatively impacted as well. Although warming conditions might increase {{chem|CO|2}} uptake for photosynthetic organisms in some places, scientists are concerned that melting permafrost will also release large amounts of carbon locked in permafrost. Higher temperatures increase soil decomposition and if soil decomposition becomes higher than net primary production, global atmospheric carbon dioxide will in turn increase. Atmospheric sinks in the water table are also being reduced as the permafrost melts and decreases the height of the water table in the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter_C._Oechel|Oechel, Walter]] and George Vourlitis. “The Effects of Climate Charge on Land—Atmosphere Feedbacks in Arctic Tundra Regions.” Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 9 (1994): 324-329. Accessed on February 23, 2014. Doi: 10.1016/0169-5347(94)90152-X.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the impacts of the release of carbon from the permafrost could be amplified by high levels of [[deforestation]] in the Boreal forests in Eurasia and Canada. This biome currently serves as a large [[carbon sink]], [[Carbon sequestration|sequestering]] large amounts of carbon dioxide. However, over half of the original forest has been or in danger of harvesting, largely for export. Carbon Dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which facilitates increased warming of the earth.

==Further exploration==
In a [[meta analysis]] of the published work in aquatic ecosystems since the term [[biodiversity]] appeared in the bibliography, the Arctic and Antarctic Polar regions were found to be still unexplored. In addition, the North Pacific Ocean (Pacific Northeast and Pacific Northwest), still has few citations in comparison to its large size. This limits our perception of the world’s aquatic biodiversity. Consequently, we do not have sufficient information about biodiversity in most places on earth. Even though biodiversity declines from the equator to the poles in terrestrial ecosystems, this is still a hypothesis to be tested in aquatic and especially marine ecosystems where causes of this phenomenon are unclear. In addition, particularly in marine ecosystems, there are several well stated cases where diversity in higher latitudes actually increases (Moustakas &amp; Karakassis 2005). Therefore, the lack of information on biodiversity of Arctic Regions prevents scientific conclusions on the distribution of the world’s aquatic biodiversity.

It is located in the neighborhood of [[San Juan de Los Morros]].

From its highest point you can see the city in a panoramic view. It was declared a natural monument in 1949 are located in the northwest of Guárico, in the vicinity of San Juan de los Morros, capital of the Guárico state. Taking the regional highway of the center are to 2 hours of [[Caracas]]. It is about hills of reef limestone rocks that rise in a toothed form which had their evolution when an ancient sea covered this area 80 million years ago. It presents the formation of numerous caves of small size.

Its main attraction is the hills, geological formations that rise up to 1,060 meters, consisting of reef limestone dating 80 million years ago. There visitors often practice climbing, a sport for which there are several schools in the town of San Juan, who are responsible for making the transfers and training necessary for such activity.

==History==
Bangladesh Hydrocarbon Unit traces its origin to a project called Strengthening of the Hydrocarbon Unit in the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources on July 1999. The project was financed by the [[government of Norway]]. The Hydrocarbon unit signed an agreement with the [[Norwegian Petroleum Directorate]] of the [[Ministry of Petroleum and Energy]] for technical assistance. The project ended on December 2005. From April 2006 the government of Bangladesh started the second phrase of the project. The second phrase was financed by a Norwegian Government Grant and it was administered by the [[Asian Development Bank]].

The '''Bangladesh Power Development Board''' (BPDB) was created as a public sector organization to boost the country’s power sector after the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent state in 1972. The organization is responsible for planning and developing the nation's power infrastructure and for operating much of its power generation facilities.&lt;br&gt;
The BPDB is responsible for the major portion of generation and distribution of electricity mainly in urban areas of the country. The Board is now under the Power Division of the [[Ministries of Bangladesh|Bangladesh Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources]].&lt;ref name=Powercell  &gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.powercell.gov.bd/ |title= Bangladesh Powercell Organization| accessdate=12 Jul 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The predecessor of the BPDB was the [[Water and Power Development Authority]] (WAPDA) of Pakistan.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.bpdb.gov.bd/bpdb/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2 |title=History of BPDB |accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the [[Rural Electrification Board]] (REB) and the [[Dhaka Electric Supply Authority]] (DESA) now [[Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited]] (DESCO) were created.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Power_Development_Board|title=Power Development Board - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|access-date=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; PDB was dominated by trade unions and the consistent operation at loss concerned the government. In 2017 PDB was made a holding company by the government of Bangladesh. it is now the parent company of [[Ashuganj Power Station Company Ltd]], [[Coal Power Generation Company Bangladesh Limited]], [[Electricity Generation Company of Bangladesh]], [[Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited]], [[Dhaka Power Distribution Company Limited]], [[North West Power Generation Company Limited]], [[North West Zone Power Distribution Company Limited]], and [[West Zone Power Distribution Company Limited]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/power-energy/2017/03/26/pdb-become-holding-company-employees-move/|title=PDB to become holding company, employees against the move {{!}} Dhaka Tribune|website=www.dhakatribune.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
As of June 2010, in FY 2009–2010, BPDB had a total installed capacity of 5823 MW at 88 units (BPDB 3719 MW at 50 units and IPP, SIPP &amp; Rental at 38 units) in power plants located in different parts of the country.

The main fuel used for power generation in BPDB plants is indigenous natural gas. BPDP operations also include projects that utilize renewable power sources including offshore wind power generation.&lt;ref name=mywindpower &gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mywindpowersystem.com/2010/05/08/bangladesh-power-development-boardbpdb-announces-100200-mw-project/ |title=Offshore Wind Farm | accessdate=10 Jul 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 17,079 GWh gross energy was generated in the public sector power plants operated by BPDB in 2010. In addition, a total of 11,327 GWh of energy was purchased by BPDB from Independent Power Producers (IPP, SIPP &amp; Rental) in the private sector.

The maximum demand served during peak hours was 4698.5 MW on August 20, 2010. The transmission network is 8465 circuit kilometers long comprising 230, 132 and 66&amp;nbsp;kV lines. The total number of grid sub-stations is 108 and the total capacity is 16,749 MVA as of June 2010.

In FY 2010–11, BPDB had about 12,516 employees.

As of November 2013, Installed Generation capacity has increased to 10213 MW.

'''Brazilin''' is a red pigment obtained from the wood of the [[brazilwood]] family (''Caesalpinia sp''), and is also known as '''Natural Red 24'''. Brazilin has been used since at least the Middle Ages to [[natural dye|dye]] fabric, and has been used to make paints and inks as well. The specific color produced by the pigment depends on its manner of preparation: in an acidic solution brazilin will appear yellow, but in an alkaline preparation it will appear red. Brazilin is closely related to the blue-black dye precursor [[haematoxylin|hematoxylin]], having one fewer hydroxyl group. Brazilein is an oxidized form of brazilin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0924-2031(01)00138-2 | title = Vibrational spectroscopic study of brazilin and brazilein, the main constituents of brazilwood from Brazil | year = 2002 | last1 = De Oliveira | first1 = Luiz F.C. | last2 = Edwards | first2 = Howell G.M. | last3 = Velozo | first3 = Eudes S. | last4 = Nesbitt | first4 = M. | journal = Vibrational Spectroscopy | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of brazilin==
Many members of the genus ''Caesalpinia'' produce brazilin, including brazilwood (''C. echinata'') and [[sappanwood]] (''C. sappan''). The sappanwood is found in India, Malaysia, Indonesia and Sri Lanka, the latter being a major supplier of the wood to Europe during the early Middle Ages. Later, discovery of brazilwood in the new world led to its rise in popularity with the dye industry and eventually its [[over-exploitation]]. Brazilwood is now classified as an [[endangered species]].

==Extraction and preparation==
There are many ways to extract and prepare brazilin. A common recipe, developed in the Middle Ages, is to first powder the brazilwood, turning it into sawdust. Then, the powder can be soaked in [[lye]] (which produces a deep, purplish red) or a hot solution of [[alum]] (which produces an orange-red color), either of which extracts the color better than plain water alone. To the lye extract, alum is added (or to the alum extract, lye) in order to fix the color, which will precipitate from the solution. The precipitate can be dried and powdered, and is a type of [[lake pigment]].

Like many lake pigments, the exact colors produced depends on the pH of the mixture and the fixative used. Aluminum mordants used with brazilin produce the standard red colors, while the use of a tin mordant, in the form of SnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or SnCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; added to the extract is capable of yielding a pink color.

An alternative preparation which produces a transparent red color involves soaking the brazilwood powder in [[glair]] or a solution of [[gum arabic]]. Alum is added to help develop and fix the color, which can then be used as a transparent ink or paint.

As with [[haematein|hematein]], brazilin can be used for staining cell nuclei in histological preparations when combined with aluminum. The nuclei are then colored red instead of blue.

The depth of this lake is very less so when there is too much of rain then the lake overflows and the excess water channels through the Ghagra river to the [[Barak River|Barak river]] and eventually flows into Bangladesh. Chatla is famous for its fishery and it is one of the producers of fish for all the district in southern Assam. Chatla produces all types of fish and the specialty of Chatla is its Bhujia fish.

Chatla Wetland is located in the District Cachar of the state Assam. The residents of Chatla are mainly of Bengali, Chatla haor’ is a seasonal wetland where people are engaged in agriculture during dry period (October-March) while the wetland act as a fishery during wet period (April- September). Chatla is located near the second largest town of Assam, Silchar. The main language spoken here is Sylheti by the Bengali population.  Rice is the staple food and fish is also available.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5873">'''Cicada lore and mythology''' is rich and varied as there are [[circa|c.]] 2500 species of [[cicada]] throughout the world, many of which are undescribed and remain a mystery to science.  Cicada has been prized as a [[delicacy]], and&lt;ref&gt;Dalby (2003: p.86) states that:  "The cicada was a better-known food in Greece than in Rome.  The grubs or nymphs were nicer to eat than the mature insects, says [[Aristotle]].  Boiled cicada was recommended in the treatment of bladder disorders.  The cicada is Greek ''tettix'', Latin ''cicada''."&lt;/ref&gt; are famed throughout the world for their song. 

The cicada is an ancient [[wikt:polyvalent|polyvalent]] symbol:  resounding themes are resurrection, immortality, spiritual realization and spiritual ecstasy. For the ancient Greeks and Romans they sang in intoxicated [[Religious ecstasy|ecstasy]] and were sacred to [[Apollo]] and cognate with the [[:wikt:dionysiac|dionysiac]] [[bacchae]] and [[maenad]].

==Eunomos and his cithara==

Egan (1994) affirms that there are several independent Greek sources that tell the story of [[Eunomos]] and the cicada.  Eunomos, an accomplished [[cithara]]&lt;ref&gt;The cithara, as an instrument of professional musicians, is a [[:wikt:potent|potent]] attribute of Apollo.&lt;/ref&gt; player and singer, was performing in a competition when one of the cithara strings snaps.  A cicada as offering, [[:wikt:alights|alights]] on his cithara, sustaining the note of the broken string. Eunomos, thereby attributed [[:wikt:accolade|accolade]], wins the competition.

==Aristotle==

[[Aristotle]], fond of eating cicada, described them with decisive brevity in his investigatory ''[[Historia Animalium]]''.  From this, we know that he was aware of their periodic lifecycle, their emergent resurrection from the earth, their progression to their winged form and song.  Aristotle is attributed with seeding Grecian culture with cicada symbolism of resurrection and immortality; though it may be asserted that their [[Liminality|liminal]] quality and propensity to incite [[:wikt:awe|awe]] pre-date Aristotle.

==Phaedrus, Plato and Socrates==

In ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]]'', a [[dialogue]] authored by [[Plato]], a sagely [[Socrates]] and his student of [[rhetoric]] Phaedrus engage in thoughtful [[repartee]] in an earthy setting by a lush riverbank in the shade of a tree occupied by a [[Greek chorus|chorus]] of cicadas.&lt;ref&gt;Phaedrus is Plato's only dialogue where Socrates is conveyed in the country and outside of Athens.&lt;/ref&gt;

These cicada are not [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]]; they provide metaphorical richness, a [[:wikt:salient|salient]] musical [[Motif (music)|motif]] and liminal [[hierophany]] to the dialogue of Socrates and Phaedrus.

It is in ''Phaedrus'' that Socrates states that some of life's greatest blessings flow from mania&lt;ref&gt;Plato's Phaedrus, R. Hackforth, 1952, Cambridge U. Press&lt;/ref&gt; specifically in the four kinds of mania: (1) prophetic; (2) poetic; (3) cathartic; and (4) erotic.  It is in this context that Socrates' Myth of the Cicadas is presented.  The Cicadas chirp and watch to see whether their music lulls humans to laziness or whether the humans can resist their sweet song.  Cicadas were originally humans who, in ancient times, allowed the first Muses to enchant them into singing and dancing so long that they stopped eating and sleeping and actually died without noticing it.  The Muses rewarded them with the gift of never needing food or sleep, but to sing from birth to death.  The task of the Cicadas is to watch humans to report who honors the Muses and who does not.

In the dialogue, Socrates affirms that [[nymphs]] and local divinities or [[spirit|spirits of place]] inhabit the countryside; talks of the [[Muses]] and nature gods such as [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]; in addition he indulges in an extended [[exegesis]] of his own [[daemon (classical mythology)|dæmon]]; waxes lyrical, connecting divine inspiration to religion, poetry, art and love; all of which are informed and rendered in poignant relief by cicada chorus.

'''Cliffs of the Neuse State Park''' is a [[List of North Carolina state parks|North Carolina state park]] in [[Seven Springs, NC|Seven Springs]], [[Wayne County, North Carolina|Wayne County]], [[North Carolina]] in the [[United States]]. It is located near [[Seven Springs, North Carolina]] and covers {{convert|1094|acre|km2|1}}&lt;ref name=ParkSize /&gt; along the southern banks of the [[Neuse River]]. It has a swimming area, camp sites, hiking trails, fishing areas, and picnic areas. The park's [[museum]] features exhibits about the geology and natural history of the [[cliffs]] and the park. Extending for {{convert|600|yd}}, the series of cliffs rise {{convert|90|ft|m}} above the water. Layers of sand, [[clay]], [[seashells]], [[shale]] and [[gravel]] form the multicolored cliff face, a rainbow of white, tan, yellow and brown.

==History==

The cliffs were formed when a fault in the Earth's crust shifted millions of years ago. The [[Neuse River]] followed this fault line and, over time, cut its course through layers of sediment deposited by shallow seas that had earlier covered the coastal plain. A portion of the river took a bend against its bank and the water's erosive action slowly carved Cliffs of the Neuse.

Much of the human history of the area centers around the river. The [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]] and [[Saponi]] Indian tribes once occupied much of the land between the Neuse and Pamlico rivers. What is now the park used to be a ceremonial ground and a gathering place for hunting expeditions. The river was also used for travel into the surrounding wilderness.

In 1944, local landowner Lionel Weil, a founder of Goldsboro's historic [[Congregation Oheb Sholom (Goldsboro, North Carolina)|Oheb Shalom]] synagogue and uncle of [[Gertrude Weil]], proposed that the cliffs area along the [[Neuse River]] be preserved as a state park. The park was established in 1945 when land on the south side of the river was donated by Lionel Weil and other individuals through the Wayne Foundation. An additional contribution of approximately {{convert|200|acre|km2|1}} extended the boundary east of the river. Additional purchases and donations increased the park to its present size of {{convert|892|acre|km2|1}}.

== Plants and Animals ==
[[File:Tree Roots at Riverside.jpg|thumb|225px|left|Tree roots at riverside in park.]]
A range of habitats contributes to the variety of plants in the park. River margins, flood plains, rolling uplands and ravines are home to a large mixture of trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants. More than 420 species of plants have been recorded in the park.

[[Opossum]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[fox]]es, and [[eastern gray squirrel|squirrels]] are common in the campground and along hiking trails, while [[northern river otter|river otter]] and [[muskrat]] can be seen swimming along the waterways. Reptiles and amphibians are equally at home in the wetland and aquatic habitats. Most of the snakes are nonvenomous, although [[Agkistrodon piscivorus|copperheads]] are present. Small nocturnal rodents and [[white-tailed deer]] live in the area but are discreet and seldom seen. Sightings of [[American black bear|black bears]] and a [[coyote]] have taken place at the park.

Birds are abundant in the park during any season. The [[northern parula]] nests in clumps of [[Spanish moss]] while the [[prothonotary warbler]] lives along the river. Fall and winter bring a host of migratory waterfowl to the area to join the native [[wood duck]].

[[Image:ClootieWell01.PNG|thumb|Offerings at the clootie well near [[Munlochy]], on the [[Black Isle]], [[Easter Ross]]]]
'''Clootie wells''' (also '''Cloutie''' or '''Cloughtie wells''') are places of [[pilgrimage]] in [[Celtic areas]]. They are [[water well|wells]] or [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], almost always with a tree growing beside them, where strips of cloth or rags have been left, usually tied to the branches of the tree as part of a [[healing]] [[ritual]]. In [[Scots language|Scots]] nomenclature, a "[[clootie]]" or "cloot" is a strip of cloth or rag.

==Practices==
[[File:Approaching sancreed well cornwall.jpg|thumb|Clootie tree at [[Sancreed Well]], [[Cornwall]]]]
When used at the clootie wells in Scotland, Ireland, and the Isle of Man, the pieces of cloth are generally dipped in the water of the [[holy well]] and then tied to a branch while a [[prayer]] of [[supplication]] is said to the [[spirit]] of the well – in modern times usually a [[saint]], but in [[Celtic polytheism|pre-Christian]] times a [[goddess]] or local [[nature spirit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Water and Well-Worship in Man|first1=A. W.|last1=Moore|first2=John F.|last2=Terry|journal=Folklore|volume=5|issue=3|year=1894|pages=212-229}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is most often done by those seeking healing, though some may do it simply to honour the spirit of the well. In either case, many see this as a probable continuation of the ancient Celtic practice of leaving [[Votive deposit|votive offering]]s in wells or pits.&lt;ref name="Healy"&gt;Healy, Elizabeth (2002) ''In Search of Ireland's Holy Wells''. Dublin, Wolfhound Press {{ISBN|0-86327-865-5}} pp. 12–19, 27, 56–7, 66, 69, 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Logan"&gt;Logan, Patrick (1980) ''The Holy Wells of Ireland''. Buckinghamshire, Colin Smythe Limited. {{ISBN|0-86140-046-1}}. pp. 22–3, 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are local variations to the practice. At some wells the tradition is to wash the affected part of the body with the wet rag and then tie the washing-rag on the branch; as the rag disintegrates over time, the ailment is supposed to fade away as well. At some wells the clooties are definitely "rags" and discards, at others, brightly coloured strips of fine cloth. In some locations the ceremony may also include [[circumambulation]] (or circling) of the well a set number of times and making an offering of a coin, pin or stone. Additional votive offerings hung on the branches or deposited in the wells may include [[rosary|rosaries]], religious medals, [[cross]]es, [[religious icon]]s and other symbols of faith.&lt;ref name="Healy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Logan"/&gt;

At clootie wells where the operative principle is to shed the ailment, and the clootie is thought to represent the ailment, the "offerings" may be grotesque castoffs. Those that instead view the clootie as an offering to the spirit, saint or deity are more likely to tie an attractive, clean piece of cloth or ribbon.&lt;ref name="Healy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Logan"/&gt;

The sacred trees at clootie wells are usually [[Common hawthorn|hawthorn]] trees, though [[ash tree]]s are also common.&lt;ref name="Healy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Logan"/&gt;

The most popular times for pilgrimages to clootie wells, like other holy wells, are on the feast days of Saints, the Pattern or Patron day, or on the old [[Gaels|Gaelic]] festival days of [[Imbolc]] (1 February), [[Beltane]] (1 May), [[Lughnasadh]] (1 August), or [[Samhain]] (1 November).&lt;ref name="Logan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="times"&gt;Healy (2002) p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
[[Image:Clouties near madron well.jpg|thumb|width=200px|right|Cloths tied to a tree near Madron Well in Cornwall - though the holy well is actually about 100m back into the woodland from the path]]
In [[Scotland]], by the village of [[Munlochy]] on the A832, is a clootie well at an ancient spring dedicated to [[Saint Curetán]], where rags are still hung on the surrounding bushes and trees. Here the well was once thought to have had the power to cure sick children who were left there overnight. In the heart of Culloden woods near the battlefield is a walled clootie well also known as St Mary's well. This well was traditionally visited on the first Sunday in May up until the early seventies. However, this tradition is now in decline.  Craigie well at [[Avoch]] on the [[Black Isle]] has both offerings of coins and clooties. Rags, wool and human hair were also used as charms against sorcery, and as tokens of penance or fulfilment of a vow.&lt;ref name="Sharp"&gt;Sharp, Mick (1997) ''Holy Places of Celtic Britain''. London, Blandford. {{ISBN|1-85079-315-8}}. p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; A clootie well once existed at Kilallan near [[Kilmacolm]] in [[Renfrewshire]]. This holy well was dedicated to St Fillan and cloth was tied to overhanging shrub branches.
[[File:St Fillan's Holy Well and spring site, Kilallan, Renfrewshire.jpg|left|thumb|250px|St Fillan's Clootie Well, Kilallan.]]
In [[Cornwall]], at [[Madron]] Well ({{gbmappingsmall|SW446328}}) the practice is to tie the cloth and as it rots the ailment is believed to disappear.&lt;ref name="Straffon"&gt;Straffon, Cheryl (1998) ''Fentynyow Kernow – In Search of Cornwall's Holy Wells'' Penzance, Meyn Mamvro. {{ISBN|0-9518859-5-2}} pp. 40–42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rundall, Charlotte (Ed.) (1998) "The Magic of Cornwall" in ''Reader's Digest'' pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894 Madron Well was said to be the only Cornish well where rags were traditionally tied.&lt;ref&gt;Quiller-Couch, M &amp; L, "Ancient and Holy Wells of Cornwall, 1894, p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; Rags have only appeared at other Cornish wells such as Alsia Well ({{gbmappingsmall|SW393251}}) and Sancreed Well ({{gbmappingsmall|SW417293}}) in about the last 30 years.&lt;ref name="Straffon"/&gt; Christ's Well at Mentieth was described in 1618 "as all tapestried about with old rags".&lt;ref name="Sharp"/&gt;

In Ireland at [[Loughcrew]], [[Oldcastle, County Meath]] ({{coord|53.743299|-7.134040|format=dms|type:landmark|display=inline}}) there is a wishing tree, where visitors to the passage tombs tie ribbons to the branch of a hawthorn tree. Loughcrew is a site of considerable historical importance in Ireland. It is the site of megalithic burial grounds dating back to approximately 3500 and 3300 BC, situated near the summit of Sliabh na Caillí and on surrounding hills and valleys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geograph.ie/photo/2523382 |title=Wishing Tree on the path to Loughcrew:: OS grid N5877 :: Geograph Ireland – photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.ie |date= |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental concerns==
Someone has raised concerns over the use of non-biodegradable rags.

==Popular culture==
A fictional clootie well at [[Auchterarder]] and the one on Black Isle feature in [[Ian Rankin]]'s novel ''[[The Naming of the Dead]]''. Author [[Ian Rankin]] visited the Clootie Well at [[Munlochy]], on the [[Black Isle]] before writing the book.

'''Cook Forest State Park''' is a {{convert|8500|acre|0|adj=on}} [[List of Pennsylvania state parks|Pennsylvania state park]] in [[Farmington Township, Clarion County, Pennsylvania|Farmington Township]], [[Clarion County, Pennsylvania|Clarion County]], [[Barnett Township, Forest County, Pennsylvania|Barnett Township]], [[Forest County, Pennsylvania|Forest County]] and [[Barnett Township, Jefferson County, Pennsylvania|Barnett Township]], [[Jefferson County, Pennsylvania|Jefferson County]], [[Pennsylvania]] in the United States. The park is a heavily wooded area of rolling hills and mountains along the [[Clarion River]] in northwestern Pennsylvania. Cook Forest State Park is known for some of America's finest virgin [[Pinus strobus|white pine]] and [[Tsuga|hemlock]] timber stands and was once called the "Black Forest" due to the preponderance of evergreen tree coverage.

Cook Forest is now a [[National Natural Landmark]] and was rated one of America's top 50 state parks by ''National Geographic Traveler'' magazine.{{citation needed|date=December 2008}}  It was chosen by the [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]] (DCNR) and its Bureau of Parks as one of "25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks".&lt;ref name =mustsee&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/findapark/index.htm | title = Find a Park: 25 Must-see Parks | accessdate = May 26, 2015 | publisher = Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
When European-Americans reached this part of Pennsylvania it was inhabited by the [[Seneca Nation]] of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]]. They used this area as a [[hunting]] grounds; the land of Cook Forest was then purchased by the English. Seneca Rock is still named after the first inhabitants, and the Paramount Pictures' film "[[Unconquered]]" was shot here in 1946 by [[Cecil B. DeMille]] and starring [[Gary Cooper]] and [[Paulette Goddard]].

John Cook was the first permanent American settler. He arrived in 1826 to determine the feasibility of building an east-to-west canal along the Clarion River for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. John purchased {{convert|765|acre}} and settled here with his wife and 10 children in 1828.&lt;ref name="cfsp"/&gt;

At the mouth of Tom's Run, now adjacent to the park office, John built his one-story cabin and the first of many water-driven sawmills. He worked his mills, logged with oxen, rafted logs to Pittsburgh and also engaged in flatboat building through the years.&lt;ref name="cfsp"/&gt;

John's son Andrew bought {{convert|36|acre}} from his father, then gained the rest of his land when his father died in 1858. Andrew's industry expanded, and he built the original Cook Forest Inn for his woodsmen's living quarters. Anthony erected three sawmills, one flouring mill, one [[planing mill]], a boat scaffold, several dwellings and a store. Andrew also served as a judge and local bank president. About 1870, he built the Cook Homestead (now a bed and breakfast)at the intersection of Route 36 and River Road. Cook family descendants still inhabit many of the homes along River Road. After Andrew's death, the business was managed under A. Cook Sons Company.&lt;ref name="cfsp"/&gt;

==The Forest Cathedral of Cook Forest==

[[Major Israel McCreight]] of [[Du Bois, Pennsylvania]], was author and steward of Cook Forest State Park, the first Pennsylvania State Park acquired to preserve a natural landmark, and a founder of the Pennsylvania Conservation Association.&lt;ref&gt;“The idea of making this timberland a public park originated with [[Major Israel McCreight|McCreight]] of [[Du Bois, Pennsylvania]], who gave liberally of his time and money to interest others, and presented the cause to the State Legislature in 1911.”  See Forest County Genealogy, History of Cook Forest at http://www.pa-roots.com/forest/history/historyofcookforest.html and http://www.pa-roots.com/forest/history/historyofcookforest.html&lt;/ref&gt; Cook Forest is the most important tract of virgin timberland to be found in Pennsylvania, and is without rival for size East of the Rockies.  Once called the “Black Forest,” the area is famous for its towering white pines and hemlocks. The idea to make Cook Forest a public park originated on [[Major Israel McCreight|McCreight]]'s first visit to the “Forest Cathedral” near the [[Clarion River]] in northwest central Pennsylvania.  “It was a beautiful day, August 21, 1910, that the writer with a few others were invited to a weekend house party at the A.W. Cook home. Cook would comment, as he led the way into the silent ‘temple of the gods’, and then listen to the exclamations of astonishment that were sure to come from those who followed along the fern-bound path in this fairyland. Often there was heard no comment, for in this silent cathedral of the Almighty, it was unuttered.  Frequently it was observed that sturdy men could not restrain their tears, at the solemnity of their environment.  It was during this walk that A.W. Cook and the writer sat down on a log to talk about the future fate of the magnificent panorama they saw and felt all about them, The writer said to him: ‘Cook, no greater crime could be committed than to destroy this; it shall not be destroyed; it must be saved for humanity’s sake.”&lt;ref&gt;“Cook Forest Park Story” at p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Major Israel McCreight|McCreight]] was determined to save the forest and began a campaign to conserve the natural landmark. In 1910, [[Major Israel McCreight|McCreight]] and others formed the Pennsylvania Conservation Association&lt;ref&gt;The Pennsylvania Conservation Association was headed by A.B. Farquhar, the great farm machinery manufacturer, philanthropist and writer of York, J. Horace McFarland of Harrisburg, Bishop Darlington, the University of Pennsylvania’s Dean and other prominent Philadelphians.  Farquhar was President and McCreight Secretary-Treasurer. Cook Forest Park Story p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; and successfully lobbied the legislature to consider Cook Forest for state park purposes. For sixteen years a series of unsuccessful legislative bills were introduced for the state to acquire Cook Forest. In 1923, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20101121154150/http://cookforest.com/articles/cookforest-history.cfm Cook Forest Association] was formed for the purpose of acquiring the Cook Forest tract of virgin white pine and hemlock.&lt;ref&gt;McCreight, [http://collection1.libraries.psu.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/digitalbks2/id/9473/rec/1 “Cook Forest Park: Story of the Sixteen Year Battle to Save the Last Stand of Historic Penn's Woods: The when, the why and how of it” (1936)](hereinafter “Cook Forest Park Story”) at p.14.  McCreight’s Cook Forest Park Story is “a brief history compiled from the records by one of the many thousands comprising the great army of patriotic citizens who fought to preserve the giant pines for future generations to enjoy.”&lt;/ref&gt; Early pioneers with the Cook Forest Association were [[Major Israel McCreight]], Theo Wilson and John Nicholson. The Association, endorsed by national natural resource groups and [[Governor Gifford Pinchot]], raised $200,000.&lt;ref name="cfsp"/&gt; 
[[File:Height 'n' Width.jpg|thumb|Old growth forest in the park]]

On April 14, 1927, a bill was signed by [[John Stuchell Fisher|Governor John Stuchell Fisher]] appropriating $450,000 on condition that the [https://web.archive.org/web/20101121154150/http://cookforest.com/articles/cookforest-history.cfm Cook Forest Association] raise the remaining $200,000 to purchase the 6,055 acres. On December 28, 1928, the funds having been raised by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20101121154150/http://cookforest.com/articles/cookforest-history.cfm Cook Forest Association], the Secretary of the Department of Forests and Waters announced the formal purchase.

Money from the Association helped the Commonwealth purchase {{convert|6055|acre}} from A. Cook Sons Company in 1927 for $640,000. Cook Forest became the first Pennsylvania State Park acquired to preserve a natural landmark.&lt;ref name="cfsp"/&gt;

Built in 1929, a [[firetower]] was used to spot forest fires. It stands over {{convert|80|ft}} tall. While no longer in use, the public can still climb to the top of the stairs. In addition, on rare occasions, the top spotting area will be opened by a guide to allow visitors a closer look.&lt;ref name="cfsp"&gt;{{cite web

The '''Cook Forest State Park Indian Cabin District''' is a national [[Historic district (United States)|historic district]] that includes 11 contributing buildings. They are single room [[log cabin]]s located on Toms Run behind the park office.  They were built by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] as part of Camp SP-2, which operated in the park from October 1933 to September 1935.&lt;ref name="arch"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce/SelectWelcome.asp| title = National Historic Landmarks &amp; National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania| publisher = CRGIS: Cultural Resources Geographic Information System| format = Searchable database}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web| url = {{NRHP-PA|H088883_01D.pdf}}| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Cook Forest State Park Indian Cabin District| accessdate = 2012-01-16| author =John Milner Associates| format = PDF| date= October 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These cabins are constructed largely of [[American chestnut]] logs which were selected due to both their long-term rot-resistance and the impending local extinction of the species due to [[chestnut blight]].

==Ecology==
{{see also|List of old growth forests}}

The park is in the  [[Allegheny Highlands forests]] [[ecoregion]]. It is famous for its spectacular stands of [[Old-growth forest|old-growth]] [[Eastern White Pine]] and [[Eastern Hemlock]], with more white pine over {{convert|150|ft|m}} in its Forest Cathedral than in any other site in the northeastern United States.  Many of these ancient trees began growing after a drought and fire in 1644.&lt;ref name="OldGrowthEastPA"&gt;{{Cite web

==Recreation==
Cook Forest features 27 marked trails totaling some {{convert|29|mi}} for hiking. The terrain is of rolling hills and cool valley streams. Special scenic areas are the old growth forest, Fire Tower/Seneca Point and the Clarion River. Among Cook Forest's primary attractions is the "Forest Cathedral" area of old growth white pine and hemlock, some trees of which top {{convert|180|ft}}. A somewhat more minor attraction is the short rock "grotto" found in the midst of the mountain-laurel thickets along Seneca trail roughly halfway between the Fire Tower/Seneca Point area and the end of Deer Park Trail. Part of the [[Baker Trail]] ({{convert|140|mi}}) and the [[North Country National Scenic Trail]] pass through Cook Forest. The Baker Trail runs from Freeport, in southern Armstrong County, to the Allegheny National Forest. The North Country Trail is under development and will connect the [[Missouri River]] in [[North Dakota]] with the [[Adirondack Mountains]] in [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="cfsp"/&gt;

[[Bikes]] are permitted on all one-way dirt roads within the park. Biking on hiking trails is not permitted except on the part of the Heffern Run Trail that is part of the Bicycle Route. All children under 12 years of age are required to wear a helmet when biking. Bikes ridden at night must have a light on the bike. The Bicycle Route is {{convert|11.5|mi}} long and follows lightly traveled roads within the park and Heffern Run Trail. The route is of moderate difficulty with long flat areas and rolling hills. Highlights of the route are a leisurely four-mile flat ride through scenic [[Tom's Run]] Valley, CCC-era red and white pine plantations along Forest Drive and a challenging descent along the Heffern Run Trail. A description of the Bicycle Route is available at the park office.&lt;ref name="cfsp"/&gt;

The swimming pool is permanently closed due to lack of funds to sustain it. Visitors may swim in the Clarion River across from the ranger station or anywhere along public park land. Many local businesses provide canoeing and tubing along the relatively shallow and slow-moving river.&lt;ref name="cfsp"/&gt;

Two designated bridle trails off Cemetery Road and portions of Brown's Run Trail comprise {{convert|4.5|mi}} of trails for horseback riding. Several stables dot the area and are open to the public most of the year; these include Silver Stallion, Pine Crest, and the Cook Forest Scenic Trailride, Dude Ranch, and Campground.&lt;ref name="cfsp"/&gt;

About {{convert|5000|acre}} are open to [[hunting]], [[Trapping (Animal)|trapping]], and the training of dogs during established seasons. Common game species are [[deer]], [[wild turkey]], [[bear]], and [[squirrel]]. Hunting [[groundhog|woodchucks]], also known as [[groundhog]]s, is prohibited. Dog training is only permitted from the day following [[Labor Day]] to March 31 in designated hunting areas. The Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and the [[Pennsylvania Game Commission]] rules and regulations apply. Contact the park office for accessible hunting information.&lt;ref name="cfsp"/&gt;

The [[Clarion River]] flows along the park border and provides fishing for [[trout]], warm-water game fish 
and [[panfish]]. Many visitors enjoy canoeing or kayaking down the river. There are also businesses that will rent you a canoe. About {{convert|2.5|mi}} of Tom's Run is stocked with trout. A special fishing pond [[fish stocking|stocked]] with trout is by the park office and is available for use by children 12 and younger and people with a disability. A level grass bank at the edge of the pond provides easy access. For complete information on fishing rules and regulations in Pennsylvania, visit the [[Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission]].&lt;ref name="cfsp"/&gt;

==Education==
Programs for all ages are offered March to December. Through hands-on activities, guided walks and evening programs, participants gain appreciation, understanding and develop a sense of stewardship toward natural and cultural resources.&lt;ref name="cfsp"/&gt;

Curriculum-based [[environmental education]] programs are available to schools and youth groups. Teacher workshops are available. Group programs must be scheduled in advance by calling the park office.&lt;ref name="cfsp"/&gt;

A weekly interpretive schedule is available at the park office. The park has an environmental learning center in the Log Cabin Inn at the Main Picnic Area. The Historical Room displays [[logging]] and [[rafting]] tools, models and artifacts.&lt;ref name="cfsp"/&gt;

The fire tower is always open for climbing during daylight hours, and the booth at its top is occasionally opened by a ranger for exhibition; check at the park office for a schedule.&lt;ref name="cfsp"/&gt;

[[Image:red-eyed-vireo-cook-forest-pa.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A [[Red-eyed vireo]] in its nest at Cook Forest State Park]]

A local, [[non-profit]] craft organization housed in the historic [[sawmill]] offers traditional [[crafts]] on display, a gift shop and classes. Demonstrations and classes on various crafts are presented throughout the summer and fall seasons for children and adults. The Verna Leith Sawmill Theater seats 180 people and presents [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[musicals]] and other entertainment throughout the summer season.&lt;ref name="cfsp"/&gt;

==Accommodations==
The 24 rustic cabins rent from the second Friday in April to late December. All cabins are minimally furnished. Each cabin has beds, mattresses, gas stove, refrigerator, and tables and chairs. Occupants must provide their own bedding, cookware and tableware. Alcoholic beverages and pets are not permitted. There are two cabin areas at Cook Forest. The River Cabins are on a hillside overlooking the Clarion River. Two River Cabins have one room and sleep four people and the other 11 River Cabins have four rooms, a fireplace and sleep six or eight people. The Indian Cabins are along Tom's Run behind the park office. These smaller, one-room cabins sleep four people.&lt;ref name="cfsp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cfspccc"&gt;{{cite web

'''Dipole anisotropy''' is a form of [[anisotropy]] and the progressive difference in the [[frequency]] of [[radiation]] from opposite directions due to the motion of the observer relative to the source. As a result of that motion, one end of the 360-degree spectrum is [[doppler effect|redshifted]], whereas the other end is [[doppler effect|blueshifted]]. That effect is notable in measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], due to the motion of [[earth]].

The '''ecosystem approach''' is a [[conceptual framework]] for resolving [[ecosystem]] issues. The idea is to protect and manage the environment through the use of [[scientific reasoning]].&lt;ref name=approach&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiversitya-z.org/content/ecosystem-approach|title=Biodiversity-Ecosystem Approach|publisher=biodiversitya-z.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another point of the ecosystem approach is preserving the Earth and its inhabitants from potential harm or permanent damage to the planet itself. With the preservation and management of the planet through an ecosystem approach, the future monetary and planetary gain are the by-product of sustaining and/or increasing the capacity of that particular environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/biodiversity/cross-sectoral-issues/ecosystem-approach/en/ Ecosystem Approach]&lt;/ref&gt; This is possible as the ecosystem approach incorporates humans, the economy, and ecology to the solution of any given problem. The initial idea for an ecosystem approach would come to light during the second meeting (November 1995) at [[Conference of the parties|the Conference of the Parties]] (COP) it was the central topic in implementation and framework for the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD), it would further elaborate on the ecosystem approach as using varies methodologies for solving complex issues.&lt;ref name=cbdgl&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbd.int/doc/publications/ea-text-en.pdf|title=CBD Guidelines|publisher=[[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout, the use and incorporation of ecosystem approaches, two similar terms have been created in that time: [[ecosystem-based management]] and [[ecosystem management]].&lt;ref name=approach/&gt; The Convention on Biological Diversity has seen ecosystem-based management as a supporting topic/concept for the ecosystem approach. Similarly, ecosystem management has a minor difference with the two terms. Conceptual the differences between the three terms come from a framework structure and the different methods used in solving complex issues.&lt;ref name=approach/&gt; The key component and definition between the three terms refer to the concept of conservation and protection of the ecosystem.&lt;ref name=approach/&gt;

The use of the ecosystem approach has been incorporated with managing water, land, and living organisms ecosystems and advocating the nourishment and sustainment of those ecological space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbd.int/ecosystem/|title=Ecosystem|publisher=CBD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ecosystem approach is a conceptual model for solving problems, the key idea could combat various problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=6276 JNCC-Ecosystem Approach]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On December 29, 1993, the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) was signed and applied as a multilateral treaty. With the purpose of achieving: 
#[[Biodiversity]]
#Sustainability of [[species diversity]]
#Endorse [[genetic diversity]] (e.g. to maintain and endorses livestock, crops, and wildlife)

Two years after the CBD was signed, during the second meeting of [[Conference of the parties|the Conference of the Parties]] (November 1995) the representatives of the signed treaty would agree upon employing a strategy to combat the intricate and actively changing ecosystem.&lt;ref name=cbdgl/&gt; The ecosystem approach would represent as the equalizer  for obtaining knowledge and creating countermeasures in preventing the endangerment of any ecological environment.
 
With the acknowledgment of the ecosystem approach, during the fifth meeting of the Conference of the Parties, a group consensus agreed on a concrete definition and elaboration for the ecosystem approach would be needed, and the Parties would request Subsidiary Body on Scientific Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) to create a guideline with 12 principles and a description of the ecosystem approach.&lt;ref name=cbdgl/&gt; The final results are given at [https://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/default.shtml?id=7148 COP 5 Decision V/6 summary].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/default.shtml?id=7148 COP 5 Decision V/6 summary]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the seventh meeting of the Conference of the Parties, further iteration on the ecosystem approach would be seen as a priority, during the meeting the parties would agree new implementation and strategical development could be incorporated with the ecosystem approach into the CBD.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/default.shtml?id=7748 COP 7 Decision Vll/11 summary]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, creating a new relationship with sustaining forest organization and the ecosystem approach was talked about. All topics and discussion regarding seventh meeting are given at [https://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/default.shtml?id=7748 COP 7 Decision Vll/11 summary].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/default.shtml?id=7748 COP 7 Decision Vll/11 summary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecosystem approach and management==
{{further information|Ecosystem-based management|Ecosystem management}}
With the development and use of the ecosystem approach, different variation to that form have been created and used. The two being ecosystem management and ecosystem-based management, the framework of the three methods are still the same (the conservation and protection of the ecosystem). The distinguishing part beings with how to initiate the approach of solving the problem. Ecosystem-based management (EBM) is used for projects that incorporate interaction of different levels: organisms, the ecosystem, and the human component; however, its varies from the other methods as the scale of the problem is larger and intricate. The objectives should be straightforward and condensed with important systematic information. Also, EBM considers social and cultural aspects into the solution not just only scientific reasoning. With ecosystem management, the process is similar to EBM; however, factors such as socioeconomics and politics can impact the decision and solution. A cultural aspect is also considered when creating a solution.

==Ecosystem approach to fisheries==
{{further information|Fishery|Ecosystem-based fisheries}}
The ecosystem approach is currently being used in the fields of environmental and ocean management (i.e. the ecosystem approach does not stop there; it is being used in various fields and sub-fields as well). The goal is to address the current problems facing those fields through the use of conceptual thinking and approach that would determine a viable and sustaining solution. One example, in particular, would be pertaining to [[Fishery]] (a commercial industry in capturing and selling of fishes). In recent years, inland fisheries have quintupled from 2 million metric tons to 11 million metric tons in the span of 60 years from 1950 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Stoica, Maricica. "[http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;u=colu91149&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA305194233&amp;asid=0db1d19612bbda6b3a6f9ee5501cc415 The ecosystem approach to ecological restoration management case study - Trotus hydrographic basin]." Management Research and Practice, vol. 4, no. 3, 2012, p. 57+. Academic OneFile. Accessed 8 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of the ecosystem approach more specifically the [[Fisheries management#Ecosystem based fisheries|ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF)]], sometimes referred to as Ecosystem-based fisheries.  EAF is seen as a framework to creating local strategies for each specific fishery ecosystem and implementing the new strategies gradually with the already existing rules and regulation. With the use of EAF if successful fishery industries could generate substantial income; as well as, improve the fragile ecosystem of aquarium species.

'''Fuel efficiency''' is a form of [[thermal efficiency]], meaning the ratio from effort to result of a process that converts [[chemical energy|chemical]] [[potential energy]] contained in a carrier ([[fuel]]) into [[kinetic energy]] or [[Mechanical work|work]]. Overall fuel efficiency may vary per device, which in turn may vary per application fuel efficiency, especially [[fossil fuel power plant]]s or industries dealing with [[combustion]], such as [[ammonia]] production during the [[Haber process]].

In the context of [[transport]], fuel economy is the [[energy efficiency in transportation|energy efficiency]] of a particular vehicle,  given as a [[ratio]] of distance traveled per unit of [[Motor fuel|fuel]] consumed. It is dependent on [[engine efficiency]], [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] design, and [[tire]] design. Fuel economy is expressed in [[mile]]s per [[gallon]] (mpg) in the USA and usually also in the UK ([[Imperial units|imperial]] gallon); there is sometimes confusion as the imperial gallon is 20% larger than the US gallon so that mpg values are not directly comparable. In countries using the [[metric system]] fuel economy is stated as "fuel consumption" in [[liter]]s per 100 [[kilometers]] (L/100&amp;nbsp;km). Litres per [[Scandinavian mile|mil]] are used in [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]].

Fuel consumption is a more accurate measure of a vehicle’s performance because it is a linear relationship while fuel economy leads to distortions in efficiency improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/label/learn-more-gasoline-label.shtml#fuel-consumption-rate |title= Learn More About the Fuel Economy Label for Gasoline Vehicles |publisher=  |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130705143242/http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/label/learn-more-gasoline-label.shtml#fuel-consumption-rate |archivedate= 2013-07-05 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weight-specific efficiency (efficiency per unit weight) may be stated for [[freight]], and passenger-specific efficiency (vehicle efficiency per passenger).

==Vehicle design 1HZ Engine==
Fuel efficiency is dependent on many parameters of a vehicle, including its [[engine]] parameters, [[Drag (physics)|aerodynamic drag]], weight, AC usage, fuel and [[rolling resistance]]. There have been advances in all areas of vehicle design in recent decades. Fuel efficiency of vehicles can also be improved by careful maintenance and driving habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.carsangrah.com/blog/simple-tips-tricks-enhance-fuel-efficiency-car|title=Simple tips and tricks to increase fuel efficiency of your car {{!}} CarSangrah|date=2018-06-07|work=CarSangrah|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hybrid vehicles]] use two or more power sources for propulsion. In many designs, a small combustion engine is combined with electric motors.  Kinetic energy which would otherwise be lost to heat during braking is recaptured as electrical power to improve fuel efficiency. Engines automatically shut off when vehicles come to a stop and start again when the accelerator is pressed preventing wasted energy from idling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Hybrid Work|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Energy]]|accessdate=2014-01-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708093450/http://www.fueleconomy.gov/|archivedate=2015-07-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fleet efficiency==
Fleet efficiency describes the average efficiency of a population of vehicles.  Technological advances in efficiency may be offset by a change in buying habits with a propensity to heavier vehicles, which are less efficient, all else being equal.

==Energy efficiency terminology==
[[Energy efficiency (physics)|Energy efficiency]] is similar to fuel efficiency but the input is usually in units of energy such as [[British thermal units]] (BTU), [[megajoules]] (MJ), gigajoules (GJ), kilocalories (kcal), or [[kilowatt-hours]] (kW·h).  The inverse of "energy efficiency" is "energy intensity", or the amount of input energy required for a unit of output such as MJ/passenger-km (of passenger transport), BTU/ton-mile or kJ/t-km (of freight transport), GJ/t (for production of steel and other materials), BTU/(kW·h) (for electricity generation), or litres/100&amp;nbsp;km (of vehicle travel). Litres per 100&amp;nbsp;km is also a measure of "energy intensity" where the input is measured by the amount of fuel and the output is measured by the [[distance]] travelled.  For example: [[Fuel economy in automobiles]].

Given a heat value of a fuel, it would be trivial to convert from fuel units (such as litres of gasoline) to energy units (such as MJ) and conversely. But there are two problems with comparisons made using energy units:
* There are two different heat values for any hydrogen-containing fuel which can differ by several percent (see below).
* When comparing transportation energy costs, it must be remembered that a [[kilowatt hour]] of electric energy may require an amount of fuel with heating value of 2 or 3 kilowatt hours to produce it.

==Energy content of fuel==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}

The specific energy content of a fuel is the heat energy obtained when a certain quantity is burned (such as a gallon, litre, kilogram).  It is sometimes called the [[heat of combustion]].  There exists two different values of specific heat energy for the same batch of fuel.  One is the high (or gross) heat of combustion and the other is the low (or net) heat of combustion.  The high value is obtained when, after the combustion, the water in the exhaust is in liquid form.  For the low value, the exhaust has all the water in vapor form (steam).  Since water vapor gives up heat energy when it changes from vapor to liquid, the liquid water value is larger since it includes the latent heat of vaporization of water.  The difference between the high and low values is significant, about 8 or 9%.  This accounts for most of the apparent discrepancy in the heat value of gasoline. In the U.S. (and the table) the high heat values have traditionally been used, but in many other countries, the low heat values are commonly used.

&lt;!--This table originally contained MJ/L values that were too low compared to the BTU/gal figures, with a reference to an ''Automotive Handbook''.&lt;ref&gt;''Automotive Handbook, 4th Edition'', Robert Bosch GmbH, 1996. ISBN 0-8376-0333-1&lt;/ref&gt; These have now been replaced with values from the ''Transportation Energy Data Book'',&lt;ref name=TEDB&gt;[http://www-cta.ornl.gov/data/Appendix_B.html Appendix B, Transportation Energy Data Book] from the [[Center for Transportation Analysis]] of the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]&lt;/ref&gt;
but which does not give the MJ/kg or the densities.)

Note: I modified this table because the values in SI units did not agree with the values in British or U.S. units. So I used another source, but it did not have MJ/kg, and I did not have the time to try to find accurate densities in order to convert to MJ/kg. If someone can fill in the blanks using good data, it would be useful.--&gt;

Neither the gross heat of combustion nor the net heat of combustion gives the theoretical amount of mechanical energy (work) that can be obtained from the reaction. (This is given by the change in [[Gibbs free energy]], and is around 45.7&amp;nbsp;MJ/kg for gasoline.) The actual amount of mechanical work obtained from fuel (the inverse of the [[Brake specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]]) depends on the engine. A figure of 17.6&amp;nbsp;MJ/kg is possible with a gasoline engine, and 19.1&amp;nbsp;MJ/kg for a diesel engine. See [[Brake specific fuel consumption]] for more information.

== Fuel efficiency of motor vehicles ==
{{See also|Fuel economy in automobiles}}
The fuel efficiency of motor vehicles can be expressed in more ways:
* '''Fuel consumption''' is the amount of fuel used per unit distance; for example, '''[[litre]]s per 100 [[kilometre]]s (L/100&amp;nbsp;km)'''. In this case, the '''lower''' the value, the more economic a vehicle is (the less fuel it needs to travel a certain distance); this is the measure generally used across Europe (except the UK, Denmark and The Netherlands - see below), New Zealand, Australia and Canada. Also in Uruguay, Paraguay, Guatemala, Colombia, China, and Madagascar.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, as also in post-Soviet space.
* '''Fuel economy''' is the distance travelled per unit volume of fuel used; for example, '''kilometres per litre (km/L)''' or '''[[mile]]s per [[gallon]] (MPG)''', where 1 MPG (imperial) ≈ 0.354006&amp;nbsp;km/L.  In this case, the '''higher''' the value, the more economic a vehicle is (the more distance it can travel with a certain volume of fuel). This measure is popular in the USA and the UK (mpg), but in Europe, India, Japan, South Korea and Latin America the metric unit ''km/L'' is used instead.

Converting from mpg or to L/100&amp;nbsp;km (or vice versa) involves the use of the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] function, which is not [[distributive property|distributive]]. Therefore, the average of two fuel economy numbers gives different values if those units are used, because one of the functions is reciprocal, thus not linear. If two people calculate the fuel economy average of two groups of cars with different units, the group with better fuel economy may be one or the other. However, from the point of energy used as a shared method of measure, the result shall be the same in both the cases.

The formula for converting to miles per US gallon (exactly 3.785411784 L) from L/100&amp;nbsp;km is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{235.215}{x}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is value of L/100&amp;nbsp;km. For miles per Imperial gallon (exactly 4.54609 L) the formula is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{282.481}{x}&lt;/math&gt;.

In parts of Europe, the two standard measuring cycles for "litre/100 km" value are "urban" traffic with speeds up to 50&amp;nbsp;km/h from a cold start, and then "extra urban" travel at various speeds up to 120&amp;nbsp;km/h which follows the urban test. A combined figure is also quoted showing the total fuel consumed in divided by the total distance traveled in both tests. A reasonably modern European [[supermini car|supermini]] and many mid-size cars, including station wagons, may manage [[motorway]] travel at 5 L/100&amp;nbsp;km (47 mpg US/56 mpg imp) or 6.5 L/100&amp;nbsp;km in city traffic (36 mpg US/43 mpg imp), with [[carbon dioxide]] emissions of around 140 g/km.

An average [[North America]]n [[mid-size car]] travels 21 mpg (US) (11 L/100&amp;nbsp;km) city, 27 mpg (US) (9 L/100&amp;nbsp;km) highway; a [[full-size car|full-size]] [[SUV]] usually travels 13 mpg (US) (18 L/100&amp;nbsp;km) city and 16 mpg (US) (15 L/100&amp;nbsp;km) highway.  [[Pickup truck]]s vary considerably; whereas a 4 cylinder-engined light pickup can achieve 28 mpg (8 L/100&amp;nbsp;km), a [[V8 engine|V8]] full-size pickup with extended cabin only travels 13 mpg (US) (18 L/100&amp;nbsp;km) city and 15 mpg (US) (15 L/100&amp;nbsp;km) highway.

The average fuel economy is higher in Europe due to the higher cost of fuel. In the UK, a gallon of gas without tax would cost US$1.97, but with taxes cost US$6.06 in 2005. The average cost in the United States was US$2.61. Consumers prefer "muscle cars" but choose more fuel efficient ones when gas prices increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0826/p01s03-woeu.html|title=Gas prices too high? Try Europe.|date=26 August 2005|publisher=|via=Christian Science Monitor|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918025725/http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0826/p01s03-woeu.html|archivedate=18 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European-built cars are generally more fuel-efficient than US vehicles. While Europe has many higher efficiency diesel cars, European gasoline vehicles are on average also more efficient than gasoline-powered vehicles in the USA. Most European vehicles cited in the CSI study run on diesel engines, which tend to achieve greater fuel efficiency than gas engines. Selling those cars in the United States is difficult because of emission standards, notes Walter McManus, a fuel economy expert at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. "For the most part, European diesels don’t meet U.S. emission standards", McManus said in 2007. Another reason why many European models are not marketed in the United States is that labor unions object to having the big 3 import any new foreign built models regardless of fuel economy while laying off workers at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17344368/|title=U.S. ‘stuck in reverse’ on fuel economy|date=28 February 2007|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511172008/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17344368/|archivedate=11 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of European cars' capabilities of fuel economy is the [[microcar]] ''[[Smart Fortwo]]'' cdi, which can achieve up to 3.4 l/100&amp;nbsp;km (69.2 mpg US) using a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] three-cylinder 41&amp;nbsp;bhp (30&amp;nbsp;kW) Diesel engine. The Fortwo is produced by [[Daimler AG]] and is currently only sold by one company in the United States. Furthermore, the current (and to date already 10-year-old) world record in fuel economy of production cars is held by the [[Volkswagen Group]], with special production models (labeled "3L") of the [[Volkswagen Lupo#Lupo 3L|Volkswagen Lupo]] and the [[Audi A2#1.2 TDI "3L"|Audi A2]], consuming as little as {{convert|3|L/100 km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/consumer/autos/mareview/mauto497.htm|title=VW Lupo: Rough road to fuel economy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diesel engine]]s generally achieve greater fuel efficiency than petrol (gasoline) engines. Passenger car diesel engines have [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] of up to 41% but more typically 30%, and petrol engines of up to 37.3%, but more typically 20%. That is one of the reasons why diesels have better fuel efficiency than equivalent petrol cars. A common margin is 25% more miles per gallon for an efficient turbodiesel.

For example, the current model Skoda Octavia, using Volkswagen engines, has a combined European fuel efficiency of 41.3 mpg for the {{convert|105|bhp|abbr=on}} petrol engine and 52.3 mpg for the {{convert|105|bhp|abbr=on}} — and heavier — diesel engine. The higher compression ratio is helpful in raising the energy efficiency, but diesel fuel also contains approximately 10% more energy per unit volume than gasoline which contributes to the reduced fuel consumption for a given power output.

In 2002, the United States had 85,174,776 trucks, and averaged {{convert|13.5|mpgus}}. Large trucks, over {{convert|33,000|lb}}, averaged {{convert|5.7|mpgus}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cta.ornl.gov/data/chapter5.shtml Heavy Vehicles and Characteristics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723162849/http://cta.ornl.gov/data/chapter5.shtml |date=2012-07-23 }} Table 5.4&lt;/ref&gt;

The average economy of automobiles in the United States in 2002 was {{convert|22.0|mpgus}}. By 2010 this had increased to {{convert|23.0|mpgus}}.

==Fuel efficiency in microgravity==

How fuel combusts affects how much energy is produced. The [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) has investigated fuel consumption in [[microgravity]].

The common distribution of a flame under normal gravity conditions depends on [[convection]], because soot tends to rise to the top of a flame, such as in a candle, making the flame yellow. In microgravity or [[zero gravity]], such as an environment in [[outer space]], convection no longer occurs, and the flame becomes [[sphere|spherical]], with a tendency to become more blue and more efficient. There are several possible explanations for this difference, of which the most likely one given is the hypothesis that the temperature is evenly distributed enough that soot is not formed and complete combustion occurs., National Aeronautics and Space Administration, April 2005. Experiments by NASA in microgravity reveal that [[diffusion flame]]s in microgravity allow more soot to be completely oxidised after they are produced than diffusion flames on Earth, because of a series of mechanisms that behaved differently in microgravity when compared to normal gravity conditions.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070312020123/http://microgravity.grc.nasa.gov/combustion/lsp/lsp1_results.htm LSP-1 experiment results], National Aeronautics and Space Administration, April 2005. [[Premixed flame]]s in microgravity burn at a much slower rate and more efficiently than even a candle on Earth, and last much longer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://microgravity.grc.nasa.gov/combustion/lsp/lsp1_results.htm SOFBAL-2 experiment results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312020123/http://microgravity.grc.nasa.gov/combustion/lsp/lsp1_results.htm |date=2007-03-12 }}, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transportation ==

===Fuel efficiency in transportation===
{{Main|Energy efficiency in transportation}}

=== Vehicle efficiency and transportation pollution ===
{{Main|Gas-guzzler|Vehicle Efficiency Initiative}}

Fuel efficiency directly affects emissions causing pollution by affecting the amount of fuel used. However, it also depends on the fuel source used to drive the vehicle concerned. Cars for example, can run on a number of fuel types other than gasoline, such as [[Natural gas vehicle|natural gas]], [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] or [[biofuel]] or electricity which creates various quantities of atmospheric pollution.

A kilogram of carbon, whether contained in petrol, diesel, kerosene, or any other hydrocarbon fuel in a vehicle, leads to approximately 3.6&amp;nbsp;kg of [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions.&lt;ref name="EPA CO2 est"&gt;{{cite web | title = Emission Facts: Average Carbon Dioxide Emissions Resulting from Gasoline and Diesel Fuel | url = http://www.epa.gov/OMS/climate/420f05001.htm | publisher = [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] | date = February 2005 | work = Office of Transportation and Air Quality | accessdate = 2009-07-28 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090228190530/http://www.epa.gov/oms/climate/420f05001.htm | archivedate = 2009-02-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the carbon content of gasoline, its combustion emits 2.3&amp;nbsp;kg/l (19.4&amp;nbsp;lb/US gal) of [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]; since diesel fuel is more energy dense per unit volume, diesel emits 2.6&amp;nbsp;kg/l (22.2&amp;nbsp;lb/US gal).&lt;ref name="EPA CO2 est" /&gt;  This figure is only the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions of the final fuel product and does not include additional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions created during the drilling, pumping, transportation and refining steps required to produce the fuel. Additional measures to reduce overall emission includes improvements to the efficiency of [[air conditioner]]s, lights and tires.

===Driving technique===
{{Main|Energy-efficient driving}}

Many drivers have the potential to improve their fuel efficiency significantly.&lt;ref name="Beusen"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beusen|title=Using on-board logging devices to study the long-term impact of an eco-driving course|journal=Transportation Research D|volume=14|issue=|pages=514–520|year=2009|month=|pmid=|doi=|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231614817_Using_on-board_logging_devices_to_study_the_long-term_impact_of_an_eco-driving_course?ev=prf_pub|display-authors=etal|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019115218/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/231614817_Using_on-board_logging_devices_to_study_the_long-term_impact_of_an_eco-driving_course?ev=prf_pub|archivedate=2013-10-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/cars-light-trucks/driving/fuel-efficient-driving-techniques/17823 five basic fuel-efficient driving techniques] can be effective. Simple things such as keeping tires properly inflated, having a vehicle well-maintained and avoiding idling can dramatically improve fuel efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://car1.ca/blog/2016/08/02/20-ways-to-improve-your-fuel-efficiency-and-save-money-at-the-pump/|title=20 Ways to Improve Your Fuel Efficiency and Save Money at the Pump|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816132350/http://car1.ca/blog/2016/08/02/20-ways-to-improve-your-fuel-efficiency-and-save-money-at-the-pump/|archivedate=2016-08-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a growing community of enthusiasts known as hypermilers who develop and practice driving techniques to increase fuel efficiency and reduce consumption. Hypermilers have broken records of fuel efficiency, for example, achieving 109 miles per gallon in a [[Prius]]. In non-hybrid vehicles these techniques are also beneficial, with fuel efficiencies of up to 59 MPG in a [[Honda Accord]] or 30 MPG in an [[Acura MDX]].&lt;ref name="This Guy Can Get 59 MPG in a Plain Old Accord. Beat That, Punk."&gt;{{cite news|last=Gaffney|first=Dennis|title=This Guy Can Get 59 MPG in a Plain Old Accord.

==Advanced technology improvements to improve fuel efficiency==
The most efficient machines for converting energy to rotary motion are electric motors, as used in [[electric vehicles]]. However, electricity is not a primary energy source so the efficiency of the electricity production has also to be taken into account. Currently [[railway]] trains can be powered using electricity, delivered through an additional running rail, overhead [[overhead lines|catenary]] system or by on-board generators used in [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] locomotives as common on the US and UK rail networks. Pollution produced from centralised generation of electricity is emitted at a distant power station, rather than "on site". Pollution can be reduced by using more railway electrification and [[low carbon power]] for electricity. Some railways, such as the French SNCF and Swiss federal railways derive most, if not 100% of their power, from hydroelectric or nuclear power stations, therefore atmospheric pollution from their rail networks is very low. This was reflected in a study by AEA Technology between a [[Eurostar]] train and airline journeys between London and Paris, which showed the trains on average emitting 10 times less CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, per passenger, than planes, helped in part by French nuclear generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportenvironment.org/Article267.html|title=Rail 10 times better than air in London-Paris CO2 comparison - Transport &amp; Environment|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928024427/http://www.transportenvironment.org/Article267.html|archivedate=2007-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydrogen Fuel Cells ===
In the future, [[hydrogen vehicle|hydrogen cars]] may be commercially available. Toyota is test marketing hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicles in southern California where a series of hydrogen fueling stations has been established. Powered either through chemical reactions in a [[fuel cell]] that create electricity to drive very efficient electrical motors or by directly burning hydrogen in a combustion engine (near identically to a [[natural gas vehicle]], and similarly compatible with both natural gas and gasoline); these vehicles promise to have near-zero pollution from the tailpipe (exhaust pipe). Potentially the atmospheric pollution could be minimal, provided the hydrogen is made by [[electrolysis]] using electricity from non-polluting sources such as solar, wind or [[hydroelectricity]] or nuclear. Commercial [[hydrogen production]] uses fossil fuels and produces more carbon dioxide than hydrogen.

Because there are pollutants involved in the manufacture and destruction of a car and the production, transmission and storage of electricity and hydrogen, the use of the label "zero pollution" should be understood as applying only to the car's conversion of stored energy into transportation.

In 2004, a consortium of major auto-makers — [[BMW]], [[General Motors]], [[Honda]], [[Toyota]] and [[Volkswagen]]/[[Audi]] — came up with ''"Top Tier Detergent Gasoline Standard"'' to [[gasoline]] brands in the US and Canada that meet their minimum standards for [[detergent]] content&lt;ref name="Top Tier Gasoline"&gt;[http://www.toptiergas.com/retailers.html Top Tier Gasoline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815031514/http://www.toptiergas.com/retailers.html |date=2013-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not contain metallic additives. Top Tier gasoline contains higher levels of detergent additives in order to prevent the build-up of deposits (typically, on [[fuel injector]] and [[intake valve]]) known to reduce fuel economy and engine performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

=== Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) ===
Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) is a technology solution to the challenge of improving energy efficiency for the stationary power generation industry.

Fossil fuel based power generation is predicted to continue for decades, especially in developing economies. This is against the global need to reduce carbon emissions, of which, a high percentage is produced by the power sector worldwide.

ETC works by making gas and diesel-powered gensets (Electric Generators) work more effectively and cleaner, by recovering waste energy from the exhaust to improve power density and fuel efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

* There will be additional weight to add an ETC to a current unit.
* Process still uses fossil fuels, thus still has a carbon footprint in a renewable age.
* They are bespoke to each generator so the design, build and implementation can be a lengthy process.
* There are challenges with high speed turbo generators such as high stress in the rotors, heat generation of the electrical machine and rotordynamics of the turbo generator system.

Gammelmose belonged to the [[Bernstorff  Palace|Bernstorff Estate]] and was used for harvesting of [[peat]]. These resources were almost depleted in the first half of the 19th&amp;nbsp;century. King [[Christian VIII of Denmark|Christian VIII]], who owned the estate, protected the site by royal decree in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Sj%C3%A6lland/Gammelmosen|title=Gammelmosen|language=Danish|publisher=Gyldendal|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done to provide a locality for the scientific study of the natural formation of peat and the recovery of a depleted peat bog. It is the earliest example of a protection of a natural habitat for scientific reasons in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Olsen |first=Søren |date=2015 |title=Kampen om Danmarks natur |trans-title= |url= |language=Danish |location= |publisher=Gads Forlag |pages=54–58 |isbn=978-87-12-05031-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Berlingske&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b.dk/danmark/velkommen-i-gammelmosen|title=Velkommen i Gammelmosen|language=Danish|publisher=Berlingske|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Gammelmose was the first locality to be included under the new Nature Protection Act, and is today listed as an [[IUCN protected area categories#Category IV – Habitat/Species Management Area|IUCN category IV protected area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://protectedplanet.net/gammelmose-protected-by-conservation-order-excl-church-surroundings |title=Gammelmose in Denmark |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Protected Planet |publisher= |access-date=2018-07-11 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area was reduced by three hectares in connection with an expansion of the [[Motorring 3|Ring 3 motorway]]. Only researchers were formerly allowed to enter the nature reserve. In 2008, it was opened to the public on designated paths in the periphery of the area.&lt;ref name=Berlingske/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="104679">'''Global storm activity of 2009''' profiles the major worldwide storms, including blizzards, ice storms, and other winter events, from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009. [[winter storm|Wintery storms]] are events in which the dominant varieties of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] are forms that only occur at cold temperatures, such as snow or [[Freezing rain|sleet]], or a rainstorm where ground temperatures are cold enough to allow ice to form (i.e. [[freezing rain]]). It may be marked by strong wind, thunder and lightning (a thunderstorm), heavy [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], such as ice ([[ice storm]]), or wind transporting some substance through the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] (as in a [[dust storm]], [[snowstorm]], [[hail]]storm, etc.). Summer storms including flooding, severe thunderstorms and [[extratropical cyclone]]s (which can occur in summer or winter) are also included in this list to a certain extent.

As this occurred a heat wave and/or unforeseen [[monsoon]] weather also hit parts of Australia in 2009 and 2010. Victoria, the scene of horrific bushfires the year before, had a far colder summer, with hot weather arriving more than a month later than usual in 2009.&lt;ref name="CCTV1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.cctv.com/20100105/101447.shtml|title=Unusual weather disrupts normal life worldwide|last=Xinhuanet|first=CCTV|author2=Du Xiaodan|date=January 5, 2010|work=Xinhua|publisher=China Central Television|accessdate=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCTV1"/&gt; August 17 saw a dust storm at [[Laguna Mar Chiquita]] as a major drought hit [[Argentina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=39827 |title=Dust Storm in Argentina : Natural Hazards |publisher=Earthobservatory.nasa.gov |accessdate=2011-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[2010 Victorian storms|flooding and hailstorms]] hit southeastern Australia and [[March 2010 Queensland floods|Queensland]] in March 2010. The lack of winter precipitation in parts of China, however, contributed to a [[2010 China drought and dust storms|severe drought]] in the southwest. [[Bolivia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], [[Morocco]] and Spain have also seen periods of drought in 2009 and 2010. On between May 12 and 26, both [[Mauritania]], the [[Sénégal River drainage basin|Sénégal River Area]] and neighbouring parts of both [[Senegal]] and [[Mali]] faced both a drought and famine in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/fromthefield/222031/127409150030.htm |title=News |publisher=AlertNet |accessdate=2011-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/fromthefield/222031/127549655260.htm |title=News |publisher=AlertNet |accessdate=2011-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''storm''' (from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*sturmaz'' "noise, tumult") is any disturbed state of an astronomical body's [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]], especially affecting its surface, and strongly implying [[severe weather]].

Storms are created when a centre of [[Low pressure area|low pressure]] develops, with a system of [[high pressure area|high pressure]] surrounding it. This combination of opposing forces can create winds and result in the formation of storm clouds, such as the [[cumulonimbus cloud|cumulonimbus]]. Small, localized areas of low pressure can form from hot air rising off hot ground, resulting in smaller [[meteorological]] disturbances such as [[dust devils]] and [[whirlwind (atmospheric phenomenon)|whirlwind]]s.

==January==

===December 30-January 1===

An [[Alberta clipper]] affected regions around the [[Great Lakes]], [[Midwestern United States]] and Northeastern United States. [[Greater Toronto Area]] saw about 7–10&amp;nbsp;cm, with higher amounts towards the [[Niagara, Toronto|Niagara]] region. The storm is strengthening over the Atlantic, and could become a [[blizzard]]. [[Northeastern United States]] saw about 10–20&amp;nbsp;cm. The Atlantic provinces were in a [[Blizzard]] for New Year's Day, with 49&amp;nbsp;cm recorded in [[Charlottetown]], [[Prince Edward Island]] and 25&amp;nbsp;cm in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. Blizzard warnings and [[storm surge]] warnings were posted as winds were sustained more than 60–80&amp;nbsp;km (40–50&amp;nbsp;mi), out of the North. [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] saw about 15–25&amp;nbsp;cm of snow, with blowing snow. Another 15–20&amp;nbsp;cm could fall through the province, as another low comes in.

Amounts of 5–15&amp;nbsp;cm of heavy wet snow fell in Metro Vancouver and the surrounding Fraser Valley.

===January 2–4===

January 2 saw a blizzard hit the [[Switzerland|Swiss]]&amp;ndash;[[Liechtenstein]] border, killing an Italian tourist, when his car skidded into a tree due to black ice on the nearby road.

Yet another winter storm developed and brought about 10–25&amp;nbsp;cm across [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]] and through the Northern [[Great Plains]]. 10–20&amp;nbsp;cm also fell through Northern Ontario, with [[freezing rain]], [[ice pellets]] (sleet) and rain to the south. [[Northeastern United States]] can expect ice and snow, with rain down south. Traveling will not be easy.

On the west coast, [[Vancouver]] and the surrounding Fraser Valley got 5–20&amp;nbsp;cm of wet snow, with heavier accumulation towards in the interior of [[British Columbia]], about 10–20&amp;nbsp;cm of dryer, more powdery snow.

===January 5–7===

A major winter storm is developing near the Gulf. It is slowly moving north, and it will be a complex of two lows. [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] recorded about 13&amp;nbsp;cm. Niagara region saw snow mixing with ice pellets and Freezing rain. Eastern Ontario and Southern [[Quebec]] saw amounts of 15–30&amp;nbsp;cm. Similar amounts fell in [[New England]]. The Atlantic provinces saw snow to start then mixing, and rain was reported in some areas.

Snow continued in Metro Vancouver with accumulations of 2–15&amp;nbsp;cm of heavy wet snow.

Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley were stuck with continuing snow from the 1st-5th with accumulations for those 5 days anywhere from 15–30&amp;nbsp;cm of heavy wet snow pile up. As the temperatures rose (up to 10&amp;nbsp;°C), heavy rains came to the area starting on the 6th. Rain amounts on the 6th and the 7th were anywhere from 30 to even 150&amp;nbsp;mm on Western Vancouver Island, the north shore of Vancouver, and sections of the Fraser Valley. In the city of Chilliwack in the Fraser Valley a very deep snow cover, mostly sub-freezing temperatures since December 13, 2008, warm temperatures and heavy rain created flooding concerns for residents living near or on the edge of the Fraser River.

===January 8===
Four died on January 8 during a heavy blizzard in the Indian state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North West Frontier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/LRON-7AREDK?OpenDocument |title=ReliefWeb ť Document ť Pakistan: Snowstorms leave people stranded with little food |publisher=Reliefweb.int |date=2008-01-11 |accessdate=2011-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===January 9–11===

A storm brought 5–15&amp;nbsp;cm across the [[Canadian Prairies]] and through the Great Plains. [[Midwest U.S.]] and Southwestern Ontario could see amounts of 5–25&amp;nbsp;cm. Many areas are reporting heavy amounts of snowfall.

On the west coast, up to 120&amp;nbsp;mm could fall in some areas, as a low pressure area comes in. These latest storms have caused flooding in many areas. Due to excessive snow melt courtesy from the large amounts produced by the December Snowstorms with the [[Pineapple Express]] storm along with heavy rain fall lead to epic flooding. More than 18 rivers went beyond Major Flood stage and a couple went over Record Stage. These floods led the closure of I-5 in Centralia when the Chehalis and Skookumchuck Rivers overflowed. This was the second time in two consecutive years when that Section of I-5 was closed due to flooding.

===January 17–19===

A major winter storm swept across the [[Great Lakes]] region and the U.S. Northeast. Areas of [[Toronto]] recorded between 15–25&amp;nbsp;cm, with 10&amp;nbsp;cm in [[Windsor, Ontario]], &amp; higher amounts towards the Lakes. Some areas reported more than 20&amp;nbsp;cm of accumulation. This same storm affected Northeastern United States with 10–30&amp;nbsp;cm, and the Atlantic provinces of Canada. Some areas have reported [[freezing rain]] and [[ice pellets]], and even rain mixing in. U.S. Southeast saw mostly rain.

===January 25–30===

[[January 2009 Central Plains and Midwest ice storm]]

A potentially severe winter storm is in the developing stages and had already brought more than an inch of ice to many areas in the United States. This system will move across the Midwest into the Northeast. Many places are expecting a major ice storm and areas to the north are expecting significant snowfall accumulations. Over 2 million people were without power throughout the Midwest and North East United States. About 500,000 people in [[Kentucky]] were left Powerless. Ice was thick as 8&amp;nbsp;cm in some areas. There were 23 Deaths, with 6 deaths in [[Texas]]. Regions of [[Southern Ontario]] received between 5–20&amp;nbsp;cm, with 20–30&amp;nbsp;cm in Eastern [[Ontario]] and Southern [[Quebec]]. Similar amounts fell in the Atlantic Provinces, with some rain/snow mixing in at times, as some areas got above the 0 C (32 F) mark.

On January 21, heavy rain cause worst floods in 40 years in Brunei Darussalam. Heavy rains started late on Tuesday in the oil-rich capital of Bandar Seri Begawan, causing flash floods and landslides, interrupting power supply and shutting some telephone lines. About 145.8 millimetres of rainfall was recorded during the 24-hour period from 8 am Tuesday to 8 am Wednesday, according to the weather department, which expects more rain in the coming days but not as heavy as on Tuesday. Two casualties were reported.

On the 27th up to 10&amp;nbsp;cm of heavy wet snow fell in Eastern Metro Vancouver, the surrounding Fraser Valley in British Columbia, and Kitsap Country in Washington. At this point, the winter of 2008-2009 was one of the snowiest in years for Southwestern British Columbia and the pacific northwest as winter storm after winter storm pounded the region from mid-December through to early January. Some locations received up to 125&amp;nbsp;cm of snow during that period and snowcover for Vancouver exceeded 60&amp;nbsp;cm at one point in late December pointing to flood concerns on the then ice-jammed Fraser river.

==February==

===February 1–2 ===
[[File:Snow-Euston 2Feb09-048.JPG|thumb|right|Commuters leaving Euston Station, 2 February 2009]]

A warm, moist Mediterranean cyclone began to move (unusually?) northwards over France, against a cold continental high pressure ridge, causing the cyclone to discharge its moisture as snow over large areas of western Europe. The system was vigorous enough to produce a winter-time tornado in [[Málaga]].

On February 1 and 2, [[United Kingdom snow storm of February 2009|heavy snow fell overnight]] across large parts of the United Kingdom, causing widespread disruption to transport and education. London received its heaviest snowfalls in 18 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7864395.stm BBC News - Heavy snow hits much of England]&lt;/ref&gt; Many roads, including the [[M25 motorway|M25 London Orbital motorway]], were blocked in the morning rush hour, whilst train services are disrupted and many airport runways closed. [[Transport for London]] suspended all [[London Buses]] and the [[London Underground]] was severely disrupted. Hundreds of schools were forced to close.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/4436932/Snow-Councils-and-transport-chiefs-blamed-for-fiasco.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Snow: Councils and transport chiefs blamed for fiasco | first=Nick | last=Allen | date=February 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperatures fell below seasonal averages with [[Chesham]], [[Buckinghamshire]] recording -10 degrees Celsius at night.

Airports were affected included London's [[Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]] and [[Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] airports. [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] and [[Orly Airport]] were affected.

Spain, Germany, Portugal and Ireland were also affected. In Ireland, snowstorms disrupted road and rail transport, including the M50 and M1. [[Dublin Airport]] and [[Cork Airport]] were severely disrupted, as were ferry services in the Irish Sea throughout February 2.

Ireland was affected in a similar way to the UK. In the Republic, the South and East were the worst affected. Due to black ice, driving was very treacherous, with ice and snow blocking many major routes such as the M1 and M50. Dublin Airport and Cork Airport were seriously affected, with many flights to Britain and Europe delayed and cancelled. The major rail routes across Ireland were closed down, as a result of bad ice and snow. Temperatures across Ireland fell below average everywhere, with temperatures of -8 and -9 degrees Celsius recorded in places.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

The snow was a result of wind blowing across from West Siberia, and reacted with the low pressure system approaching across from the Atlantic. This created unusually large amounts of snow, which fell across England, Wales and Eastern Ireland. This weather type is rare in Ireland, and is normally confined to small amounts; however, the total amount of snowfall in this storm was the highest since 1981.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

A winter storm developing over the Gulf states and through the [[Gulf of Mexico]], is bringing widespread Heavy Rain to the South Eastern States of the US. Up to 100&amp;nbsp;mm is possible in some areas. Coastal areas of North Eastern United States can expect snowfall of up to 6&amp;nbsp;inches (15&amp;nbsp;cm) in some areas, local amounts may be higher. Atlantic Canada will see strong winds and snowfall amounts of 15–30&amp;nbsp;cm (6–12&amp;nbsp;inches).

A small weather system carrying snow that developed in North France reached [[South East England]] and the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] which brought 20–30&amp;nbsp;cm (8–12&amp;nbsp;inches) of snow in some parts of [[Gloucestershire]]. Further snow came in from the south and east throughout the week. The worst places affected was the [[Forest of Dean]] and [[The Cotswolds]]. On 6 February a few small towns in [[Devon]] reported around 55&amp;nbsp;cm (22&amp;nbsp;inches) of lying snow ([[Okehampton]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7874115.stm | work=BBC News | title=UK prepares for freezing weekend | date=February 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Severn Bridge]], the main link between England and Wales closed due to falling ice for the first time. Some 321 schools in [[Buckinghamshire]], 300 schools in [[Gloucestershire]] and 307 schools in [[Wales]] also closed on the 6th.

===February 6–12===

About 3,000 people were killed as a storm complex paced over [[Haiti]] on the 6th &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/db/crisisprofiles/LA_FLO.htm |title=Haiti floods 2008 |publisher=AlertNet |accessdate=2011-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A winter storm from the Atlantic reached southern Britain and the Midlands on 9–10 causing heavy rain and flooding. Across the midlands and further north, it was cold enough for it to fall as snow. Coupled with the strong winds, it made [[blizzard]] conditions. The Met office issued an extreme winter storm warning for many counties in Great Britain. Meanwhile, a temperature of {{convert|-18|°C}} was recorded in the [[Scottish Highlands]] — the coldest UK temperature since 2003. Smaller outbreaks of snow occurred across parts of the north and east of England on 12–13 February.

A major storm developing over [[Texas]] is affecting many communities in North America. Areas like [[Oklahoma City]] were hit hard with heavy rain, hail and a [[tornado]] in western Oklahoma City. There have been numerous spottings of funnel clouds. Heavy rain continues through Texas and [[Kansas]], which will extend into [[Missouri]], [[Arkansas]] and [[Louisiana]]. Areas of [[Michigan]], [[Illinois]] and SW [[Ontario]] could see pop-up thunderstorms, but likely not as severe. Northern Ontario will see mostly an ice-rain event. While areas to the South could see 25–50&amp;nbsp;mm (1–2&amp;nbsp;inches).

===February 16–20===

A major storm affected [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] with strong winds gusting to 100&amp;nbsp;km/h in some areas. Bitterly cold conditions, strong winds and heavy snowfall caused a [[blizzard]] through parts of Newfoundland. Some areas of Newfoundland received between 20–40&amp;nbsp;cm. Local areas and local drifts were locally higher.

A winter storm that developed over [[Colorado]] brought messy weather across the Great plains, [[Midwest U.S.]], the [[Great Lakes]] and Northeast United States. Some areas had a messy mix of snow, ice and rain. [[Toronto]] had seen about 10&amp;nbsp;cm. [[South Western Ontario]] saw between 1–10&amp;nbsp;cm. Northern Areas of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] received between 10–25&amp;nbsp;cm. [[Eastern Ontario]] received between 10–20&amp;nbsp;cm. The northeast saw local amounts of over 15&amp;nbsp;cm. From Midwestern sections of the U.S. to the Southern Lakes messy mix was reported with rain at times. Southern United States saw heavy amounts of rainfall, [[Thunderstorms]] and [[Tornado warnings]] were issued in some areas.

The Atlantic provinces are seeing heavy snowfall and some mixed precipitation. Areas could exceed 10&amp;nbsp;cm. [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] could get more heavy snowfall.

===February 21–23===

An Alberta clipper, which picked up moisture from the Gulf, dumped about 5–20&amp;nbsp;cm across the [[Midwest]], and the [[Great lakes]] area. Areas like [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] saw close to 15&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Toronto]] saw about 5–12&amp;nbsp;cm. [[Eastern Ontario]] and Southern [[Quebec]] could see slightly higher amounts as a coastal low develops, and gives heavier snow. Northeastern United States are seeing snow, mix precipitation and rainfall. The heavier snowfall is towards New England and Maine.

Atlantic Canada is seeing [[blizzard]] like conditions. 15–40&amp;nbsp;cm is possible is some areas. Winter storm warnings and snowfall warnings are in place.

{{Main|October 2009 North American storm complex}}

Late on October 11, the disorganized remnants of [[Typhoon Melor (2009)|Super Typhoon Melor]] were absorbed by another low-pressure system just north of it,&lt;ref name="wunderground.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1350 |title=Wunder Blog : Weather Underground |publisher=Wunderground.com |accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to how [[Typhoon Kujira (2009)|Typhoon Kujira]]'s remnants were absorbed by another extratropical system. The extratropical cyclone rapidly intensified as it neared the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Several wind and flood watches/warnings were issued on October 17 in advance for the expected arrival of the winter storm. A high wave advisory was issued for the entire western seaboard. Just before midnight of October 18, the powerful winter storm struck [[California]] with gale-force winds and torrential rainfall. In [[Northern California]], the rainfall was seemingly endless. The [[San Francisco Bay]]&lt;ref name="wunderground.com"/&gt; area suffered the most damage, from 40-foot (12&amp;nbsp;m) high waves and reported gusts of 85&amp;nbsp;mph (140&amp;nbsp;km/h). A rare storm warning was posted for San Francisco Bay and subsequently, wind gusts were clocked at 75&amp;nbsp;mph (125&amp;nbsp;km/h) on [[Angel Island (California)|Angel Island]]. While the main system remained offshore, the storm's moisture split into two new systems over the [[Western United States]], which rapidly moved eastward across the US, bringing strong winds and heavy rain. On December 20, after looping back north into the [[Gulf of Alaska]], the storm complex was absorbed by another stronger extratropical cyclone approaching from the west. The damage that the storm complex caused is currently estimated at about $1.18 million (2009 USD).

Heavy snow fell in parts of Pennsylvania between October 15 and 16. State College, Pennsylvania saw ten inches (254&amp;nbsp;mm) of wet snow, causing a very memorable Penn State homecoming game, and breaking numerous records, such as earliest recorded snowfall, most severe October snowstorm, and most snow in the month of October. Moderate snow fell between October 15 and 18 in the [[Northeastern United States]], as far as the suburbs of [[New York City]], with light snow being reported in the city itself. [[Boston]] suburbs saw moderate, wet snow fall on the morning of October 16, in spots accumulating up to {{convert|0.5|in|mm}}. The area was then hit on October 18, when in the afternoon, heavy rain turned to heavy snow and almost white-out conditions. The ground was too warm for any significant accumulation, but up to {{convert|2|in|mm}} were reported at spots between Boston and [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]]. All of the snow melted by October 20.

===November 25–30===
On November 25, a cold extratropical cyclone tracked into Russia's [[Primorsky Krai|Primorsky]] Territory from the [[Yellow Sea]]. [[Weather forecasters]] correctly predicted snow, [[gale]]-force wind and temperatures between 0 and −2&amp;nbsp;°C, with one night's temperature drop reaching −25°С. Over the next week the daytime temperature was predicted to be between 2°С to -10°С, with a nighttime temperature between −24 and −25&amp;nbsp;°C.

A powerful storm (probably the earlier one from Primorsky Krai) stalled in the [[Gulf of Alaska]] on November 25. On the 26th, its wind field produced high tides on the western seaboard. The storm weakened significantly on the 27th and moved towards [[Southern California|Southern]] [[California]], bringing heavy rainfall starting early in the morning and causing strong winds. The storm left Southern California and moved on to batter the east coast during the afternoon of Sunday, November 29, 2009. A heavy and snowy [[cyclone]] hit the Aleutian islands on November 30.

By November 27 heavy rain was moving over the [[Irish Sea]] is set to give some heavy rain then turning to snow over parts of the [[Peak District]], with altitudes above 1000&amp;nbsp;feet (300&amp;nbsp;m), dropping over 2&amp;nbsp;inches (5.1&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow in some places. This is the usual snowfall for parts of [[Scotland]], including the [[West Highlands]] and the [[East Highlands]].

A weak disturbance that started overnight on December 6 stalled over the western United States and intensified rapidly. Heavy downpours began early in the morning of December 7 and continued non-stop until the evening, triggering flash-flood watches. The storm dropped as much as 4.5&amp;nbsp;in (110&amp;nbsp;mm) of rain in [[Cuyamaca]], San Diego, causing blackouts in some locations. This storm was followed by a small semi-tropical winter storm which started overnight on December 10 and then stalled over [[Southern California]] and intensified, causing heavy downpours. In addition to {{convert|4|in|mm}} of rain, this storm gave [[pea]]-sized-[[hail]] and gusty winds before weakening and moving away from Southern California on December 13.

Heavy snow hit [[Wisconsin]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Washington, D.C. and parts of [[Maryland]] on the 10th and 14th. Heavy rain hit parts of [[Arizona]] on the 11th.

In Vancouver, BC a strong winter storm deposited anywhere from 10–30&amp;nbsp;cm of heavy snow from the night of the 12th through to the morning of the 15th after a frigid arctic air that had been over the region for days with as low as -15&amp;nbsp;°C temperatures met with moist Pacific air.

===December 8–16===
Light snow began to fall in the [[Grampian Mountains]] on December 8. On the 8th more heavy snow showers followed on the 18th.

Various [[weather forecast]]s suggested that one would spread valley rain and mountain snow across [[Northern California]] and drop up to half an inch of rain across the northern [[Sacramento Valley]] &lt;ref name="redding.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=primalux writes: |url=http://www.redding.com/news/2009/dec/28/it-will-be-a-damp-end-for-2009-in-north-state/ |title=It will be a damp end for 2009 in north state |publisher=Redding Record Searchlight |accessdate=2010-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315132656/http://www.redding.com/news/2009/dec/28/it-will-be-a-damp-end-for-2009-in-north-state/ |archivedate=2010-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; over the next few days. The [[National Weather Service]] issued a [[Winter Weather Advisory]] warning for the [[Mount Shasta]] area,&lt;ref name="redding.com"/&gt; where forecasters expected 1 to {{convert|3|in|mm}} of snow in town and up to {{convert|10|in|mm}} above {{convert|5000|ft|m}}. The second cold front, and its related storm, would bring more rain and high country snow to the north state by [[New Year's Eve]] or [[New Year's Day]].&lt;ref name="redding.com"/&gt;

The blizzards began on [[New Year's Eve]], and lasted until January 3. The worst of the blizzards occurred on December 31, when an [[avalanche]] [[derailment|derailed]] a [[diesel locomotive]] fitted with a railway [[snowplough]] off its railway tracks.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; The storm continued through 1 January, when three workers sent to repair the damage were swept away by the howling [[blizzard]] that was ripping through [[Sakhalin Island]] according to the [[RIA Novosti]] news service.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; One worker was found alive and rescue teams retrieved the body of a second Sunday morning.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; The situation worsened to the point that 140 [[soldiers]] were ordered to help dig the train out from beneath {{convert|350,000|cuft|m3}} of snow.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; A local man, Andrei Sukhonosov, trying to return home to the city of [[Tomari, Russia|Tomari]] was on the buried train.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Authorities and rescue services in [[Sakhalin Oblast]] were put on alert, and warned of a high risk of [[avalanche]]s on the island's numerous hills and mountains.&lt;ref name="itar-tass.com"/&gt; Another avalanche warning was issued on the 2nd, for [[Sakhalin Island]], due to hazardous levels of [[snowfall]] during yet another [[Siberian snow cyclone]] and [[blizzard]], emergency officials said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/International/2010/01/02/Russian-island-enduring-snow-cyclone/UPI-19541262458995/ |title=Russian island enduring snow cyclone |publisher=UPI.com |date=2010-01-02 |accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities in Primorsky and [[Khabarovsk Krai]] were also put on alert, just in case things got ant worse.&lt;ref name="itar-tass.com"/&gt; The last two [[Russian Far East]]ern storms dissipated in the [[Gulf of Alaska]] on January 5 and 6 respectively.

===December 29–31===
Following the deadly [[2009 North American Christmas winter storm]], a medium-sized [[nor'easter]] formed in [[Texas]] and brought moderate snow to the western portion of the state on December 29. In anticipation of the event Texas Governor [[Rick Perry]] activated his resources ahead of the winter storm.&lt;ref name="KLTV1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kltv.com/Global/story.asp?S=11741942|title=Gov.

Some snow was reported in [[Clayton, Georgia]] but did not accumulate. It then moved quickly up the [[East Coast of the United States]], bringing freezing rain and sleet to the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] and moderate to heavy snow to the Tri-State Area (New York, New Jersey, Connecticut). 5&amp;nbsp;inches (12.7&amp;nbsp;cm) at the most was reported in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]] 4.5&amp;nbsp;inches (11.4&amp;nbsp;cm) in [[Hartford]]. It then brought about 2&amp;nbsp;inches (5&amp;nbsp;cm) to [[Boston]] and southeastern [[New England]]. Overnight January 1, it strengthened explosively over water and looped back around to create a [[blizzard]] in northern New England. Up to 19&amp;nbsp;inches (48&amp;nbsp;cm) was on the ground in [[Lubec, Maine]] by Sunday, and on Saturday it moved to southern New England. 13&amp;nbsp;inches (33&amp;nbsp;cm) fell in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]] making that the most fallen in southern New England in the season. Boston received 9&amp;nbsp;inches (23&amp;nbsp;cm). The storm moved into the [[Labrador Sea]] by Sunday afternoon, leaving behind a pattern where multiple storms within the broader low undergo [[cyclogenesis]] to track north of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].

[[Sportscotland Avalanche Information Service]] (SAIS) issued warnings about conditions on Scottish mountains on December 30.&lt;ref name=BBC30Dec09a /&gt; However, three people died in three large avalanches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5goM5jhhBUYkvn5NImh-lWgObRy8A |title=Three climbers die in avalanches |publisher=The Press Association |date=30 December 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two climbers were killed as a result of an avalanche on [[Ben Nevis]], while a man was airlifted from [[Liathach]], a mountain in [[Torridon]], after getting into trouble, and died in hospital.&lt;ref name=BBC30Dec09a &gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/8434825.stm |title=Three climbers die in avalanches |publisher=BBC News |date=30 December 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued icy weather in Scotland on [[New Year's Eve]] led to the cancellation of [[Hogmanay]] celebrations in [[Inverness]] amid concerns over public safety.&lt;ref name=BBC01Jan10a &gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8435378.stm |title=Snow forces cancellation of Inverness Hogmanay party |publisher=BBC News |date=31 December 2009 |accessdate=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Year celebrations in other parts of Scotland went ahead as planned.&lt;ref name=BBC01Jan10a /&gt; North-east Scotland experienced fresh snowfall during the afternoon and evening of 31 December. For a second time that week [[Inverness Airport]] was closed forcing several hundred passengers to make alternative arrangements. In [[Batley]], [[West Yorkshire]] {{convert|2,500|impgal|m3}} of water leaked into the local gas network, leaving 400 homes in [[Dewsbury]] and Batley without gas during sub-zero temperatures. The final homes were reconnected on 7 January.&lt;ref name=BBC04Jan10a &gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bradford/8439048.stm |title=Hundreds without gas after flood |publisher=BBC News |date=4 January 2010 |accessdate=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

December 31 to January 5 saw heavy flooding in southern Spain and heavy snow in northern Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2010-01/06/content_12766089.htm |title=Spain shuts down 30 major roads due to heavy rain, snow_English_Xinhua |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2010-01-06 |accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political impact==

Much of the snowstorm activity coincided with [[Copenhagen Summit]] of December 2009 as well as the [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy]] one month prior. The unusual weather patterns that year (particularly in the Southern United States) provided an opportunity to promote or question the theory of [[global warming]], and led to an increasing use of the phrase "[[climate change]]" as opposed to "global warming."{{cn|date=October 2018}}

[[File:North Pacific Gyre World Map.png|thumb|350px|The area of increased plastic particles is located within the [[North Pacific Gyre]], one of the five major [[ocean gyre]]s.|alt=Map showing the oceans' five major gyres]]The '''Great Pacific garbage patch''', also described as the '''Pacific trash vortex''', is a [[ocean gyre|gyre]] of [[marine debris]] particles in the central [[North Pacific Ocean]]. It is located roughly from [[135th meridian west|135°W]] to [[155th meridian west|155°W]] and [[35th parallel north|35°N]] to [[42nd parallel north|42°N]].&lt;ref&gt;See the relevant sections below for specific references concerning the discovery and history of the patch. A general overview is provided in Dautel, Susan L. "Transoceanic Trash: International and United States Strategies for the Great Pacific Garbage Patch", 3 Golden Gate U. Envtl. L.J. 181 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of plastic, floating trash halfway between Hawaii and California&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/2018/03/22/great-pacific-garbage-patch-grows/446405002/|title=World's largest collection of ocean garbage is twice the size of Texas|work=USA TODAY|access-date=29 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; extends over an indeterminate area of widely varying range depending on the degree of [[plastic]] concentration used to define it.

The patch is characterized by exceptionally high relative [[pelagic zone|pelagic]] concentrations of [[plastic]], [[chemical sludge]], and other [[debris]] that have been trapped by the currents of the [[North Pacific Gyre]].&lt;ref&gt;For this and what follows, see Moore (2004) and Moore (2009), which includes photographs taken from the patch,&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the common public image of islands of floating rubbish, its low density (4 particles per cubic meter) prevents detection by [[satellite imagery]], or even by casual boaters or divers in the area. It consists primarily of an increase in suspended, often microscopic, particles in the upper [[water column]].

The patch is not easily seen from the sky, because the plastic is dispersed over a large area. Researchers from [[The Ocean Cleanup]] project claimed that the patch covers 1.6 million square kilometers. The plastic concentration is estimated to be up to 100 kilograms per square kilometer in the center, going down to 10 kilograms per square kilometer in the outer parts of the patch. An estimated 80,000 metric tons of plastic inhabit the patch, totaling 1.8 trillion pieces. 92% of the mass in the patch comes from objects larger than 0.5 centimeters.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theoceancleanup.com/great-pacific-garbage-patch/|title=The Great Pacific Garbage Patch – The Ocean Cleanup|last=www.theoceancleanup.com|first=The Ocean Cleanup,|website=The Ocean Cleanup|language=en|access-date=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Research indicates that the patch is rapidly accumulating.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

A similar patch of floating plastic debris is found in the Atlantic Ocean, called the [[North Atlantic garbage patch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/03/100302-new-ocean-trash-garbage-patch/|title=Huge Garbage Patch Found in Atlantic Too|last=Lovett|first=Richard A.|date=2 March 2010|work=National Geographic News|publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8534052.stm|title=Plastic rubbish blights Atlantic Ocean|author=Victoria Gill|date=24 February 2010|accessdate=16 March 2010|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further north, water moves east to Central America, and then joins a larger movement further north, which loops south, west, north, and east between North America and Japan. Two smaller loops circle in the eastern and central North Pacific.]]

The patch was described in a 1988 paper published by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA). The description was based on research by several Alaska-based researchers in 1988 who measured [[neuston]]ic [[plastic]] in the North Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers found relatively high concentrations of marine debris accumulating in regions governed by ocean currents. Extrapolating from findings in the [[Sea of Japan]], the researchers hypothesized that similar conditions would occur in other parts of the Pacific where prevailing currents were favorable to the creation of relatively stable waters. They specifically indicated the North Pacific Gyre.&lt;ref&gt;"After entering the ocean, however, neuston plastic is redistributed by currents and winds. For example, plastic entering the ocean in Japan is moved eastward by the Subarctic Current (in Subarctic Water) and the Kuroshio (in Transitional Water, Kawai 1972; Favorite et al. 1976; Nagata et al. 1986). In this way, the plastic is transported from high-density areas to low-density areas. In addition to this eastward movement, Ekman stress from winds tends to move surface waters from the subarctic and the subtropics toward the Transitional Water mass as a whole (see Roden 1970: fig. 5). Because of the convergent nature of this Ekman flow, densities tend to be high in Transitional Water. ''In addition, the generally convergent nature of water in the North Pacific Central Gyre (Masuzawa 1972) should result in high densities there also.''" Day, etc... 1988, p. 261 (Emphasis added)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles J. Moore]], returning home through the North Pacific Gyre after competing in the [[Transpacific Yacht Race]] in 1997, &lt;!-- See paragraph below: "small pieces ... almost invisible ... suspended beneath the surface ... relatively low density"--&gt;claimed to have come upon an enormous stretch of floating debris. Moore alerted the [[oceanography|oceanographer]] [[Curtis Ebbesmeyer]], who subsequently dubbed the region the "Eastern Garbage Patch" (EGP).&lt;ref name="natural history"&gt;{{cite journal| title= Across the Pacific Ocean, plastics, plastics, everywhere |last= Moore |first= Charles |date= November 2003 |publisher= [[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History Magazine]] |url= http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/htmlsite/master.html?http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/htmlsite/1103/1103_feature.html |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area is frequently featured in media reports as an exceptional example of [[marine pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Calling his project [[The Ocean Cleanup]], he proposed to use surface currents to let debris drift to collection platforms. Operating costs would be relatively modest and the operation would be so efficient that it might even be profitable. The concept makes use of floating booms that divert rather than catch the debris.

Karl, "A Sea of Change: Biogeochemical Variability in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre", Ecosystems, Vol. 2, No. 3 (May – Jun. 1999), pp. 181–214 and, for gyres generally, Sverdrup HU, Johnson MW, Fleming RH. 1946.

The gyre's rotational pattern draws in waste material from across the North Pacific, including coastal waters off North America and Japan. As material is captured in the currents, wind-driven surface currents gradually move debris toward the center, trapping it.

==Size estimates==
[[File:Garbage Patch Visualization Experiment.webm|thumb|Visualisation showing ocean garbage patches]]The size of the patch is indefinite, as is the precise distribution of debris, because large items are uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-40584629|title=A mission to the Pacific plastic patch|last=Brassey|first=Dr Charlotte|date=16 July 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=21 July 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most debris consists of small plastic particles suspended at or just below the surface, evading detection by aircraft or satellite. Instead, the size of the patch is determined by sampling. Estimates of size range from [[orders of magnitude (area)#108 to 1014 sqm|{{convert|700000|km2|mi2}}]] (about the size of Texas) to more than {{convert|15000000|km2|mi2}} (about the size of Russia). Such estimates, however, are conjectural given the complexities of sampling and the need to assess findings against other areas. Further, although the size of the patch is determined by a higher-than-normal degree of concentration of [[pelagic]] debris, there is no standard for determining the boundary between "normal" and "elevated" levels of pollutants to provide a firm estimate of the affected area.

{{quote|Net-based surveys are less subjective than direct observations but are limited regarding the area that can be sampled (net apertures 1–2 m and ships typically have to slow down to deploy nets, requiring dedicated ship's time). The plastic debris sampled is determined by net mesh size, with similar mesh sizes required to make meaningful comparisons among studies. Floating debris typically is sampled with a [[neuston]] or [[manta trawl]] net lined with 0.33 mm mesh. Given the very high level of spatial clumping in marine litter, large numbers of net tows are required to adequately characterize the average abundance of litter at sea. Long-term changes in plastic meso-litter have been reported using surface net tows: in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre in 1999, plastic abundance was 335,000 items/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 5.1&amp;nbsp;kg/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, roughly an order of magnitude greater than samples collected in the 1980s. Similar dramatic increases in plastic debris have been reported off Japan. However, caution is needed in interpreting such findings, because of the problems of extreme spatial heterogeneity, and the need to compare samples from equivalent water masses, which is to say that, if an examination of the same parcel of water a week apart is conducted, an order of magnitude change in plastic concentration could be observed.&lt;ref name="Ryan et al 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0207 |title=Monitoring the abundance of plastic debris in the marine environment |year=2009 |last1=Ryan |first1=P.

In March 2018, [[The Ocean Cleanup]] published a paper summarizing their findings from the Mega- (2015) and Aerial Expedition (2016). In 2015, the organization crossed the Great Pacific garbage patch with 30 vessels, to make observations and take samples with 652 survey nets. They collected a total of 1.2 million pieces, which they counted and categorized into their respective size classes. In order to also account for the larger, but more rare larger debris, they also overflew the patch in 2016 with a [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]] aircraft, equipped with [[Lidar|LiDAR sensors]]. The findings from the two expeditions, found that the patch covers 1.6 million square kilometers with a concentration of 10–100 kg per square kilometer. They estimate an 80,000 metric tons in the patch, with 1.8 trillion plastic pieces, out of which 92% of the mass is to be found in objects larger than 0.5 centimeters.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theoceancleanup.com/updates/the-exponential-increase-of-the-great-pacific-garbage-patch/|title=The Exponential Increase of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch|last=www.theoceancleanup.com|first=The Ocean Cleanup,|work=The Ocean Cleanup|access-date=8 May 2018|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lebreton|first=L.|last2=Slat|first2=B.|last3=Ferrari|first3=F.|last4=Sainte-Rose|first4=B.|last5=Aitken|first5=J.|last6=Marthouse|first6=R.|last7=Hajbane|first7=S.|last8=Cunsolo|first8=S.|last9=Schwarz|first9=A.|date=22 March 2018|title=Evidence that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is rapidly accumulating plastic|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-22939-w|issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2018NatSR...8.4666L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As it disintegrates, the pieces become small enough to be ingested by aquatic organisms that reside near the ocean's surface.

Disintegration means that much of the plastic is too small to be seen.

===Spreading invasive species===
Marine plastics facilitate the spread of invasive species that attach to floating plastic in one region and drift long distances to colonize other ecosystems.&lt;ref name="sierra"/&gt; Debris affects at least 267 species worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| first1=Michelle |last1=Allsopp |first2=Adam |last2=Walters |first3=David |last3=Santillo |first4=Paul |last4=Johnston |url=https://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/Global/international/planet-2/report/2007/8/plastic_ocean_report.pdf |title=Plastic Debris in the World's Oceans |publisher=Greenpeace |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Increasing microplastic concentrations has released the insect ''[[Halobates|Halobates sericeus]]'' from substrate limitation. A positive correlation between H. sericeus and microplastic was observed, along with increasing ''H. sericeus'' egg densities.&lt;ref name=GRC/&gt;

'''Harpans kraft''' (Swedish) or '''Harpens kraft''' (Danish), meaning "The Power of the Harp," is the title of a supernatural ballad type, attested in Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, and Icelandic examples.

In ''[[The Types of the Scandinavian Medieval Ballad]]'' it is catalogued type A 50, "Man saves his bride from [[merman]] by playing his harp."

The ballad type tells of a hero whose betrothed has premonitions of a fall from a bridge into the river, which despite the hero's assurances and precautions comes true. But by the power of his harp-playing, he regains his bride from the river creature, which is referred to as a "merman" in the TSB catalog,&lt;ref name="tsb-a50"&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnsson|Solheim|Danielson|1978|loc=''Types of the Scand. Med. Ballad'', p.39}}&lt;/ref&gt; but more precisely given as "[[neck (water spirit)]]" or troll in the original Scandinavian texts.

The ballad of this type occur under the following titles. Danish: "Harpens kraft" (''[[Danmarks gamle Folkeviser|DgF]]'' 40); Swedish: "Harpans kraft"  (''[[Sveriges Medeltida Ballader|SMB]]'' 22); Norwegian: ''Villemann og Magnhild'' ([[Norske mellomalderballadar|NMB]] 26); ''Gaute og Magnild'' and ''Guðmund og Signelita'' ([[Magnus Brostrup Landstad|Landstad]] 51 and 52), etc.; and Icelandic: ''Gautakvæði'' "Gauti's ballad".{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|Bibiliographical list of analogue ballads in different languages, given in ''The Types of the Scandinavian Medieval Ballad'' under A 50.&lt;ref name="tsb-a50"/&gt;}}

Noted for its resemblance to the Greek myth of [[Orpheus]], a harp-player with mystical powers, it may be related to medieval versions of that story such as the Middle English ''[[Sir Orfeo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Aðalheiður Guðmundsdóttir, 'Gunnarr and the Snake Pit in Medieval Art and Legend', ''Speculum'', 87 (2012), 1015-49 (p. 1044); doi:10.1017/S0038713412003144; [http://uni.hi.is/adalh/files/2013/01/Speculum.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The harp's effects on "''Dyr og Fugle'' (beasts an birds)", etc.{{Harvnb|Bugge|year=1891|loc=Arkiv för nordisk filologi '''7''', pp.101, 106, 113-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Støa|2008|p=17}}, citing Kittredge 187, Liestøl and Moe 91, Spring 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarity has also been noted with the supernatural power of the harp in the Scottish ballad ''[[Glasgerion]]'' ([[Child ballad]] 67 variants B, C, "He'd harpit a fish out o saut water," etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Child|first=James Francis|chapter=67.|title=The English and Scottish Popular Ballads|volume=Part III (Vol. 2, part 1)|year=1885|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9IVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA136|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bugge|year=1891|loc=Arkiv för nordisk filologi '''7''', p.114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common plot ==
A bridegroom asks his betrothed why she is so sorrowful. At last she answers that she is going to fall into a river on her way to her wedding (as her sisters have done before her, in some Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish variants). The man promises to build a broad, strong bridge over the river, and he and his men will protect her. Despite precautions, the maiden's horse stumbles (or rears up) while over the bridge, and she tumbles into the river. The man has his golden harp brought to him and plays so beautifully that the "merman" (Danish: ''trold''; Swedish: ''neck'' i.e. "[[neck (water spirit)]]") is forced to return his betrothed.&lt;ref name="tsb-a50"/&gt;{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|Larsen's summary consults Jonsson et al, ''TSB'' summary, but differs somewhat.&lt;ref name="larsen107-108"/&gt;}}

There exist Danish, Norwegian and Swedish variants where the water spirit restores the bride's two other sisters (or however many) who had been previously taken by the creature.&lt;ref name="tsb-a50"/&gt;&lt;ref name="larsen107-108"/&gt; The Icelandic version has a tragic ending, and the hero only recovers his bride's corpse.&lt;ref name="tsb-a50"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kemp|1936|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A list of available translations of the ballads from various Scandinavian languages are given under [[#English Translations|English Translations]] below.

==Danish version==
The Danish analogue is ''Harpens kraft'' (''[[Danmarks gamle Folkeviser]]'' no. 40). There are six versions (DgF 40A&amp;ndash;F), taken mostly from manuscripts such as [[Karen Brahes Folio]] of the 1570s (Variant A). There is a broadside copy dating to 1778 (designated variant E). Another recension (variant F) has Swedish provenance, being copied out of a manuscript written in 1693 by a Swede in [[Näsum|Næsum]] parish, [[Skåne County]], Sweden, but Grundtvig counted it as a Danish example since the language was Danish, and it was suitable for comparing with text E.&lt;ref name="larsen107-108"&gt;{{Harvnb|Larsen|2004|pp=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dgf40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Grundtvig|1856|loc=Vol. 2, Nr. 40, pp.63-64 (preface); 65-70 (texts); 70-72 (variant readings)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Translations under the title "The Power of the Harp" exist, including one by R. C. Alexander Prior (1860)&lt;ref name="prior"/&gt; and by [[George Borrow]] (1913, 1923).&lt;ref name="borrow"/&gt;

==Swedish version==
[[Erik Gustaf Geijer|Geijer]] and [[Arvid August Afzelius|Afzelius]] gave 3 examples of ''Harpans kraft'' (GA 91, or in the later edition with Bergström, GAB 75).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geijer|Afzelius|1816|loc=Nr. 91, pp.140-147}}{{Harvnb|Geijer|Afzelius|Bergström|1880|loc=Nr. 75, pp.352-356}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, the Swedish form is attested in ''[[Sveriges Medeltida Ballader]]'' (no. 22) in forty-nine variants (two of which are from Finland) from the 1690s onward (twenty-one variants of which have melodies). It may be noted that the earliest example included in ''SMB'' is the same as that catalogued as Danish ballad variant (DgF 40F) mentioned above, and which the early Swedish collectors concurred it was a "''halft dansk'' (half Danish)" specimen.&lt;ref name="gab-notes"&gt;{{Harvnb|Geijer|Afzelius|Bergström|1880|loc=Vol. II, Anmärkingar, Nr. 75, pp.306-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gijer and Afzelius's first variant (GA 91.1=SMB 22 H&lt;ref&gt;Identification of translation sources and SMB variant according to {{Harvnb|Syndergaard|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;) localized in [[Östergötland]] has been translated as "Power of the Harp" by [[Edward Vaughan Kenealy]] (1864).&lt;ref name="kinealy"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenealy|1864|pp=376–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third variant (GA 91.3 =SMB 22J) from [[Västergötland]] and [[Vermland]] was translated by [[Thomas Keightley]] in his "The Fairy Mythology" (1828).&lt;ref name="keightley"&gt;{{Harvnb|Keightley|1850|pp=150–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|GAB gives localization to GA 1 and 3, but for GA 2 merely states it is from another tradition.&lt;ref name="gab-notes"/&gt;}}

In the first variant (Kenealy tr.), the hero and bride are anonymous and merely called "young swain (''Ungersven'')" and maiden, whereas in the third variant (Keightley tr.) they are named  "Peder" and "Liten Kerstin" respectively.

The name of the feared river may be given as [[Värnamo Municipality|Vernamo]] river (GA 1), Ringfalla (GA 3), or Renfalla, Vendels, etc.&lt;ref name="gab-notes"/&gt; A version explains the bride's guardsmen abandoned her side to go hunting when they spotted a "hart with gilded horns" in Ringfalla woods (GA 3, Keightley's translation).

The motif of harp-playing which forces a supernatural being to act in a certain way is also found in ''[[Sveriges Medeltida Ballader]]'' 21 G of ''[[Ungersven och havsfrun]]'' (which also ends happily). Conversely, the plot of variant 20 L (''Necken bejlare'') is very similar to this ballad type, except that the bride's rescue by the harp has been deleted (and thus the ballad ends unhappily).

== Norwegian version ==
In Norway the ballad is generally known as ''Villemann og Magnhild'' and catalogued as ''Norske mellomalderballadar'' (NMB) no. 26&lt;ref&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|Ådel Gjøstein Blom{{!}}Blom|2=no|3=Ådel Gjøstein Blom|preserve=1}} ed., ''Norske mellomalderballadar''&lt;/ref&gt; There are some 100 variants, although this count tallies up many fragmentary redactions only few stanzas long.&lt;ref name="30balladen-084"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nork visearkiv|2011|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Variant 96 given in [http://www.dokpro.uio.no/ballader/lister/tsbalfa_titler/tittel_314a.html Villemann og Magnhild], Dokumentasjons-prosjektet&lt;/ref&gt;

Some variants are known by other titles: ''Harpespelet tvingar nykken'' in [[Leiv Heggstad]]'s collection,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Heggstad|1912|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two specimens called ''Gaute og Magnild'' and ''Guðmund og Signelita'' in the anthology compiled by [[Magnus Brostrup Landstad|Landstad]] (1853).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landstad|1853|loc=Nr. 51., p. 469-; Nr. 52., p.476-}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The version most often met in Norwegian songbooks today is [[Knut Liestøl]] and [[Moltke Moe]]'s 32-stanza reconstructed text (1920).&lt;ref&gt;Liestøl, Moe edd. (1920) ''Norske Folkevisor'', Kristiania, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; A full translation is given in Heidi Støa's paper (2008).&lt;ref name="stoa-trans"&gt;{{Harvnb|Støa|2008|pp=85–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; It resembles the 22-stanza text printed by [[Svend Grundtvig|Gruntvig]] (as a Norwegian variant to [[Danmarks gamle Folkeviser|DgF]] 40c).&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Provided to Grundtvig by [[Sophus Bugge]], transcribed by Hans Ross of Fyresdal, Telemark, in 1874.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dgf40-tillaeg"&gt;{{Harvnb|Grundtvig|Olrik|1883|loc=Vol. 4, Tillæg til Nr. 40, pp.815-}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hans-ross-varr"&gt;[http://www.dokpro.uio.no/ballader/tekster_html/a/a050_036.html Variant 16] Hans Ross's 1874 ms.

===Norwegian summary===
The Liestøl/Moe ballad begins as follows (the recurring "burden"&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Variants have different burdens altogether, and some employ a sort of double burden or a "inner refrain" (Cf. §[[#Burden|Burden]] below).&lt;/ref&gt; is italicized):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|cellpadding="5"
|- valign="top"
|
&lt;poem&gt;
1. Villemann og hass møy så prud, 
dei leika gulltavl i hennar bur. 
''Så liflig leika Villemann for si skjønn jomfru''&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
1. Villemann and his maid so fair
played [[tafl game]] of gold in her bower.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;"played at [[draughts]]" tr. Espeland;  "game of golden pieces" tr. Støa&lt;/ref&gt; 
''So delightfully Villemann played for his maiden fair.''&lt;/poem&gt;
{{right|&amp;mdash;Adapted from Støa's tr.,&lt;ref name="stoa-trans"/&gt; Espeland tr.&lt;ref name="espelland-maide007"/&gt;}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Villemann perceives that his beloved Magnill is weeping as the dice is cast while playing the board game (stanza 2).  He makes a series of guesses why she is crying: ""Cry you for fields, or cry you for meadows..etc.," and she replies she cries for none of these things (3 ~ 6).  She cries because she knows she is destined for imminent death:  her fair skin lying in the "darkling mould" (earth), her yellow hair rotting in "Vendel's river," having fallen from the "Blide bridge" like her sisters (7 ~ 9).

The remainder follows the typical pan-Scandinavian pattern, except for a final conclusion. Thus the hero's promise to fortify bridge with pillars of lead and steel, and men riding alongside her, her protest of futility (10 ~ 15), her horse (shod with horseshoes and nails of red gold) rearing up on hind legs, her fall into the river (16 ~ 18),{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|Støa renders "red golden seams",&lt;ref name="stoa-trans"/&gt; but "nails" for fastening the horseshoes is called for here. Nynorsk: ''saum (2)'' "(større) spikar; nagle til å feste..," etc., corrected from "golden seams"}} Villemann's playing golden harp from golden case, his playing mounts with ever more wondrous effects on nature (19 ~ 26). Finally the ''nykkjen'' ([[Neck (water spirit)|nøkken]]) releases one, then two (of her arms?), and pleads to bring stillness to his waters. But the hero refuses, and "the shatters against the hard stone" (''nykkjen han sprakk i hardan stein'').{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|Støa renders as "nøkken he turned to hardened stone," but ''sprakk'', preterite case of verb ''[[wikt:sprekke|sprekke]]'' is recorded elsewhere and applied to tree barks shattering by the playing of the harp.&lt;ref name="stoa-trans"/&gt;}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Norwegian burdens===
The Liestøl/Moe text "''Villeman og Magnill''" features only the one burden "''Så liflig leika Villemann for si skjønn jomfru'' (So delightfully Villemann played for his virgin so fair&lt;ref name="stoa-trans"/&gt;)", which is echoed by e.g. the Hans Ross versions,.&lt;ref name="hans-ross-varr"/&gt; Other variants have a single burden though worded differently.

However, Espland likes to class "Villemann og Magnhild" as a type that features "interior refrain" and a "final burden" (in italics below):&lt;ref name="espelland-maide007"&gt;{{Harvnb|Espeland|2004|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
|- valign="top"
|
&lt;poem&gt;
Villemann og hass møy så prud, 
''hei fagraste lindelauvi alle, ''
dei leika gulltavel i hennar bur. 
''Ved de rone det lyst å vinne''.&lt;/poem&gt;
|
&lt;poem&gt;
Villemann and his maid so fair, 
''Hey, all the leaves of the sweet linden tree,'' 
They played at draughts in her bower there.
''With the wiles ["rune"] that the winning beguiled.''&lt;/poem&gt;
{{right|&amp;mdash;Espeland tr.&lt;ref name="espelland-maide007"/&gt;}}
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The "interior refrain" and "burden" are repeated in the second and last lines of each quatrain stanza, a common formula found in other ballads.&lt;ref name="espelland-maide007"/&gt; They precisely match the refrains performed by Høye Strand (1891-1972), recorded by {{Interlanguage link multi|Rolf Myklebust|2=no|preserve=1}}.&lt;ref name="var061"/&gt; Strand had learned from the ballad-singing tradition of singers who once performed for [[Jørgen Moe]] and [[Sophus Bugge]].&lt;ref name="30balladen-085"/&gt; Here the ''de rone'' or ''rune'' is construed as "the spell",&lt;ref name="30balladen-085"/&gt; or "the wiles".&lt;ref name="espelland-maide007"/&gt; Earlier transcribers heard these words as "''dragonerne''" (meaning "[[dragoon]]" or "firearm-bearing type of soldier"),{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|"dragonerne" in Myklebust's 1938 ms.&lt;ref name="var059"/&gt; and in O. M. Sandvik's 1938 manuscript (NB Mus ms a 2124:1053;  BIN: 3783)&lt;ref&gt;Visearkivet's pdf: [http://www.visearkivet.no/pdf_filer/norske_ballader/1_6_Villlemann_og_Magnhild.pdf 1.6 Villemann og Magnhild]&lt;/ref&gt;}} and the contention has been made that this may have been the transmitted form, nonsensical as it appears to be.&lt;ref name="30balladen-085"/&gt; Still, the exact refrains including the use of "rune" are attested elsewhere in much earlier documents, e.g. Bugge's ms. of 1867&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dokpro.uio.no/ballader/tekster_html/a/a050_029_fnote.html#sluttnote Variant 29] Sophus Bugge's 1867 ms. [BIN: 0529]. [[Norsk Folkeminnelag|Norwegian Folklore Society]] collection, ms. NFS S. Bugge c, 220&lt;/ref&gt; and others.&lt;ref name="var017"&gt;[http://www.dokpro.uio.no/ballader/tekster_html/a/a050_055.html Variant 17] Kjetil A. Flatin's ms. of 1914 [BIN: 0555]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norwegian variations===
The scene of ''tavl'' (board game) being played by the two is not omnipresent in all versions. Instead, the playing of the ''gullharp'' by the hero occurs in the version performed by Strand and recorded by Myklebust.&lt;ref name="var061"&gt;[http://www.dokpro.uio.no/ballader/tekster_html/a/a050_095.html Variant 61], Rolf Myklebust 's 1965 ms. (BIN: 0595)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="30balladen-085"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nork visearkiv|2011|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="var059"&gt;[http://www.dokpro.uio.no/ballader/tekster_html/a/a050_094.html Variant 59], Rolf Myklebust 's 1938 ms. (BIN: 0594)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Other variants just mention "playing", or nothing corresponding at all.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some variants, the ''gull'' element is seen in the hero's altered name: Gullmund, Guldmund, Gudmund, etc. The hero could be called Gaute also (which is close to the name of the hero in the Icelandic version). And Villemann may be seen under slightly different spellings: Villemand, Vellemand, Vilemann, even Wallemann.&lt;ref name="hans-ross-varr"/&gt;

The name "Vendel's river" ("Vendels å") occurs in Liestøl and Moe's version as well as the Gruntvig text, but may be replaced by other river names such as "Vendings" in variants.&lt;ref&gt;"Vendings" in the version provided by Bugge, printed as variant to DgF 40C in {{Harvnb|Gruntvig|1883|vol.=4, pp.815-}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Vendings" in Landstad's No. 51 "Gaute og Magnild"&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|"Vendelins å" occurs in several variants also; and "Vandals å" in,&lt;ref name="var017"/&gt;}} The "Blide bridge" that ironically means "Blithe Bridge" features in Danish versions as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dokpro.uio.no/ballader/tekster_html/a/a050_055.html Variant 33] Rikard Berge's 1913 transcript afterTalleiv Rudi, Fyresdal, Telemark.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|The irony is pointed out with respect to the Danish version, in Graves and Thomsen (2004):&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Graves|Thomsen|2004|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; "a stream ironically named 'Blide' [the Gentle One] in which a troll lives - must be crossed via 'Blide-Bro' [Gentle Bridge] by the unnamed female protagonist on her way."}}

==Icelandic==
The analogue in Iceland is known as ''Gautakvæði'' "Gauti's ballad", for which Grundtvig and Sigurðsson printed a critical text based on variants A&amp;ndash;D (''Íslenzk fornkvæði'' no. 3).&lt;ref name="Isfk"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gruntvig|Sigurðsson|1858|loc=''Íslensk fornkvæði'', No. 3, pp.15-}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hallmundsson"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hallmundsson|1962|pp=267–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vesteinn"&gt;{{Harvnb|Vésteinn Ólason|1982|pp=126&amp;ndash;7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Icelandic version, the main characters are Gauti, a fine knight, and his wife Magnhild, wearing much gold jewelry and clad in black dress.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;According to the Cleasby-Vigfusson dictionary, "BRÚNN, adj." is literally "brown", but "''brún klæði'', black dress, of the dress of a divine".&lt;/ref&gt; While they lie in bed together, he asks her, "What grieves thee, my sweetheart?" and she answers it is because she will inevitably will be drowned in Skotberg River. He assures her she will not be drowned because he will build an iron bridge over the river. She replies "Though thou make it as high as a cloud, none can flee one's fate (tr. Kemp in his summary&lt;ref name="hallmundsson"/&gt;)" (str. 1&amp;ndash;4). After three days of drunken revelry, they ride out to the Skotberg's river (str. 6),&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Variant D here inserts three stanzas, where Gauti orders his swain to saddle his pale (''blakkr'') and brown horse so they can ride to the priest's house.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gauti asks his swain (youth) about what has happened to Magnild, and receives report that just as she reached the midpoint, the iron bridge broke into pieces. 50 men fell in, and no one was paying attention about Magnhild (str. 10). He tells his swain to fetch his harp, and hurls the harp against the floor, breaking twelve strings, and then five more (str. 13).&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;The harp-hurling and string-breaking stanzas are found in other ballads, e.g. Vallara kvæði (''Íslenzk fornkvæði'' no. 15)&lt;/ref&gt; He [[wikt:strum|strums]] the first tune, and a star is shot into the murky sea. His playing coaxes a bolt out of its lock, a cow from its shed, horse from its stall, a fair hind from the mountain, a ship from the rollers for launching it (''hlunnr''), a fair maiden from the greenfield, and finally, wrenches his wife Magnhild onto the white sand upon land (str. 18).{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|Vesteinn Ólason gives "he draws a star into the sea, a bolt from a lock, a cow from its stall, hind from the hillside and, finally, Magnhild from the deep."&lt;ref name="vesteinn"/&gt; In ''stjarnan fauk'' (str. 14),''fauk'' is preterite of verb FJÚKA "to be driven on, tossed by the wind, of snow, dust, spray, or the like"; "kú af bási'' (str. 15), ''bási'' is dative of BÁSS "a boose or stall in a cowhouse" (Cleasby-Vigfusson)}} She is dead, and with much pain he kisses her, buries her flesh in consecrated ground, and takes strands of her gleaming hair to make into harp strings (str. 19&amp;ndash;21).&lt;ref name="hallmundsson"/&gt; Variant B has an alternate ending, where he kisses her corpse and his heart bursts. In variant D, he kisses her and his heart shatters into three pieces, and three bodies went inside the stone-coffin together: Gauti and his wife and his mother who died of grief.{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|Hallmundsson states "According to other versions of the ballad, Gauti's heart burst when he kissed his wife, and the two were buried in the same grave."&lt;ref name="hallmundsson"/&gt; and Vesteinn Ólason "But he has to endure the pain of kissing her dead lips. Thus ends B; DE add that his heart broke and describe the funeral."&lt;ref name="vesteinn"/&gt; However, in Gruntvig ed., ''Íslensk fornkvæði'' the D variant's conclusion state ''þrjú fóru lík í steinþró saman'' (three bodies went inside the stone-coffin together), and ''hans hjartað brast'' in the B variant also. }}

The name of the river in the ballad, "Skotberg River" (''Skotbergs á''), cannot be identified in Iceland's landscape but bears similarity to Skodborg River bordering North and [[South Jutland County|South Jutland]] in Denmark, though none of the Danish ballad cognates give that river's name.&lt;ref name="Isfk"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1918">The '''Indian Ocean Whale Sanctuary''' is an area in the [[Indian Ocean]] where the [[International Whaling Commission]] (IWC) has banned all types of commercial whaling. The IWC has at present designated two such sanctuaries, the other being the [[Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary]]. Repeated proposals at the IWC for a South Atlantic Sanctuary and a South Pacific Sanctuary have never reached the 75% majority needed to pass.

==History==
The Indian Ocean Sanctuary was established by the IWC in 1979 after being proposed by the tiny island nation of the [[Seychelles]], in its first meeting as an IWC member, partly in order to protect whales in their breeding grounds.

The status of the Whale Sanctuaries is reviewed by the IWC every 10 years, and the Indian Ocean Sanctuary has so far been reviewed (and extended) three times, in 1989, 1992 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/species/cetaceans/whale-protection/sanctuaries.html Whale sanctuaries&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080710071734/http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/species/cetaceans/whale-protection/sanctuaries.html |date=2008-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Area==
The Indian Ocean Whale Sanctuary extends south to 55°S latitude with a western boundary of 20°E longitude by Africa and an eastern boundary of 130°E longitude by Australia. To the south it borders the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.

The '''La Costa xeric shrublands''' (NT1309) is an ecoregion in Venezuela that stretches along the [[Caribbean]] coast.
The dry scrub and savanna has been subject to modification since the 16th century by European colonists who replaced it by a patchwork of farm fields and pasturage. 
Little of the original habitat remains.

==Geography==

===Location===
{{location map|Venezuela|relief=yes|lat_deg=9.386 |lon_deg=-65.944 |caption=Location in Venezuela|width=220px}}
The La Costa xeric shrublands ecoregion extends along Venezuela's Caribbean coast, covering plains, hills and isolated mountains.
[[Caracas]], the capital of Venezuela, lies partly in this ecoregion.{{sfn|La Costa xeric shrublands – Myers|loc=WWF Abstract}}
It reaches from [[Sucre (state)|Sucre]] state in the east to [[Yaracuy]] state in the west.{{sfn|Locklin}}
The ecoregion includes areas of savanna, dry forest, moist forest, swamp and scrub.
It has an area of {{convert|6,837,568|ha}}.{{sfn|La Costa xeric shrublands – Myers|loc=WWF Abstract}}

In the west the shrubland transitions into the [[Lara-Falcón dry forests]] ecoregion.
The extreme west of the La Costa xeric shrublands merges into the [[Paraguana xeric scrub]] just east of [[Barquisimeto]].
To the south the La Costa xeric shrublands transitions into the [[Los Llanos (South America)|Llanos]]. 
There are regions of [[Cordillera de la Costa montane forests]] along the Caribbean coastline. 
The coastal area in the east of the region is covered by [[Araya and Paria xeric scrub]].
In the extreme east the ecoregion transitions into [[Orinoco Delta swamp forests]].{{sfn|WildFinder – WWF}}

===Terrain===

The xeric shrublands are in the Coastal Cordillera geographical region.
The shrublands, which blend into the Llanos grasslands to the south, surround the mountains of the [[Venezuelan Coastal Range]].
Elevations rise from sea level to {{convert|1000|m}} in the upper foothills of the mountains.
Along the coast there are sandy beaches, mangroves, lagoons and hilly patches of moist forest.{{sfn|Locklin}}

===Climate===

Average annual temperature is around {{convert|20|C}}.
Annual rainfall is {{convert|300-1000|mm}}.{{sfn|Locklin}}
At a sample location at coordinates {{coord|9.75 | -66.25}} the [[Köppen climate classification]] is "Aw": equatorial, winter dry.{{sfn|La Costa xeric shrublands – Myers|loc=Climate Data}}
At this location the mean temperature varies from {{convert|24.5|C}} in July to {{convert|26.5|C}} in April.
Total yearly rainfall is about {{convert|1400|mm}}.
Monthly rainfall varies from {{convert|12.5|mm}} in March to {{convert|233.1|mm}} in July.{{sfn|La Costa xeric shrublands – Myers|loc=Climate Data}}

There is a large human population that dates back to 16th century colonists from Europe.
Most of the natural habitat has been destroyed, particularly in the lower areas, replaced by a patchwork of towns, farm fields and pastures.
A few areas of natural savanna and thorn forest remain.
The [[El Ávila National Park]] and [[San Esteban National Park]] hold small areas of xeric shrubland.{{sfn|Locklin}}
Other protected areas include the [[Mochima National Park]] and the [[Henri Pittier National Park]].{{sfn|La Costa xeric shrublands – Myers|loc=WWF Abstract}}

'''Lacus Solitudinis''' ([[Latin]] for "Lake of Solitude") is a small [[lunar mare]] on the [[Far side (Moon)|far side]] of the [[Moon]]. The selenographic [[coordinate]]s of the lake are 27.8° S, 104.3° E, and it lies within a diameter of 139&amp;nbsp;km. It forms an arcing feature with the [[wiktionary:Concave|concave]] side oriented to the northwest. The eastern edge is relatively continuous, while the west is more irregular and disrupted by small craters.

To the northwest of the northern end is the small crater [[Bowditch (crater)|Bowditch]], a [[lava]]-flooded feature although it does not appear directly connected to the Lacus Solitudinis. At the western end of the mare, the eroded crater [[Titius (crater)|Titius]] lies to the northwest. To the south of this feature is Parkhurst&amp;nbsp;Y, with [[Parkhurst (crater)|Parkhurst]] itself lying some distance to the southeast.

This is an incomplete '''list of rivers''' that are at least partially in [[Spain]]. The rivers are grouped by sea or ocean. The rivers flowing into the sea are sorted along the coast. Rivers flowing into other rivers are listed by the rivers they flow into. The rivers that have their mouths in Portugal are given in italics.

The list begins in [[Catalonia]] at the French border and moves clockwise around the [[Iberian Peninsula]].

'''Loco''' (also spelled Loko) is a [[loa]], patron of healers and [[plant]]s, especially [[tree]]s in the [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] religion.  He is a racine (root), and a [[rada loa]]. Among several other Loa he is linked with the poteau mitan or centrepost in a Vodou peristyle. 

He is the husband of loa [[Ayizan]], and just as she is the archetypal Mambo (priestess), so her husband Loco  is considered the first Houngan (priest). As the spiritual parents of the priesthood he and his wife are two of the Loa involved in the kanzo initiation rites in which the Priest/ess to be is given the asson (sacred rattle and tool of the priesthood), and are both powerful guardians of "reglemen," or the correct and appropriate form of Vodoun service. 

This loa is also known by the Haitians Arawak ancestors. He is similar to the [[Arawak]] Deity Louquo, a founding ancestor of the Arawak people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7886">The '''Lower Mississippi water resource region''' is one of 21 major geographic areas, or [[Water resource region|regions]], in the first level of classification used by the [[United States Geological Survey]] to divide and sub-divide the [[United States]] into successively smaller [[hydrologic unit]]s. These geographic areas contain either the drainage area of a major river, or the combined drainage areas of a series of rivers.&lt;ref name=USGS_WS&gt;{{cite web|title=Science in Your Watershed - Locate Your Watershed|url=http://water.usgs.gov/wsc/watershed_finder.html|publisher=[[USGS]]|accessdate=2016-10-12}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USGS_HUC&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydrologic Unit Maps|url=http://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html|publisher=[[USGS]]|accessdate=2016-10-12}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lower Mississippi region, which is listed with a 2-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) of 08, has an approximate size of {{convert|106,741|sqmi|km2|abbr=off|lk=on|sp=us}}, and consists of 9 subregions, which are listed with the 4-digit HUCs 0801 through 0809.

This region includes the drainage within the United States of: (a) the [[Mississippi River]] below its confluence with the [[Ohio River]], excluding the [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]], [[Red River of the South|Red]], and [[White River (Arkansas–Missouri)|White River]] basins above the points of highest backwater effect of the Mississippi River in those basins; and (b) coastal streams that ultimately discharge into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] from the [[Pearl River (Mississippi–Louisiana)|Pearl River]] Basin boundary to the [[Sabine River (Texas–Louisiana)|Sabine River]] and [[Sabine Lake]] drainage boundary. Includes parts of [[Arkansas]], [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Missouri]], and [[Tennessee]].&lt;ref name=USGS_HUC_name&gt;{{cite web|title=Boundary Descriptions and Names of Regions, Subregions, Accounting Units and Cataloging Units|url=https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc_name.html|publisher=[[USGS]]|accessdate=2016-10-12}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mount Honaz''' ({{lang-tr|Honaz Dağı}}), is a mountain and a [[national park]], located in southwestern [[Turkey]], {{convert|17|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the province seat of [[Denizli]]. On April 21, 1995, it was proclaimed as a [[protected area]]. [[Honaz]], Denizli's depending township that carries the same name as the mountain, is situated on the mountain slopes. At {{convert|2571|m|ft|abbr=on}}, it is the highest mountain in Turkey's [[Aegean Region, Turkey|Aegean Region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.honaz.gov.tr/millipark.asp |publisher=Honaz Kaymakamlığı |title=Milli Park |language=Turkish |accessdate=2010-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mountain is covered with forests, which are particularly dense in its northern side. Ice and snow are omnipresent around its summit. There has been a project for establishing a [[ski resort]] on the mountain a few years ago when the province's marking governor, the late Recep Yazıcıoğlu was in office. However, these plans lie idle for the moment despite the suitable conditions the mountain offers for [[winter sports]].

{{Main article|Arctic}}
The '''North American Arctic''' comprises the northern portions of [[Alaska]] (USA), [[Northern Canada]] and [[Greenland]]. Major bodies of water include the [[Arctic Ocean]], [[Hudson Bay]], the [[Gulf of Alaska]] and North Atlantic Ocean. The western limit is the [[Seward Peninsula]] and the [[Bering Strait]]. The southern limit is the [[Arctic Circle]] latitude of 66° 33’N, which is the approximate limit of the [[midnight sun]] and the [[polar night]].

The [[Arctic]] region is defined by environmental limits where the average temperature for the warmest month (July) is below {{convert|10|C}}. The northernmost [[tree line]] roughly follows the isotherm at the boundary of this region. The area has [[tundra]] and [[Polar regions of Earth|polar]] [[Arctic vegetation|vegetation]].

The '''Office of Gas and Electricity Markets''' ('''Ofgem'''), supporting the '''Gas and Electricity Markets Authority''' ('''GEMA'''), is the [[government regulation|government regulator]] for the [[electricity]] and [[downstream (petroleum industry)|downstream]] [[natural gas]] markets in [[Great Britain]]. It was formed by the merger of the '''Office of Electricity Regulation''' ('''OFFER''') and '''Office of Gas Supply''' ('''Ofgas''').

==Powers and duties==
The authority's powers and duties are largely provided for in statute (such as the [[Gas Act 1986]], the [[Electricity Act 1989]], the [[Utilities Act 2000]], the [[Competition Act 1998]], the [[Enterprise Act 2002]] and the [[Energy Act 2004]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=energy&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=3302159&amp;ActiveTextDocId=3302159&amp;filesize=9649 |title=The UK Statute Law Database: The Energy Act 2004 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Energy Act 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/legResults.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=energy&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;activeTextDocId=3540328&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;SortAlpha=0 |title=The UK Statute Law Database: The Energy Act 2008 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date=27 May 2011 |accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Energy Act 2010]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/legResults.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=energy+act+2010&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;activeTextDocId=3697973&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;SortAlpha=0 |title=The UK Statute Law Database: The Energy Act 2010 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as well as arising from directly effective European Union legislation. Duties and functions concerning gas are set out in the Gas Act and those relating to electricity are set out in the Electricity Act.

Its primary duty is to protect the interests of consumers, where possible by promoting competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file32549.pdf|title=The role of energywatch and Ofgem|page=2|format=PDF|date=|accessdate=13 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908123954/http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file32549.pdf|archivedate=8 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Authority‘s main objective is to protect existing and future consumers' interests in relation to gas conveyed through pipes and electricity conveyed by distribution or transmission systems. Consumers' interests are their interests taken as a whole, including their interests in the reduction of greenhouse gases and in the security of the supply of gas and electricity to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Markets/RetMkts/ensuppro/Documents1/Electricity%20and%20Gas%20Supply%20Market%20Report%20September%202010.pdf |title=Ofgem Electricity and Gas Supply Market Report September 2010| pages=19–21 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010 the Authority has imposed nearly £100&amp;nbsp;million in fines and [[redress levy|redress levies]] against energy suppliers, including a £12&amp;nbsp;million redress levy on [[E.ON]] in May 2014,&lt;ref name="OfgemPenalty"&gt;{{cite news|title=E.On to reimburse 12mn pounds to customers for mis-selling power|url=http://www.theuknews.com/index.php/sid/222063701/scat/0f440bf3fff89f01/ht/EOn-to-reimburse-12mn-pounds-to-customers-for-mis-selling-power|accessdate=17 May 2014|publisher=''The UK News''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a £1 million redress levy on [[British Gas]] in July 2014.&lt;ref name="BritishGas"&gt;{{cite news|title=BG pays compensation for mis-sold contracts|url=http://www.britainnews.net/index.php/sid/223524977/scat/3a8a80d6f705f8cc/ht/BG-pays-compensation-for-mis-sold-contracts|accessdate=5 July 2014|publisher=''Britain News.Net''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The Gas and Electricity Markets Authority is governed by the Chairman David Gray, executive members as well as non-executive members.&lt;ref name="ofgem1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/about-us/who-we-are/gas-and-electricity-markets-authority |title=Gas and Electricity Markets Authority |format=webpage |date= |accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dermot Nolan was appointed Chief Executive of Ofgem in 2014.&lt;ref name="ofgem1"/&gt;

Ofgem is divided into Ofgem (Smarter Grids &amp; Governance, Markets, Sustainable Development and Group Finance Director) and Ofgem E-Serve containing Group Functions: Environmental Programmes, Operations/HR, Information Management and Technology, Finance and Risk Management, and Commercial: Offshore, Legal, Smart Metering Delivery, New Schemes Development.&lt;ref name="ofgem1"/&gt;

==Development of competition in the UK market==
The liberalisation and [[privatisation]] of the energy markets in the United Kingdom began with the [[Margaret Thatcher]] Government in the 1980s (often called the Thatcher-Lawson agenda, due to the key role of [[Nigel Lawson]] in the Thatcher government cabinet). Aspects of the Ofgem model have been adopted by [[European Union|EU]] legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/energy/gas_electricity/index_en.htm |title=Energy: What do we want to achieve? - European Commission |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1990s, the supply of electricity and gas to end consumers in the UK has been unbundled from the rest of the industry. At the time of privatisation, British Gas and one regional [[public electricity supplier]] (PES) held a [[monopoly]] on supplying all domestic gas and electricity consumers respectively in Great Britain. Between 1996 and 1999, domestic energy consumers gradually had to choose their supplier, and finally in May 1998, the domestic gas market was fully opened to competition, closely followed by the domestic [[electricity market]] in May 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Markets/RetMkts/ensuppro/Documents1/Energy%20Supply%20Probe%20-%20Initial%20Findings%20Report.pdf |title=Energy Supply Probe - Initial Findings Report| pages=18–20 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before there was competition on domestic markets, Ofgem set [[price controls]] fixing maximum price that the monopoly suppliers could charge domestic customers. These price controls remained in place when markets started to get liberalised, and were then gradually removed between 2000 and 2002. Ofgem’s decision to remove price controls was based on the assessment that competition was developing well at that time and that the [[Competition Act 1998]], being effective since March 2000, would deter companies from the abuse of market power, and provide Ofgem with sufficient power to tackle any abuse. Moreover, consumer surveys showed good awareness of the ability to switch, high and rising switching rates away from the former monopoly supplies, and substantial and continuing falls in their market shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Markets/RetMkts/ensuppro/Documents1/Energy%20Supply%20Probe%20-%20Initial%20Findings%20Report.pdf |title=Energy Supply Probe - Initial Findings Report| page=20 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the Social Action Strategy review group was established and the Competition Act came into force. In 2003 the Wholesale Gas Probe was published. Two years after the removal of the last price controls, in April 2004, Ofgem published a major review of the state of competition in the domestic energy supply markets, concluding that supply competition had delivered substantial benefits for all consumers and that the markets were competitive, though not yet mature. In 2005 there was the EU Energy Sector Enquiry, as well as the Supply Licence Review. The Energy Supply Ombudsman was then established in 2006 and in 2008 the Energy Supply Probe was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Markets/RetMkts/ensuppro/Documents1/Energy%20Supply%20Probe%20-%20Initial%20Findings%20Report.pdf |title=Energy Supply Probe - Initial Findings Report| pages=20–21 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Against the background of unprecedented increases in world [[price of petroleum|fuel prices]] leading to record increases in wholesale and retail gas and electricity prices so that a typical household's energy bills more than doubled since early 2004 Ofgem undertook the Energy Supply Probe. The numbers of consumers in debt to their energy suppliers, average debt levels and disconnection rates were all rising. These energy price rises came at a time when household budgets were under pressure from the rising cost of food, petrol, mortgages and other essentials. Vulnerable consumers and those in fuel poverty were particularly affected. The Energy Supply Probe published the findings on the operation of the UK retail energy markets and set out a package of measures to tackle the issues raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Markets/RetMkts/ensuppro/Documents1/Energy%20Supply%20Probe%20-%20Initial%20Findings%20Report.pdf |title=Energy Supply Probe&amp;nbsp;— Initial Findings Report| pages=22–27 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CMA investigation===
In June 2014 Ofgem announced a [[Competition and Markets Authority]] (CMA) investigation into the trading practices and competitiveness of the country's major energy companies: [[Centrica]], [[SSE plc]], [[RWE npower]], [[E.ON]], [[Scottish Power]] and [[EDF Energy]]. The investigation, which took two years, followed a referral by Ofgem to the competition regulator. "There is near-unanimous support for a referral and the CMA investigation offers an important opportunity to clear the air. This will help rebuild consumer trust and confidence in the energy market as well as provide the certainty investors have called for," Ofgem CEO Dermot Nolan in announcing the investigation.&lt;ref name="CMAprobe"&gt;{{cite news|title=UK market regulator to probe power utilities' operations|url=http://www.theuknews.com/index.php/sid/223293197/scat/0f440bf3fff89f01/ht/UK-market-regulator-to-probe-power-utilities-operations|accessdate=27 June 2014|publisher=The UK News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016 Ofgem said that it would implement the CMA's recommendation that suppliers should be required to provide the details of customers who have been on expensive tariffs for three years or more to rival suppliers. Ofgem also said that it would impose an interim price cap on customers using pre-payment meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Financial Times|author=Mehreen Khan|title=Ofgem approves plans to reduce energy bills|url=https://next.ft.com/content/c16cd3a2-02ba-383e-9237-df66879fcdfc|date=3 August 2016|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of abuse of power relating to whistleblowers==
In September 2018, the Guardian published a report claiming that two OFGEm experts had been independently threatened with criminal sanctions if they publicly revealed information. OFGEM allegedly invoked section 105 of the [[Utilities Act 2000]], designed to protect national security, relating to concerns about energy meters and renewable heat incentive projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/sep/17/ofgem-made-my-life-hell-whistleblowers-say-they-were-threatened-by-regulator|title=Ofgem exploited national security law to silence us, whistleblowers claim|work=Guardian newspapers|author=Nick Hopkins|date=17 Sep 2018|accessdate=17 Sep 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biology]], an '''organism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ὀργανισμός, ''organismos'') is any individual [[entity]] that exhibits the [[Life#Biology|properties of life]]. It is a synonym for "[[Outline of life forms|life form]]".

Organisms are classified by [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] into specified groups such as the [[Multicellular organism|multicellular]] [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, and [[fungi]]; or [[Unicellular organism|unicellular]] [[microorganism]]s such as a [[protist]]s, [[bacteria]], and [[archaea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hine|first1=RS.|title=A dictionary of biology|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-920462-5|page=461|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; All types of organisms are capable of [[reproduction]], [[Developmental biology|growth and development]], [[homeostasis|maintenance]], and some degree of response to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]. [[Human]]s are multicellular animals composed of many trillions of cells which [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] during [[developmental biology|development]] into specialized [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] and [[organ (anatomy)|organs]].

An organism may be either a [[prokaryote]] or a [[eukaryote]]. Prokaryotes are represented by two separate [[Three-domain system|domains]]—[[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. Eukaryotic organisms are characterized by the presence of a membrane-bound [[cell nucleus]] and contain additional membrane-bound compartments called [[organelle]]s (such as [[mitochondria]] in animals and plants and [[plastid]]s in plants and [[algae]], all generally considered to be derived from [[symbiogenesis|endosymbiotic]] bacteria).&lt;ref name=cavaliersmith1987&gt;{{cite journal| author = Cavalier-Smith T.| year = 1987| title = The origin of eukaryotic and archaebacterial cells| journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences| volume = 503| issue =| pages = 17–54| pmid = 3113314| doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb40596.x| bibcode = 1987NYASA.503...17C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fungi, animals and plants are examples of [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] of organisms within the eukaryotes.

==Etymology==
The term "organism" (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ὀργανισμός, ''organismos'', from ὄργανον, ''organon'', i.e. "instrument, implement, tool, organ of sense or apprehension"&lt;ref name=LSJ&gt;{{LSJ|o)/rganon|ὄργανον|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web|title=organism|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=organism&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) first appeared in the English language in 1703 and took on its current definition by 1834 ([[Oxford English Dictionary]]). It is directly related to the term "organization". There is a long tradition of defining organisms as self-organizing beings, going back at least to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s 1790 ''[[Critique of Judgment]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kant I., [[Critique of Judgment]]: §64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
An organism may be defined as an assembly of [[molecule]]s functioning as a more or less stable whole that exhibits the [[Life#Biology|properties of life]]. Dictionary definitions can be broad, using phrases such as "any living structure, such as a plant, animal, fungus or bacterium, capable of growth and reproduction".&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Chambers 21st Century Dictionary |edition=online |date=1999 |title=organism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many definitions exclude [[virus]]es and possible man-made [[Hypothetical types of biochemistry|non-organic life]] forms, as viruses are dependent on the biochemical machinery of a host cell for reproduction.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{Cite OED|organism|date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[superorganism]] is an organism consisting of many individuals working together as a single functional or [[social unit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kelly, Kevin |title=Out of control: the new biology of machines, social systems and the economic world |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=1994 |pages=98 |isbn=0-201-48340-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-cellular life===
{{main|Non-cellular life}}
[[Virus]]es are not typically considered to be organisms because they are incapable of autonomous [[reproduction]], growth or [[metabolism]]. This controversy is problematic because some cellular organisms are also incapable of independent survival (but are capable of independent metabolism and procreation) and live as obligatory intracellular parasites. Although viruses have a few [[enzyme]]s and molecules characteristic of living organisms, they have no metabolism of their own; they cannot synthesize and organize the organic compounds from which they are formed. Naturally, this rules out autonomous reproduction: they can only be passively replicated by the machinery of the [[cell (biology)|host cell]]. In this sense, they are similar to inanimate matter. While viruses sustain no independent metabolism, and thus are usually not classified as organisms, they do have their own [[gene]]s, and they do [[evolution|evolve]] by mechanisms similar to the evolutionary mechanisms of organisms.

The most common argument in support of viruses as living organisms is their ability to undergo evolution and replicate through self-assembly. Some scientists argue that viruses neither evolve, nor self- reproduce. In fact, viruses are evolved by their host cells, meaning that there was co-evolution of viruses and host cells. If host cells did not exist, viral evolution would be impossible. This is not true for cells. If viruses did not exist, the direction of cellular evolution could be different, but cells would nevertheless be able to evolve. As for the reproduction, viruses totally rely on hosts' machinery to replicate.&lt;ref name="10reasons" &gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Moreira | first1 = D. | last2 = López-García | first2 = P. N. | title = Ten reasons to exclude viruses from the tree of life | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro2108 | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | year = 2009 | pmid = 19270719| pmc = | volume=7 | issue = 4 | pages=306–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of viral megagenomes with genes coding for energy metabolism and protein synthesis fueled the debate about whether viruses belong in the [[tree of life]]. The presence of these genes suggested that viruses were once able to metabolize. However, it was found later that the genes coding for energy and protein metabolism have a cellular origin. Most likely, these genes were acquired through [[horizontal gene transfer]] from viral hosts.&lt;ref name="10reasons" /&gt;

==Chemistry==
Organisms are complex chemical systems, organized in ways that promote reproduction and some measure of sustainability or survival. The same laws that govern non-living chemistry govern [[Biochemistry|the chemical processes of life]]. It is generally the phenomena of entire organisms that determine their fitness to an environment and therefore the survivability of their [[DNA]]-based genes.

Organisms clearly owe their origin, metabolism, and many other internal functions to chemical phenomena, especially the chemistry of large organic molecules. Organisms are complex systems of [[chemical compound]]s that, through interaction and environment, play a wide variety of roles.

Organisms are semi-closed chemical systems. Although they are individual units of life (as the definition requires), they are not closed to the environment around them. To operate they constantly take in and release energy. [[Autotroph]]s produce usable energy (in the form of organic compounds) using light from the sun or inorganic compounds while [[heterotroph]]s take in organic compounds from the environment.

The primary [[chemical element]] in these compounds is [[carbon]]. The [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] of this element such as its great affinity for bonding with other small atoms, including other carbon atoms, and its small size making it capable of forming multiple bonds, make it ideal as the basis of organic life. It is able to form small three-atom compounds (such as [[carbon dioxide]]), as well as large chains of many thousands of atoms that can store data ([[nucleic acid]]s), hold cells together, and transmit information (protein).

===Macromolecules===
Compounds that make up organisms may be divided into [[macromolecule]]s and other, smaller molecules. The four groups of macromolecule are [[nucleic acid]]s, [[protein]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s and [[lipid]]s. Nucleic acids (specifically deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA) store genetic data as a sequence of [[nucleotide]]s. The particular sequence of the four different types of nucleotides ([[adenine]], [[cytosine]], [[guanine]], and [[thymine]]) dictate many characteristics that constitute the organism. The sequence is divided up into [[codon]]s, each of which is a particular sequence of three nucleotides and corresponds to a particular [[amino acid]]. Thus a sequence of DNA codes for a particular protein that, due to the chemical properties of the amino acids it is made from, [[protein folding|folds]] in a particular manner and so performs a particular function.

These protein functions have been recognized:
# [[Enzyme]]s, which catalyze all of the reactions of metabolism
# Structural proteins, such as [[tubulin]], or [[collagen]]
# Regulatory proteins, such as [[transcription factor]]s or cyclins that regulate the cell cycle
# Signaling molecules or their receptors such as some [[hormone]]s and their receptors
# Defensive proteins, which can include everything from [[Antibody|antibodies]] of the [[immune system]], to toxins (e.g., [[dendrotoxin]]s of snakes), to proteins that include unusual amino acids like [[canavanine]]

A bilayer of [[phospholipid]]s makes up the [[phospholipid membrane|membrane]] of cells that constitutes a barrier, containing everything within the cell and preventing compounds from freely passing into, and out of, the cell. Due to the selective permeability of the phospholipid membrane only specific compounds can pass through it. In some multicellular organisms they serve as a storage of energy and mediate communication between cells. Carbohydrates are more easily broken down than lipids and yield more energy to compare to lipids and proteins. In fact, carbohydrates are the number one source of energy for all living organisms.

==Structure==
All organisms consist of structural units called [[cell (biology)|cells]]; some contain a single cell (unicellular) and others contain many units (multicellular). Multicellular organisms are able to specialize cells to perform specific functions. A group of such cells is a [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], and in animals these occur as four basic types, namely [[epithelium]], [[nervous tissue]], [[muscle tissue]], and [[connective tissue]]. Several types of tissue work together in the form of an [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] to produce a particular function (such as the pumping of the blood by the [[heart]], or as a barrier to the environment as the [[skin]]). This pattern continues to a higher level with several organs functioning as an [[organ system]] such as the [[reproductive system]], and [[digestive system]]. Many multicellular organisms consist of several organ systems, which coordinate to allow for life.

===Cell===
The [[cell theory]], first developed in 1839 by [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann|Schwann]], states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells; all cells come from preexisting cells; and cells contain the [[genetics|hereditary information]] necessary for regulating cell functions and for transmitting information to the next generation of cells.

There are two types of cells, eukaryotic and prokaryotic. Prokaryotic cells are usually singletons, while eukaryotic cells are usually found in multicellular organisms. Prokaryotic cells lack a [[nuclear membrane]] so [[DNA]] is unbound within the cell; eukaryotic cells have nuclear membranes.

All cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic, have a [[cell membrane|membrane]], which envelops the cell, separates its interior from its environment, regulates what moves in and out, and maintains the [[Membrane potential|electric potential of the cell]]. Inside the membrane, a [[salt]]y [[cytoplasm]] takes up most of the cell volume. All cells possess DNA, the hereditary material of [[gene]]s, and [[RNA]], containing the information necessary to [[gene expression|build]] various [[protein]]s such as [[enzyme]]s, the cell's primary machinery. There are also other kinds of [[biomolecule]]s in cells.

All cells share several similar characteristics of:&lt;ref name="AlbertsCh1"&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Search&amp;db=books&amp;doptcmdl=GenBookHL&amp;term=%22all+cells%22+AND+mboc4%5Bbook%5D+AND+372023%5Buid%5D&amp;rid=mboc4.section.4#23 The Universal Features of Cells on Earth] in Chapter 1 of ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Search&amp;db=books&amp;doptcmdl=GenBookHL&amp;term=cell+biology+AND+mboc4%5Bbook%5D+AND+373693%5Buid%5D&amp;rid=mboc4 Molecular Biology of the Cell]'' fourth edition, edited by Bruce Alberts (2002) published by Garland Science.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reproduction by [[cell division]] ([[binary fission]], [[mitosis]] or [[meiosis]]).
* Use of enzymes and other proteins [[genetic code|coded]] by DNA genes and made via [[messenger RNA]] intermediates and [[ribosome]]s.
* Metabolism, including taking in raw materials, building cell components, converting energy, [[molecule]]s and releasing [[by-product]]s. The functioning of a cell depends upon its ability to extract and use chemical energy stored in organic molecules. This energy is derived from [[metabolic pathway]]s.
* Response to external and internal [[signal transduction|stimuli]] such as changes in temperature, [[pH]] or nutrient levels.
* Cell contents are contained within a [[cell membrane|cell surface membrane]] that contains proteins and a [[lipid bilayer]].

Information about the early development of life includes input from many different fields, including [[geology]] and [[planetary science]]. These sciences provide information about the history of the Earth and the changes produced by life. However, a great deal of information about the early Earth has been destroyed by geological processes over the course of [[time]].

All organisms are descended from a common ancestor or ancestral gene pool. Evidence for common descent may be found in traits shared between all living organisms. In Darwin's day, the evidence of shared traits was based solely on visible observation of morphologic similarities, such as the fact that all birds have wings, even those that do not fly.

There is strong evidence from genetics that all organisms have a common ancestor. For example, every living cell makes use of [[nucleic acid]]s as its genetic material, and uses the same twenty [[amino acid]]s as the building blocks for [[protein]]s. All organisms use the same [[genetic code]] (with some extremely rare and minor deviations) to [[translation (genetics)|translate]] nucleic acid sequences into proteins. The universality of these traits strongly suggests common ancestry, because the selection of many of these traits seems arbitrary. [[Horizontal gene transfer]] makes it more difficult to study the last universal ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doolittle |first1=W.

The most commonly accepted location of the root of the [[Tree of life (biology)|tree of life]] is between a [[monophyletic]] [[domain (biology)|domain]] [[Bacteria]] and a [[clade]] formed by [[Archaea]] and [[Eukaryota]] of what is referred to as the "traditional tree of life" based on several molecular studies.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J.

Research published in 2016, by [[William F. Martin]], by genetically analyzing 6.1 million protein coding genes from sequenced prokaryotic genomes of various phylogenetic trees, identified 355 protein clusters from amongst 286,514 protein clusters that were probably common to the LUCA. The results "depict LUCA as [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]], CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fixing, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent with a [[Wood–Ljungdahl pathway]] (the reductive [[Acetyl-CoA|acetyl-coenzyme A]] pathway), N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fixing and thermophilic. LUCA's biochemistry was replete with FeS clusters and radical reaction mechanisms. Its cofactors reveal dependence upon [[transition metals]], [[Flavin mononucleotide|flavins]], [[S-adenosyl methionine]], [[coenzyme A]], [[ferredoxin]], [[molybdopterin]], [[corrin]]s and [[selenium]]. Its genetic code required [[nucleoside]] modifications and S-adenosylmethionine-dependent [[methylation]]s." The results depict [[methanogen]]ic [[clostridium|clostria]] as a basal clade in the 355 lineages examined, and suggest that the LUCA inhabited an anaerobic [[hydrothermal vent]] setting in a geochemically active environment rich in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and iron.&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;"[http://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol2016116 The physiology and habitat of the last universal common ancestor]" by Madeline C.

In prokaryotes, [[Transformation (genetics)#Natural transformation|natural bacterial transformation]] involves the transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another and integration of the donor DNA into the recipient chromosome by recombination. Natural bacterial transformation is considered to be a primitive sexual process and occurs in both bacteria and archaea, although it has been studied mainly in bacteria. Transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation and not an accidental occurrence, because it depends on numerous gene products that specifically interact with each other to enter a state of [[natural competence]] to perform this complex process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chen I |author2=Dubnau D |title=DNA uptake during bacterial transformation |journal=Nat. Rev.

===Horizontal gene transfer===
{{main|Horizontal gene transfer}}
The ancestry of living organisms has traditionally been reconstructed from morphology, but is increasingly supplemented with phylogenetics—the reconstruction of phylogenies by the comparison of genetic (DNA) sequence.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sequence comparisons suggest recent [[horizontal gene transfer|horizontal transfer]] of many genes among diverse [[species]] including across the boundaries of [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] "domains". Thus determining the phylogenetic history of a species can not be done conclusively by determining evolutionary trees for single genes.&lt;ref&gt;Oklahoma State – [https://web.archive.org/web/19990220101406/http://opbs.okstate.edu/%7Emelcher/MG/MGW3/MG334.html Horizontal Gene Transfer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Biologist Peter Gogarten suggests "the original metaphor of a tree no longer fits the data from recent genome research", therefore "biologists (should) use the metaphor of a mosaic to describe the different histories combined in individual genomes and use (the) metaphor of a net to visualize the rich exchange and cooperative effects of HGT among microbes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Gogarten |url=http://www.esalenctr.org/display/confpage.cfm?confid=10&amp;pageid=105&amp;pgtype=1 |title=Horizontal Gene Transfer - A New Paradigm for Biology |publisher=esalenctr.org |accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future of life (cloning and synthetic organisms)===
Modern biotechnology is challenging traditional concepts of organism and species. [[Cloning]] is the process of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another, with the potential of creating entirely new species of organisms. Cloning is the subject of [[ethics of cloning|much ethical debate]].

In 2008, the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]] assembled a synthetic [[Bacterial genome size|bacterial genome]], ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'', by using recombination in yeast of 25 overlapping DNA fragments in a single step. ''The use of yeast recombination greatly simplifies the assembly of large DNA molecules from both synthetic and natural fragments.''&lt;ref name=Venter&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gibsona, Daniel G. |author2=Benders, Gwynedd A. |author3=Axelroda, Kevin C. |display-authors=etal |date=2008 |title=One-step assembly in yeast of 25 overlapping DNA fragments to form a complete synthetic Mycoplasma genitalium genome |journal=PNAS |volume=105 |issue=51 |pages=20404–20409 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/51/20404.full.pdf |doi=10.1073/pnas.0811011106 |pmid=19073939 |pmc=2600582|bibcode=2008PNAS..10520404G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies, such as [[Synthetic Genomics]], have already been formed to take advantage of the many commercial uses of custom designed genomes.

The '''Pleß''' is a mountain, {{Höhe|645.4|DE-NHN|link=true}}, in the county of [[Schmalkalden-Meiningen]] in the Salzungen Werra Highland in the German state of [[Thuringia]].

== Location ==
The Pleß is generally seen as the northeasternmost mountain of the [[Anterior Rhön]],but is counted by the ''Bundesanstalt für Landeskunde'' as part of the adjacent [[natural region]] of the Salzung Werra Upland to the  northeast. The Thurigian State Office for Geology and the Environment (''Thüringer Landesanstalt für Umwelt und Geologie'') sees it as part of the [[Rhön]]. Geologically it was clearly formed as part of the volcanism of the Rhön, but is surrounded by the [[bunter sandstone]] of the Werra Upland.

Among the nearest municipalities are [[Bad Salzungen]] to the north. [[Breitungen/Werra|Breitungen]] to the east-northeast, the nearby [[Rosa (Thuringia)|Rosa]] to the south and [[Urnshausen]] to the southwest. Seen from the [[Thuringian Forest]] which is somewhat further east it is on the left (east-southeast) next to the mountains of [[Baier (Rhön)|Baier]], [[Dietrichsberg (Rhön)|Dietrichsberg]] (Dietrich) and [[Öchsenberg]] (Öchsen).

== Description ==
The Pleß is of [[basalt]]ic volcanic origin.

At the summit of the Pleß is a viewing tower from which the mountains of the [[Thuringian Forest]] and the Rhön, the valley of the [[Werra]] and the castle of [[Wartburg]] can be seen.

== History ==
The original name of the Pleß was the ''Bleßberg''. However, because there were two Bleßbergs in the Duchy of [[Saxe-Meiningen]], an "upland"  [[Bleßberg]] in the vicinity of [[Eisfeld]] and this "lowland" one - which often led to confusion – the name was changed at the behest of [[George II of Saxe-Meiningen|Duke George II]] at the end of the 19th century to Pleßberg. A short time later, the suffix "-berg" was dropped.

As early as the 19th century the Pleßhaus (north of the summit) and a viewing tower were built. In [[East Germany]] the mountain was declared an out-of-bounds area as part of the Bad Salzungen Training Area which extended mainly to the north of the mountain. The Pleßhaus was used as accommodation for the soldiers. Later, a barracks was built on the Pleß, but it stood empty and slowly decayed. Even the viewing tower was demolished.

Keen locals began the preservation of the Pleßhaus. The new Pleßhaus was rebuilt at the Jägerstein. The inn there bears the name ''Seeblick'' today.

Following the gradually withdrawal of the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' during the 1990s, it became possible to walk in the area again. In March 1996 the municipality of Breitungen purchased the area of the Pleßberg and has since had its own ''[[Hausberg]]''. In the wake of that, some time later a new observation tower was built on the Pleß.

'''Pulastya''' ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: पुलस्त्य, [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]]: පුලස්ති, [[Thai language|Thai]]: ท้าวจตุรพักตร์) was one of the ten [[Prajapati]] or mind-born sons of [[Brahma]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m02/m02011.htm|title=''The Mahabharata''|author=[[Kisari Mohan Ganguli]] (1883 - 1896)|publisher=Sacred texts}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the [[Saptarishi]]s (Seven Great Sages [[Rishi]]) in the first [[Manvantara]].&lt;ref name=Tantra&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/tantra/maha/maha00.htm Inhabitants of the Worlds] Mahanirvana Tantra, translated by Arthur Avalon, ([[John Woodroffe|Sir John Woodroffe]]), 1913, Introduction and Preface. The Rishi are seers who know, and by their knowledge are the makers of shastra and "see" all mantras. The word comes from the root rish Rishati-prapnoti sarvvang mantrang jnanena pashyati sangsaraparangva, etc. The seven great Rishi or saptarshi of the first manvantara are '''Marichi, Atri, Angira, Pulaha, Kratu, Pulastya, and Vashishtha'''. In other manvantara there are other ''saptarishi''. In the present manvantara the seven are '''Kashyapa''', ''Atri, Vashishtha, Vishvamitra, Gautama, Jamadagni, Bharadvaja''. To the Rishi the Vedas were revealed. Vyasa taught the Rigveda so revealed to Paila, the Yajurveda to Vaishampayana, the Samaveda to Jaimini, Atharvaveda to Samantu, and Itihasa and Purana to Suta. The three chief classes of rishi are the Brahmarshi, born of the mind of Brahma, the Devarshi of lower rank, and Rajarshi or Kings who became rishi through their knowledge and austerities, such as Janaka, Ritaparna, etc. Thc Shrutarshi are makers of Shastras, as Sushruta. The Kandarshi are of the Karmakanda, such as Jaimini.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical Reference (Purana)==
He was the medium through which some of the [[Puranas]] were communicated to the mankind.{{According to whom|date=January 2016}} He received the Vishnu Purana from Brahma and communicated it to [[Parashara]], who made it known to mankind. 

He was father of [[Vishrava]] Muni who was the father of [[Kubera]] and [[Ravana]], and all the Yaksahas are supposed to have sprung from him. Pulastya was married to one of Rishi Kardam's nine daughters named Havirbhoo. Pulastya Rishi had two sons - [Agastya] and [Vishrava]. Vishrava had two wives: one was [[Kaikesi|Kekasi]] who gave birth to [[Ravana]], [[Shurpanakha]], [[Kumbhakarna]], and [[Vibhishana]]; and another was [[Ilavida]] and had a son named [[Kubera]].

== Archaeology ==
Certain sources claim that the famous granite statue of a king in [[Polonnaruwa]], [[Sri Lanka]], which was first thought to be of King [[Parakramabahu I|Parakramabahu the Great]], might actually be the Pulastya Rishi. This idea was later proven to be false by Prof. Senarath Paranawithana. Apart from this, no other statues, carvings, paintings or friezes of Pulastya Rishi have been found on the island.

'''Sir William Robert Patrick''' "'''Robin'''" '''Knox-Johnston''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|CBE}} &lt;small&gt;[[Decoration for Officers of the Royal Naval Reserve|RD and bar]]&lt;/small&gt; (born 17 March 1939) is a British sailor. In 1969, he became the first person to perform a single-handed non-stop [[circumnavigation]] of the [[globe]] and was the second winner of the [[Jules Verne Trophy]], together with [[Peter Blake (sailor)|Sir Peter Blake]].

For this he was awarded with Blake the [[International Sailing Federation|ISAF]] Yachtsman of the Year award. In 2007, he became, at 67, the oldest yachtsman to complete a round the world solo voyage in the [[VELUX 5 Oceans Race|Velux 5 Oceans Race]].

==Life==

===Early life===
Knox-Johnston was born in [[Putney]] in [[London]] and was educated at the [[Berkhamsted School|Berkhamsted boys' school]]. From 1957 to 1965, he served in the [[British Merchant Navy|Merchant Navy]] and the [[Royal Naval Reserve]]. In 1965, he sailed his William Atkins design ketch ''[[Suhaili]]'' from [[Mumbai|Bombay]] to England. Her design is based on the Norwegian sailing lifeboat designs of [[Colin Archer]].

Due to a lack of money he had to interrupt his voyage for work in South Africa and was only able to complete it in 1967. In 1968, he was one of nine sailors who attempted to achieve the first solo non-stop circumnavigation of the world in the ''[[Sunday Times]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Golden Globe race. He was the third sailor to start the race, and the only one to complete the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robin Knox-Johnston|title=A World of My Own|publisher=Cassell &amp; Co Ltd|year=1969|isbn=0-304-93473-9|oclc=76958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
In 1962 he married Suzanne (Sue), whom he had known from the age of eight; they had one daughter, Sara, who was born in Bombay whilst he was at sea. His wife left him when he proposed taking her and the child back to England in his new boat ''Suhaili'', and they were divorced in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robin Knox Johnston |title=Force of Nature |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1972 they remarried and now have five grandchildren, Florence, Oscar, Xavier, Ralph and Valentine. She died in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.robinknox-johnston.co.uk |title=Sir Robin Knox-Johnston |accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circumnavigation of the Earth==
[[File:GoldenGlobeRaceRoute.png|thumb|300px|The route of the ''Golden Globe Race'']]
On 14 June 1968  Robin Knox-Johnston left [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] in his 32-foot (9.8-metre) boat ''Suhaili'', one of the smallest boats to enter the [[Sunday Times Golden Globe Race]]. Despite losing his self-steering gear off Australia, he rounded [[Cape Horn]] on 17 January 1969, 20 days before his closest competitor [[Bernard Moitessier]]. Moitessier had sailed from Plymouth more than two months after Knox-Johnston, but he subsequently abandoned the race and instead sailed on to Tahiti. The other seven competitors dropped out at various stages, leaving Knox-Johnston to win the race and become officially the first person to circumnavigate the globe non-stop and single-handed on 22 April 1969, the day he returned to Falmouth. Knox-Johnston donated his prize money for fastest competitor, a sum of £5,000, to the family of [[Donald Crowhurst]], who committed suicide after attempting to fake a round the world voyage.

In recognition of his achievement, he was created a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE).

===Further exploits===
In 1970 (with Leslie Williams) and in 1974 (with Gerry Boxall), Knox-Johnston won the two-handed Round Britain Race. Knox-Johnston, Williams and their crew, which included [[Peter Blake (sailor)|Peter Blake]], took [[line honours]] of the 1971 Cape Town to Rio Race. Williams and Knox-Johnston jointly skippered (with Blake a crew member again) maxi yacht [[Condor of Bermuda|Heath's Condor]] in the 1977 [[Whitbread Round the World Race]]. They took the line honours in the second and fourth leg, the ones which Knox-Johnston skippered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knox-Johnston|first1=Robin|title=Races: 1977 - Whitbread|url=https://www.robinknox-johnston.co.uk/races/|website=Robin Knox-Johnston|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knox-Johnston and Blake (who acted as co-skippers) won the [[Jules Verne Trophy]] for the fastest circumnavigation in 1994. Their time was 74 days 22 hours 18 minutes and 22 seconds. It was their second attempt to win this prize after their first one in 1992 had to be aborted when their [[catamaran]] ''Enza'' hit an object which tore a hole in the starboard hull.

From 1992 to 2001, Knox-Johnston was president of the [[Sail Training Association]]. During his tenure the money was collected to replace the STA’s vessels ''Sir Winston Churchill'' and ''Malcolm Miller'' with the new, larger [[brig]]s ''[[Prince William (ship)|Prince William]]'' and ''[[Stavros S Niarchos (ship)|Stavros S. Niarchos]]''. He was trustee of the [[National Maritime Museum]] at [[Greenwich]] from 1992 to 2002 and still is trustee of the National Maritime Museum&amp;nbsp;– [[Cornwall]] at Falmouth, where ''Suhaili'' is berthed today. The yacht has been refitted and took part in the Round the Island Race in June 2005.

He was created a [[knight bachelor]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sir Robin Knox-Johnston |url=http://www.robinknox-johnston.co.uk/da/20074 |title=Sir Robin Knox-Johnston's CV |accessdate=2007-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902100842/http://www.robinknox-johnston.co.uk/da/20074 |archivedate=2 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Knox-Johnston established the first [[Clipper Round the World Yacht Race]] and has since worked with the Clipper Ventures company as chairman to progress the race to higher levels every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sir Robin Knox-Johnston |url=http://www.clipperroundtheworld.com/index.php/the_hatch/sir_robins_blog/ |title=Sir Robin Knox-Johnston's Blog |accessdate=2007-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823000708/http://www.clipperroundtheworld.com/index.php/the_hatch/sir_robins_blog/ |archivedate=23 August 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is perhaps his greatest achievement to have introduced so many people to competitive sailing via their involvement in Clipper Ventures.

He completed his second solo circumnavigation of the world in the yacht ''Saga Insurance ''on 4 May 2007, finishing in fourth place in the [[VELUX 5 Oceans Race|Velux 5 Oceans Race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/6623703.stm |title=Sailing legend crosses the line |publisher=BBC |date=2007-05-04 |accessdate=2007-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 68 he was the oldest competitor in the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=John Elliott |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2168656.html |title=Old man of sea Knox-Johnston takes on world |work=The Sunday Times |date=2006-05-07 |accessdate=2006-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2008 and early 2009, Knox-Johnston took part in a BBC programme called ''Top Dogs: Adventures in War, Sea and Ice''. The programme saw him unite with fellow British legends Sir [[Ranulph Fiennes]], the adventurer, and [[John Simpson (journalist)|John Simpson]], the BBC world affairs editor. The team went on three trips, each experiencing each other's adventure field. The first episode, aired on 27 March 2009, saw Knox-Johnston, Fiennes and Simpson go on a potentially very dangerous news-gathering trip to Afghanistan. The team reported from the legendary [[Khyber Pass]] and infamous [[Tora Bora]] mountain complex. The three also undertook a voyage around [[Cape Horn]] and an expedition hauling sledges across the deep-frozen [[Frobisher Bay]] in the far north of Canada.

Having served two years as president of The [[Cruising Association]], Knox-Johnston is now the association's patron. He is also a past-president of the [[Little Ship Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://littleshipclub.co.uk/ |title=Home |publisher=Little Ship Club |date= |accessdate=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, Knox-Johnston, at age 75, finished the solo transatlantic race the [[Route du Rhum]] in third place in the Rhum class.  He crossed the finish line on his [[IMOCA 60|Open 60]] Grey Power at Pointe à Pitre at 16:52 hours local time/20:52 hours GMT after 20 days, 7 hours, 52 minutes and 22 seconds at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clipperroundtheworld.com/news/article/sir-robin-knoxjohnston-third-in-route-du-rhum--destination-guadeloupe-race-/ |title=Sir Robin Knox-Johnston third in Route du Rhum – Destination Guadeloupe race |website=Clipperroundtheworld.com |date=2014-11-22 |accessdate=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[atmospheric science]], '''surface pressure''' is the [[atmospheric pressure]] at a location on [[Earth]]'s surface.  It is directly proportional to the [[mass]] of air over that location.

For numerical reasons, atmospheric models such as [[general circulation model]]s (GCMs) usually predict the nondimensional ''[[logarithm]] of surface pressure''.

The average value of surface pressure on Earth is 985hPa.&lt;ref name="jacobs"&gt;Jacob, Daniel J. Introduction to Atmospheric Chemistry. Princeton University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to mean sea-level pressure, which involves the extrapolation of pressure to sea-level for locations above or below sea-level. The average pressure at mean sea-level ([[Sea Level|MSL]]) in the International Standard Atmosphere ([[International Standard Atmosphere|ISA]]) is 1013.25hPa, or 1 atmosphere (Atm), or 29.92 inches of mercury. 

Pressure (P), mass (m), and the acceleration due to gravity (g), are related by P = F/A = (m*g)/A, where A is surface area. Atmospheric pressure is thus proportional to the weight per unit area of the atmospheric mass above that location.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3093">The '''Water Communion''' (Water Ritual) is a [[ritual]] service common in [[Unitarian Universalist]] congregations. It is usually held in the fall.

==History==
The first Water Ritual was held at the November 1980 Women and Religion Continental Convocation of Unitarian Universalists in East Lansing, Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn McDade, Lucile Longview, ''Coming Home, Like Rivers to the Sea: A Women's Ritual''. Original booklet published by Pacific Central District W&amp;R, November 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Created by activist [[Carolyn McDade]] and UU leader [[Lucile Schuck Longview]] "as a way for women who lived far apart to connect the work each was doing locally to the whole",&lt;ref&gt;Kimberly French, [http://www.uuworld.org/life/articles/35893.shtml "Carolyn McDade's Spirit of Life"], ''UU World'', Fall 2007&lt;/ref&gt; it has come to be used as an ingathering/homecoming ritual for UU congregations.

==Ritual==
Due to the nature of Unitarian Universalism, traditions vary from one congregation to another; however, most Water Communions follow the same general idea. Throughout the year, members of the congregation collect small amounts of water that have  meaning for them, either from a special location (e.g., the family home, an ocean or river, memento of a trip) or a special occasion (first rain after a dry spell). At the service, the samples of water are placed in a single bowl so they can merge. Some of the water is often saved, sterilized, and then used for ceremonial purposes at other times of the year; the rest is returned to the world.

==Symbolism==
The symbolism, like that of the comparable [[Flower Communion]], can be interpreted in various ways. The classic life-related symbolism of water is apparent. The rejoining of many waters can also symbolize the rejoining of the congregation after summer travels. 

McDade and Longview chose this way to honor the "journeys" of women, and to represent the way women both contribute to and draw from each other's strength, working both individually and together, to bring change.

'''Zari''' (or '''Jari''') is an even thread traditionally made of fine [[gold]] or [[silver]] used in traditional [[India]]n, and [[Pakistan]]i  garments, especially as [[brocade]] in [[sari]]s etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The sari: styles, patterns, history, techniques|author= Linda Lynton|publisher=H.N. Abrams |year=1995|isbn=0-8109-4461-8 |page= |url= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This thread is woven into fabrics, primarily made of [[silk]] to create intricate patterns. It is believed this tradition started during the [[Mughal era]] and the Surat pot being linked to the Haj pilgrims and Indians was a major factor for introducing this craft in India. 
During the Vedic ages, zari was associated with the grand attired of Gods, kings and literary figures. Today, in most fabrics, zari is not made of real gold and silver, but has cotton or polyester yarn at its core, wrapped by golden/silver metallic yarn.

Zari is the main material in most silk [[Sari|sarees]] and [[gharara]].  It is also used in other garments made of silk, like [[skirts]], tops and [[Dhoti|veshtis]].

==Manufacture==

Zari is basically a [[brocade]] of tinsel thread meant for weaving and embroidery. It is manufactured by winding or wrapping (covering) a flattened metallic strip made from pure gold, silver or slitted metallised polyester film, on a core yarn, usually of pure silk, viscose, cotton, nylon, polyester, P.P., mono/multi filament, wire, etc. Nowadays, it can broadly be divided into three types. Real zari, imitation zari, and metallic zari.

Real Zari is made from fine [[silver]] or [[gold]] thread is drawn from silver or gold alloys, which is flattened by passing it under through equal pressure rotating rollers. The flattened silver threads are wound on the base yarn that is usually made of silk. These spools with silk and silver threads are further flattened for electroplating. The threads are then plated with gold by the process of electroplating. The lustre of the gilded threads is further increased by passing them through a brightener. These threads are then wound on a reel.

In ancient times, when precious metals were cheaply and easily available,{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} only real zari threads were produced. Due to industrial revolution and invention of [[electroplating]] process, imitation techniques came into existence to cut the cost of precious metals. As copper is the most malleable and ductile metal after gold and silver, silver electroplated copper wire replaced pure silver. Various modern colours and chemicals are used to create/impart a golden hue instead of pure gold. The precious metals and copper too became dearer due to huge demand in various modern industries. Thus, a cheap and durable alternative was invented with non-tarnishing properties. [[Metallic zari]] came into vogue replacing traditional metals like gold, silver &amp; copper. This non-genuine modern zari is light in weight &amp; more durable than earlier editions. Also, it has the sought after properties of resistance to tarnishing and knotting.

Imitation zari is made when copper wires are drawn from copper alloys. It then undergoes a similar process, except in this case, they are electroplated with silver and then wound around the base yarn, and reeled. This type of zari is less expensive than pure zari, as silver electroplated copper is more economical.

Metallic zari is a modernized version of zari and it replaces traditional metals like gold, silver and copper. It is resistant, durable and light in weight. It is non-tarnishing and maintains its lustre for a considerable period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=PolkaCoffee|first1=RedPolka|title=The History &amp; Manufacturing of Zari|url=http://www.redpolka.com/polkacoffee/Design/threads-of-gold-the-charm-of-india-zari-work|website=RedPolka.com|publisher=Repolka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kanwal Jahan|first1=Process of Thread Making|title=Process of Thread Making|url=https://kanwaljahan.wordpress.com/articles/process-of-thread-making/|website=kanwaljahan.wordpress.com|publisher=Kanwal Jahan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Discovered India|first1=Zari|title=Zari|url=http://www.discoveredindia.com/gujarat/culture-in-gujarat/arts-and-crafts-of-gujarat/textile/zari.htm|website=discoveredindia|publisher=discoveredindia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Surat]] in the state of Gujarat on the west coast of India is the world's largest producer of all types of zari namely threads, cantile, laces, ribbons, borders, trims, fringes, edges, cordonettes, cords, etc. The art of zari making has been inherited from father to son for many centuries. It is recognised as one of the ancient handicrafts by the government of India. Women from different communities &amp; artisans produce zari and made-ups for weaving, embroidery, crocheting, braiding, etc.
