'''Alan Mathison Turing''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|OBE|FRS}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tj|ʊər|ɪ|ŋ}}; 23 June 1912&amp;nbsp;– 7 June 1954) was an English [[mathematician]], [[computer scientist]],  [[logic]]ian, [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]], [[philosopher]], and [[mathematical and theoretical biology|theoretical biologist]].&lt;ref name=whoswho&gt;{{Who's Who | author=Anon| surname = Turing | othernames = Alan Mathison | id = U243891 | year = 2017 | doi = 10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.U243891 | edition = online [[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing was highly influential in the development of [[theoretical computer science]], providing a formalisation of the concepts of [[algorithm]] and [[computation]] with the [[Turing machine]], which can be considered a model of a [[general-purpose computer]].&lt;ref name="frs"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sipser|2006|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beavers|2013|p=481}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognized in his home country during his lifetime due to his [[homosexuality]], which was then a crime in the UK.

During the [[Second World War]], Turing worked for the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)|Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&amp;CS) at [[Bletchley Park]], Britain's [[cryptanalysis|codebreaking]] centre that produced [[Ultra]] intelligence. For a time he led [[Hut 8]], the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German [[cipher]]s, including improvements to the pre-war Polish [[Bomba (cryptography)|bombe]] method, an [[electromechanics|electromechanical]] machine that could find settings for the [[Enigma machine]]. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], and in so doing helped win the war.&lt;ref name="bbc-copeland"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A number of sources state that Winston Churchill said that Turing made the single biggest contribution to Allied victory in the war against Nazi Germany. However both [[The Churchill Centre]] and Turing's biographer [[Andrew Hodges]] have said they know of no documentary evidence to support this claim nor of the date or context in which Churchill supposedly said it, and the Churchill Centre lists it among their Churchill 'Myths', see {{cite web | url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/myths/churchill-said-turing-made-the-single-biggest-contribution-to-allied-victory | title=Churchill Said Turing Made the Single Biggest Contribution to Allied Victory | first=Jonathan | last=Schilling | publisher=The Churchill Centre: Myths | accessdate=9 January 2015}} and {{cite web | url=http://www.turing.org.uk/book/update/part4.html | title=Part 4: The Relay Race | first=Andrew | last=Hodges | authorlink=Andrew Hodges | publisher=Update to ''[[Alan Turing: The Enigma]]'' | accessdate=9 January 2015}}  A [[BBC News]] profile piece that repeated the Churchill claim has subsequently been amended to say there is no evidence for it. See {{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8250592.stm | title=Profile: Alan Turing | first=Clare | last=Spencer | publisher=BBC News | date=11 September 2009 | quote=Update 13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Counterfactual history]] is difficult with respect to the effect Ultra intelligence had on the length of the war,&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{cite book | title=A Century of Spies: Intelligence in the Twentieth Century | first=Jeffery T. | last=Richelson | authorlink=Jeffrey T. Richelson | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York | date=1997 | page=296}} and {{cite book | first=Guy | last=Hartcup | authorlink=Guy Hartcup | title=The Effect of Science on the Second World War | publisher=Macmillan Press | location=Basingstoke, Hampshire | date=2000 | pages=96–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14&amp;nbsp;million lives.&lt;ref name="bbc-copeland"&gt;{{cite news | last=Copeland | first=Jack | authorlink=Jack Copeland | title= Alan Turing: The codebreaker who saved 'millions of lives' | date=18 June 2012 | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-18419691 | publisher=BBC News Technology | accessdate= 26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Turing worked at the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]], where he designed the [[Automatic Computing Engine|ACE]], among the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948 Turing joined [[Max Newman]]'s [[Computing Machine Laboratory]] at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]], where he helped develop the [[Manchester computers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|pp=231–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became interested in [[mathematical biology]]. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of [[morphogenesis]]&lt;ref name=googlescholar/&gt; and predicted [[Chemical clock|oscillating]] [[chemical reaction]]s such as the [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]], first observed in the 1960s.

Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts, when by the [[Labouchere Amendment]], "gross indecency" was a criminal offence in the UK. He accepted [[chemical castration]] treatment, with [[Diethylstilbestrol|DES]], as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from [[cyanide poisoning]]. An inquest determined his death as suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pease |first=Roland |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18561092 |publisher=BBC News  |date=26 June 2012 |accessdate=25 December 2013|title=Alan Turing: Inquest's suicide verdict 'not supportable'}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, following an [[Internet activism|Internet campaign]], British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] made an [[#Government apology and pardon support|official public apology]] on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he was treated".

==Early life and education==

===Family===
Turing was born in [[Maida Vale]], London,&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; while his father, Julius Mathison Turing (1873–1947), was on leave from his position with the [[Indian Civil Service]] (ICS) at [[Chatrapur]], then in the [[Madras Presidency]] and presently in [[Odisha]] state, in [[British India]].&lt;ref name = "Hodges1983P5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/scrapbook/early.html |title=The Alan Turing Internet Scrapbook |publisher=[[Alan Turing: The Enigma]] |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Turing's father was the son of a clergyman, the Rev.&amp;nbsp;John Robert Turing, from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a [[baronet]]. Turing's mother, Julius' wife, was Ethel Sara Turing (née Stoney 1881–1976),&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; daughter of Edward Waller Stoney, chief engineer of the [[Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway|Madras Railways]]. The Stoneys were a [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant]] [[Anglo-Irish]] [[gentry]] family from both [[County Tipperary]] and [[County Longford]], while Ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in [[County Clare]].&lt;ref&gt;Phil Maguire, "An Irishman's Diary", page 5. ''[[The Irish Times]]'', 23 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Julius' work with the ICS brought the family to British India, where his grandfather had been a general in the [[Bengal Army]]. However, both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in Britain, so they moved to [[Maida Vale]],&lt;ref name="englishheritaget"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.001002006005/chooseLetter/T |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jkyjSdgY?url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.001002006005/chooseLetter/T |archivedate=13 September 2009 |title=London Blue Plaques |accessdate=10 February 2007 |work=English Heritage |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; London, where Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912, as recorded by a [[blue plaque]] on the outside of the house of his birth,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.nature.com/london/2011/03/16/the-scientific-tourist-in-london-17-alan-turings-birth-place The Scientific Tourist In London: #17 Alan Turing's Birth Place], ''Nature''.

Turing's father's civil service commission was still active and during Turing's childhood years Turing's parents travelled between [[Hastings]] in England&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and India, leaving their two sons to stay with a retired [[British Army|Army]] couple. At Hastings, Turing stayed at Baston Lodge, Upper Maze Hill, [[St Leonards-on-Sea]], now marked with a blue plaque.&lt;ref name="Hastings &amp; St. Leonards Observer - 29 June 2012 - Plaque unveiled at Turing's home in St Leonards"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hastingsobserver.co.uk/news/plaque-unveiled-at-turing-s-home-in-st-leonards-1-4003535|title=Plaque unveiled at Turing's home in St Leonards|date=29 June 2012|work=[[Hastings &amp; St. Leonards Observer]]|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaque was unveiled on 23 June 2012, the centenary of Turing's birth.&lt;ref name="BBC News - 25 June 2012 - St Leonards plaque marks Alan Turing's early years"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-18580826|title=St Leonards plaque marks Alan Turing's early years|date=25 June 2012|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently.&lt;ref name=toolbox&gt;{{cite web |title=Alan Turing&amp;nbsp;– Towards a Digital Mind: Part 1 |first=G. James |last=Jones |date=11 December 2001 |url=http://www.systemtoolbox.com/article.php?history_id=3 |accessdate=27 July 2007 |work=System Toolbox |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803163318/http://www.systemtoolbox.com/article.php?history_id=3 |archivedate=3 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents purchased a house in [[Guildford]] in 1927, and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guildford-dragon.com/2012/11/29/founder-of-computer-science-alan-turings-guildford-stargazing/ |title=Guildford Dragon NEWS |publisher=The Guildford Dragon |date=29 November 2012 |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===School===
Turing's parents enrolled him at St Michael's, a day school at 20 Charles Road, [[St Leonards-on-Sea]], at the age of six. The headmistress recognised his talent early on, as did many of his subsequent teachers.

Between January 1922 and 1926, Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School, an independent school in the village of [[Frant]] in Sussex (now [[East Sussex]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldshirburnian.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TURING-Alan-Mathison.pdf|title=ALAN TURING ARCHIVE – SHERBORNE SCHOOL (ARCHON CODE: GB1949)|author=Alan Mathison|work=Sherborne School, Dorset|date=April 2016|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, at the age of 13, he went on to [[Sherborne School]], a boarding independent school in the market town of [[Sherborne]] in [[Dorset]]. The first day of term coincided with the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 General Strike]] in Britain, but he was so determined to attend, that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied {{convert|60|mi|km}} from [[Southampton]] to Sherborne, stopping overnight at an inn.&lt;ref name=metamagical&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metamagical Themas: Questing for the Essence of Mind and Pattern |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=o8jzWF7rD6oC&amp;pg=PA484 484]|first=Douglas R. |last=Hofstadter |year=1985 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-465-04566-9 |oclc=230812136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing's natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne, whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the [[classics]]. His headmaster wrote to his parents: "I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school, he must aim at becoming ''educated''. If he is to be solely a ''Scientific Specialist'', he is wasting his time at a public school".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary [[calculus]]. In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered [[Albert Einstein]]'s work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of [[Newton's laws of motion]] from a text in which this was never made explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christopher Morcom===
At Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom (13 July 1911-13 February 1930), who has been described as Turing's "first love". Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing's future endeavours, but it was cut short by Morcom's death, in February 1930, from complications of [[bovine tuberculosis]], contracted after drinking infected cow's milk some years previously.&lt;ref name=NYReviewBooks&gt;{{cite web|author=Caryl, Christian|title=Poor Imitation of Alan Turing|url=http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2014/dec/19/poor-imitation-alan-turing/|newspaper=[[New York Review of Books]]|date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Hassall, [http://oldshirburnian.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/The-Sherborne-Formula-Vivat-2012-2013-optimised.pdf 'The Sherborne Formula: The Making of Alan Turing'] 'Vivat!' 2012/13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=teuscher&gt;{{Cite book|last=Teuscher |first=Christof (ed.) |authorlink=Christof Teuscher |title=Alan Turing: Life and Legacy of a Great Thinker |year=2004 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]] |isbn=3-540-20020-7 |oclc=53434737 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom's mother Turing said:&lt;blockquote&gt;I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work, and in such things as astronomy (to which he introduced me) as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me&amp;nbsp;... I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive, because that is what he would like me to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some have speculated that Morcom's death was the cause of Turing's [[atheism]] and [[materialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gray, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990624,00.html Alan Turing] Time Magazine's Most Important People of the Century, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently, at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit, independent of the body and surviving death. In a later letter, also written to Morcom's mother, Turing said: &lt;blockquote&gt;Personally, I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body&amp;nbsp;... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body [can] hold on to a 'spirit', whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies, the 'mechanism' of the body, holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later, perhaps immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===University and work on computability===
After Sherborne, Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at [[King's College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; where he was awarded first-class honours in mathematics. In 1935, at the age of 22, he was elected a [[fellow]] of King's on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the [[central limit theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;See Section 3 of John Aldrich, "England and Continental Probability in the Inter-War Years", Journal Electronique d'Histoire des Probabilités et de la Statistique, vol. 5/2 [http://www.jehps.net/decembre2009.html Decembre 2009] Journal Electronique d'Histoire des Probabilités et de la Statistique&lt;/ref&gt; Unknown to the committee, the theorem had already been proven, in 1922, by [[Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=88, 94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Turing published his paper "[[On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem]]" (1936).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this paper, Turing reformulated [[Kurt Gödel]]'s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as [[Turing machine]]s. The ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' (decision problem) was originally posed by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]] in 1928. Turing proved that his "universal computing machine" would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an [[algorithm]]. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the ''decision problem'' by first showing that the [[halting problem]] for Turing machines is [[Decision problem|undecidable]]: It is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt.

[[File:20130808 Kings College Front Court Fountain Crop 03.jpg|thumb|right|[[King's College, Cambridge]], where Turing was a student in 1931 and became a Fellow in 1935. The computer room is named after him.]]
Although [[Turing's proof]] was published shortly after [[Alonzo Church]]'s equivalent proof using his [[lambda calculus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Church|1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing's approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grime|first1=James|title=What Did Turing Do for Us?|url=https://nrich.maths.org/8050|website=[[NRICH]]|publisher=[[University of Cambridge]]|accessdate=28 February 2016|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also included a notion of a 'Universal Machine' (now known as a [[universal Turing machine]]), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine (as indeed could Church's lambda calculus). According to the [[Church–Turing thesis]], Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable. [[John von Neumann]] acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing's paper.&lt;ref&gt;"von Neumann&amp;nbsp;... firmly emphasised to me, and to others I am sure, that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing—insofar as not anticipated by Babbage, Lovelace and others." Letter by [[Stanley Frankel]] to [[Brian Randell]], 1972, quoted in [[Jack Copeland]] (2004) ''The Essential Turing'', p.&amp;nbsp;22.&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, Turing machines are a central object of study in [[theory of computation]].

From September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at [[Princeton University]], in the second year as a [[Jane Eliza Procter Fellowship|Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow]]. In addition to his purely mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1938, he obtained his PhD from the [[Princeton University Department of Mathematics|Department of Mathematics]] at Princeton;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Career and research==
When Turing returned to Cambridge, he attended lectures given in 1939 by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] about the [[foundations of mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lectures have been reconstructed verbatim, including interjections from Turing and other students, from students' notes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cora Diamond]] (ed.), ''Wittgenstein's Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics'', University of Chicago Press, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed, with Turing defending [[Philosophy of mathematics#Formalism|formalism]] and Wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths, but rather invents them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cryptanalysis===
During the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at [[Bletchley Park]]. The historian and wartime codebreaker [[Asa Briggs]] has said, "You needed exceptional talent, you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing's was that genius."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media | last = Briggs | first = Asa | author-link = Asa Briggs, Baron Briggs | title = Britain's Greatest Codebreaker | type=TV broadcast | publisher = [[Channel 4|UK Channel 4]] | date=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From September 1938, Turing had been working part-time with the [[Government Code and Cypher School#Government Communications Headquarters|GC&amp;CS]], the British codebreaking organisation. He concentrated on [[cryptanalysis of the Enigma]] with [[Dilly Knox]], a senior GC&amp;CS codebreaker.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Copeland|Copeland, Jack]], "Colossus and the Dawning of the Computer Age", p.&amp;nbsp;352 in ''Action This Day'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the July 1939 [[Warsaw]] meeting at which the [[Polish Cipher Bureau]] had provided the British and French with the details of the wiring of [[Enigma rotor details|Enigma rotors]] and their method of decrypting [[Enigma code]] messages, Turing and Knox started to work on a less fragile approach to the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2004a|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish method relied on an insecure [[Cryptanalysis#Indicator|indicator]] procedure that the Germans were likely to change, which they did in May 1940. Turing's approach was more general, using [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Crib-based decryption|crib-based decryption]] for which he produced the functional specification of the [[bombe]] (an improvement of the Polish [[Bomba (cryptography)|Bomba]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clark |first=Liat |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-06/18/turing-contributions?page=all |title=Turing's achievements: codebreaking, AI and the birth of computer science (Wired UK) |work=Wired  |date=18 June 2012 |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Turing flat.jpg|thumb|right|Two cottages in the stable yard at [[Bletchley Park]]. Turing worked here in 1939 and 1940, before moving to [[Hut 8]].]]
On 4 September 1939, the day after the UK declared war on Germany, Turing reported to Bletchley Park, the wartime station of GC&amp;CS.&lt;ref name=Copeland2006p378&gt;Copeland, 2006 p.&amp;nbsp;378.&lt;/ref&gt;
Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war. The others were: deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy; developing a statistical procedure for making much more efficient use of the bombes dubbed ''[[Banburismus]]''; developing a procedure for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the [[Lorenz SZ 40/42]] (''Tunny'') dubbed ''[[Turingery]]'' and, towards the end of the war, the development of a portable [[secure voice]] scrambler at [[Her Majesty's Government Communications Centre|Hanslope Park]] that was codenamed ''Delilah''.

By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process, Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches, titled ''The Applications of Probability to Cryptography''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Turing | first = Alan | year = c. 1941 | title = The Applications of Probability to Cryptography | id = The National Archives (United Kingdom): HW 25/37| url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C11510465 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Paper on Statistics of Repetitions'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Turing | first = Alan | year = c. 1941 | title = Paper on Statistics of Repetitions | id = The National Archives (United Kingdom): HW 25/38 |url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C11510466 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; which were of such value to GC&amp;CS and its successor [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]] that they were not released to the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|UK National Archives]] until April 2012, shortly before the centenary of his birth. A GCHQ mathematician, "who identified himself only as Richard," said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their importance, and their relevance to post-war cryptanalysis:&lt;ref name=bbcrichard&gt;{{cite news |last=Vallance |first=Chris |title=Alan Turing papers on code breaking released by GCHQ |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17771962|accessdate=20 April 2012 |publisher=BBC News |date=19 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|text=[He] said the fact that the contents had been restricted "shows what a tremendous importance it has in the foundations of our subject". ... The papers detailed using "mathematical analysis to try and determine which are the more likely settings so that they can be tried as quickly as possible." ... Richard said that GCHQ had now "squeezed the juice" out of the two papers and was "happy for them to be released into the public domain".}}

Turing had a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park. He was known to his colleagues as "Prof" and his treatise on Enigma was known as the "Prof's Book".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Ronald Lewin]], [[I.J. Good|Jack Good]], a cryptanalyst who worked with Turing, said of his colleague:

{{quote|In the first week of June each year he would get a bad attack of hay fever, and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas mask to keep the pollen off. His bicycle had a fault: the chain would come off at regular intervals. Instead of having it mended he would count the number of times the pedals went round and would get off the bicycle in time to adjust the chain by hand. Another of his eccentricities is that he chained his mug to the radiator pipes to prevent it being stolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewin|1978|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While working at Bletchley, Turing, who was a talented [[Long-distance running|long-distance runner]], occasionally ran the {{convert|40|mi}} to London when he was needed for meetings,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Brown | first = Anthony Cave | author-link = Anthony Cave Brown | title = Bodyguard of Lies: The Extraordinary True Story Behind D-Day | publisher=The Lyons Press | year = 1975 | isbn = 978-1-59921-383-5 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was capable of world-class marathon standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/10/alan-turing-2012-olympics|title=An Olympic honour for Alan Turing|author=Graham-Cumming, John|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 March 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Pat |last=Butcher | url=http://www.globerunner.org/index.php/09/in-praise-of-great-men/ | title=In Praise of Great Men | publisher=Globe Runner | date=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team, hampered by an injury. His tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than British silver medallist Thomas Richards' Olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes.

In 1946, Turing was appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) by King [[George VI]] for his wartime services, but his work remained secret for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Alan Turing: Colleagues share their memories | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18541715 | date = 23 June 2012 |publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thegazette.co.uk"&gt;https://www.thegazette.co.uk/all-notices/content/114&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bombe===
{{Main|Bombe}}

Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park,&lt;ref name="Copeland2006p378" /&gt; Turing had specified an electromechanical machine called the [[bombe]], which could break Enigma more effectively than the Polish ''[[bomba (cryptography)|bomba kryptologiczna]]'', from which its name was derived. The bombe, with an enhancement suggested by mathematician [[Gordon Welchman]], became one of the primary tools, and the major automated one, used to attack Enigma-enciphered messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Welchman |first= Gordon |author-link= Gordon Welchman |origyear= 1982 |year= 1997 |title= The Hut Six story: Breaking the Enigma codes |page= 81 |publication-place= Cleobury Mortimer, England |publisher= M&amp;M Baldwin |isbn= 9780947712341 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bombe-rebuild.jpg|thumbnail|right|A complete and working replica of a [[bombe]] now at [[The National Museum of Computing]] on Bletchley Park]]The bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message (i.e., rotor order, rotor settings and plugboard settings) using a suitable ''[[crib (cryptanalysis)|crib]]'': a fragment of probable [[plaintext]]. For each possible setting of the rotors (which had on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; states, or 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; states for the four-rotor U-boat variant),&lt;ref&gt;Professor Jack Good in "The Men Who Cracked Enigma", 2003: with his caveat: "if my memory is correct".&lt;/ref&gt; the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib, implemented [[Electromechanics|electromechanically]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting, moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded, leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter, which was impossible with the Enigma. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oakley|2006|p=40/03B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1941, Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman, [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]] and [[Stuart Milner-Barry]] were frustrated. Building on the [[Biuro Szyfrów#Gift to allies|work of the Poles]], they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals, but their limited staff and bombes meant they could not translate all the signals. In the summer, they had considerable success, and shipping losses had fallen to under 100,000 tons a month; however, they badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels, but had failed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On 28 October they wrote directly to [[Winston Churchill]] explaining their difficulties, with Turing as the first named. They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Andrew Hodges]], biographer of Turing, later wrote, "This letter had an electric effect."&lt;ref name="Hodges 1983 221"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill wrote a memo to [[Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay|General Ismay]], which read: "ACTION THIS DAY. Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done." On 18 November, the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken.&lt;ref name="Hodges 1983 221"/&gt; The cryptographers at Bletchley Park did not know of the Prime Minister's response, but as Milner-Barry recalled, "All that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth."&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, ''The Essential Turing'', [http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/turingletter.pdf pp. 336–337].&lt;/ref&gt; More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war.&lt;ref name=codebreaker&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Copeland | first1 = Jack | last2 = Proudfoot | first2 = Diane | authorlink = Jack Copeland | title = Alan Turing, Codebreaker and Computer Pioneer | url = http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/pages/Reference%20Articles/codebreaker.html | publisher = alanturing.net |date=May 2004 | accessdate =27 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hut 8 and the naval Enigma===
Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#German naval Enigma|German naval Enigma]] "because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself".&lt;ref name=MahonP14&gt;{{Harvnb|Mahon|1945|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1939, Turing solved the essential part of the naval [[Enigma machine#Indicator|indicator]] system, which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services.&lt;ref name=MahonP14 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|pp=184–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same night, he also conceived of the idea of ''[[Banburismus]]'', a sequential statistical technique (what [[Abraham Wald]] later called [[sequential analysis]]) to assist in breaking the naval Enigma, "though I was not sure that it would work in practice, and was not, in fact, sure until some days had actually broken."&lt;ref name=MahonP14 /&gt; For this, he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the ''[[Ban (unit)|ban]]''. ''Banburismus'' could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors, substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=242–245}}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington; he also visited their [[United States Naval Computing Machine Laboratory|Computing Machine Laboratory]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]].

Turing's reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic:
{{quote|text=The American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes, one for each wheel order. I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this programme, but thought that no particular purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use them in that way.

Their test (of commutators) can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices. Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do something about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Turing |first=Alan M. |date=2001 |journal=Cryptologia |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |doi=10.1080/0161-110191889734 |title=Visit to National Cash Register Corporation of Dayton, Ohio }}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=}}

During this trip, he also assisted at [[Bell Labs]] with the development of [[secure speech]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=245–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his absence, [[Colonel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]] had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8, although Alexander had been ''de facto'' head for some time (Turing having little interest in the day-to-day running of the section). Turing became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Alexander wrote of Turing's contribution:
{{quote|There should be no question in anyone's mind that Turing's work was the biggest factor in Hut 8's success. In the early days, he was the only cryptographer who thought the problem worth tackling and not only was he primarily responsible for the main theoretical work within the Hut, but he also shared with Welchman and Keen the chief credit for the invention of the bombe. It is always difficult to say that anyone is 'absolutely indispensable', but if anyone was indispensable to Hut 8, it was Turing. The pioneer's work always tends to be forgotten when experience and routine later make everything seem easy and many of us in Hut 8 felt that the magnitude of Turing's contribution was never fully realised by the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|circa 1945|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Turingery===
In July 1942, Turing devised a technique termed ''[[Turingery]]'' (or jokingly ''Turingismus'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; for use against the [[Lorenz cipher]] messages produced by the Germans' new ''Geheimschreiber'' (secret writer) machine. This was a [[teleprinter]] [[Rotor machine|rotor cipher attachment]] codenamed ''Tunny'' at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a method of ''wheel-breaking'', i.e., a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny's wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also introduced the Tunny team to [[Tommy Flowers]] who, under the guidance of [[Max Newman]], went on to build the [[Colossus computer]], the world's first programmable digital electronic computer, which replaced a simpler prior machine (the [[Heath Robinson (codebreaking machine)|Heath Robinson]]), and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer. Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about [[cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gannon|2007|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hilton|2006|pp=197–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|pp=382, 383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delilah===
Following his work at Bell Labs in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=245–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system, and in the latter part of the war, he moved to work for the Secret Service's Radio Security Service (later [[Her Majesty's Government Communications Centre|HMGCC]]) at [[Hanslope Park]]. There he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer Donald Bayley. Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable [[secure voice]] communications machine codenamed ''Delilah''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended for different applications, lacking capability for use with long-distance radio transmissions, and in any case, Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war. Though the system worked fully, with Turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a [[Winston Churchill]] speech, Delilah was not adopted for use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing also consulted with Bell Labs on the development of [[SIGSALY]], a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war.

===Early computers and the Turing test===
[[File:Alan Turing 78 High Street Hampton blue plaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque, 78 High Street, [[Hampton, London|Hampton]]]]
Between 1945 and 1947, Turing lived in [[Hampton, London|Hampton]], London,&lt;ref&gt;{{openplaque|1619}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he worked on the design of the [[ACE (computer)|ACE]] (Automatic Computing Engine) at the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory (NPL)]]. He presented a paper on 19 February 1946, which was the first detailed design of a [[stored-program computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Von Neumann]]'s incomplete ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]'' had predated Turing's paper, but it was much less detailed and, according to [[John R.

According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer [[Heinz Billing]] from the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics]], published by Genscher, Düsseldorf, there was a meeting between Turing and [[Konrad Zuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathcomp.leeds.ac.uk/turing2012/Images/Turing_Zuse.pdf|title=Did Alan Turing interrogate Konrad Zuse in Göttingen in 1947?|author=Bruderer, Herbert |accessdate= 7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took place in [[Göttingen]] in 1947. The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants were Womersley, Turing, Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse, Walther, and Billing (for more details see Herbert Bruderer, ''Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz'').

Turing was appointed [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in the [[School of Mathematics, University of Manchester|Mathematics Department]] at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] in 1948 and in 1949, became Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory there, working on software for one of the earliest [[Von Neumann architecture|stored-program]] computers—the [[Manchester Mark 1]]. During this time he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics,&lt;ref name="doi10.1093/qjmam/1.1.287"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1 = Turing |first1 = A. M.|doi = 10.1093/qjmam/1.1.287 |title = Rounding-Off Errors in Matrix Processes |journal = The Quarterly Journal of Mechanics and Applied Mathematics |volume = 1| pages = 287–308 |year = 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in "[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]" (''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', October 1950), Turing addressed the problem of [[artificial intelligence]], and proposed an experiment that became known as the [[Turing test]], an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called "intelligent". The idea was that a computer could be said to "think" if a human interrogator could not tell it apart, through conversation, from a human being.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stevan Harnad|Harnad, Stevan]] (2008) [http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/262954/ The Annotation Game: On Turing (1950) on Computing, Machinery and Intelligence]. In: Epstein, Robert &amp; Peters, Grace (Eds.) ''Parsing the Turing Test: Philosophical and Methodological Issues in the Quest for the Thinking Computer''. Springer&lt;/ref&gt; In the paper, Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind, it would be better rather to produce a simpler one to simulate a child's mind and then to subject it to a course of education. A [[Turing test#Reverse Turing test and CAPTCHA|reversed]] form of the Turing test is widely used on the Internet; the [[CAPTCHA]] test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer.

In 1948 Turing, working with his former undergraduate colleague, [[D. G. Champernowne]], began writing a [[chess]] program for a computer that did not yet exist. By 1950, the program was completed and dubbed the [[Turbochamp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Liat|title=Turing's achievements: codebreaking, AI and the birth of computer science|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-06/18/turing-contributions?page=all|work=Wired|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, he tried to implement it on a [[Ferranti Mark 1]], but lacking enough power, the computer was unable to execute the program. Instead, Turing "ran" the program by flipping through the pages of the algorithm and carrying out its instructions on a chessboard, taking about half an hour per move. The game was recorded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1356927 Alan Turing vs Alick Glennie (1952) "Turing Test"] Chessgames.com&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Garry Kasparov]], Turing's program "played a recognizable game of chess."&lt;ref&gt;Kasparov, Garry, Smart machines will free us all, ''The Wall Street Journal'', 15–16 April 2017, p. c3&lt;/ref&gt; The program lost to Turing's colleague [[Alick Glennie]], although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne's wife,

===Pattern formation and mathematical biology===
In 1951, when Turing was 39 years old, he turned to [[Mathematical and theoretical biology|mathematical biology]], finally publishing his masterpiece "[[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]]" in January 1952. He was interested in [[morphogenesis]], the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms. Among other things, he wanted to understand Fibonacci [[phyllotaxis]], the existence of [[Fibonacci numbers]] in plant structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turing's achievements: codebreaking, AI and the birth of computer science|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-06/18/turing-contributions?page=all|work=Wired |accessdate=12 February 2013|author= Clark, Liat|author2=Ian Steadman|date=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space, termed a [[reaction-diffusion system]], could account for "the main phenomena of morphogenesis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Alan M. | last=Turing | authorlink=Alan Turing | title=The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London]] B | date=14 August 1952 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1952.0012 | volume=237 | number=641 | pages=37–72 | bibcode=1952RSPTB.237...37T }}&lt;/ref&gt; He used systems of [[partial differential equations]] to model catalytic chemical reactions. For example, if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place, and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A, then we say that the reaction is [[autocatalytic]], and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations. Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A, but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates, then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did. To calculate the extent of this, Turing would have needed a powerful computer, but these were not so freely available in 1951, so he had to use linear approximations to solve the equations by hand. These calculations gave the right qualitative results, and produced, for example, a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots. The Russian biochemist [[Boris Pavlovich Belousov|Boris Belousov]] had performed experiments with similar results, but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. Belousov was not aware of Turing's paper in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]''.&lt;ref&gt;John Gribbin, ''Deep Simplicity'', p. 126, Random House, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Although published before the structure and role of [[DNA]] was understood, Turing's work on morphogenesis remains relevant today, and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swintons.net/deodands/archives/000087.html |title=Turing's Last, Lost work |accessdate=28 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030823032620/http://www.swintons.net/deodands/archives/000087.html |archivedate=23 August 2003 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the early applications of Turing's paper was the work by James Murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats, large and small.&lt;ref&gt;James Murray, ''How the leopard gets its spots'', Scientific American, vol 258, number 3, p.&amp;nbsp;80, March 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Murray, ''Mathematical Biology I'', 2007, Chapter 6, Springer Verlag&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Gibbin, Deep Simplicity, p.&amp;nbsp;134, Random House, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Further research in the area suggests that Turing's work can partially explain the growth of "feathers, hair follicles, the branching pattern of lungs, and even the left-right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.338.6113.1406|pmid=23239707|title=Turing Pattern Fingered for Digit Formation|journal=Science|volume=338|issue=6113|pages=1406|year=2012|last1=Vogel|first1=G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Sheth, et al. found that in mice, removal of Hox genes causes an increase in the number of digits without an increase in the overall size of the limb, suggesting that Hox genes control digit formation by tuning the wavelength of a Turing-type mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Sheth |first1 = R. |last2 = Marcon |first2 = L. |last3 = Bastida |first3 = M.

==Personal life==
In 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague [[Joan Clarke]], a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée, who was reportedly "unfazed" by the revelation, Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|pp=176–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conviction for indecency===
In January 1952, Turing, then 39, started a relationship with Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. Turing had met Murray just before Christmas outside the [[Dancehouse|Regal Cinema]] when walking down Manchester's [[Wilmslow Road|Oxford Road]] and invited him to lunch. On 23 January, Turing's house was burgled. Murray told Turing that the burglar was an acquaintance of his, and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=458}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both men were charged with "[[gross indecency]]" under [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885#Section 11|Section 11]] of the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]].&lt;ref name=LeavittP268&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial [[committal procedure|committal proceedings]] for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing's solicitor "reserved his defence", i.e., did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations.

Later, convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor, Turing entered a plea of guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alan Turing: The Enigma |authorlink=Andrew Hodges |last=Hodges |first=Andrew |page=463 |date=27 May 2012 |isbn=0-691-15564-X |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HyMcH_9eTtoC&amp;pg=PA463&amp;q=%2227%20february%22%20%22alan%20turing%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case, ''[[Elizabeth II|Regina]] v.

He accepted the option of treatment via injections of what was then called stilboestrol (now known as [[diethylstilbestrol]] or DES), a synthetic [[oestrogen]]; this treatment was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing [[impotence|impotent]] and caused [[gynaecomastia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Alan Turing: The Enigma The Centenary Edition | publisher=Princeton University | author= Hodges, Andrew | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; fulfilling in the literal sense Turing's prediction that "no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I've not found out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letters of Note: Yours in distress, Alan |last=Turing |first=Alan |year=1952 |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/yours-in-distress-alan.html |archivedate=16 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CxLiSeL9?url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/yours-in-distress-alan.html |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alan Turing: The Enigma |authorlink=Andrew Hodges |last=Hodges |first=Andrew  |page=xxviii |date=27 May 2012 |isbn=0-691-15564-X |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CGmyLDrbQtQC&amp;pg=PT21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray was given a conditional discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing's conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ), the British [[signals intelligence]] agency that had evolved from GC&amp;CS in 1946, though he kept his academic job. He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952, but was free to visit other European countries. Turing was never accused of espionage but, in common with all who had worked at Bletchley Park, he was prevented by the [[Official Secrets Act]] from discussing his war work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
On 8 June 1954, Turing's housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day. A [[post-mortem]] examination established that the cause of death was [[cyanide poisoning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alan-Turing#toc330986|title=Alan Turing {{!}} Biography, Facts, &amp; Education|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=488}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed. An [[Inquests in England and Wales|inquest]] determined that he had committed suicide, and he was cremated at [[Woking Crematorium]] on 12 June 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=529}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing's ashes were scattered there, just as his father's had been. Andrew Hodges and another biographer, [[David Leavitt]], have both suggested that Turing was re-enacting a scene from the [[Walt Disney]] film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937), his favourite fairy tale, both noting that (in Leavitt's words) he took "an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|p=140}} and {{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=149, 489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophy professor [[Jack Copeland]] has questioned various aspects of the coroner's historical verdict. He suggests an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing's death, this being the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus for [[electroplating]] gold onto spoons, which uses potassium cyanide to [[Gold#Commercial chemistry|dissolve the gold]]. Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland notes that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before bed, and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half-eaten.&lt;ref name = "Copeland"&gt;{{Cite news | first = Roland | last = Pease | title = Alan Turing: Inquest's suicide verdict 'not supportable' | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18561092 | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 23 June 2012 | accessdate =23 June 2012 | quote = ''We have&amp;nbsp;... been recreating the narrative of Turing's life, and we have recreated him as an unhappy young man who committed suicide. But the evidence is not there"''
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Turing had reportedly borne his legal setbacks and hormone treatment (which had been discontinued a year previously) "with good humour" and had shown no sign of despondency prior to his death, even setting down a list of tasks he intended to complete upon return to his office after the holiday weekend.&lt;ref name = "Copeland"/&gt; Turing's mother believed that the ingestion was accidental, resulting from her son's careless storage of laboratory chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/books-manuscripts/turing-ethel-sara-series-of-11-5685694-details.aspx Letter to Robin Gandy, 28 July 1954]&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Andrew Hodges suggests Turing arranged the delivery of the equipment to deliberately allow his mother [[plausible deniability]] regarding any suicide claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=488, 489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the UK premiere of a film based on Turing's life, ''[[The Imitation Game]]'', the producers thanked Leech for bringing the topic to public attention and securing Turing's pardon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.libdemvoice.org/my-proudest-day-as-a-liberal-democrat-43430.html|title=My proudest day as a Liberal Democrat|work=Liberal Democrat Voice|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; His campaign turned to acquiring pardons for the 75,000 other men convicted of the same crime. Leech's campaign gained public support from leading scientists, including [[Stephen Hawking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/manchester-codebreaker-alan-turing-pardoned-6442836|title=Alan Turing pardoned by The Queen for his 'unjust and discriminatory' conviction for homosexuality|last=Britton|first=Paul|work=Manchester Evening News|date=2013-12-24|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July 2012, a bill was introduced in the [[British House of Lords|House of Lords]] to grant a statutory pardon to Turing for offences under section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, of which he was convicted on 31 March 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/alanturingstatutorypardon.html |title=Bill |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |date=26 July 2012 |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late in the year in a letter to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', the physicist Stephen Hawking and 10 other signatories including the [[Astronomer Royal]] [[Martin Rees, Baron Rees of Ludlow|Lord Rees]], [[List of presidents of the Royal Society|President of the Royal Society]] Sir [[Paul Nurse]], [[Jean Barker, Baroness Trumpington|Lady Trumpington]] (who worked for Turing during the war) and [[John Sharkey, Baron Sharkey|Lord Sharkey]] (the bill's sponsor) called on Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] to act on the pardon request.&lt;ref&gt;Pearse, Damian, [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/dec/14/alan-turing-pardon-stephen-hawking "Alan Turing should be pardoned, argue Stephen Hawking and top scientists"], ''The Guardian'', 13 December 2012.

At the bill's second reading in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 29 November 2013, Conservative MP [[Christopher Chope]] objected to the bill, delaying its passage.

In a letter to the Prime Minister, [[David Cameron]], human rights advocate [[Peter Tatchell]] criticised the decision to single out Turing due to his fame and achievements when thousands of others convicted under the same law have not received pardons.&lt;ref name = "UKHP"&gt;{{Cite news | first = Peter| last = Tatchell | title = Alan Turing: Was He Murdered By the Security Services? | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/peter-g-tatchell/alan-turing-pardon_b_4498564.html | publisher = The Huffington Post UK | date = 24 December 2013 | accessdate = 29 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tatchell also called for a new investigation into Turing's death:

{{quote|A new inquiry is long overdue, even if only to dispel any doubts about the true cause of his death—including speculation that he was murdered by the security services (or others). I think murder by state agents is unlikely. There is no known evidence pointing to any such act.

Turing was one of four mathematicians examined in the BBC documentary entitled ''Dangerous Knowledge'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/dangerous-knowledge.shtml|title=Dangerous Knowledge|publisher=BBC Four|date=11 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102045025/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/dangerous-knowledge.shtml|archive-date=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Princeton Alumni Weekly]]'' named Turing the second most significant alumnus in the history of [[Princeton University]], second only to President [[James Madison]]. A 1.5-ton, life-size statue of Turing was unveiled on 19 June 2007 at Bletchley Park. Built from approximately half a million pieces of Welsh [[slate]], it was sculpted by [[Stephen Kettle]], having been commissioned by the American billionaire [[Sidney Frank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/docview.rhtm/454075/article.html Bletchley Park Unveils Statue Commemorating Alan Turing], Bletchley Park press release, 20 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing has been honoured in various ways in [[Manchester]], the city where he worked towards the end of his life. In 1994, a stretch of the [[A6010 road]] (the [[Manchester]] city intermediate ring road) was named "Alan Turing Way". A bridge carrying this road was widened, and carries the name Alan Turing Bridge. A [[Alan Turing Memorial|statue of Turing]] was unveiled in Manchester on 23 June 2001 in [[Sackville Park]], between the University of Manchester building on Whitworth Street and [[Canal Street, Manchester|Canal Street]]. The memorial statue depicts the "father of computer science" sitting on a bench at a central position in the park. Turing is shown holding an apple. The cast bronze bench carries in relief the text 'Alan Mathison Turing 1912–1954', and the motto 'Founder of Computer Science' as it could appear if encoded by an [[Enigma machine]]: 'IEKYF ROMSI ADXUO KVKZC GUBJ'. However, the meaning of the coded message is disputed, as the 'u' in 'computer' matches up with the 'u' in 'ADXUO'. As a letter encoded by an enigma machine can not appear as itself, the actual message behind the code is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://benosteen.wordpress.com/2010/09/23/what-does-the-code-on-the-alan-turing-memorial-actually-say/|title=What does the code on the Alan Turing Memorial actually say?|date=2010-09-23|work=Random Hacks|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sackville Park Turing plaque.jpg|thumb|right|Turing memorial statue plaque in Sackville Park, Manchester]]
A plaque at the statue's feet reads 'Father of computer science, mathematician, logician, wartime codebreaker, victim of prejudice'. There is also a [[Bertrand Russell]] quotation: "Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture." The sculptor buried his own old [[Amstrad]] computer under the [[plinth]] as a tribute to "the godfather of all modern computers".&lt;ref name="computerburied"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/computer-buried-in-tribute-to-genius-1186583 | title=Computer buried in tribute to genius | work=Manchester Evening News | date=17 February 2007 | accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Turing as one of the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|100 Most Important People of the 20th century]] and stated, "The fact remains that everyone who taps at a keyboard, opening a spreadsheet or a word-processing program, is working on an incarnation of a Turing machine."&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;{{cite news| title =Alan Turing&amp;nbsp;– Time 100 People of the Century |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990624,00.html |work=Time |quote=Providing a blueprint for the electronic digital computer.

To mark the 100th anniversary of Turing's birth, the Turing Centenary Advisory Committee (TCAC) co-ordinated the [[Alan Turing Year]], a year-long programme of events around the world honouring Turing's life and achievements. The TCAC, chaired by [[S. Barry Cooper]] with Turing's nephew Sir John Dermot Turing acting as Honorary President, worked with the University of Manchester faculty members and a broad spectrum of people from Cambridge University and [[Bletchley Park]].

On 23 June 2012, Google featured an interactive [[Google doodle#Google Doodle|doodle]] where visitors had to change the instructions of a Turing Machine, so when run, the symbols on the tape would match a provided sequence, featuring "Google" in [[ITA2|Baudot-Murray code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/technologylive/post/2012/06/google-doodle-honors-alan-turing/1 |title=Google Doodle honors Alan Turing |newspaper=USA Today |date= 22 June 2012|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{Cite book | last = Turing | first = Sara Stoney | title = Alan M Turing | publisher=W Heffer | year = 1959}} Turing's mother, who survived him by many years, wrote this 157-page biography of her son, glorifying his life. It was published in 1959, and so could not cover his war work. Scarcely 300 copies were sold (Sara Turing to Lyn Newman, 1967, Library of [[St John's College, Cambridge]]). The six-page foreword by [[Lyn Irvine]] includes reminiscences and is more frequently quoted. It was re-published by Cambridge University Press in 2012, to honour the centenary of his birth, and included a new foreword by [[Martin Davis]], as well as a never-before-published memoir by Turing's older brother John F. Turing.

It was rumoured that she became the mistress of her half first cousin [[Edward I of England|Prince Edward]], while she was briefly imprisoned on account of her husband's treason.

== Family ==
Alice de Lusigan was born sometime after October 1236&lt;ref name="Medieval LandsAngoulême"&gt;Medieval Lands"Angoulême".&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Angoulême]], [[Charente]], France, the daughter of [[Hugh XI of Lusignan]], Seigneur de Lusignan, Couhe, et de Peyrat, [[Count of La Marche]] and [[Angoulême]], and [[Yolande de Dreux, Countess of Penthièvre and of Porhoet]],&lt;ref name="The Complete Peerage." /&gt; and sister of [[Hugh XII of Lusignan]]. By her paternal grandmother, [[Isabella of Angoulême]], Queen-Consort of King [[John of England]], she was niece, in the half blood, of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]].

== Marriage ==
She arrived in England on an unrecorded date. On 6 April 1250, her father was killed in [[Battle of Fariskur|battle at Fariskur]], [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Medieval LandsAngoulême" /&gt; In 1253, Alice married [[Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester]] (2 September 1243 – 7 December 1295). He was the son of [[Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford]] and [[Maud de Lacy, Countess of Gloucester|Maud de Lacy]].  He was ten years old at the time of his marriage. In later years, "Red" Gilbert would become one of the most powerful and important noblemen in the kingdom. The marriage produced two daughters.

===Issue===
* Isabel de Clare (10 March 1263 – 1333), married firstly [[Guy de Beauchamp]], 10th [[Earl of Warwick]], and secondly [[Maurice de Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley]]. She died childless.
* Joan de Clare (1264- after 1302), married firstly [[Duncan Macduff, 7th Earl of Fife]] by whom she had issue, and secondly Gervase Avenel.

== Prince Edward ==
[[File:Gal nations edward i.jpg|thumb|180px|right|King [[Edward I of England]], alleged lover of Alice of Lusignan]]
Alice was described as being very beautiful with dark hair and dark eyes. She was also flirtatious and provocative.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Costain "The Magnificent Century", Page236&lt;/ref&gt; She was said to strongly resemble her grandmother Queen Isabella.&lt;ref&gt;Costain, page 236&lt;/ref&gt; In the late summer of 1259, she formed a friendship with her half first cousin, Prince Edward, who would later ascend the throne as King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]. When [[civil war]] broke out and the barons rose up against the King led by [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], Alice's husband supported them. Prince Edward, who headed the Royalist Army, quickly went to war against the traitors who had betrayed his father. [[Tonbridge Castle]], one of Gloucester's properties was captured by Prince Edward's troops and Alice, who was resident in the castle at the time, taken prisoner. It is alleged that the Prince and his cousin became lovers while she was imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Costain,page 261.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward's young wife, [[Eleanor of Castile]] was in France at the time. Alice was released shortly afterward.

At the [[Battle of Lewes]] on 14 May 1264 King Henry's forces were defeated by those led by Simon and Gloucester who commanded the second line of battle. After the victory, Gilbert and his brother Thomas were both knighted. Simon de Montfort became the [[de facto]] ruler of England. On 20 October the Earl of Gloucester was [[excommunicated]]. A month later, he fell out with Montfort and transferred his allegiance to Prince Edward. Later after the [[Battle of Evesham]], in which Simon de Montfort was killed, Gloucester was richly rewarded for his support of Prince Edward and was granted the castle and title of [[Abergavenny]] and  the castle of [[Brecknock]]. He became the most powerful lord in the [[Welsh Marches]]. In 1267, he and Alice began to live apart; on 18 July 1271 they formally separated, and the marriage was annulled on 16 May 1285. Gloucester married secondly, on 30 April 1290, [[Joan of Acre]], daughter of Prince Edward who had acceded in 1272 as King Edward I of England. Alice died in May 1290. Through her daughter Joan, Alice was the grandmother of [[Isabella MacDuff]], Countess of Buchan, who placed the crown of [[Scotland]] upon the head of [[Robert the Bruce]] at [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]].

'''''All That Jazz''''' is a 1979 American [[musical film|musical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Bob Fosse]]. The screenplay, by [[Robert Alan Aurthur]] and Fosse, is a [[autobiographical novel|semi-autobiographical]] [[fantasy]] based on aspects of Fosse's life and career as a dancer, choreographer and director. The film was inspired by Fosse's manic effort to edit his film ''[[Lenny (film)|Lenny]]'' while simultaneously staging the 1975 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''. It borrows its title from the [[Kander and Ebb]] tune "[[All That Jazz (song)|All That Jazz]]" in that production. The film won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1980 Cannes Film Festival]].

In 2001, ''All That Jazz'' was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the United States [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1833/year/1980.html|title=ALL THAT JAZZ|publisher=[[Cannes Film Festival]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Joe Gideon is a theater director and choreographer trying to balance staging his latest Broadway musical with editing a Hollywood film he has directed. He is a workaholic who chain-smokes cigarettes; without a daily dose of [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], [[Visine]], [[Alka-Seltzer]], [[Dextroamphetamine|Dexedrine]], and [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], he wouldn't have the energy to keep up the biggest "show" of all—his life. His girlfriend Katie Jagger, his ex-wife Audrey Paris, and daughter Michelle try to pull him back from the brink, but it is too late for his exhausted body and stress-ravaged heart. In his imagination, he flirts with an [[Death (personification)|angel of death]] named Angelique.

Gideon's condition gets progressively worse. He is rushed to a hospital after experiencing chest pains during a particularly stressful [[Read-through|table-read]] (with the production's penny-pinching backers in attendance) and is admitted with severe [[Angina pectoris|angina]]. Joe brushes off his symptoms, and attempts to leave to go back to rehearsal. He collapses in the doctor's office, and is ordered to stay in the hospital for several weeks to rest his heart and recover from his exhaustion. The show is postponed, but Gideon continues his antics from the hospital bed, in brazen denial of his mortality. Champagne flows, endless strings of women frolic around his hospital room, and cigarettes are constantly being smoked. As cardiogram readings show no improvement, Gideon dances with death. A negative review for his film—which has been released without him—comes in, and Gideon has a massive coronary event. He undergoes [[coronary artery bypass surgery]].

The show's backers must decide whether it's time to pack up, or replace Gideon as the director. Their matter-of-fact, money-oriented negotiations with the insurers are juxtaposed with graphic scenes of Joe's [[Cardiac surgery|open-heart surgery]]. The producers realize that the best way to recoup their money and make a profit is to bet on Gideon dying: the insurance proceeds would result in a profit of over half a million dollars. Meanwhile, elements from Gideon's past life are staged in dazzling dream sequences of musical numbers he directs from his hospital bed while on life support. Realizing death is imminent and his mortality unconquerable, Gideon has another heart attack. In the film's glittery finale, he goes through the [[five stages of grief]]—anger, denial, bargaining, depression and acceptance—featured in the stand-up routine he had been editing. As death closes in on Gideon, his fantasy episodes become more hallucinatory and extravagant. In an epilogue set up as a monumental [[variety show]] featuring everyone from his past, Gideon takes center stage.

The final shot shows his corpse being zipped up in a [[body bag]].

==Production==
With increasing production costs and a loss of enthusiasm for the film, [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] brought in [[20th Century-Fox|Fox]] to finance completion, who acquired domestic distribution rights in return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Daily Variety]]|title='Kramer' Wins Five-Oscar Judgment|date=April 15, 1980|page=1|last=Harwood|first=Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's structure is often compared to [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[8½]]'', another thinly veiled autobiographical film with fantastic elements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9803E2DF1538E732A25753C2A9649D946890D6CF Vincent Canby in ''The New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/content/node/7299 DVD review in ''The Onion: A.V. Club''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926223116/http://www.avclub.com/content/node/7299 |date=2007-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leonard Maltin page 26"&gt;"Leonard Maltin's 2009 Movie Guide" page 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The part of Audrey Paris—Joe's ex-wife and continuing muse, played by [[Leland Palmer (actress)|Leland Palmer]]—closely reflects that of Fosse's wife, the dancer and actress [[Gwen Verdon]], who continued to work with him on projects including ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' and ''All That Jazz'' itself.

Gideon's rough handling of chorus girl Victoria Porter closely resembles [[Bob Fosse]]'s own treatment of Jennifer Nairn-Smith during rehearsals for ''[[Pippin (musical)|Pippin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''All His Jazz: The Life &amp; Death of Bob Fosse'' by Martin Gottfried, Da Capo Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Nairn-Smith herself appears in the film as Jennifer, one of the ''NY/LA'' dancers.

[[Ann Reinking]] was one of Fosse's sexual partners at the time and was more or less playing herself in the film, but nonetheless she was required to audition for the role as Gideon's girlfriend, Kate Jagger.

[[Cliff Gorman]] was cast in the titular role of ''The Stand-Up''—the film-within-a-film version of ''[[Lenny (film)|Lenny]]''—after having played the role of Lenny Bruce in the original theatrical production of the show (for which he won a [[Tony Award]]), but was passed over for Fosse's film version of the production in favor of [[Dustin Hoffman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink1=Robert Simonson |last1=Simonson |first1=Robert |title=Cliff Gorman, Broadway's Lenny, Is Dead at 65 |url=http://www.playbill.com/article/cliff-gorman-broadways-lenny-is-dead-at-65-com-108241 |website=Playbill.com |publisher=Playbill, Inc. |accessdate=19 July 2018 |date=13 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Reviews were largely positive. ''All That Jazz'' scores an 86% "Fresh" (or "good") rating on [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 36 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|all_that_jazz|All That Jazz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Vincent Canby]] called the film "an uproarious display of brilliance, nerve, dance, maudlin confessions, inside jokes and, especially, ego" and "an essentially funny movie that seeks to operate on too many levels at the same time... some of it makes you wince, but a lot of it is great fun... A key to the success of the production is the performance of Roy Scheider as Joe Gideon... With an actor of less weight and intensity, ''All That Jazz'' might have evaporated as we watched it. Mr. Scheider's is a presence to reckon with."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9803E2DF1538E732A25753C2A9649D946890D6CF ''The New York Times'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described it as "a self-important, [[egomania]]cal, wonderfully choreographed, often compelling film" and added, "Roy Scheider gives a superb performance as Gideon, creating a character filled with nervous energy… The film's major flaw lies in its lack of real explanation of what, beyond ego, really motivates [him]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117796599.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 ''Variety'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[TV Guide]]'' said, "The dancing is frenzied, the dialogue piercing, the photography superb, and the acting first-rate, with non-showman Scheider an illustrious example of casting against type . . . ''All That Jazz'' is great-looking but not easy to watch. Fosse's indulgent vision at times approaches sour self-loathing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/movies/jazz/review/111363 ''TV Guide'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film two-and-a-half stars (out of four) in his 2009 movie guide; he said that the film was "self-indulgent and largely negative," and that "great show biz moments and wonderful dancing are eventually buried in pretensions"; he also called the ending "an interminable finale which leaves a bad taste for the whole film."&lt;ref name="Leonard Maltin page 26" /&gt;

''[[Time Out London]]'' states, "As translated onto screen, [Fosse's] story is wretched: the jokes are relentlessly crass and objectionable; the song 'n' dance routines have been created in the cutting-room and have lost any sense of fun; [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]]-esque moments add little but pretension; and scenes of a real open-heart operation, alternating with footage of a symbolic Angel of Death in veil and white gloves, fail even in terms of the surreal."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/77740/All_That_Jazz.html ''Time Out London'' review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507033352/http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/77740/All_That_Jazz.html |date=2008-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon release in 1979, director [[Stanley Kubrick]], who is mentioned in the movie, reportedly called it "[the] best film I think I have ever seen".{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=12}}
In 2001, ''All That Jazz'' was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. It was also preserved by the [[Academy Film Archive]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preserved Projects|url=http://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=All+That+Jazz&amp;filmmaker=&amp;category=All&amp;collection=All|website=Academy Film Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the film was ranked #14 by the [[American Film Institute]] on its list of the [[AFI's 100 Years of Musicals|Greatest Movie Musicals]].

The film would be the last musical nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] until Disney's ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' in 1991, and was the last live-action musical to compete in the category until [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' was nominated over twenty years later.

*Stamatis, ''Six Sigma and Beyond: Design for Six Sigma, Volume VI'', CRC Press, 2002, {{ISBN|1-57444-315-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, functional requirements (FRs) are related to design parameters (DPs):
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} FR_1 \\ FR_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} A_{11} &amp; A_{12} \\ A_{21} &amp; A_{22} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} DP_1 \\ DP_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The method gets its name from its use of design principles or design [[Axioms]] (i.e., given without proof) governing the analysis and [[decision making process]] in developing high quality product or system designs.  The two axioms used in Axiomatic Design (AD) are:

* Axiom 1: '''The Independence Axiom'''.  Maintain the independence of the functional requirements (FRs).
* Axiom 2: '''The Information Axiom'''.  Minimize the information content of the design.

Axiomatic design is considered to be a design method that addresses fundamental issues in [[Taguchi methods]].

The methodology was developed by Dr. [[Suh Nam Pyo]] at MIT, Department of Mechanical Engineering since the 1990s. A series of academic conferences have been held to present current developments of the methodology. The most recent International Conference on Axiomatic Design (ICAD) was the 11th ICAD hosted in Romania in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icad.tcm.cmmi.tuiasi.ro/|title=11th ICAD|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FDA Bldg 51 - Main Entrance (5161374834).jpg|thumb|FDA Building 51 houses the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.]]
'''The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research''' ('''CDER''', pronounced "see'-der") is a division of the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) that monitors most drugs as defined in the [[Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]].  Some biological products are also legally considered drugs, but they are covered by the [[Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research]].  The center reviews applications for brand name, generic, and over the counter pharmaceuticals, manages US [[current Good Manufacturing Practice]] (cGMP) regulations for pharmaceutical manufacturing, determines which medications require a [[medical prescription]], monitors advertising of approved medications, and collects and analyzes safety data about pharmaceuticals that are already on the market.

CDER receives considerable public scrutiny, and thus implements processes that tend toward objectivity and tend to isolate decisions from being attributed to specific individuals. The decisions on approval will often make or break a small company's stock price{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} (e.g., [[Martha Stewart]] and [[Imclone]]), so the markets closely watch CDER's decisions.

The center has around 1,300 employees in "review teams" that evaluate and approve new drugs. Additionally, the CDER employs a "safety team" with 72 employees to determine whether new drugs are unsafe or present risks not disclosed in the product's labeling.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The FDA's budget for approving, labeling, and monitoring drugs is roughly $290 million per year{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}. The safety team monitors the effects of more than 3,000 prescription drugs on 200 million people with a budget of about $15 million a year{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}. 

[[Janet Woodcock]] is the director of CDER.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ContactCDER/UCM070722.pdf|title=U.S. FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Key Officials|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibilities ==
CDER reviews [[New Drug Applications]] to ensure that the drugs are safe and effective. Its primary objective is to ensure that all [[prescription drug|prescription]] and [[Over-the-counter substance|over-the-counter]] (OTC) medications are safe and effective when used as directed.

The FDA requires a four phased series of [[clinical trials]] for testing drugs. Phase I involves testing new drugs on healthy volunteers in small groups to determine the maximum safe dosage. Phase II trials involve patients with the condition the drug is intended to treat to test for safety and minimal efficacy in a somewhat larger group of people. Phase III trials involve one to five thousand patients to determine whether the drug is effective in treating the condition it is intended to be used for. After this stage, a new drug application is submitted. If the drug is approved, stage IV trials are conducted after marketing to ensure there are no adverse effects or long term effects of the drug that were not previously discovered. 

With the rapid advancement of biologically-derived treatments, the FDA has stated that it is working to modernize the process of approval for new drugs. In 2017, Commissioner [[Scott Gottlieb]] estimated that they have more than 600 active applications for gene and cell based therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/fda-modernizing-evaluations-as-gene-cell-therapy-fields-grow-1504802513|title=FDA Modernizing Evaluations as Gene, Cell Therapy Fields Grow|first=Thomas M.|last=Burton|date=7 September 2017|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Divisions ==
CDER is divided into 8 sections with different responsibilities:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OrganizationCharts/UCM439876.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDER/ucm075128.htm|title=About the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research - CDER Offices and Divisions|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|last=Research|website=www.fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Office of New Drugs
:: This office is responsible for oversight of clinical trials and other studies during drug development, and for the evaluation of new drug applications
:: The Office of New Drugs is divided into several departments based on the indication of the drug (the medical need for which it is being proposed)
* Office of Generic Drugs
:: This office reviews generic drug applications to ensure generic drugs are equivalent to their branded forms
* Office of Strategic Programs
:: This office is responsible for business programs, represents CDER in the FDA Bioinformatics Board, and communicates with other agencies 
* Office of Pharmaceutical Quality
:: This office is responsible for testing drugs and biotechnology products for safety and manufacturing 
* Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology
:: This office is responsible for post-marketing surveillance to identify adverse effects that may not have been apparent during clinical trials, using the [[MedWatch]] program
* Office of Translational Sciences
:: This office promotes collaboration across offices in CDER by maintaining databases and biostatistical tools for evaluating drugs
* Office of Medical and Regulatory Policy
:: This office develops and reviews guidelines pertinent to CDER's mission of ensuring the safety of drugs
* Office of Compliance
:: This office ensures compliance with regulations relating to drug development and marketing

==History==
The FDA has had the responsibility of reviewing drugs since the passage of the 1906 [[Pure Food and Drugs Act]]. The 1938 [[Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act]] required all new drugs to be tested before marketing by submitting the original form of the new drug application. Within the first year, the FDA's Drug Division, the predecessor to CDER, received over 1200 applications. The [[Drug Amendments of 1962]] required manufacturers to prove to the FDA that the drug in question was both safe and effective. In 1966, the division was reorganized to create the Office of New Drugs, which was responsible for reviewing new drug applications and clinical testing of drugs.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research|url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/FOrgsHistory/CDER/ucm325199.htm|website=US FDA|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, when the beginning of the [[biotechnology revolution]] blurred the line between a drug and a [[biologic medical product|biologic]], the Bureau of Drugs was merged with the FDA's [[Bureau of Biologics]] to form the ''National Center for Drugs and Biologics'' during an agency-wide reorganization under Commissioner [[Arthur Hayes]].&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  This reorganization similarly merged the bureaus responsible for medical devices and radiation control into the [[Center for Devices and Radiological Health]].

In 1987, under Commissioner [[Frank Edward Young (physician)|Frank Young]], CDER and the [[Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research]] (CBER) were split into their present form.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  The two groups were charged with enforcing different laws and had significantly different philosophical and cultural differences.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  At that time, CDER was more cautious about approving therapeutics and had a more adversarial relationship with the industry.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  The growing crisis around [[HIV]] testing and treatment and an inter-agency dispute between officials from the former Bureau of Drugs and officials from the former Bureau of Biologics over whether to approve Genentech's Activase ([[tissue plasminogen activator]]) led to the split.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

In its original form, CDER was composed of six offices: Management, Compliance, Drug Standards, Drug Evaluation I, Drug Evaluation II, Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and Research Resources. The Division of Antiviral Products was added in 1989 under Drug Evaluation II due to the large amount of drugs proposed for treating AIDS.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; The Office of Generic Drugs was also formed.

In 2002, the FDA transferred a number of biologically produced therapeutics to CDER.&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;Reid, Ken. "CBER and CDER have long history of being lumped together and split up." ''Bioresearch Monitoring Alert'' Sept. 2002. page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; These include [[therapeutic monoclonal antibodies]], proteins intended for therapeutic use, [[immunomodulator]]s, and [[growth factors]] and other products designed to alter production of blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDER/ucm197608.htm|title=About the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research - Drug Application and Approval Process -|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|last=Research|website=www.fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Goya - Que viene el coco (Here Comes the Bogey-Man).jpg|thumb|right|''Que Viene el Coco'' (1799) by [[Goya]]]]
The '''Coco''' (or '''Cuco''', '''Coca''', '''Cuca''', '''Cucuy''', '''Cucuí''')  is a mythical [[ghost]]-[[monster]], equivalent to the [[bogeyman]], found in many [[Hispanophone]] and [[Lusophone]] countries. He can also be considered a Latino version of a [[bugbear]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aNY3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=coco+Bugbear&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=coco%20Bugbear&amp;f=false The Year's Work in Modern Languages Study pg 175]&lt;/ref&gt; as it is a commonly used figure of speech representing an irrational or exaggerated fear. The Coco is a male being while Coca is the female version of the mythical [[monster]], although it is not possible to distinguish one from the other as both are the representation of the same being.

==Names and etymology==
The myth of the ''Coco'' originated in [[Portugal]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. According to the [[Real Academia Española]], the word ''coco'' derives from the Galician and Portuguese ''côco'' {{IPA-pt|ˈko.ku|}}, which referred to a ghost with a pumpkin head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://buscon.rae.es/drae/?type=3&amp;val=coco "Coco".] ''Diccionario de la lengua española.'' Real Academia Española. Retrieved 26 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''coco'' is used in colloquial speech to refer to the human head in Portuguese and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pyylwqkVIUoC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=coco+cabe%C3%A7a++head&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false A Portuguese-English dictionary pg 164]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Coco'' also means "skull".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aDhGlKL3h00C&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=coco+skull&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=coco%20skull&amp;f=false The concise dictionary of English etymology pg 91]&lt;/ref&gt; The word "cocuruto" in Portuguese means the crown of the head and the highest place.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yQktAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT155&amp;dq=dicionario+coco+cabe%C3%A7a&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false A dictionary of the Portuguese and English languages, in two parts]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Basque language|Basque]], ''Gogo'' means "[[spirit]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.euskadi.net/morris/resultado.asp Morris Student Plus] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616160420/http://www1.euskadi.net/morris/resultado.asp |date=June 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://projetbabel.org/basque/diccionario.php?q=gogo Diccionario etimológico vasco-español-francés]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Latin American countries refer to the monster as ''el Cuco''. In Northern [[New Mexico]] and Southern [[Colorado]], where there is a large Hispanic population, it is referred to by its anglicized name, "the Coco Man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castro|first=Rafaela|authorlink=Rafaela Castro|title=Chicano Folklore: A Guide to the Folktales, Traditions, Rituals and Religious Practices of Mexican Americans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v72wKX9I6lgC&amp;pg=PA57|year=2000|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=978-0-19-514639-4|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Brazilian folklore, the monster is referred to as ''Cuca'' and pictured as a female humanoid [[alligator]], derived from the Portuguese ''coca'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.correiodamanha.pt/noticia.aspx?contentID=614462EB-F2A5-498E-A2F6-6BCDC2D63DF6&amp;channelID=00000010-0000-0000-0000-000000000010]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[dragon]].

==Legend==
In Spain, Portugal, and Latin America (including Brazil), parents sometimes invoke the Coco as a way of discouraging their children from misbehaving; they sing lullabies or tell rhymes warning their children that if they don't obey their parents, ''el Coco''  will come and get them and then eat them.

It is not the way the Coco looks but what he does that scares most. It is a child eater and a kidnapper; it may immediately devour the child, leaving no trace, or it may [[spirit away|spirit the child away]] to a place of no return, but it only does this to disobedient children. The coca is on the look out for child's misbehavior on the top of the roof, the coco takes the shape of any dark shadow and stays watching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alonsoquijano.org/cursos2004/animateca/recursos/Biblioteca%20virtual/C1.%20Tradiciones%20y%20Literatura%20Infantil/17.%20Eloy%20Martos.pdf |title=LA IMAGEN DEL JOVEN A TRAVÉS DE LAS FICCIONES DE TERROR Y SUS FUENTES FOLKLÓRICO-LITERARIAS.

Others see the Coco as a representation of the deceased of the local community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Viana|first=Luis Díaz|authorlink=Luis Díaz Viana|title=Aproximación antropológica a Castilla y León|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EIerX9EVf58C&amp;pg=PA500|year=1988|publisher=Anthropos Editorial|isbn=978-84-7658-070-7|page=500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known rhyme about the Coco, which originated in the 17th century, is in the ''Auto de los desposorios de la Virgen'' by Juan Caxés.

The rhyme has evolved over the years, but still retains its original meaning:
{{Verse translation|
Duérmete niño, duérmete ya...
Que viene el Coco y te comerá.
|
Sleep child, sleep now...
The Coco is coming and will eat you soon.
}}

The Portuguese lullaby recorded by [[José Leite de Vasconcelos]] tells Coca to go to the top of the roof. In other versions of the same lullaby, the name of coca is changed to that of "papão negro" (black eater) the name of another boogyman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cvc.instituto-camoes.pt/bdc/etnologia/revistalusitana/10/lusitana10_pag_1.pdf leite de Vasconcelos,José.

{{Verse translation|
Vai-te Coca. Vai-te Coca
Para cima do telhado
Deixa o menino dormir
Um soninho descansado
|
Leave Coca. Leave Coca
Go to the top of the roof
Let the child have

}}

The traditional Brazilian lullaby is as follows:
{{Verse translation|
Dorme neném
Que a Cuca vem pegar
Papai foi na roça
Mamãe foi passear
|
Sleep baby
Or the Cuca will catch you
Daddy went to the farm
Mommy went out
}}

Brazilians also have the boogeyman version, that sometimes acquires regional colors where the Bogeyman (shape-shifting ''Bicho Papão'' is a monster that is shaped by what the child fears most) is a small owl, ''murucututu'', or other birds of prey that could be on the roof of homes at night.
{{Verse translation|

Verses and songs were used in pre-Roman Iberia to transmit history to the younger generations, has told by ancient authors. Sallust said the mothers sang the military feats of the fathers to incite the children to battle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attalus.org/latin/sallust2.html#75 Sallustius, Historiae 2, fragment 75]&lt;/ref&gt; He was later quoted by Servius who emphasised that it was the role of the mothers to remembered and teach the young men about the war feats of their fathers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monumenta.ch/latein/text.php?tabelle=Servius&amp;rumpfid=Servius,%20in%20Vergilii%20Aeneidos%20Commentarius,%2010,%20%20281&amp;nf=1 Servius, in Vergilii Aeneidos Commentarius, 10, Versus 281]&lt;/ref&gt; Silus Italicus added more, he said that the young warriors sang songs in their native language while hitting their shields in the rhythm of the songs and that they were well versed in magic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hoppe/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0674%3Abook%3D3 Silius Italicus, Punica, book III, verse 34]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strabo too, commented that history was recorded in verse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239%3Abook%3D3 Strabo, Geography BOOK III. CHAPTER I,7]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Portuguese and Spanish colonization of Latin America, the legend of the Coco was spread to countries such as [[Mexico]], [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]].

There is no general description of the ''cucuy'', as far as [[Face|facial]] or [[Human body|body]] descriptions, but it is stated that this [[shapeshifting]] being is extremely horrible to look at. The ''coco'' is variously described as a shapeless figure, sometimes a hairy monster, that hides in closets or under beds and eats children that misbehave when they are told to go to bed.

===Mythical animals===

Coca is a female [[dragon]] that in medieval times, in the Iberian Peninsula, used to take part in different celebrations. In Portugal one still survives in [[Monção]] and she fights in some sort of medieval tournament with [[saint George]] during the [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] celebrations. She is called "Santa Coca" (Saint Coca), an allusion to the Irish saint,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kildare.ie/ehistory/2006/09/kilcock_parish_of_comerfords_d.asp KILCOCK, PARISH OF - Comerford's "Dioceses of Kildare and Leighlin]&lt;/ref&gt; or "Coca rabicha" ([[Tail]]ed Coca). If she defeats [[Saint George]], by scaring the horse, there will be a bad year for the crops and famine, if the horse and Saint George win by cutting off one of her ears with earring and her tongue, the crops will be fertile.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1258208 the feast of santiago in Galicia 1956.

The legend says that the dragon arrived from the sea and was devouring the young women and was killed in combat by the young men
of the city. In Monção, the legend says, she lives in the [[Minho (river)|Minho]]; in Redondela she lives in the [[Ria]] of [[Vigo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodríguez Adrados|first=Francisco|authorlink=Francisco Rodríguez Adrados|title=Festival, Comedy and Tragedy: The Greek Origins of Theatre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AtcUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA380|year=1975|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=90-04-04313-6|page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dragon shared the same name that was given in Portuguese and Spanish to the [[Cog (ship)|Cog]], and although used mainly for trade it was also a war vessel common in [[medieval warfare]] and piracy raids to coastal villages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://estudiosmedievales.revistas.csic.es/index.php/estudiosmedievales/article/viewArticle/72 La coca en el intercambio mercante Atlántico-Mediterráneo] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fotevikensmuseum.se/fotenet/koggarna/visby2011 Visbyresan 2011 med koggen Tvekamp av Elbogen] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111121750/http://www.fotevikensmuseum.se/fotenet/koggarna/visby2011 |date=2012-11-11 }}.

The oldest reference to Coca is in the book ''Livro 3 de Doações de D. [[Afonso III]]'' from the year 1274, where it is referred to as a big fish that appears on the [[shore]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://cvc.instituto-camoes.pt/bdc/etnologia/revistalusitana/04/lusitana04_pag_285.pdf d'Azevedo, Pedro.

In [[Catalonia]] the "Cuca fera de Tortosa" was first documented in 1457. It is a [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphic]] figure, looks like a [[tortoise]] with a horned spine, it has dragon claws and a dragon head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alemany|first1=Rafael|authorlink1=Rafael Alemany|last2=Ferrando i Francés|first2=Antoni|authorlink2=Antoni Ferrando i Francés|last3=Meseguer i Pallarés|first3=Lluís|authorlink3=Lluís Meseguer i Pallarés|title=Actes del novè Col·loqui Internacional de Llengua i Literatura Catalanes: Alicant-Elx, 9-14 de setembre de 1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1kOtXqGVbCwC&amp;pg=PA160|year=1993|publisher=L'Abadia de Montserrat|isbn=978-84-7826-465-0|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farb Hernandez|first=Jo|authorlink=Jo Farb Hernandez|title=Forms of Tradition in Contemporary Spain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bgsq2W1hxr4C&amp;pg=PA95|year=2005|publisher=Univ.

The legend of the Coca can be compared to the one of [[Peluda]] or [[Tarasque]].

In [[Brazil]] the Coco appears as a female alligator called ''Cuca''. Cuca appears as the villain in some children's books by [[Monteiro Lobato]]. Artists illustrating these books depicted the Cuca as an anthropomorphic alligator. She is an allusion to ''Coca'', a dragon from the folklore of Portugal and Galicia.

Traditionally in Portugal, however, the ''coco'' is represented by an iron pan with holes, to represent a face, with a light in the inside or by a carved vegetable lantern made from a pumpkin with two eyes and a mouth, that is left in dark places with a light inside to scare people.&lt;ref&gt;Figueiredo, Cândido. ''Pequeno Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa''. Livraria Bertrand. Lisboa 1940&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Beira (Portugal)|Beiras]], heads carved on pumpkins, called "coca", would be carried, by the village boys, stuck on top of wooden stakes.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The same name [Coca] is given to the pumpkin perforated with the shape of a face, with a candle burning in the inside—this gives the idea of a skull on fire—that the boys on many lands of our [[Beira Alta Province|Beira]] carry stuck on a stick.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?um=1&amp;q=vela+acesa+no+interior+%E2%80%94+o+que+d%C3%A1+ideia+de+uma+caveira+a+arder&amp;btnG=Search+Books Beira Alta - Assembleia Distrital de Viseu, Junta de Província da Beira Alta, Arquivo Provincial (Beira Alta, Portugal), Junta Distrital de Viseu, Arquivo Distrital (Viseu, Portugal) - Beira Alta (Portugal) - 1946. p. 296] {{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An analogous custom was first mentioned by [[Diodorus Siculus]] (XIII.56.5;57.3), in which [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] warriors, after the battle of [[Selinunte]], in 469 BC, would hang the heads of the enemies on their [[spear]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/FichaObra.html?Ref=30875&amp;portal=33 La creencia en la ultratumba en la Hispania romana a través de sus monumentos pg 4]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rafael López Loureiro, this carving representation would be a milenar tradition from the [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] region that spread all over the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andelvirtual.com/tev/catalogo/ver.php?pid=7288 Samaín: A Festa das Caliveras]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lavoz.es/ferrol/2007/11/04/0003_6288179.htm O Samaín é una tradizón moi estendida pola Península Ibérica]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The autumnal and childish custom of emptying pumpkins and carving on its [[bark (botany)|bark]], eyes, nose and mouth looking for a sombre expression, far from being a tradition imported by a recent Americanizing cultural mimicry, is a cultural trait in ancient Iberian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ortegalia.es/pdf/Pasado%20y%20presente%20de%20los%20estudios%20celtas.pdf Pasado y presente de los estudios Celtas.

This representation would be related to the Celtic cult of the severed heads in the [[Iberian peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccpxaquinlorenzo.es/index.php?option=com_phocadownload&amp;view=category&amp;download=50%3Ao-samain&amp;id=5%3Apropostas-pedagoxicas&amp;Itemid=37&amp;lang=gl As caveiras de colondros e o tempo de Samaín pg 6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucm.es/BUCM/revistas/ghi/02130181/articulos/GERI8787110245A.PDF Las «cabezas cortadas» en la Península Ibérica]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[João de Barros]], the name of the "[[coconut]]" derived from "coco" and was given to the fruit by the sailors of [[Vasco da Gama]], c.1498, because it reminded them of this mythical creature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RxGv6tMX2QcC&amp;pg=PT481&amp;dq=coco+fantasma+portugueses&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3 La tribuna del idioma. pg 481]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pg5PhDt9KtoC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=coco+Bugbear+barros&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=coco%20Bugbear%20barros&amp;f=false Portuguese Vocables in Asiatic Languages pp. 109-111]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This bark from which the [[pome]] receives its vegetable nourishment, which is through its [[Plant stem|stem]], has an acute way, which wants to resemble a nose  placed between two round eyes, from where it throws the [[Sprouting|sprout]], when it wants to be born; by reason of such figure, it was called by our [men] [[coconut|coco]], name imposed by the women on anything they want to put fear to the children, this name thus remained, as no one knows another.&lt;ref&gt;Barros, João de.

[[Rafael Bluteau]] (1712), defines that the coco and coca were thought to look like skulls, in Portugal:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Coco or Coca. We make use of these words to frighten children, because the inner shell of the Coco has on its outside surface three holes giving it the appearance of a skull&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zOufgbY8TbsC&amp;dq=dalgado+glossario&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4#v=snippet&amp;q=coca&amp;f=false Dalgado, Sebastião. Glossário luso-asiático, Volume 1 . 291]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the first half of the 20th century the coca was an integral part of festivities like [[All Souls' Day]] and the ritual begging of [[Pão-por-Deus]]. The tradition of Pão-por-Deus, already mentioned in the 15th century,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZrUGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA265&amp;dq=dia+dos+fieis+defuntos&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s3mSUMXYGs-RhQf7pICAAQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=dia%20dos%20fieis%20defuntos&amp;f=false Elucidario das palavras, termos e frases, que em Portugal antigamente se usárão..., Volume 1]&lt;/ref&gt; is a ritual begging for bread and cakes, done door to door by children, though in the past poor beggers would also take part. Its purpose is to share the bread or treats gathered door to door with the dear little souls, the dead of the community who were eagerly awaited and arrived at night in the shape of butterflies or little animals, during the traditional [[Castanyada|magusto]].&lt;ref&gt;[Ernesto Veiga de Oliveira.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this same city of [[Coimbra]], where we find ourselves today, it is customary for groups of children to walk on the streets, on the 31st October and 1st and 2nd November, at nightfall, with a hollow pumpkin with holes that were cut out pretending to be eyes, nose and mouth, as if it was a skull, and with a stump of candle lit from within, to give it a more macabre look.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel de Paiva Boléo, Universidade de Coimbra.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In Coimbra the begging mentions "[[Pão-por-Deus|Bolinhos, bolinhós]]" and the group brings an emptied pumpkin with two holes representing the eyes of a personage and a candle lit in the inside [...] another example of the use of the pumpkin or gourd as a human representation, is in the masks of the muffled young men during the desfolhada, the communal stripping of the maize, in Santo Tirso de Prazins ([[Guimarães]]), which after, they carry  hoisted on a stick and with a candle in the inside, and leave them stuck on any deserted place to put fear to who is passing by.&lt;ref&gt;Renato Almeida, Jorge Dias.

To ensure that the souls don't get astray and find their way back home the "Botador de almas", whose mission was to lay souls (botar almas), would go every night through valleys and mountains and up on trees ringing his little bell or carrying a lantern and singing a pray to the souls. Every Portuguese village had one. But calling and singing to the souls is an ancient tradition done either by one person alone or in groups and it also has many names: "lançar as almas", "encomendar as almas", "amentar as almas", "deitar as almas", "cantar às almas santas".&lt;ref&gt;[https://correiodaguarda.blogs.sapo.pt/211413.html Correio da Guarda.

The muffled young men, called serandeiros, are disguised young men, covered with a blanket, bed sheet or with a hooded cloak. They carry around a [[Walking stick|staff]], a stick of [[quince]] or of [[Celtis australis|honeyberry]], about their own height in one hand, on the other they carry a small bundle of [[basil]] or apples that they make the girls that take part of the desfolhada smell, or tickle the cheeks of the people, and sometimes, to play a prank, they bring [[Urtica dioica|stinging nettles]].

===Our Ladies===
The rituals in the [[Catholic]] religious order of [[Our Lady of Cabeza]], a [[Black Madonna]], in Portugal include the offering of heads of wax to the Lady, praying the [[Hail Mary]] while keeping a small statue of Our Lady on top of the head, and the [[pilgrims]] praying with their own heads inside a hole made on the wall of the chapel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UW77i2A_xSQC&amp;pg=PA448&amp;dq=%22senhora+da+cabe%C3%A7a%22+cabe%C3%A7a&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AfgCUO-BA6mC4gSUy_2XCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22senhora%20da%20cabe%C3%A7a%22%20cabe%C3%A7a&amp;f=false Enciclopédia das Festas Populares e Religiosas de Portugal - Volume 1, pg448]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Chapel of Our Lady of the Heads (Nossa Senhora das Cabeças) placed 50&amp;nbsp;m (164&amp;nbsp;ft) NW of the ruins of the Roman era temple of Our Lady of the Heads (Orjais, [[Covilhã]]) evidences a continuity in the use of a sacred space that changed from a pagan worship cult area to a Christian one and continued to be a place of worship for centuries after.

The Lady of the Head and Lady of the Heads are two of the many names given to Our Lady. Several of her names are thought to be of pre-Roman origin. Names like Senhora da Noite, (Lady of the Night),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agencia.ecclesia.pt/noticias/nacional/habitantes-de-aldeia-nova-cumpriram-tradicao-da-senhora-da-noite/ Habitantes de Aldeia Nova cumpriram tradição da Senhora da Noite]&lt;/ref&gt; Senhora da Luz (Lady of the Light), Señora de Carbayo (Lady of the Oak tree)are spread all over the peninsula. In Portugal alone were collected 972 titles for Our Lady in churches, altars and images not including the names of villages and places.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/2061.pdf A DEVOÇÂO DO POVO PORTUGUÊS A NOSSA SENHORA NOS TEMPOS MODERNOS]&lt;/ref&gt; Spain will also have an equivalent amount of titles for Our Lady.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/3278427.pdf Flora y Religiosidad popular: advocaciones vegetales de los Crucificados en España y América]&lt;/ref&gt;

The common element to all these names is the title Lady. But the title Senhora (pt.),Señora (Sp.) is of Latin origin, and derives from lat. senior,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lema.rae.es/drae/srv/search?id=HrhNNZqKHDXX28hPXTEm Diccionario de la lengua española]&lt;/ref&gt; thus there had to be another one of pre-Roman origin. In ancient times the titles that were used in Portugal by the ladies of the court were Meana (me Ana) or Miana (mi Ana) and Meona (me Ona)  these words meant the same as miLady, that is, Ana and Ona were synonys of Senhora and [[Don (honorific)|Dona]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bIdFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=palavras+que+antigamente+senhora&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=F23xUNn-OoqXhQf4-oCQCg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&amp;q=miona&amp;f=false Elucidário das palavras, termos e frases, que em Portugal antigamente se diziam, Volume2]&lt;/ref&gt; Ana is the name of the river [[Guadiana]] thus pre-Roman in origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/3B*.html Strabo Geography Book III, Chapter 2]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anu (deity)|Ana]] is also the name of a goddess of the Irish mythology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&amp;pg=PA1452&amp;dq=ANA+CELTIC++ETYMOLOGY&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kn7_VNLQCcOqU-TLgJgN&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwBw#v=snippet&amp;q=anu&amp;f=false Celtic Culture: Aberdeen breviary-celticism pg 77-78]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the village of Ponte, parish of Mouçós, on a hill that overlooks River Corgo, there is a chapel called santo Cabeço which legend says was built by the mouros encantados. On the wall facing south there is a hole where legend says the mouros used to put their head to hear the sound of the sea. The local people also have the custom of putting their head inside the hole: some to hear the whisper that is similar to the waves of the sea, others to heal the headaches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lendarium.org/narrative/a-capela-de-n-s-a-de-guadalupe/ A Capela de N.

In the travels of the Baron Rozmital, 1465-1467, it was written a paragraph commenting the traditional mourning clothes of the Portuguese of that time.

'''''Creatures''''' is an [[artificial life]] (alife) [[computer program]] series, created in the mid-1990s by English [[computer science|computer scientist]] [[Steve Grand (roboticist)|Steve Grand]] whilst working for the [[Cambridge]] [[video game]]s developer [[Millennium Interactive]]. Gameplay focuses on raising alien creatures known as Norns, teaching them to survive, helping them explore their world, defending them against other species, and breeding them. Words can be taught to creatures by a learning computer (for verbs) or by repeating the name of the object while the creature is looking at it. After a creature understands language, the player can instruct their creature by typing in instructions, which the creature may choose to obey.  A complete life cycle is modelled for the creatures - childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and senescence, each with their own particular needs.  The gameplay is designed to foster an emotional bond between the player and their creatures.  Rather than taking a scripted approach, Creatures series games were driven by detailed biological and neurological simulation and their unexpected results. There were six major Creatures releases from Creature Labs. Between 1996 and 2001, there were three principal games released, the Docking Station add-on (generally referenced as a separate game) and two children's games, and there were three games created for console systems.  A sequel named ''Creatures Online'' was in development, with the artificial life technology from Creatures 3 and Docking Station updated to a 3D environment.

The [[genetics]] in ''Creatures'' are somewhat different from [[physical anthropology|human genetics]]; they are [[haploid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/creatures_genetics_preview_kit2.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980126091513/http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/creatures_genetics_preview_kit2.htm |archivedate=1998-01-26 |title=GENETICS PREVIEW KIT - REFERENCE GUIDE |publisher=Cyberlife |date=1998-01-26 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no concept of [[dominant gene]] and [[recessive gene]], much less [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] between [[locus (genetics)|loci]].

To create this kind of behaviour, Grand felt it was necessary to program the creatures by simulating the building blocks of nature in a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]] approach, allowing the complex behaviour to [[Emergence|emerge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grand|first=Steve|title=Human cognition and social agent technology|year=2000|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9027251398|page=350|editor=Dautenhahn, Kerstin|chapter=The Emergence of Personality: How to Create Souls from Cells}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than using a [[rule-based system]] approach.&lt;ref name="Dr.Frankenstein"/&gt;  Grand later wished to include references to an "English" or Norse mythology, to try to make the world more internally consistent,&lt;ref name=mainhistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fp.cyberlifersrch.plus.com/creaturesarchive/creatures_history.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028181218/http://fp.cyberlifersrch.plus.com/creaturesarchive/creatures_history.htm |archivedate=2008-10-28 |title=Creatures history |author=Grand, Steve |publisher=Cyberlife Research |date=2004-06-04 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mythography&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fp.cyberlifersrch.plus.com/creaturesarchive/mythography.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927203124/http://fp.cyberlifersrch.plus.com/creaturesarchive/mythography.htm |archivedate=2008-09-27 |title=Small Furry Creatures: A Mythography |publisher=Cyberlife Research |date=8 March 1993 |author=Grand, Steve |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but found that the team wanted to make the game into a conventional adventure game.&lt;ref name=rationale/&gt; He later decided to scale back on the mythology aspects of the game, focusing instead on the [[artificial life]] point - eventually presenting the game as an artificial [[animal fancy|pet hobby]], which provided some of the impetus to include genetics in the creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fp.cyberlifersrch.plus.com/creaturesarchive/pleasureprofit.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927203129/http://fp.cyberlifersrch.plus.com/creaturesarchive/pleasureprofit.htm |archivedate=2008-09-27 |author=Grand, Steve |title="Breeding Norns for Pleasure and Profit" — some thoughts |publisher=Cyberlife Research |date=1 June 1995 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Creatures'' was developed as a consumer product by [[Millennium Interactive|Millennium]], and was released by [[Mindscape Group|Mindscape]] in 1996. The program was instantly successful,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} and an [[online community]] of players soon formed, swapping Norns, creating new objects for Albia,&lt;ref name="Jepsen C2"/&gt; sharing tips on how to play the game and anecdotes about unexpected evolutionary changes that they had seen, and even creating new [[Selective breeding|breeds]] of Norn. At one point, the Creatures online community was the largest of its type.

In 1996, ''Creatures'' won an EMMA Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emma-foundation.org/prevWin.asp?section=1996 |title=1996 Winners |publisher=The International EMMA Awards |date=2000-11-21 |accessdate=2012-11-12 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010420074653/http://www.emma-foundation.org/prevWin.asp?section=1996 |archivedate=2001-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/cyberlife_awards2.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970607011020/http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/cyberlife_awards2.htm |archivedate=1997-06-07 |title=CREATURES WINS INTERNATIONAL EMMA AWARD |publisher=cyberlife.co.uk |date=1997-06-07 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on sales of 500,000 copies of ''Creatures'' from 1996 through to the second quarter of 1998, it was estimated that at that time, there was a possible global population of up to five million norns.&lt;ref name=TCGDE/&gt;

Development of ''[[Creatures 2]]'' began in Q3 1997.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra C2"/&gt;  In 1998, the video games division of [[Millennium Interactive|Millennium]] was sold to Sony Entertainment while those working on alife and ''Creatures'' formed a new company called Cyberlife Technology. Along with continued work on the ''Creatures'' titles, the company did work for industry and the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Defence]], famously attempting to teach live organisms to fly virtual [[fighter jet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/ns/980509/features.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990117012705/http://www.newscientist.com/ns/980509/features.html |archivedate=1999-01-17 |title=New Scientist Planet Science: Agents from Albia |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |date=1999-01-17 |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/class/sts145/Library/richard.pdf |title=Norn Attacks and Marine Doom |publisher= |author=BIRGIT RICHARD |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Creatures 2'' was nominated in the Artificial Intelligence category of the [[Game Developers Conference]]'s Spotlight Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creatures.co.uk/Newstand/newsletters/ns_news_stuff_current.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010211202533/http://www.creatures.co.uk/Newstand/newsletters/ns_news_stuff_current.htm |title=Stuff&amp;NORNsense |publisher=Creatures.co.uk |archivedate=2001-02-11 |accessdate=2013-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, Grand left Cyberlife to form Cyberlife Research and focus on the production of new alife technologies, including work on a [[robotics|robotic]] life form he called Lucy as well as writing books about his research. The remainder of the company was renamed Creature Labs, and focused on [[video game development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/creatures_more.php?id=17_0_6_0_M8 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517100548/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/creatures_more.php?id=17_0_6_0_M8 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-17 |title=Creature Labs |publisher=Gamewaredevelopment.com |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sequels to ''Creatures'', including ''Creatures 2'', ''[[Creatures 3]]'' and the small-children's games ''Creatures Adventures'' and ''Creatures Playground'', were released by Creature Labs in subsequent years.

Development was suspended on future ''Creatures'' games on March 20, 2003, when Creature Labs ceased operations, but development and trademark rights have since been purchased by Gameware Development, Ltd. Gameware has revived the Creatures Developer Network, the shop, the forums, the Docking Station server, and has released many before-purchasable tools and add-ons for free.&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/diary.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517015602/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/diary.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-17 |title=Gameware Development |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gameware staff that previously worked on ''Creatures'' developed a convergent media game for the [[BBC]] called ''[[BAMZOOKi]]''.&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment1"/&gt;

In 2004, the ''Creatures'' games have been re-released in combination packs under the names ''Creatures: The Albian Years'' (C1, C2), ''Creatures Exodus'' (C3, DS) and ''Creatures Village'' (CA, CP). The Albian Years, and Exodus include the separate games, whereas Village has merged Adventures and Playground into a single game.&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment1"/&gt;

[[Kutoka Interactive]], a Canadian children's software company, has created releases of ''Creatures Exodus'' (Kutoka) and ''Creatures Village'' (Kutoka Kids) that are compatible with both Apple's [[Mac OS X]] and [[Windows XP]].&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment1"/&gt; They were released on 30 September 2005, and can be purchased either directly from Kutoka or from other online stores.

==Gameplay==
Basic gameplay consists of hatching some creatures, usually norns, and guiding them to reach maturity and to breed more creatures, with the goal of a more intelligent future population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2874/designers_notebook_more_sexes_.php |title=Features - Designer's Notebook: More Sex(es) in Computer Games |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Words can be taught to creatures by a learning computer (for verbs) or by repeating the name of the object while the creature is looking at it.

===Species===
;Norns

A Norn is an AIL (Artificial intelligent life) species, the development and survival of which constitute the main thematic elements of the program.

Norns are playful, all-trusting, naive creatures that love to explore. This is often the reason for their downfall, suffering, and death. They are more susceptible to disease in comparison to Ettins and Grendels, and in old age they may fall prey to a wasting disease that prevents them from absorbing certain nutrients.

Grand wished Norns to be endearing and for players to keep them as pets - that they should be independent and stubborn, like toddlers, and that the design of the norn should be appealing to as many people as possible, and that the player should care about the norns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creatures.co.uk/Library/History/lib_history_norn.htm |title=The evolution of a species |publisher=Creatures.org.uk |date=March 1994 |accessdate=2012-11-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010212093320/http://www.creatures.co.uk/Library/History/lib_history_norn.htm |archivedate=2001-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reviewers have compared the Norns' visual design to the Mogwai of the ''[[Gremlins]]'' film series.&lt;ref name="Jepsen C2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jepsen|first=Dawn|title=They're Dead, Jim: Natural Selection Goes Awry in This Depressing Update|journal=[[Computer Gaming World]]|date=January 1999|issue=174|pages=364, 366}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwinnable.com/2012/01/27/playing-god-on-death-motherhood-and-creatures/#more-26486 |title=Playing God: On Death, Motherhood and ‘Creatures’ |author=Frank, Jenn |publisher=Unwinnable |date=2012-01-27 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Shee originally created the Norns as a mixture of [[valet]] and pet. According to the Creatures Labs website, they spread across the galaxy through the Warp and evolved into various variations, including but not restricted to: Toxic Norn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/creatures_more.php?id=503_0_6_0_M26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517015813/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/creatures_more.php?id=503_0_6_0_M26 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-17 |title=The Toxic Norn Story |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treehugger Norn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/creatures_more.php?id=504_0_6_0_M26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205201459/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/creatures_more.php?id=504_0_6_0_M26 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-02-05 |title=The Treehugger Norn Story |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Magma Norns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/creatures_more.php?id=501_0_6_0_M26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517020401/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/creatures_more.php?id=501_0_6_0_M26 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-17 |title=The Magma Norn Story |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of Norns throughout the galaxy is related to the mysterious disappearance of the Shee from Albia (from the point of view of the Norns). It may also be a sign of how the Shee fared in their attempt to find a habitable planet.

In the games, the Norns have their own simulated biochemistry, haploid genetics, and [[neural network]] to serve as a brain. From Creatures 2 onwards, Norns also possess organs determined by their genetics;&lt;ref name="Gamasutra C2"/&gt; mutation and injury can render these defunct, with typically fatal consequences. Each of these has grown somewhat over the course of the series, allowing the creatures to become more complex and intelligent. Norns are omnivores and eat a variety of foods, including carrots, lemons, seeds, insects, fish, honey, and other things. The Norns that the player starts with require some degree of training and discipline from the player in order to make good decisions to maintain their health; however, later on they can evolve to be more independent and hardy, with better-developed instincts and a more robust biochemistry. The player can take advantage of this to breed certain colours or traits through artificial selection, and through many generations the changes can become quite pronounced.

Norns are very social animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jepsen|first=Dawn|title=It's Alive: ''Creatures'' Is Bound To Tickle Your Fancy|journal=[[Computer Gaming World]]|date=November 1997|issue=160|pages=314–315}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes to the extent that they will prefer to play with other norns than to eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19971016000951/http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/creatures_newsletter_june2.htm |url=http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/creatures_newsletter_june2.htm |title=Creatures Newsletter June p.2 |publisher=Cyberlife |archivedate=1997-10-16 |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312050032/http://worldvillage.com/wv/gamezone/html/reviews/creature.htm |url=http://worldvillage.com/wv/gamezone/html/reviews/creature.htm |title=Creatures |publisher=Gamer's Zone |author=Meinfelder, Edmond |archivedate=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Shee
[[File:Shee statue.png|thumb|right|The statue of a Shee in ''[[Creatures 2]]''. This is one of very few official in-game appearances of the Shee. (There are more hidden deeper in.)]]
The Shee are a race of absent-minded scientists. They are the original inhabitants of Albia, and the creators of the Norns, Ettins, and Grendels.

The Shee are all inventors, and make most of their inventions to save time on tasks that would have taken but a few minutes otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creatures.co.uk/Library/History/lib_history_shee.htm |title=Shee Mystery Unfolds |publisher=creatures.org.uk |accessdate=2012-11-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001214182000/http://www.creatures.co.uk/Library/History/lib_history_shee.htm |archivedate=December 14, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of their discoveries are made by accident, and as such, they sequenced their own [[DNA]] and eliminated all genetic defects, before discovering the wheel.

Millennia ago, the Shee had left the disk-shaped world of Albia, as they desired to live on a "more spherical world". They created the Shee Ark, took along some Norns, Ettins, and various animals and plants, and set out for their new home. The Shee Ark, like all Shee spacecraft, was itself a living creature grown from scratch, and used "Bioenergy" (the energy of living things, used to balance the game) to perform its various functions.

Early concepts of the Shee had them as merely a more advanced life form than the Norns, not their creators.&lt;ref name=definitivearticle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fp.cyberlifersrch.plus.com/creaturesarchive/definitivearticle.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927203105/http://fp.cyberlifersrch.plus.com/creaturesarchive/definitivearticle.htm |author=Grand, Steve |archivedate=2008-09-27 |title=Small Furry Creatures: The Definitive Article |publisher=Cyberlife Research |date=4 November 1994 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Ettins
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ettin.jpg|thumb|left|123px|An Ettin from [[Creatures|Creatures 3]].]] --&gt;Ettins are a species in ''[[Creatures 2]]'' and ''[[Creatures 3]]''.

Ettins were created by the Shee to help them on their experiments, especially when using machinery. They made them like machines so much, they tend to steal bits for themselves, often taking them to wherever they consider their home.

''C2'' Ettins behave rather differently; they tend to lead a sad and lonely life underground with no one but Pitz and the occasional Grendel for company. The backstory in the guides and manual, as well as the opening sequence, reveals that they once lived in the desert at the top of Albia and, true to their nature, built the pyramid that sits there. The actual use (if any) of the pyramid is unknown.

Ettins were introduced into the ''Creatures'' series in ''C2'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creatures.co.uk/creatures2_news1.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981206040212/http://www.creatures.co.uk/creatures2_news1.htm |archivedate=1998-12-06 |title=Creatures 2 Newsletter 1. |publisher=creatures.org.uk |date=1998-12-06 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; having been revealed to the world after the volcanic eruption.

An early concept of the Ettins described them as insignificant "small, lizard-like creatures", who were often kept as pets by Norns.&lt;ref name=mythography/&gt;

The Ettins in ''Creatures 2'' were infertile; however, in ''Creatures 3'', there were two Ettins aboard the Shee Ark at most times (both female), and it was possible to get them to breed if two of them were placed in the Gene Splicer machine to create a male Ettin.

An in-depth exploration of the genetics and neurology of the Ettins in ''Creatures 2'' revealed that they were constantly in pain, apparently by design. This discovery was met by fan uproar.

;Grendels
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:C2 Grendelimage.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Creatures 2]] Grendel]] --&gt;
Grendels are the green-skinned, red-eyed antagonists of the Norns, over which the player has little control, stealing food and injuring individual Norns. They also carry diseases harmful to Norns.&lt;ref name=TCGDE/&gt;  The early concepts of their appearance described them as "resembling a huge, titanium spider".&lt;ref name=mythography/&gt;

In the unmodified ''Creatures 1'' and ''2'', Grendels do not reproduce, being born infertile. Generally, only one Grendel is alive in the world of Albia at a time. In ''Creatures 3'', two Grendels were alive aboard the Shee Ark at most times (both male), but it was possible to get them to breed and have offspring if both were placed in the Gene Splicer machine and used to create a female Grendel.

In all three games, Grendels are automatically produced by a "Mother" machine; in ''Creatures 3'', however, it is possible to ensure that there are no Grendels in the game by killing any existing grendels (e.g. in the [[airlock]]) and then waiting by the mother, then placing any eggs into water (the [[piranha]] pool) so that they cannot hatch.

The Grendels were another genetically engineered creation of the Shee, albeit an accidental one. They were certainly not what the Shee were trying to get as a result from their experiments, and were considered to be harmful, useless monsters. However, some of the evil Shee (known as the Banshee) believed the Grendels were genetically superior to the Norns, and kept some for improvement.

It is possible to cross a Norn with a Grendel, creating a 'Grenorn'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/news/topstories/0,1287,5037,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011129065439/http://www.wired.com/news/topstories/0%2C1287%2C5037%2C00.html |archivedate=2001-11-29 |title=Digital DNA Swap Meet |publisher=Wired.com |date=2001-11-29 |accessdate=2012-12-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19971015235359/http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/creatures_newsletter_july.htm |url=http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/creatures_newsletter_july.htm |title=Creatures July Newsletter Page 1 |publisher=Cyberlife |archivedate=1997-10-15 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Creatures community has appeared to adopt the Grendel as an underdog figure, creating a "Grendel Liberation Front" - despite being intended to add stress to Norns' lives, players began to tame their Grendels.&lt;ref name=TCGDE/&gt;

===User Interface===

In each of the games, players interact with the world through the use of a graphical hand as the player's mouse in the main visual area of the game. In ''Creatures'' and ''Creatures 2'', players can use applets in a toolbar, often called Kits, along the top of the game window, to access many functions, such as getting their first norn eggs, naming and photographing their norns, monitoring the health and general biochemistry of the norns and administering medicines, monitoring pregnancies, injecting objects into the world, and recording deceased norns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/creatures_toolbar.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19971016002046/http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/creatures_toolbar.htm |archivedate=1997-10-16 |title=THE CREATURES TOOLBAR. |publisher=Cyberlife |date=1997-10-16 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads/C1Manual.pdf |title=Creatures Deluxe Breeder's Manual |format=PDF |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2012-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224453/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads/C1Manual.pdf |archivedate=October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Creatures 2'' introduced an Ecology Kit and Neuroscience Kit.&lt;ref name=C2manual&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads/C2Manual.pdf |title=Creatures 2 Manual |format=PDF |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2012-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232906/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads/C2Manual.pdf |archivedate=October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Creature 3 and Docking Station, players still use a hand as their mouse to interact with creatures and the world, but the main game area does not have toolbars like in Creatures and Creatures 2, but instead has areas along the sides of the screens with buttons that the user can press to move to different locations, view the current creatures in the world, manage an inventory of items, and change game settings.

Charlie Brooker regarded the level of detail shown in the monitoring kits as "terrifying",&lt;ref name="Brooker"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brooker|first=Charlie|title=Creatures|url=http://m.computerandvideogames.com/2854/creatures|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130120064244/http://m.computerandvideogames.com/2854/creatures|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 January 2013|publisher=[[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]]|accessdate=9 December 2012|date=12 Aug 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been argued that the detailed monitoring kits highlight the artificiality of the norns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meer|first1=Alec|title=Have You Played… Creatures?|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/12/20/have-you-played-creatures/|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Smith disliked the limitation of C1 that the player is "limited to seeing areas that you've tagged as favorite places or that are currently inhabited by Norns," and found it difficult to correctly reward and punish the creatures.&lt;ref name="cdmag2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdmag.com/articles/010/013/creatures_review.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031027104034/http://www.cdmag.com/articles/010/013/creatures_review.html|archivedate=2003-10-27 |title=Creatures Review |author=Smith, Peter |publisher=[[Computer Games Strategy Plus]] |date=1998-01-31 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creatures 2 introduced an angel and devil glyph which appears next to the hand to show you whether you are about to reward or punish your creature.&lt;ref name="C2manual" /&gt; Jim Brumbaugh, in reviewing ''Creatures'', disliked the amount of typing that was needed to communicate with the creatures, but found the menu system "highly user friendly."

===Environment===
{{expand section|date=December 2012}}
While the initial pitch was for a desktop pet that could interact with other Windows programs, for example, [[Windows Media Player]],&lt;ref name=initialpitch/&gt; as the game developed, the need for a self-contained world became more apparent.  The world was named "Albia", after [[Albion]], and one of the goals of gameplay became to explore Albia.&lt;ref name=rationale/&gt;&lt;ref name=definitivearticle/&gt;  Grand thought that having the creatures inhabit a rich, "messy", world, and to be able to interact with it in many ways would help creatures' personalities to emerge.&lt;ref name="grand352"/&gt;  The backdrop for ''Creatures'' was created by taking photographs of a physical model of the world,&lt;ref name=mainhistory/&gt; part of which is now housed at [[The Centre for Computing History]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/42694/Creatures-Model/ Creatures Model - Computing History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The world is rendered in [[2.5D]], and the world can smoothly scroll to follow a creature.  The world contains many different items, which creatures can interact with in a variety of ways.  Objects are written using an [[object-oriented programming]] technique - each item has their own scripts which determine how they interact with creatures and with other objects.  Objects are detected by a creature by being in its line of sight, which excites a neuron dedicated to that class of objects.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mrl.snu.ac.kr/courses/CourseSyntheticCharacter/grand96creatures.pdf |title=Creatures: Artificial Life Autonomous Software Agents for Home Entertainment |author1=Grand, Steve |author2=Cliff, Dave |author3=Mahotra, Anil. |year=1996 |publisher=Millennium Technical Report 9601; University of Sussex Technical Report CSRP434 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The object-oriented approach means that the games are highly [[Mod (video gaming)|modifiable]].&lt;ref name="edge"/&gt;  Some of the items in the world are dangerous to norns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=James|first=Bonnie|title=Creatures|url=http://www.elecplay.com/pc/creatures.html|publisher=[[The Electronic Playground]]|accessdate=9 December 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970801040044/http://www.elecplay.com/pc/creatures.html|archivedate=1 August 1997|date=June 11, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Creatures 2'', the environment became more complex, with a "Complete working eco-system, including weather, seasons and a functioning food-chain. The plants seed and spread around the environment if conditions allow. The result of this is a very "real" feeling world that adapts around the player."&lt;ref name="Gamasutra C2"/&gt;

In ''Creatures 3'' and ''Docking Station'', the game was set on a spaceship.  The environment became more segmented into areas called "metarooms", small biomes, each with their own ecosystem.  Players could download and add new metarooms to their games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads/C3manual.pdf |title=Creatures 3 Manual |format=PDF |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2012-11-12}}{{Dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads/DSManual.pdf |title=Creatures Docking Station Manual |format=PDF |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2012-11-12}}{{Dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Games in the series==

There were six major ''Creatures'' releases from Creature Labs. In addition to the three principal games, the ''Docking Station'' add-on (generally referenced as a separate game) and two children's games were released.

===''On Albia'' (later re-released as ''Creatures: The Albian Years'')===

====''Creatures''====
The original ''Creatures'' game, released in the United Kingdom and Australia in November 1996 and in North America in July 1997, took place on the fictional disc-shaped world Albia. While the "faces" of the disc were uninhabitable, the "rim" of Albia was home to a complicated [[natural environment|environment]] much like Earth's. Here lay an abandoned system of [[laboratory|laboratories]] left over by the Shee, an advanced race that had suddenly left the planet many years earlier in order to find a more stable world. In these laboratories and environments, the player was able to hatch new Norns from leftover [[egg (biology)|eggs]] and re-inhabit the world of Albia. According to Millenium, every copy of ''Creatures'' contains a unique starting set of eggs, whose genomes are not replicated on any other copy of the game.&lt;ref name="NGen23"/&gt; An expansion pack, called "Life Kit #1" was released for purchase later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdmag.com/articles/010/034/lifekit_review.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030705043628/http://www.cdmag.com/articles/010/034/lifekit_review.html |archivedate=2003-07-05 |title=Creatures Life Kit #1 Review |author=Smith, Peter |publisher=[[Computer Games Strategy Plus]] |date=1998-01-31 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Creatures'' sold 100,000 copies by November 1997. At the time, John Moore of Mindscape explained that the company "expect[s] to sell more than 200,000 ''Creatures'' by the end of the year."&lt;ref name=sales1&gt;{{cite web | author=Anderson, Jill | title=Mindscape Sells 100,000 ''Creatures'' | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000520041544/http://headline.gamespot.com/news/97_11/03_creature/index.html | url=http://headline.gamespot.com:80/news/97_11/03_creature/index.html | archivedate=May 20, 2000 | work=[[GameSpot]] | date=November 3, 1997 | deadurl=yes | access-date=August 3, 2018 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Creatures 2''====

[[File:Creatures 2 game new Norn.PNG|right|thumb|Creatures 2 added 16-bit graphics and a larger world]]

''[[Creatures 2]]'', released on September 30, 1998, took place many years after the first game, after a devastating [[natural disaster]] (or, as explained in later games, a devastating Shee disaster) had changed the [[landscape]] of Albia dramatically and opened up new areas of the world. New [[technology]] and [[species]] were made available to the [[Player (game)|player]], and the creatures themselves had been provided with "considerably more sensory input, more actions they can take, and improved brain dynamics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|date=July 1998|title=Creatures 2|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the great change in environment, including a "complete working eco-system",&lt;ref name="Gamasutra C2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3271/from_creatures_to_androids.php |title=Features - From Creatures to Androids |publisher=Gamasutra |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the focus of the game remained the same. Creatures 2 Deluxe (with Life Kit) soon followed.  200,000 copies of ''Creatures 2'' were immediately shipped upon its release.&lt;ref name=TCGDE&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cliff|first=Dave|author2=Grand, Stephen|title=The Creatures Global Digital Ecosystem|journal=Artificial Life|year=1999|volume=5|issue=1|pages=77–93|doi=10.1162/106454699568683|pmid=10421678}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two expansion packs, Life Kit 1 and Life Kit 2, were released for C2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads_more.php?id=447_0_8_0_M15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517102057/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads_more.php?id=447_0_8_0_M15 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-17 |title=Creatures 2 Life Kit 1 |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads_more.php?id=34_0_8_0_M15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517102035/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads_more.php?id=34_0_8_0_M15 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-17 |title=Creatures 2 Life Kit 2 |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Creatures 2'' was considered "much more difficult" than ''C1'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clarkson|first=Mark|title=Creatures 2: Power-ups and Help on How to Keep Your Norns Alive|journal=[[Computer Gaming World]]|date=February 1999|issue=175|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the new, more challenging environment and norn biology was described as frustrating, but that after installing a new genome and going through successive generations, the Norns seemed smarter.&lt;ref name="Jepsen C2"/&gt;  Nick Walkland described the gameplay as a "labour of love", noting that the challenge was to sustain your Norns' lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Walkland|first=Nick|title=Creatures 2|url=http://m.computerandvideogames.com/2856/creatures-2|publisher=[[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]]|accessdate=9 December 2012|date=12 Aug 2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119175808/http://m.computerandvideogames.com/2856/creatures-2|archivedate=19 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sid Fisk of Gamezilla criticized the audio for Creatures 2 for not alerting him when his creature was near-death, but playing a "funeral dirge" as the body left the screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fisk|first1=Sid|title=Creatures 2 by Mindscape &amp; Cyberlife Technology Ltd.|url=http://www.gamezilla.com/reviews/c/creatures2.asp|website=Gamezilla|accessdate=10 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010622224025/http://www.gamezilla.com/reviews/c/creatures2.asp|archivedate=22 June 2001|date=24 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''After Leaving Albia'' (later re-released as ''Creatures Exodus'')===

====''Creatures 3''====
''[[Creatures 3]]'', released on November 4, 1999, took a detour from the first two games. It took place on the [[starship|spaceship]] that the Shee had used to flee Albia. The ship was divided into many carefully controlled [[natural environment|environment]]s (Norn Terrarium, Jungle Terrarium, Desert Terrarium, Marine Terrarium). ''Creatures 3'' was much more technologically focused, including many agents which could be connected in various ways to perform tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000821070502/http://www.gamecenter.com/Reviews/Item/Cont/0%2C7%2C0-3763_2%2C00.html |url=http://www.gamecenter.com/Reviews/Item/Cont/0,7,0-3763_2,00.html |title=Creatures 3 |publisher=Game Center.com |archivedate=2000-08-21 |accessdate=2012-12-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the goal was to [[experiment]] with the three principal species and create a living world out of an empty ship.  ''Creatures 3'' included a "new social element",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.computerandvideogames.com/2857/creatures-3 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130121042538/http://m.computerandvideogames.com/2857/creatures-3 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-21 |title=Creatures 3 &amp;#124; ComputerAndVideoGames.com |publisher=[[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]] |date=2001-08-12 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which norns could remember relationships they've formed with other creatures better.&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment3"/&gt;

====''Docking Station''====
The final major ''Creatures'' release was ''Docking Station'', an [[Internet]]-based add-on to ''Creatures 3'', released free of charge on the ''Creatures'' web site on March 27, 2001.&lt;ref name="highlights"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/2001/03/27/creatures-gets-new-creatures |title=Creatures Gets New Creatures |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended as a way to sell ''Creatures 3'' (you could dock the worlds of the two games together, hence the name ''"Docking" Station'') and extra packs of Norn breeds. ''Docking Station'' has an intermittent reminder screen that encourages users to buy ''Creatures 3''.

''Docking Station'' added the possibility of interaction between individual player worlds; Norns could 'travel' to other online worlds via a central server, players could [[online chat|chat]] to other online players, and it was possible to track Norns (and their offspring) that had been present in their worlds via the ''Docking Station'' website.&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment4"/&gt; While ''Docking Station'' was released late in the series' run, it changed gameplay (and the potential of the series) dramatically. One reviewer stated that it opened up a whole new world for her online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010607075048/http://gamezone.com/gzreviews/r18445.htm |url=http://gamezone.com/gzreviews/r18445.htm |title=Creatures Docking Station
 |publisher=GameZone |archivedate=2001-06-07 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another reviewer criticised the online portion of the game, as it requires the player to find online buddies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cadotte|first=Joseph|title=Creatures: Exodus|url=http://www.insidemacgames.com/reviews/view.php?ID=664 |publisher=[[Inside Mac Games]] |date=15 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Docking Station also expanded considerably on the game mythos, including the introduction of an 'anti-Shee', the Banshee (a Grendel/Shee hybrid).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creaturelabs.com/creatures/expansion/banshee.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20021208182711/http://www.creaturelabs.com/creatures/expansion/banshee.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-12-08 |title=The Banshee Grendels |publisher=Creature Labs |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Creatures Online''===
''Creatures Online'' was a planned sequel to the game, which was being developed by Fishing Cactus. The game was announced as ''Creatures 4'' in Fishing Cactus's blog in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fishingcactus.com/index.php/2011/05/18/announcing-creatures-4-on-ios-mac-and-pc/ |title=Fishing Cactus development blog » Blog Archive » Announcing Creatures 4 on iOS, Mac and PC |publisher=Blog.fishingcactus.com |date=2011-05-18 |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creatures Online was to have 5 worlds, was to be completely in 3D graphics instead of [[2.5D]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt; pre-rendered graphics, and in-game currency was planned to buy Norns toys, food, etc. Creatures Online was designed to be a [[free-to-play]] game.

===''Younger Children's Games'' (later re-released as ''Creatures Village'')===

====''Creatures Adventures''====
Released in 2000, and targeted at younger children (ages 6–9), ''Creatures Adventures'' dropped the complex interface of the main series in favour of brighter graphics and a more childlike atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyon|first1=James|title=Creatures Adventures|journal=[[PC Zone]]|date=1999|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Creatures Playground''====
The second game in the younger children's series, ''Creatures Playground'' (released the same year), could be connected to Adventures to create an even bigger world to explore.  It has a theme park for the creatures, including mini-games like whack-a-mole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schofield|first1=Jack|author-link=Jack Schofield (journalist)|title=Games reviews|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/nov/16/onlinesupplement4|date=16 November 2000 |accessdate=6 August 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Console games===
The ''Creatures'' concept was made into three different games for consoles: ''[[Creatures (Game Boy Advance game)|Creatures]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]] and ''[[Creatures (PlayStation game)|Creatures]]'' and ''[[Creatures: Raised in Space]]'' for [[PlayStation]].  In the PlayStation games, the hand is replaced by a [[fairy]] named Scrubby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roper|first=Chris|title=Creatures Review|url=http://ign.com/articles/2002/09/23/creatures-review|publisher=IGN |date=23 September 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the limited processing power of the early-day consoles, the [[AI]] had to be completely reprogrammed by the console development team around [[Volker Eloesser]]. A fourth, ''Project Loci'', was in development at the time of Creatures Labs' liquidation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nicelytoasted.net/honey/archives/002107.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030826062030/http://www.nicelytoasted.net/honey/archives/002107.html |archivedate=2003-08-26 |title=Portfolio: Creatures Project Loci |author=de Araujo, Lisa |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2003-08-26 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was cancelled for lack of funds.  ''Loci'' would have been the first ''Creatures'' game for the PS2, Xbox and GameCube.

==Later bundled releases==
There have been various re-releases of the ''Creatures'' games. The later re-releases from Gameware improved Windows XP compatibility by allowing them to run easily under non-administrator accounts and without the use of the  compatibility mode, but break compatibility with some third-party content without the use of a third-party patch.

;''Creatures Trilogy'' / ''Creatures Trilogy Gold Collection''
This release of ''Creatures Trilogy'' included ''Creatures'', ''Creatures 2'', and ''Creatures 3'', as well as the ''Life Kit'' addons for the earlier games. It was released before ''Docking Station'', but the version of ''Creatures 3'' included in this was identical to the original release (except that it was using the newest patch) and was therefore compatible with ''Docking Station''.

Encore Software released a ''Creatures Trilogy'' containing ''Creatures'', ''Creatures 2'', and ''Creatures 3'',&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/print.php?id=468_0_10_0 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105173924/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/print.php?id=468_0_10_0 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-01-05 |title=GameWare Development |publisher=GameWare Development |date=2003-01-01 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; under their [[Encare]] line. They also released a "gold" version titled ''Creatures Trilogy Gold Collection''.

;''Creatures Internet Edition'' / ''Creatures Gold''
The final major ''Creatures'' release was a re-release in 2001 by FastTrak Software Publishing as ''Creatures Internet Edition'', a bundle of ''Creatures 3'', ''Creatures 3 Update 2'', ''Docking Station'', and a number of environment extras and tools (many with multilingual variants).&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment2"/&gt; [[Linux Game Publishing]] released a Linux port of ''Creatures Internet Edition'' a few months later in December 2001.

The original ''Creatures Internet Edition'' was released again in 2002 by [[Focus Multimedia]], without the physical manual, as ''Creatures Gold'', but the disc contents were identical (and so the installer and PDF manual both referred to it as ''Creatures Internet Edition'').

;''Creatures: The Albian Years''
''Creatures 1'' and ''[[Creatures 2]]'' on one disk, updated to run on Windows XP.

;''Creatures Exodus''
''[[Creatures 3]]'' and ''Docking Station'' plus a selection of new Norn breeds on one disk, updated for improved Windows XP compatibility. Mac OS X and Windows &amp; Mac dual-format, and [https://web.archive.org/web/20110517015344/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/ds/ds_more.php?id=552_0_16_0_C free downloadable] versions are also available.

;''Creatures Village''
''Creatures Adventures'' and ''Creatures Playground'', merged and updated for improved Windows XP compatibility. Mac OS X and Windows &amp; Mac dual-format versions are also available.

;''Creatures Triple Collection''
''Creatures Triple Pack'', otherwise known as ''Creatures Collection: Triple'', contains ''The Albian Years'', ''Creatures Exodus'' and ''Creatures Village'' for Windows.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=October 2013}}
As of September 2017, the Creatures Community, or CC, is still very active online and in the games;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://creaturescaves.com/index.php|title=Creatures Caves {{!}} Home |last=Rascii|website=creaturescaves.com|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, the Community holds a festival called the Creatures Community Spirit Festival,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.creatures.org.uk/ccsf/|title=Creatures Community Spirit Festival|website=www.creatures.org.uk|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; or CCSF, to celebrate the games and the community that has formed since the creation of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Denton|first1=Abby|title=Artificial life finds a way: the legacy of Creatures|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/01/12/creatures-fans-mods-artificial-life/|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players have always ranged in age and the enthusiasm for the games is still very high.

Several reviews of the series emphasise that the player will need patience,&lt;ref name="CNETreview" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rita Courtney |url=http://www.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r12597.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010701213611/http://www.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r12597.htm |archivedate=2001-07-01 |title=GameZone.com - PC Game Reviews - Creatures 3 |publisher=Web.archive.org |year=2000 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hubble1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hubble|first=Calvin|title=Creatures Review|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/creatures|publisher=Game Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fielder |first=Lauren |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/creatures-2-review/1900-2538465/ |title=Creatures 2 Review |publisher=GameSpot |date=1998-11-13 |accessdate=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recommend it for players who are not parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leonard |first=Andrew |title=The Game of Life |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.02/streetcred_pr.html |work=Street Cred |publisher=[[Wired.com]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127023401/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.02/streetcred_pr.html |archivedate=November 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgameplay.co.uk/reviews/puzzle/creatures3.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20010508111713/http://www.pcgameplay.co.uk/reviews/puzzle/creatures3.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-05-08 |title=Creatures 3 |date=2001-05-08 |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early games do not have specific goals,&lt;ref name="facebook2013"/&gt; leading some reviewers to consider it a 'small scale genetic experiment' rather than a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|date=May 1997|title=Creatures|pages=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer compares the game to a virtual '[[fish tank]]', feeling that once the frustration of raising norns through their childhood was over and a breeding population had been established, the game became boring for him.&lt;ref name="cdmag2003"/&gt;

Several reviewers compared Creatures favourably to [[Tamagotchi]] when Creatures first came out.&lt;ref name="hubble1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alderman |first=John |title=Tamagotchi, Schmamagotchi: Here Come the Norns |url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/1997/05/3639 |publisher=[[Wired.com]] |date=6 May 1997 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013456/http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/1997/05/3639 |archivedate=December 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Caroline Daniel]], it is intriguing what our interactions with the game will reveal about us.  Furthermore, Daniel regarded the game as an important step in popularising artificial life technology in the home.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, Caroline. "Little life forms to call your own." ''[[New Statesman]]'' 15 Nov. 1996: 12. Literature Resource Center. Web. 12 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between July and November 1997, over 100,000 copies of ''Creatures'' were sold in the American market. ''[[Windows Sources]]'' magazine gave the series a "Stellar Award".&lt;ref&gt;"Creatures Sells 100,000 Copies in Less Than 100 Days, Virtual Life Sim from Mindscape Continues to Fly off the Shelves." ''[[Business Wire]]'' 3 Nov. 1997: 11030074. General OneFile. Web. 12 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jay Schindler wondered if this game was entertainment or a simulation of parenthood.  Schindler criticised the inability to scroll all the way around the world.  Schindler also noted that raising a group of norns was much more difficult than raising a single norn, as they could interact with each other with much greater ease than he could interact with a norn.&lt;ref name=Schindler&gt;Schindler, Jay. "CREATURES." ''[[Simulation &amp; Gaming]]'' 29.4 (1998): 482. General OneFile. Web. 12 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Don Labriola wrote of ''Creatures'' that "no other program so successfully mirrors the joys and challenges of raising a child or pet."&lt;ref&gt;Labriola, Don. "Mindscape's Creatures brings artificial life to your desktop." ''[[Computer Shopper (US magazine)|Computer Shopper]]'' Nov. 1997: 290. General OneFile. Web. 12 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the ''Creatures'' series was featured by an academic study into science-themed video games as depicting an accurate model of evolution and natural selection, displaying three key features of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leith|first1=Alex|title=Playing a science-based video game?

Since their first appearance in 1963 there have been a number of variant models of the '''[[Dalek]]s''', a fictional [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] race in the [[BBC]] [[science fiction television]] programme ''[[Doctor Who]]''.

First seen in the serial ''[[The Daleks]]'' (1963–64), the outward manifestation is portrayed as a powerful, technically advanced travel machine in which a hideous and malevolent [[mutant]], the Dalek creature, resides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Corry, Neil; [[Jacqueline Rayner|Rayner, Jacqueline]]; Darling, Andrew; Dougherty, Kerrie; John, David; Beecroft, Simon |date=2010 |title=Doctor Who: The Visual Dictionary |location=London |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |page=42 |isbn=978-1-4053-5033-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the general appearance of the Daleks has remained the same, details of both the casing and the mutant creature have changed over time. Alterations were made to accommodate the requirements of specific plot elements in various serials and episodes or at the request of producers, designers and directors to revitalise the Dalek appearance.&lt;ref name="NSD Design" &gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/episodes/S1_06 |title=Designing the Daleks: Interview with assistant designer Matthew Savage |date=2005 |website=BBC Doctor Who Website |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=9 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On other occasions design changes have been the result of practical considerations when filming the Dalek props on location, or the mixing of components acquired from different sources.

The episodes "[[Asylum of the Daleks]]" (2012), "[[The Magician's Apprentice (Doctor Who)|The Magician's Apprentice]]" (2015) and "[[The Witch's Familiar]]" (2015) feature appearances by many of the Dalek variants seen in the ''Doctor Who'' programme since its inception.&lt;ref name="Asylum"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/doctorwho/entries/22168bbb-364f-3bb0-a36a-155dbff326fc |title=Asylum of the Daleks |author=The Doctor Who Team |date=c. 2012 |website=BBC One - Doctor Who |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Glossary of primary Dalek components==
The component names listed below are used in this article as an aid to tracking the detail changes made to the basic Dalek design to create variants. From the base up, the major components are:
* '''fender''': The projecting base of the Dalek prop.&lt;ref name="The Dalek Book" &gt;{{cite book |last1=Whitaker |first1=David |authorlink1=David Whitaker (screenwriter) |last2=Nation |first2=Terry |authorlink2=Terry Nation |date=1964 |title=[[Dalek comic strips, illustrated annuals and graphic novels#The Dalek Book|''The Dalek Book'']] |location=London |publisher=[[Panther Books]] / Souvenir Press Ltd |pages=54–55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--NOTE: please only add "bumper" if you have a citation for this--&gt; 
* '''skirt''': The section with angled faces, to which the hemispheres are attached.
* '''hemispheres''': Also known as "hemis" and "sense globes", fifty-six of these items (forty-eight on [[#New Paradigm Daleks|New Paradigm Daleks]]) are fixed in four rows to the skirt panels.
* '''shoulders''': The section between the top of the skirt and the neck bin.
* '''collars''': Two horizontal bands fitted around the shoulders.
* '''slats''': Vertical rectangular panels fitted around the upper collar.
* '''shoulder mesh''': Diamond-section mesh fitted between the slats and the upper collar.
* '''appendage boxes''': Projecting boxes housing the ball joints for the arm and gun stick.
* '''gun stick''': Usually portrayed as a variable discharge energy weapon.
* '''gun rods''': Longitudinal rods forming a cage around the gun stick.
* '''gun mantles''': Octagonal cross-members bracing the gun rods along their length.
* '''arm''': A telescopic arm, having two or three sections.
* '''plunger''': Fixed to the end of the arm and depicted as a Dalek's primary manipulating appendage.
* '''neck bin''': The section between the shoulders and the dome.
* '''neck bin mesh''': Mesh fitted between the neck bin and the neck rings.
* '''neck rings''': Horizontal rings fitted around the neck bin.
* '''neck struts''': Eight thin, vertical struts on the exterior of the neck bin, between the top of the shoulders and the dome.
* '''dome''': The rotatable top component of the travel machine.
* '''dome lights''': Lights fixed to the dome, which flash when the Dalek is shown speaking.
* '''eye stalk''': A rod projecting from the dome, which can pivot vertically.
* '''eye discs''': A series of discs of varying diameter through which the eye stalk is threaded.
* '''eyeball''': A spherical component fitted to the end of the eye stalk, shown in various episodes to contain the Dalek's visual apparatus.
* '''eye lens''': A circular lens at the front of the eyeball which, depending on the variant, is sometimes illuminated or has a central pupil.
* '''dome cowl''': A structure which projects from the front of the dome and surrounds the eye stalk pivot. ([[#"New Series" Daleks|"New Series" Daleks]] only)

==General design==
{{See also|Dalek#Physical characteristics|l1=Dalek physical characteristics}}

===Overview===
Externally Daleks have the appearance of a truncated cone varying between approximately 1.5&amp;nbsp;metres (5&amp;nbsp;feet) and 2&amp;nbsp;metres (6&amp;nbsp;feet 6&amp;nbsp;inches) tall depending upon the variant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tribe |first1=Steve |last2=Goss |first2=James |authorlink2=James Goss (producer) |date=2011 |title=The Dalek Handbook |location=London |publisher=[[BBC Books]] |pages=150–151 |isbn=978-1-84990-232-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are equipped with a single mechanical rod-mounted eye which protrudes from a rotating dome, a directed energy weapon and a telescopic arm. Usually the arm is fitted with a manipulating device resembling a [[sink plunger]]. This item is shown in various episodes to be capable of holding people and objects, seemingly using a powerful vacuum. The weapon is depicted as having a variable output which can paralyse, stun or kill most life forms, disintegrate other Daleks and destroy buildings and spacecraft.

===Casing===
In ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'' (1988)&lt;ref name="Remembrance of the Daleks"&gt;{{cite serial |title=''Season 25.'' [[Remembrance of the Daleks]] |series=[[Doctor Who]] |credits=[[Ben Aaronovitch]] (writer), Andrew Morgan, [[John Nathan-Turner]] (uncredited) (directors), John Nathan-Turner (producer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC1]] |airdate=5–26 October 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the episodes "[[The Parting of the Ways]]" (2005)&lt;ref name="The Parting of the Ways"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[The Parting of the Ways]] |series=[[Doctor Who]] |series-no=1 |number=13 |credits=[[Russell T Davies]] (writer), [[Joe Ahearne]] (director), [[Phil Collinson]] (producer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=18 June 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]" (2006)&lt;ref name="Doomsday"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]] |series=[[Doctor Who]] |series-no=2 |number=13 |credits=[[Russell T Davies]] (writer), [[Graeme Harper]] (director), [[Phil Collinson]] (producer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=8 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Doctor states that Dalek casings are constructed from "bonded polycarbide", with this material being referred to as "dalekanium" in ''[[The Dalek Invasion of Earth]]'' (1964)&lt;ref name="The Dalek Invasion of Earth"&gt;{{cite serial |title=''Season 2.'' [[The Dalek Invasion of Earth]] |series=[[Doctor Who]] |credits=[[Terry Nation]] (writer), Richard Martin (director), [[Verity Lambert]], [[Mervyn Pinfield]] (producers) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC1]] |airdate=21 November – 26 December 1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Daleks in Manhattan]]" (2007).&lt;ref name="Daleks in Manhattan"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Daleks in Manhattan]] |series=[[Doctor Who]] |series-no=3 |number=4 |credits=[[Helen Raynor]] (writer), [[James Strong (director)|James Strong]] (director), [[Phil Collinson]] (producer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=21 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The casing is depicted as being impervious to most projectile and energy weapons, although not indestructible. In various episodes Daleks are shown being damaged or destroyed by overwhelming firepower, their own weaponry and falls from a height.&lt;ref name="Resurrection of the Daleks" &gt;{{cite serial |title=''Season 21.'' [[Resurrection of the Daleks]] |series=[[Doctor Who]] |credits=[[Eric Saward]] (writer), [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]] (director), [[John Nathan-Turner]] (producer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC1]] |airdate=8–15 February 1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]'' (1985), they are said to be vulnerable to "bastic-headed bullets".&lt;ref name="Revelation of the Daleks"&gt;{{cite serial |title=''Season 22.'' [[Revelation of the Daleks]] |series=[[Doctor Who]] |credits=[[Eric Saward]] (writer), [[Graeme Harper]] (director), [[John Nathan-Turner]] (producer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC1]] |airdate=23–30 March 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In appearances from 2005 onwards a Dalek's defensive capability has been shown to include an invisible force shield, with the eye remaining a weak point.

The lower shell is covered with hemispherical protrusions. In the BBC-licensed ''[[Dalek comic strips, illustrated annuals and graphic novels#The Dalek Book|The Dalek Book]]'' (1964),&lt;ref name="The Dalek Book" /&gt; and again in ''The Doctor Who Technical Manual'' (1983),&lt;ref name="The Doctor Who Technical Manual" &gt;{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Mark |authorlink1=Mark Harris (author) |date=1983 |title=The Doctor Who Technical Manual |location=Sutton |publisher=[[Severn House Publishers]] |pages=22–23 |isbn=0-7278-2034-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; these items are described as being part of a sensory array. In "[[Dalek (Doctor Who episode)|Dalek]]" (2005) they are shown to act as components in a self-destruct mechanism.&lt;ref name="Dalek"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Dalek (Doctor Who episode)|Dalek]] |series=[[Doctor Who]] |series-no=1 |number=6 |credits=[[Robert Shearman]] (writer), [[Joe Ahearne]] (director), [[Phil Collinson]] (producer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=30 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eye===
Historically, a Dalek's eye has been depicted as its most vulnerable spot. In "[[Silence in the Library]]" (2008) the Doctor, speaking of how to deal with various alien menaces, says "Daleks: aim for the eye stalk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Silence in the Library]] |series=[[Doctor Who]] |series-no=4 |number=8 |credits=[[Steven Moffat]] (writer), [[Euros Lyn]] (director), [[Phil Collinson]] (producer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=31 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the revived series from 2005 onwards, storylines have shown Daleks as having systems to protect their vision. In the 2008 episode "[[The Stolen Earth]]", [[Wilfred Mott]] attempts to disable a Dalek by blinding it using a [[paintball gun]]. The Dalek is seen to simply evaporate the paint from its eye.&lt;ref name="The Stolen Earth"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[The Stolen Earth]] |series=[[Doctor Who]] |series-no=4 |number=12 |credits=Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director [[Graeme Harper]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=28 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eye lens, eye discs and dome lights===
While maintaining their general shape and appearance, the design of these components has varied over the years. Eye lenses were first shown as blank, white discs, sometimes featuring internal illumination. Later, lenses with a black "[[pupil]]" were introduced. [[#"New Series" Daleks|"New Series" Daleks]] have a clear lens which glows with a blue light while [[#New Paradigm Daleks|New Paradigm Daleks]], introduced in the episode "[[Victory of the Daleks]]" (2010), are equipped with an "organic eyeball" set behind a small transparent hemisphere.&lt;ref name="DWC 5/3"&gt;{{cite episode |title=War Games |series=[[Doctor Who Confidential]] |series-no=5 |number=3 |credits=[[Alex Price]] (narrator), Adam Page (director), Adam Page (producer), Gillane Seaborne (series producer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC Three]] |airdate=17 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1960s Daleks were occasionally shown with a functioning iris, a feature also seen in the "New Series" Dalek design. The eye discs have varied in number, size, spacing, profile and configuration. Colour has generally been restricted to powder blue, white or gold, with "New Series" Dalek eye discs having a translucent, frosted appearance and those of the New Paradigm variant being black.&lt;ref name="The Eyestalk" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projectdalek.co.uk/files/autopsy/eye.html |title=Dalek Autopsy: The Eyestalk |date=2009 |website=Project Dalek Website |publisher=John Darley |access-date=10 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dome-light covers first resembled [[table tennis ball]]s, before items having the appearance of plastic [[egg cup]] inserts were substituted. Later these were replaced by various types of "[[Beehive#Skeps|bee skep]]-shaped" vehicle side light lenses. The flattened lights fitted to the Imperial Daleks seen in ''Remembrance of the Daleks'' were formed from [[Perspex]] discs capped by commercially available saucer-shaped plastic components, while "New Series" and New Paradigm Daleks have light-covers consisting of tubular beacon lenses, the former variant's being surrounded by a metal cage.&lt;ref name="The Domelights" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projectdalek.co.uk/files/autopsy/domelights.html |title=Dalek Autopsy: The Domelights |date=2009 |website=Project Dalek Website |publisher=John Darley | access-date=5 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Underside===
The underside structure of a Dalek casing was indeterminate until the publication of ''The Dalek Book '' (1964). This included a cutaway drawing entitled "Anatomy of a Dalek" which showed it to have a base through which a large central sphere, surrounded by smaller satellite "balancing globes", protrudes.&lt;ref name="The Dalek Book" /&gt; This layout was generally adopted and used in subsequent Dalek plans and comic strip representations. This is at variance with the few glimpses seen in early ''Doctor Who'' television episodes and films, which made little attempt to show (or hide) anything other than the actual base of the Dalek prop. As this usually took the form of a plywood board to which castors had been attached and a hole cut out for the operator's feet, these brief appearances were of little assistance in maintaining the illusion of the props being functional, armoured casings housing an alien being. This situation was finally remedied in the episode "[[Dalek (Doctor Who episode)|Dalek]]" (2005) and subsequent appearances of the "New Series" Dalek. This variant is shown to have an underside consisting of a large, recessed central hemisphere surrounded by eight satellite hemispheres. The central hemisphere and four of the satellite hemispheres glow when the Dalek is in flight mode.&lt;ref name="Dalek" /&gt;

===Dalek mutant===
[[Image:Dalek Caan Mutant.JPG|thumb|alt=A brightly illuminated octopus-like creature, surrounded by machinery coated in strands of fibrous organic material, gazes upward with its single eye.|The Dalek Caan mutant from ''Journey's End''.]]
The creatures inside the "travel machines" are depicted as repulsive in appearance and vicious even without their mechanical armour. Rarely glimpsed until the programme's revival in 2005, they were usually shown as amorphous green blobs with strong tentacles capable of strangulation or, occasionally, as having clawed hands. Their appearance and evolution is variously attributed to radioactive fallout from a catastrophic war,&lt;ref name="The Daleks"&gt;{{cite serial |title=''Season 1.''

In the episode "[[The Witch's Familiar]]" (2015) it is revealed that the mutants are biologically immortal, yet still gradually age to eventually rot away into a liquid mass. These decayed Daleks are ultimately deposited in [[Skaro]]'s sewer system, where they decompose further into a living, maddened sludge.&lt;ref name="The Witch's Familiar"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[The Witch's Familiar]] |series=[[Doctor Who]] |series-no=9 |number=2 |credits=[[Steven Moffat]] (writer), [[Hettie MacDonald]] (director), [[Peter Bennett (producer)|Peter Bennett]] (producer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=26 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice===
Daleks have distinctive electronic voices, the harsh, staccato sound being created by actors speaking through a microphone into a device called a [[ring modulator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tribe |first1=Steve |last2=Goss |first2=James |authorlink2=James Goss (producer) |date=2011 |title=The Dalek Handbook |location=London |publisher=[[BBC Books]] |page=25 |isbn=978-1-84990-232-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While this produces considerable distortion and a monotone effect, inflection and pace are used to express a range of emotions including rage, triumph, disdain and, very occasionally, fear. (&amp;nbsp;{{Audio|Dalek Voice.ogg|play sample}}&amp;nbsp;)

===Locomotion and manoeuvrability===
Dalek locomotion is usually shown as a gliding movement a few centimetres above the ground. ''The Dalek Book'' (1964) indicates that traction is provided by a large, omnidirectional rotating metal sphere,&lt;ref name="The Dalek Book" /&gt; while in the serial ''[[Death to the Daleks]]'' (1974) the Doctor states that they move by [[Psychokinesis|psycho-kinetic power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/deathtodaleks/detail.shtml |title=BBC Doctor Who Episode Guide: Death to the Daleks |date=2009 |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=13 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For years Daleks were depicted as being unable to climb stairs, with travel confined to smooth ground and level surfaces. This was rectified in ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]'' in which a hovering Dalek was seen briefly,&lt;ref name="Revelation of the Daleks" /&gt; and then in ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'' which featured a Dalek levitating up a staircase.&lt;ref name="Remembrance of the Daleks" /&gt; From 2005 various ''Doctor Who'' episodes have shown Daleks hovering and flying with ease, locomotion being imparted by [[anti-gravity]] generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Corry, Neil; [[Jacqueline Rayner|Rayner, Jacqueline]]; Darling, Andrew; Dougherty, Kerrie; John, David; Beecroft, Simon |date=2010 |title=Doctor Who: The Visual Dictionary |location=London |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |pages=43, 51 |isbn=978-1-4053-5033-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dalek variant naming conventions==
During the course of the ''Doctor Who'' television programme the BBC, its producers and scriptwriters have rarely alluded to changes in Dalek design or ascribed names or designations to the various models seen. Notable exceptions usually refer to rank, such as "Emperor" and "Supreme Dalek", although in ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]'' the newly created Dalek casing is referred to as a "Mark 3 Travel Machine".

The Dalek variant naming conventions used in this article are attributed to the various models as a matter of convenience. They can be found in general use by the Doctor Who/Dalek fan base, and are often quoted in posts and documentation on websites such as The Project Dalek Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projectdalek.co.uk/ |title=Project Dalek Website |date=2009 |website=Project Dalek Website |publisher=John Darley | access-date=5 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other classifications for the major Dalek variants exist. ''The Doctor Who Technical Manual'' (1983) places both television and Movie Daleks in the same numerical sequence by order of their first screen appearances,&lt;ref name="The Doctor Who Technical Manual" /&gt; although reconciling the characters and events depicted in the Doctor Who films with those established in the TV programme is problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulcornell.com/2007/02/canonicity-in-doctor-who/ |title=Canonicity in Doctor Who |last=Cornell |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Cornell |date=10 February 2007 |website=paulcornell.com |access-date=31 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[Drone (bee)|drone]]" is used in this article to indicate a Dalek having no rank. Its only use to date in the Doctor Who television serials and films in which the Daleks have appeared has been in the [[Eleventh Doctor]] episode "[[Victory of the Daleks]]".

==Mark 1 Daleks==
The Daleks first appeared in the 1963 ''Doctor Who'' serial ''[[The Daleks]]''. There are no visual cues to distinguish one Dalek from another, or suggestions in the story of a hierarchy.&lt;ref name="The Daleks" /&gt;

The Mark 1 Dalek differs from later variants in having no shoulder slats or mesh, nine eye discs (the greatest number of any version) and a "[[toffee apple]]" shaped eyeball. The eye lenses are illuminated and shown to have an [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] which can expand and contract. These Daleks have a silver colour scheme with blue/grey shoulders, blue hemispheres and eye discs, collars in natural [[aluminium]] and black fenders. The story refers to them being powered by [[static electricity]], with mobility limited to the metal floors in the Dalek City on their home planet, [[Skaro]].

In the episode "The Ambush" a Dalek is shown using a device resembling a [[thermal lance]] to cut through a door. It consists of a long, slim tube flanked by two globes, surmounted by a clear disc-shaped "sight screen". This appendage is mounted to the Dalek's arm in place of a plunger.

The Dalek concept was the creation of screenwriter [[Terry Nation]], with the design being realised by BBC staff designer [[Raymond Cusick]]. The props were constructed by Shawcraft Engineering of Uxbridge, England under the direction of Bill Roberts, who also provided additional design input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tribe |first1=Steve |last2=Goss |first2=James |authorlink2=James Goss (producer) |date=2011 |title=The Dalek Handbook |location=London |publisher=[[BBC Books]] |pages=9, 19–21 |isbn=978-1-84990-232-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Four 1960s style Dalek props were recreated by Titan Props for the British television docudrama ''[[An Adventure in Space and Time]]'' (2013), commissioned by the BBC to celebrate the ''Doctor Who'' programme's fiftieth anniversary.&lt;ref name="Daily Record Article"&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Kenny |title=Daleks made in Scotland set to invade TV screens in new docudrama which celebrates 50 years of Doctor Who |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/tv-radio/daleks-made-scotland-set-invade-2804106 |newspaper=''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' |location=Glasgow |publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]] |date=18 November 2013 |access-date=18 November 2013 |issn=0956-8069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mark 2 Daleks==
The storyline for the second serial to feature the Daleks, ''[[The Dalek Invasion of Earth]]'' (1964), required the props to be used extensively on location. Consequently, serial designer Spencer Chapman and manufacturer Shawcraft Engineering devised a [[tricycle]] arrangement, incorporating three [[pneumatic tyre]]s, to replace the original [[Caster|castors]] and carry the props over uneven ground. Enlarged fenders were then created to hide the revised undercarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Howe |first1=David J. |authorlink1=David J. Howe |date=1997 |title=Doctor Who: A Book of Monsters |location=London |publisher=[[BBC Books]] |pages=84–85 |isbn=0-563-40562-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To explain the Daleks' ability to travel away from the static-charged floors of their city, the narrative has the Doctor stating that an [[Antenna (radio)|aerial]] located at the edge of a mine in Bedfordshire is the key to the Daleks' power supply on Earth. Although not referred to directly in the story, it is implied that the [[parabolic dish]]es now fitted to the rear shoulder section of each prop act as receptors for a form of transmitted energy. Other design changes are a reduction in the number of eye discs to five and painting some eyeballs silver instead of the standard black colour. An amphibious capability is demonstrated in the closing moments of the first episode of the serial when a Dalek emerges from beneath the waters of the River Thames.&lt;ref name="The Dalek Invasion of Earth" /&gt;

For the first time a Dalek command structure is introduced, with rank indicated by differing colour schemes. The Earth Task Force Commander, or "Saucer Commander", features a black dome and alternating light and dark skirt panels. A Supreme Controller or "Black Dalek" is also seen with a black dome, shoulders and skirt.

==Mark 3 Daleks==
First introduced in 1965, the basic design of the Mark 3 Dalek variant remained relatively unchanged throughout their later appearances.

===Mark 3 Daleks in the 1960s===
The Mark 3 Dalek variant first appeared in ''[[The Chase (Doctor Who)|The Chase]]'' (1965), with Ray Cusick returning as designer for the serial. As the production required no location filming and Cusick felt that Daleks should be shorter than an average person, he had the enlarged fenders and wheels, installed for ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'', removed and replaced with the original style of running gear.&lt;ref name="Raymond Cusick Interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dwasonline.co.uk/node/760?cat=node/758# |title=Ray Cusick Creator of a Legend - Interview |last=Winter |first=Paul |date=2006 |website=[[Doctor Who Appreciation Society]] |access-date=23 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622150702/http://www.dwasonline.co.uk/node/760?cat=node%2F758 |archivedate=22 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greater flexibility in the storylines was afforded by freeing the Daleks from reliance on static-charged metal floors for power and mobility. For this and further serials, however, the contrivance of dish aerials as energy receptors was dispensed with. They were replaced by a steel mesh wrapped around the upper collar of each prop, over which were mounted twenty-three vertical, oblong slats ostensibly forming a power collection array (although this function has never been confirmed on screen).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tribe |first1=Steve |last2=Goss |first2=James |authorlink2=James Goss (producer) |date=2011 |title=The Dalek Handbook |location=London |publisher=[[BBC Books]] |page=21 |isbn=978-1-84990-232-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Black Dalek appears in the first episode of ''The Chase''; "The Executioners". Daleks with non-standard arm appendages are also seen in this serial. A gimballed hemisphere referred to as both a "seismic detector" and a "[[TARDIS]] perceptor" appears, and in the episode "The Planet of Decision" an "electro unit" is employed to disable an electronic lock. The prop consisted of a large revolving parabolic dish from the centre of which two converging rods protruded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |title=''Season 2.'' [[The Chase (Doctor Who)|The Chase]] |series=[[Doctor Who]] |credits=[[Terry Nation]] (writer), Richard Martin, [[Douglas Camfield]] (directors), [[Verity Lambert]] (producer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC1]] |airdate=22 May – 26 June 1965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later 1960s serials in which they appeared the Dalek design remained virtually unchanged, with only minor variations to the standard colour scheme and appendages.

In ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]]'' (1965) several Daleks are shown clearing areas of jungle using short, tubular [[flame throwers]], referred to as "pyro-flame burners", in place of the standard plunger.

A Dalek with a circular [[Sieve|sieve-like]] scoop attachment in place of its plunger is seen in ''[[The Power of the Daleks]]'' (1966). It is used for transferring embryonic Dalek mutants from a liquid-filled nurturing tank to their travel machine casings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |title=''Season 4.''

In ''[[The Evil of the Daleks]]'' (1967) a Black Dalek is seen again, this time with grey shoulders. Two more elements of the Dalek hierarchy are also introduced; the [[#Dalek Emperor|Dalek Emperor]] and Daleks with black domes which appear to act as the Emperor's personal guard.&lt;ref name="The Evil of the Daleks"&gt;{{cite serial |title=''Season 4.''

For the first time a Dalek is seen with a black pupil centred in its eye lens.

An unusual version of the Mark 3 Dalek made an appearance in ''[[The Evil of the Daleks]]''. It featured narrow skirt and shoulder sections, with the rear skirt panel having only a single vertical line of hemispheres down the middle. These differences are not alluded to in the story. This prop is sometimes referred to as "The Wilkie Dalek" after Bernard Wilkie, the BBC technical designer who became primarily responsible for the ''Doctor Who'' programme's visual effects after Shawcraft's involvement ceased during 1967.&lt;ref name="The Wilkie Dalek" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dalek6388.co.uk/evil-of-the-daleks/ |title=Evil of the Daleks |last1=Green |first1=Jon |last2=Rymill |first2=Gavin |date=2011 |website=Dalek6388 |access-date=21 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mark 3 Daleks in the 1970s===
The Daleks returned in the 1972 serial ''[[Day of the Daleks]]'', their first appearance in colour on the ''Doctor Who'' television programme. "Drone" Daleks were now finished in grey, with black hemispheres and fender. Except for ''[[Death to the Daleks]]'' (1974), and albeit with variations in the shade of grey and occasional adornment with black slats, black collars or both, this stayed as the standard Dalek colour scheme for the remaining eight serials in which they appeared over the next sixteen years. During this period, however, several small changes to the standard Mark 3 Dalek design were made and their hierarchy was again expanded.

In ''[[Day of the Daleks]]'' a Dalek Leader is seen painted in gold, with black hemispheres and fender. This serial also saw the first appearance of an oval disc between the appendage boxes and a higher fender on all models. The eye lens "pupil", first seen in ''[[The Evil of the Daleks]]'', now became a standard fitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |title=''Season 9.''

Seven additional Dalek props were produced for ''[[Planet of the Daleks]]'' (1973), created by special effects professional Clifford Culley's company Westbury Design &amp; Optical Limited. The production crew referred to these props as "goons". Although fabricated using measurements and moulds taken from an existing prop, the "goon" Daleks exhibited minor differences from the original Shawcraft builds including the substitution of single dowel neck struts for the trefoil cross section items which were the norm up to this point.&lt;ref name="Dalek6388: Planet of the Daleks" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dalek6388.co.uk/planet-of-the-daleks/ |title=Planet of the Daleks |last1=Green |first1=Jon |last2=Rymill |first2=Gavin |date=2011 |website=Dalek6388 |access-date=21 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The story again called for a Dalek to cut through a metal door, on this occasion the cutting device replacing the plunger resembling the tip of a large [[soldering iron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |title=''Season 10.'' [[Planet of the Daleks]] |series=[[Doctor Who]] |credits=[[Terry Nation]] (writer), [[David Maloney]] (director), [[Barry Letts]] (producer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC1]] |airdate=7 April – 12 May 1973 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This serial also featured a unique variant; the [[#Dalek Supreme|Dalek Supreme]].

In ''[[Death to the Daleks]]'' the travel machines display a silver livery with black shoulders, hemispheres and fender. During the serial, due to a plot element, the standard blasters are replaced by projectile weapons featuring a drilled barrel with six small fins at the muzzle. After killing two primitive humanoids with these devices a Dalek declares them to be "...moderately efficient". The phasing-out of three section telescopic arms commenced in this serial, with two sections becoming the norm for the remainder of the classic series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |title=''Season 11.''

Briant]] (director), [[Barry Letts]] (producer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC1]] |airdate=23 February – 16 March 1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'' (1979) many of the Dalek props feature an attachment resembling a small stub aerial projecting from the top of the dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |title=''Season 17.'' [[Destiny of the Daleks]] |series=[[Doctor Who]] |credits=[[Terry Nation]] (writer), Ken Grieve (director), [[Graham Williams (television producer)|Graham Williams]] (producer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC1]] |airdate=1–22 September 1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Six crude, hollow, vacuum-formed Dalek props were also created. They were primarily used during location filming of the serial's finale, although several of them can also be seen in the background of some studio shots. They can be recognised by their thick neck struts and the absence of dome aerials and appendage ball joints. Production photographs taken at the time reveal that they also lacked hemispheres on the rear skirt panels.&lt;ref name="Dalek6388: Destiny of the Daleks" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dalek6388.co.uk/destiny-of-the-daleks/ |title=Destiny of the Daleks |last1=Green |first1=Jon |last2=Rymill |first2=Gavin |date=2011 |website=Dalek6388 |access-date=21 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of Daleks are seen in this story forming a suicide squad to destroy an enemy spacecraft, each with a number of bombs attached to its shoulder section. The bomb props consist of yellow cylinders capped at the ends by red hemispheres.

A Mark 3 drone Dalek with a distinctive design also appears in ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]''. It features a combination of "goon" and Shawcraft Dalek sections for the upper half, and a unique skirt with a rear section which flares out from the shoulders at almost the same angle as the front. Four prominent bolt heads frame the chest oval and large hemispheres are fitted. These differences are not alluded to in the story and the origin of the components remains uncertain. This variant is sometimes referred to as "The Tussauds Dalek" after [[Madame Tussauds]] wax museum in London, where it was exhibited (painted bright blue and silver) as part of their Doctor Who display in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="The Tussauds Dalek"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.longleatcyberman.com/TussaudsDalek/Home.html |title=The Tussauds Dalek |last=Murray |first=Steve |date=2011 |website=web.archive.org/longleatcyberman.com |access-date=2 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201234528/https://www.longleatcyberman.com/TussaudsDalek/Home.html |archivedate=1 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mark 3 Daleks in the 1980s===
Commencing with a cameo appearance in the ''Doctor Who'' serial ''[[The Five Doctors]]'' (1983), Mark 3 Dalek variants seen during this decade feature a neck bin raised so that a strip of it is visible between the lower neck ring and the top of the shoulders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |title=[[The Five Doctors]] |episode=[[The Five Doctors]] |series=[[Doctor Who]] |credits=[[Terrance Dicks]] (writer), [[Peter Moffatt]], [[John Nathan-Turner]] (uncredited) (directors), John Nathan-Turner (producer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC1]] |airdate=23 November 1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fitting of a small stub aerial to the dome continued, appearing for the last time in ''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]'' (1984).

The eyestalks and discs of standard Daleks in ''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]'' are painted white, with four discs arranged in a conical layout, smallest disc to the front. The Tussauds Dalek prop appears in this serial under two guises; a grey drone and a Supreme Dalek painted in gloss black with white hemispheres.&lt;ref name="Resurrection of the Daleks" /&gt; The Tussauds Dalek features briefly once more in ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]'', again portraying a drone.

==Dalek Emperor==
[[Image:Emperor and Mark3 Dalek.jpg|thumb|alt=Refer to caption.|The Dalek Emperor and a Mark 3 Dalek from ''The Evil of the Daleks''.]]
In ''[[The Evil of the Daleks]]'' (1967) the Emperor is presented as a towering, immobile, twelve-sided conical structure to which numerous [[umbilical cable]]s are connected. Twelve large, black hemispheres girdle its midsection with a further two smaller, tan-coloured hemispheres being mounted horizontally on the chest. It has a predominantly white colour scheme with black detailing and speaks in an echoing, grating voice. Shown mounted on a [[plinth]] in a corner of the control room in the Dalek City on [[Skaro]], in the story it is destroyed when a [[civil war]] breaks out among the Daleks.

The Dalek Emperor was created by the BBC Visual Effects Department.&lt;ref name="Evil of the Daleks" &gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/evildaleks/detail.shtml |title=Doctor Who Episode Guide: The Evil of the Daleks |date=2009 |website=BBC Website – DOCTOR WHO: The Classic Series |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=15 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dalek Supreme==
In ''[[Planet of the Daleks]]'' (1973) the Dalek Supreme, a member of the Dalek Supreme Council, is despatched to the planet Spiridon. It is tasked with overseeing experiments into invisibility, the production of a plague designed to exterminate all organic life and the deployment of a 10,000 strong Dalek invasion force.

The variant was based on a prop owned by screenwriter Terry Nation which had been used in the [[Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.|second Doctor Who film]].&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Time (Travel): Planet Of The Daleks" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/sss.html |title=Doctor Who – The Third Doctor – Serial SSS: Planet Of The Daleks |last=Sullivan |first=Shannon Patrick |date=2009 |website=A Brief History of Time (Travel) |access-date=4 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The neck bin mesh, struts and neck rings were removed, the latter items being replaced by new rings having a flat, recessed edge detailed with small rivets rather than the usual bevel. Lilac dome lights shaped like upturned jam jars were fitted, together with an eyeball resembling a flashlight which lit up when it spoke. It was painted in gloss black with yellow-gold hemispheres, slats, neck rings and dome. It is uncertain who carried out the conversion work, although the painting of the prop was undertaken by the BBC Visual Effects Department under the direction of Clifford Culley.&lt;ref name="Dalek6388: Planet of the Daleks" /&gt;

The ruthlessness of the Dalek Supreme is demonstrated in the story when it destroys the Dalek leader of the Spiridon task force for failing to meet its mission objectives.

==Necros Daleks==
In ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]'' (1985) [[Davros]] creates an army of Dalek mutants by manipulating [[DNA]] extracted from humans on the planet Necros, where the terminally ill and the dead are being stored in [[suspended animation]].&lt;ref name="Revelation of the Daleks" /&gt; These Necros Daleks are portrayed in the serial as a rebel faction while the grey Daleks from the Dalek home-world of Skaro, seen in the final episode, serve the Supreme Dalek.&lt;ref name="Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide: Revelation of the Daleks" &gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/revelationdaleks/detail.shtml#Continuity |title=Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide: "Revelation of the Daleks" |last=Cornell |first=Paul |authorlink1=Paul Cornell |date=2003 |website=BBC Doctor Who website |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=9 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this serial Davros' life-support chair is shown hovering a short distance above the ground. In a later scene a Dalek kills two saboteurs from an elevated vantage point, implying that Daleks now share this capability. For DVD releases of the serial from 2005 onwards new shots were created to clarify that the Dalek is hovering.&lt;ref name="Dr. Who Restoration Team: Revelation of the Daleks" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.restoration-team.co.uk/ |title=DVD Releases: Revelation of the Daleks |last=Roberts |first=Steve |date=2005 |website=Doctor Who Restoration Team Website |access-date=31 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard Necros Dalek===
The Necros Dalek design features detail changes which distinguish it from the standard Mark 3 variant. The skirt angle is steeper at both the front and rear and the hemispheres have a smaller diameter. The shoulder section has only twenty slats, and is broader at the top which, when combined with the skirt, gives it a stockier look. The arm is shorter and the oval between the appendage boxes more elongated. The neck bin strip beneath the lower neck ring is quite distinct in this variant. Necros Daleks are painted light cream with gold hemispheres, shoulder mesh, neck bin mesh, arm and gun.&lt;ref name="Dalek6388: Revelation of the Daleks" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dalek6388.co.uk/revelation-of-the-daleks/ |title=Revelation of the Daleks |last1=Green |first1=Jon |last2=Rymill |first2=Gavin |date=2011 |website=Dalek6388 |access-date=21 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glass Dalek===
Making a single appearance in ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]'', a Glass Dalek is introduced as a transparent, embryonic version of a Necros Dalek in which a grotesquely mutating human head can be seen. It has four neck rings rather than three.&lt;ref name="Revelation of the Daleks" /&gt; It was manufactured primarily from clear Perspex.&lt;ref name="Dalek6388: Revelation of the Daleks" /&gt;

==Imperial Daleks==
[[Image:Imperial Dalek.jpg|thumb|alt=Refer to caption.|A Special Weapons Dalek followed by several Imperial Daleks. From ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]''.]]
In ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'' (1988) Davros, masquerading as the Dalek Emperor, has gained control of Skaro. He commands an army of Imperial Daleks, created by grafting [[bionic]] appendages onto the bodies of Kaled mutants.&lt;ref name="Remembrance of the Daleks" /&gt; The Supreme Dalek and its followers are now referred to by the Imperial Daleks as "renegades".

Imperial Daleks have a similar colour scheme to [[#Necros Daleks|Necros Daleks]], but the designs are otherwise quite distinct from one another and were realised using different sets of props

===Standard Imperial Dalek===
The Imperial Dalek shares a skirt design with the [[#Necros Daleks|Necros Dalek]]. In other respects it features many differences when compared with previous variants. It has a stepped fender incorporating a recessed bottom section and integrally moulded collars and slats with no shoulder mesh. There are circular bosses around the appendage ball joints, a hexagonal panel between the appendage boxes, a re-modelled eye and eye discs, a mirrored eye lens with a small gold pupil, flush dome lights and a notched, funnel-like appendage instead of a plunger. The dome has a slightly larger diameter with a sharper angle where the bevelled section meets the curved upper part. The neck bin has a mirrored gold finish and is detailed with a fine circular-section gold mesh overlay, replacing the usual diamond section design. The props are painted predominantly light cream with gold hemisphere, slats, arm, "plunger", gun, eye discs and light covers.&lt;ref name="Dalek 6388: Remembrance of the Daleks" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dalek6388.co.uk/remembrance-of-the-daleks/ |title=Remembrance of the Daleks |last1=Green |first1=Jon |last2=Rymill |first2=Gavin |date=2011 |website=Dalek6388 |access-date=21 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hovering capability first seen in ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]'' is confirmed in ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'' when an Imperial Dalek is shown levitating up a staircase, emitting a red glow from the base of its casing.&lt;ref name="Remembrance of the Daleks" /&gt;

===Special Weapons Dalek===
The Special Weapons Dalek is a heavily armoured Imperial variant first seen in ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'' and later in "[[Asylum of the Daleks]]" (2012), "[[The Magician's Apprentice (Doctor Who)|The Magician's Apprentice]]" (2015) and "[[The Witch's Familiar]]" (2015). It has no manipulator arm, eye-stalk or dome lights, the latter items being replaced by an encircling row of small, square, translucent ports set around a foreshortened neck section and beneath a truncated dome. In "The Witch's Familiar" the ports are shown to glow with an orange light when the Dalek speaks. It is equipped with a large energy cannon mounted on the front of the casing, which in ''Remembrance of the Daleks'' is portrayed completely vaporising two conventional Daleks with a single shot, leaving only scorch marks on the ground. The armour is seen deflecting conventional Dalek weapon fire without suffering damage.&lt;ref name="Remembrance of the Daleks" /&gt; Like other Imperial Daleks its livery is white with gold hemispheres, but with a metallic grey colour applied to most of the upper section. The casing appears battle-scarred and far dirtier than other Daleks, which are usually shown in a clean condition.&lt;ref name="Dalek 6388: Remembrance of the Daleks" /&gt;

The BBC ''Dalek Survival Guide'' book maintains that this variant's weapon is fifty times more powerful than a regular Dalek blaster. It notes that Special Weapons Daleks are almost always directly controlled by Dalek commanders and rarely allowed autonomy, except in desperate situations, as they are as likely to fire on fellow Daleks as the enemy.&lt;ref name="Dalek Survival Guide" &gt;{{cite book |last1=Richards |first1=Justin |authorlink1=Justin Richards |date=2002 |title=Dalek Survival Guide |location=London |publisher=[[BBC Worldwide]] |pages=52–54 |isbn=0-563-48600-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ben Aaronovitch]]'s novelisation of ''Remembrance'' it is stated that the enormous power source required for the Special Weapons Dalek's gun resulted in the release of high levels of radiation which altered the structure of the Dalek creature's brain, causing insanity. Consequently, other Daleks shun it, ironically for being a mutant, naming it "the Abomination". The novel states that the Special Weapons Dalek is used only in extreme situations and only the Emperor can maintain complete control over it.&lt;ref name="Remembrance of the Daleks Novel" &gt;{{cite book |last=Aaronovitch |first=Ben |authorlink=Ben Aaronovitch |date=1990 |title=[[Remembrance of the Daleks#In print|Doctor Who: Remembrance of the Daleks]] |series=[[List of Doctor Who novelisations#List of novelisations published by Target|Target Novelisations]] |number=148 |location=London |publisher=[[Target Books]] |isbn=0-426-20337-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Special Weapons Dalek is also mentioned in the novel ''[[War of the Daleks]]''.&lt;ref name="War of the Daleks" &gt;{{cite book |last=Peel |first=John |authorlink=John Peel (writer) |date=1997 |title=Doctor Who: [[War of the Daleks]] |series=[[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] |number=5 |location=London |publisher=[[BBC Books]] |isbn=0-563-40573-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Big Finish audio production ''[[The Genocide Machine]]''.&lt;ref name=Genocide &gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Mike Tucker]] (writer), [[Nicholas Briggs]] (director), [[Gary Russell]], Jason Haigh-Ellery (producers) |date=April 2000 |id=7 |title=''[[The Genocide Machine]]'' |medium=CD |location= Berkshire |publisher=[[Big Finish Productions]] |isbn=1-84435-069-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[#The Dark Dimension Dalek|The Dark Dimension Dalek]].

===Imperial Dalek Emperor {{anchor|Dalek Emperor (1988)}}===
[[Image:Davros - Emperor Dalek .jpg|thumb|alt=A cream-coloured Dalek with a spherical head section and no appendages. The hemispheres and detailing around the dome midsection are painted in gold.|Davros posing as the Dalek Emperor, from ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]''.]]
The Emperor of the Imperial Dalek faction features in ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]''. During the serial it is revealed that it contains the [[History of the Daleks#Origins|Kaled]] Davros, rather than a Dalek mutant.&lt;ref name="Remembrance of the Daleks" /&gt; With only his head and partial torso visible, he is carried in a life support casing similar in design to the [[#Golden Emperor Dalek|''TV21'' comic version of the Dalek Emperor]]. The travel machine has no appendages. A translucent hexagonal panel is located centrally on the front of the dome, in a position approximating that where an eye stalk would be mounted on a standard Dalek casing. A strip-light is mounted vertically behind it, which scans from side to side when the Emperor speaks. The front upper section of the dome is shown to operate like a visor, retracting upward and to the rear to reveal Davros within.

==Renegade Daleks==
In ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'' (1988) the Imperial Daleks are opposed by "Renegade Daleks". Most of the Renegades seen in the serial are of the [[#Necros Daleks|Necros Dalek]] design but with the prominent neck bin strip below the lower neck ring removed. The shoulder mesh is also coarser than that previously seen, resembling a perforated, solid material. Renegade drones are painted grey with a black fender, hemispheres, collars, slats and appendages. A Renegade Supreme Dalek also appears, being a BBC promotional prop made by Martin Wilkie and Lorne Martin. It too is primarily based on the Necros design but with a different collar, slat, mesh and neck bin arrangement. It is further differentiated by having a small eyeball and orange dome lights and appears in a black paint scheme with silver neck rings, neck struts, hemispheres, collars, mesh and slats.&lt;ref name="Dalek 6388: Remembrance of the Daleks" /&gt;

''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'' was the Daleks' last appearance in the "classic" ''Doctor Who'' series, with the programme being put on hiatus by the BBC after December 1989.

=="New Series" Daleks==
After a break of fifteen years from regular production (there was a [[Doctor Who (film)|1996 ''Doctor Who'' television movie]] in which the Daleks were heard but not seen), ''Doctor Who'' returned to British television in March 2005. The sixth episode of the "new series" first season, "[[Dalek (Doctor Who episode)|Dalek]]", featured a lone Dalek, the survivor of a [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] which had ended in the mutual annihilation of both the Daleks and the Doctor's race, the [[Time Lord]]s. While the "New Series" Dalek retains the same basic shape and proportions of its forebears, almost every component has been re-designed to give it a more solid look.&lt;ref name="Dalek" /&gt; The updated appearance was the result of input from ''Doctor Who'' executive producer [[Russell T Davies]], artist [[Bryan Hitch]] and production designer Edward Thomas, with the design being realised by art department assistant designer Matthew Savage.&lt;ref name="Tucker" &gt;{{cite journal |last=Arnopp |first=Jason |date=July 2005 |title=Tucker's Luck |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] Special Edition |publisher=[[Panini Comics]] |location=Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent |issue=11 |pages=62–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first batch of "New Series" Dalek props were constructed by special effects company The Model Unit under the direction of [[Mike Tucker]],&lt;ref name="The Model Unit" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themodelunit.co.uk/ |title=The Model Unit Portfolio: Doctor Who – Dalek/The Parting Of The Ways, BBC1 |date=2009 |website=Model Unit Effects Limited |access-date=7 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with later builds being undertaken by Specialist Models,&lt;ref name="Specialist Models" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.specialistmodels.co.uk/original-dr-who-dalek-cardiff-and-co-photoshoot/work |title=BBC Wales Dr Who Daleks Fibreglass Props |date=2013 |website=Specialist Models &amp; Displays |access-date=27 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 'propmaker.co.uk'&lt;ref name="PropMaker" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.propmaker.co.uk/index.php/portfolio/ |title=propmaker.co.uk: Portfolio |date=2016 |website=Propmaker.co.uk |access-date=18 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rubbertoe Props.&lt;ref name="Rubbertoe" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rubbertoeprops.com/our-work?lightbox=image1mdv |title=Rubbertoe Props: Large Props |date=2012 |website=Rubbertoe Props |access-date=30 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard Dalek===
The standard "New Series" Dalek design incorporates additional detailing to many of the components including the dome, gun, appendage boxes, plunger and eyeball. The fender is larger with a bevelled edge, the lower collar is integral to the casing and the upper collar and mesh are omitted, being replaced by a raised shoulder section beneath the neck bin. The slats have an indented central channel running down their length and the neck bin mesh has a denser, more complex design. The dome lights are substantially larger and enclosed in metal cages and the eye stalk pivot is surrounded by a cowl, below which is a horizontal oblong depression containing an [[ideogram]] unique to each Dalek. The standard "New Series" Dalek is finished in a metallic bronze colour scheme.

This Dalek design exhibits previously unseen abilities, many of which are realised using [[computer-generated imagery]].&lt;ref name="DWC 1/6"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Dalek |series=[[Doctor Who Confidential]] |series-no=1 |number=6 |credits=[[Simon Pegg]] (narrator), Adam Page (director), Adam Page (producer), Gillane Seaborne (series producer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC Three (former)|BBC Three]] |airdate=30 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The casing has a swivelling midsection incorporating the appendage boxes, providing a 360-degree field of fire. It can also open by splitting down the front centreline to reveal the mutant within. In "[[Dalek (Doctor Who episode)|Dalek]]" (2005) the hemispheres are shown to be recessed spheres and components of a self-destruct mechanism. They are able to separate from the Dalek's casing and create an encircling sphere of energy within which the Dalek is destroyed without trace.&lt;ref name="Dalek" /&gt; The plunger has been transformed into a versatile tool with an adaptable shape which can interface with keyboards and control mechanisms, upload data, drain power and crush a man's skull.

"New Series" Daleks have been shown flying both in the vacuum of space and planetary atmospheres. They can regenerate by absorbing residual radiation and DNA from a time-traveller who touches them ("[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]" (2006))&lt;ref name="Doomsday" /&gt; and have a [[force field (fiction)|force field]] which can disintegrate bullets before they strike the casing. The height of the new design was chosen so that the eye stalk would be level with the eyes of the Doctor's companion [[Rose Tyler]], as portrayed by actress [[Billie Piper]].&lt;ref name="DWC 5/3" /&gt;

Three minor variations to the standard "new series" design have been shown. The single Dalek seen in "Dalek" differs from those appearing in subsequent episodes in that the lower shoulder collar is the same brass colour as its slats, instead of being bronze. A Dalek is seen in "[[The Parting of the Ways]]" (2005) with its plunger replaced by a spherical appendage incorporating a three-pincer claw and an extendable cutting torch. The story shows it being used by the Dalek force invading the [[Satellite 5]] [[space station]] to breach an internal blast door.&lt;ref name="The Parting of the Ways" /&gt; The toy manufacturer [[Doctor Who merchandise#Character Options|Character Options]] has used the term "Assault Dalek" on promotional material and packaging for licensed scale Dalek action figures having the claw/cutter appendage.&lt;ref name="Howe's TTB 2006-08" &gt;{{cite book |last1=Howe |first1=David J. |authorlink1=David J.

Their casings are painted in camouflage green with a [[Union Jack]] replacing the identifying ideogram on the dome front. Canvas ammunition pouches are fixed around the shoulders and in one scene a Dalek is shown operating outdoors with opaque fabric covers fitted over its dome lights. The Daleks are also seen carrying a tea tray and box files with their plungers angled upward, an ability not previously demonstrated. These Daleks are referred to as "Ironsides" in the story.&lt;ref name="Victory of the Daleks" &gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Victory of the Daleks]] |series=[[Doctor Who]] |series-no=5 |number=3 |credits=[[Mark Gatiss]] (writer), [[Andrew Gunn (director)|Andrew Gunn]] (director) , [[Peter Bennett (producer)|Peter Bennett]] (producer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=17 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emperor's personal guard===

Some of the guards are also differentiated by the replacement of the standard plunger with a metallic sphere, on the front of which is a glowing lens. In some instances the sphere is held by blade-like projections while the support for a second, larger type is provided by a tubular framework.&lt;ref name="The Parting of the Ways" /&gt; These specialised appendages are not referred to or shown in use during the episode, nor is their purpose explained.

The packaging for the Character Options 12" radio control model of the Emperor's Guard variant identifies the device as a "multiple spectrum sensor arm".&lt;ref name="Howe's TTB 2006-08" /&gt;

===Emperor Dalek {{anchor|Dalek Emperor (2005)}}===
An Emperor Dalek features in the 2005 series finale "[[The Parting of the Ways]]". Escaping the Time War which resulted in the apparent destruction of both the Daleks and Time Lords alike, its ship had fallen through time and space to the edge of Earth's [[Solar System]]. Having then recreated the Dalek race this Emperor regards itself as an immortal god and the Daleks worship it as such.&lt;ref name="The Parting of the Ways" /&gt; The Emperor Dalek mutant floats in a transparent cylindrical tank below a large dome which is adorned with lights and an eyestalk. Two mechanical arms are mounted to the base of the tank. The central structure is connected by articulated joints to three flanking panels, to which large hemispheres are attached.

''Doctor Who'' production designer Edward Thomas was responsible for the overall appearance of the Emperor Dalek, with the design being realised by assistant designers Dan Walker and Matthew Savage.&lt;ref name="NSD Emperor Design" &gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/episodes/S1_13 |title=Building The Emperor: Interview with model unit supervisor Mike Tucker |date=2005 |website=BBC Doctor Who Website |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=9 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor's casing was produced as a 1:6 scale model by The Model Unit,&lt;ref name="The Model Unit" /&gt; while the Emperor Dalek mutant was an [[Animatronics|animatronic puppet]], again in 1:6 scale, created by visual effects specialist [[Neill Gorton]].

===Cult of Skaro===
{{Main|Cult of Skaro}}
The Cult of Skaro is introduced in "[[Army of Ghosts]]" (2006) as an elite order of Daleks specifically engineered to use initiative and think like the enemy. They are the first recurring Dalek characters in the history of the ''Doctor Who'' television programme. Unlike other Daleks the four members of the Cult have individual names; Sec, Thay, Jast and Caan. While Daleks Thay, Jast and Caan appear identical to other Daleks, Dalek Sec is distinguished by a black casing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Army of Ghosts]] |series=[[Doctor Who]] |series-no=2 |number=12 |credits=[[Russell T Davies]] (writer), [[Graeme Harper]] (director), [[Phil Collinson]] (producer)|network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=1 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cult are shown to possess a sense of individuality and the ability to initiate an "emergency temporal shift" to escape danger by travelling through time and space. In "[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]" a combination of three plungers are used to extract information from a person's mind with lethal results (although it is implied that this can be done without killing the victim).&lt;ref name="Doomsday" /&gt; In the episode "[[Daleks in Manhattan]]" (2007) the plungers of the Cult of Skaro Daleks are used to detect the intelligence of human subjects, and in one scene a plunger is temporarily replaced by a syringe-like device.&lt;ref name="Daleks in Manhattan" /&gt; The BBC book ''Doctor Who Files: The Cult of Skaro '' states that Dalek Sec's black casing is constructed from "Metalert", an enhanced form of Dalekanium reinforced with flidor gold and sap from the extinct Arkellis flower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kemp |first1=Matt |last2=Richards |first2=Justin |authorlink2=Justin Richards |date=2007 |title=Doctor Who Files: The Cult of Skaro |series=Doctor Who Files |number=11 |location=London |publisher=BBC Children's Books / [[the Penguin Group]] |pages=6, 45 |isbn=978-1-4059-0312-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This fictional material and its constituents have their origins in the ''[[TV Century 21]]'' Dalek comic strip from 1965, where they are mentioned in the stories ''Duel of the Daleks''&lt;ref name="Duel of the Daleks" &gt;{{cite comic |writer=[[Alan Fennell|Fennel, Alan]] |cowriters=[[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]] |artist=[[Richard E.

===Vault Dalek===
Appearing in the linked episodes "[[The Stolen Earth]]" (2008) and "[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]" (2008), Vault Daleks watch over [[Davros]] in the Vault of ''[[List of Doctor Who vehicles#Dalek craft|The Crucible]]'' space station, acting as both bodyguards and warders.&lt;ref name="The Stolen Earth" /&gt; Although unnamed during the episodes in which they appear, the term is used for the variant on the BBC's Doctor Who website.&lt;ref name="Who's That Dalek" /&gt; Character Options named its licensed scale toys of the variant "Crucible Daleks".&lt;ref name="Howe's TTB 2006-08" /&gt;

Vault Daleks form part of the recreated Dalek race each of which, Davros states, has been genetically engineered with cells taken from his own body. Instead of the standard plunger they are fitted with a claw-like appendage incorporating eight "pincers", which are shown to fit directly into some of the ship's controls.

===Supreme Dalek===
[[image:Supreme Dalek (15981194015).jpg|thumb|right|The Supreme Dalek prop on display at the [[Doctor Who exhibitions#Permanent exhibitions|Doctor Who Experience]], December 2014.]]
A Supreme Dalek appears in "The Stolen Earth" and "Journey's End" (2008), and "[[The Magician's Apprentice (Doctor Who)|The Magician's Apprentice]]" and "[[The Witch's Familiar]]" (2015) as leader of the Dalek forces, outranking even Davros. This variant is a radical departure from the standard "New Series" design. It is painted red with gold hemispheres, collar and neck rings. It has three plinth-mounted dome lights featuring cages with three, rather than four uprights, and large golden struts connecting its shoulders to an extended neck bin. Its voice is deeper than the other Daleks, resembling that of the 2005 series' Dalek Emperor. [[Nicholas Briggs]], who provided the voice talent for the Dalek, stated that he adopted a grandiose delivery for the Supreme Dalek to fit his perception of the character as being egotistical.&lt;ref name="DWC 4/12"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Friends and Foe |series=[[Doctor Who Confidential]] |series-no=4 |number=12 |credits=[[Anthony Head]] (narrator), Adam Page (director), Adam Page (producer), Producer Gillane Seaborne (series producer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC Three (former)|BBC Three]] |airdate=28 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Dalek was designed by ''Doctor Who'' production designer Edward Thomas, realised by design assistant Peter McKinstry &lt;ref name="Supreme Dalek Design" &gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/episodes/S4_12 |title=Concept Art Description: Supreme Dalek |last=McKinstry |first=Peter |date=2008 |website=BBC Doctor Who Website |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=9 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and created by "propmaker.co.uk".&lt;ref name="PropMaker" /&gt;

==New Paradigm Daleks==
In "[[Victory of the Daleks]]" (2010) five examples of a new Dalek variant are introduced, described in the narrative as forming "a new Dalek [[paradigm]]". They are created from pure Dalek DNA contained in a device called a "Progenitor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tribe |first1=Steve |last2=Goss |first2=James |authorlink2=James Goss (producer) |date=2011 |title=The Dalek Handbook |location=London |publisher=[[BBC Books]] |pages=143, 145, 146 |isbn=978-1-84990-232-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their design is the result of input from ''Doctor Who'' executive producer [[Steven Moffat]], production designer Edward Thomas, "Victory of the Daleks" writer [[Mark Gatiss]] and concept artist Peter McKinstry.&lt;ref name=" Restoration of the Daleks Article" /&gt; The props were produced by the BBC Art Department under the supervision of senior prop maker Barry Jones.&lt;ref name="The Brilliant Book 2011" &gt;{{cite book |last=Hickman |first=Clayton |authorlink=Clayton Hickman |date=2010 |title=The Brilliant Book of Doctor Who 2011 |location=London |publisher=[[BBC Books]] / [[Ebury Press]] |pages=122–125 |isbn=978-1-84607-991-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the five New Paradigm variants has a casing of a different colour, representing their role in Dalek society: red, Drone; blue, Strategist; orange, Scientist; yellow, Eternal and white, Supreme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tribe |first1=Steve |last2=Goss |first2=James |authorlink2=James Goss (producer) |date=2011 |title=The Dalek Handbook |location=London |publisher=[[BBC Books]] |page=152 |isbn=978-1-84990-232-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on the programme ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'', ''Doctor Who'' Executive Producer Steven Moffat stated that the function of the Eternal Dalek had yet to be decided, while writer Mark Gatiss confirmed that the bright colours of the New Paradigm Daleks were inspired by the Daleks seen in the 1960s [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)|Amicus films]].&lt;ref name="DWC 5/3" /&gt;

New Paradigm Daleks are taller than previous variants, having a substantial fender reminiscent of [[#Dalek variants in films|Movie Daleks]]. The skirt section consists of raised panels with bevelled edges to which forty-eight hemispheres are fixed in twelve columns. The hemispheres are coloured grey with the exception of the Eternal Dalek, where they are black. The central rear skirt panel is enlarged to form a broad spine featuring a recessed horizontal louvre assembly. Published design drawings and commentary by concept artist Peter McKinstry indicates that this section is capable of opening to deploy alternative weapons which would traverse around the midsection to replace the standard armament, although this has not been portrayed on screen.&lt;ref name="Restoration of the Daleks Article" &gt;{{cite journal |last=Berry |first=Dan |date=April 2010 |title=Restoration of the Daleks |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=421 |pages=50–55 |location=Royal Tunbridge Wells |publisher=[[Marvel UK]] |issn=0957-9818 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The skirt is surmounted by a prominent, slatless shoulder section, divided by a horizontal groove and featuring integral appendage boxes. The neck is devoid of struts and consists of four flared rings detailed with small vertical slots, and is mounted towards the front of the Dalek giving the appearance of a prominent hump to the rear shoulder section. The dome, to which two cylindrical lights are fitted, is missing the chamfered lower section applied to previous variants. The gun is larger than that previously seen on the programme and is shown causing the complete disintegration of another Dalek. The eye design features five closely spaced discs of identical diameter behind an eyeball, inset with horizontal fins, on the front of which is a veined "organic" lens which glows with a yellow light. It is mounted to the dome on a [[ball joint]].&lt;ref name="Victory of the Daleks" /&gt;

Two variations on the New Paradigm design have been shown. The [[Doctor Who (series 5)|Series 5]] finale "[[The Big Bang (Doctor Who)|The Big Bang]]" features a pair of [[fossil]]ised New Paradigm 'Stone Daleks' having the appearance of severely weathered statues. They are remnants left when, in the episode, most of history is erased by the destruction of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[The Big Bang (Doctor Who)|The Big Bang]] |series=[[Doctor Who]] ||series-no=5 |number=13 |credits=[[Steven Moffat]] (writer), [[Toby Haynes]] (director), [[Peter Bennett (producer)|Peter Bennett]] (producer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=28 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Stone Dalek is derived from a listing in the episode credits. In the [[Doctor Who (series 7)|Series 7]] episode "[[Asylum of the Daleks]]" red Drone and blue Strategist Daleks are shown with their original bright colour schemes replaced by a deeper, metallic hue. The rear of the props are also seen with minor modifications, rendering the spine slightly less prominent.&lt;ref name="Asylum of the Daleks"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Asylum of the Daleks]] |series=[[Doctor Who]] |series-no=7 |number=1 |credits=[[Steven Moffat]] (writer), [[Nick Hurran]] (director), Marcus Wilson (producer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=1 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of the New Paradigm Daleks proved to be controversial and failed to generate much enthusiasm among fans of the TV series. In 2015, commenting on the introduction of the New Paradigm, Moffat said "Well I suppose if I'm completely honest - and it's all my fault, no one else's fault - I don't think that was a great idea. When I looked at them in person I thought 'My God, the new Daleks are awesome. they're so huge and powerful, they're brilliant.' But I learned a grave lesson: which is that when you put them on screen, of course, they don't look bigger, they just make all the other Daleks look smaller." Moffat stated that the New Paradigm Daleks hadn't been abandoned, however. "...I now consider them an officer class of Dalek." "They haven't gone away. We still have them. But that's the answer. The answer to most questions I find is that I've made a mistake."&lt;ref name="Moffat Interview" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-11-15/doctor-who-boss-steven-moffat-admits-the-colourful-new-paradigm-daleks-were-a-mistake |title=Doctor Who boss Steven Moffat admits the colourful New Paradigm Daleks were "a mistake" |author=Stephen Kelly |date=15 November 2015 |website=RadioTimes |publisher=[[Immediate Media Company]] |access-date=17 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dalek hybrids==
[[Hybrid (biology)|Hybridisation]] between Daleks and human beings has been a recurring theme in the ''Doctor Who'' television programme since the 1960s.

===Physical Hybrids===
In ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]'' (1985) [[Davros]] creates a new breed of Dalek mutants to command. He uses as source material the severed heads of terminal human medical patients in the Tranquil Repose [[mausoleum]] and suspended animation facility on the planet Necros. During the early stages of the conversion process the victims retain some memory and awareness of their humanity, but by the end of the metamorphosis they have become fully Dalek in nature, if not appearance.&lt;ref name="Revelation of the Daleks" /&gt;

In "[[Dalek (Doctor Who episode)|Dalek]]" (2005) a dying Dalek's casing is touched by [[Rose Tyler]], a companion of the Doctor. During this brief physical contact the Dalek absorbs enough of her DNA to regenerate itself and its damaged travel machine. It later becomes apparent that this genetic material has caused it to mutate further, as it begins to experience human emotions. It finally becomes trapped in an agony of conflict and self-loathing, and destroys itself.&lt;ref name="Dalek" /&gt;
	
In "[[The Parting of the Ways]]" (2005) the [[#Emperor Dalek|Emperor Dalek]] and the few surviving members of its crew hide in space for centuries after the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], harvesting organic material from captured humans and genetically manipulating it to rebuild their race. The Emperor tells the Doctor that a new Dalek army has been created using "filleted, pulped and sifted" human bodies, although they still consider themselves to be "...pure and blessed Dalek".&lt;ref name="The Parting of the Ways" /&gt; When a Dalek is destroyed and the mutant revealed it is of a different appearance to the mutant seen in "[[Dalek]]", the prop hinting at a human heritage. Mutants originating from Kaled stock appear to have a closed, vestigial second eye, set below and to one side of the sighted eye. The mutant in "The Parting of the Ways" seems to have two identical symmetrically set eyes above which is a prominent [[supraorbital ridge]]. A large fleshy mass protrudes below the eyes, with folds suggestive of a mouth-like orifice.

[[Image:Human dalek.jpg|thumb|alt=An alien creature with a vertically elongated head, small mouth, prominent chin and large exposed brain. A single grey eye is set centrally in the face, with tentacles protruding from the sides of the head. It wears a black shirt, tie and black pinstripe jacket.|The Dalek Sec – Human/Dalek Hybrid as seen in "Daleks in Manhattan" and "Evolution of the Daleks"]]

In the two-part story "[[Daleks in Manhattan]]" and "[[Evolution of the Daleks]]" (2007) the [[Cult of Skaro]], stranded in 1930s America following an emergency temporal shift, attempt to rebuild the Dalek race.&lt;ref name="Daleks in Manhattan" /&gt; Their leader, Dalek Sec, traps in its casing [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#D|Mr. Diagoras]], a human collaborator, and merges with him to become a Human/Dalek hybrid. The process results in a mutated humanoid creature with fingers tapered to points, a large, exposed brain and a single eye set in a face framed by six thick tentacles. The voice is an amalgam of human and Dalek characteristics.&lt;ref name="Evolution of the Daleks"&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Evolution of the Daleks]] |series=[[Doctor Who]] |series-no=3 |number=5 |credits=[[Helen Raynor]] (writer), [[James Strong (director)|James Strong]] (director), [[Phil Collinson]] (producer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=28 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sec then orders that hybrids should be created having human bodies and emotions, coupled with Dalek intelligence, to eradicate the Daleks' obsession with universal supremacy which has led them to the brink of extinction. Believing that Daleks should remain pure and Sec is now a traitor to their race, the other Cult members bind it in chains and adjust the conversion process to produce hybrids which are completely Dalek in nature. Sec is killed preventing Cult member Dalek Thay from exterminating the Doctor.

The episode "[[Asylum of the Daleks]]" (2012) introduces the Dalek planet Asylum where a young woman, [[Clara Oswald|Oswin Oswald]], has become trapped following a spaceship crash. A [[List of Doctor Who items#N|nanogene]] cloud, designed to convert all other life forms to serve the planet's security system, completely transforms her into a Dalek to preserve her genius-level intellect for Dalek use. Oswin is initially unaware of her condition, having created the self-delusion of continuing humanity to protect herself from the horror of her situation. Ultimately she is able to overcome her re-emergent Dalek personality and assist the Doctor and his companions to escape the planet. She perishes when the Daleks destroy the Asylum from space.&lt;ref name="Asylum of the Daleks" /&gt;

===Mental Hybrids===
In ''[[The Evil of the Daleks]]'' (1967) the Daleks trap the Doctor into identifying the "Dalek Factor", which determines their species' unquestioning obedience to Dalek ideology and aggressive, pitiless nature. With the aid of a "converted" Doctor they plan to impregnate all of humanity throughout Earth's history with the Dalek Factor, transforming them into "Human Daleks". When, in the story, some Daleks are implanted with the "Human Factor" they lose their aggressive traits and begin to question authority, leading to a catastrophic civil war.&lt;ref name="The Evil of the Daleks" /&gt;

In the two-part story "[[Daleks in Manhattan]]" and "[[Evolution of the Daleks]]" (2007) the [[Cult of Skaro]] attempt to rebuild the Dalek race using Human-Dalek DNA to "format" the brains of thousands of captured people who have had their minds erased. The scheme fails due to the contamination of the Human Daleks with the Doctor's DNA, causing them to question their orders and Dalek ideology. After two of the Cult members are destroyed by the Human Daleks during a fire-fight, the remaining Dalek, Caan, declares the hybrids to be a failure and transmits a destruct signal, killing them.

In "[[The Witch's Familiar]]" (2015), Davros attempts to use the Doctor's [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration energy]] to transform every Dalek on [[Skaro]] into Dalek-[[Time Lord]] hybrids. The plan fails when the rotting remains of aged Daleks, which have been discarded in the sewers of the Dalek city, are reanimated by the energy and attack the functional Daleks in revenge.

===Dalek "Puppets"===
Dalek "puppets" are portrayed as life forms converted to serve the Daleks, often covertly. They retain their original, physical form and limited memories from the host, while being endowed with extendable Dalek appendages which are deployed by bursting outward through the skin. Dalek control of the puppets is usually absolute, although a few individual examples have been depicted breaking their mental conditioning and regaining their free will.
	
First appearing in "[[Asylum of the Daleks]]" (2012), humanoids are stated to have been converted to Dalek puppets by nanogenes to act as part of the planet Asylum's security system.&lt;ref name="Asylum of the Daleks" /&gt; In the novel ''[[The Dalek Generation]]'' (2013), a child, Jenibeth Blakely, is held prisoner by the Daleks for almost ninety years, during which time she is transformed into a Dalek puppet. Hybrids of this type next appear in the episode "[[The Time of the Doctor]]" (2013), where the crew of the spacecraft ''Church of the Papal Mainframe'' are killed by the Daleks during the battle for the planet [[List of Doctor Who planets#T|Trenzalore]] and turned into Dalek puppets.&lt;ref name="The Time of the Doctor" &gt;{{cite episode |title=[[The Time of the Doctor]] |series=[[Doctor Who]] |credits=[[Steven Moffat]] (writer), Jamie Payne (director), Marcus Wilson (producer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=25 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[The Magician's Apprentice (Doctor Who)|The Magician's Apprentice]]" (2015), Bors, a human friend of the Doctor from the year 1138, is revealed to be a Dalek puppet tasked by his masters with obtaining the [[TARDIS]].

==Dalek variants in films==
Capitalising on the wave of "[[Dalekmania]]" gripping Britain following their initial appearances in the ''Doctor Who'' programme, [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)|two films featuring the Daleks]] were produced: ''[[Dr. Who and the Daleks]]'' (1965) and ''[[Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.]]'' (1966). The storylines for these movies are essentially identical to the first two TV serials in which the Daleks were seen, with the primary exception that the protagonist is portrayed as an eccentric human inventor with the surname "Who" rather than an alien. Consequently, these Dalek appearances and variants exist in a continuity unique to the film series.

===Mark 1 Movie Daleks===
First appearing in the film ''[[Dr. Who and the Daleks]]'', Movie Daleks have substantial fenders, very similar in shape and design to those seen in the ''Doctor Who'' serial ''[[The Dalek Invasion of Earth]]''. The skirt sits directly on top of the enlarged fender, however, without the intervening step created by the original TV variant base. The appendage boxes are angled slightly differently and the neck ring edges have a steeper bevel.&lt;ref name="Dalek6388: First Dalek Film" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dalek6388.co.uk/dr-who-and-the-daleks-film/ |title=The 'Doctor Who and the Daleks' Movie |last1=Green |first1=Jon |last2=Rymill |first2=Gavin |date=2011 |website=Dalek6388 |access-date=21 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The eyestalk has only five discs, most irises are illuminated and the dome lights are considerably larger than those seen on TV Daleks of the period.&lt;ref name="The Dalek Movies" &gt;{{cite journal |last=Holliss |first=Richard |date=January 1984 |title=The Dalek Movies |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine|Doctor Who Monthly]] |issue=84 |pages=20–34 |location=Royal Tunbridge Wells |publisher=[[Marvel UK]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another distinctive design feature is the gun, which has a wider bore than the TV counterpart, lacks mantles and is depicted as projecting a pressurised jet of destructive, lethal vapour rather than an energy discharge.

Three minor Dalek variants appear in the film. Some Daleks are fitted with a two-jawed mechanical claw instead of a plunger, some have integrally moulded collars with reversed angles on the front edges and one is seen with a cutting torch instead of a telescopic arm.

While hemisphere misalignment is an occasionally recurring feature of Daleks seen on television, this issue presents itself in a uniform manner with all of the film props. Most noticeably the four hemispheres on the rear-left corner skirt panel are set higher than those on the other panels.

For their first film appearance the Dalek props were painted in bold colours. Drones are primarily silver with mid-blue domes, hemispheres and fenders, and gold collars. The Dalek leader is black with alternating silver and gold hemispheres, alternating silver and gold neck rings, and gold collars and fender. Its second in command is portrayed as a red Dalek with black hemispheres, gold collars and a gold fender. On all versions the dome lights are coloured red.

The [[Theatrical property#Modern usage|hero props]] seen in the film were constructed by Shawcraft Engineering while the Daleks with integrally moulded shoulder collars, which were mainly used to make up numbers in crowd scenes, were produced by the Plaster Workshops at [[Shepperton Studios]].&lt;ref name="The Dalek Movies" /&gt;

Three Mark 1 Movie Dalek props can occasionally be seen in the Doctor Who television serial ''The Chase'', hired from the production company responsible for the [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)|Doctor Who films]] to increase numbers.&lt;ref name="The Unauthorised Guide to DOCTOR WHO" &gt;{{cite book |last1=Howe |first1=David J. |authorlink1=David J. Howe |last2=Walker |first2=Stephen J. |date=2003 |title=The Television Companion: The Unofficial and Unauthorised Guide to DOCTOR WHO |edition=2nd |location=Prestatyn |publisher=[[Telos Publishing]] |isbn=1-903889-51-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some scenes their large fenders are missing, with the skirts sitting directly on the floor, and the large dome lights replaced with smaller items as used for the TV props. Their more striking colour scheme is not readily apparent due the filming of the serial in monochrome. As the film was not released until after ''The Chase'' was screened, this television appearance is the first occasion that the film props were seen by the public. 

===Mark 2 Movie Daleks===
The Dalek variant seen in the film ''[[Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.]]'' is similar in design to the Mark 1 version but with the addition of the upper collar mesh and slats with which the TV versions were by now equipped. At various points in the film a Dalek can be seen with a small silver plunger in place of the usual black item. Another features a scissor-like claw instead of the standard "[[G-clamp]]"-shaped device and a gun with mantles. These unusual appendages are not referred to in the story.&lt;ref name="The Dalek Collection" &gt;{{cite AV media |people=Writers [[Terry Nation]], [[Milton Subotsky]], [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]]; Director [[Gordon Flemyng]]; Producers [[Max Rosenberg|Max J. Rosenberg]], Milton Subotsky |date=2006 |title=The Dalek Collection (Dr Who and the Daleks &amp; Daleks – Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D. |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060278/ |access-date=14 January 2010 |medium=DVD |publisher=Optimum Home Entertainment |location=London |id=OPTD0591 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The misalignment of the hemispheres, evident in ''Dr. Who and the Daleks'', is once again present.

The colour scheme for the drones used in the second film is essentially the same as that used for the television versions at the time, being silver with grey shoulders, natural aluminium collars and slats, blue hemispheres and a black fender. The narrative fails to establish a precise hierarchy for the Dalek commanders seen in the film. The leader of the expeditionary force appears to be a gold Dalek with natural aluminium collars and slats, black hemispheres and a black fender. A black Dalek with gold hemispheres, natural aluminium collars and slats and a black fender is in charge of a mining operation in Bedfordshire, while a red Dalek with natural aluminium collars and slats and a black fender with red topping is shown commanding a Dalek spaceship and operations to capture human slaves and wipe-out the resistance. Drones sport blue dome lights, the black and red Daleks have red dome lights and the gold Dalek has yellow dome lights. As for the first film, the Dalek props were constructed by Shawcraft Engineering.&lt;ref name="The Dalek Movies" /&gt;

==Dalek variants in the theatre==
Daleks with unique characteristics have appeared in stage productions consisting of both original works and adaptations of serials from the ''Doctor Who'' television programme. In addition to the professional productions detailed below a number of amateur presentations have been staged. These include ''[[Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday#Other productions|Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday]]'' (Porirua Little Theatre, Titahi Bay, Porirua, New Zealand, 1984),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nzdwfc.tetrap.com/archive/tsv61/sevenkeys.html |title=The Dalek Invasion of Porirua: 1984 |last=Hudson |first=Brian |date=2000 |website=archive.is - nzdwfc.tetrap.com |accessdate=12 December 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.fo/20120711183341/http://nzdwfc.tetrap.com/archive/tsv61/sevenkeys.html |archivedate=11 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Evil of the Daleks#On stage|The Evil of the Daleks]]'' ([[New Theatre Royal]], Portsmouth, England, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evilofthedaleks.co.uk/the-evil-of-the-daleks-stage-show.html |title=The Evil of the Daleks Stage Show |date=2008 |website= The Evil of the Daleks Website |accessdate=20 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan#On stage|The Daleks' Master Plan]]'' (New Theatre Royal, Portsmouth, England, 2007).

===''The Curse of the Daleks'' (1965)===
''[[The Curse of the Daleks]]'' was a stage play written by [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]] and [[Terry Nation]] which appeared for one month at the [[Wyndham's Theatre]] in London, England beginning on 21 December 1965.

Five Daleks were used in the production; four silver/grey drones and a black version. Built by Shawcraft, the manufacturers of the original TV and Movie props, they were of the basic Mark 1 Movie Dalek design but with fenders, dome lights and guns of the type seen on TV Daleks at the time.&lt;ref name="Dalek6388: The Curse of the Daleks" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dalek6388.co.uk/the-curse-of-the-daleks-stage-play/ |title='The Curse of the Daleks' Stage Play |last1=Green |first1=Jon |last2=Rymill |first2=Gavin |date=2007 |website=Dalek6388 |access-date=31 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday'' (1974)===
''[[Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday]]'' was a stage play written by [[Terrance Dicks]] which ran at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] in London, England for four weeks beginning on 16 December 1974.

Five Daleks were created for the play by Philip Poole and Phillip Alleston under the guidance of model maker, sculptor and film designer Allister Bowtell. They were of a similar design to the Supreme Dalek from ''[[Planet of the Daleks]]'', having flat-edged neck rings, a strutless neck bin and an enlarged fender. Turn-indicator style lights were used, with the gun stick rods being thinner and more angular than those fitted to either the TV or film variants.

Contemporary publicity photographs show [[Trevor Martin]], the actor portraying Doctor Who in the play, posing with the [[#Dalek Supreme|''Planet of the Daleks'' Supreme]] and a [[#Mark 2 movie Daleks|Mark 2 Movie Dalek]], with the latter prop displaying various alterations to its dome lights and appendages. Neither of these props actually appeared in the stage production.&lt;ref name="Dalek6388: Terry Nation's Daleks" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dalek6388.co.uk/terry-nations-daleks/ |title=Terry Nation's Daleks |last1=Green |first1=Jon |last2=Rymill |first2=Gavin |date=2011 |website=Dalek6388 |access-date=26 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Ultimate Adventure'' (1989)===
''[[Doctor Who – The Ultimate Adventure]]'' was a stage play written by Terrance Dicks. It toured Great Britain, appearing at twenty theatres between April and August 1989.

Four blue/grey drones and a Black Dalek (credited as "The Chief Dalek") appeared in the play. Specific design differences from the television version of the time included a skirt section flared more to the sides and less to the front and rear, a single vertical column of hemispheres on the skirt side panels and a higher fender. The props had large, rectangular dome lights, a bottom neck ring which protruded beyond the shoulder line, and lacked both eye discs and slats. These Daleks also featured a dome that was a true hemisphere rather than the usual bevelled design and a single, oblong appendage box running across the front of the body.

A Dalek Emperor prop was also created, being a scaled-down but otherwise faithful reproduction of the version that appeared in ''[[The Evil of the Daleks]]'' with the addition of large wing-like structures to the sides. The Dalek props used in the production were built by the theatrical suppliers Suffolk Scenery.&lt;ref name="Ultimate Dalek Builders" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theultimateadventure.co.uk/the-ultimate-adventure-daleks.html |title=The Daleks from The Ultimate Adventure |last=McCulloch |first=Gav |date=1989 |website=The Ultimate Adventure – Doctor Who Stageplay |publisher=theultimateadventure.co.uk |access-date=10 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dalek variants in comics, books, audio dramas and video games==
Various writers and artists have created new Dalek variants for media other than television, film and the theatre. The depiction of Daleks with coloured casings has also been used to indicate rank, although these differentiations do not constitute separate variants as such. Of particular note in this respect is [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]]'s [[BBC Books]] ''Doctor Who'' novel ''[[War of the Daleks]]'' in which grey, blue, red, black and gold Daleks are described as having successively higher status, all serving under the [[#Dalek Prime|Dalek Prime]].&lt;ref name="War of the Daleks" /&gt; Other examples are the [[TV Century 21|''TV21'']] Dalek comic strip in which a Black Dalek is shown acting as second-in-command to the [[#Golden Emperor Dalek|Golden Emperor]], and [[Trevor Baxendale]]'s novel ''[[Prisoner of the Daleks]]'' where a Dalek Inquisitor General is described as being of the "New Series" design but having a casing of gunmetal black with gold slats and hemispheres.&lt;ref name="Prisoner of the Daleks" &gt;{{cite book |last=Baxendale |first=Trevor |authorlink=Trevor Baxendale |date=2009 |title=Doctor Who: [[Prisoner of the Daleks]] |series=[[New Series Adventures]] |number=33 |location=London |publisher=[[BBC Books]] |pages=182–183 |isbn=978-1-84607-641-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Golden Emperor Dalek===
[[File:The_Golden_Emperor_Dalek.png|thumb|right|The Golden Emperor Dalek, as depicted by illustrator [[Ron Turner (illustrator)|Ron Turner]]]]The concept of an Emperor Dalek was first introduced in [[Dalek comic strips, illustrated annuals and graphic novels#The Dalek Book|''The Dalek Book'']] (1964),&lt;ref name="The Dalek Book p8" &gt;{{cite book |last1=Whitaker |first1=David |authorlink1=David Whitaker (screenwriter) |last2=Nation |first2=Terry |authorlink2=Terry Nation |date=1964 |title=[[Dalek comic strips, illustrated annuals and graphic novels#The Dalek Book|''The Dalek Book'']] |location=London |publisher=Panther Books Ltd. / Souvenir Press Ltd |page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; re-appearing shortly thereafter in the [[TV Century 21|''TV21'']] comic strip [[Dalek comic strips, illustrated annuals and graphic novels#TV Century 21|''The Daleks'']] (1965 – 1967).&lt;ref name="Altered Vistas – Doctorless Strips" &gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alteredvistas.co.uk/html/doctorless.html |title=In The Comics – Doctorless Strips : TV Century 21 – The Daleks |last=Palmer |first=Stuart |date=2012 |website=Altered Vistas |access-date=19 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the comic strip version of events the planet Skaro was inhabited by two warring humanoid species; the tall, peaceful [[Thals]] and the aggressive blue-skinned Daleks. The Daleks build a [[neutron bomb]] to finally destroy the Thals and bring the conflict to an end. A [[meteorite]] storm causes the device to detonate prematurely, devastating Skaro and the planet's civilisations. The only survivors of the Dalek race are the scientist Yarvelling and the warlord Zolfian. While exploring the shattered remains of their world they are attacked, and then interrogated, by a prototype war machine which Yarvelling had created shortly before the holocaust. It is implied that these machines were intended to act as semi-autonomous robotic warriors. It informs them that it is actually a mutated Dalek, the result of radiation from the neutron bomb explosion, which has commandeered the casing to use as a travel machine. It says that there are many more mutants and persuades Yarvelling and Zolfian to build more casings to house them. Before the last two humanoid Daleks die, exhausted by their labours and the effects of radiation, it appoints itself as Emperor and has a special casing constructed to reflect its new rank, made from "...Flidor gold, Quartz and Arkellis flower sap...".&lt;ref name="Genesis of Evil" /&gt; The Golden Emperor is usually depicted as being slightly shorter than a standard Dalek with a disproportionately large spherical head section.

The title page of ''The Dalek Book'' lists three contributing illustrators; [[Richard E. Jennings|Richard Jennings]], John Woods and A.B. Cornwell. As none of the stories are individually credited it is uncertain which artist or artists first developed the Golden Emperor design. Two illustrators provided interpretations of the Golden Emperor for the ''TV21'' comic strip; Jennings again, and [[Ron Turner (illustrator)|Ron Turner]] who superseded him in later instalments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Russell |first=Gary |date=4 August 1994 |title=The Dalek Chronicles Found! |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=Summer Special: The Dalek Chronicles |page=2 |location=Royal Tunbridge Wells |publisher=[[Marvel UK]] |editor1-first=Russell |editor1-last=Gary |editor1-link=Gary Russell |issn=1353-7628 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The Dalek Book" Daleks===
''The Dalek Book'' (1964) is notable, although not unique, in portraying a Dalek variant which has a "speaker grille" set centrally on the chest and, occasionally, a stylised numeral on the dome. Neither of these items has ever been incorporated in a Dalek variant shown on-screen.

During rehearsals for the first ''Doctor Who'' serial in which they appeared a numbered piece of card was taped to the dome of each Dalek prop to assist the director in distinguishing them, with a tape roll being wedged behind the top front collar for safekeeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peel |first1=John |authorlink1=John Peel (writer) |last2=Nation |first2=Terry |authorlink2=Terry Nation |date=1988 |title=The Official Doctor Who &amp; the Daleks Book |location=New York |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |page=19 |isbn=0-312-02264-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These objects subsequently appeared in reference photographs of the Daleks provided by the BBC to merchandise producers, with the illustrators of ''The Dalek Book'' interpreting them as speaker grilles and insignia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hearn |first=Marcus |date=23 November 2011 |title=The Dalek Chronicles |journal=[[SFX Magazine]] Collection |volume=2 |issue=Doctor Who: The Fanzine |page=124 |location=Bath |publisher=[[Future Publishing Ltd]] |isbn=1-85870-445-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the publication of this volume other merchandise and packaging appeared featuring Daleks with the speaker grille design element. These included Dalek board games, [[bagatelle]], "Cutta-Mastic" [[polystyrene]] sculpting sets, [[Labyrinth (marble game)|marble mazes]] and a ray gun torch.&lt;ref name="Richard's Memorabilia Collection" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richardwho.co.uk/collectors/vuser/index.asp?u=26 |title=Doctor Who Collectors: Richard in Essex |date=2009 |website=www.richardwho.com |access-date=18 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dalek Emperor===
A Dalek Emperor, described as being similar that seen in ''[[The Evil of the Daleks]]'', appears in the [[Telos Doctor Who novellas|Telos novella]] ''[[The Dalek Factor]]'' (2004) by [[Simon Clark (novelist)|Simon Clark]]. It is referred to as "an Emperor", implying there is more than one during the period in which the story is set.&lt;ref name="The Dalek Factor" &gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Clark (novelist) |date=2004 |title=[[The Dalek Factor]] |series=[[Telos Doctor Who novellas]] |number=15 |location=Prestatyn |publisher=[[Telos Publishing]] |isbn=1-903889-30-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dalek Prime===
A Dalek Prime is referred to in several of the novels based on ''Doctor Who'' serials (''[[The Chase (Doctor Who)#In print|The Chase]]'', ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan#In print|The Daleks' Master Plan]]'', ''[[The Power of the Daleks#In print|The Power of the Daleks]]'', ''[[The Evil of the Daleks#In print|The Evil of the Daleks]]''). It is also mentioned in John Peel's [[Eighth Doctor]] novels, ''[[War of the Daleks]]'' (1997)&lt;ref name="War of the Daleks" /&gt; and ''[[Legacy of the Daleks]]'' (1998).&lt;ref name="Legacy of the Daleks" &gt;{{cite book |last=Peel |first=John |authorlink=John Peel (writer) |date=1998 |title=[[Legacy of the Daleks]] |series=[[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] |number=10 |location=London |publisher=[[BBC Books]] |isbn=0-563-40574-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although portrayed as being a leader its precise position in the Dalek hierarchy is not made clear. In ''War of the Daleks'' its description closely matches that of the [[#Golden Emperor Dalek|''TV21'' Golden Emperor]].

===Dalek Time Controller===
The Dalek Time Controller features in the [[Big Finish Productions]] Doctor Who audio dramas ''[[Patient Zero (audio drama)|Patient Zero]]'' (2009), ''[[Lucie Miller / To the Death (audio drama)|Lucie Miller]]'' (2011), ''[[Lucie Miller / To the Death (audio drama)|To the Death]]'' (2011), ''[[Dark Eyes (audio drama)|Dark Eyes]]'' (2012), ''[[Dark Eyes 2]]'' (2014), ''[[Dark Eyes 4]]'' (2015) and the novel ''[[The Dalek Generation]]'' (2013). It is portrayed as being genetically engineered to have an enhanced perception of the space-time vortex, enabling it to direct Dalek strategies involving time travel while limiting temporal destabilisation. The novel describes it as the ultimate form of Dalek life, able to command even the Dalek Supreme, and having a neck bin encircled by diagonally revolving rings of vortex energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Briggs |first1=Nicholas |authorlink1=Nicholas Briggs |date=2013 |title=[[The Dalek Generation]] |series=[[New Series Adventures]] |number=50 |location=London |publisher=[[BBC Books]] |pages=25, 184 |isbn=978-1-84990-575-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dalek Time Controller is voiced in the audio productions by actor [[Nicholas Briggs]].

==="Hayakawa" Daleks===
[[Image:Japanese Dalek.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A truncated cone adorned with two encircling rows of small oval markings in a zigzag pattern, topped by a dome and with a large inverted hemisphere for a base. To one side of the cone is attached a device resembling a machine gun and to the other a rod terminating in a group of four spherical objects. Another rod projects from a vertical slot in the front of the dome, terminating in a disc-shaped eyeball.|"Hayakawa" Dalek variant.]]

Four of the [[Target Books]] ''Doctor Who'' serial novelisations were translated into Japanese by Yukio Sekiguchi and published in 1980 by Hayakawa Bunko books. These included [[The Daleks#In print|Doctor Who and the Daleks]] as {{nihongo|''Jikuu Daikettou!''|時空大血闘!||lit. "Big Bloody Space-Time Battle!"}}&lt;ref name="Jikuu Daikettou!" &gt;{{cite book |last=Sekiguchi |first=Yukio |date=1980 |title=Jikuu Daikettou!

Unlike other comic book and graphic artists whose work, however stylised, usually presents relatively minor variations to the standard Dalek form, Sato's renderings show a unique Dalek variant which is a radical departure from the recognised design. Possible reasons for this include lack of access to source material, the Japanese publishers having no rights to the use of the Dalek image and the artist simply being allowed the free rein of his imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.netspeed.com.au/reguli/DALEKMIT.htm |title=The Daleks: Mitsubishi Daleks |last=White |first=Nikki |date=1989 |website=The Ensovaari Embassy |access-date=7 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine Daleks===
Marine Daleks, introduced in the novel ''[[War of the Daleks]]'' (1997), are [[torpedo]]-shaped with their eye at the front and have a gun stick and grappling arm parallel to their body. They are stated to be larger than standard Daleks.&lt;ref name="War of the Daleks" /&gt;

===Marsh Daleks===
[[Image:Marsh Dalek.jpg|thumb|alt=A truncated cone, bisected by a flange one quarter way up its length, topped by a dome and standing on two jointed leg struts which emerge from a flat base. On the front of the cone are two parallel vertical slots, between which a gun stick is mounted below a single hemisphere. A standard Dalek eye protrudes from the dome.|A Marsh Dalek from ''The Dalek Book''.]]

The 1964 ''The Dalek Book'' story ''The Monsters of Gurnian'', written by Terry Nation and David Whittaker, features bipedal Marsh Daleks which are used to keep in check the Horrorkons; two headed [[plesiosaur]]-like creatures which inhabit the swamps of the planet Gurnian.&lt;ref name="The Dalek Book p73 &amp; 74" &gt;{{cite book |last1=Whitaker |first1=David |authorlink1=David Whitaker (screenwriter) |last2=Nation |first2=Terry |authorlink2=Terry Nation |date=1964 |title=[[Dalek comic strips, illustrated annuals and graphic novels#The Dalek Book|''The Dalek Book'']] |location=London |publisher=[[Panther Books]] / Souvenir Press Ltd |pages=73–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As none of the stories or artwork in the book are individually credited it is unknown which of the contributing artists developed the Marsh Dalek design. Marsh Daleks are also referenced briefly in [[Marc Platt (writer)|Marc Platt's]] ''Doctor Who'' novel ''[[Lungbarrow]]'' (1997), in which it is said that during the 26th century humans fought and disabled them by shooting at their legs with high-impulse [[carbine]]s.&lt;ref name="Lungbarrow" &gt;{{cite book |last=Platt |first=Marc |authorlink=Marc Platt (writer) |date=1997 |title=[[Lungbarrow]] |series=[[Virgin New Adventures]] |number=60 |location=London |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |isbn=0-426-20502-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predator Dalek===
The Predator Dalek features in the Doctor Who novel ''[[Engines of War (Doctor Who)|Engines of War]]'' (2014), written by [[George Mann (writer)|George Mann]]. It is stated to be a prototype created to make a perfect Dalek during [[Time War (Doctor Who)|The Last Great Time War]]. This is to be accomplished by capturing the [[War Doctor]], removing his memory and emotions to leave only his creativity, and then integrating him with its technology. It is described as being of the standard [[#"New Series" Daleks|"New Series" Dalek]] design but twice as large, with a deep, metallic vermillion skirt and black hemispheres. The plan is foiled when the Predator Dalek is destroyed, together with the Dalek fleet, by the War Doctor and the Time Lord [[List of Doctor Who villains#Borusa|Borusa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mann |first1=George |authorlink1=George Mann (writer) |date=2014 |title= Doctor Who: Engines of War |location=London |publisher=[[BBC Books]] |page=291 |isbn=978-1-84990-848-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psyche Daleks===
Appearing briefly in the comic strip ''[[Emperor of the Daleks]]'' (1993), written by [[John Freeman (editor)|John Freeman]] and [[Paul Cornell]], Psyche Daleks are depicted with a large mass of green brain tissue contained within a transparent sphere that sits on top of the shoulder section in place of the normal neck bin and dome. In the story a Psyche Dalek is used to control a small group of partially robotised prisoners through a remote device mounted on its arm in place of a plunger. The comic strip was drawn by [[Lee Sullivan (comics)|Lee Sullivan]].&lt;ref name="Emperor of the Daleks" &gt;{{cite comic |writer=[[Paul Cornell|Cornell, Paul]] |artist=[[Lee Sullivan (comics)|Sullivan, Lee]] |colorist=Marina Graham |letterer=[[Annie Parkhouse|Annie Halfacree]] |editor=[[John Freeman (editor)|Freeman, John]] |story=[[Emperor of the Daleks]] |title=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=197–202 |date=1993 |publisher=[[Marvel UK]] |location=London |id=ISSN 0957-9818 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scout Daleks===
In Ben Aaronovitch's novelisation of ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks#In print|Remembrance of the Daleks]]'' (1990) the Imperial Dalek faction use Scout Daleks which are described as being more powerful and streamlined than standard Daleks.&lt;ref name=" Remembrance of the Daleks Novel" /&gt;

===Spider Daleks===
Spider Daleks were a variant proposed by [[John Leekley]] for an aborted ''Doctor Who'' television movie to be produced by [[Amblin Entertainment]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Segal |first1=Philip |authorlink1=Philip Segal |last2=Russell |first2=Gary |authorlink2=Gary Russell |date=2000 |title=Doctor Who: Regeneration |location=London |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |isbn=0-00-710591-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spider Daleks directly based on the Amblin production concept sketches were eventually used in the comic strip [[Dalek comic strips, illustrated annuals and graphic novels#Fire and Brimstone|''Fire and Brimstone'']] (1997) in which they are presented as a radically different form of Dalek from a [[Multiverse|parallel universe]]. The strip was drawn by [[Martin Geraghty]] and [[Robin Smith (comics)|Robin Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic |writer=[[Alan Barnes (writer)|Barnes, Alan]] |penciller=[[Martin Geraghty|Geraghty, Martin]] |inker=[[Robin Smith (comics)|Smith, Robin]] |letterer=Elitta Fell |editor=Gillatt, Gary |story=[[Dalek comic strips, illustrated annuals and graphic novels#Fire and Brimstone|''Fire and Brimstone'']] |title=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=251–255 |date=1997 |publisher=[[Marvel UK]] |location=London |id=ISSN 0957-9818 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In John Peel's novel ''[[War of the Daleks]]'' (1997) they are depicted as creations of Davros and described as being slightly larger than a standard Dalek, with eight legs emerging from the lower half. They are said to have greater manoeuvrability than standard Daleks, at the cost of being more vulnerable at their joints.&lt;ref name="War of the Daleks" /&gt;

===Strider Daleks===
Giant versions of the Spider Dalek, known as Striders, are mentioned in John Peel's novel ''[[War of the Daleks]]'' (1997). They are said to be ten times larger than a standard Spider Dalek and equipped with additional weapons.&lt;ref name="War of the Daleks" /&gt;

===The Klade===
The Klade are a people from the distant future in [[Lance Parkin]]'s BBC [[Eighth Doctor]] novel ''[[Father Time (Doctor Who)|Father Time]]'' (2001) and the [[Miranda (Doctor Who)|Miranda]] spin-off comics (2003). Although physically humanoid they share many cultural characteristics with the Daleks and appear to regard Dalek history as their own. Their name is both an anagram of "Dalek", as "Dalek" is itself of "[[History of the Daleks#Origins|Kaled]]" and a play on the biological term "[[clade]]", being a group of species sharing a common ancestor. They are "...the super-evolved descendants of the Daleks",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Parkin |first1=Lance |authorlink1=Lance Parkin |last2=Pearson |first2=Lars |authorlink2=Lars Pearson |date=2007 |title=AHistory: An Unauthorized History of the Doctor Who Universe |edition=2nd |location=Des Moines |publisher=[[Mad Norwegian Press]] |page=372 |isbn=978-0-975944-66-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the implication being that, like the [[Thals]], their mutation has come "full circle" and returned them to a humanoid form.

===Skaro Degradations===
The Skaro Degradations are first mentioned in the Doctor Who television serial ''[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]'' (2009), where the [[Tenth Doctor]] says they were one of the horrors of [[Time War (Doctor Who)|The Last Great Time War]]. They later appear in the [[War Doctor]] novel ''[[Engines of War (Doctor Who)|Engines of War]]'' (2014) by George Mann, described as being unstable and unpredictable abominations created by Dalek experiments to retro-evolve their own genome. Three types are mentioned in the book. Glider Degradations travel by hovering above the ground. The Dalek mutant is housed in a clear, reinforced compartment set beneath a standard Dalek dome and resembles a limbless, humanoid torso. Mechanical arms and energy weapons are located on both sides of the casing. Spider Degradations are egg-shaped with red and black hemispheres, move on three legs and are armed with four energy weapons. Temporal Weapon Degradations are similar to [[#Special Weapons Dalek|Special Weapons Daleks]] and equipped with a temporal cannon capable of erasing its victims from history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mann |first1=George |authorlink1=George Mann (writer) |date=2014 |title= Doctor Who: Engines of War |location=London |publisher=[[BBC Books]] |isbn=978-1-84990-848-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternate timeline Daleks===
Daleks from an [[alternate timeline]] appear in the [[E-book]] ''The Ripple Effect'' (2013) by [[Malorie Blackman]]. The alternate Daleks are portrayed as a civilised, philosophical, peace-loving race, speaking with quiet, modulated voices and having individual names. Most of the alternate Daleks have two manipulator arms and no weapon, with only those defending Skaro from space being armed. Ultimately the Doctor discovers that the alternate timeline is unstable, causing the Universe to decay. Travelling back in time he restores the original timeline, erasing the alternate Daleks from existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blackman |first1=Malorie |authorlink1=Malorie Blackman |date=2013 |title= The Ripple Effect |series=Doctor Who 50th Anniversary ebooks |number=7 |location=London |publisher=[[Puffin]] |asin= B00B5N35JY }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stained Glass Daleks===
[[Stained Glass]] Daleks feature in the [[Big Finish Productions]] Doctor Who audio drama ''Order of the Daleks'' (2016).&lt;ref name="Order of the Daleks" &gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Mike Tucker]] (writer), [[Jamie Anderson (producer)|Jamie Anderson]] (director), David Richardson (producer) |date=November 2016 |id=218 |title=''Order of the Daleks'' |medium=CD |location= Berkshire |publisher=[[Big Finish Productions]] |isbn=978-1-78178-897-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are depicted as having ornate, stained glass casings and are harboured by monks of the Brotherhood of the Black Petal on the technologically undeveloped planet Strellin. The Stained Glass Dalek concept was created by [[Mike Tucker]], with the cover artwork for the audio production being designed and rendered by Chris Thompson.&lt;ref name="Designing the Stained Glass Dalek" &gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jamieanderson.me.uk/designing-stained-glass-dalek/ |title=Designing the Stained Glass Dalek |date=August 2016 |website=Jamie Anderson |publisher=[[Jamie Anderson (producer)|Jamie Anderson]] |access-date=6 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Paradigm Dalek Emperor===
Appearing at the climax of "City of the Daleks" (2010), the first instalment of the video game [[Doctor Who: The Adventure Games]], the New Paradigm Dalek Emperor is almost identical to the [[#Emperor Dalek|New Series Emperor Dalek]] seen in the 2005 episode [[The Parting of the Ways]]. Notable differences are the dome and eye assembly, which are of the [[#New Paradigm Daleks|New Paradigm]] design, and a blue colour scheme.&lt;ref name="City of the Daleks" &gt;{{cite video game |title=[[Doctor Who: The Adventure Games#City of the Daleks|City of the Daleks]] |developer=[[Sumo Digital]] |publisher=BBC Wales Interactive |date=5 June 2010 |platform=[[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS]] |version=1.0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Eternity Clock Dalek Emperor===
Featured in the video game [[Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock]] (2012), this version of the Dalek Emperor first appears as a large, levitating, purple sphere, studded with silver hemispheres. This is shown to be a shell which can expand and split into sixteen vertical segments, positionable to form a defensive barrier. The internal structure is mainly of the [[#New Paradigm Daleks|New Paradigm]] design, consisting of a large dome incorporating a foreshortened eye stalk and thin, extended dome lights, supported by an inverted neck bin. Below this a conical metallic structure tapers downward towards a circular, rotating weapons platform to which it is connected by an energy field. Arranged evenly around the edge of the platform are three [[#"New Series" Daleks'|"New Series" Dalek]] style gun sticks.&lt;ref name="The Eternity Clock" &gt;{{cite video game |title=[[Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock]] |developer=[[Supermassive Games]] |publisher=[[BBC Worldwide]] |date= 2012 |platform=[[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation Vita]] |version=1.0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other notable Dalek designs==

===The Dark Dimension Dalek===
"[[List of unmade Doctor Who serials and films#Lost in the Dark Dimension|Lost in the Dark Dimension]]" was the working title of a feature-length BBC ''Doctor Who'' episode, planned to celebrate the programme's thirtieth anniversary.&lt;ref name="Lost in The Dark Dimension Article" &gt;{{cite journal |last=Norton |first=Charles |date=21 January 2010 |title=Doctor Who: Lost in The Dark Dimension |journal=[[SciFiNow]] Magazine |issue=37 |pages=34–37 |location=Bournemouth |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |issn=1477-6650 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Fitzgerald at [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]] was engaged to redesign the [[#Special Weapons Dalek|Special Weapons Dalek]] for the production.&lt;ref name="Dark Dimension Article"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nzdwfc.tetrap.com/archive/tsv44/darkdimension.html |title=TSV 44: Inside the Dark Dimension |last=Preddle |first=Jon |date=1995 |website=archive.is - nzdwfc.tetrap.com |access-date=12 December 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.fo/20120713220042/http://nzdwfc.tetrap.com/archive/tsv44/darkdimension.html |archivedate=13 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A sketch of the proposed variant was produced at the time by BBC artist Alan Marshall. Notable differences from a standard Dalek include a substantially enlarged fender, an enhanced midsection featuring two large shoulder-mounted cannon and a foreshortened neck bin encircled by three thick neck rings. Programme development commenced in June 1992 and was officially cancelled in July 1993, with the BBC citing financial and logistical reasons.&lt;ref name="Illuminating the Dark Dimension" &gt;{{cite journal |last=Bignell |first=Richard |date=16 January 2012 |title=Illuminating the Dark Dimension |journal=Nothing at the End of the Lane |issue=3 |page=112 |location=Chatham |publisher=Nothing at the End of the Lane }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a Dark Dimension Dalek prop was never constructed by the BBC it has become the subject of a number of illustrations and a full size version built by a fan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projectdalek.co.uk/storm/ |title=Dalek STORM The Dark Dimensions Special Weapons Dalek |last=Clark |first=Alan |date=2009 |website=Dalek Storm |accessdate=20 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tom Thomson headstone.jpg|thumb|Tom Thomson's headstone in [[Meaford, Ontario]]. Thomson's part of the stone bears the inscription: ''Tom Thomson Landscape painter Drowned in Canoe Lake July 8 1917 aged 39 years 11 months 3 days''.]]

The '''death of Tom Thomson''', the Canadian painter, occurred on 8 July 1917, on [[Canoe Lake (Nipissing District)|Canoe Lake]] in [[Algonquin Provincial Park]] in [[Nipissing District, Ontario|Nipissing District]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. After Thomson drowned in the water, his upturned canoe was discovered later that afternoon and his body eight days later. Many theories regarding Thomson's death—including that he was murdered or committed suicide—have become popular in the years since his death, though these ideas lack any substantiation.

Thomson stands tall as a figure in [[Canadian art]]. His later work has had a profound influence on both the artists contemporary to him as well as those coming much later. Paintings such as ''[[The Jack Pine]]'' and ''[[The West Wind (painting)|The West Wind]]'' have taken a prominent place in the [[culture of Canada]] and are some of the country's most iconic pieces of art. In addition to his prominence as an artist, he has developed a reputation as an ideal Canadian [[Outdoor enthusiast|outdoorsman]], proficient in [[canoe]]ing and fishing, though his talents in the former have come to be doubted.

Though he is most known for his painting, [[Tom Thomson]] is often mythologized as a veritable [[Outdoor enthusiast|outdoorsman]].{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=236}} He was taken out of school at an early age, possibly due to a lung condition.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=41}}{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=113}}{{sfnb|MacDonald|1917|p=47}} This afforded him time to explore wooded areas and develop a deep appreciation for nature.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=4}} He spent much of his time on walks with his grandmother's first cousin, Dr. William Brodie, a well known [[Entomology|entomologist]], [[Ornithology|ornithologist]] and [[Botany|botanist]].{{sfnb|Murray|1999|pp=6–7}}{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=93}} He similarly developed a love for both fishing and hunting,{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|pp=28–29}}{{sfnb|Murray|2015|loc="Prologue"}} though he eventually gave up hunting after shooting a deer "as the look in its eyes was too human."{{sfnb|Murray|2015|loc="Prologue"}}{{sfnb|Henry|1931}}

Dr. [[James MacCallum]] contributed stories to Thomson's image as an outdoorsman, including one story that Thomson encountered a large wolf who, after sniffing him briefly, left him alone.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=236}} He further wrote, {{quote|[Thomson] was wont to paddle out into the centre of the lake on which he happened to be camping and spend the whole night there in order to get away from the flies and mosquitos {{sic}}. Motionless he studied the night skies and the changing outline of the shores while beaver and otter played around his canoe.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=236}}{{sfnb|MacCallum|1918|p=382}}}}

Thomson has often been remembered as an expert [[wiktionary:canoeist|canoeist]]. David Silcox has argued that this image is likely romanticized.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=237}} [[A. Y. Jackson]] wrote that Thomson "paddled like an [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]]," holding his abilities in high esteem.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=237}} Despite this, Park ranger Mark Robinson said that Thomson admitted to him in 1913 that he did not know much about canoeing.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=237}} In addition, there are multiple stories of him capsizing.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=15}}{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|pp=215, 237}}{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|pp=94–95}} In 1912, after hearing that Thomson had capsized and lost most of his supplies on a canoeing trip up the Mississagi River, friend John McRuer replied saying, "You might have been drowned you devil; and that was not the first time you were bumped, eh!"{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=237}}

Despite these romantic images, an area that Thomson was no doubt proficient in was fishing. The deep love of fishing he developed while young remained for his entire life, so much so that his reputation through Algonquin Park was equally divided between art and [[angling]].{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|pp=28, 28n39}} While most who visited the Park were led by hired guides, Thomson moved through on his own. Indeed, many of his fishing locations appear in his work.{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=29}} Upon visiting Canoe Lake for the first time in 1914, A. Y. Jackson wrote to [[J. E. H. MacDonald]], "It appears that Tom Thomson is some fisherman, quite noted round here."{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=28}}{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=123}}{{sfnb|Jackson|1914}}

From 1914 onward, Thomson regularly traveled to [[Algonquin Provincial Park|Algonquin Park]] in the spring, either camping on [[Canoe Lake (Nipissing District)|Canoe Lake]] or staying at the Mowat Lodge hotel. He spent his time there sketching and working as a fishing guide, returning to [[Toronto]] in the fall, producing larger canvas works from his original sketches.{{sfnb|Murray|2015|loc="From the Studio Building to Algonquin Park and Home Again"}} In 1917 Thomson returned to Canoe Lake at the beginning of April, arriving early enough to paint the remaining snow and the ice breaking up on the surrounding lakes.{{sfnb|Murray|2015|loc="From the Studio Building to Algonquin Park and Home Again"}}{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=141}} The paintings became his own visual diary of the day,{{sfnb|Murray|2015|loc="From the Studio Building to Algonquin Park and Home Again"}}{{sfnb|Robinson|1930|p=3}} morphing into a [[Serial imagery|series]] that he described as, "a record of the weather for 62 days, rain or shine, or snow, dark or bright."{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=116}} He wrote home to his father saying that, though he had not sold many sketches that year, that he thought he could "get along for another year at least while I stick to painting as long as I can."{{sfnb|Murray|2002a|pp=303–04}} In his final letter to MacCallum—sent only one day before his disappearance—he complained of flies and [[mosquito]]es. He had not done much sketching since they emerged but was hopeful the warmer weather would soon kill them off. He promised to send along some of his winter sketches and was looking forward to sketching on several trips planned for the next two months.{{sfnb|Thomson|1917b}}{{efn|group=note|Mowat P. O., July 7, 1917&lt;br&gt;Dear Sir:&lt;br&gt;I am still around Frasers and have not done any sketching since the flies started. The weather has been wet and cold all spring and the flies and mosquitos much worse than I have seen them any year and the [[Insect repellent|fly dope]] doesnt {{sic}} have any effect on them. This however is the second warm day we have had this year and another day or so like this will finish them. Will send my winter sketches down in a day or two and have every intention of making some more but it has been almost impossible lately. Have done a great deal of paddling this spring and the fishing has been fine. Have done some guiding for fishing parties and will have some other trips this month and next with probably sketching in between. [...]&lt;br&gt;Hoping you are well, I am&lt;br&gt;Yours truly / Tom Thomson{{sfnb|Thomson|1917b}}{{sfnb|Murray|2002a|p=306}}}}

The works he completed over this spring display the masterful control of colour he had come to develop—especially apparent in a painting like ''The Rapids''{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=17}}—and are painted with a particular "crispness and freshness."{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=141}} His sketches in particular show how he matured into "a subtlety of expression, using a brisk but delicate handling."{{sfnb|Murray|2015|loc="From the Studio Building to Algonquin Park and Home Again"}} The bold and expressive brushstrokes that he is now famous for are evident in paintings like ''Path Behind Mowat Lodge'' and ''Tea Lake Dam''.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|pp=17–18}} Also on display in the former are small areas of bare wood panel, visible through the paint. This device further adds to the lighting of the scene.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|pp=74–75}} The aggressive style of painting Thomson utilized was seen consistently in the [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] movement that followed his death.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=73}} His final works have been described by [[art history|art historians]] David Silcox and [[Harold Town]] as moving in the direction of [[abstract art|abstraction]].{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|pp=17–18, 44, 52, 57, 62, 68, 73}}{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=148}}{{efn|group=note|For more regarding Thomson's later abstract tendencies, refer to: {{bulleted list|{{harvp|Silcox|2015|p=44}}|{{harvp|Silcox|Town|2017|pp=148–49}}|{{section link|Artistic development of Tom Thomson#Approaching abstraction}}
}}}} This is especially evident in what is perhaps his final work, ''After the Storm'', which, "When viewed up close, Thomson’s thick, broad application of paint in this landscape melts into pure abstraction."{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=52}} The landscapes of his final works in late spring and early summer often contain these types of bold, generalized forms.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=142}}

Besides the deep love he had come to develop for Algonquin Park, Thomson was beginning to show an eagerness to depict areas beyond the park and explore other northern subjects.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=18}} In a May 1917 letter to his brother-in-law, he wrote:

{{quote|I may possibly go out on the [[Canadian Northern Railway|Canadian Northern [Railway]]] this summer to paint the [[Canadian Rockies|Rockys]] {{sic}} but have not made all the arrangements yet. If I go it will be in July &amp; August.{{sfnb|Thomson|1917a}}{{sfnb|Murray|2002a|pp=304–05}}}}

A. Y. Jackson suggested Thomson would have traveled even further north, just as the other members of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] eventually did.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=122}}

==Death==
On the morning of 8 July 1917, Thomson was seen walking to Joe Lake Dam with Shannon Fraser, the owner of the Mowat Lodge.{{sfnb|Murray|2002b|p=317}} He often spent his night there when the park proved too cold for camping.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=18}} Mark Robinson, a [[park ranger]], noted in his diary that Thomson "left Fraser's Dock after 12:30 pm to go to Tea Lake Dam or West Lake."{{sfnb|Murray|2002b|p=317}} Thomson disappeared during this canoeing trip on Canoe Lake.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=49}}{{efn|group=note|On 10 July, Fraser sent a telegram to MacCallum, writing:

The body was examined by Dr. Goldwin Howland who concluded that the official cause of death was drowning.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=49}}{{sfnb|Howland|1917}}{{efn|group=note|Howland later recounted the following: {{quote|I saw body of man floating in Canoe Lake Monday, July 16th, at about 10 A. M. and notified Mr. George Rowe a resident who removed body to shore. On 17th Tuesday, I examined [the body] and found it to be that of a man aged about 40 years in advanced stage of decomposition, face abdomen and limbs swollen, blisters on limbs, was a bruise on right temple size of 4" long, no other sign of external marks visible on body, air issuing from mouth, some bleeding from right ear, cause of death drowning.{{sfnb|Howland|1917}}}}}} The coroner, Dr. Arthur E. Ranney, supported Howland's conclusion that the drowning was accidental, further writing that "the evidence from the other six witnesses points that the cause of death was drowning."{{sfnb|Ranney|1931}} Regarding the four inch bruise on Thomson's temple, he wrote that, "no doubt, [it] was caused by stricking {{sic}} some [obstacle], like a stone, when the body was drowned."{{sfnb|Ranney|1931}}

The day after the body was discovered, it was interred in Mowat Cemetery near Canoe Lake.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=49}}{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=142}}{{sfnb|Robinson|1917}}{{efn|group=note|Mowat Cemetery was located at {{coord|45|33|47|N|78|43|42|W}}.}} Under the direction of Thomson's older brother George, the body was exhumed two days later and was shipped to [[Owen Sound]].

==Legacy==
{{Quote box|width=30em|align=left|quote="Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in [[Canoe Lake (Nipissing District)|Canoe Lake]]. Tom Thomson still stands as ''the'' Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind."|source=—[[David Milne (artist)|David Milne]] in a letter to [[National Gallery of Canada#Directors|H. O. McCurry]], 1930{{sfnb|Milne|1930}}{{sfnb|Dejardin|2018|pp=17, 194}}}}
Since his death, Thomson's work has grown in value and popularity. Scholar Sherrill Grace has written that Thomson is a "haunting presence" for Canadian artists and that he "embodies the Canadian artistic identity."{{sfnb|Grace|2004|p=96}} Group of Seven member [[Arthur Lismer]] similarly wrote that "Tom Thomson is the manifestation of the Canadian character."{{sfnb|Lismer|1934|pp=163–64}}

In 2002, the National Gallery of Canada staged a major exhibition of his work, giving Thomson the same level of prominence afforded [[Picasso]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], and the Group of Seven in previous years.{{sfnb|Reid|2002a}} As of 2009, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was ''Early Spring, Canoe Lake'' (1917) which sold in 2009 for $2,749,500 ({{Inflation|CA|2749500|2009|fmt=eq|r=-3|cursign=[[Canadian Dollar|CAD$]]}}). Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=66}} One example of the demand Thomson's work has achieved is the previously lost ''Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park'' (1912/13). The painting was discovered in an [[Edmonton]] basement in 2018 and went on to sell for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction.{{sfnb|Vikander|2018}}{{sfnb|The Canadian Press|2018}} The increased value of Thomson's work has led to the discovery of numerous [[art forgery|forgeries]] of his work on the market.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=182}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=74}}{{sfnb|Dellandrea|2017}}

[[File:TomThomsonGallery.JPG|thumb|The Tom Thomson Art Gallery in [[Owen Sound]] has a large collection of Thomson artworks, especially from his earlier career.]]

In the summer of 2004 another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location nearer the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which Thomson is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of Thomson's work leaving pennies or small art supplies behind as tribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heritagemeaford.com/heritage-church.php?mid=1|title=Leith United Church {{!}} Heritage Meaford|website=www.heritagemeaford.com|access-date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tom Thomson Art Gallery|url=https://www.tomthomson.org/|publisher=City of Owen Sound}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 Thomson's shack from behind the [[Studio Building (Toronto)|Studio Building]] was moved to the [[McMichael Canadian Art Collection]] in [[Kleinburg]].{{sfnb|Dexter|1968}} Numerous examples of his work are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. Thomson's influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including [[Emily Carr]], Goodridge Roberts, Harold Town, and [[Joyce Wieland]].{{sfnb|Stanners|2017}}

===An "untainted" artist===
In the years since his death, Thomson has often been described as being independent of previous artistic traditions.{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=29–30, 212}}{{sfnb|Roza|1997|pp=29–30}}{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=85}} Many have pointed to the fact that he never visited Europe or museums in the [[United States]] as evidence that he managed to avoid the developments of [[Modern art|Modernist]] experiment.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=85}} Thomson's lack of formal art education similarly caused the other members of the group to later see him as a natural, untainted artist, and this view has entered the myth and public perception surrounding him.{{sfnb|Roza|1997|pp=29–30}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=29–30}}

David Silcox and Andrew Hunter have argued that these perceptions were primarily propagated by his friends, those who formed the Group of Seven in the years following his death and others in the Canadian art scene,{{efn|group=note|Hunter has pointed to F. B. Housser, Newton McTavish, Albert H. Robson, [[Barker Fairley]], [[Harold Mortimer-Lamb]] and Dr. [[James MacCallum]] as being major influences in propagating the Thomson legends.{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=35}}}} nearly all of whom relied on the same basic details in their treatments of Thomson's life and career.{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=35}} Lismer, for example, wrote, "[Thomson] had no connection with styles or schools... He had nothing to do with Europe and in his art there is not a trace of inherited style or influence from abroad... If one  knew Thomson, one also realized that he knew nothing of such as things as &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Art Nouveau]] or [[Impressionism]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;."{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=85}} Jackson similarly wrote that Thomson's "rugged individuality was never dominated by any outside influence,"{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=85}} and that Thomson was the "Instigator of the movement to the North Country."{{sfnb|Jackson|1935}} [[Lawren Harris]] echoed these views, saying "There was nothing that interfered with Tom's direct, primal vision of nature. He was completely innocent of any of the machinery of civilization and was happiest when away from it in the north."{{sfnb|McInnes|1944}} Barker Fairley wrote that, "Neither theory nor any acquired opinion can have had any permanent place in Thomson's mind. He was naïve throughout."{{sfnb|Fairley|1920|p=246}} Harold Mortimer-Lamb wrote, "With his equipment he went to Nature and communed with her in all her moods."{{sfnb|Mortimer-Lamb|1919|p=124}} Blodwen Davies wrote, "Through the story of painting in Canada there stalks a tall, lean trailsman, with his sketch box and paddle, an artist and dreamer who made the wilderness his cloister and there worshipped Nature in her secret moods."{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=36}}{{sfnb|Davies|1930}} F. B. Housser wrote, "Never before had such knowledge and the feeling for such things been given to expression in paint. Thomson's canvases are unique in the annals of all art especially when it is remembered that he was untrained as a painter. His master was nature."{{sfnb|Housser|1926}} In general, members of the Group claimed that their art did not originate in established artistic traditions but was instead dictated by the landscape itself.{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=29–30, 212}}{{efn|group=note|For example, see: {{bulleted list|{{harvp|Harris|1929|p=185}}|{{harvp|Jackson|1958|p=22}}}}}} A. Y. Jackson described Thomson as "the guide, the interpreter" who introduced his friends to "a new world, the north country."{{sfnb|Roza|1997|loc=p. 30n29}}{{sfnb|Reid|1971|p=90}} Dennis Reid argued similarly, writing that Thomson's death was seen "almost as a sacrifice to the idea of an indigenous Canadian art... Thomson was... to become Canada's first Old Master, and as an idea he has acted as a constant inspiration to all who believed that the secret of Canada's self-knowledge is somehow contained in the land."{{sfnb|Roza|1997|loc=p. 30n29}}{{sfnb|Reid|1971|p=90}} [[Historical revisionism|Revisionist art historians]] have criticized the view that Thomson and the Group of Seven were originators of a new [[Canadian nationalism|Canadian nationalist]] style of art.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=58}}{{efn|group=note|For example, see: {{bulleted list|{{harvp|Dawn|2007}}|{{harvp|Jessup|2007}}|{{harvp|McKay|2011|loc=Ch. 8–9}}
}}}}

Despite the popular notion that Thomson had no formal art instruction, it is possible that he briefly studied under [[Art of the United Kingdom|British artist]] [[William Cruikshank (painter)|William Cruikshank]] around 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{plainlist|
* {{harvp|Murray|1986|p=6}}

* {{harvp|Silcox|Town|2017|p=43}}
* {{harvp|Stacey|2002|p=52}}
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two sources corroborate this however. The first is a single undated note from Cruikshank to professor [[James Mavor]], arranging to bring a "Tomson" {{sic}} to meet him.{{sfnb|Cruikshank}}{{sfnb|Reid|2002b|loc=p. 70n21}} Further complicating the matter is that the original class list no longer survives.{{sfnb|Reid|2002b|loc=p. 70n21}} The second is a letter from H. B. Jackson to Blodwen Davies, writing, "Tom studied from life &amp; the antique in art school. If I remember right Cruikshank was the instructor."{{sfnb|Jackson|1931}}{{sfnb|Hill|2002|loc=p. 113n18}} Besides in-person instruction, it is also possible that he read [[John Ruskin]]'s 1857 handbook, ''[[The Elements of Drawing]]'', while learning to draw.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=2}} Outside of these possibilities, it seems that he had no other art instruction.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=9}} Thomson's work in commercial art however did seem to have an influence on his painting, leading him to familiarity with the Art Nouveau as well as Arts and Crafts movements.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=113}}{{sfnb|Reid|2002b|pp=65–83}} Similarly, working with his fellow artists caused him to become aware of the techniques of [[Impressionism]] and [[Post-Impressionism]].{{sfnb|Roza|1997|p=30n29}}{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=88}} Regarding Art Nouveau tendencies, Jackson wrote that, "We (the Group of Seven and Tom Thomson) treated our subjects with the freedom of designers. We tried to emphasize colour, line and pattern."{{sfnb|McKay|2011|p=185}} These techniques can be seen within Thomson's work, whether it be Impressionism in ''The Pointers'' (1916–17); Art Nouveau in ''[[Northern River (painting)|Northern River]]'' (1914–15), ''[[:File:Tom Thomson Decorative Landscape, Birches.jpg|Decorative Landscape, Birches]]'' (1915–16), ''[[Spring Ice]]'' (1915–16) and ''The West Wind'' (1916–17); or [[Expressionism]] in ''After the Storm'' (1917) and ''Cranberry Marsh'' (1916).{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=68, 71}}

Smith]] wrote in a letter to [[Sandra Djwa]] that it was Thomson's painting ''The Jack Pine'' that helped him get started on his poem, "The Lonely Land."{{sfnb|Roza|1997|p=74}}{{sfnb|Djwa|1992|p=208}} The poem, perhaps Smith's most known and most anthologized, was first published in ''[[Montreal Group#McGill Fortnightly Review|The McGill Fortnightly Review]]'' on 9 January 1926, subtitled "Group of Seven."{{sfnb|Roza|1997|p=74}}{{sfnb|Smith|2006|loc=p. 53n1}} It underwent several revisions, appearing in ''[[Canadian Forum]]'' in July 1927 and the American magazine ''[[The Dial]]'' in June 1929.{{sfnb|Roza|1997|pp=75–76}} Smith had not seen the painting in person, but only as a colour reproduction.{{sfnb|Roza|1997|p=74}}{{sfnb|Djwa|1992|p=208}} The first stanza utilizes the texture ("jagged," "smooth") and rhythmic movement ("sharp," "bitter," "barbs") of a painting as it describes a northern landscape.{{sfnb|Roza|1997|pp=74–75}} Smith's 1925 poem "Prayer" proceeds similarly, even referencing a jack pine in one of the early stanzas.{{sfnb|Roza|1997|pp=67–68}} Several other books of poetry inspired by Thomson have also been published, including George Whipple's ''Tom Thomson and Other Poems'' (2000),{{sfnb|Whipple|2000}} Troy Jollimore's ''Tom Thomson in Purgatory'' (2006),{{sfnb|Jollimore|2006}} and Kevin Irie's ''Viewing Tom Thomson: A Minority Report'' (2012).{{sfnb|Irie|2012}}

[[Joyce Wieland]]'s 1976 film ''The Far Shore'' is based on the life and death of Tom Thomson.{{sfnb|Wieland|1976}} Journalist Roy MacGregor's 1980 novel ''Shorelines''—later reissued in 2002 as ''Canoe Lake''—is a fictional interpretation of Thomson's death.{{sfnb|MacGregor|1980}} Neil Lehto's 2005 book ''Algonquin Elegy'' is a self-described piece of [[historical fiction]], focusing on Thomson's death.{{sfnb|Lehto|2005}} Several songs reference Thomson's death, including [[The Tragically Hip]]'s 1991 single "[[Three Pistols]]."{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=65}}

In 2018, a section of [[Ontario Highway 60]]—the primary corridor through Algonquin Park—was renamed "Tom Thomson Parkway."{{sfnb|Cilliers|2018}} [[Canada Post]] has issued multiple stamps of Thomson's work from as early as 1967. Works depicted have included ''The Jack Pine'' (printed in 1967), ''April in Algonquin Park'' (1977), ''Autumn Birches'' (1977), ''The West Wind'' (1990) and ''In the Northland'' (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Search Canadian Stamps - Canada - Tom Thomson |url=https://www.canadianpostagestamps.ca/canada/search?title=Tom%20Thomson |website=www.canadianpostagestamps.ca |publisher=Canadian Stamps |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternate theories==
{{See also|The Tom Thomson Mystery}}
Many alternate theories have swirled around the nature of Tom Thomson's death, including that he was murdered or committed suicide. Though these ideas lack substantiation, they have continued to persist in the popular culture.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=49}}{{sfnb|Klages|2016|pp=274–97}} Andrew Hunter has pointed to Robinson as being largely responsible for the suggestion that there was more to Thomson's death than accidental drowning. Hunter expanded on this thought, writing, "...I am convinced that people's desire to believe the Thomson murder mystery/soap opera is rooted in the firmly fixed idea that he was an expert woodsman, intimate with nature. Such figures aren't supposed to die by "accident." If they do, it is like [[Grey Owl]]'s being exposed as an Englishman."{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=39}}

In 1935, Blodwen Davies published the first exploration of Thomson's death outside of newspaper accounts from the time of Thomson's death.{{sfnb|Davies|1935|pp=122–25}} A self-published edition of 500 copies, her doubts about the official decision of cause of death sold poorly.{{sfnb|Davies|1935}} In 1970, Judge William Little's book, ''[[The Tom Thomson Mystery]]'', recounted how in 1956 Little and three friends dug up Thomson's original gravesite in Mowat Cemetery on Canoe Lake.{{sfnb|Little|1970|pp=110–127}} They believed that the remains they found were Thomson's. In the fall of 1956, medical investigators determined that the body was that of an unidentified Aboriginal.{{sfnb|Sharpe|1956}} Canadian newspaper columnist Roy MacGregor has described his 2009 examination of records of the 1956 remains unearthed by William Little (the remains have been reburied or lost) and concluded that the body was actually Thomson's, indicating "that Thomson never left Canoe Lake."{{sfnb|MacGregor|2010}}{{Page needed|date=March 2018}}

===Debunking===
David Silcox and Harold Town have pointed out incorrect evidence being used to justify the belief that Thomson was murdered. Chief among these is that Thomson's feet were found tangled in wire. This claim is a misinterpretation of Robinson's original observation that the body had a carefully bound fishing line around a sprained ankle, actually a common a remedy for [[arthritis]] or a sore joint.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=49}}{{sfnb|Robinson|1917}} Silcox has proposed that it is easy to imagine Thomson standing in his canoe to cast a fishing line, losing his balance in the process, hitting his head on the [[gunwale]] and falling into the water unconscious only to drown.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=49}}

In an essay entitled, "The Many Deaths of Tom Thomson," published in 2011, Gregory Klages describes how testimony and theories regarding Thomson's death have evolved since 1917.{{sfnb|Klages|2016|pp=274–97}} Assessing the secondary accounts against the primary evidence, Klages concludes that Thomson's death is consistent with the official assessment of an accidental drowning. Historians Kathleen Garay and Christl Verduyn state, "Klages' forensic archival sleuthing does provide for the first time some degree of certainty regarding this event."{{sfnb|Verduyn|2011|p=7}} Klages expanded on these ideas in a book with a similar name, ''The Many Deaths of Tom Thomson: Separating Fact from Fiction'', published in 2016. He particularly challenges MacGregor's claims, suggesting MacGregor is guilty of misrepresenting evidence.{{sfnb|Klages|2016}}

==Selection of Thomson's final sketches==
{{see also|Tom Thomson#Artistic peak (1916–17)}}

Thomson produced roughly three dozen sketches in his final spring. His landscapes illustrate several snowy scenes in Algonquin Park and indicate an increasing fascination in [[birch]] trees.

[[File:Lentes Salvador Allende.jpg|thumb|Allende's glasses, found in the Palacio de La Moneda after his death.]]
On September 11, 1973, [[Salvador Allende]], [[President of Chile]], died of self-inflicted gunshot wounds during a [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|coup d'état]] led by the [[Chilean Army]] Commander-in-Chief [[Augusto Pinochet]]. After decades of suspicions that Allende might have been assassinated by the [[Military of Chile|Chilean Armed Forces]], a Chilean court in 2011 authorized the exhumation and autopsy of Allende's remains. A team of international experts examined the remains and concluded that Allende had shot himself with an [[AK-47]] [[assault rifle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lanacion.cl/fueron-exhumados-los-restos-de-salvador-allende/noticias/2011-05-23/085914.html |title=nacion.cl - Restos de Salvador Allende fueron exhumados |publisher=Lanacion.cl |date=2011-05-23 |accessdate=2012-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218154958/http://www.lanacion.cl/fueron-exhumados-los-restos-de-salvador-allende/noticias/2011-05-23/085914.html |archivedate=2014-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, the judge in charge of the investigation affirmed the experts' findings and ruled Allende's death a suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.terra.com.co/internacional/latinoamerica/ministro-cierra-investigacion-sobre-allende-se-suicido,3b5fd07709b84310VgnVCM20000099f154d0RCRD.html |title=Ministro cierra investigación sobre Allende: se suicidó - Terra Colombia |publisher=Noticias.terra.com.co |accessdate=2012-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 11, 2012, the 39th anniversary of Allende's death, a Chilean appeals court unanimously upheld the trial court's ruling, officially closing the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/09/11/world/americas/chile-allende-suicide/index.html |title=Chilean court confirms Allende suicide - CNN.com |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |accessdate=2012-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Isabel Allende Bussi]]—the daughter of Salvador Allende and currently a member of the [[Senate of Chile|Chilean Senate]]—the Allende family has long accepted that the former President shot himself, telling the BBC that: "The report conclusions are consistent with what we already believed. When faced with extreme circumstances, he made the decision of taking his own life, instead of being humiliated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-14210729 |title=BBC News - Chile inquiry confirms President Allende killed himself |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-07-19 |accessdate=2012-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On September 11, 1973, just prior to the capture of the [[Palacio de La Moneda]] (the presidential palace) by military units loyal to Pinochet, President Salvador Allende made his famous [[s:Salvador Allende's Last Speech|farewell speech]] to Chileans on live radio (''Radio Magallanes''). The president spoke of his love for Chile and of his deep faith in its future. He also stated that, as he was committed to Chile, he would not take an easy way out or be used as a propaganda tool by those he called "traitors" (accepting an offer of safe passage, like [[Carlos Altamirano]]). The radio address was made while gunfire and explosions were clearly audible in the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ultimos discursos de allende Archives - piensaChile   ★ piensachile.com|url = http://piensachile.com/tag/ultimos-discursos-de-allende/|website = piensachile.com|accessdate = 2015-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterwards, an official announcement declared that he had gone to war with an [[AK-47]] rifle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidencia.gob.cl/view/viewGaleriaPresidentes.asp?id=31&amp;seccion=Presidencia%20por%20Dentro&amp;interfazseccion=Galeria%20Presidentes#a31 |title=Salvador Allende Gossens |publisher=Presidencia de la República de Chile |accessdate=2006-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040811031934/http://www.presidencia.gob.cl/view/viewGaleriaPresidentes.asp?id=31&amp;seccion=Presidencia%20por%20Dentro&amp;interfazseccion=Galeria%20Presidentes#a31 |archivedate=2004-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Allende's corpse was carried out of Palacio de La Moneda wrapped in a [[Bolivia]]n [[poncho]] by soldiers and fire fighters.&lt;ref&gt;González 2013, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

His body was sent to [[List of hospitals in Chile|Hospital Militar]] arriving about 17:30. Among those present during the autopsy was one of Allende's former classmates in university.&lt;ref&gt;González 2013, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The autopsy also recorded his death as a suicide.&lt;ref name=Gonzalez&gt;Gonzalez Camus, Ignacio, ''El dia en que murio Allende'' ("The day that Allende Died"), 1988, pp. 282 and following.&lt;/ref&gt;

Allende's weapon was purportedly given to him as a gift by [[Fidel Castro]]. It bore a golden plate engraved: "To my good friend Salvador from Fidel, who by different means tries to achieve the same goals".&lt;ref name=Whelan&gt;Whelan, James, ''Out of the Ashes: The Life, Death and Transfiguration of Democracy in Chile'', 1989, pp. 511-512 and 519-520.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official version==
At approximately 1:50 PM local time, President Allende ordered the defenders  of the La Moneda Palace to surrender. The defenders then formed a line from the second floor, down the stairs and onto the Morande street door. The president went along this queue, from the ground floor up the stairs, shaking hands and thanking everyone personally for their support in that difficult moment. At the end of the queue, Allende turned toward the Independence salon, located in the north-east side of the Palace's second floor.

At the same time, Dr. Patricio Guijón (a member of La Moneda's infirmary staff) himself decided to return upstairs to recover his gas-mask as a souvenir. He heard a noise, and opened the door of the Independence salon in time to see the president shoot himself with his [[AK-47]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/02/world/chile-ends-exile-of-allende-family.html CHILE ENDS EXILE OF ALLENDE FAMILY], ''The New York Times'', 2 September 1988. Accessed online 30 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; From the other side of the salon and through an open door, Dr. José Quiroga,&lt;ref&gt;Patricio Zamorano, [http://www.laopinion.com/archivo/index.html?START=1&amp;RESULTSTART=1&amp;DISPLAYTYPE=single&amp;FREETEXT=quiroga&amp;FDATEd12=&amp;FDATEd13=&amp;SORT_MODE=SORT_MODE  Muerte de Allende: los testigos que quedaron fuera de la historia] {{es icon}}, ''La Opinión Digital'', 11 September 2003. Accessed online 22 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenio Poupin, a member of the cabinet, Enrique Huerta, a palace functionary, two detectives from the Presidential security detail, and some GAPs (Presidential Security) were able to see the moment of death, or arrive a few seconds afterwards, attracted by the noise.

&lt;!--Desde el centro de la procesión se devuelve el doctor Guijón, que quiere llevar, como recuerdo para sus hijos, una máscara antigás (18). Ante el Salón Independencia oye un ruido seco. Con cierto automatismo, se asoma; alcanza a ver la contorsión hacia arriba del Presidente, que acaba de disparar el fusil-ametralladora desde el mentón hacia arriba. Con el instinto del médico, se
acerca al cuerpo y toma el pulso. A su alrededor sólo hay rugidos: balazos, incendio, gritos.
El detective David Garrido ve la escena junto a Enrique Huerta, que no se contiene:
-¡El Presidente ha muerto! ¡Viva Chile, mierda, viva Allende! -y coge la metralleta que ha dejado de lado, dispuesto a seguir luchando.
Ricardo Pincheira se la quita. Delante suyo, Arsenio Poupin saca un revólver de su camisa y trata de ponerlo sobre su sien. Otros hombres se lo arrebatan.
Siguiendo la tradición de guerra del Ejército chileno, Palacios estima que un general debe situarse en la vanguardia. En los alrededores no hay otro que él mismo. A saltos, cruza Morandé con una metralleta en ristre, y entra al Palacio cuando los prisioneros ya se agolpan en la vereda poniente.
Palacios busca un objetivo principal: el Presidente. Pregunta por él en el primer piso, y trepa a toda velocidad las escalas hacia el segundo. Entonces, un GAP rezagado asoma desde una sala y dispara una ráfaga. Un balazo rebota en un muro, pega en el casco del teniente Iván Herrera y rasga una mano del general Palacios. El teniente de Inteligencia Armando Fernández Larios, enviado a identificar a los defensores del Palacio, pasa su pañuelo al general para que lo use como venda (19).
El general avanza recorriendo las habitaciones, hasta que un subalterno le avisa que dos soldados han hallado un cuerpo en el Salón Independencia. Cuando entra, ve al doctor Guijón junto al cadáver del Presidente, al que reconoce por su macizo reloj Galga Coultre. Lo interroga brevemente, sin creerle mucho -llega a pensar que el propio doctor pudo dispararle-. Llama al oficial de radio y entrega su breve reporte al general Nuño:
-Misión cumplida. Moneda tomada, Presidente muerto (20).
A las 14.38, Carvajal informa a Pinochet y a Leigh.--&gt;

===Witnesses===
All sources seem to agree that at least the following witnesses were present:
*Dr. Patricio Guijón – member of the Presidential Medical Staff – ''Survived''
*Dr. José Quiroga – member of the Presidential Medical Staff – ''Survived''
*Arsenio Poupin Oissel – Presidential Advisor and member of the cabinet – ''Executed a few days later''
*Enrique Huerta Corvalán – Palace Intendant (governor) – ''Executed a few days later''
*David Garrido – Detective (Presidential Security Detail) – ''Survived''
*Ricardo Pincheira – Detective (Presidential Security Detail) – ''Survived''
*Pablo Manuel Zepeda Camillieri – GAP (Presidential Security) – ''Survived''

Of these witnesses, only Dr. Guijón spoke about the events immediately after they happened, and was roundly vilified for doing so. Some sources misattribute Guijón's declarations to "Allende's personal doctor", Enrique Paris Roa, who was at La Moneda not in his professional role but as a member of Allende's cabinet. He does not appear to have made any such statement as he was executed shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Anne-Marie O'Connor, [http://www.oberlin.edu/faculty/svolk/lat102200.htm Out of the Ashes], ''Los Angeles Times'' 22 October 2000. Reproduced online on the site of [[Oberlin College]] professor Steven S. Volk, accessed 22 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The other witnesses kept silent until after the restoration of democracy in Chile, as they believed (according to their own statements) that to corroborate the version of a suicide would in some measure downgrade Allende's sacrifice and lend support to the military regime.

Of the two doctors from the Moneda Palace infirmary who witnessed the suicide, Patricio Guijón made a statement at the time. However, Dr. [[José Quiroga]] only confirmed the details in 1999.&lt;ref name=Gonzalez/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pape&gt;Pape, Eric, [http://www.garella.com/rich/eric/exile.htm Five Degrees of Exile], ''[[Los Angeles Times]] Magazine'', 11 July 1999. Reproduced online as part of [http://www.garella.com/rich/eric/clips.htm an archive of Pape's articles], accessed 22 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
During the subsequent years of the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|Pinochet regime]], there existed a legitimate controversy about whether plotters of the coup d'état had assassinated Allende. The definitive finding of suicide by international experts and the Chilean courts in 2011 seems to have put the controversy to rest. Almost all claims of an ongoing "controversy" regarding Allende's death seem to predate the 2011 investigations and the factual record left in its wake.

[[Fidel Castro]], who had given President Allende the AK-47 used as the suicide weapon, provides an example of the speculation and political posturing that grew out of Allende's death and the Pinochet coup d'état. On 28 September 1973 (only two weeks after Allende's death), Castro told a Cuban crowd in [[Havana]]'s ''Plaza de la Revolución'' that Allende had died in [[Palacio de La Moneda|La Moneda]] wrapped in a Chilean flag, firing at Pinochet troops with Fidel's rifle. Over the coming decades, the Cuban leader would continue to make public addresses using this version of events.
Castro's public statements formed the basis of Robinson Rojas' 1975 book ''The murder of Allende and the end of the Chilean way to socialism''. Rojas asserted that the Chilean president had been killed by Pinochet's military forces while defending the palace.&lt;ref&gt;Rojas, Robinson (1985). ''The Murder of Allende and the End of the Chilean Way to Socialism''. Joanna Cotler Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Chilean transition to democracy|peaceful transition to democracy]] in Chile in 1990, the view that Allende committed suicide began to gain popular acceptance as different testimonies confirming the details of the suicide have become available in press and in documentary interviews.&lt;ref name=Gonzalez/&gt; Likewise, members of Allende's immediate family including his wife and his daughter, have never disputed that it was a suicide.&lt;ref name=PERIODISTA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.estadao.com.br/internacional/not_int239424,0.htm |title='&amp;#39;EUA tentaram impedir posse de Allende, diz documento.'&amp;#39; Washington: Associated Press-Agência Estado, '&amp;#39;in'&amp;#39; '&amp;#39;O Estado de S. Paulo'&amp;#39;, september 10, 2008, 15:56 |publisher=Estadao.com.br |accessdate=2012-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227111108/http://www.estadao.com.br/internacional/not_int239424%2C0.htm |archivedate=2009-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A further example of pre-2011 controversializing is found in Chilean doctor Luis Ravanal's 2008 article published in the magazine ''El Periodista'' stating that Allende's wounds were "not compatible" with suicide. Asked to comment on Dr. Ravanal's hypothesis, the Chilean congresswoman [[Isabel Allende (politician)|Isabel Allende]], the President's daughter, said that the suicide version is the correct one.&lt;ref name=Allende&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.eluniversal.com.mx/pls/impreso/noticia.html?id_nota=164983&amp;tabla=notas |title=Admite hija de Allende suicidio de su padre |date=August 17, 2003 |publisher=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]] |location=Mexico City, Mexico |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014043246/http://www2.eluniversal.com.mx/pls/impreso/noticia.html?id_nota=164983&amp;tabla=notas |archivedate=October 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late January 2011, a Chilean judge opened an investigation into the death of Salvador Allende together with hundreds of other possible human rights abuses committed during the 1973 coup that brought Augusto Pinochet to power.&lt;ref name=inquiry&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/world/americas/28chile.html | title = Chilean Judge Orders Investigation Into Allende’s Death | publisher = ''New York Times'' | accessdate = 2011-01-28 | first=Pascale | last=Bonnefoy | date=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13096836 | title = Chile to exhume former President Salvador Allende | publisher = ''BBC News'' | accessdate = 2011-05-05 | date=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lanacion.cl/cuerpo-de-salvador-allende-sera-exhumado-el-23-de-mayo/noticias/2011-05-06/101513.html | title = Cuerpo de Salvador Allende será exhumado el 23 de mayo| publisher = ''La Nación (Chile)'' | accessdate = 2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, Allende's remains were exhumed by order of a Chilean court in furtherance of a "criminal investigation into the death of Allende." &lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/20/salvador-allende-committed-suicide-autopsy | work=The Guardian | title=Chilean president Salvador Allende committed suicide, autopsy confirms | date=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 31, 2011, before the court-ordered autopsy had been completed, Chile's [[Televisión Nacional de Chile|state television station]] reported that a top-secret military account of Allende's death had been discovered in the home of a former military justice official. The 300-page document was only found when the house was destroyed in the [[2010 Chilean earthquake]]. After reviewing the report, two forensic experts told TVN "that they are inclined to conclude that Allende was assassinated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/chile-tv-secret-military-report-on-allendes-death-raises-doubts-about-suicide/2011/05/31/AG1rkTFH_story.html | title = Chile TV: Secret military report on Allende’s death raises doubts about suicide |newspaper = [[The Washington Post]]| date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Results of the autopsy were officially released in mid-July 2011. The team of Chilean medical experts conducting and reviewing the autopsy results confirmed that Salvador Allende had died from self-inflicted gunshot wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/07/19/chile.allende/index.html | title = Former Chilean President Allende's death confirmed as suicide| publisher = CNN | accessdate = 2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The autopsy results indicated that Allende had died after shooting himself with an [[AK-47]] received as a gift from [[Fidel Castro]]. The shots tore off the top of Allende's head, killing him instantly, because the rifle had been set to automatic fire.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'', a leading UK newspaper, reported that the "scientific autopsy" had confirmed that "Salvador Allende committed suicide during the 1973 coup that toppled his socialist government." According to ''The Guardian'':&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

{{quote|British ballistics expert David Prayer said Allende died of two shots fired from an assault rifle that was held between his legs and under his chin and was set to fire automatically. The bullets blew out the top of his head and killed him instantly. 

The forensics team's conclusion was unanimous. Spanish expert Francisco Etxeberria said: "We have absolutely no doubt" that Allende committed suicide.}}

[[File:Saint Tabitha.jpg|thumb|[[Hagiography]], fresco, of Saint Tabitha in [[Greek Orthodox Church]].]]
'''Dorcas''' ({{lang-el|Δορκάς}}, ''Dorkás''; {{lang-arc|טביתא}} ''Ṭabītā'') was a [[disciple (Christianity)|disciple]] who lived in [[Jaffa|Joppa]], referenced in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|9:36–42}}) in the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref name=Syswerda&gt;{{cite book|last=Syswerda|first=Jean E.|title=Women of the Bible : 52 Bible studies for individuals and groups|year=2002|publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|isbn=0310244927|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her name in the [[Textus Receptus]] is "Ταβιθά" (Tabitha).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/9/36/p0/t_conc_1027036|title=Acts 9:36 (KJV)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[October 25]]he [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] celebrates [[Saint]] Tabitha the Widow, raised from the dead by the Apostle Peter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://oca.org/saints/lives/2018/10/25/103058-st-tabitha-the-widow-raised-from-the-dead-by-the-apostle-peter | title = Commemoration of St. Tabitha the Widow | language = en | website = Orthodox Church of America | access-date = Oct 7, 2018 | archive-url = http://archive.is/qNdJk | archive-date = Oct 11, 2018 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Acts recounts that when she died, she was mourned by "all the widows...crying and showing (Peter) the robes and other clothing that she had made while she was still with them" (Acts 9:39).&lt;ref name=Syswerda /&gt; The Greek construct used in this passage indicates that the widows were the recipients of her charity,&lt;ref name="Bock"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bock|first=Darrell L. |title=Acts (Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament) |year=2007|publisher=Baker Books |isbn=1441200266|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=smkvXcfFBBwC&amp;pg=PA378|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she may also have been a widow herself.&lt;ref name="Gangel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gangel|first=Kenneth O. |title=Holman New Testament Commentary - Acts |year=1998|publisher=B&amp;H Publishing Group |isbn=0805402055 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s_rs-CRacHYC&amp;pg=PA146 |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that she was a woman of some means, given her ability to help the poor.&lt;ref name="Witherington"&gt;{{cite book|last=Witherington |first=Ben |title=The Acts of the Apostles: A Socio-rhetorical Commentary |year=1998|publisher=Wm.

The name ''Dorcas'' is a Greek translation of the Aramaic name ''Tabitha'', meaning "[[gazelle]]".&lt;ref name=Lockyer&gt;{{cite book|last=Lockyer|first=Herbert|title=All the women of the Bible|year=1967|publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=0310281512|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0YrW3bxxGAsC&amp;pg=PA46 |pages=46–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; One species of gazelle is now known as the [[Dorcas Gazelle|dorcas gazelle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hildyard |first= Anne [ed.] |title=Endangered wildlife and  of the world|year=2001|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0761471944|page=606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Christian tradition==
[[File:Raising of Tabitha.JPG|thumb|Section of ''Healing of the Cripple and Raising of Tabitha'' by [[Masolino da Panicale]], 1425.]]

Dorcas, along with [[Lydia of Thyatira]] and [[Phoebe (biblical figure)|Phoebe]], is honored with a [[feast day]] on the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] on January 27.&lt;ref name="Pfatteicher"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pfatteicher|first=Philip H.|title=The new book of festivals and commemorations : a proposed common calendar of saints|year=2008|publisher=Fortress Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=9780800621285|page=683}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Evangelical Lutheran Church also places their [[Calendar of saints (Lutheran)|joint commemoration]] on January 27, immediately after the male missionaries remembered after the feast of St. Paul's Conversion, but the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod (LCMS) commemorates these three faithful women on October 25.&lt;ref name="Pfatteicher"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinnaman|first=Scot A.|title=Lutheranism 101|year=2010|publisher=Concordia Publishing House|location=St. Louis|isbn=9780758625052|page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church commemorates Dorcas (under the Aramaic version of her name, St Tabitha) on October 25,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheehan|first=Thomas W.|title=Dictionary of Patron Saints' Names |year=2001|publisher=Our Sunday Visitor Publishing |isbn=0879735392|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same date as the Eastern Church.&lt;ref name="Pfatteicher"/&gt; [[Dorcas Society|Dorcas societies]], which provide clothing to the poor, are named after her.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;

[[File:Dorcas Window Mytholmroyd.jpg|thumb|left|Dorcas Window St. Michael's Parish Church, [[Mytholmroyd]], West Yorkshire]]
[[Basil of Caesarea]] refers to Dorcas as an example in his ''Morals'' (rule 74): "That a widow who enjoys sufficiently robust health should spend her life in works of zeal and solicitude, keeping in mind the words of the Apostle and the example of Dorcas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Basil|first=Saint|title=Ascetical Works |year=1999 |publisher=CUA Press |isbn=0813211093 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F4GRmOIddMgC&amp;pg=PA191 |page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also commemorated in poems by [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]] ("The Widows' Tears: Or, Dirge of Dorcas") and [[George MacDonald]] ("Dorcas").

==In art==
Depictions of Dorcas in art can be found as early as the fourth century, and her raising is often included in Medieval and Renaissance illustrations of the life of [[Saint Peter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Leslie |title=Medieval Art: A Topical Dictionary |year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0313293295 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b-5YPoia7qwC&amp;pg=PA239 |page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Earls|first=Irene |title=Renaissance Art: A Topical Dictionary |year=1987|publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=0313293295 |page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorcas' acts of charity are a common subject of [[stained glass]] church windows. She is represented in a window in the apse of [[Christ Church, Bath]], on the south side of [[St Peter's Church, Caversham]], in [[Church of St Andrew, Cheddar|St. Andrew's Church, Cheddar]], in the sacristy of [[Calvary Episcopal Church (Pittsburgh)]], in [[Llandaff Cathedral]] in [[Cardiff]], in [[St Leonard's Church, Bridgnorth]], in [[Castleton, Derbyshire|Castleton]] Parish Church in Derbyshire, on the north side of St. Nicholas' church in [[Castle Hedingham]] in Essex, in the Ladychapel of St Michael's Church in [[Mytholmroyd]], West Yorkshire, and in an oriel window at the Head Office of the [[Retail Trust]] in north London.

The [[Lady chapel]] of [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]] has a window of Dorcas with the legend: "Dorcas this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds". Christ Church, [[St. Joseph, Missouri]], depicts her holding a blue cloth in a prominent nave window (1885) on the south side. Grace and Holy Trinity Episcopal Church in [[Richmond, Virginia]] has her in a window made in Germany around 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ghtc.org/index.php/about/history-of-grace-and-holy-trinity-church/the-dorcas-window/ |title=Grace &amp; Holy Trinity Church: The Dorcas Window |accessdate=2013-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorcas and [[Cornelius the Centurion|Cornelius]] are represented on the stained glass windows above the altar in the Emmanuel Anglican Church in [[Lawson, New South Wales]]. In the church of St. Lawrence, [[Weston under Penyard]], Herefordshire, she is depicted with [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] in a pair of stained glass windows dedicated to the memory of Edward Burdett Hawkshaw, the Rector from 1854-1912, and his wife, Catherine (a photograph nearby in the church shows that his likeness is the face given to St. Paul, while Dorcas has the face of Mrs. Hawkshaw).

'''Edward Higgins White II''' (November 14, 1930&amp;nbsp;– January 27, 1967), ([[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lt Col]], [[USAF]]), was an American [[aeronautical engineer]], [[U.S. Air Force|U.S. Air Force officer]], [[test pilot]], and [[NASA]] [[astronaut]]. On June 3, 1965, he became the first American to [[Extra-vehicular activity|walk in space]]. White died along with astronauts [[Gus Grissom|Virgil "Gus" Grissom]] and [[Roger B. Chaffee]] during prelaunch testing for the [[Apollo 1|first manned Apollo mission]] at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]]. He was awarded the [[NASA Distinguished Service Medal]] for his flight in [[Gemini 4]] and was then awarded the [[Congressional Space Medal of Honor]] posthumously.

==Biography==

===Early years, education and military service===
White was born on November 14, 1930, in [[San Antonio]], Texas, to parents [[Edward Higgins White Sr.]] (1901–1978), who became a [[Major general (United States)|major general]] in the [[U.S. Air Force]], and Mary Rosina White ({{nee|Haller}}; 1900–1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{findagrave|1093|Edward Higgins White II}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended school in his hometown and became a member of the [[Boy Scouts of America]],&lt;ref name="astro-bsa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/Media/FactSheets/02-558.aspx |title=Astronauts and the BSA |work=Fact sheet |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=March 20, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414205119/http://www.scouting.org/Media/FactSheets/02-558.aspx |archivedate=April 14, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he earned the rank of [[Ranks in the Boy Scouts of America#Second Class|Second Class Scout]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scouting.org/About/FactSheets/scouting_space.aspx Edward Higgins White at scouting.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000000/http://www.scouting.org/About/FactSheets/scouting_space.aspx |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation from high school in 1948, he was accepted to the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point]], where in 1952 he earned his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree and was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Prior to the first graduating class from the [[U.S. Air Force Academy]] in 1959, a certain percentage of officers in the U.S. Air Force were drawn from West Point and from the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. In any case, the vast majority of officers in the U.S. Armed Forces are educated and trained at the three kinds of [[R.O.T.C.]] programs at hundreds of other institutes and universities across the country.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, he attended flight school, a course that takes just over a year. Following graduation from flight school in 1953, White was assigned to the 22nd Fighter Day Squadron at [[Bitburg Air Base]], [[West Germany]]. He spent three and a half years in West Germany flying in [[F-86 Sabre]] and [[F-100 Super Sabre]] [[squadron (aviation)|squadrons]] in the defense of [[NATO]].&lt;ref name="nasabio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/white-eh.html |title=Astronaut Bio: Edward H.

After graduating from West Point, White competed for a spot on the [[U.S. Olympic team]] in the 400 meter [[hurdles]] race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/zorn/white.htm|title=Detailed Biographies of Apollo I Crew - Ed White|last1=White|first1=Mary|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; He missed making the team by only 1/10 second. His hobbies included [[Squash (sport)|squash]], [[handball]], [[Human swimming|swimming]], [[golf]], and [[photography]].&lt;ref name="mwhite"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/zorn/white.htm|last1=White|first1=Mary C.|title=Detailed Biographies of Apollo I Crew - Ed White|publisher=NASA|access-date=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, White enrolled in the [[University of Michigan]] under Air Force sponsorship to study [[Aeronautical Engineering]], where he received his [[Master of Science]] degree in 1959. Following graduation, White was selected to attend the [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School]] at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], [[California]]. He earned his credentials as a [[test pilot]] in 1959 and was assigned to the [[Aeronautical Systems Center|Aeronautical Systems Division]] at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], [[Ohio]].&lt;ref name="mwhite" /&gt; During his career, White would log more than 3,000 flight hours with the Air Force, including about 2,200 hours in [[Jet aircraft|jets]], and would ultimately attain the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]].&lt;ref name="nasabio" /&gt;

In 1953, White married Patricia Finegan, whom he met while at West Point.&lt;ref name="cmgww.com"/&gt; The Whites would have two children, Edward White III (born September 16, 1953) and Bonnie Lynn White (born May 15, 1956). White was a devout [[Methodist]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Burgess (author)|Burgess, Colin]] and Doolan, Kate, with Vis, Bert (2003).

===NASA career===

====Project Gemini====
[[File:EdWhiteFirstAmericanSpacewalker.1965.ws.jpg|thumb|Edward White during [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]]. During the [[Gemini 4]] mission, White became the first American astronaut to perform a spacewalk]]
[[File:Ed White performs first U.S. spacewalk - GPN-2006-000025.jpg|thumb|Another image of Edward White during [[Gemini 4]] performing [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]]]]
{{Main|Gemini 4}}
White was one of nine men chosen as part of [[Astronaut Group 2|the second group of astronauts]] in 1962.  Within an already elite group, White was considered to be a high-flier by the management of NASA. He was chosen as Pilot of [[Gemini 4]], with Command Pilot [[James McDivitt]]. White became the first American to make a [[Extra-vehicular activity|walk in space]], on June 3, 1965.  He found the experience so exhilarating that he was reluctant to terminate the EVA at the allotted time, and had to be ordered back into the spacecraft. While he was outside, a spare thermal glove floated away through the open hatch of the spacecraft, becoming an early piece of [[space debris]] in [[low Earth orbit]], until it burned up upon [[Atmospheric entry|re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere]]. There was a mechanical problem with the hatch mechanism, which made it difficult to open and to relatch, which added to the time constraint of the spacewalk, and could have threatened the lives of both men if McDivitt had been unable to get the hatch latched, as they could not re-enter the atmosphere with an unsealed hatch.

{{quotation|I'm coming back in... and it's the saddest moment of my life.|Astronaut Edward H. White while reentering the spacecraft after his [[extra-vehicular activity|EVA]]|&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/GT04_TEC.PDF |format= PDF |title= Composite Air-to-ground and Onboard Voice Tape Transcription of the GT-4 Mission (U) |publisher= NASA |date= 31 August 1965 |page= 54}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

White's next assignment after Gemini 4 was as the backup for [[Gemini 7]] Command Pilot [[Frank Borman]]. He was also named the astronaut specialist for the flight control systems of the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]]. By the usual procedure of crew rotation in the Gemini program, White would have been in line for a second flight as the command pilot of [[Gemini 10]] in July 1966, which would have made him the first of his group to fly twice.

====Apollo program====
[[File:Apollo1-Crew 01.jpg|left|thumb|Apollo 1 crew: [[Gus Grissom|Grissom]], White, and [[Roger B. Chaffee|Chaffee]]]]

In March 1966 he was selected as senior pilot (second seat) for the first manned Apollo flight, designated '''AS-204''', along with Command Pilot [[Virgil Grissom|Virgil "Gus" Grissom]], who had flown in space on the [[Mercury-Redstone 4|Mercury 4 ''Liberty Bell 7'']] mission and as commander of the [[Gemini 3|Gemini 3 ''Molly Brown'']] mission, and Pilot [[Roger Chaffee]], who had yet to fly into space. The mission, which the men named ''Apollo 1'' in June, was originally planned for late 1966 (perhaps concurrent with the last Gemini mission), but delays in the spacecraft development pushed the launch into 1967.

===Death===
{{Main|Apollo 1}}
[[File:Apollo 1 fire.jpg|thumb|Charred remains of the Apollo 1 [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module]], in which White was killed along with Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee]]

The launch of Apollo 1 was planned for February 21, 1967. The crew entered the spacecraft on January 27, mounted atop its [[Saturn IB]] booster on [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|Launch Pad 34]] at Cape Kennedy, for a "plugs-out" test of the spacecraft, which included a rehearsal of the launch countdown procedure. Midway through the test, a fire broke out in the pure oxygen-filled cabin, killing all three men.

White's job was to open the hatch cover in an emergency, which he apparently tried to do; his body was found in his center seat, with his arms reaching over his head toward the hatch. Removing the cover to open the hatch was impossible, because the [[plug door]] design required venting normally slightly greater-than-atmospheric pressure and pulling the cover into the cabin. Grissom was unable to reach the cabin vent control to his left, where the fire's source was located. The intense heat raised the cabin pressure even more, to the point where the cabin walls ruptured. The astronauts were killed by asphyxiation and smoke inhalation.

The fire's ignition source was determined to be a spark that jumped from a wire on the far left of the spacecraft, under Grissom's seat,&lt;ref&gt;Kluger, Jeffrey, ''Apollo 8: The Thrilling Story of the First Mission to the Moon'' (Henry Holt &amp; Co., 2017), p. 94. "At precisely 6:31 p.m., a spark jumped from a wire on the far left of the spacecraft, beneath Gus Grissom's seat. The wire ran beneath a little storage compartment with a metal door that had been opened and closed many times without anybody noticing that each time the door moved, it abraded a little more of the wire's insulation, finally leaving the wire free to spark at will. When the wire sparked during the plugs-out test, it ignited a small fire that stayed small for only a second or two. Accelerated by the pure oxygen, the flames climbed along the left-hand wall of the spacecraft, feeding on fabric and netting used for storage. That was the worst possible place for a fire to erupt, since it presented Grissom from reaching a latch that would have opened a valve and vented the high-pressure atmosphere, thus slowing the flames."&lt;/ref&gt; but their deaths were attributed to a wide range of lethal hazards in the early Apollo Command Module design and workmanship and conditions of the test, including the highly pressurized 100% [[oxygen]] pre-launch atmosphere, many wiring and plumbing flaws, flammable materials used in the cockpit and the astronauts' flight suits, and a hatch which could not be quickly opened in an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=NASA |work=Report of Apollo 204 Review Board |title=Findings, Determinations And Recommendations |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Apollo204/find.html |quote=No single ignition source of the fire was conclusively identified. |date=April 5, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the incident, these problems were fixed, and the Apollo program carried on successfully to reach its objective of landing men on the Moon.

White was buried with full [[military honors]] at [[West Point Cemetery]] while Grissom and Chaffee are both buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usma.edu/history/SiteAssets/SitePages/Cemetery/West%20Point%20Cemetery.pdf|title=West Point Cemetery|publisher=United States Military Academy West Point|access-date=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, White was posthumously awarded the [[Congressional Space Medal of Honor]].

White's wife Patricia remarried and continued to reside in Houston. On September 7, 1983, she committed suicide after surgery earlier in the year to remove a tumor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UPI |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/08/obituaries/widow-of-astronaut-is-dead.html |title=Pat White's obituary in New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1983-09-08 |accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/moon/peopleevents/p_wives.html |title=PBS's "Race to the Moon" site on Pat White's suicide |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Edward Elric'''|エドワード・エルリック|Edowādo Erurikku|lead=yes}}, commonly nicknamed {{nihongo|'''Ed'''|エド|Edo}}, is a [[fictional character]] and the protagonist of the ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]'' [[manga]] series created by [[Hiromu Arakawa]]. Edward, titled {{nihongo|"Fullmetal Alchemist"|鋼の錬金術師|Hagane no Renkinjutsushi|lit. "Alchemist of Steel"}}, is the youngest State Alchemist in the history of the fictional country of Amestris. His left leg was divinely severed in a failed attempt to resurrect his dead mother, and then his right arm was taken in exchange for his brother's soul. His missing limbs have been replaced with [[Retrofuturism|sophisticated]] [[Prosthesis|prosthetics]] called {{nihongo|automail|&lt;ruby&gt;&lt;rb&gt;機械鎧&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;オートメイル&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt;|ōtomeiru}}. He and his younger brother, [[Alphonse Elric|Alphonse]], who lost his entire body and is spiritually bound to a suit of armor, scour the world in search of the [[Philosopher's Stone]] in the hopes of restoring their bodies. Ed has appeared in other media from the series, including [[video games]], [[original video animation]]s (OVAs) and [[light novel]]s.

Numerous publications in various media have been written on the subject of Edward's character. Reviewers praised Edward as a balance between the typical clever kid and the stubborn kid persona. Additionally, his comedic moments have been celebrated as some of the best moments in the series. His Japanese and English voice actors, [[Romi Park]] and [[Vic Mignogna]], have both been praised for their performances as Edward Elric and have won several awards for their work. Numerous pieces of merchandise have been released bearing Edward's likeness, including key chains and action figures.

==Creation and conception==
Author [[Hiromu Arakawa]] integrated several social problems into the plot, such as the way Edward and Alphonse live as brothers after the death of their mother, Trisha. She also looks at how the brothers help people all over the country to gain an understanding of the meaning of family.&lt;ref name="new"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Equivalent Change |journal=[[Newtype USA]] |volume=5 |issue=1 |page=24 | publication-date=January 2006 |publisher=[[A.D.

As a result, Van Hohenheim's reappearance caused a shocking and terrified reaction in the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Arakawa | first=Hiromu | title=Fullmetal Alchemist Rough Sketch Gallery|trans-title=| year=2006 | publisher=Square Enix|page=29| isbn=978-4-7575-1695-3  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arakawa has noted that Edward is one of her favorite characters from the series, although she denied having the same personality as him when one of her assistants mentioned it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arakawa, Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist Profiles|pages=100–105|year=2006|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-4215-0768-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When comparing the two brothers during the time Alphonse obtained the ability to use alchemy without a circle like Edward, Arakawa stated nobody was better at alchemy as the two had different preferences in the same way as other alchemist appearing in the series.&lt;ref name="guide2"&gt;{{cite book | last=Arakawa | first=Hiromu | title=鋼の錬金術師 パーフェクトガイドブック 2|trans-title=| year=2005 | publisher=Square Enix|pages=168–172| isbn=978-4-7575-1426-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she claims she has not thought of the characters' birthdates, Arakawa noted that she decided Edward's birthdate during the series' serialization. During a chapter in which it was mentioned that Edward was about to be 16, winter was about to begin in Hokkaido, Arakawa's birthplace, so it was decided Edward's birthdate would be in winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arakawa|first=Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 12|year=2007|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|page=184|isbn=978-1-4215-0839-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a common [[slapstick]] gag from the series, Edward is often struck by Winry Rockbell's [[wrench]].

The appearance of his automail in the anime is used to symbolize the intangibles of his character, making viewers note that Edward lost something important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Fullmetal Alchemist |journal=[[Newtype USA]] |volume=5 |issue=3 |page=32 | publication-date=March 2006 |publisher=[[A.D.

In a prototype from the series, Edward was an eighteen-year-old teenager travelling alongside his father whose soul sealed in a [[flying squirrel]]. Edward's prototype had an average height, but retained his automail. In order to fit with the readers from the manga magazine ''Monthly Shonen Gangan'', Edward's traits were further modified, leaving his current one. His height was reduced in order to contrast with Alphonse's huge armor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Arakawa | first=Hiromu | journal=TV Bros|title=アニメ開始ごろ|date=December 2003 | publisher=Nyusu|url=http://www3.atwiki.jp/fa/pages/38.html  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the design of the character, Arakawa is often worried about not making his automail too bulky to avoid balancing it by increasing Edward's muscles, making his appearance unsuitable for his age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Arakawa | first=Hiromu | title=Fullmetal Alchemist Rough Sketch Gallery|trans-title=| year=2006 | publisher=Square Enix|page=7| isbn=978-4-7575-1695-3  }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also often drawn the character in full body length, but at one point noticed she made it too tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Arakawa | first=Hiromu | title=Fullmetal Alchemist Rough Sketch Gallery|trans-title=| year=2006 | publisher=Square Enix|page=15| isbn=978-4-7575-1695-3  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Arakawa | first=Hiromu | title=Fullmetal Alchemist Rough Sketch Gallery|trans-title=| year=2006 | publisher=Square Enix|page=23| isbn=978-4-7575-1695-3  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the manga continued serialization, Arakawa found that she drew Edward half naked several times even more than [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Alex Louis Armstrong|Alex Louis Armstrong]] who tends to show his torso. While stating that this was because she wanted to draw Edward's automail, she commented that it was common for men to walk in underwear at their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Arakawa | first=Hiromu | title=The Art Of Fullmetal Alchemist| year=2005 | publisher=Viz Media|pages=94–95| isbn=978-1-4215-0158-1  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Japanese version of ''Fullmetal Alchemist''{{'}}s anime adaptations, Edward has been voiced by [[Romi Park]]. In the English version, the role has been played by [[Vic Mignogna]].&lt;ref name="japvoice"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Those Who Challenge the Sun|airdate=November 6, 2004|credits=Director: Seiji Mizushima|series=Fullmetal Alchemist|network=Cartoon Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mignogna has stated that performing Edward may be his biggest voice acting achievement since fans do not compare him with Park, noting that their voices are not similar and that he did not plan to sound like her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Vic Mignogna|url=http://www.mania.com/being-brief-discussion-vic-mignogna_article_84273.html|author=Jeng, Way|date=April 19, 2005|publisher=Mania Entertainment|accessdate=April 2, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207030519/http://www.mania.com/being-brief-discussion-vic-mignogna_article_84273.html|archivedate=December 7, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in the upcoming live-action of the series, Edward will be portrayed by [[Ryosuke Yamada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2016/04/03-1/dean-fujioka-and-others-join-live-action-fullmetal-alchemist-film|title=Dean Fujioka and Others Join Live-Action "Fullmetal Alchemist" Film |publisher=Crunchyroll|accessdate=April 3, 2016|date=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yamada thinks his short starture might be work as an advantage due to one of Edward's most common characteristics is his low height. Studying Arakawa's manga, Yamada tried imitating Edward's other signature actions such the way he runs. A fan of the series, the actor expressed happiness with the role he was given. Nevertheless, in [[Anime Expo]] 2017 if anything from him looked "weird" which resulted in praise from the audience. During questions, Yamada said that one of the most difficult scenes about his acting is interacting with Alphonse as a result of the latter being CGI. As a result, in the shooting of some scenes the staff had a person in Alphonse's place  so that Yamada had a better way to act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2017/anime-expo/fullmetal-alchemist-live-action-film-panel-q-a/.118435|title=Fullmetal Alchemist Live-Action Film Panel + Q&amp;A|last=Loveridge|first=Lynzee |publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=July 5, 2017|date=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward lost his left leg while meeting the metaphysical being known as {{nihongo4|Truth|真理|Shinri}}, gaining great knowledge as well as the prodigious ability to perform transmutations just by clapping his hands together without the need of a Transmutation Circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arakawa|first=Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 2|year=2005|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=Chapter 6|page=94|isbn=978-1-59116-923-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Alphonse's entire being was taken by Truth, Edward uses his newly gained knowledge in sacrificing his own right arm to retrieve Alphonse's soul and bind it to a nearby suit of armor.&lt;ref name="c23"/&gt; Later meeting Colonel Roy Mustang while being outfitted prosthetic "automail" limbs by the grandmother of his childhood friend, [[Winry Rockbell]], motivated to restore Alphonse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arakawa|first=Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 4|year=2005|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=Chapter 15|page=98|isbn=978-1-59116-929-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward joins the State Military. He becomes youngest State Alchemist, receiving the title of "Fullmetal Alchemist" shortly thereafter from the military head, [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#King Bradley|King Bradley]].

Edward is extremely idealistic, and strongly believes in the alchemical concept of "Equivalent Exchange," though he also behaves in a childish manner and can violently lash out when confronted about his short height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arakawa|first=Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 1|year=2005|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=Omake|isbn=978-1-59116-920-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arakawa|first=Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 4|year=2005|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=Chapter 14|page=65|isbn=978-1-59116-929-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides his abilities as an alchemist, Edward is a formidable fighter as a result of his training with Izumi, who had extensively trained both brothers in [[martial arts]].&lt;ref name="c23"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arakawa|first=Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 6|year=2006|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=Chapter 23|isbn=978-1-4215-0319-6|pages=61–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their search for the Stone, from liberating the town of Liore from the cult leader Father Cornello to their tragic meeting with Nina Tucker and her desperate father Shou Tucker, Edward and Alphonse had a near-death experience when attacked by [[Scar (Fullmetal Alchemist)|Scar]], a vengeful Ishbalan targeting State Alchemists for the mass murder of his people during the Ishbal Civil War. This led to the Elrics making a brief return to Resembool with Winry becoming Edward's automail mechanic, the brothers encountering a former State Alchemist named Tim Marcoh who gives them the method of creating a Philosopher's Stone. The brothers, deciding to find another means upon learning human souls are required to create a Philosopher's Stone, get later revelations in the form of immortal beings known as the [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Homunculi|homunculi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arakawa|first=Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 6|year=2006|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|chapter=Chapter 24|page=|isbn=978-1-4215-0319-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several publications for manga, anime, and other pop culture media have provided both praise and criticism on Edward's character. IGN writer Hilary Goldstein praises Edward as the perfect balance between the typical clever kid and the stubborn kid persona, explaining that this allows the character to "float between comical moments and underlying drama without seeming false."&lt;ref name="balance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/598/598355p1.html|title=Fullmetal Alchemist Vol. 1 Review|author=Goldstein, Hilary|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=March 5, 2005|accessdate=March 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Melissa Harper from [[Anime News Network]] praises Edward's facial expressions as some of the most humorous highlights of the series, including also the moments in which he reacts quite violently to comments about his small stature. They also praise him for not being a stereotypical ''[[Shōnen manga|shōnen]]'' character as it is noted that he has "very real skills, relationships, and personality".&lt;ref name="comedy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/fullmetal-alchemist-gn-1-3|author=Harper, Melissa|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|title=Fullmetal Alchemist gn 1–3|date=November 11, 2006|accessdate=March 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Arbogast from T.H.E.M.

In ''(Fullmetal) alchemy: the monstrosity of reading words and pictures in shonen manga'', Lesley-Anne Gallacher addressed how the backstory of Edward and Alphonse's failed attempt to revive their mother relate to Shou Tucker's plan to combine his daughter Nina and dog into a monster named chimera. During the discovery of this, Edward and Alphonse are given their own contrast in terms of characterization with the former showing early shock due to understanding what happened to Nina. Nevertheless, Alphonse later reacts violently too once understanding the identity of the chimera. As a result, the writer believes the story "weaken the boundaries between different realms of representation is to compromise the integrity of them all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gallacher|first=

Sadlier further commented on Edward's past, comparing it with Ishvalian's civil war who also suffered a tragic loss, most notably the antagonistic Scar who also lost his arm. Other foils noticed by the writer are Lan Fan who amputated herself to aid Ling Yao while noting that through his automail, Arakawa managed to link Edward with Alphonse and Winry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Sadlier|first=Julie|year=2013 |title=Embodiment, Disability and Social Violence in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood|work= |publisher=York University|publication-place= |page= |url=https://surface.syr.edu/bts_conf/2013/Presentations/4/ |accessdate=July 14, 2018 |isbn= |issn= |oclc= }}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tien-yi Chao from Intellect commented on Edward's characterization in the film ''Conqueror of Shamballa''. Across the movie, Edward meets parallel version of people he met including Maes Hughes (a Nazi soldier with the same name) and King Bradley, (a Jewish director film director named [[Fritz Lang]]), who behave differently from their Amestris counterparts. Chao addresses that through this exchanges the film also parallels itself from Arakawa's original work that takes a different path in terms of story. Nevertheless, Edward also faces the idea of going back to Amestris and comes in terms with Earth during the climax: in confrontation to Exckhart from the [[Thule Society]], Edward notes that both worlds share similar issues, most notably wars which might become easier to occur if the worlds are connected. As a result, Edward and Alphonse decide to live in the real world in order to protect it from nuclear weapons mentioned across the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Chao|first=Tien-yi|year=2013 |title=Transmutation of worlds: Adaptation and transformation in Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa|work= |publisher=Intellect |publication-place= |page= |url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/stic/2013/00000004/00000001/art00012 |accessdate=July 14, 2018 |isbn= |issn= |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent advances in the field of electronic skin have focused on incorporating green materials ideals and environmental awareness into the design process. As one of the main challenges facing electronic skin development is the ability of the material to withstand mechanical strain and maintain sensing ability or electronic properties, recyclability and self-healing properties are especially critical in the future design of new electronic skins.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zou|first=Zhanan|last2=Zhu|first2=Chengpu|last3=Li|first3=Yan|last4=Lei|first4=Xingfeng|last5=Zhang|first5=Wei|last6=Xiao|first6=Jianliang|date=2018-02-01|title=Rehealable, fully recyclable, and malleable electronic skin enabled by dynamic covalent thermoset nanocomposite|url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/2/eaaq0508|journal=Science Advances|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=eaaq0508|doi=10.1126/sciadv.aaq0508|issn=2375-2548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rehealable electronic skin==
Self-healing abilities of electronic skin are critical to potential applications of electronic skin in fields such as soft robotics.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Proper design of self-healing electronic skin requires not only healing of the base substrate but also the reestablishment of any sensing functions such as tactile sensing or electrical conductivity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Ideally, the self-healing process of electronic skin does not rely upon outside stimulation such as increased temperature, pressure, or solvation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Self-healing, or rehealable, electronic skin is often achieved through a polymer-based material or a hybrid material.

===Polymer-based materials===
In 2018, Zou ''et al.'' published work on electronic skin that is able to reform covalent bonds when damaged.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The group looked at a polyimine-based crosslinked network, synthesized as seen in Figure 1. The e-skin is considered rehealable because of “reversible bond exchange,” meaning that the bonds holding the network together are able to break and reform under certain conditions such as solvation and heating. The rehealable and reusable aspect of such a thermoset material is unique because many thermoset materials irreversibly form crosslinked networks through covalent bonds.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Polymerization|last=Odian|first=George|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the polymer network the bonds formed during the healing process are indistinguishable from the original polymer network.  
[[File:Polymerization scheme for formation of polyimine-based self-healing e-skin.svg|center|thumb|450x450px|Figure 1. Polymerization scheme for formation of polyimine-based self-healing electronic skin. ]]

Dynamic non-covalent crosslinking has also been shown to form a polymer network that is rehealable. In 2016, Oh ''et al.'' looked specifically at semiconducting polymers for organic transistors.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oh|first=Jin Young|last2=Rondeau-Gagné|first2=Simon|last3=Chiu|first3=Yu-Cheng|last4=Chortos|first4=Alex|last5=Lissel|first5=Franziska|last6=Wang|first6=Ging-Ji Nathan|last7=Schroeder|first7=Bob C.|last8=Kurosawa|first8=Tadanori|last9=Lopez|first9=Jeffrey|date=November 2016|title=Intrinsically stretchable and healable semiconducting polymer for organic transistors|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nature20102|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=539|issue=7629|pages=411–415|doi=10.1038/nature20102|issn=1476-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that incorporating 2,6-pyridine dicarboxamide (PDCA) into the polymer backbone could impart self-healing abilities based on the network of hydrogen bonds formed between groups. With incorporation of PDCA in the polymer backbone, the materials was able to withstand up to 100% strain without showing signs of microscale cracking. In this example, the hydrogen bonds are available for energy dissipation as the strain increases. 

===Hybrid materials===
Polymer networks are able to facilitate dynamic healing processes through hydrogen bonds or dynamic covalent chemistry.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However, the incorporation of inorganic particles can greatly expand the functionality of polymer-based materials for electronic skin applications. The incorporation of micro-structured nickel particles into a polymer network (Figure 2) has been shown to maintain self-healing properties based on the reformation of hydrogen bonding networks around the inorganic particles.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The material is able to regain its conductivity within 15 seconds of breakage, and the mechanical properties are regained after 10 minutes at room temperature without added stimulus. This material relies on hydrogen bonds formed between urea groups when they align. The hydrogen atoms of urea functional groups are ideally situated to form a hydrogen-bonding network because they are near an electron-withdrawing carbonyl group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amendola|first=Valeria|last2=Fabbrizzi|first2=Luigi|last3=Mosca|first3=Lorenzo|date=2010-09-17|title=Anion recognition by hydrogen bonding: urea-based receptors|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=b822552b|journal=Chemical Society Reviews|language=en|volume=39|issue=10|doi=10.1039/b822552b|issn=1460-4744}}&lt;/ref&gt; This polymer network with embedded nickel particles demonstrates the possibility of using polymers as supramolecular hosts to develop self-healing conductive composites.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 
[[File:Self-healing material based on hydrogen bonding and interactions with micro-structured nickel particles.svg|center|thumb|647x647px|Figure 2. Self-healing material based on hydrogen bonding and interactions with micro-structured nickel particles.]]

Flexible and porous graphene foams that are interconnected in a 3D manner have also been shown to have self-healing properties.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thin film with poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamde)-poly(vinyl alcohol) (PDMAA) and reduced graphene oxide have shown high electrical conductivity and self-healing properties. The healing abilities of the hybrid composite are suspected to be due to the hydrogen bonds between the PDMAA chains, and the healing process is able to restore initial length and recover conductive properties.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

== Recyclable electronic skin ==
Zou ''et al''. presents an interesting advance in the field of electronic skin that can be used in robotics, prosthetics, and many other applications in the form of a fully recyclable electronic skin material.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The e-skin developed by the group consists of a network of covalently bound polymers that are thermoset, meaning cured at a specific temperature. However, the material is also recyclable and reusable. Because the polymer network is thermoset, it is chemically and thermally stable.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, at room temperature, the polyimine material, with or without silver nanoparticles, can be dissolved on the timescale of a few hours. The recycling process allows devices, which are damaged beyond self-healing capabilities, to be dissolved and formed into new devices (Figure 3).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This advance opens the door for lower cost production and greener approaches to e-skin development.

== Flexible and stretchy electronic skin ==
The ability of electronic skin to withstand mechanical deformation including stretching and flexing without losing functionality is crucial for its applications as prosthetics, artificial intelligence, soft robotics, health monitoring, biocompatibility, and communication devices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Savagatrup|first=Suchol|last2=Zhao|first2=Xikang|last3=Chan|first3=Esther|last4=Mei|first4=Jianguo|last5=Lipomi|first5=Darren J.|date=2016-10-01|title=Effect of Broken Conjugation on the Stretchability of Semiconducting Polymers|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/marc.201600377/abstract|journal=Macromolecular Rapid Communications|language=en|volume=37|issue=19|pages=1623–1628|doi=10.1002/marc.201600377|issn=1521-3927}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flexible electronics are often designed by depositing electronic materials on flexible polymer substrates, thereby relying on an organic substrate to impart favorable mechanical properties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Stretchable e-skin materials have been approached from two directions. Hybrid materials can rely on an organic network for stretchiness while embedding inorganic particles or sensors, which are not inherently stretchable. Other research has focused on developing stretchable materials that also have favorable electronic or sensing capabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Zou ''et al.'' studied the inclusion of linkers that are described as “serpentine” in their polyimine matrix.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These linkers make the e-skin sensors able to flex with movement and distortion. The incorporation of alkyl spacers in polymer-based materials has also been shown to increase flexibility without decreasing charge transfer mobility.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Oh ''et al.'' developed a stretchable and flexible material based on 3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-''c'']pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP) and non-conjugated 2,6-pyridine dicarboxamide (PDCA) as a source of hydrogen bonds (Figure 4).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 
[[File:A stretchable and self-healing seminconducting polymer-based material.svg|center|thumb|647x647px|Figure 4. A stretchable and self-healing semiconducting polymer-based material.]]

Graphene has also been show to be a suitable material for electronic skin applications as well due to its stiffness and tensile strength.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Núñez|first=Carlos García|last2=Navaraj|first2=William Taube|last3=Polat|first3=Emre O.|last4=Dahiya|first4=Ravinder|date=2017-05-01|title=Energy-Autonomous, Flexible, and Transparent Tactile Skin|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.201606287/abstract|journal=Advanced Functional Materials|language=en|volume=27|issue=18|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1002/adfm.201606287|issn=1616-3028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graphene is an appealing material because its synthesis to flexible substrates is scalable and cost-efficient.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Conductive electronic skin ==
The development of conductive electronic skin is of interest for many electrical applications.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Segev-Bar|first=Meital|last2=Landman|first2=Avigail|last3=Nir-Shapira|first3=Maayan|last4=Shuster|first4=Gregory|last5=Haick|first5=Hossam|date=2013-06-26|title=Tunable Touch Sensor and Combined Sensing Platform: Toward Nanoparticle-based Electronic Skin|url=https://doi.org/10.1021/am400757q|journal=ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces|volume=5|issue=12|pages=5531–5541|doi=10.1021/am400757q|issn=1944-8244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into conductive electronic skin has taken two routes: conductive self-healing polymers or embedding conductive inorganic materials in non-conductive polymer networks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The self-healing conductive composite synthesized by Tee ''et al''. (Figure 2)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; investigated the incorporation of micro-structured nickel particles into a polymer host. The nickel particles adhere to the network though favorable interactions between the native oxide layer on the surface of the particles and the hydrogen-bonding polymer.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Nanoparticles have also been studied for their ability to impart conductivity on electronic skin materials.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Zou ''et al.'' embedded silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) into a polymer matrix, making the e-skin conductive. The healing process for this material is noteworthy because it not only restores the mechanical properties of the polymer network, but also restores the conductive properties when silver nanoparticles have been embedded in the polymer network.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Sensing ability of electronic skin ==
Some of the challenges that face electronic skin sensing abilities include the fragility of sensors, the recovery time of sensors, repeatability, overcoming mechanical strain, and long-term stability.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Minhoon|last2=Park|first2=Yong Ju|last3=Chen|first3=Xiang|last4=Park|first4=Yon-Kyu|last5=Kim|first5=Min-Seok|last6=Ahn|first6=Jong-Hyun|date=2016-04-01|title=MoS2-Based Tactile Sensor for Electronic Skin Applications|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.201505124/abstract|journal=Advanced Materials|language=en|volume=28|issue=13|pages=2556–2562|doi=10.1002/adma.201505124|issn=1521-4095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tactile sensors===
Applied pressure can be measured by monitoring changes in resistance or capacitance.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Coplanar interdigitated electrodes embedded on single-layer graphene have been shown to provide pressure sensitivity for applied pressure as low as 0.11 kPa through measuring changes in capacitance.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Piezoresistive sensors have also shown high levels of sensitivity.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Ultrathin molybdenum disulfide sensing arrays integrated with graphene have demonstrated promising mechanical properties capable of pressure sensing.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Modifications of organic field effect transistors (OFETs) have shown promise in electronic ski applications.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mannsfeld|first=Stefan C.

The deformation of the thin film allows for storage and release of energy.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Visual representation of applied pressure has been one area of interest in development of tactile sensors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Chuan|last2=Hwang|first2=David|last3=Yu|first3=Zhibin|last4=Takei|first4=Kuniharu|last5=Park|first5=Junwoo|last6=Chen|first6=Teresa|last7=Ma|first7=Biwu|last8=Javey|first8=Ali|date=October 2013|title=User-interactive electronic skin for instantaneous pressure visualization|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nmat3711|journal=Nature Materials|language=En|volume=12|issue=10|pages=899–904|doi=10.1038/nmat3711|issn=1476-4660}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bao Group at Stanford University have designed an electrochromically active electronic skin that changes color with different amounts of applied pressure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Applied pressure can also be visualized by incorporation of active-matrix organic light-emitting diode displays which emit light when pressure is applied.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===Other sensing applications===
Humidity sensors have been incorporated in electronic skin design with sulfurized tungsten films. The conductivity of the film changes with different levels of humidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guo|first=Huayang|last2=Lan|first2=Changyong|last3=Zhou|first3=Zhifei|last4=Sun|first4=Peihua|last5=Wei|first5=Dapeng|last6=Li|first6=Chun|date=2017-05-18|title=Transparent, flexible, and stretchable WS2 based humidity sensors for electronic skin|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C7NR01016H|journal=Nanoscale|language=en|volume=9|issue=19|pages=6246–6253|doi=10.1039/c7nr01016h|issn=2040-3372}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon nanoribbons have also been studied for their application as temperature, pressure, and humidity sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Jaemin|last2=Lee|first2=Mincheol|last3=Shim|first3=Hyung Joon|last4=Ghaffari|first4=Roozbeh|last5=Cho|first5=Hye Rim|last6=Son|first6=Donghee|last7=Jung|first7=Yei Hwan|last8=Soh|first8=Min|last9=Choi|first9=Changsoon|date=2014-12-09|title=Stretchable silicon nanoribbon electronics for skin prosthesis|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6747|journal=Nature Communications|language=En|volume=5|pages=5747|doi=10.1038/ncomms6747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Engel scale''' was developed by James F. Engel, as a way of representing the journey from no knowledge of God, through to spiritual maturity as a [[Christian]] believer. The model is used by some Christians to emphasize the ''process'' of [[Religious conversion|conversion]] and the various decision-making steps that a person goes through in becoming a Christian.&lt;ref name="Evangelical Dictionary of World Missions"&gt;A. Scott Moreau, [[Harold A. Netland]], Charles Edward van Engen, David Burnett  ''Evangelical Dictionary of World Missions''&lt;/ref&gt;

Engel and W.&amp;nbsp;H. Norton, ''What's Gone Wrong With the Harvest?''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.&amp;nbsp;F. Engel, ''Contemporary Christian Communication''&lt;/ref&gt;

The original model was developed by James F. Engel and Viggo Søgaard, although this was later refined by Engel, who added several ideas from behavioural science, and published it in his 1975 book ''What's Gone Wrong With the Harvest''. According to this model, everyone is somewhere on this scale.&lt;ref name="Evangelical Dictionary of World Missions"/&gt;

The Engel scale has been criticized for its fixed linear approach, moreover a number of people have since introduced modifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hazelden.org.uk/pt02/art_pt068_modified_engel_full.htm|title= The Modified Engel Scale (Complete) - an article by Paul Hazelden|website=hazelden.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these is the Gray Matrix by Frank Gray of Far East Broadcasting Company (FEBC International), which is a two-dimensional model showing progression along two scales: knowledge of the Gospel and attitude toward it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thegraymatrix.org The Gray Matrix Home Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evan Frank Mottram Durbin''' (1 March 1906 – 3 September 1948)&lt;ref&gt;{{Rayment-hc|e|1|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a British economist and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician, whose writings combined a belief in central [[economic planning]] with a conviction that the price mechanism of markets was indispensable.

Historian [[David Kynaston]] described Durbin as "the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]'s most interesting thinker of the 1940s and arguably of the twentieth century".

== Early life ==
Durbin was born in 1906, the son of a Baptist minister. He was educated at Plympton and Exmouth Elementary Schools; [[Hele's School, Exeter|Heles School, Exeter]]; [[Taunton School]]; and [[New College, Oxford]]. At Oxford he studied zoology, followed by PPE, and became one of what Ben Pimlott described as 'the "Cole group" of distinguished young socialists'.&lt;ref name="Pimlott"&gt;Pimlott, Ben "Harold Wilson" Harper Collins (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}} He befriended [[Hugh Gaitskell]] (later, leader of the Labour Party 1955–63) during the General Strike of 1926, when he undertook public speaking tasks on behalf of the strikers in and around Oxford, and Gaitskell acted as his driver.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;Williams, Philip M. "Hugh Gaitskell" OUP (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}} In 1929, he was awarded a Ricardo scholarship to study economics at [[University College London|University College, London]], where Gaitskell was already on the teaching staff&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|39–40}} and their friendship, which lasted until Durbin's death, cemented itself.

== Economic career ==
In autumn 1930 he was appointed to a lectureship in economics at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE), where he remained until 1940. Lecturer and Senior Lecturer in Economics, London School of Economics, 1930–1945.

== Political career ==
Politically, Durbin defined himself as a 'militant Moderate'.

In [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931]] he was the unsuccessful Labour Parliamentary candidate for [[East Grinstead (UK Parliament constituency)|East Grinstead]], where Gaitskell spoke for him, addressing a meeting which included 'rowdy but good-natured Tory opposition',&lt;ref&gt;Gaitskell, H, Preface to "The Politics of Democratic Socialism" by Evan Durbin (Routledge, 1940)&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|1935]] he stood for [[Gillingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Gillingham, Kent]], where, in his selection speech, Durbin famously prioritised the preservation of political democracy over the pursuit of both socialism and peace.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|47}}

In early 1939 he joined with [[Douglas Jay, Baron Jay|Douglas Jay]] and Hugh Gaitskell in urging the Labour Party leadership to agree to the government's proposal for military conscription, so long as there was a ''quid pro quo'' in the form of '"conscription of wealth" (a wealth tax).&lt;ref&gt;McDermott, Geoffrey; "Leader Lost" Leslie Frewin (1972) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the Labour Party refused to support conscription at all. Once war was declared, Durbin was temporarily seconded to the Economic Section of the War Cabinet Secretariat, with other notable economists such as [[Lionel Robbins]] and the young [[Harold Wilson]],&lt;ref name="Pimlott"/&gt;{{rp|73}} 1940–1942 (during which time he penned ''The Politics of Democratic Socialism'', described by Professor David Marquand as consummating "[t]he marriage between Keynsianism and Fabianism"&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, David "The Progressive Dilemma" Phoenix Giant (1989) at p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;); and then was temporary Personal Assistant to [[Clement Attlee]], Deputy Prime Minister, 1942–1945.

Durbin was elected Labour MP for [[Edmonton (UK Parliament constituency)|Edmonton]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945]], and was amongst those invited to [[Hugh Dalton]]'s "Young Victors' Dinner", held at [[St Ermin's Hotel]], off Victoria Street SW1. As other guests included George Brown, [[Richard Crossman]], John Freeman, Hugh Gaitskell, Harold Wilson and [[Woodrow Wyatt]],&lt;ref name="Pimlott"/&gt;{{rp|93}} it is fairly clear that Durbin was regarded as a man of the future. He was Dalton's Parliamentary Private Secretary from 1945–47,&lt;ref name="Pimlott"/&gt;{{rp|95}} and started a ministerial career as Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Works, 1947–1948.

On 2 September 1948 Durbin drowned while rescuing one of his daughters from the sea at Strangles Beach, south of [[Bude]], on the coast of [[Cornwall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Austerity Britain, 1945–1951 |last=Kynaston |first=David |authorlink=David Kynaston |year=2007 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-7475-9923-4 |page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Writing in ''The Times'' after Durbin's death, Hugh Gaitskell paid tribute to Durbin's 'clarity of purpose' and 'well defined set of moral values and social ideals'. Gaitskell wrote that Durbin 'insisted in applying the process of reasoning unflinchingly and with complete intellectual integrity to all human problems' – including a consistent opposition to the dictatorship of Stalin, for 'he would not sentimentalise about tyranny, which seemed to him equally odious everywhere'. Gaitskell noted in his diary: "There is ... nobody else in my life whom I can consult on the most fundamental issues, knowing that I shall get the guidance I want".&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;{{rp|129}}

Despite his early death, Durbin continued to influence on Labour Party thinking throughout the 1950s, particularly for Gaitskell (who became party leader in 1955) and Labour revisionist [[Anthony Crosland]].

Durbin was also an influence on the founders of the [[Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) in 1981. For the SDP, Durbin's writing provided a model for a successful fight against the left within the Labour Party.

'''Filial mourning''' ({{zh|t=丁憂|s=丁忧|p=dīngyōu}}) refers to a bureaucratic norm, practiced since the [[Han dynasty]], whereby officials of the imperial government of China were obliged to resign their posts and return to their home upon the death of a parent or grandparent.

==Description==

The meaning of the phrase literally means 'to encounter worries/loss', i.e. bereavement. Once used to refer to all forms of mourning for one's parents, it evolved in meaning to refer only to the practice of officials resigning their posts for mourning.

The roots of the practice lie in the [[Confucianist]] focus on filial piety as a key virtue of government, and thus was instituted during the [[Western Han dynasty]], when Confucianism first became the official ideology of the empire. During the mourning period, banqueting, marriage, official activities and participation in the [[Imperial Examinations]] are all proscribed. The length of the mourning period is nominally three years, though in practice it has been described as being between twenty-five to twenty-seven months; this is also in line with Confucian prescriptions, since it takes three years for a human child to be fully weaned. At the end of the period, officials will be returned to the same rank as their last previously served post.

Nonetheless, given the length of the mandatory mourning and the tight restrictions on political or public activity, this practice often had a negative effect on the career of officials. Measures did exist to allow the government to recall an official in mourning; this is often applied to key officials in the bureaucracy, who are unable to leave their duties immediately as prescribed, or in times of emergency. On the other hand, failure to report a deceased parent and submit to filial mourning was an offence, and officials were liable to be impeached upon discovery.

Even the [[Chinese Emperor|Emperor]] was subjected to filial mourning, though his indispensability to administrative duties means he need only mourn for 27 days, instead of months.

'''George Turner Orton''' (January 19, 1837 &amp;ndash; November 14, 1901) was a physician and political figure in [[Ontario]], Canada. He represented [[Wellington Centre]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] from 1874 to 1887 as a [[Liberal-Conservative]].&lt;ref name="parl"&gt;{{Canadian Parliament links|ID=6774|nolist=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Guelph]], [[Upper Canada]],&lt;ref name="parl"/&gt; the son of Dr. Henry Orton, who came to [[Upper Canada]] from England, and Mary Jerram. He studied medicine at the College of Surgeons in [[Dublin]] and the [[University of St Andrews]] in [[Scotland]]. He graduated from the [[University of St Andrews School of Medicine]] with an M.D. in 1860. After practicing in [[England]], Orton returned to [[Ancaster, Ontario]] where he set up practice with his brother T.J. Orton, later moving to [[Fergus, Ontario|Fergus]]. He served as surgeon for the county militia.&lt;ref name="rose"&gt;[http://www.canadiana.org/ECO/mtq?doc=91595 ''A Cyclopæedia of Canadian biography being chiefly men of the time ...'', GM Rose (1886)]&lt;/ref&gt; Orton ran unsuccessfully for a federal seat in 1872.&lt;ref name="parl"/&gt; In 1883, he moved to [[Winnipeg]]. Orton was surgeon for a brigade which served during the [[North-West Rebellion]]. He also served as medical officer for the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and [[coroner]] for [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="rose"/&gt; Orton married Ann Farmer. He was defeated in a bid for reelection in 1887. Orton also served as reeve for Fergus.&lt;ref name="parl"/&gt; In 1888, he was named medical officer for the federal Department of Indian Affairs. He died in [[Winnipeg]] at the age of 64.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/people/orton_gt.shtml Biography, Manitoba Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

The community of [[Orton, Ontario]] was named in his honour.

===Cancer therapies===

Geron Corporation has sponsored human clinical trials of several anti-cancer products. 
* GRN163L (Imetelstat), is a drug that targets telomerase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Imetelstat Sodium|url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-drug?cdrid=447136|website=NCI Drug Dictionary|publisher=National Cancer Institute|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In studies conducted at [[Johns Hopkins University]], GRN163L was active against both CD138+ and CD138neg cancer stem cells and eliminated the colony forming potential of both by five weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brennan|first1=Sarah K.|last2=Wang|first2=Qiuju|last3=Tressler|first3=Robert|last4=Harley|first4=Calvin|last5=Go|first5=Ning|last6=Bassett|first6=Ekaterina|last7=Huff|first7=Carol Ann|last8=Jones|first8=Richard J.|last9=Matsui|first9=William|last10=Swarbrick|first10=Alexander|title=Telomerase Inhibition Targets Clonogenic Multiple Myeloma Cells through Telomere Length-Dependent and Independent Mechanisms|journal=PLoS ONE|date=1 September 2010|volume=5|issue=9|pages=e12487|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0012487|pmid=20824134|pmc=2931698}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, GRN163L inhibited the ''[[in vitro]]'' clonogenic growth of CD138neg Multiple Myeloma Cancer Stem Cells isolated from the bone marrow aspirates of patients with [[multiple myeloma]]. On November 3, 2014, the [[FDA]] removed the full clinical hold on imetelstat and declared the company's clinical development plan as acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/11/03/why-geron-corporation-shares-skyrocketed.aspx|title=Why Geron Corporation Shares Skyrocketed|date=November 3, 2014 |author=Alex Planes|work=The Motley Fool}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Geron exclusively licensed imetelstat to [[Janssen Biotech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fitzhugh|first1=Michael|title='New chapter' as Geron lands potential $935M imetelstat deal with Janssen|url=http://www.bioworld.com/content/new-chapter-geron-lands-potential-935m-imetelstat-deal-janssen-0|work=BioWorld|date=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This partnership was ended by Janssen on Sep 28th, 2018.

===Telomerase activation===

In addition to testing drug candidates that exploit cancer cell's dependence on telomerase, Geron is researching the possible applications of activating the enzyme in normal cells to delay cellular [[senescence]].  The company is in the early stages of developing a telomerase based treatment for [[HIV]] called TAT0002, which is the [[saponin]] [[cycloastragenol]] in Chinese herb [[Astragalus propinquus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/181/10/7400 TAT2 (cycloastragenol, CAS Registry no. 84605-18-5)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Geron has granted a license to Telomerase Activation Sciences to sell [[TA-65]], the telomerase activator agent also derived from [[astragalus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borrell|first1=Brendan|title=Lawsuit challenges anti-ageing claims|url=http://www.nature.com/news/lawsuit-challenges-anti-ageing-claims-1.11090|work=Nature|date=2 August 2012|pages=18–18|doi=10.1038/488018a}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010 Intertek/AAC Labs, an ISO 17025 internationally recognized lab, found the largest component of TA-65 to be Cycloastragenol.&lt;ref&gt;American Analytical Chemistry Laboratories Analysis Document #100710-236 of [http://www.CycloAstragenol.com/ TA-65]&lt;/ref&gt;

Geron originally investigated telomerase as a means of understanding and modifying human aging. However, Geron has ceased aging research of any kind.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Stem cell therapies===

On January 23, 2009, Geron received [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval to begin [[Clinical trial#Phase I|Phase I]] testing of GRNOPC1 in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/technology/2006/07/21/stem-cell-research-cz_kd_0721stemcell.html |work=Forbes |title=Despite Bush Veto, Stem Cell Research Abounds - Forbes.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204143010/http://www.forbes.com/technology/2006/07/21/stem-cell-research-cz_kd_0721stemcell.html |archivedate=February 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  GRNOPC1 is an embryonic stem cell based drug that is designed to treat specific forms of [[spinal cord injury]] through [[remyelination]] of damaged [[axon]]s.  This trial does not involve direct use of stem cells however, as GRNOPC1 is composed of [[oligodendrocyte]] progenitor cells derived from embryonic stem cell lines. Studies have shown significant restoration of mobility in animals with spinal injuries that received cells.&lt;ref name="pmid15888645"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Keirstead HS, Nistor G, Bernal G, etal |title=Human embryonic stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cell transplants remyelinate and restore locomotion after spinal cord injury |journal=J.

Geron also has several other embryonic [[stem cell treatments]] that are still in the preclinical phase, including GRNCM1, a treatment for [[heart disease]], and GRNIC1, a treatment for [[diabetes]].  In tests with diabetic mice, 80% of the mice given GRNIC1 were still alive in 50 days while the entire control group, which was given no treatment, perished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genengnews.com/news/bnitem.aspx?name=3153413 News: Geron Presents New Data That Document Progress in Development of Therapeutic Products from Human Embryonic Stem Cells.

Geron sold its human stem cell research assets to [[Asterias]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geron Announces Record Date for Distribution of Asterias Series A Common Stock|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/geron-announces-record-date-distribution-113101473.html|website=Yahoo Finance|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2010 and November 2010, One of Geron's most highly publicized trial therapy products has been GRNOPC1, a stem cell therapy designed to heal severe spinal cord injuries.  The cells in the GRNOPC1 therapy have been coaxed into becoming early [[myelinated]] [[glial cells]], a type of cell that insulates [[nerve cells]].  For every GRNOPC1 cell that is injected in the patient, they become six to 10 cells in a few months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pagingdrgupta.blogs.cnn.com/2010/10/11/first-human-injected-in-human-embryonic-stem-cell-trial/?replytocom=86296 CNN Rachel Meade Reports (October 13, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;
In Oct 2011 updated results on 4 patients were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scimitarequity.com/blog/2011/10/20/geron-gern-updates-clinical-data-from-grnopc1-spinal-cord-injury-trial/ |title=Geron (GERN) updates Clinical Data from GRNOPC1 Spinal Cord Injury Trial |date=20 Oct 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023052613/http://www.scimitarequity.com/blog/2011/10/20/geron-gern-updates-clinical-data-from-grnopc1-spinal-cord-injury-trial/ |archivedate=2011-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was discontinued in Nov 2011.

In early 2013 [[BioTime]], whose [[CEO]] is Geron founder [[Michael D. West]], acquired 400 patents and other intellectual property related to embryonic stem cells from Geron &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Geron's Stem Cell Program Sold|url= http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/37749/title/Geron-s-Stem-Cell-Program-Sold/ |work= The Scientist |date= October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= BioTime acquires stem cell assets from Geron, raises $10 million|url= http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/biotech/2013/01/biotime-acquires-stem-cell-assets-geron.html |work= San Francisco Business Times |date= January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later went on to restart the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Funding windfall rescues abandoned stem-cell trial|url= http://www.nature.com/news/funding-windfall-rescues-abandoned-stem-cell-trial-1.15350 |work= Nature |date= June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patent issues==
Geron Corporation initially held exclusive rights to three cell types derived from [[embryonic stem cell]]s, as the result of paying for the research originally conducted by [[James Thomson (cell biologist)|Dr. James Thomson]] at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Westhoff|first1=Julia|title=WARF, Geron reach settlement|url=http://badgerherald.com/news/2002/01/22/warf_geron_reach_set.php|work=The Badger Herald|date=22 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patents on the other three cell types are owned by the [[Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation]] (WARF). WARF and Geron did not charge academics to study human stem cells but did charge commercial users. In 2001 WARF came under public pressure to widen access to human stem-cell technology, and they launched legal action against Geron Corporation to recover some of the previously sold rights. The two sides agreed that Geron would keep the rights to only three cell types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Regalado|first1=Antonio|last2=Hamilton|first2=David P.|title=How a University's Patents May Limit Stem-Cell Research|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115319002102509489|work=Wall Street Journal|date=18 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, a legal challenge was mounted to overturn these patents by [[Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights|The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights]] and the non-profit patent-watchdog [[Public Patent Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kintisch|first1=E.|title=Groups Challenge Key Stem Cell Patents|journal=Science|date=21 July 2006|volume=313|issue=5785|pages=281–281|doi=10.1126/science.313.5785.281|lay-url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2006/07/groups-target-stem-cell-patents|lay-date=18 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contended that two of the patents granted to WARF are invalid because they cover a technique published in 1992 for which a patent had already been granted to an Australian researcher. Another part of the challenge came from the molecular biologist [[Jeanne Loring]] who stated that [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] stem cell pioneer [[James Thomson (cell biologist)|James Thomson]]'s techniques (currently patents held by WARF) are rendered obvious by a 1990 paper and two textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Loring|first1=Jeanne|title=A patent challenge for human embryonic stem cell research|url=http://www.nature.com/stemcells/2007/0711/071108/full/stemcells.2007.113.html|work=Nature Reports Stem Cells|date=8 November 2007|doi=10.1038/stemcells.2007.113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of this legal challenge was particularly relevant to the Geron Corporation as it can only license patents that are upheld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stem Cell Patents Come Under Fire|url=http://www.genetics-and-society.org/newsdisp.asp?id=1039|work=Center for Genetics and Society|agency=Associated Press|date=19 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patents were ultimately upheld when the reexamination concluded in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warf.org/news/news.jsp?news_id=234 WARF press release]&lt;/ref&gt;

As an interim measure, on January 23, 2007 WARF relaxed the stem cell patents, allowing industry-sponsored research at academic and non-profit institutions without a license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Somers|first1=Terri|title=Stem cell scientists shout out hallelujah|url=http://legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20070123/news_1b23stems.html|work=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=23 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; WARF will allow easier and simpler cost free cell transfers among researchers and would not require a license or agreement from California's taxpayer-funded stem cell research program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin Group Eases Stem Cell Patent Restrictions After FTCR|url=http://www.pubpat.org/warfstemcelleased.htm|website=PUBPAT|accessdate=5 September 2013|date=23 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
As a participant in the [[stem cell controversy|then-controversial]] stem cell and cloning area, Geron Corporation was asked to testify about its technology before the U.S. Congress.  In 2001, when Congress was attempting to ban all forms of cloning, then Geron [[chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Thomas Okarma]] spoke before Congress to preserve cloning for therapeutic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2001/04/05/0305cloning.html | work=Forbes | title=Geron's Cloning Quandary - Forbes.com | date=April 5, 2001| first=Matthew | last=Herper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_22/b3835716.htm |title=Online Extra: Thomas Okarma: Don't Ban Stem-Cell Research |date=2 June 2003 |work=BusinessWeek |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522210421/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_22/b3835716.htm |archive-date=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=House Hearing, 107th Congress - The Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001 and The Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001 |date=20 June 2001 |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-107hhrg73733/html/CHRG-107hhrg73733.htm |website=U.S. Government Publishing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''gift tax''' is a [[tax]] imposed on the [[Gift (law)|transfer]] of ownership of [[property]]. The United States [[Internal Revenue Service]] says, a gift is "Any transfer to an [[individual]], either directly or indirectly, where full compensation (measured in money or money's worth) is not received in return."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/frequently-asked-questions-on-gift-taxes Frequently Asked Questions on Gift Taxes, Internal Revenue Service]&lt;/ref&gt;

When a taxable gift in the form of cash, stocks, real estate, or other [[tangible]] or [[intangible property]] is made, the tax is usually imposed on the [[Donation|donor]] (the giver) unless there is a retention of an interest which delays completion of the gift.  A transfer is "completely gratuitous" when the donor receives nothing of value in exchange for the given property.  A transfer is "gratuitous in part" when the donor receives some value but the value of the property received by the donor is substantially less than the value of the property given by the donor.  In this case, the amount of the gift is the difference.

In the [[United States]], the [[gift tax]] is governed by Chapter 12, Subtitle B of the [[Internal Revenue Code]]. The tax is imposed by section 2501 of the Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|2501}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For the purposes of taxable income, courts have defined a "gift" as the proceeds from a "detached and disinterested generosity."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Commissioner v. Duberstein]]'', quoting ''Commissioner v. LoBue'', 351 U.S. 243 (1956).&lt;/ref&gt; Gifts are often given out of "affection, respect, admiration, charity or like impulses."&lt;ref&gt;''Duberstein'' at 285 (quoting ''[[Robertson v. United States]]'', 343 U.S. 711, 714 (1952)).&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, if an interest in property is transferred during the giver's lifetime (often called an [[inter vivos|inter vivos gift]]) then the gift or transfer would not be subject to the [[Estate tax (United States)|estate tax]]. In 1976, Congress unified the gift and estate taxes limiting the giver's ability to circumvent the estate tax by giving during his or her lifetime. Notwithstanding, there remain differences between estate and gift taxes; such as the effective tax rate, the amount of the credit available against tax, and the basis of the received property.

There are also types of gifts which will be included in a person's estate; such as certain gifts made within the three-year window before death and gifts in which the donor retains an interest, such as gifts of remainder interests that are not either ''qualified'' [[remainder trusts]] or charitable remainder trusts.  The remainder interest gift tax rules apply the gift tax on the entire value of the trust by assigning a zero value to the interest retained by the donor.

== Non-taxable gifts ==
Generally, the following gifts are not taxable gifts:&lt;ref&gt;

* Gifts that are not more than the annual exclusion for the calendar year (last raised to $15,000 per recipient for any one donor, beginning for 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2017/10/19/irs-announces-2018-estate-and-gift-tax-limits-11-2-million-per-couple/#46ce16d4a4b8|title=IRS Announces 2018 Estate and Gift Tax Limits|date=2017-10-19|accessdate=2018-03-21|work=Forbes|first=Ashlea|last=Ebeling}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* Gifts to a political organization for its use
* Gifts to charities
* Gifts to one's (US Citizen) spouse
* Tuition or medical expenses one pays directly to a medical or educational institution for someone. Donor must pay the expense directly. If donor writes a check to donee and donee then pays the expense, the gift may be subject to tax.

== Exemptions ==
There are two levels of exemption from the gift tax.  First, gifts of up to the annual exclusion ($14,000 per recipient in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/frequently-asked-questions-on-gift-taxes#5|title=Frequently Asked Questions on Gift Taxes|last=|first=|date=12 May 2016|website=IRS Small Business and Self-Employed Website|publisher=IRS.gov|access-date=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) incur no tax or filing requirement. By splitting their gifts, married couples can give up to twice this amount tax-free. Note that each giver and recipient pair has their own unique annual exclusion; a giver can give to any number of recipients and the exclusion is not affected by other gifts that recipient may have received from others.

Second, gifts in excess of the annual exclusion may still be tax-free up to the lifetime estate basic exclusion amount ($5,340,000 in 2014, $5,430,000 in 2015, $5,450,000 in 2016), although for estates over that amount such gifts might increase estate taxes. Taxpayers that expect to have a taxable estate may sometimes prefer to pay gift taxes as they occur, rather than saving them up as part of the estate.

Furthermore, transfers (whether by bequest, gift, or inheritance) in excess of $1 million may be subject to a [[generation-skipping transfer tax]] if certain other criteria are met.

==Non-residents==
{{See also|Estate tax in the United States#Non-residents}}
For gift tax purposes, the test is different in determining who is a [[non-resident alien]], compared to the one for income tax purposes (the inquiry centers around the decedent's domicile). This is a subjective test that looks primarily at intent. The test considers factors such as the length of stay in the United States; frequency of travel, size, and cost of home in the United States; location of family; participation in community activities; participation in U.S. business and ownership of assets in the United States; and voting. It is possible for a foreign citizen to be considered a U.S. resident for income tax purposes but not for gift tax purposes.

If a person is a non-resident alien for purposes of gift tax, taxation of gifts is determined in a different way. If the property is not located in the U.S., there is no gift tax. If it is [[intangible property]], such as shares in U.S. corporations and interests in partnerships or LLCs, there is no gift tax.

Non-resident alien donors are allowed the same annual gift tax exclusion as other taxpayers ($14,000 per year for 2013 through 2016&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;). Non-resident alien donors do not have a lifetime unified credit. Non-resident alien donors are subject to the same rate schedule for gift taxes.

U.S. citizens and residents must report gifts from a non-resident alien that are in excess of $100,000 on [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f3520.pdf Form 3520].

===Noncitizen spouse===
According to [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/2523 26 USC section 2523(i)], gifts to a non-U.S.-citizen spouse are not generally exempt from gift tax. Instead, they are exempt only up a specified amount foreseen by [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/2503#b 26 USC section 2503 (b)] (that is, up to $147,000 for 2015).

==U.S. Federal gift tax contrasted with U.S. Federal income tax treatment of gifts==

Pursuant to [[26 USC 102(c)]], the receipt of a gift, bequest, devise, or inheritance is not included in gross income. Thus, a taxpayer does not include the value of the gift when filing an income tax return. Although many items might appear to be gift, courts have held the most critical factor is the transferor's intent.&lt;ref&gt;''Bogardus v. Commissioner'', 302 U.S. 34, 43, 58 S.Ct. 61, 65, 82 L.Ed. 32 (1937).&lt;/ref&gt; The transferor must demonstrate a "detached and disinterested generosity" when giving the gift to exclude the value of the gift from the taxpayer's gross income.&lt;ref&gt;''Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. LoBue'', 352 U.S. 243, 246, 76 S.Ct. 800, 803, 100 L.Ed. 1142 (1956).&lt;/ref&gt; The courts have defined "gift" as proceeds from a "detached and disinterested generosity."&lt;ref&gt;''See''     {{ussc|name=Commissioner v. Duberstein|link=|volume=363|page=278|pin=|year=1960}} (quoting {{ussc|name=Commissioner v. LoBue|link=|volume=351|page=243|pin=|year=1956}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

"Gifts" received from employers that benefit employees are not excluded from taxation. {{uscsub|26|102|c}} clearly states employers cannot exclude as a gift anything transferred to an employee that benefits the employee. Consequently, an employer cannot "gift" an employee's salary to avoid taxation.

Gifts from certain parties will always be taxed for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. Under Internal Revenue Code section 102(c), gifts transferred by or for an employer to, or for the benefit of, an employee cannot be excluded from the gross income of the employee for Federal income tax purposes.  While there are some statutory exemptions under this rule for [[De minimis fringe benefit|de minimis fringe]] amounts, and for achievement awards, the general rule is the employee must report a "gift" from the employer as income for Federal income tax purposes. The foundation for the preceding rule is the presumption that employers do not give employees items of value out of "detached and disinterested generosity" due to the existing employment relationship.

Under Internal Revenue Code section 102(b)(1), income subsequently derived from any property received as a gift is not excludable from the income taxed to the recipient. In addition, under Internal Revenue Code section 102(b)(2), a donor may not circumvent this requirement by giving only the income and not the property itself to the recipient. Thus, a gift of income is always income to the recipient.  Permitting such an exclusion would allow the donor and the recipient to avoid paying taxes on the income received, a loophole Congress has chosen to eliminate.

==History==
The gift tax is a backstop to the [[Estate tax in the United States|United States estate tax]]. Without the gift tax, large estates could be reduced by simply giving the money away prior to death, and thus escape any potential estate tax. Gifts above the annual exemption amount act to reduce the lifetime gift tax exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairmark.com/begin/gifts.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Congress initially passed the gift tax in 1932 at a much lower rate than the estate tax, a full 25% under the estate tax rate, while also providing a $50,000 exemption, separate from the $50,000 exemption under estate tax.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Jeffrey A. "Ghosts of 1932", in ''Florida Tax Review'' (Vol 9, Number 10, 2010), p.913.&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits were clear: a $10,000,000 gift would be taxed only $2,300,000, effectively only 23.0%, well below the estate tax rate.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, pp.913-914.&lt;/ref&gt;

The intention was to rapidly generate revenue in the [[Great Depression]], effectively encouraging avoidance of the estate tax by doing so, while lawmakers at the same time publicly, and in both House and Senate, proclaimed the exact opposite objective.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, pp.912-913.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this was directly at the expense of state tax revenues, as well as of future federal tax revenues.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, p.914.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary beneficiaries were the wealthiest citizens, whom the estate tax was supposedly designed to target, since only they had enough money to freely make large gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, p.915.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the express intention.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, p.915 fn 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henri Feulard''' (1858–1897) was a leading French dermatologist of the nineteenth century.

==Life==
Henri Feulard was born in Paris on 20 May 1858. He trained as a physician in the hospitals of Paris, interning at the [[Hôpital Saint-Louis]], which at the time specialized in [[dermatology]] and [[venereology]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Wallach and Gérard Tilles, "Henri Feulard (1858–1897): The Life and Works of the Secretary of the First International Congress of Dermatology", ''International Journal of Dermatology'' 37 (June 1998), pp.&amp;nbsp;469–474.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, he became Professor [[Jean Alfred Fournier]]'s Chief of Clinic (a position in French teaching hospitals that meant being day-to-day head of a department nominally run by a professor), and helped found the dermatological library in the Hôpital Saint-Louis. He was appointed librarian in 1890, and the library was later renamed ''Bibliothèque Henri-Feulard – Centre de documentation dermatologique''.

Feulard was an organizer and the secretary of the first International Congress of Dermatology, held in Paris in August 1889. He also attended the second International Congress of Dermatology, in Vienna (1892), and the third, in London (1896). He published extensively on clinical dermatology, primarily in the ''Annales de Dermatologie et de Syphiligraphie'', of which he became editor-in-chief in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary in the ''St. Louis Medical and Surgical Journal'' 72-73 (1897), p.&amp;nbsp;326.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1892 Feulard also worked at the infirmary of the [[Prison Saint-Lazare]], a women's prison where monthly medical inspections of [[Prostitution in France#R.C3.A9glementation .28Regulation.29|registered prostitutes]] were carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Wallach and Gérard Tilles, "Henri Feulard (1858–1897): The Life and Works of the Secretary of the First International Congress of Dermatology", ''International Journal of Dermatology'' 37 (June 1998), pp.&amp;nbsp;469–474.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 4 May 1897 Dr Feulard, his wife, their ten-year-old daughter Germaine, and their maid Ernestine Moreau, attended the [[Bazar de la Charité]], a high-class annual charity bazaar in Paris. They were present when the building caught fire. The family became separated in the stampede. Dr Feulard re-entered the building in an attempt to save his daughter, but both perished, as did Ernestine Moreau. Mrs Feulard suffered burn injuries but survived.&lt;ref&gt;Comtesse D. de Beaurepaire de Louvagny, ''Les Martyrs de la charité'' (Paris, 1897), p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Feulard was buried together with his daughter in [[Montmartre Cemetery]], after a service in [[Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, Paris|Notre-Dame-de-Lorette]].&lt;ref&gt;"Les obsèques particulières", ''[[Le Matin (France)|Le Matin]]'', [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5570441/f1 9 May 1897]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3193">The '''Hindmarsh–Rose model''' of [[neuron]]al activity is aimed to study the [[Action potential|spiking]]-bursting behavior of the [[membrane potential]] observed in experiments made with a single neuron. The relevant variable is the membrane potential, ''x''(''t''), which is written in [[dimensionless unit]]s. There are two more variables, ''y''(''t'') and ''z''(''t''), which take into account the transport of ions across the membrane through the [[ion channel]]s. The transport of [[sodium]] and [[potassium]] ions is made through fast ion channels and its rate is measured by ''y''(''t''), which is called the spiking variable. The transport of other ions is made through slow channels, and is taken into account through ''z''(''t''), which is called the bursting variable. Then, the Hindmarsh–Rose model has the mathematical form of a system of three nonlinear [[ordinary differential equation]]s on the dimensionless dynamical variables ''x''(''t''), ''y''(''t''), and ''z''(''t''). They read:

[[Image:Simulation of hrose neuron.png|thumb|right|400px|Simulation of Hindmarsh–Rose neuron showing typical neuronal [[bursting]].]] 

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\frac{d x}{d t} &amp;= y+\phi(x)-z+I, \\
\frac{d y}{d t} &amp;= \psi(x)-y, \\
\frac{d z}{d t} &amp;= r[s(x-x_R)-z],
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\phi(x) &amp;= -a x^3+b x^2, \\
\psi(x) &amp;= c-d x^2. 
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

The model has eight parameters: ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''r'', ''s'', ''x&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''I''. It is common to fix some of them and let the others be control parameters. Usually the parameter ''I'', which means the current that enters the neuron, is taken as a control parameter. Other control parameters used often in the literature are ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', or ''r'', the first four modeling the working of the fast ion channels and the last one the slow ion channels, respectively. Frequently, the parameters held fixed are ''s'' = 4 and ''x&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' = -8/5. When ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' are fixed the values given are ''a'' = 1, ''b'' = 3, ''c'' = 1, and ''d'' = 5. The parameter ''r'' is something of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''I'' ranges between −10 and 10.

The third state equation:
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\frac{d z}{d t} &amp;= r[s(x-x_R)-z],\\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
allows a great variety of dynamic behaviors of the membrane potential, described by variable x, including unpredictable behavior, which is referred to as [[chaos theory|chaotic dynamics]]. This makes the Hindmarsh–Rose model relatively simple and provides a good qualitative description of the many different patterns that are observed empirically.

== Origin ==
The form that used to register a site with the [[Usenet]] [[map]]ping project, before [[Internet]] connectivity became commonplace for Usenet sites, included a field for [[longitude]] and [[latitude]], preferably to [[arcsecond|seconds-of-arc]] accuracy.  This was actually used for generating geographically-correct maps of [[Usenet]] links on a plotter; however, it became traditional to refer to this as one's [[ICBM]] address or missile address, and some people include it in their [[signature block|sig block]] with that name (but a real missile address would include target [[elevation#Geography|elevation]]).

A typical tag might read "ICBM Address: 36.8274040 N, 108.0204086 W".

== Modern use ==
Today, using the ICBM method of coordinates is one method of [[geotagging]] webpages or other online material.  Some projects parse ICBM address included in [[webpage]]s via [[meta tags]], which can then be used to map out sites added to its [[database]].

Web page uses of &lt;syntaxhighlight lang="html4strict" enclose="none"&gt;&lt;meta name="ICBM" content="12.345, 67.890"&gt;&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MetaExtensions|title=MetaExtensions|website=WHATWG Wiki|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; specify the same location as a [[Geo URI|geo:12.345,67.890]] URI.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14856">'''''In vitro'' compartmentalization''' ('''IVC''') is an [[emulsion]]-based technology that generates cell-like compartments ''[[in vitro]]''. These compartments are designed such that each contains no more than one [[gene]].  When the gene is [[transcription (biology)|transcribed]] and/or [[translation (biology)|translated]], its products ([[RNAs]] and/or [[protein]]s) become 'trapped' with the encoding gene inside the compartment. By coupling the [[genotype]] ([[DNA]]) and [[phenotype]] (RNA, protein), compartmentalization allows the selection and evolution of phenotype.

== History ==

In vitro compartmentalization method was first developed by Tawfik et al.&lt;ref&gt;Tawfik, D.S. and A.D. Griffiths, Man-made cell-like compartments for molecular evolution. Nat Biotechnol, 1998. 16(7): p. 652–6.
&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the idea that [[Darwinian]] evolution relies on the linkage of genotype to phenotype, Tawfik et al. designed aqueous compartments of water-in-oil (w/o) [[emulsions]] to mimic cellular compartments that can link [[genotype]] and [[phenotype]].  Emulsions of cell-like compartments were formed by adding ''in vitro'' [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]]/[[translation (biology)|translation]] reaction mixture to stirred mineral oil containing [[surfactants]]. The mean droplet diameter was measured to be 2.6&amp;nbsp;um by laser diffraction. As a proof of concept, Tawfik el al. designed an experiment that would transcribe and translate M. HaeIII gene in the presence of 107-fold excess of genes encoding another enzyme folA. 3’ of each gene is purposely designed to contain HaeIII R/M sequences, and when HaeIII methyltransferase was expressed from a M.HaeIII gene, it would methylate HaeIII R/M sequence and cause the gene to be resistant to restriction enzyme digestion. By selecting for DNA sequences that survive the endonuclease digestion, Tawfik el al. found there was enrichment for the M.HaeIII genes, i.e. 1000 fold in the first round of selection.

===Emulsion technology===

Water-in-oil (w/o) emulsions are created by mixing aqueous and oil phases with the help of surfactants. A typical IVC emulsion is formed by first generating oil-surfactant mixture by stirring, and then gradually adding the aqueous phase to the oil-surfactant mixture. For stable emulsion formation, a mixture of [[Hydrophilic-lipophilic balance|HLB]] (hydrophile-lipophile balance) and low HLB surfactants are needed.&lt;ref&gt;Rothe, A., R.N. Surjadi, and B.E. Power, Novel proteins in emulsions using ''in vitro'' compartmentalization. Trends Biotechnol, 2006. 24(12): p. 587-92.&lt;/ref&gt; Some combinations of surfactants used to generate oil-surfactant mixture are mineral oil / 0.5% Tween 80 / 4.5% Span 80 / sodium deoxycholate&lt;ref&gt;Tawfik, D.S. and A.D. Griffiths, Man-made cell-like compartments for molecular evolution. Nat Biotechnol, 1998. 16(7): p. 652-6.&lt;/ref&gt; and a more heat stable version, light mineral oil / 0.4% [[Tween 80]] / 4.5% Span 80 / 0.05% [[Triton X-100]].&lt;ref&gt;Ghadessy, F.J., J.L. Ong, and P. Holliger, Directed evolution of polymerase function by compartmentalized self-replication. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2001. 98(8): p. 4552-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The aqueous phase containing transcription and/or translation components is slowly added to the oil surfactants, and the formation of w/o is facilitated by homogenizing, stirring or using hand extruding device.

The emulsion quality can be determined by light [[microscopy]] and/or [[dynamic light scattering]] techniques. The emulsion is quite diverse, and greater [[homogenization (chemistry)|homogenization]] speeds helps to produce smaller droplets with narrower size distribution.  However, homogenization speeds has to be controlled, since speed over 13,500 r.p.m tends to result in a significant loss of enzyme activity on the level of transcription. The most widely used emulsion formation gives droplets with a mean diameter of 2-3μm, and an average volume of ~5 femtoliters, or 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; aqueous droplet per ml of emulsions.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, O.J., et al., Directed evolution by ''in vitro'' compartmentalization. Nat Methods, 2006. 3(7): p. 561-70.&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio of genes to droplets is designed such that most of the droplets contains no more than a single gene statistically.

===''In vitro'' transcription/translation ===
IVC enables the miniaturization of large-scale techniques that can now be done on the micro scale including coupled ''in vitro'' [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] (IVTT) experiments. Streamlining and integrating transcription and translation allows for fast and highly controllable experimental designs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castro-Roa|first=Daniel|last2=Zenkin|first2=Nikolay|title=Methodology for the analysis of transcription and translation in transcription-coupled-to-translation systems in vitro|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1046202315002509|journal=Methods|volume=86|pages=51–59|doi=10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.05.029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luke|first=C|title=Serpin production using rapid in vitro transcription/translation systems|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1046202303002111|journal=Methods|volume=32|issue=2|pages=191–198|doi=10.1016/s1046-2023(03)00211-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Theberge|first=Ashleigh B.|last2=Courtois|first2=Fabienne|last3=Schaerli|first3=Yolanda|last4=Fischlechner|first4=Martin|last5=Abell|first5=Chris|last6=Hollfelder|first6=Florian|last7=Huck|first7=Wilhelm T.

IVC has used bacterial cell, wheat germ and rabbit reticulocyte (RRL) extracts for transcription and translation. It is also possible to use bacterial reconstituted translation system such as PURE in which translation components are individually purified and later combined. When expressing eukaryote or complex proteins, it is desirable to use [[eukaryotic]] translation systems such as wheat germ extract or more superior alternative, RRL extract. In order to use RRL for transcription and translation, traditional emulsion formulation cannot be used as it abolishes translation. Instead, a novel emulsion formulation: 4% Abil EM90 / light mineral oil was developed and demonstrated to be functional in expressing [[luciferase]] and human [[telomerase]].&lt;ref&gt;Ghadessy, F.J. and P. Holliger, A novel emulsion mixture for ''in vitro'' compartmentalization of transcription and translation in the rabbit reticulocyte system. Protein Eng Des Sel, 2004. 17(3): p. 201-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breaking emulsion and coupling of genotype and phenotype ===

Once transcription and/or translation has completed in the droplets, emulsion will be broken by successive steps of removing mineral oil and surfactants to allow for subsequent selection. At this stage, it is crucial to have a method to ‘track’ each gene products to the encoding gene as they become free floating in a heterogeneous population of molecules. There are three major approaches to track down each phenotype to its genotype.&lt;ref&gt;Leemhuis, H., et al., New genotype-phenotype linkages for directed evolution of functional proteins. Curr Opin Struct Biol, 2005. 15(4): p. 472-8.&lt;/ref&gt;   The first method is to attach each DNA molecule with a [[biotin]] group and an additional coding sequence for [[streptavidin]] (STABLE display).&lt;ref&gt;Yonezawa, M., et al., DNA display of biologically active proteins for ''in vitro'' protein selection. J Biochem, 2004. 135(3): p. 285-8.&lt;/ref&gt; All the newly formed proteins/peptides will be in fusion with streptavidin molecules and bind to their biotinylated coding sequence. An improved version attached two biotin molecules to the ends of a DNA molecule to increase the [[avidity]] between DNA molecule and streptavidin-fused peptides, and used a low GC content synthetic streptavidin gene to increase efficiency and specificity during PCR amplification.&lt;ref&gt;Yonezawa, M., et al., DNA display for ''in vitro'' selection of diverse peptide libraries. Nucleic Acids Res, 2003. 31(19): p. e118.&lt;/ref&gt; The second method is to covalently link DNA and protein. Two strategies have been demonstrated. The first is to form M.HaeIII fusion proteins.&lt;ref&gt;Bertschinger, J. and D. Neri, Covalent DNA display as a novel tool for directed evolution of proteins ''in vitro''. Protein Eng Des Sel, 2004. 17(9): p. 699-707.&lt;/ref&gt; Each expressed protein/polypeptide will be in fusion with Hae III DNA methyltransferase domain, which is able to bind covalently to DNA fragments containing the sequence 5′-GGC*-3′, where C* is 5-fluoro-2 deoxycytidine. The second strategy is to use monomeric mutant of VirD2 enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;de Figueiredo, P., R.L. Roberts, and E.W. Nester, DARTs: A DNA-based ''in vitro'' polypeptide display technology. Proteomics, 2004. 4(10): p. 3128-40.&lt;/ref&gt; When a protein/peptide is expressed in fusion with Agrobacterium protein VirD2, it will bind to its DNA coding sequence that has a single-stranded overhang comprising VirD2 T-border recognition sequences. The third method is to link phenotype and genotype via beads.&lt;ref&gt;Nord, O., M. Uhlen, and P.A. Nygren, Microbead display of proteins by cell-free expression of anchored DNA. J Biotechnol, 2003. 106(1): p. 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The beads used will be coated with streptavidin to allow for the binding of biotinylated DNA, in addition, the beads will also display cognate binding partner to the [[affinity tag]] that will be expressed in fusion with the protein/peptide.

== Selection ==

Depending on the phenotype to be selected, difference selection strategies will be used. Selection strategy can be divided into three major categories: selection for binding, selection for catalysis and selection for regulation.&lt;ref name="Griffiths, A.D 2006. p. 395-402"&gt;Griffiths, A.D. and D.S. Tawfik, Miniaturising the laboratory in emulsion droplets. Trends Biotechnol, 2006. 24(9): p. 395-402.&lt;/ref&gt; The phenotype to be selected can range from RNA to peptide to protein. By selecting for binding, the most commonly evolved phenotypes are peptide/proteins that have selective affinity to a specific [[antibody]] or DNA molecule. An example is the selection of proteins that have affinity to [[zinc finger]] DNA by Sepp et al.&lt;ref&gt;Sepp, A. and Y. Choo, Cell-free selection of zinc finger DNA-binding proteins using ''in vitro'' compartmentalization. J Mol Biol, 2005. 354(2): p. 212-9.&lt;/ref&gt; By selecting for catalytic proteins/RNAs, new variants with novel or improved enzymatic property are usually isolated. For example, new [[ribozyme]] variants with trans-ligase activity were selected and exhibited multiple turnovers.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, M., K.E. Griswold, and A.D. Ellington, Direct selection of trans-acting ligase ribozymes by ''in vitro'' compartmentalization. Rna, 2005. 11(10): p. 1555-62.&lt;/ref&gt; By selecting for regulation, inhibitors of DNA nucleases can be selected, such as protein inhibitors of the Colicin E7 DNase.&lt;ref&gt;Bernath, K., S. Magdassi, and D.S. Tawfik, Directed evolution of protein inhibitors of DNA-nucleases by ''in vitro'' compartmentalization (IVC) and nano-droplet delivery. J Mol Biol, 2005. 345(5): p. 1015-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

Comparing to other ''in vitro'' display technologies, IVC has two major advantages. The first advantage is its ability to control reactions within the droplets. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic components can be delivered to each droplet in a step-wise fashion without compromising the chemical integrity of the droplet, and thus by controlling what to be added and when to be added, the reaction in each droplet is controlled. In addition, depending on the nature of the reaction to be carried out, the pH of each droplet can also be changed. More recently, photocaged substrates were used and their participation in a reaction was regulated by photo-activation.&lt;ref name="Griffiths, A.D 2006. p. 395-402"/&gt; The second advantage is that IVC allows the selection of catalytic molecules. As an example, Griffiths et al. was able to select for [[phosphotriesterase]] variants with higher K&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt; by detecting product formation and amount using anti-product antibody and [[flow cytometry]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, A.D. and D.S. Tawfik, Directed evolution of an extremely fast phosphotriesterase by IVC. EMBO J, 2003. 22(1): p. 24-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Abraham''' ([[floruit|''fl.'']] 1672 &amp;ndash; 1689) was a [[governor]] of the now abandoned [[Hudson's Bay Company]] settlement at [[Port Nelson, Manitoba|Port Nelson]] (or Fort Nelson) on [[Hudson Bay]], located in the northern part of the modern [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[Manitoba]].

==Biography==
Immediately after joining the HBC in 1672, Abraham was sent to Hudson Bay, where he served under Governor [[Charles Bayly]] until 1678.  In 1679, possibly as a result of Abraham's accusations of mismanagement, Bayly was recalled to [[London]] and replaced by [[John Nixon (HBC governor)|John Nixon]].  Abraham held the position of Nixon's [[second-in-command]] until 1681, when he was assigned to [[The Diligence]] under the command [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]] [[Nehemiah Walker]].

Ignoring Nixon's criticisms of him, the HBC promoted Abraham to Captain of ''The George'' in 1683 and set sail for Port Nelson, where a [[fort]] had been established the previous year by Governor [[John Bridgar]].  Upon his arrival, Abraham discovered that the HBC's post had been routed by [[Pierre Esprit Radisson]] and [[Médard des Groseilliers]], [[France|French]] agents competing with the HBC.  Due to this and the fact that Bridgar had been captured and taken to [[Quebec]] by Radisson and Des Groseilliers, Abraham assumed command of Port Nelson.  He spent the next winter contending with [[Jean-Baptiste Chouart]], Des Groseilliers's son, for control of the region.  Abraham decided to sail back to [[England]] in the spring of 1684, but returned to Port Nelson when he received a commission as governor from the HBC while en route.  During his first official weeks as governor [[York Factory, Manitoba|Fort York]] was constructed under the supervision of [[George Geyer]].  Also during this time, Abraham repulsed an attack carried out by [[Claude de Bermen de la Martinière]] of the French [[Compagnie du Nord|La Compagnie du Nord]].  The following winter saw minor skirmishes and increased tensions with the French.

In 1685, the HBC committee decided to replace Abraham with Governor Thomas Phipps because he had abandoned Port Nelson in 1684 before receiving word from England. He acted as Phipps deputy until 1688, when he was recalled. The HBC decided to do this for two reasons: they considered his opposition to the French in the winter of 1684-85 had been unjustified considering his stronger position and certain reports he had made lead them to believe that he was planning to mount an [[interloping]] expedition.  These fears did not prove unfounded when, in 1688, Abraham, along with [[John Outlaw (shipwright)|John Outlaw]], sailed ''The Mary'' to [[Hudson Bay]] intent on infringing upon the HBC's charter.  However, the expedition did not go as planned when ''The Mary'' was wrecked by ice in the [[Hudson Strait]].  Before the ship sank, her crew and supplies were rescued by [[John Marsh (HBC governor)|John Marsh]], who had been tasked by the HBC settle in [[Albany River]].  Despite the English and French crowns enjoying a rare peace, Marsh's colony clashed with the local French and Abraham was given up as a hostage.  At some point during his captivity, Abraham switched his allegiance and proceeded to prey upon English ships on the [[St. Lawrence River]] for the remainder of his life.

"'''Josh'''" is an episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' television show. It was first broadcast on March 6, 1998, during the fourth season.

==Opening narration==
{{cquote|''They say seeing is believing. But the true question is... what do you believe you’ve seen?''}}

==Plot==
Tabloid TV reporter Judy Warren ([[Kate Vernon]]) knows she's come across a big story when she sees the videotape shot by two tourists in a remote Alaskan park. The tape shows Josh Butler ([[Alex McArthur]]), a recluse who lives in a cabin near the park, bringing back to life a young girl who has died after a fall, a feat he accomplishes by generating a mysterious blue glow. But, she only discovers how big a story it is when her pursuit of the strange young man is cut short by a top-secret military unit that is also chasing him.

It seems that the blue glow sent out electromagnetic pulses that knocked out two satellites orbiting 20,000 miles above the Earth, and the Air Force wants to know what's going on. A battery of tests doesn't produce any answers, leaving the brass, led by Col. Roger Tennent and Major Samuel Harbeck, to debate whether Butler is an alien or an angel—someone to be dissected or to be worshipped. Warren doesn't know what Josh is either, but she knows she doesn't trust the soldiers to make the right choice. This prompts her to try to save the recluse. The episode ends with Josh ascending back to his home while Judy chooses to destroy this information rather than divulge it.

==Closing narration==
{{cquote|''Throughout history, the search for faith has led man to look to the stars and the heavens for answers. But only by looking into ourselves may we truly find it.''}}

'''Juanita Joan Nielsen''' (née Smith) (22 April 1937 – disappeared 4 July 1975) was an [[Australians|Australian]] [[publisher]], activist for urban conservation and community issues&amp;ndash;particularly anti-development campaigns&amp;ndash;and heiress. She disappeared in [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]], Sydney in early July, 1975. The people responsible for her disappearance have never been identified and no trace of her has ever been found.

== Personal life ==
Nielsen was born Juanita Joan Smith in [[New Lambton]], [[New South Wales]] to parents Neil Donovan Smith and Vilma Grace Smith (née Meares) (1905–1978). Her parents separated soon after her birth and she was raised by her mother at [[Killara]], [[Sydney]]. Her father, Neil was an English-born heir to the [[Mark Foy's]] retail fortune via his parents, John Joseph Smith (1862–1921), who was a Chairman and Managing Director of Mark Foy's Ltd, and his wife,  Kathleen Sophie Foy (1870–1919). Kathleen Smith was a sister of Mark Foy and Francis Foy.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Richard. [http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150556b.htm "Nielsen, Juanita Joan (1937–1975)"] Australian Dictionary of Biography, Online Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Nielsen was educated at [[Ravenswood School for Girls]], [[Gordon, New South Wales|Gordon]], [[Sydney]]. She worked at Mark Foy's from 1953 until she travelled abroad in 1959. In 1962, she married a Danish seaman named Jorgen Fritz Nielsen at [[Kobe]], [[Japan]] although the marriage only lasted for a few years. Nielsen returned to Sydney in 1965 and returned to work at Mark Foy's for about five years.

In the early 1970s, she was the publisher of ''NOW'', an alternative newspaper in the [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]]. She lived in a terrace house at 202 Victoria Street (now heritage-listed as [[Juanita Nielsen's House]]),&lt;ref name=heritage-20-vict-st&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=5061009 |title=Juanita Nielsen's House (draft)  |publisher=Environment.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she became involved in a campaign against a proposed development project in her street and across the suburb.

Nielsen disappeared on 4 July 1975 and it is generally believed that she was [[kidnap]]ped and [[murder]]ed because of her anti-development and anti-corruption stances. A [[inquest|coronial inquest]] determined that Nielsen had been murdered, and although the case has never been officially solved, it is widely believed that Nielsen was killed by agents of the developers. The circumstances of her disappearance were fictionalised in the films [[Heatwave (film)|''Heatwave'']] and ''[[The Killing of Angel Street]]''.

==Victoria Point development==
In the early 1970s, property developer Frank Theeman (1913–1989) planned to construct a [[A$]]40 million apartment complex in Kings Cross. Theeman, who had initially made his fortune in lingerie, moved into property development in 1972 after he sold his ''Osti'' company to [[Dunlop Australia|Dunlop]] for A$3.5 million.

The plan involved evicting dozens of people from their houses in [[Victoria Street, East Sydney|Victoria Street]], an area which the [[National Trust of Australia|National Trust]] compared to [[Montmartre]] in [[Paris]]. Built along a steep sandstone escarpment east of the city centre and lined with rows of large 19th-century [[terrace house]]s, Victoria Street had commanding views of the city, the harbour and [[The Domain]].

The houses were to be demolished and replaced with three high-rise apartment towers. The local community campaigned against the development, and successfully lobbied the [[Builders Labourers' Federation]] (BLF) to impose a [[green ban]] on the site in 1972. Supported by the BLF, the residents of Victoria Street, including Nielsen, refused to leave their houses. Nielsen used her newspaper, ''NOW'', to publicise the issue.

In July 1973, resident Arthur King was kidnapped by two unidentified men, who put him in the [[trunk (automobile)|boot]] of their car. King was then driven to a [[motel]] on the [[South Coast, New South Wales|South Coast]] of New South Wales and held for three days before being released under threat of death. King quit as the head of the residents' action group, and immediately moved out of Kings Cross. It was suspected, though never proved, that the men had been hired by Theeman.

Other residents of the street were regularly harassed by men employed by Theeman, as he attempted to have them evicted from their houses. The men were led by [[Fred Krahe]], a former detective with the [[New South Wales Police]]. Krahe had been sacked amidst allegations of organising bank robberies and he was suspected of murdering whistleblower and prostitute [[Shirley Brifman]]&lt;ref name=hickie-284&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Hickie |title=The Prince and the Premier: The story of Perce Galea, Bob Askin and the others who gave organised crime its start in Australia |publisher=Angus &amp; Robertson |location=Sydney |year=1985 |page=284 |isbn=978-0207151538 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other Sydney crime figures.

Police officers did not intervene as Krahe's men worked. Residents would move into each other's houses so that no house was left unattended. On one occasion, when merchant seaman and jazz musician [[Mick Fowler]] returned from a period working at sea, he found that his house had been broken into, and all of his belongings taken. Fowler fought a protracted court battle to stay in his home but the strain of the struggle reputedly led to his early death in 1979, aged 50.

Eventually the green ban was broken in 1974 when the conservative federal leadership of the BLF, under pressure from New South Wales politicians, dismissed the leaders of the [[New South Wales]] branch, and replaced them with more conservative people. Nielsen and the residents were left as the only significant opposition to Theeman. Nielsen then convinced the Water Board Union to impose their own green ban. By early 1975, Theeman's company had spent about [[A$]]6 million (about A$37 million {{As of|2011|alt=in 2011 money}}) purchasing property in Kings Cross, and [[interest]] payments on loans were costing about A$3,000 a day.

== Disappearance ==
[[File:JuanitaNielsen1.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Juanita Nielsen memorial, South Head Cemetery, [[Vaucluse, New South Wales]]]]
On 4 July 1975, Nielsen, 38, went to the Carousel Club in Kings Cross in order to discuss advertising for the club in Nielsen's newspaper, ''NOW''. She had been invited there by Edward Trigg, an employee of the club. The club was one of a number of bars and strip clubs owned by [[Abe Saffron]], who was a major figure in Sydney [[organised crime]], and it was managed by James Anderson, who, as a later investigation revealed, owed [[A$]]260,000 (about A$1.6 million {{As of|2011|alt=in 2011 money}}) to Frank Theeman, and according to a 2008 book by Saffron's son Alan, Abe Saffron lent large sums of money to several prominent Sydney businessmen including Theeman.

Before June 1975 the Carousel had no connection with Nielsen or ''NOW'', but that month Anderson initiated contact by sending Nielsen an invitation to attend a press night at the club on 13 June. According to the ''Sydney Morning Herald'', she would not normally have been invited because ''NOW'' did not give free publicity to commercial ventures. In the event, Nielsen did not attend and both Trigg and the Carousel's receptionist Loretta Crawford have claimed that Anderson was "furious" about her non-appearance.

A few days later Trigg instructed the Carousel's PR man Lloyd Marshall to invite Nielsen to a meeting at the Camperdown Travelodge, supposedly to discuss advertising related to landscaping, but Nielsen's boyfriend later recounted that Nielsen became suspicious and refused to attend.

On 30 June, four days before the Carousel appointment, Trigg and another man, Carousel barman Shayne Martin-Simmonds, phoned Nielsen's house on the pretext of inquiring about advertising the Carousel's businessmen's lunches in ''NOW''. It was later claimed that Trigg and Martin-Simmonds intended to seize Nielsen when she opened the door, but their plan was foiled when her friend David Farrell answered the door instead. The two men played out their cover story, but Nielsen was listening in an adjoining room and after they left she complimented Farrell on his handling of the query, teasing him by saying she might send him out on the road to sell advertising in ''NOW''.

When interviewed by police on 6 November 1977, Martin-Simmonds confirmed that the advertising story was a ruse and that their actual intention was to kidnap Nielsen if she was alone and take her to see "people who wanted to talk to her". He said that he and Trigg intended to:

:"... Just grab her arms and stop her calling out, no real rough stuff, no gangster stuff. We thought that just two guys telling her to come would be enough to make her think if she didn't come she might get hurt ... we talked about when she came into the room, one of us would be standing there and the other one would come up behind her and just quietly grab her by the arms and maybe put a hand over her mouth or a pillowslip over the head."

According to her friend David Farrell, Nielsen was by then seriously concerned that her activism was putting her in danger. She mentioned her fears to Farrell about two weeks before her disappearance and she arranged to keep him regularly informed of her whereabouts.

Receptionist Loretta Crawford claims that Trigg instructed her to call Nielsen on the night of Thursday 3 July to set up a meeting at the club for the following morning. Crawford now claims that she knew that the advertising story was "bullshit", since the club did not advertise in "local rags", that she was doubtful that Nielsen would attend, and that she was surprised that Nielsen kept the appointment.

At 10:30am on Friday 4 July, Nielsen telephoned David Farrell to tell him that she was running late for the meeting. According to Crawford, when Nielsen arrived she proceeded to the landing on the first floor where Crawford's reception desk was located. Crawford offered her a seat and a cup of coffee, after Nielsen remarked that she had had a "hard night" (i.e. she was hung over), but that Nielsen didn't get to drink the coffee because Trigg arrived. Crawford said that she noted that he was on time, which she thought unusual since he was often late. He and Nielsen exchanged greetings on the landing and went upstairs to Trigg's office.

At this point in her account, given to the ''Sydney Morning Herald'' in 2001, Crawford made a new claim: that she then made a phone call to Jim Anderson at his home in [[Vaucluse, New South Wales|Vaucluse]], told him that Nielsen had arrived and that he was "quite pleased" by the news. Crawford was adamant that she was, in no doubt whatsoever, certain that Anderson was at his home in Vaucluse—not in [[Surfers Paradise, Queensland]], as he has always claimed.

In statements given to police, Trigg and Crawford said that Nielsen had left the club alone, although in 1976 Crawford changed her story to say that Nielsen and Trigg left together. Nielsen was not seen again. Her handbag and other effects were discovered on 12 July, abandoned near a freeway in Sydney's western suburbs.

[[New Zealand]] born [[transvestite]] Marilyn King (also known as Monet King), the former girlfriend of Trigg, told one journalist that Trigg had returned home on 4 July with blood on his clothes. A piece of paper in his pocket, which was later used by police as evidence before the coronial inquest, also had blood on it. This was supposedly a receipt signed by Nielsen for advertising money paid by Trigg. King said that Trigg threw out the shirt, and the portion of the paper with blood on it. King never gave testimony to the police or the coronial inquiry.

In late 1977, Trigg and two other employees at the ''Carousel Club'' were arrested and charged with [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiring]] to kidnap Nielsen. Trigg was [[prison|imprisoned]] for three years, one other man was imprisoned for two years and the third was [[acquittal|acquitted]]. However, it was still unclear what had actually happened to Nielsen. After the death of James Anderson in 2003,&lt;ref name=smh-anderson-dead&gt;Neil Mercer. [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/21/1058639728843.html "To the end, 'Big Jim' insisted it was all lies"] www.smh.com.au. 22 July 2003. Retrieved 21 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford changed her story again. She claimed that she had seen Nielsen's body in the storeroom below the club, with Trigg and two other men standing over her. She saw that one of the men was holding a gun, and Nielsen's body had a small bullet wound.

Nielsen's body has never been found.

The obvious motive for Nielsen's presumed murder was her opposition to the Victoria Street development. However, there have also been claims that she was working on an exposé about vice, corruption and illegal gambling in the Cross. Her then boyfriend John Glebe gave evidence that Nielsen had told him about receiving telephone threats and he also testified that she carried cassette tapes in her handbag. According to Glebe, Nielsen had told him that the tapes could "blow the top off" an issue she was working on. An article in ''[[The Bulletin]]'' in 2005 ran claims by journalist Barry Ward that Nielsen had been given dossiers on "prominent Sydney identities" by private detective Allan Honeysett, and speculated that these documents would reputedly have exposed the principals involved in Sydney's illegal gaming industry.

In 2004 ABC-TV's ''The 7:30 Report'' broadcast a new interview with Loretta Crawford, who had been the receptionist at the Carousel Club at time of Nielsen's disappearance. Speaking with journalist Emma Alberici, Crawford claimed her previous testimony regarding Nielsen was false and had been concocted to protect her former boss, James Anderson, but that Anderson's recent death meant she was now free to reveal the truth. Crawford's new claim was that Nielsen had indeed been killed in the basement of the club in the presence of Trigg and Martin-Simmonds, that she had seen Nielsen's body on the floor, bearing a single small gunshot wound, and that she saw a third man, whom she did not name, standing over Nielsen's body, holding a pistol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2004/s1046350.htm |title=The Juanita Nielsen Mystery |work=7:30 Report |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=16 February 2004 |accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013 ''The Australian'' newspaper reported that, prior to his death in February 2013,&lt;ref name=smh-trigg-dead&gt;Neil Mercer. [http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/trigg-takes-truth-behind-murder-to-grave-20130302-2fczk.html "Trigg takes truth behind murder to grave"] www.smh.com.au. 3 March 2013. Retrieved 21 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Trigg had written a "deathbed" manuscript which allegedly revealed the true facts of Trigg's involvement in the Nielsen case, that it "named names" of those involved in the Nielsen conspiracy, and that it revealed the resting place of Nielsen's remains.&lt;ref name=aus-hands/&gt; NSW police spokesperson confirmed that police from Redfern Local Area Command had searched Trigg's residence after his death, but they refused to comment on the outcome. An unnamed friend of Trigg's (a retired Kings Cross bouncer) told reporter Ean Higgins that the police visited Trigg's hotel room twice after his death:

:"The cops came here on Sunday after he died, then they came back today (Tuesday) and spent half a day going through his room, taking the place apart, looking for the book. But Eddie was too smart, he didn't leave anything, and it's all with his lawyer. His son and his nephew have been told."

A coronial inquiry with a [[jury]] was held in 1983, which determined that Nielsen had probably been killed, although there was not enough evidence to show how she died or who killed her. The inquest did note that [[police corruption]] may have crippled the investigation into her death at the time.

A Joint Committee of the Commonwealth [[Parliament of Australia]] was formed in 1994 to further investigate her disappearance. It also concluded that corruption impeded the police investigation. She was declared as deceased by an inquest.

===Suspects===
Although it has never been established who killed Nielsen, there are several major suspects in the conspiracy to silence her.

* '''Frank Theeman''', the 'Victoria Point' developer, was considered by a number of journalists to be the prime suspect in the conspiracy to silence Nielsen. The costly delays to his development offer a highly plausible motive for Theeman wanting to get Nielsen 'out of the way'. Although no direct evidence has been uncovered conclusively linking Theeman to the presumed murder, there is clear circumstantial evidence of business links between the three main suspects, Theeman, Saffron and Anderson.
* '''[[Abe Saffron]]''', who owned and operated several 'businesses' in Kings Cross, had numerous circumstantial connections with the case. Throughout his life Saffron (often dubbed "the Boss of the Cross" or "Mr Sin") was accused of having masterminded a wide range of criminal activities including gambling, prostitution, drug dealing and "sly grog" sales, and to have co-ordinated a network of bribery and official corruption that (according to his son Alan) included former New South Wales Premier [[Robert Askin]] and Police Commissioner [[Norman Allan]]. Although no evidence has yet surfaced to reliably link Saffron to Nielsen's disappearance, there are significant circumstantial connections—Saffron owned the Carousel club, where Nielsen was last seen, Saffron associate (and Carousel manager) Jim Anderson reportedly borrowed large sums from Frank Theeman, and Alan Saffron's 2008 book about his father claims that Theeman was one of several prominent Sydney business identities to whom Saffron lent money through a [[loan sharking]] operation, a claim which links to earlier reports that Theeman had tried to borrow money from Saffron to cover his 'loans' to Jim Anderson. Also, as well as her campaign against Theeman's development, Nielsen was also reportedly investigating vice and corruption in Kings Cross.
* '''James Anderson''' has long been considered a prime suspect, although he protested his innocence right up until his death in 2003, and the recent book by Alan Saffron supports the allegations that Anderson organised Nielsen's abduction. Like his boss Abe Saffron, Anderson's circumstantial connections to the Nielsen case are numerous: he reportedly borrowed a considerable sum of money from Theeman; he had business links to both Theeman and Theeman's "drug troubled" son, and he was a known associate of the three men charged with conspiring to kidnap Nielsen. Anderson always insisted that he was in [[Surfers Paradise, Queensland]] with another person on the day of Nielsen's disappearance, and that he flew there with another man on 4 July and stayed for about three days in a room booked in his wife's name at the Chevron Hotel. However, Loretta Crawford later claimed that Anderson was at his home in the eastern Sydney suburb of [[Vaucluse, New South Wales|Vaucluse]] that day and that she spoke to him by telephone. Police did not fully investigate Anderson's [[alibi]], and they only determined that his car, which was left at [[Sydney Airport]], had received two parking tickets. Police reportedly failed to contact the man that Anderson claimed had accompanied him to Surfers Paradise, nor did they verify whether Anderson actually flew there on that day or checked into the hotel.
* '''Det. Sgt [[Fred Krahe]]''', the former detective, has been named on several occasions by investigative journalists and experts on the case as Juanita's killer. He was a regular customer at the ''Venus Room'', a nightclub owned by [[Abe Saffron]], who also owned the ''Carousel Club'', and it has been repeatedly alleged that Krahe organised the "heavies" hired by the developers to intimidate stubborn residents and force them out. The 1994 parliamentary Joint Committee identified Anderson and Krahe as significant suspects in Nielsen's disappearance. Alleged hit-man ''James Bazely'' named Krahe as the killer of [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] anti-drugs campaigner [[Donald Mackay (anti-drugs campaigner)|Donald Mackay]], and it has also been claimed that another allegedly corrupt detective, Supt. Don Fergusson, who was reported to have killed himself with his service pistol in the toilets at police headquarters, had in fact been executed by Krahe.

'''King Pharmaceuticals''', is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Pfizer]] based in [[Bristol, Tennessee]]. Before being acquired by Pfizer, it was the world's 39th largest [[pharmaceutical company]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kingpharm.com/default_king.htm Untitled Document&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kingpharm.com/fast_facts.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pharmexec.findpharma.com/pharmexec/data/articlestandard//pharmexec/512007/480240/article.pdf Pharmaceutical Executive - 2006 Top 50 Pharmaceutical Companies]&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 12, 2010, King was acquired by [[Pfizer]] for $14.25 per share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/10/12/pfizer-to-buy-king-pharmaceuticals-for-3-6-billion/ | work=The New York Times | title=Pfizer to Buy King Pharmaceuticals for $3.6 Billion | date=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; King produced a wide range of [[pharmaceutical]]s, including [[Ramipril|Altace]] for [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] prevention, [[Levothyroxine|Levoxyl]] for [[hypothyroidism]], [[Zaleplon|Sonata]], a [[Sedative|sleeping aid]],  and [[Metaxalone|Skelaxin]], a [[muscle relaxant]].  King Pharmaceuticals operated manufacturing facilities in [[Bristol, Tennessee]]; [[Rochester, Michigan]]; [[St. Louis, Missouri]]; [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]; and [[Middleton, Wisconsin]]. They employed approximately 2,700 people including a sales force of over 1,000 individuals.

King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Tennessee in 1993. According to the King Pharmaceutcals, Inc. Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the wholly owned subsidiaries of King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are Monarch Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; King Pharmaceuticals Research and Development, Inc.; Meridian Medical Technologies, Inc.; Parkedale Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; King Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc.; and Monarch Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=King Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

==Company history==
King Pharmaceuticals was founded in 1993 [[John M. Gregory (businessman)|John M. Gregory]], [[Randal J. Kirk]], Joseph "Joe" R. Gregory, Jefferson "Jeff" J. Gregory, and James E. Gregory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/King-Pharmaceuticals-Inc-Company-History.html King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Company History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20030201091134/http://www.kingpharm.com/chairman.htm King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Message From Our Chairman.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1994, King acquired a former [[King University|King College]] campus plant in Bristol, Tennessee. The {{convert|500000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility was purchased for $1.18 million from RSR Pharmaceutical, who had been using it after Beecham merged with [[SmithKline]].  King initially manufactured drugs for other pharmaceutical companies, but soon established a strategy of acquiring branded prescription drugs, which have a much higher gross margin than contract manufactured drugs.

In February 1998, King acquired 15 branded pharmaceuticals, a sterile products manufacturing facility located in Rochester, Michigan that it called the "Parkedale Facility") and some contract manufacturing contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=King Pharmaceuticals, Amendment 8 to Form S-1|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=680633|publisher=NASDAQ|date=June 2, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By December 1998 King had placed its sterile products business into a subsidiary it named Parkedale Pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: King Pharmaceuticals and Hoechst Marion Roussel Sign an Agreement for One Of The Largest Single Product Transactions in Emerging Pharmaceutical Sector {{!}} Evaluate|url=http://www.evaluategroup.com/Universal/View.aspx?type=Story&amp;id=173748|publisher=King, via Evaluate|date=December 18, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King Pharmaceuticals obtained about twenty smaller branded drugs from the start up of the company until it went public in June 1998. The King Pharmaceuticals subsidiary Monarch Pharmaceuticals acquired one of its most profitable branded drugs, Altace, later the same year on December 18, 1998 from [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst Marion Roussel]].

==U.S. marketing and distribution rights to Altace™==

During 1994, the U.S. [[National Right to Life Committee]] announced an anti-[[RU-486]] [[boycott]], targeting all Hoechst pharmaceutical products including [[Altace]]™. By September 17, the [[pro-life]] organization Pharmacists For Life International joined the NRLC anti-RU-486 boycott "...against the American subsidiary of Hoechst, AG Hoechst-Roussel, Hoechst-Celanese, its generic subsidiary Copley Pharmaceuticals and the agricultural Hoechst subsidiary"&lt;ref name="pln-0419"&gt;[http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/ProLife.News/1994/pln-0419.txt "3) Pharmacists For Life Joins International Boycott"]. Life Communications. November, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; while asking U.S. consumers to "...focus on key Hoechst drugs which have the most economic impact rather than taking an across-the-board shotgun approach"&lt;ref name="pln-0419"/&gt; and specifically targeting Altace as a boycott list item.&lt;ref name="pln-0419"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20080220223236/http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1994/vp940708/07080818.htm "Abortion Foes To Boycott Drugs (Altace) Made By RU-486 Manufacturer"]. ''The Virginia-Pilot''. Associated Press. July 8, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoechst merged with Marion Merrill Dow of Kansas City, Missouri in 1995, forming the Hoechst U.S. pharmaceutical subsidiary Hoechst Marion Roussel (HMR). Altace was bringing in under $90 million in U.S. revenues for HMR and Hoechst had stopped promoting Altace within the United States.,&lt;ref name="136_print"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080403070806/http://www.forbesimg.com/forbes/2002/1028/136_print.html "Faith Healers: The born-again Gregory brothers worked a financial miracle from cast-off drug brands"]. Forbes. Zina Moukheiber. October 28, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and King Pharmaceuticals President Jefferson "Jeff" Gregory also began negotiations in 1995 with Hoechst to acquire U.S. distribution rights to Altace.&lt;ref name="136_print"/&gt;

The King Pharmaceuticals wholly owned subsidiary Monarch Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (another brother of John Gregory - Joseph Gregory - was then the president of Monarch Pharmaceuticals) acquired ownership of the U.S. distribution and marketing rights to Altace and other Hoescht products from Hoescht AG subsidiary Hoechst Marion Roussel of Kansas City, Missouri on December 18, 1998, and&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.custservices.com/news.asp?up=8 "Monarch Pharmaceuticals acquired"]. sanofi-aventis Group. December 18, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; following a January 1999 merger a few weeks later with [[Rhône-Poulenc]], Hoechst assumed the new corporate identity of [[Aventis]]).

In 2001, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine ranked John Gregory among the 400 richest Americans. The bulk of Gregory's personal fortune was due in large part due to the ability of King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to reintroduce the Hoechst branded prescription drug Altace back into the U.S. market under the King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. subsidiary Monarch Pharmaceuticals brand following the 1998 U.S. marketing and distribution agreement between King Pharmaceuticals/Monarch Pharmaceuticals and AG Hoechst/HMR.

In late December 1998, King Pharmaceuticals (d.b.a. Monarch Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) purchased the U.S. marketing and distribution rights of the company's most successful drug, Altace, for $362.5 million from the U.S. subsidiary of [[Hoechst AG]], Hoechst Marion Roussel of Kansas City.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.twst.com/notes/articles/jab202.html "King Pharmaceuticals CEO focuses on patented products".&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of increasing the number of sales representatives and the findings of the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation ([http://www.chd-taskforce.com/pdf/sk_hope.pdf HOPE]), Altace sales skyrocketed. Using profits from Altace, King continued to add product lines, the most significant purchases being [[Levoxyl]], [[Thrombin]], and [[Cytomel]] in 2000.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Also in 2000, seeing fewer opportunities to obtain branded drugs, the company acquired an R&amp;D company based in North Carolina.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} In 2002, King and [[Meridian Medical Technologies Inc.]] agreed that King would purchase Merdian for $247.8 million in cash; Meridian was a manufacturer of autoinjectors, including EpiPen, an [[epinephrine autoinjector]].&lt;ref&gt;King Pharmaceuticals Oct 21, 2002. [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/king-pharmaceuticals-to-acquire-meridian-medical-technologies-76364227.html Press Release: King Pharmaceuticals to Acquire Meridian Medical Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt;  The deal was completed in January 2003.&lt;ref&gt;King Pharmaceuticals [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1047699/000095014404006620/g89681e11vk.htm Form 11K] filed For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, John Gregory stepped down as CEO, and his brother Jefferson Gregory took over. Then in 2004, Jeff Gregory stepped down as well after the SEC began investigations into King’s Medicaid billing practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestreet.com/_tsclsii/stocks/robertsteyer/10144369.html TheStreet.com : King Pharmaceuticals CEO to Step Down | Robert Steyer | KG&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The board named Brian Markison to replace him. Soon after, in July 2004, a deal was made for [[Mylan Laboratories]] to acquire King for $4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB109079748272873376?mod=googlewsj | work=The Wall Street Journal | first1=Leila | last1=Abboud | first2=Dennis K. | last2=Berman | title=Mylan to Buy King Pharmaceuticals | date=July 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investors, most notably [[Carl Icahn]], were critical of the merger, saying that Mylan was overpaying for King. The next year the deal was called off.

In 2008 King Pharmaceuticals acquired Alpharma Pharmaceuticals to expand into the pain treatment market.  From the acquisition, King gained the patents on the pain management drugs, Flector and Embeda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dddmag.com/news-King-Pharmaceuticals-Acquires-Alpharma.aspx King Pharmaceuticals Acquires Alpharma]  They also gained a completely separate animal health division, which focuses on the many agricultural and animal health needs of livestock animals.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acquisition ==

On October 12, 2010, [[Pfizer]] Inc. ({{NYSE|PFE}}) announced it would acquire Bristol-based King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for a total cost to Pfizer of $3.6 billion in cash or $14.25 per share. The acquisition was expected to expand Pfizer's product line of pain relief and management medication by adding King products such as Embeda, Avinza, and the Flector Patch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kingpharm.com/Investors/News_Details.cfm?news_item_id=564 Pfizer to Acquire King Pharmaceuticals, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; Other product lines that made King attractive to Pfizer included the [[EpiPen]] for emergency delivery of medications and the Alpharma animal health line.&lt;ref name=PfizerMarch2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pfizer.com/news/press_releases/pfizer_press_release_archive.jsp?guid=20110301006102en&amp;source=2011&amp;page=14 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130630050306/http://www.pfizer.com/news/press_releases/pfizer_press_release_archive.jsp?guid=20110301006102en&amp;source=2011&amp;page=14 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 30, 2013 |title=Pfizer Completes Acquisition Of King Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Pfizer and King begin joint operations on March 1, 2011 |date=March 1, 2011 |publisher=Pfizer |type=press release }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1284">In '''''Kirsten v Bailey''''', an important case in the [[South African law of succession]], a [[testatrix]] made three [[Will and testament|wills]]. In the first and third, Bailey was nominated as the sole [[beneficiary]] of her [[estate (law)|estate]]; in the second will, Kirsten was nominated as the sole beneficiary. Kirsten [[Will contest|challenged]] the validity of the third will.

The [[court of law|court]] held that Bailey had led the testatrix to believe that he would leave her unless she appointed him her sole [[heir]]. Thus, Kirsten had proved that the testatrix was [[duress|unduly influenced]], and accordingly lacked the requisite capacity. The testatrix therefore was held to have died [[intestate]].

The effect of the [[court ruling|ruling]] is that if a court declares the last in a series of wills to be invalid ''ab initio'', the deceased is deemed to have died intestate. The court will not give effect to an earlier will, as it had already been revoked.

'''Luis Montes Mieza''' (1949 &amp;ndash; 19 April 2018), was a [[Spain|Spanish]] anesthetist and pro-[[euthanasia]] activist. He was the Federal President of the association "Derecho a Morir Dignamente" from 2009 till his death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eutanasia.ws/quienes_somos.html QUIÉNES SOMOS] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic and professional biography ==
Dr. Montes had a degree in Medicine from the [[Complutense University of Madrid]]. In 1987 he joined as an [[anesthesiologist]] in the recently created Hospital Severo Ochoa of [[Leganés]], of which he was Director and, since 2000, Emergency Coordinator of the Hospital, a position he held until 2005. At the time of his death, he was a physician in the Emergency Department of the Severo Ochoa Hospital in Leganés.

== Leganés case ==
=== Complaint of the Regional Ministry of Health of the Community of Madrid against Luis Montes and Miguel Ángel López - Dismissed ===

In May 2005 Luis Montes Mieza and [[Miguel Ángel López Varas]] were investigated by the Health Department of the Community of Madrid, by Manuel Lamela Fernández, because of two anonymous denunciations in which they were accused of [[sedations]] in high doses in terminally ill patients in the Emergency Service of the Severo Ochoa Hospital that he coordinated. According to press reports, at that time the deaths in the emergency room of Severo Ochoa tripled percentage of the average of the other hospitals in [[Madrid]]. The report presented by the Regional Ministry of Health identified 73 cases of sedation performed incorrectly between 1 September 2003 and 8 March 2005. In 2005, Dr. Montes Mieza was dismissed as coordinator at the request of Lamela. According to press reports, after the dismissal of Montes as Director of the Severo Ochoa Emergency Department, deaths in the service were halved. In January 2008, the court closed the case ratifying the dismissal that already in the month of June 2007 had determined and suppressed the legal basis that refers to the malpractice of the defendants. &lt;ref&gt; [https://elpais.com/diario/2009/04/18/sociedad/1240005602_850215.html Lamela declarará ante la juez por denuncia falsa en el 'caso Leganés'] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The courts concluded that the causes of deaths in the cases analyzed were not can certainly be attributed to the sedation, so the accusation was not proven, which does not mean that the Court had ruled the absence of malpractice.

=== Complaint by Luis Montes and Miguel Ángel López against the Evaluation Commission - Dismissal ===

On 28 January 2009, Luis Montes Mieza and Miguel Ángel López filed a complaint - admitted for processing - for false accusation and falsehood against Manuel Lamela Fernández and the six doctors who signed the report with which he was accused of incriminating - Isidro Álvarez Martín, of the Regional Ministry of Health; Hernán Cortés-Funes, of Hospital 12 de Octubre; Manuel Gómez Barón, of [[Hospital Universitario La Paz]]; DoloreS Crespo Hervás, of Hospital Ramón y Cajal; Francisco López Timoneda, of Hospital Clínico de Madrid and Bartolomé Bonet Serra, of the Hospital de [[Alcorcón]]-.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.es/20090610/nacional-madrid/sedaciones-leganes-retornan-juzgados-200906100415.html Las sedaciones de Leganés retornan a los Juzgados con Montes como acusación] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011 the chief of the Court of Instruction Number 43 of Madrid agreed on the "free dismissal and the file" of the complaint. &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.larazon.es/historico/3025-archivada-la-querella-del-doctor-montes-contra-lamela-TLLA_RAZON_368639 Archivada la querella del doctor Montes contra Lamela] {{es icon}} &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Luis Montes's complaint against Miguel Ángel Rodríguez for insults - Conviction ===
In April 2011, the sentence condemning Miguel Ángel Rodríguez, former spokesman of the government of [[José María Aznar]], was convicted to pay 30,000 euros as the author of a "continuing offense of serious injury with advertising" against Luis Montes Mieza.&lt;ref&gt;[https://elpais.com/elpais/2011/04/25/actualidad/1303719423_850215.html Miguel Ángel Rodríguez, condenado por llamar "nazi" al doctor Montes] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.losgenoveses.net/Personajes%20Populares/Varios/mar1.html MIGUEL ÁNGEL RODRÍGUEZ BAJÓN :  UN BOCAZAS REINCIDENTE] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Federal Presidency of the Right to Die Dignity association ==
From 2009 until his death on 2018, Luis Montes was the Federal President of the association Right to Dignify Dignity, an association that defends the decriminalization of [[euthanasia]], universal access to [[palliative care]] hospital and extra-hospital, to [[ sedation]], the implantation and diffusion of the [[living will]], and the right to the autonomy of the patient, as well as respect for his will and [[individual freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diariodenavarra.es/20101016/navarra/la-medicina-esta-alargar-muertes-inevitables.html?not=2010101602045902&amp;idnot=2010101602045902&amp;dia=20101016&amp;seccion=navarra&amp;seccion2=sociedad&amp;chnl=10 La medicina no está para alargar muertes inevitables". Luis Montes fue diana de la opinión pública tras ser acusado de practicar sedaciones irregulares a pacientes terminales en el Hospital Severo Ochoa. La Justicia lo absolvió en 2008 y hoy continúa su tarea de defender el derecho a morir dignamente, 16/10/2010] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the government of [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]], by [[Ministry of Health (Spain)|Minister of Health]], [[Leire Pajín]], promoted in [[Congress of Deputies]] a national law on dignified death (under the name of the Law Regulating the Rights of the Person before the Final Process of Life) that could not be processed before the end of the legislature in November 2011, with the aim of regulating at national level much of what is included in the territorial laws on which it was inspired and which aim to provide legal security for professionals and guarantees for patients and family members within the framework of medical praxis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719081315/http://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/2011/05/14/sociedad/estado/la-ley-de-muerte-digna-permitira-al-enfermo-terminal-decidir-sobre-el-final-de-su-vida La ley de Muerte Digna permitirá al enfermo terminal decidir sobre el final de su vida] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliaments of [[Andalusia]], [[Aragón]] and [[Navarra]] approved same laws.

== Deaths ==
Montes died on 19 April 2018, of a heart attack, while driving to [[Molina de Segura]] ([[Region of Murcia]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/madrid/2018/04/19/5ad8a9cdca47416a648b45d7.html Muere Luis Montes, el anestesista que en 2005 fue investigado por 'mala praxis' en las sedaciones a pacientes terminales] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:MagnaCarta 2 - Gameplay.jpg|left|thumb|275px|A battle late in the game, with Argo, Zephie, and Rue in play against Northern Forces soldiers. Here, the player is controlling Argo.]]
In ''MagnaCarta 2'', the player controls their characters from a third-person perspective, usually in one of two "Modes". In Movement Mode, the player explores the area, talks with other characters and interacts with the environment. In Combat Mode, the player character enters a battle stance, which lets them fight enemies at the cost of slower movement speed.&lt;ref name=mc2_kr_syswar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magnacarta.kr/Systems/SysWar.aspx |title=Magnacarta2 system|work=마그나카르타2 XBOX |publisher=Magnacarta.kr|language=Korean |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's battle system combines strategic turn-based and real-time elements and battles directly occur in the field, with no loading screens. Up to three active members can be in the field at any one time, with the remaining three members waiting to be switched in. The player can choose between using normal attacks or moves that use Kan, a type of energy. These Kan moves generate or use Kan. If all three active members' [[health (gaming)|hit points]] reach zero, [[Game over|the game is over]] and the player restarts from their last save point.&lt;ref name=mc2_kr_syswar /&gt;

As the player presses the attack button, their character's "Overdrive" gauge will fill up. Once full, the character will enter an "Overdrive" state, where their attack power is increased. However, once the player can no longer attack, their character will fall into an "Overheat" state, rendering them unable to attack until the gauge lowers enough for them to attack again. Players can use this gauge to their advantage by using "Chain Drives"—the process of Overdriving one character into Overheat, immediately switching to another character already present, then Overdriving them as well. This frees both members' Overdrive gauges, enabling both to attack without hindrance. Players can also use Solo and Co-op Techniques, which unleash devastating combination attacks on their target.&lt;ref name=mc2_kr_syswar /&gt;

The player collects Kamonds to power-up weapons via their accompanying "Kamond Board". Kamonds are also used to strengthen characters and craft new items. Kamonds are usually obtained by defeating monsters or Sentinels, but can also be found in treasure chests or as rewards for finishing quests. At Kamond Shops, players can craft to turn Kamonds into new accessories. Recipes and money are needed to craft with Kamonds. Recipes are earned as rewards for completing certain quests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magnacarta.kr/Systems/SysField.aspx |title=Magnacarta2 system|work=마그나카르타2 XBOX |publisher=Magnacarta.kr|language=Korean |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mc2_goes_gold&gt;{{cite web|title=Magnacarta 2 Goes Gold: New Screenshots |url=http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/21096/Magnacarta-2-Goes-Gold-New-Screenshots/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005025952/http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/21096/Magnacarta-2-Goes-Gold-New-Screenshots |archivedate=October 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MagnaCarta 2 - Main Cast.jpg|240px|thumbnail|left|The main cast of ''MagnaCarta 2''. Top row: Juto (left), Zephie, and Argo. Bottom row: Crocell, Celestine, and Rue.]]
''MagnaCarta 2'' is set in the fictional kingdom of Lanzheim, divided by an ongoing civil war between the Northern Forces, led by the usurper Shuenzeit Baron; and the Southern Forces, led by Rzephilda "Zephie" Berlinette, the Princess of Lanzheim. In response to the Northern Forces' "Sentinels"—destructive, living weapons based on the extinct Carta race—Zephie forms the Counter-Sentinel Unit in order to turn the tide. However, while trying to find the Sentinels' weakness, Zephie's bodyguard Rue is captured by the Northern Forces. Zephie goes to rescue her friend: however, as they make their escape, they are intercepted by Schuenzeit's best soldier, Elgar the Regicide. Zephie takes Elgar's killing blow to Rue and despite what should have been a mortal wound, drives Elgar away.&lt;ref name=prologue&gt;{{cite video game|title=MagnaCarta 2|developer=[[Softmax (game developer)|Softmax]]|publisher=[[Banpresto]], [[Namco Bandai Games]], [[Atari]]|date=6 August – 16 October 2009|platform=[[Xbox 360]]|version=|scene=Prologue|level=|quote='''Narrator''': It was January, in the year 1149 of the Lanzheim calendar.

&lt;!-- The game contains character designs by Korean artist [[Hyung-tae Kim]], who has done the same for the previous installments and includes fully voiced CGI cut-scenes to deliver parts of its narrative.

The game received generally mixed reviews from critics, earning an aggregate [[Metacritic]] score of 69.&lt;ref name=mc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/magna-carta-2|title=Magna Carta 2 for Xbox 360|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] criticized the battle system stating, "this feels almost archaic and could have been run on a PS1, enemy AI is almost non-existent and character abilities are generic."&lt;ref name=ign&gt;{{cite web|last=Brudvig|first=Erik|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/10/13/magnacarta-2-review|title=Magnacarta 2 Review|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=IGN|date=13 October 2009|accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Townslend of ''[[Game Informer]]'' said, "While the story starts off having the potential to be great, it quickly degrades into the same old story of a young man with no memories saving a kingdom.

'''Joana Isabel Cipriano''' (born 31 May 1996) disappeared on 12 September 2004 from [[Figueira (Faro)|Figueira]], a village near [[Portimão]] in the [[Algarve]] region of [[Portugal]]. An investigation by the ''[[Polícia Judiciária]]'', Portugal's criminal police, concluded that she had been murdered by her mother, Leonor Cipriano, and her uncle, João Cipriano, after witnessing them engaged in [[incest]]uous sex. Her body was never found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hamilos |first1=Paul |last2=de Beer |first2=Brendan |date=3 October 2007 |title=Detective leading hunt for Madeleine sacked after blast at UK police |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/oct/03/ukcrime.uknews4 |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |access-date=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mother and uncle [[confession|confessed]] to police in October 2004; the uncle said he had cut the girl's body into pieces before disposing of it somewhere in [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=PortugalNews&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Prosecution unveils horror of girl’s death |url=http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/view/805-48 |work=The Portugal News |location= |date=14 May 2005 |access-date=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joana's mother withdrew her confession the day after signing it, alleging that she had been beaten during a 48-hour-long interrogation. The police officers accounted for the bruising on the mother's face and body by maintaining that she had thrown herself down some stairs in the police station in an effort to commit suicide. Both the mother and uncle were convicted of murder and sentenced to sixteen years in jail.&lt;ref name=Govan26May2007/&gt; It was the first murder trial in Portuguese legal history to take place [[murder conviction without a body|without the discovery of a body]].&lt;ref name=Watts12May2008&gt;{{cite news |last1=Watts |first1=Alex |date=12 May 2008 |title='Disturbing Similarities' With Madeleine |url=http://news.sky.com/story/603144/disturbing-similarities-with-madeleine |dead-url=y |language=English |work=[[Sky News]] |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234140/http://news.sky.com/story/603144/disturbing-similarities-with-madeleine |archive-date=3 March 2016 |access-date=October 14, 2017 |via=[[Internet Archive]] [[Wayback Machine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amaral was not present during the alleged assault, but was accused of having covered up for other officers; he was convicted of having falsified police documents in the case and received an eighteen-month suspended sentence.&lt;ref name=PA22May2009&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=22 May 2009 |title='McCann detective guilty of perjury |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/feedarticle/8521559 |dead-url=y |language=English |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |agency=[[Press Association]] |archive-url=http://truthcannotbesilenced.blogspot.pt/2009/05/madeleine-detective-convicted-of.html |archive-date=22 October 2009 |access-date=October 14, 2017 |via=Truth be Told}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several similarities between the cases—both girls vanished without trace within {{convert|7|mi}} and less than three years of each other, both cases had officers who failed to secure the [[crime scene]], both mothers mounted campaigns to find their daughters and both women were accused of involvement—prompted Joana's family to [[appeal]] in 2008 for police to investigate whether there was a link between the disappearances.&lt;ref name=Watts12May2008/&gt;

Joana Cipriano, eight years old at the time, was last seen at around 8 pm on the evening she disappeared, after being sent to buy milk and a tin of tuna from a local store. A neighbour saw her around 200 yards from her house, walking back from the store. Her mother, Leonor Cipriano, launched a local campaign to find her daughter, distributing posters around the neighbourhood.&lt;ref name=Watts12May2008/&gt;

The [[prosecution]] argued that Joana was killed because she had seen her mother and João Cipriano, her mother's brother, [[incest|having sex]]. Leonor [[confession|confessed]] to killing her daughter after nearly 48 hours of continuous interrogation. Her brother confessed to having assaulted Joana, and said he had cut her body into small pieces and placed her inside a [[refrigerator]], which was put inside an old car that was taken to [[Spain]] to be crushed and burned.&lt;ref name=PortugalNews/&gt; When he was asked if he had [[sexual abuse|sexually abused]] Joana, he said, "I did not harm her - I only killed her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Marques |first=Sara |date=5 September 2007 |title='Eu não lhe fiz mal, só a matei' |trans-title='I did not harm her, I only killed her' |url=http://diario.iol.pt/sociedade/joana-morte-algarve-pj-homicidio/850467-4071.html |dead-url=y |language=Portuguese |work=IOLDiário |location=Lisbon |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20150509005133/http://diario.iol.pt/sociedade/joana-morte-algarve-pj-homicidio/850467-4071.html |archive-date=9 May 2015 |access-date=14 October 2017 |via=Arquivo da Web Portuguesa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonor retracted her confession the day after making it, claiming she had been beaten. She suffered extensive bruising to her face and body, which the police said was caused by her throwing herself down some stairs in the police station in an effort to kill herself. Five officers, including [[Gonçalo Amaral]], head of the regional ''[[Polícia Judiciária]]'' in [[Portimão]] at the time, were charged with a number of offences. The [[indictment]] alleged that several of them had kicked Leonor, hit her with a cardboard tube, put a plastic bag over her head, and made her kneel on glass ashtrays.&lt;ref name=Watts12May2008/&gt;

A child protection specialist, [[Mark Williams-Thomas]], who believes that Joana's and Madeleine's disappearances are related, said that the disappearance of two children unknown to each other, within a period of four years in a seven-mile radius, would be a huge [[coincidence]], especially considering that Portugal is a small country with few abductions.&lt;ref name=Watts14Sep2007/&gt; Before Joana's disappearance, the previous [[first-degree murder]] of a child in the [[Algarve]] region was in November 1990 and involved a British girl, nine-year-old Rachel Charles, who was abducted and murdered in [[Albufeira]]. Her body was found three days later; a British mechanic and friend of the family, Michael Cook, was arrested and convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tweedie |first1=Neil |last2=Edwards |first2=Richard |date=12 May 2007 |title=Have police failed Madeleine? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1551346/Have-police-failed-Madeleine.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |access-date=14 October 2017 }}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6623">'''Johnathon Robert Madden''' (11 May 1991 &amp;ndash; 25 November 2003) was a twelve-year-old [[Canada|Canadian]] boy  whose gruesome [[murder]] at the hands of his sixteen-year-old brother Kevin Madden and his brother's friend Timothy Ferriman provoked widespread revulsion and outrage in Johnathon's home city of [[Toronto]] and across Canada.

The ensuing trials of Madden and Ferriman have created a media sensation in Toronto and in the Canadian English media generally, which intensified after the first trial ended in a mistrial when a key [[witness]] was discovered to have committed [[perjury]].

Madden and Ferriman were convicted, respectively, of first-degree murder and [[manslaughter]] in early 2006, but until September 29, 2006, when Justice David McCombs elected to sentence the youths as adults, the names of the principals in the case were precluded from publication by provisions of Canada's [[Youth Criminal Justice Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060930.wxjohnathon30/BNStory/National/home|title=This was Johnathon|publisher=Globe and Mail|date=September 30, 2006|accessdate=2006-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
On the afternoon of November 25, Kevin Madden (then 16) was at home, accompanied by Timothy Ferriman and another friend, who remains publicly unidentified.  The three began to extensively [[vandalism|vandalize]] the family home, smashing beer bottles and a television with baseball bats, while drinking wine.  Less than an hour before attacking Johnathon, all three spoke on the telephone to Ferriman's girlfriend indicating that a mass murder would occur; she tape-recorded this conversation.

Shortly thereafter, Kevin Madden attacked Johnathon with a [[butcher knife]], cutting his face and neck 71 times, and severing his [[larynx|voice box]] and his [[carotid artery]].  Though present, Ferriman did not stab Johnathon himself but encouraged Kevin and handed him the knife, and afterwards helped to move Johnathon's body.

Following Johnathon's death, the boys hid his body in a basement crawl space.   Together, the three awaited the arrival of Kevin's and Johnathon's stepfather, Ralston Champagnie, coming home from work.  Upon Champagnie's arrival, he was attacked with a baseball bat and knife, but managed to escape from the house.

Johnathon's body was retrieved later that evening.  All three boys were arrested within 24 hours of the incident.

== First court case ==
The first court case relied on Ferriman's girlfriend as the Crown's key witness.  It ended in a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]] after she apparently [[perjury|perjured]] herself.

She made several posts on the site [[vampirefreaks.com]] indicating an interest in [[vampirism]], which contradicted earlier court testimony.

== Second court case ==
During the second case, Kevin Madden stated that "people who did not know Johnathon should not be concerned about what happened to him" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://torontosun.com/News/TorontoAndGTA/2006/09/30/1924478-sun.html| title=Murderer 'a deeply disturbed young man'|publisher=Toronto Sun|date=September 30, 2006|accessdate=2006-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The verdict for the second court case was delivered on 27 February 2006.  The jury determined that Kevin Madden was guilty of first-degree murder for his role in Johnathon's death, and guilty of attempted murder for his attack on his stepfather, Champagnie.  Ferriman was found guilty of manslaughter for assisting in Johnathon's death. The third boy, who remains unidentified, was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=1159523528068&amp;call_pageid=968332188492&amp;col=968793972154&amp;t=TS_Home| title=Johnathon's killers jailed|publisher=Toronto Star|date=September 30, 2006|accessdate=2006-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sentencing hearing on 29 September 2006, Justice David McCombs determined that Madden and Ferriman should be sentenced as adults, which permitted their identities, and those of the rest of Madden's family, to be published for the first time.

Both Madden's and Ferriman's lawyers indicated they were displeased with that their clients were not sentenced as youths.  Speaking of Madden, who had expressed no remorse or emotion in response to his actions throughout the trials, his lawyer said "Kevin desperately needs treatment, and unfortunately he's not going to get it.  We could have had 10 years of in-depth treatment in the youth system and he's not going to get it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060929.wjohnathan0929/BNStory/National/home| title=Two teens sentenced as adults in Johnathon killing|publisher=Globe and Mail|date=September 29, 2006|accessdate=2006-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ferriman's lawyer indicated he would appeal the decision, while Madden's lawyer said he was considering it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=8050a224-47c4-433b-b1ed-48a057cc436d&amp;k=3314|title=Mother weeps as oldest son handed life sentence for stabbing death of her youngest|publisher=Canada.com|date=September 30, 2006|accessdate=2006-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sentencing hearing, Ferriman addressed the court and apologized for what he had done.  His remorse enabled his sentence to be served in a youth facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2006/09/29/johnathan-sentence.html| title='Johnathan' named as teen killers receive adult sentences|publisher=CBC News|date=September 30, 2006|accessdate=2006-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6004">The '''National Campus Climate Survey (NCCS)''' is a service offered to institutions of [[higher education]] in the [[United States]] who would like to better understand and improve their campus climate with regards to [[sexual assault]] and related topics.  The study is designed to:

# Meet all state and federal requirements for the conduct of sexual assault [[Survey methodology|survey]]s.
# Provide a scientifically rigorous survey instrument to help schools learn about the campus climate concerning [[sexual misconduct]].
# Provide varying survey implementation tiers to match institutions’ varying needs for defensible data.
# Provide a benchmarking tool to allow institutions to compare their results against other participating institutions, and where possible, peer groups.

The National Campus Climate Survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schlissel|first1=Mark|title=U-M 2015 Campus Climate Surveys Regarding Sexual Misconduct|url=https://publicaffairs.vpcomm.umich.edu/key-issues/faq-on-2015-campus-climate-surveys-regarding-sexual-misconduct/|website=U-M Public Affairs &amp; Internal Communications|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed at the [[University of Michigan]] in collaboration with a local survey research firm, SoundRocket (formerly known as Survey Sciences Group, LLC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SoundRocket: A name is selected|url=http://www.soundrocket.com/soundrocket-blog/2015/7/21/our-story-part-5|website=SoundRocket|publisher=The Launch Pad Blog|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study was developed in response to the report from the [[White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault]].

== The National Campus Climate Survey ==

=== Study Website &amp; Enrollment ===
The National Campus Climate Survey launched its service and website ([http://www.nationalcampusclimatesurvey.com www.nationalcampusclimatesurvey.com]) on September 1, 2015 and is currently enrolling institutions of higher education into the Spring 2016 data collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Assault Survey Now Available for Multi-Institutional Enrollment|url=http://www.nationalcampusclimatesurvey.org/news/2015/9/2/sexual-assault-survey-now-available-for-multi-institutional-enrollment|website=National Campus Climate Survey|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Study Design ===
The core NCCS design uses a sample survey approach rather than a [[census]] of all students. (However, schools will have the option to conduct a census if they wish.) A randomly selected sample of students (undergraduates and graduates) allows the study to make scientifically based inferences to the population as a whole, helps focus finite research resources on successfully contacting and encouraging the participation of the broadest group of students, and reduces survey burden on an often over-surveyed population.

The NCCS will request sample data from university registrars (i.e. gender, race/ethnicity, year in school, on/off campus residence) in addition to contact information to allow for nonresponse analyses to be conducted. If deemed appropriate, the NCCS may generate nonresponse bias weights for the final analytic data file.

The NCCS will be implemented as a web-based, mobile-optimized survey, to ensure the data collected is of highest quality. Logical branching and filters will be used to tailor the questionnaire appropriately for each individual. Data collection will include at least four email contacts, and may include mailed prenotification letters, telephone calls, and in-person visits (depending on the service level selected). Data will be collected between January and April, 2016.

=== Service Levels ===
The NCCS has a three-tiered service structure, designed to meet the specific needs of the local campus.

{| class="wikitable"

|}

More specifics regarding the Tier services are available on the [http://www.nationalcampusclimatesurvey.org/service-levels/ study website service levels page].

=== Survey Instrument ===
The survey instrument and methodology were designed by a team, led by the University of Michigan’s Survey Research Center and including representatives from Student Life at the University of Michigan, the Office of the General Counsel at the University of Michigan, and SoundRocket. The team designed the survey measurements to include both the prevalence and incidence of sexual assault on campus, as well as perceptions of campus climate. The methodological team drew heavily upon behavioral-specific questions from the Sexual Experiences Survey to measure the prevalence and incidence of sexual assault, because such questions have been researched and validated. (1) The design features of this survey have demonstrated effectiveness in minimizing response errors in web surveys, as well as minimizing overall respondent burden. (2) The average length for completion of the survey instrument is less than 15 minutes.  

An early draft of the survey instrument is available at the [https://publicaffairs.vpcomm.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2015/04/Campus-climate-survey-questions.pdf University of Michigan 2015 Campus Climate Surveys Regarding Sexual Misconduct] page.

'''Reductionism''' is any of several related philosophical ideas regarding the associations between phenomena which can be described in terms of other simpler or more fundamental phenomena.&lt;ref name=MerriamWebster/&gt;

''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'' suggests that reductionism is "one of the most used and abused terms in the philosophical lexicon" and suggests a three part division:&lt;ref name=Ruse&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |author=Michael Ruse |editor=Ted Honderich |isbn=9780191037474 |year=2005 |edition=2nd |chapter=Entry for "reductionism" |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=793 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJFCAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1884}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Ontological reductionism''': a belief that the whole of reality consists of a minimal number of parts.
#'''Methodological reductionism''': the scientific attempt to provide explanation in terms of ever smaller entities.
#'''Theory reductionism''': the suggestion that a newer theory does not replace or absorb an older one, but reduces it to more basic terms. Theory reduction itself is divisible into three parts: translation, derivation and explanation.&lt;ref name=Ney/&gt;

Reductionism can be applied to any [[phenomenon]], including [[object (philosophy)|objects]], [[explanation]]s, [[theory|theories]], and meanings.&lt;ref name=Ney/&gt;&lt;ref name=Polkinghorne&gt;
{{cite web |title=Reductionism  |author=John Polkinghorne |url=http://www.disf.org/en/Voci/104.asp |work=Interdisciplinary Encyclopedia of Religion and Science|date=2002 |publisher=Advanced School for Interdisciplinary Research; Pontifical University of the Holy Cross}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
For reductionism referred to [[explanation]]s, [[theory|theories]], and meanings, see [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]'s ''[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]''. Quine objected to the [[positivism|positivistic]], reductionist "belief that each meaningful statement is equivalent to some logical construct upon terms which refer to immediate experience" as an intractable problem.
&lt;/ref&gt;

For the sciences, application of methodological reductionism attempts explanation of entire systems in terms of their individual, constituent parts and their interactions. For example, the temperature of a gas is reduced to nothing beyond the average kinetic energy of its molecules in motion. [[Thomas Nagel]] speaks of 'psychophysical reductionism' (the attempted reduction of psychological phenomena to physics and chemistry), as do others and 'physico-chemical reductionism' (the attempted reduction of biology to physics and chemistry), again as do others.&lt;ref name=Nagel/&gt; In a very simplified and sometimes contested form, such reductionism is said to imply that a system is nothing but the sum of its parts.&lt;ref name=Polkinghorne/&gt;&lt;ref name=GodfreySmith/&gt; However, a more nuanced opinion is that a system is composed entirely of its parts, but the system will have features that none of the parts have.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; "The point of mechanistic explanations is usually showing how the higher level features arise from the parts."&lt;ref name=GodfreySmith/&gt;

Other definitions are used by other authors. For example, what [[John Polkinghorne]] terms 'conceptual' or 'epistemological' reductionism&lt;ref name=Polkinghorne/&gt; is the definition provided by [[Simon Blackburn]]&lt;ref name=Blackburn&gt;{{cite book |author=Simon Blackburn |title= Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy |chapter=Entry on ‘reductionism’ |page=311 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5wTQtwB1NdgC&amp;pg=PA311}}. Richard Jones distinguishes the two, arguing that many ontological and epistemological reductionists affirm the need for different concepts for different degrees of complexity while affirming a reduction of theories.  Richard H. Jones (2000), ''Reductionism: Analysis and the Fuullness of Reality'', pp. 27-28, 32. Lewisburg, Pa.: Bucknell University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Jaegwon Kim]]:&lt;ref name=Kim&gt;
{{cite book |author=Jaegwon Kim |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy  |editor=Ted Honderich |isbn=9780191037474 |year=2005 |edition=2nd |chapter=Entry for ‘mental reductionism’ |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=794 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJFCAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1885}}&lt;/ref&gt; that form of reductionism concerning a program of replacing the facts or entities entering statements claimed to be true in one type of discourse with other facts or entities from another type, thereby providing a relationship between them. Such an association is provided where the same idea can be expressed by "levels" of explanation, with higher levels reducible if need be to lower levels. This use of levels of understanding in part expresses our human limitations in remembering detail. However, "most philosophers would insist that our role in conceptualizing reality [our need for an hierarchy of "levels" of understanding] does not change the fact that different levels of organization in reality do have different 'properties'."&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;

Reductionism strongly represents a certain perspective of [[causality]]. In a reductionist framework, the phenomena that can be explained completely in terms of relations between other more fundamental phenomena, are termed [[epiphenomena]]. Often there is an implication that the epiphenomenon exerts no causal agency on the fundamental phenomena that explain it. The epiphenomena are sometimes said to be "nothing but" the outcome of the workings of the fundamental phenomena, although the epiphenomena might be more clearly and efficiently described in very different terms. There is a tendency to avoid considering an epiphenomenon as being important in its own right. This attitude may extend to cases where the fundamentals are not obviously able to explain the epiphenomena, but are expected to by the speaker. In this way, for example, morality can be deemed to be "nothing but" evolutionary adaptation, and consciousness can be considered "nothing but" the outcome of neurobiological processes.

Reductionism should be distinguished from [[Eliminative materialism|eliminationism]]: reductionists do not deny the existence of phenomena, but explain them in terms of another reality; eliminationists deny the existence of the phenomena themselves. For example, eliminationists deny the existence of life by their explanation in terms of physical and chemical processes.

Reductionism also does not preclude the existence of what might be termed [[Emergence|emergent phenomena]], but it does imply the ability to understand those phenomena completely in terms of the processes from which they are composed. This reductionist understanding is very different from [[emergentism]], which intends that what emerges in "emergence" is more than the sum of the processes from which it emerges.&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod and Cohen "Harnessing Complexity"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Most philosophers delineate three types of reductionism and anti-reductionism.&lt;ref name="Ruse"/&gt;

===Ontological reductionism===
Ontological reductionism is the belief that reality is composed of a minimum number of kinds of entities or substances. This claim is usually [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], and is most commonly a form of [[monism]], in effect claiming that all objects, properties and events are reducible to a single substance. (A [[mind-body dualism|dualist]] who is an ontological reductionist would believe that everything is reducible to two substances—as one possible example, a dualist might claim that reality is composed of "[[matter]]" and "[[spirit]]".)

Richard Jones divides ontological reductionism into two: the reductionism of substances (e.g., the reduction of mind to matter) and the reduction of the number of structures operating in nature (e.g., the reduction of one physical force to another). This permits scientists and philosophers to affirm the former while being anti-reductionists regarding the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Jones (2000), ''Reductionism: Analysis and the Fuullness of Reality'', pp. 24-26, 29-31. Lewisburg, Pa.: Bucknell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nancey Murphy]] has claimed that there are two species of ontological reductionism: one that denies that wholes are anything more than their parts; and the stronger thesis of atomist reductionism that wholes are not "really real". She admits that the phrase "really real" is apparently senseless but nonetheless has tried to explicate the supposed difference between the two.&lt;ref&gt;Nancey Murphy, "Reductionism and Emergence. A Critical Perspective." In ''Human Identity at the Intersection of Science, Technology and Religion''. Edited by Nancey Murphy, and Christopher C. Knight. Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2010. P. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ontological reductionism denies the idea of ontological [[emergence]], and claims that emergence is an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] phenomenon that only exists through analysis or description of a system, and does not exist fundamentally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-9213.00136 Michael Silberstein, John McGeever, "The Search for Ontological Emergence", ''The Philosophical Quarterly'', Vol. 49, No. 195 (April 1999)], ({{ISSN|0031-8094}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ontological reductionism takes two different forms: '''token ontological reductionism''' and '''type ontological reductionism'''.

Token ontological reductionism is the idea that every item that exists is a sum item. For perceivable items, it affirms that every perceivable item is a sum of items with a lesser degree of complexity. Token ontological reduction of biological things to chemical things is generally accepted.

Type ontological reductionism is the idea that every type of item is a sum type of item, and that every perceivable type of item is a sum of types of items with a lesser degree of complexity. Type ontological reduction of biological things to chemical things is often rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_reductionism.html|title=Reductionism - By Branch / Doctrine - The Basics of Philosophy|work=philosophybasics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Ruse]] has criticized ontological reductionism as an improper argument against [[vitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/29/3/1061.pdf] Michael Ruse, "Do Organisms Exist?", Am. Zool., 29: 1061–1066 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodological reductionism===
Methodological reductionism is the position that the best scientific strategy is to attempt to reduce explanations to the smallest possible entities. Methodological reductionism would thus include the claim that the atomic explanation of a substance's boiling point is preferable to the chemical explanation, and that an explanation based on even smaller particles ([[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s, perhaps) would be even better.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}}  Methodological reductionism, therefore, is the opinion that all scientific theories either can or should be reduced to a single super~theory through the process of theoretical reduction.

===Theory reductionism===
Theory reduction is the process by which one theory absorbs another. For example, both [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler's]] laws of the motion of the [[planet]]s and [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s theories of motion formulated for terrestrial objects are reducible to Newtonian theories of mechanics because all the explanatory power of the former are contained within the latter. Furthermore, the reduction is considered to be beneficial because [[Newtonian mechanics]] is a more general theory—that is, it explains more events than Galileo's or Kepler's. Theoretical reduction, therefore, is the reduction of one explanation or theory to another—that is, it is the absorption of one of our ideas about a particular item into another idea.

==In science==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2011}}
Reductionist thinking and methods form the basis for many of the well-developed topics of modern [[science]], including much of [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[cell biology]]. [[Classical mechanics]] in particular is seen as a reductionist framework, and [[statistical mechanics]] can be considered as a reconciliation of [[macroscopic]] [[thermodynamic laws]] with the reductionist method of explaining macroscopic properties in terms of [[microscopic]] components.

In science, reductionism implies that certain topics of study are based on areas that study smaller spatial scales or organizational units. While it is commonly accepted that the foundations of [[chemistry]] are based in [[physics]], and [[molecular biology]] is based on chemistry, similar statements become controversial when one considers less rigorously defined intellectual pursuits. For example, claims that [[sociology]] is based on [[psychology]], or that [[economics]] is based on [[sociology]] and [[psychology]] would be met with reservations. These claims are difficult to substantiate even though there are obvious associations between these topics (for instance, most would agree that [[psychology]] can affect and inform [[economics]]). The limit of reductionism's usefulness stems from [[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|emergent properties]] of [[complex systems]], which are more common at certain levels of organization. For example, certain aspects of [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[sociobiology]] are rejected by some who claim that complex systems are inherently irreducible and that a [[holistic]] method is needed to understand them.

Some strong reductionists believe that the behavioral sciences should become "genuine" scientific disciplines based on genetic biology, and on the systematic study of culture (see Richard Dawkins's concept of [[memes]]). In his book ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', [[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins]] introduced the term "hierarchical reductionism"&lt;ref&gt;Interview with magazine ''[[Third Way (magazine)|Third Way]]'' in which [[Richard Dawkins]] discusses reductionism and religion, February 28, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the opinion that complex systems can be described with a hierarchy of organizations, each of which is only described in terms of objects one level down in the hierarchy. He provides the example of a computer, which using hierarchical reductionism is explained in terms of the operation of [[hard drive]]s, processors, and memory, but not on the level of [[logic gates]], or on the even simpler level of electrons in a [[semiconductor]] medium.

Others argue that inappropriate use of reductionism limits our understanding of complex systems. In particular, ecologist [[Robert Ulanowicz]] says that science must develop techniques to study ways in which larger scales of organization influence smaller ones, and also ways in which feedback loops create structure at a given level, independently of details at a lower level of organization. He advocates (and uses) [[information theory]] as a framework to study [[Propensity probability|propensities]] in natural systems.&lt;ref&gt;R.E. Ulanowicz, ''Ecology: The Ascendant Perspective'', Columbia University Press (1997) ({{ISBN|0-231-10828-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; Ulanowicz attributes these criticisms of reductionism to the philosopher [[Karl Popper]] and biologist [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ulanowicz | first1 = R.E. | year = 1996 | title = Ecosystem Development: Symmetry Arising? | url = http://people.biology.ufl.edu/ulan/pubs/Symmetry.PDF | journal = Symmetry: Culture and Science | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 321–334 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130530212418/http://people.biology.ufl.edu/ulan/pubs/Symmetry.PDF | archivedate = 2013-05-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that phenomena such as [[emergence]] and work within the topic of [[complex systems]] theory pose limits to reductionism has been advocated by [[Stuart Kauffman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/kauffman06/kauffman06_index.html Beyond Reductionism: Reinventing the Sacred] by Stuart Kauffman&lt;/ref&gt; Emergence is especially relevant when systems exhibit historicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Longo|first=Giuseppe|last2=Montévil|first2=Maël|last3=Kauffman|first3=Stuart|date=2012-01-01|title=No Entailing Laws, but Enablement in the Evolution of the Biosphere|url=https://www.academia.edu/11720588|journal=Proceedings of the 14th Annual Conference Companion on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation|series=GECCO '12|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|volume=|pages=1379–1392|doi=10.1145/2330784.2330946|isbn=9781450311786|via=|arxiv=1201.2069|citeseerx=10.1.1.701.3838}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emergence is strongly related to [[nonlinearity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://personal.riverusers.com/~rover/RedRev.pdf A. Scott, ''Reductionism Revisited'', Journal of Consciousness Studies, 11, No. 2, 2004 pp. 51–68]&lt;/ref&gt; The limits of the application of reductionism are claimed to be especially evident at levels of organization with higher amounts of [[complexity]], including living [[Cell (biology)|cells]],&lt;ref name=Huber2013&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Huber |first1=F |last2=Schnauss |first2=J |last3=Roenicke |first3=S |last4=Rauch |first4=P |last5=Mueller |first5=K |last6=Fuetterer |first6=C |last7=Kaes |first7=J  |title=Emergent complexity of the cytoskeleton: from single filaments to tissue |journal=Advances in Physics |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=1–112 |year=2013 |doi=10.1080/00018732.2013.771509|bibcode = 2013AdPhy..62....1H |pmid=24748680 |pmc=3985726}} [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00018732.2013.771509 online]&lt;/ref&gt; [[neural networks]], [[ecosystems]], [[society]], and other systems formed from assemblies of large numbers of diverse components linked by multiple [[feedback loop]]s.&lt;ref name="Huber2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clayton2006&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-last= Clayton |editor1-first= P |editor2-last= Davies |editor2-first= P |title=The Re-emergence of Emergence: The Emergentist Hypothesis from Science to Religion |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nobel prize in physics|Nobel laureate]] [[Philip Warren Anderson]] used the idea that [[symmetry breaking]] is an example of an emergent phenomenon in his 1972 ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' paper "More is different" to make an argument about the limitations of reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/08/bblonder/phys120/docs/anderson.pdf Link] {{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=P.W.|title=More is Different|journal=Science|volume=177|issue=4047| pages=393–396|year=1972|doi=10.1126/science.177.4047.393|pmid=17796623|bibcode=1972Sci...177..393A}}&lt;/ref&gt; One observation he made was that the sciences can be arranged roughly in a linear hierarchy—[[particle physics]], [[solid state physics]], [[chemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[cellular biology]], [[physiology]], [[psychology]], [[social sciences]]—in that the elementary entities of one science obeys the principles of the science that precedes it in the hierarchy; yet this does not imply that one science is just an applied version of the science that precedes it. He writes that "At each stage, entirely new laws, concepts and generalizations are necessary, requiring inspiration and creativity to just as great a degree as in the previous one. Psychology is not applied biology nor is biology applied chemistry."

Disciplines such as [[cybernetics]] and [[systems theory]] imply non-reductionism, sometimes to the extent of explaining phenomena at a given level of hierarchy in terms of phenomena at a higher level, in a sense, the opposite of reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/DOWNCAUS.html|title=Downward Causation|work=vub.ac.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In mathematics==
In [[mathematics]], reductionism can be interpreted as the philosophy that all mathematics can (or ought to) be based on a common foundation, which for modern mathematics is usually [[axiomatic set theory]]. [[Ernst Zermelo]] was one of the major advocates of such an opinion; he also developed much of axiomatic set theory. It has been argued that the generally accepted method of justifying mathematical [[axioms]] by their usefulness in common practice can potentially weaken Zermelo's reductionist claim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&amp;id=pdf_1&amp;handle=euclid.ndjfl/1093633905 R. Gregory Taylor, "Zermelo, Reductionism, and the Philosophy of Mathematics". ''Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic'', Vol. 34, No. 4 (Fall 1993)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jouko Väänänen has argued for [[second-order logic]] as a foundation for mathematics instead of set theory,&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.109.7000 J. Väänänen, "Second-Order Logic and Foundations of Mathematics".''The Bulletin of Symbolic Logic'', 7: 504–520 (2001).]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others have argued for [[category theory]] as a foundation for certain aspects of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search/publdoc.html?r=1&amp;pg1=CNO&amp;s1=1406758&amp;loc=fromrevtext S. Awodey, "Structure in Mathematics and Logic: A Categorical Perspective". ''Philos. Math.'' Series III, Vol. 4, No.3 (1996)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.W. Lawvere, "The Category of Categories as a Foundation for Mathematics". ''Proceedings of the Conference on Categorical Algebra (La Jolla, Calif., 1965)'', pp. 1–20. Springer-Verlag, New York (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]] of [[Kurt Gödel]], published during 1931, caused doubt about the attainability of an axiomatic foundation for all of mathematics. Any such foundation would have to include axioms powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers (a subset of all mathematics). Yet Gödel proved that for any self-consistent recursive axiomatic system powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers, there are propositions about the natural numbers that cannot be proved from the axioms, but which we can prove in the natural language with which we described the axioms. Such propositions are known as formally undecidable propositions. For example, the [[continuum hypothesis]] is undecidable in the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]] as shown by [[Forcing (mathematics)|Cohen]].

==In religion==

Religious reductionism generally attempts to explain religion by explaining it in terms of nonreligious causes. A few examples of reductionistic explanations for the presence of religion are: that religion can be reduced to humanity's conceptions of right and wrong, that religion is fundamentally a primitive attempt at controlling our environments, that religion is a way to explain the existence of a physical world, and that religion confers an enhanced survivability for members of a group and so is reinforced by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evolution-of-religion.com/|title=Evolution-of-religion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologists [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] and [[James George Frazer]] employed some [[Metatheories of religion in the social sciences#Edward Burnett Tylor and James George Frazer|religious reductionist arguments]].&lt;ref&gt;Strenski, Ivan. "Classic Twentieth-Century Theorist of the Study of Religion: Defending the Inner Sanctum of Religious Experience or Storming It." Pages 176–209 in ''Thinking About Religion: An Historical Introduction to Theories of Religion''. Malden: Blackwell, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Sigmund Freud held that religion is nothing more than an illusion, or even a mental illness, and Marx claimed that religion is "the sigh of the oppressed," and the [[opium of the people]] providing only "the illusory happiness of the people," thus providing two influential examples of reductionistic views against the idea of religion.

==In linguistics==
Linguistic reductionism is the idea that everything can be described or explained by a language with a limited number of concepts, and combinations of those concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_reductionism.html|title=Reductionism - By Branch / Doctrine - The Basics of Philosophy|website=www.philosophybasics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the language [[Toki Pona]].

==In philosophy==
The concept of [[downward causation]] poses an alternative to reductionism within philosophy. This opinion is developed by [[Peter Bøgh Andersen]], [[Claus Emmeche]], [[Niels Ole Finnemann]], and [[Peder Voetmann Christiansen]], among others. These philosophers explore ways in which one can talk about phenomena at a larger-scale level of organization exerting causal influence on a smaller-scale level, and find that some, but not all proposed types of downward causation are compatible with science. In particular, they find that constraint is one way in which downward causation can operate.&lt;ref&gt;P.B. Andersen, C. Emmeche, N.O. Finnemann, P.V. Christiansen, ''Downward Causation: Minds, Bodies and Matter'', Aarhus University Press ({{ISBN|87-7288-814-8}}) (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of causality as constraint has also been explored as a way to shed light on scientific concepts such as [[self-organization]], [[natural selection]], [[adaptation]], and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Einmag_Abstr/AJuarrero.html&amp;nbsp; |first1=A |last1=Juarrero |title=Causality as Constraint |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612013407/http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Einmag_Abstr/AJuarrero.html |archivedate=June 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free will===
{{main|Free will}}
Philosophers of the Enlightenment worked to insulate human free will from reductionism. [[Descartes]] separated the material world of mechanical necessity from the world of mental free will. German philosophers introduced the concept of the "[[Noumenon|noumenal]]" realm that is not governed by the deterministic laws of "[[Phenomena (philosophy)|phenomenal]]" nature, where every event is completely determined by chains of causality.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Guyer, "18th Century German Aesthetics," [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetics-18th-german/ ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']&lt;/ref&gt; The most influential formulation was by [[Immanuel Kant]], who distinguished between the causal deterministic framework the mind imposes on the world—the phenomenal realm—and the world as it exists for itself, the noumenal realm, which included free will. To insulate theology from reductionism, 19th century post-Enlightenment German theologians, especially [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] and [[Albrecht Ritschl]], used the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] method of basing religion on the human spirit, so that it is a person's feeling or sensibility about spiritual matters that comprises religion.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Clayton and Zachary Simpson, eds. ''The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Science'' (2006) p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antireductionism==
{{main|Antireductionism}}
The anti-reductionist considers as minimum requirement upon the reductionist: "At the very least the anti-reductionist is owed an account of why the intuitions arise if they are not accurate."&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Oxford Handbook of Causation |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGnZtUtG-nIC&amp;pg=PA292 |page=292 |author=John W Carroll |chapter=Chapter 13: Anti-reductionism |isbn=978-0199279739 |publisher=Oxford Handbooks Online |year=2009 |editor1=Helen Beebee |editor2=Christopher Hitchcock |editor3=Peter Menzies }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A contrast to reductionism is [[holism]] or [[emergentism]]. Holism is the idea that items can have properties, (emergent properties), as a whole that are not explainable from the sum of their parts. The principle of holism was summarized concisely by [[Aristotle]] in the [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]: "The whole is more than the sum of its parts".

The development of [[systems thinking]] has provided methods for describing issues in a [[holism|holistic]] rather than a reductionist way, and many scientists use a [[Holism in science|holistic paradigm]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dossey, Larry]]. ''Reinventing Medicine: Beyond Mind-Body to a New Era of Healing.'' ({{ISBN|0-06-251622-1}}) HarperSanFrancisco. (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; When the terms are used in a scientific context, holism and reductionism refer primarily to what sorts of [[scientific model|models]] or theories offer valid explanations of the natural world; the scientific method of falsifying hypotheses, checking empirical data against theory, is largely unchanged, but the method guides which theories are considered. The conflict between reductionism and holism in science is not universal—it usually concerns whether or not a holistic or reductionist method is appropriate in the context of studying a specific system or phenomenon.

In many cases (such as the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] of gases), given a good understanding of the components of the system, one can predict all the important properties of the system as a whole. In other systems{{which|date=August 2018}}, [[emergent properties]] of the system are said to be almost impossible to predict from knowledge of the parts of the system. [[Complex systems|Complexity theory]] studies systems and properties of the latter type.

[[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s metaphysics opposed reductionism. He refers to this as the "fallacy of the misplaced concreteness". His scheme was to frame a rational, general understanding of phenomena, derived from our reality.

[[Sven Erik Jorgensen]], an [[ecologist]], states both theoretical and practical arguments for a [[holistic]] method in certain topics of science, especially [[ecology]]. He argues that many systems are so complex that it will not ever be possible to describe all their details. Making an analogy to the Heisenberg [[uncertainty principle]] in physics, he argues that many interesting and relevant ecological phenomena cannot be replicated in laboratory conditions, and thus cannot be measured or observed without influencing and changing the system in some way. He also indicates the importance of interconnectedness in biological systems. His opinion is that science can only progress by outlining what questions are unanswerable and by using models that do not attempt to explain everything in terms of smaller hierarchical levels of organization, but instead model them on the scale of the system itself, taking into account some (but not all) factors from levels both higher and lower in the hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;S. E. Jørgensen, ''Integration of Ecosystem Theories: A Pattern'', 3rd ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, ({{ISBN|1-4020-0651-9}}) (2002) Chapters 1 &amp; 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cognitive psychology]], [[George Kelly (psychologist)|George Kelly]] developed "constructive alternativism" as a form of [[personal construct psychology]], this provided an alternative to what he considered "accumulative fragmentalism". For this theory, knowledge is seen as the construction of successful [[mental model]]s of the exterior world, rather than the accumulation of independent "nuggets of truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Pope ML, Watts M |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Constructivist Goggles: Implications for Process in Teaching and Learning Physics|journal=Eur. J. Physics|url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0143-0807/9/2/004|volume=9|pages=101–109|year=1988|doi=10.1088/0143-0807/9/2/004|issue=2|bibcode = 1988EJPh....9..101P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
''Fragmentalism'' is an alternative term for ontological reductionism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kukla A|title=Antirealist Explanations of the Success of Science|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=63|issue=1|pages=S298–S305|year=1996|doi=10.1086/289964|jstor=188539}}&lt;/ref&gt; although ''fragmentalism'' is frequently used in a [[pejorative]] sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pope ML|title=Personal construction of formal knowledge|journal=Interchange|url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/VQ4L33X920880824.pdf|volume=13|issue=4|pages=3–14|year=1982|doi=10.1007/BF01191417}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anti-realism|Anti-realists]] use the term fragmentalism in arguments that the world does not exist of separable [[entity|entities]], instead consisting of wholes. For example, advocates of this idea claim that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The linear deterministic approach to nature and technology promoted a fragmented perception of reality, and a loss of the ability to foresee, to adequately evaluate, in all their complexity, global crises in ecology, civilization and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~isre/NEWSLETTER/vol6no2/global.htm|title=Page Not Found|website=Indiana University Bloomington}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
The term "fragmentalism" is usually applied to reductionist modes of thought, frequently with the related pejorative term of ''[[scientism]]''. This usage is popular amongst some ecological activists: &lt;blockquote&gt;There is a need now to move away from [[scientism]] and the ideology of cause-and-effect determinism toward a radical [[empiricism]], such as [[William James]] proposed, as an [[epistemology]] of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioregionalanimism.blogspot.com/|title=Redirecting|website=bioregionalanimism.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; These perspectives are not new and during the early twentieth century, [[William James]] noted that rationalist science emphasized what he termed fragmentation and disconnection.&lt;ref name=Lumpkin/&gt;

Such opinions also motivate many criticisms of the scientific method: 
&lt;blockquote
&gt;The scientific method only acknowledges monophasic consciousness. The method is a specialized system that emphasizes studying small and distinctive parts in isolation, which results in fragmented knowledge.&lt;ref name=Lumpkin&gt;[http://www.bioregionalanimism.com/2006/12/is-polyphasic-consciousness-necessary.html Tara W. Lumpkin, ''Perceptual Diversity: Is Polyphasic Consciousness Necessary for Global Survival?'' December 28, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Sea Monsters''''' is a 2003 [[BBC]] television [[trilogy]] which used [[computer-generated imagery]] to show past life in Earth's seas. In the U.S. it was known as '''''Chased by Sea Monsters'''''. It was made by [[Impossible Pictures]],  the creators of ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'', ''[[Walking with Beasts]]'' and ''[[Walking with Monsters]]''. In the series, the British wildlife presenter [[Nigel Marven]] is shown traveling to seven past seas in the [[history of the Earth]] and [[scuba diving]] there, in order of dangerousness with the most dangerous last. He travels in a white [[sailboat]] or [[motorboat]] roughly 24&amp;nbsp;m (80&amp;nbsp;ft) long named 'The Ancient Mariner'. His [[time travel]]ling device is not mentioned or shown, and the closest thing to it is his time map, showing the timeline of the seven deadliest seas and the creatures that lived at the time. He uses a [[scuba set]] with a [[fullface mask]] so he can talk [[underwater]] to produce the commentary. He performs some dives using a strong [[shark cage]], which is spherical to make it harder for large sea creatures to bite it.

==Video release==
''Sea Monsters'' has never been released on DVD in the UK, but featured on the American ''[[Chased by Dinosaurs]]'' DVD and a similar [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] Dutch DVD. It was also available on [[Netflix]] in the UK and the United States, where it is referred to as Episode 2 of "Chased By Dinosaurs: Three Walking with Dinosaurs Adventures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMDB|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/prehistoric_life/dinosaurs/seamonsters/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Episodes ==
As originally broadcast, the first episode had three segments and the second and third two each; a format later inherited by ''[[Walking with Monsters]]''

 |Aux1=The [[Ordovician]]
 |Aux2=450 mya
 |Aux3=Giant Orthocones, Sea Scorpions
 |ShortSummary= [[New York (state)|New York]] in the [[Ordovician]]: the day is only 21 hours long and there is more [[carbon dioxide]] than in the 21st century, forcing Nigel to don a medical-looking backpack filled with air tanks with a special oxygen mixture. To attract a ''[[Megalograptus]]'' (1 m), Nigel finds the corpse of a dead [[Astraspis]] washed up on the beach. Because there is no land life, there are no coastal scavengers to eat what the sea spits out. Before long, Nigel wades into the shallow water and the armor-plated fish attracts a large ''Megalograptus''. The creature devours the armor-plated fish, before attacking Nigel's foot, cutting it badly.

Later on, Nigel attempts to go after a ''[[Cameroceras]]'' (9 m) by removing the eye of a dead [[Isotelus]] and replacing it with a small video camera. He then uses the inflatable raft to venture out into the deeper waters, where he throws the trilobite video camera combo overboard. However, a ''Megalograptus'' is quickly attracted to it, and Nigel immediately gets it off the trilobite. Later in the afternoon, a ''Cameroceras'' grabs and eats the trilobite, and Nigel and the cameraman plunge overboard to film it. On the dive, Nigel wears a chain mail suit, so that any marauding sea scorpion cannot harm him. He finds the ''Cameroceras'' and, after deterring it from attacking him by shining a torch in its eyes, he watches it devour two ''Megalograptus''. The ''Cameroceras'' is agiler in the sea than Nigel, and as it attempts to swim away, Nigel grabs onto its shell. When the ''Cameroceras'' starts to dive down into the depths, Nigel swims away to the surface, almost getting attacked by another ''Megalograptus''. When Nigel pilots the boat back to shore, he finds a surprise: there are large numbers of ''Megalograptus'' mating in the shallow waters. Nigel manages to make his way safely through the ''Megalograptus'' hordes, but a few clamber onto the [[inflatable boat]] and puncture it.

 |Title=The Sixth Most Deadly Sea
 |Aux1=The [[Triassic]]
 |Aux2= 230 mya
 |Aux3=Nothosaurs, Cymbospondylus
 |ShortSummary= As Nigel walks along the tropical coastlines of Triassic [[Switzerland]], he explains that the reptiles are taking over the surface of the earth from the skies (e.g. ''[[Peteinosaurus]]'' (1 m)), to the land (e.g. ''[[Coelophysis]]'' (2 m)). But of course, he is here to see the earliest sea reptiles.

From the deck of the ''Ancient Mariner'', Nigel and crew watch as a ''[[Nothosaurus]]'' (3 m) comes up for air. When he sees one, Nigel dives into the seas, pursuing the elusive sea reptile.

Before long, Nigel finds a pair of ''Nothosaurus''. The ''Nothosaurus'' circle him, and Nigel has his prod ready to put off any ''Nothosaurus'' that comes too close. One of the ''Nothosaurus'' moves in closer, so Nigel grabs it around its head to swim with it, explaining that although the ''Nothosaurus'' would be able to close its jaws with tremendous force, the muscles that open its jaws are very weak. He lets the ''Nothosaurus'' go discovers another bizarre sea reptile: a ''[[Tanystropheus]]'' (4 m).

Nigel follows the female ''Tanystropheus'', and attempts to get a closer look at her by grabbing onto her tail, impeding her movement. The ''Tanystropheus'' struggles with all of her might, but Nigel still had a grip on her tail. However, the ''Tanystropheus'' loses her tail, similar to the modern day [[leopard gecko]]. Nigel can hold onto the tail only with difficulty because it is thrashing around (intended as a predator decoy). Suddenly the tail is snatched up and then eaten by a ''[[Cymbospondylus]]'' (9 m).

The ''Cymbospondylus'' begins to circle Nigel, and he explains that its slow movement is designed to deceive prey, and it can move very quickly when it is needed to. After he pokes it with the prod several times, the ''Cymbospondylus'' swims away, and Nigel returns to the relative safety of the ''Ancient Mariner''.

 |Title=  The Fifth  Most Deadly Sea
 |Aux1=The [[Devonian]]
 |Aux2=360 mya
 |Aux3=Dunkleosteus
 |ShortSummary=On a preliminary dive, another crew member of the ''Mariner'' (Mike) films a huge female ''[[Dunkleosteus]]'' (9 m), swimming around the shallow reefs near the ''Ancient Mariner''. The crew springs into action, and Nigel goes fishing for ''[[Bothriolepis]]'' (30cm). Nigel places a bet with one of the other crew members that the ''Dunkleosteus'' will be able to slice through the ''Bothriolepis'' wrapped in chain mail. When the round shark cage is fully assembled, Nigel descends into it. The smell of the dead ''Bothriolepis'' begins to attract a young ''[[Stethacanthus]]'' (70cm). Eventually, the monstrous ''Dunkleosteus'' is sighted, which scares away the ''Stethacanthus'', and the enraged fish repeatedly bashes the cage with its thick head. The episode ends on a cliffhanger as the ''Dunkleosteus'' comes straight at the cage.

In the next episode, "Into the Jaws of Death", the ''Dunkleosteus'' indeed rams the cage, though only putting dents into it. Eventually, the ''Dunkleosteus'' snatches the ''Bothriolepis'' out of the cage (and almost rips Nigel's arm off in doing so), and slices through the bait, chainmail and all. A young ''Dunkleosteus'' (1 m) feeds on the remains, but the huge adult turns cannibal and devours the young ''Dunkleosteus''. She then regurgitates the indigestible parts of its meal (the armor plating and the chainmail).

Before all this, Nigel explains that the [[placoderm]]s as a whole have a grim future ahead of them. After thriving for fifty million years, the entire [[Class (biology)|Class]] of placoderms will disappear, much to the other Devonian fish's relief.

 |Title=  The Fourth  Most Deadly Sea
 |Aux1=The [[Eocene]]
 |Aux2=36 mya
 |Aux3=Basilosaurus
 |ShortSummary=While walking in the mangrove swamps of Egypt, Nigel comes across some mysterious footprints and a mound of fresh dung, by smelling the manure, he proves that the owner is a fruit-eater. Following the tracks, Nigel comes across an ''[[Arsinoitherium]]'' (3 m) migrating overland. Nigel takes a calculated risk and offers the huge fruit-eater an [[apple]], but apparently, this upsets the ''Arsinotherium'' and it charges at Nigel. Only by making a break into the thicker forests does Nigel escape from the mammal. Nigel watches from the forest as the ''Arsinoitherium'' plunges into the water, and follows it. In the water, Nigel watches as a trio of ''[[Dorudon]]'', a species of ancient [[whale]], pass by, and he explains that whales are the reason he came: not for the ''Dorudon'' (4 m), but a far bigger and meaner whale, ''[[Basilosaurus]]'' (15/24 m) who eats ''Dorudon'' for a meal.

The ''Ancient Mariner'' sails offshore, where the crew tries a tactic to attract whales that have been used with mixed success: record a ''Basilosaurus'' call and play it back via a huge speaker that is lowered from the boat. After playing it for a while, an enraged ''Basilosaurus'' (15 m) rams into the boat before diving again. Wasting no time, Nigel suits up and dives. However, the whale could attack from any direction, so Nigel stays close to the hull of the ''Mariner'', using the boat as a shield to ward off the ''Basilosaurus''. The ''Basilosaurus'' is evidently distressed by the calls, and attacks and disables the speaker (which is explained as a territorial response).

As the ''Ancient Mariner'' sails off forward through time, the narrator explains that the tropical Eocene is a world on the brink of great climatic change. As the Oligocene dawns, ''Basilosaurus'', ''Arsinoitherium'' and ''Dorudon'' will all vanish, victims of the climatic shifts that ended the [[Eocene]], changing the warm sea into a cold ocean and causing the Tethys Sea to disappear.

 |Aux3=Megalodon
 |ShortSummary=In the coast of Peru, the crew of the ''Mariner'' come to an agreement. Before diving in offshore waters with the adult ''[[Megalodon]]'' (15 m), Nigel will dive in the coastal waters, with the juveniles.

Before very long, Nigel finds an ''[[Odobenocetops]]'' (2 m) foraging for [[oysters]] in the mud, and it is being hunted by an adolescent ''Megalodon'' (6 m). Only by taking cover in the thick underwater foliage do Nigel and the Odobenocetops manage to escape the huge shark.

On the next dive (with the adults), Nigel uses the round [[shark cage]] that he previously used in the [[Devonian]] era against ''[[Dunkleosteus]]''. This time, Nigel hopes to fire a small video camera into the [[dorsal fin]] of the shark from the relative safety of the cage. Eventually, a ''Megalodon'' (15 m) is spotted, and Nigel quickly gets into the cage, while the crew sets up
bait (a bag of [[Chumming|chum]]), which quickly attracts the shark. As it attempts to attack the cage, Nigel tries to fire the camera.

However, Nigel panics, and never fires it. Later, he tries again, this time from the surface of the ''Mariner'', as the dorsal fin of the ''Megalodon'' was much too high to aim at. The shark is drawn again to the boat via liberal amounts of chum. The shark tries to grab the chum but Nigel is nowhere to be seen, ending the second episode on another cliffhanger.

In the final episode, "To Hell..... and Back?", it is revealed that Nigel has been knocked off the boat by the shark and when he swims back, he finally managed to land a hit with the
shark-camera, and the ''Megalodon'' grabs and swallows the chum. In a few days, they find the camera floating in the sea, and when they load it into the onboard television, they watch the ''Megalodon'' in question attack a ''[[Cetotherium]]''.

When the crew of the ''Ancient Mariner'' head backward in time, the narrator says that as the [[Ice Age]] begins, the whales that ''Megalodon'' preyed on migrated to colder waters, where ''Megalodon'' could not follow. ''Megalodon'' is doomed to extinction, by hunger.

 |Title=  The Second Most Deadly Sea
 |Aux1=The [[Jurassic]]
 |Aux2=155 mya
 |Aux3=Liopleurodon
 |ShortSummary=Set around England, which was then largely underwater. This is the second most dangerous sea. Hazards include ''[[Liopleurodon]]'' (25/28 m), the largest carnivorous animal of all time. Nigel spies a school of migrating ''[[Leedsichthys]]'' (25/28 m). One weaker one is lagging behind the school, and a native ''[[Metriorhynchus]]'' (3 m) and a foreign ''[[Hybodus]]'' (2 m) shark launch a joint attack. Using [[sonar]], Nigel discovers that a huge ''[[Liopleurodon]]'' (28 m) is heading toward the injured and dying ''Leedsichthys'' (28 m). The camera spots it circling the ''Leedsichthys'' which is already dead, though the ''Liopleurodon'' is eventually spooked away by the camera.

Nigel equips his and the cameraman's diving suit with a chemical system that will spray a cloud of deterrent similar to [[shark repellent]] at the huge pliosaur should they get too close. The crew uses huge waterproof lights when they descend to the corpse of the ''Leedsichthys'' because it is nighttime. A pair of ''Liopleurodon'' (every 18 m and 20 m) are feasting on the carcass, and Nigel starts to move closer toward them. When one turns its head towards him, Nigel panics and ejects the chemical, which works on the huge predator.

 |Title=  The  Most Deadly Sea Ever
 |Aux1=The [[Cretaceous]]
 |Aux2=75 mya
 |Aux3=Xiphactinus, Sharks, Giant Mosasaurs
 |ShortSummary=Nigel is now entering his final sea mission in "Hell's Aquarium" as he calls it. On the land, there's ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' (12 m), but even it can't compare to what's in the water. After viewing a colony of ''[[Hesperornis]]'' (2 m) on the coastline, Nigel and another member of the ''Mariner'' pause for a second to view a huge underwater bloodbath. As far as Nigel (using a [[periscope]]) can figure out, an elderly ''Hesperornis'' was killed, and the resulting carnage has attracted many sea animals, such as ''[[Squalicorax]]'' (5 m), and ''[[Xiphactinus]]'' (6 m). However, Nigel noticed another predator around: a mosasaur known as ''[[Halisaurus]]'' (5 m). Nigel and the crew head out to deeper water in search of ''[[Tylosaurus]]'' (14 m). But Nigel explains that this sea is far too dangerous to go diving in because of mosasaurs and other huge carnivores like ''Xiphactinus''. Instead, the crew of the ''Ancient Mariner'' has rigged an [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]] to dive for them, while the sonar and cameras on the side of the boat would give them early warning if any mosasaurs are nearby. While sailing they see a ''Tyrannosaurus'' roaring on land.

The next morning, Nigel discovers that they have hit a dead ''[[Archelon]]'' (2 m), which was mauled by some other predator before being hit by the boat. Later, after managing to domesticate a ''[[Pteranodon]]'' (6 m), the sonar picks up some creatures right beneath the boat. This was a good time for them to use the ROV, and when they send it down, the crew finds that it's a small pod of ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'' (10.3 m) riding their wake like 21st century [[dolphin]]s, but soon they depart due to the risk that they may provoke the herd. Some of them knocked the ROV when they were investigating it, and an ''Archelon'' (4 m) is also spotted. Having done the same thing with present-day [[leatherback turtles]], Nigel risks his personal safety to track down the ''Archelon'' and ride it. He and the cameraman ride off in the small inflatable raft.

Before long, Nigel finds the ''Archelon'' when it comes up to the surface for air. He dives, grabbing onto the huge turtle's shell. But not long after, the sonar picked up something nearby: a ''Xiphactinus'' was circling Nigel and the ''Archelon''. He quickly makes his escape back up to the raft, but disaster strikes. A family pod of ''Tylosaurus'' attack and completely overturn the raft, plunging the crew into the sea. Fortunately for Nigel, the ''Tylosaurus'' seem more interested in the boat than the humans, and they quickly escape back to the Mariner. However, that night, as the men sleep, several kinds of mosasaurs (3/14 m) appear, apparently attracted to the Mariner, and rush straight to the boat, leaving the crew's fate unknown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6188">A '''self-performed caesarean section''' is a form of [[self-surgery]] where a woman attempts to perform a [[caesarean section]] on herself.

Cases of self-inflicted caesarean section have been reported since the 18th and 19th century. While mostly deadly to either the mother, the child or both, there are at least five known documented successful cases.&lt;ref name="Szabo"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Szabó | first1 = András | last2 = Brockington | first2 = Ian | doi = 10.1007/s00737-013-0398-z | title = Auto-Caesarean section: a review of 22 cases | journal = Archives of Women's Mental Health | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 79–83 | year = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrison2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Morrison | first1 = J. | last2 = MacKenzie | first2 = I.

==Notable cases==

===Inés Ramírez Pérez===
In March 2000, Inés Ramírez Pérez, a [[Mexico|Mexican]] woman from the state of [[Oaxaca]], gained media attention after performing a [[Caesarean section]] on herself. Despite having no medical training, the operation was successful and both she and her baby survived.

At midnight, on 5 March 2000&amp;#160;– after 12 hours of continual pain, Ramírez sat down on a bench&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/06/01/1086037758224.html|title=True grit: the mum who delivered her own baby|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1 June 2004|accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and drank three small glasses of hard liquor.&lt;ref name="ijgo"&gt;{{cite journal   |author1=Molina-Sosa, A |author2=Galvan-Espinosa, H |author3=Gabriel-Guzman, J |author4=Valle, RF | title = Self-inflicted cesarean section with maternal and fetal survival    | journal = International Journal of Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics   | volume = 84   | issue = 3   | pages = 287–290   | year = 2004   | doi = 10.1016/j.ijgo.2003.08.018   | pmid=15001385 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She then used a {{convert|15|cm|in}}&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt; kitchen knife to cut open her abdomen in a total of three attempts.&lt;ref name="ijgo"/&gt; Ramírez cut through her skin in a {{convert|17|cm|in}}&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt; vertical line several centimeters to the right of her navel, starting near the bottom of the ribs and ending near the pubic area. (For comparison: a typical C-section incision is {{convert|10|cm|in}} long, horizontal and well below the navel, the so-called "[[Pfannenstiel incision]]".) After operating on herself for an hour, she reached inside her uterus and pulled out her baby boy.&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt; She then severed the umbilical cord with a pair of scissors and became unconscious.&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt; She used clothes to bandage her wound after regaining consciousness, and sent one of her older sons to find help.&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt;

Several hours later, the village health assistant and a second man found Ramírez conscious and alert, along with her live baby.&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt; He sewed her incision with an available needle and thread.&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt;

Ramírez was eventually taken to the local clinic, two and a half miles away in [[San Lorenzo Texmelucan]], and then to the nearest hospital, eight hours away by car. Sixteen hours thereafter she underwent surgical repair of the incision site. On the seventh post-operative day, she underwent a second surgery to repair complications resulting from damage to her intestines incurred during her C-section. She was released from the hospital on the tenth day post-surgery, and went on to make a complete recovery.

Describing her experience, Ramírez said, "I couldn’t stand the pain anymore. If my baby was going to die, then I decided I would have to die, too. But if he was going to grow up, I was going to see him grow up, and I was going to be with my child. I thought that God would save both our lives."&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt;

The case was written up in the March 2004 issue of the ''International Journal of Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics''.&lt;ref name="ijgo"/&gt;

She is also believed to have been profoundly lucky in several ways: to have put herself in the position she chose, which put her uterus&amp;#160;– rather than her intestines&amp;#160;– against the abdominal wall under the incision site; to have not succumbed to infection from the large open wound in a non-sterile environment; to have not passed out from the pain part-way through, bled to death, or died from shock. She did say, afterward, that she didn't advise other women to follow her example.&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the science fiction film ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'', by [[Ridley Scott]], the character Elizabeth Shaw gives herself a caesarean section. The scene has been discussed,&lt;ref name="mtv2012"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1686988/prometheus-surgery-scene.jhtml | title='Prometheus': Secrets Behind The Surgery Scene | work=MTV News | date=11 June 2012 | accessdate=24 August 2013 | author=Kevin P.

'''Temporal difference''' ('''TD''') '''learning''' refers to a class of model-free [[reinforcement learning]] methods which learn by [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrapping]] from the current estimate of the value function. These methods sample from the environment, like [[Monte Carlo method]]s, and perform updates based on current estimates, like [[dynamic programming]] methods.&lt;ref name="RSutton-1998"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/the-book.html|title=Reinforcement Learning|author1=Richard Sutton|author2=Andrew Barto|publisher=MIT Press|year=1998|isbn=0-585-02445-6|lastauthoramp=yes|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330005640/http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/the-book.html|archivedate=2017-03-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Monte Carlo methods only adjust their estimates once the final outcome is known, TD methods adjust predictions to match later, more accurate, predictions about the future before the final outcome is known.&lt;ref name="RSutton-1988"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Richard Sutton |title=Learning to predict by the methods of temporal differences |journal=Machine Learning |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=9–44 |year=1988 |doi=10.1007/BF00115009}} (A revised version is available on [http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/publications.html Richard Sutton's publication page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330002227/http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/publications.html |date=2017-03-30 }})&lt;/ref&gt; This is a form of [[bootstrapping]], as illustrated with the following example:

:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Suppose you wish to predict the weather for Saturday, and you have some model that predicts Saturday's weather, given the weather of each day in the week. In the standard case, you would wait until Saturday and then adjust all your models. However, when it is, for example, Friday, you should have a pretty good idea of what the weather would be on Saturday - and thus be able to change, say, Saturday's model before Saturday arrives."&lt;ref name="RSutton-1988" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Mathematical formulation ==
The tabular TD(0) method, one of the simplest TD methods, estimates the state value function of a finite-state [[Markov decision process]] (MDP) under a policy &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;V^\pi&lt;/math&gt; denote the state value function of the MDP with states &lt;math&gt;(s_t)_{t\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt;, rewards &lt;math&gt;(r_t)_{t\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; and discount rate &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; under the policy &lt;math&gt; \pi &lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;V^\pi(s) = E_{\pi}\left\{\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^tr_t\Bigg|  s_0=s\right\}.
&lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;math&gt;V^\pi&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the [[Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation|Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation]]: 
: &lt;math&gt;V^\pi(s)=E_{\pi}\{r_0 + \gamma V^\pi(s_1)|s_0=s\},&lt;/math&gt;

so &lt;math&gt;r_0 + \gamma V^\pi(s_1)&lt;/math&gt; is an unbiased estimate for &lt;math&gt;V^\pi(s)&lt;/math&gt;. This observation motivates the following algorithm for estimating &lt;math&gt;V^\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

The algorithm starts by initializing a table &lt;math&gt;V(s)&lt;/math&gt; arbitrarily, with one value for each state of the MDP. A positive learning rate &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is chosen.

We then repeatedly evaluate the policy &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, obtain a reward &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and update the value function for the old state using the rule:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reinforcement learning: An introduction|url=http://people.inf.elte.hu/lorincz/Files/RL_2006/SuttonBook.pdf|page=130|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712170739/http://people.inf.elte.hu/lorincz/Files/RL_2006/SuttonBook.pdf|archivedate=2017-07-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; V(s) \leftarrow V(s) + \alpha(\overbrace{r + \gamma V(s')}^{\text{The TD target}} - V(s) )&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s'&lt;/math&gt;are the old and new states, respectively.

The value &lt;math&gt; r + \gamma V(s')&lt;/math&gt; is known as the TD target.

== TD-Lambda ==
'''TD-Lambda''' is a learning algorithm invented by [[Richard S. Sutton]] based on earlier work on temporal difference learning by [[Arthur Samuel]].&lt;ref name="RSutton-1998" /&gt; This algorithm was famously applied by [[Gerald Tesauro]] to create [[TD-Gammon]], a program that learned to play the game of [[backgammon]] at the level of expert human players.&lt;ref name="CACM"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Temporal Difference Learning and TD-Gammon|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=March 1995|first=Gerald|last=Tesauro|volume=38|issue=3|pages=|id= |url=http://www.research.ibm.com/massive/tdl.html|accessdate=2010-02-08 | doi= 10.1145/203330.203343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lambda (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) parameter refers to the trace decay parameter, with &lt;math&gt;0 \le \lambda \le 1&lt;/math&gt;. Higher settings lead to longer lasting traces; that is, a larger proportion of credit from a reward can be given to more distant states and actions when &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is higher, with &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 1&lt;/math&gt; producing parallel learning to Monte Carlo RL algorithms.

== TD algorithm in neuroscience ==
The TD [[algorithm]] has also received attention in the field of [[neuroscience]]. Researchers discovered that the firing rate of [[dopamine]] [[neurons]] in the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA) and [[substantia nigra]] (SNc) appear to mimic the error function in the algorithm.&lt;ref name="WSchultz-1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The error function reports back the difference between the estimated reward at any given state or time step and the actual reward received. The larger the error function, the larger the difference between the expected and actual reward. When this is paired with a stimulus that accurately reflects a future reward, the error can be used to associate the stimulus with the future [[reward system|reward]].

[[Dopamine]] cells appear to behave in a similar manner. In one experiment measurements of dopamine cells were made while training a monkey to associate a stimulus with the reward of juice.&lt;ref name="WSchultz-1998"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schultz, W. |year=1998 |title=Predictive reward signal of dopamine neurons |journal=Journal of Neurophysiology |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the dopamine cells increased firing rates when the monkey received juice, indicating a difference in expected and actual rewards. Over time this increase in firing back propagated to the earliest reliable stimulus for the reward. Once the monkey was fully trained, there was no increase in firing rate upon presentation of the predicted reward. Continually, the firing rate for the dopamine cells decreased below normal activation when the expected reward was not produced. This mimics closely how the error function in TD is used for [[reinforcement learning]].

The relationship between the model and potential neurological function has produced research attempting to use TD to explain many aspects of behavioral research.&lt;ref name="PDayan-2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dayan, P. |year=2001 |title=Motivated reinforcement learning |journal=Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems |volume=14 |pages=11–18 |publisher=MIT Press |url=http://books.nips.cc/papers/files/nips14/CS01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used to study conditions such as [[schizophrenia]] or the consequences of pharmacological manipulations of dopamine on learning.&lt;ref name="ASmith-2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith, A., Li, M., Becker, S. and Kapur, S. |year=2006 |title=Dopamine, prediction error, and associative learning: a model-based account |journal=Network: Computation in Neural Systems |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=61–84 |doi=10.1080/09548980500361624 |pmid=16613795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Terje Aa''' (born 16 March 1961) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[contract bridge|bridge]] player, WBF World Life Master, and regular member of the Norwegian team since 1993. Teams on which he was a member have placed in the top three of the [[World Bridge Federation]] European and World Championships 11 times between 1984 and 2008.

In 1993, Aa debuted as the member of Norwegian national selection and won the Schiphol Invitational Teams in [[Netherlands]] and bronze medal in European Teams Championship in [[Menton]], France. In the same year, they reached the final of [[Bermuda Bowl]] in [[Santiago de Chile]], where they lost to the young Dutch team. In 1997, they again won the European bronze medal and lost to France in the Bermuda Bowl semifinals, held in [[Tunis]], ending up third by defeating the [[United States]] for the bronze. The same team earned the European silver in the [[Tenerife]] in 2001 finishing behind Italy.

Aa works for the Norwegian Post Office. His regular partner between 1993 and 2006 was [[Glenn Grøtheim]] playing the "Viking [[Precision Club|Precision]]", a [[relay bid|relay-based system]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last1 = Grøtheim  |first1 = Glenn  |authorlink1 = Glenn Grøtheim  |last2 = Sontag  |first2 = Alan  |authorlink2 = Alan Sontag   |title = The Viking Precision Club - A Relay System for the 21st Century  |edition =   |publisher = Devyn Press, Inc  |location = Louisville, KY  |pages =   |series =  |year = 2000  |doi =  |lccn =  |oclc =  |isbn = 0-939460-27-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Thomas Tsunetomi Noguchi'''|野口 恒富|Noguchi Tsunetomi|extra=born January 4, 1927}} is a former Chief [[Medical Examiner]]-[[Coroner]] for the [[County of Los Angeles]], who served in that position from 1967 to 1982. Known as the "coroner to the stars", he determined the cause of death in many high-profile cases during the 1960s and 1970s. He is most famous for performing autopsies on [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Robert F. Kennedy]], [[Sharon Tate]], [[Gia Scala]], [[William Holden]], [[Natalie Wood]], and [[John Belushi]].

==Career==
Noguchi was born in Japan and graduated from [[Tokyo]]'s [[Nippon Medical School]] in 1951 before interning at The [[University of Tokyo]] School of Medicine Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Robert |first1=Lindsey |title=MAN IN THE NEWS; A CHASTISED 'CORNER TO THE STARS' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/12/us/man-in-the-news-a-chastised-corner-to-the-stars.html |date=March 12, 1982 |website=The New York Times |publisher=Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Sr. |accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter he immigrated to the United States. He then served a second internship at Orange County General Hospital and a series of residencies at [[Loma Linda University]] School of Medicine, and Barlow Sanatorium in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thomas T. Noguchi Receives the R.B.H. Gradwohl Medallion |date=April 2, 2015 |url=https://news.aafs.org/aafs-news/thomas-t-noguchi-receives-the-r-b-h-gradwohl-medallion/ |website=American Academy of Forensic Sciences |accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was appointed a deputy coroner for [[Los Angeles County]] in 1961.

In 1967, he became Chief Medical Examiner (CME) for the county, replacing his mentor [[Theodore Curphey]]. As CME, Noguchi came to public attention for a series of [[Autopsy|autopsies]]; which he performed or supervised on a range of celebrities and public figures that included [[Albert Dekker]], [[Robert F. Kennedy]], [[Sharon Tate]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Inger Stevens]], [[Gia Scala]], [[David Janssen]], [[William Holden]], [[Natalie Wood]], and [[John Belushi]].  His autopsy of Kennedy is significant for its conclusion that the fatal shot was fired into the back of Kennedy's head, behind the right ear, from an upward angle, and from a distance of no more than 0.5 to 3 inches (15–75 mm) away. Such a finding has given rise to [[Robert F.

He developed a high profile as CME, and was often accused of speaking too freely to the media, particularly following the November 1981 deaths of [[William Holden]] and [[Natalie Wood]], which, along with moonlighting and alleged mismanagement, led to his demotion from coroner to physician specialist in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Noguchi Begins New Job|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19820429&amp;id=ZoZhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bOQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6580,5716558|accessdate=October 16, 2013|newspaper=Reading Eagle|date=April 29, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later appointed Chief of Pathology at the [[University of Southern California]] and then as Administrative Pathologist for Anatomic Pathology services at the [[Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center|USC Medical Center]].

'''Vostok 2''' ({{lang-ru|'''Восток-2'''}}, ''[[Orient]] 2'' or ''East 2'') was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] space mission which carried [[astronaut|cosmonaut]] [[Gherman Titov]] into orbit for a full day on August 6, 1961 to study the effects of a more prolonged period of [[weightlessness]] on the human body.&lt;ref name="flightmag_17aug" /&gt;  Titov orbited the Earth over 17 times, exceeding the single orbit of [[Yuri Gagarin]] on [[Vostok 1]] − as well as the suborbital spaceflights of [[United States of America|American]] astronauts [[Alan Shepard]] and [[Gus Grissom]] aboard their respective [[Mercury-Redstone 3]] and [[Mercury-Redstone 4|4]] missions. Indeed, Titov's number of orbits and flight time would not be surpassed by an American astronaut until [[Gordon Cooper|Gordon Cooper's]] [[Mercury-Atlas 9]] spaceflight in May 1963.

After the flight of Vostok 1, [[Sergei Korolev]] took a short vacation in Crimea where he began working out the flight plan for the next mission. There were considerable arguments over the duration of the mission as flight doctors argued for no more than three orbits. The flight of [[Korabl-Sputnik 2]] nine months earlier had carried two dogs on a six orbit mission, during which the animals had experienced convulsions and thus all subsequent Vostok missions were limited to three orbits maximum. Although dogs and humans were very different physiologically, the doctors were worried about the risks posed on a longer flight. There was also the purely practical aspect of spacecraft recovery. If Vostok 2 flew three orbits, reentry and landing would take place in the wide open steppes of southern Russia, the landing site moving steadily further west with each orbit. Orbits 8-13 would drop the capsule into the [[Pacific Ocean]], after which landing would again occur in Soviet territory, but in the remote, frozen wastes of [[Siberia]]. Thus, it was necessary to spend a full 24 hours in space before it would be once again possible to land in the prime recovery area in southern Russia. The three orbit limit thus would not only make landing easy, but minimize risks to the cosmonaut posed by prolonged weightlessness.

Korolev argued that since it would still take an entire day for landing in southern Russia to be possible again, there was no reason not to go for it. Besides, he argued, missions of the future would inevitably require lengthy stays in space. The flight was targeted for somewhere between July 25 and August 5. To ensure safe radiation levels, balloons equipped with [[Geiger counter]]s were flown aloft, in addition similar equipment would be carried on Vostok 2. Several enhancements were made to Vostok 2, including an improved TV transmission system and better climate control systems.

Liftoff took place August 6 at 8:57 AM Moscow time and booster performance was almost flawless, placing the spacecraft into a 184x244 km orbit.

The flight was an almost complete success, marred only by a heater that had inadvertently been turned off prior to liftoff and that allowed the inside temperature to drop to {{convert|50|°F|°C}},&lt;ref name=silentsea&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Into That Silent Sea|Into That Silent Sea: Trailblazers of the Space Era, 1961-1965]] |year=2007 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, Nebr. |isbn= 978-0-8032-1146-9 |oclc=71210133 |author= [[Francis French]]; [[Colin Burgess (author)|Colin Burgess]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|113}} a bout of [[space sickness]], and a troublesome re-entry when the [[reentry module]] failed to separate cleanly from its [[service module]].&lt;ref name="svengrahn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/histind/Vostok2/vostok2.html |title=The flight of Vostok-2 |accessdate=2009-03-12 |last=Grahn |first=Sven |work=Sven's Space Place}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Yuri Gagarin on Vostok 1, Titov took manual control of the spacecraft for a short while. Another change came when the Soviets admitted that Titov did not land with his spacecraft. Titov would claim in an interview that he ejected from his capsule as a test of an alternative landing system; it is now known that all [[Vostok program]] landings were performed this way.&lt;ref name="flightmag_17aug" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nasa_partners"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ezell, Edward Clinton |author2=Ezell, Linda Neuman |year=1978 |title=The Partnership: A History of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project |journal=NASA History Series |issue=NASA Special Publication-4209 |publisher=NASA |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4209/ch3-4.htm |accessdate=2009-03-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823124845/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4209/ch3-4.htm|archivedate=2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The re-entry capsule was destroyed during development of the [[Voskhod spacecraft]].&lt;ref name=silentsea/&gt;{{rp|117}}

As of 2017, Titov remains the youngest person to reach space.

==Mission highlights==

Gherman Titov launched from [[Gagarin's Start]] at [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] on 6 August 1961 at 06:00 UTC aboard the Vostok 2 [[space capsule]]. Radio personality [[Yuri Levitan]] interrupted [[Radio Moscow]] programming with an announcement of the flight at 07:45 UTC.&lt;ref name="svengrahn" /&gt;

Nausea set in after Titov achieved [[weightlessness|free fall]] in orbit, causing him to vomit when he tried to eat one of his planned meals. Soviet space program officials suspected disturbance of Titov's [[vestibular system]] was to blame, leading them to begin early investigations into what is now known as [[space adaptation syndrome]], or space sickness. Titov is believed to be the first spacefarer to experience the condition.&lt;ref name="svengrahn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="flightmag_6sept"&gt;{{cite journal |date=6 September 1962|title="Group Space Flight" Described − Part 2 |journal=[[Flight International|Flight]] |issue=2791 |volume=82 |pages=389–391 |publisher=Iliffe Transport Publications |location=London |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1962/1962%20-%201887.html |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oman |first1=Charles M. |last2=Lichtenburg |first2=Byron K. |last3=Money |first3=Kenneth E. |editor-last=Crampton |editor-first=George |title=Motion and Space Sickness |edition=illustrated |date=17 January 1990 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=0-8493-4703-3 |page=218 |chapter=Symptoms and Signs of Space Motion Sickness on SPACELAB-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Vostok2-Pin.jpg|left|thumb|Commemorative pin from Vostok 2 Mission]]Titov took manual control of the capsule's [[attitude dynamics and control|attitude]] for a time as he passed over Africa on his first orbit and would again at the end of the seventh orbit; the controls were reported to function well. Titov exchanged greetings with Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] as he passed over the Soviet Union at the end of his first orbit, replicating Gagarin's feat.&lt;ref name="flightmag_17aug" /&gt;&lt;ref name="svengrahn" /&gt; During his flight the first manual photographs were taken from orbit, thus setting a record for modern [[space photography]]. He also was the first person to film the Earth using, for ten minutes, a professional quality Konvas-Avtomat movie camera.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaAstronautica"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.astronautix.com/astros/titov.htm |publisher= Encyclopedia Astronautica |title= Titov |accessdate= 18 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pictures"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.postiar.com/post/24107/the-first-pictures-of-earth-marks-50-years.html |title=  The first pictures of Earth marks 50 years  |accessdate= 18 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A camera aboard the capsule transmitted smiling pictures of Titov to the ground as he passed over Soviet territory on the fifth orbit.  Titov settled down to sleep during the seventh orbit; he awoke over eight hours later, 37 minutes after the scheduled end of his sleep period.&lt;ref name="flightmag_17aug" /&gt; Sleep did not relieve Titov's serious discomfort; he still felt very ill after awaking. After 12 orbits Titov suddenly began to recover, and became "completely functional and fully fit".&lt;ref name=siddiqi2000&gt;{{cite book | last = Siddiqi | first = Asif A. | url = https://history.nasa.gov/printFriendly/series95.html | title = Challenge To Apollo: The Soviet Union and the Space Race, 1945-1974 | publisher = [[NASA]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008193942/https://history.nasa.gov/printFriendly/series95.html|archivedate=2006-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|293–294}}

Detailed information about the radio frequencies used by the spacecraft were made public before Titov's flight; listening posts around the world picked up voice and telemetry signals from Vostok 2, allaying suspicions that the spaceflight might have been faked.&lt;ref name="svengrahn" /&gt;

As on Vostok 1, the Vostok 2 service module failed to detach from the reentry module when commanded and [[Atmospheric reentry|reentry]] began with the former still attached; the conjoined modules gyrated violently until [[aerodynamic heating]] burned through the straps still holding them together. Titov ejected from the capsule as planned and parachuted separately to land at 0718 UTC on 7 August 1961, near [[Krasny Kut, Saratov Oblast]].&lt;ref name="svengrahn" /&gt;Just prior to ejecting, Titov turned his head to look at something and so got his face rammed into his helmet at ejection, giving himself a bloody nose.

The Vostok 2 landing site coordinates are {{coord|50.85276|N|47.02048|E}}, which is 11.5&amp;nbsp;km South of Krasny Kut, Saratovskaya oblast in the Russian Federation. At the roadside site are two monuments dedicated to the Vostok 2 mission. The larger one is a 9 meter tall, silver painted stone sculpture, that resembles a single bird's wing pointed skyward. The center of the wing has a series of looping openings, one atop the next, that resemble a row of feathers. To the right of the wing sculpture is a 2 meter high, silver painted square stone block, with a rounded corner on the front side. A portrait of Titov, wearing a space helmet, is on one side of the stone block, the other side contains red painted text commemorating the mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://maps.google.com/maps?t=h&amp;lci=org.wikipedia.en&amp;q=50.85276,47.02048(Vostok+2)&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=50.852789,47.020562&amp;spn=0.006651,0.020707&amp;z=16 |title = Google Maps - Vostok 2 Landing Site - Monument Location|accessdate = 2010-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=50.85375,47.021334&amp;spn=0.006651,0.020707&amp;t=k&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=lyrftr:com.panoramio.all,1711661006741655857,50.852287,47.020454&amp;lci=com.panoramio.all |title = Google Maps - Vostok 2 Landing Site - Monument Photo|accessdate = 2010-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=50.852287,47.020454&amp;spn=0,0.020707&amp;t=k&amp;z=16&amp;lci=com.panoramio.all&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=50.852287,47.020454&amp;cbp=12,0,,0,5&amp;photoid=po-3476203 |title = Google Maps - Vostok 2 Landing Site - Monument Photo closeup|accessdate = 2010-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the Vostok 2 capsule was reused as a ballast weight in a test of an experimental parachute system planned for the ''Voskhod'' capsule.  The prototype malfunctioned, shattering Vostok 2 into tiny pieces.&lt;ref name=silentsea/&gt;{{rp|117}}

'''Vostok 6''' ({{lang-ru|'''Восток-6'''}}, ''[[Orient]] 6'' or ''East 6'') was the first [[human spaceflight]] to carry a woman, [[astronaut|cosmonaut]] [[Valentina Tereshkova]], into space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = 1963: Soviets launch first woman into space|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/16/newsid_2685000/2685283.stm|newspaper = BBC|date = 1963-06-16|access-date = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The spacecraft was launched on June 16, 1963. While Vostok 5 had been delayed by technical problems, Vostok 6's launch proceeded with no difficulties. Data collected during the mission provided better understanding of the female body's reaction to spaceflight. Like other cosmonauts on Vostok missions, Tereshkova maintained a flight log, took photographs, and manually oriented the spacecraft. Her photographs of the horizon from space were later used to identify aerosol layers within the atmosphere. The mission, a joint flight with [[Vostok 5]], was originally conceived as being a joint mission with two Vostoks each carrying a female cosmonaut, but this changed as the Vostok program experienced cutbacks as a precursor to the retooling of the program into the [[Voskhod program]]. Vostok 6 was the last flight of a [[Vostok 3KA]] spacecraft.

The Soviet state television network broadcast live video of Tereshkova from a camera inside the capsule, and she conversed with Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] over the radio. Communications with ground controllers about her overall health were described in post-flight reports as "evasive", and later official accounts of the mission had somewhat condescending remarks about Tereshkova's overall in-flight performance.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

In Tereshkova's account of the mission in her postflight debriefing, she mentioned having assorted body pains and difficulty with her helmet headset (also reported by Bykovsky on Vostok 5). She vomited while attempting to eat, although she attributed this to the taste of the food rather than her physical condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vostok 6|url = http://www.astronautix.com/flights/vostok6.htm|website = www.astronautix.com|accessdate = 2015-11-28|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131108102000/http://www.astronautix.com/flights/vostok6.htm|archivedate = 2013-11-08|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An official history of the Soviet space program published in 1973 described Tereshkova's physical condition and in-flight performance as "udovletvoritelnoe" (adequate) rather than "otlichno" (good or outstanding).{{cn|date=January 2018}}

It was revealed in 2004 that an error in the control program made the spaceship ascend from orbit instead of descending. Tereshkova noticed the fault on the first day of the flight and reported it to spaceship designer [[Sergey Korolev]]. Flight controllers then provided Tereshkova with data to enter into the descent program.&lt;ref name="First Woman Cosmonaut..."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.com/p-10235/Vostok-6_error/|title=World First Woman Cosmonaut Speaks About Error of Vostok Designers |work=Kommersant|date=2 March 2007|accessdate=2013-06-16|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304081938/http://www.kommersant.com/p-10235/Vostok-6_error/|archivedate=4 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By request of Korolev, Tereshkova kept the problem secret. "I kept silent, but [[Yevgeny Khrunov|Evgeny Vasilievich]] decided to make it public. So, I can easily talk about it now."&lt;ref name="First Woman Cosmonaut..."/&gt;

The Vostok 6 landing site coordinates are {{Coord|53.209375|N|80.80395|E}}, 200&amp;nbsp;km West of [[Barnaul]], Altai, in the Russian Federation and 7&amp;nbsp;km south of Baevo, and 650&amp;nbsp;km North East of [[Karagandy]], [[Kazakhstan]]. At the site, in a small park at the roadside, is a statue of Tereshkova, with arms outstretched, at the top of a curved column.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=53.209425,80.804427&amp;spn=0,0.004324&amp;t=k&amp;z=18&amp;lci=com.panoramio.all&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=53.209425,80.804427&amp;cbp=12,0,,0,5&amp;photoid=po-25974536

The capsule is now on display at the [[RKK Energia Museum]] in [[Korolyov (city)|Korolyov]] (near [[Moscow]]). From September 2015 it formed part of the content of the "Cosmonauts" exhibition at the [[Science Museum, London]]. The Exhibition featured many iconic objects from the Soviet space program.

This was the final [[Vostok spacecraft|Vostok]] flight.

A '''worst-case scenario''' is a concept in [[risk management]] wherein the planner, in planning for potential [[disaster]]s, considers the most severe possible outcome that can reasonably be projected to occur in a given situation. Conceiving of worst-case scenarios is a common form of [[strategic planning]], specifically [[scenario planning]], to prepare for and minimize contingencies that could result in [[accident]]s, [[Quality assurance|quality]] problems, or other issues.

==Development and use==
The worst-case scenario is "[o]ne of the most commonly used alternative scenarios".&lt;ref name="Yoe"&gt;Charles Yoe, ''Principles of Risk Analysis: Decision Making Under Uncertainty'' (2011), p. 429-30.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[risk manager]] may request "a conservative risk estimate representing a worst-case scenario" in order to determine the latitude they may exercise in planning steps to reduce risks.&lt;ref name="Cheremisinoff"&gt;Nicholas P. Cheremisinoff, ''Environmental Technologies Handbook'' (2005), page 73-74.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, a worst-case scenario "is settled upon by agreeing that a given worst case is bad enough. However, it is important to recognize that no worst-case scenario is truly without potential nasty surprises".&lt;ref name="Dewar"&gt;James A. Dewar, ''Assumption-Based Planning: A Tool for Reducing Avoidable Surprises'' (2002), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, "[a] “worst-case scenario” is never the worst case",&lt;ref&gt;Alexander M. Ineichen, ''Asymmetric Returns: The Future of Active Asset Management'' (2011), Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt; both because situations may arise that no planner could reasonably foresee,&lt;ref name="Yoe"/&gt; and because a given worst-case scenario is likely to consider only contingencies expected to arise in connection with a particular disaster. The worst-case scenario devised by a seismologist might be a particularly bad earthquake, and the worst-case scenario devised by a meteorologist might be a particularly bad hurricane, but it is unlikely that either of them will devise a scenario where a particularly bad storm occurs at the same time as a particularly bad earthquake.

The definition of a worst-case scenario varies by the field to which it is being applied. For example, in [[environmental engineering]]", "[a] worst-case scenario is defined as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint".&lt;ref&gt;Ashok Naimpally, Kirsten Rosselot, ''Environmental Engineering: Review for the Professional Engineering Examination'' (2013), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; In this field, "[a]s in other fields, the worst-case scenario is a useful device when low probability events may result in a catastrophe that must be avoided even at great cost, but in most health risk assessments, a worst-case scenario is essentially a type of bounding estimate".&lt;ref name="Cheremisinoff"/&gt; In [[computer science]], the [[best, worst, and average case]] of a given algorithm express what the resource usage is at least, at most and on average, respectively. For many individuals, a worst case scenario is one that would result in their own death.&lt;ref name="Annas"&gt;George J. Annas, ''Worst Case Bioethics: Death, Disaster, and Public Health'' (2010), p. xi-xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
A number of criticisms have been leveled against the use of worst-case scenarios.&lt;ref name="Yoe"/&gt; In some cases, a conceivable worst-case scenario within a field may be so far beyond the capacity of participants to deal with that it is not worth the effort to develop or explore such a scenario; where this is possible, it is "important to evaluate whether the development of a worst-case scenario is reasonable and desirable".&lt;ref&gt;Betty Biringer, Eric Vugrin, Drake Warren, ''Critical Infrastructure System Security and Resiliency'' (2013), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Entities that rely on such scenarios in planning may be led to plan too conservatively to take advantage of the usual absence of such scenarios, and may waste resources preparing for highly unlikely contingencies.&lt;ref name="Yoe"/&gt; At the extreme, it has been argued that the use of worst-case scenarios in disaster preparedness and training causes people to become conditioned to set aside ethical concerns and to over-react to lesser disasters.&lt;ref name="Annas"/&gt;

'''Zhang Yinwu''' ({{zh|張蔭梧}}); 1891 – May 27, 1949) was a [[Kuomintang]] educator and politician of the Republic of China. He was born in [[Baoding]], [[Hebei]]. He was a graduate of the [[Baoding Military Academy]]. He was the 17th Republican mayor of [[Beijing]]. After the capture of Beijing (called [[Beiping]] at the time) by the forces of the [[Communist Party of China]], he was arrested by the [[People's Liberation Army]] in February 1949 and jailed. He died 3 months later in prison.
