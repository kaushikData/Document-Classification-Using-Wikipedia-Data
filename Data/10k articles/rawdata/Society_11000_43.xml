'''Ayeneh taudani''', or mirror-throwing, is one of the [[Nowruz]] traditions in northern regions of [[Iran]]. In the last days of [[Esfand]], the last month in the [[Jalali calendar]], a host of the youth gather together and contribute in making a double-face square mirror decorated and framed by [[Primulaceae|primrose]]s, [[Violet (plant)|violet]]s, and green sticks of Shamshad. The party waits for the night to come and after dinner time they the mirror to a long piece of rope. Then all of the party goes to the neighborhood and throws the mirror, which is very well-cushioned by flowers and plants, through the intendedly left-ajar door into the middle of the house with a bunch of flowers. A member of the house brings back the mirror to the party and gifts them with comfits, [[halva]] and other food stuff especially prepared for Nowruz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lahig.ir/fa/pages/?cid=1332 |title=جشن نوروز در گیلان |publisher=Lahig.ir |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bangkok Malay''' also referred as '''Bangkok Melayu''' or '''Nayu''' is the local variant of [[Malay language|Malay]] spoken by ethnic [[Malay people|Malays]] living in [[Bangkok]] and its surrounding areas. It arose after the intermingling of Malay community from [[Southern Thailand]] and slowly diverge as a distinct variety of Malay. Despite historical Malay presence in what is now Bangkok dated as early as [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] era, the dialect nonetheless only began to develop after the settlement of deportees from [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Pattani]], [[Satun]] and [[Yaring District|Yaring]] dating from 1786.

The speakers of Bangkok Malay can be found throughout the city, with higher concentration in Malay enclaves in [[Thon Buri District|Thon Buri]], [[Thung Khru District|Thung Khru]], [[Phra Pradaeng District|Phra Pradaeng]], [[Bang Kho Laem District|Bang Kho Laem]], [[Phra Khanong District|Phra Khanong]], [[Khlong Saen Saep]], [[Min Buri District|Min Buri]], [[Nong Chok District|Nong Chok]], [[Bang Nam Priao District|Bang Nam Priao]], [[Chachoengsao Province|Chachoengsao]], [[Thon Buri District|Thon Buri]] and [[Pom Prap Sattru Phai District|Pom Prap Sattru Phai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aksorn.com/lib/detail_print.php?topicid=411 |title=เรื่องความเป็นมาของศาสนาอิสลามในประเทศไทย |publisher=Aksorn |location=Thailand |language=Thai|date=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are several variations of the dialect, owing to various waves and origin of Malay settlement in the city. The dialect was largely based on Pattani Malay with visible divergent from the original spoken in the south, this allowed Bangkok Malay to constitute as a separate dialect from Pattani Malay. Another notable sub-dialect of Bangkok Malay spoken in [[Bang Bua Thong District|Bang Bua Thong]] and [[Pak Kret District|Tha It]] districts demonstrating a strong [[Kedah Malay language|Kedahan]] influence, this correlates to the fact that most Malay people from these areas are the descendant of deportees that were bought from a village in western [[Yala province|Yala]] in the 18th century, who spoke with a Kedahan dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tci-thaijo.org/index.php/JLC/article/view/23596/20081 |title=Bang Bua Thong Dialect - a lexicon study|publisher= |location=Thailand |language=Thai|date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the rise of urbanism and the assimilation with the larger [[Thaification|Thai majority]], the language is now highly confined with adult over the age of 40 with varied fluency among younger generations.

[[File:Cabin boy ou mousse 1799.jpg|thumb|Cabin boy, 1799]]
A '''cabin boy''' or '''ship's boy''' is a [[boy]] (in the sense of low-ranking young male employee, not always a minor in the juridical sense) who waits on the officers and passengers of a [[ship]],&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Oxford Dictionary'', Oxford University Press 1999, entry "Cabin boy"&lt;/ref&gt; especially running errands for the captain.
==Duties==
Cabin boys were usually 13–16 years old, but sometimes as young as 8,&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.es/books?id=cVcAAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA174&amp;lpg=PA174&amp;dq=%22cabin+boys%22+%22as+young+as%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MC1-9kyYDS&amp;sig=iTwIO4e4lfK8JqdQSpY3FdPes_g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwixmbGyxfDcAhUpLsAKHZ2uDFMQ6AEwDXoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cabin%20boys%22%20%22as%20young%20as%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; and also helped the cook in the [[galley (kitchen)|ship's kitchen]] and carried buckets of food from the ship's kitchen to the [[forecastle]] where the ordinary seamen ate. They would have to run from one end of the ship to the other carrying messages and become familiar with the sails, lines and ropes and the use of each in all sorts of weather. They would have to scramble up the rigging into the yards whenever the sails had to be trimmed. They would occasionally stand watch like other crewmen or act as helmsman in good weather, holding the wheel to keep the ship steady on her course.

The '''caste system among Indian Christians''' often reflects stratification by sect, location, and the [[Indian caste system|castes]] of their predecessors.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9360711/Christian-caste Christian Castes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129202451/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9360711/Christian-caste# |date=2006-11-29 }} Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; The caste system today is beyond Hinduism (Hindu society) and it exists in most religions in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/802759/beyond-hinduism-is-caste-a-religious-or-a-regional-problem|title=Beyond Hinduism: Is caste a religious or a regional problem?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caste distinctions among Indian Christians are breaking down at about the same rate as those among Indians belonging to other religions. There exists evidence to show that Christian individuals have mobility within their respective castes.&lt;ref name="fuller"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Kerala Christians and the Caste System |first=C. J. |last=Fuller |journal=Man |series=New series |volume=11 |issue=1 |date=March 1976 |pages=53–70 |jstor=2800388 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, in some cases, social inertia causes old traditions and biases against other castes to remain, causing caste segregation to persist among Indian Christians.&lt;ref name="britannica2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9082413/Christian-caste|title=Christian caste|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kBTkAAAAMAAJ Struggle for justice to Untouchable Christians] Brojendra Nath Banerjee, Uiliyāma Kerī Sṭāḍi eyāṇḍ Risārca Seṇṭāra.

Christian priests, nuns, Dalits and similar groups are also found in [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Ethnographic discourse of the other: conceptual and methodological issues|pages = 39–116|author1=Panchanan Mohanty |author2=Ramesh C. Malik |author3=Eswarappa Kasi |publisher = Cambridge Scholars|year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are sections of Christians in India like in Odisha, West Bengal, etc. who do not belong to any caste having lost caste at conversion. Sometimes, this practise from generations has contributed to an integrated society.

==Kerala==
[[Roman Catholics]] in Kerala consist of [[Latin Catholics]], [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]] &amp; [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kcbcsite.com/kerala1.php&lt;/ref&gt; Syrian Christians in Kerala consist of the members of the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]] and [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]], both ''[[sui iuris]]'' [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] under Roman Catholic church, as well as the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]], [[Malankara Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church]], [[Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church]], [[Chaldean Syrian Church]], and Syrian Christians of the [[Madhya Kerala Diocese]] of the [[Church of South India]], which is a united autonomous Indian church within the [[Anglican Communion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.csimkd.net/History.aspx# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128075052/http://www.csimkd.net/History.aspx# |archive-date=2016-01-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goa==
In the Indian state of [[Goa]], mass conversions were carried out by Portuguese Latin Catholic missionaries from the 16th century onwards. The Hindu converts retained their caste practices due to the involuntary nature of the mass conversions. This led to a lack of conscientious belief in Christian practices which perpetuated the existence of the social stratification. The Portuguese colonists, even during the [[Goan Inquisition]], did not do anything to change the caste system. Thus, the original Hindu [[Brahmins]] in Goa, the only caste that could be ordained, now became Christian ''[[Roman Catholic Brahmin|Bamonns]]'' and the [[Kshatriya]] and [[Vaishya Vani]]s became Christian noblemen called ''[[Roman Catholic Kshatriya|Chardos]]'' .  Those Vaishya Vanis who could not get admitted into the ''Chardo'' caste became ''Gauddos'', and [[Shudra]]s became ''Sudirs''. Finally, the [[Dalit]]s or "Untouchables" who converted to Christianity became ''Maharas'' and ''Chamars'' (an appellation of the anti-Dalit ethnic slur ''Chamaar'').

==Tamil Nadu==
Christians in the state belong to the [[Vellalar]], [[Udayar (caste)|Udaiyar]], [[Paravar]], [[Nadar (caste)|Nadar]], [[Adi Dravida]]r, and other Castes. Mass conversion of [[Paravar]]s date back to the Portuguese era and the conflict over the [[Pearl Fishery Coast]] between the Paravars and Arabs in the 15th century A.D.The Paravars converted 'en masse' to Christianity and became the subjects of the Portuguese King. The [[Nadar (caste)|Nadar]] conversion to Christianity dates back to the British Colonial era in the 18th-century. The first to initiate the conversion was [[Mylaudy]] Village by Sir Ringle Taube. Later in the 19th century, the [[Vellalar]]s, the [[Udayar (caste)|Udaiyars]] and [[Schedule castes]] embraced Christianity.  The cohesion of ''[[Jāti|jati]]s'' among caste [[Christian]]s (e.g. [[Paravas]]) and the strength of caste leadership are noted by scholars to be much stronger than comparable predominantly [[Hindu]] castes in [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref name="kau"&gt;Kauffman, S. B. "A Christian Caste in Hindu Society: Religious Leadership and Social Conflict among the Paravas of Southern Tamilnadu." ''Modern Asian Studies''. 15, No. 2, (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Under the law==
Indian law does not provide benefits for "Untouchable Christians", however Christians have been agitating for the same rights given to [[Hindu]], [[Buddhist]], and [[Sikh]] [[Scheduled castes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/21/by-2050-india-to-have-worlds-largest-populations-of-hindus-and-muslims/|title=By 2050, India to have world’s largest populations of Hindus and Muslims}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the activists point of discrimination due to social tag or status, which doesn't go away, [[K. G. Balakrishnan]] asked:
"Could the Christians admit that they practise caste system and that Dalits (among them) face social discrimination requiring reservation to uplift their cause? This is not all that easy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Do_Christians_also_practise_caste_system_asks_SC/articleshow/2218560.cms |title=Do Christians also practise caste system, asks SC |newspaper=Times of India |date=July 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians also oppose the proposed labeling of "[[Christian]] [[Scheduled caste]]s" because they feel their identity may be assimilated. Pastor Salim Sharif of the [[Church of North India]] notes "We are becoming another class and caste."&lt;ref&gt;Sharif interview 17 November 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caste discrimination among Christians==
===Incidence===

Presently in India, more than [[Socio Economic and Caste Census_2011#Distribution | 42 per cent]] of Indian Christians are [[Dalits]], but the higher caste [[Catholic]]s control 90 per cent of the Catholic churches administrative jobs. According to Dalit Christians website, out of the 156 [[catholic]] bishops, only six are from lower castes. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dalitchristians.com/Html/arulappa.htm Problems and Struggles] Dalitchristians.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Untouchable Catholics have spoken out against discrimination against them by members of the Catholic Church. A  Dalit activist with a ''nom-de-plume'' of Bama Faustina has written books that are critical of the discrimination by the nuns and priests in Churches in South India (CSI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/09/16/stories/1316017m.htm A palmyra leaf that sears us] [[The Hindu]] – September 16, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; During 2003 [[ad limina]] visits of the bishops of India, [[Pope John Paul II]] criticized the caste discrimination in the [[Catholic Church in India]] when addressing bishops of the ecclesiastical provinces of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Madras and Mylapore|Madras-Mylapore]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Madurai|Madurai]] and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Pondicherry and Cuddalore|Pondicherry-Cuddalore]], the three archbishops of Tamil Nadu. He went on to say: "It is the Church's obligation to work unceasingly to change hearts, helping all people to see every human being as a child of God, a brother or sister of Christ, and therefore a member of our own family".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Address to the Bishops of India on their ad Limina visit|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/2003/november/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20031117_ad-limina-india_en.html|accessdate=17 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/article-8716?l=english Papal Address to Bishops of Madras-Mylapore, Madurai and Pondicherry-Cuddalore] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922115639/http://zenit.org/article-8716?l=english# |date=2008-09-22 }} ZENIT – November 17, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dalit Christians=== 
Mass conversions of lower caste Hindus took place in order to escape the discrimination. The main Dalit groups that participated in these conversions were Chuhras of Punjab, Chamars of North India (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh), Vankars of Gujarat and Pulayas of Kerala.&lt;ref name="Dalit Christians In India"&gt;[http://www.dalitstudies.org.in/uploads/publication/1473146694.pdf Dalit Christians In India] Sobin George 2012&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that “Christianity is a true religion; a desire for protection from oppressors and, if possible, material aid; the desire for education for their children; and the knowledge that those who have become Christians had improved”.&lt;ref&gt;South Indian Missionary Congress. 1908. ‘The Report of Conference Held at Madras’&lt;/ref&gt; Christianity was thought to be egalitarian and could provide mobility away from the caste.
Even after conversion, Dalits were discriminated against due to the “residual leftover” practice of caste discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[‘Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and its Implications’, Complete Revised Edition, Chicago: Chicago University Press] Dumont, Louis. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; This is attributed to the predominant Hindu society they lived in.The environment and power structures of the society they engaged in was the same. Sometimes the only change seen was their personal religious identity. In many cases they were still referred to by their Hindu caste names. Example Pulayans in Kerala, Pariah in Tamil Nadu and Madigas in Andra Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;[‘Caste-based Discrimination and Atrocities on Dalit Christians and the Need for Reservations’, Working Paper Series, II(04): New Delhi: Indian Institute of Dalit Studies.] Louis, Prakash. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first people converted by Jesuits of the Madura Mission to Christianity were members of Nadars, Maravars and Pallars (untouchables).&lt;ref&gt;[The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute Vol. 2, No. 3 (Sep., 1996)] David Mosse.&lt;/ref&gt; Caste based occupations held by Dalits also show a clear segregation which perpetuated even after becoming Christian. Occupational patterns (including manual scavenging) are prevalent among Dalit Christians in north-west India are quite similar to that of Dalit Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;[ ‘Rural Christian Community in North West India’, New Delhi] Dogar, Vidya Sagar. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational discrimination for Dalit Christians goes so far as to restrict not only employment but also clean sanitation and water.&lt;ref&gt;Jose, Kananaikil. 1990. [‘Scheduled Castes Converts and Social Disabilities: A Survey of Tamil Nadu’]&lt;/ref&gt; Inter caste marriage among Christians is also not commonly practiced. For example, Syrian Christians in Kerala do not marry Dalit Christians. Even intermarriage between Bamons and Sudras in Goa is quite uncommon. Sometimes marriage to a higher class Hindu is preferred to marriage to a Dalit Christian. Discrimination against Dalit Christians also remained in interactions and mannerisms between castes for example ‘lower caste christians’ had to close their mouth when talking to a Syrian Christian.&lt;ref name="Dalit Christians In India"/&gt; Even after conversion segregation, restriction, hierarchy and graded ritual purity remained. Data shows that there is more discrimination and less class mobility in rural areas.&lt;ref name="Dalit Christians In India"/&gt;

In many cases, the churches themselves perpetuated the caste system. Some churches referred to the Dalits as ‘New Christians'. It is a derogatory term that classifies the Dalit Christians in order to allow other Christians to look down upon them. In many churches in south India Dalits had either separate seating or had to attend the mass from outside.&lt;ref&gt;Louis, Prakash. 2007.[ ‘Caste-based Discrimination and Atrocities on Dalit Christians and the Need for Reservations’, Working Paper Series, II(04): New Delhi: Indian Institute of Dalit Studies.]&lt;/ref&gt; Dalit Christians are also grossly underrepresented amongst the clergy.&lt;ref&gt;[Indian Dalits find no refuge from caste in Christianity] BBC, sept 14 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  There are a few churches that accept the reality of castes in Christianity and discrimination towards dalits. Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India and the National Council of Churches in India have backed changes in the church and law to benefit Dalit Christians.

Headquartered in Beijing, China, CAA was established officially March 3, 2001.

[[Image:CAA international logo for distribution.jpg|frame|right|CAA logo]]

To enter the international arena, CAA established a partnership with ACFA in 2002. CAA abides by ACFA standards, and invites ACFA judges to preside over its official competitive events.

==Purpose==
CAA's official goal is to publicize and promote [[pedigreed]] breeds of cats and to propagate the well-being of all non-pedigree cats, domestic, stray, feral or wild. CAA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine

The CAA logo design depicts a stylized Dragon Li.

==Activities==
CAA is evolving as an organization, with various programs such as [[Animal rescue group|cat rescue]], and a [[trap–neuter–return]] (TNR) effort for thousands of documented feral and abandoned felines throughout Asia. CAA also trains and assists catteries, and purebred feline owners in [[Breed registry|registering]] pedigrees.

Like most such organizations, it also organizes competitive [[cat show]]s. CAA's third show (January 1–3, 2004, in Beijing) was briefly documented, in English, by a visiting Canadian ACFA member in 2004 on a website, including photographs of two CAA breeds, the Chinese White and the Dragon Li; ACFA's Dolores Kennedy and Barb Belanger were guest all-breed judges at the event.&lt;ref name="Belanger"&gt;{{cite web |first=Barb J. |last=Belanger |title=Cat Aficionado Association: The Show – January 1, 2 and 3 |date=2005 |via=Members.Shaw.ca |publisher=self-published |url=http://members.shaw.ca:80/bjbelanger/China.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430032756/http://members.shaw.ca/bjbelanger/China.htm# |archive-date=2007-04-30 |access-date=31 July 2018 |df= }} Zero of the numerous Internet Archive captures of this site saved all of the photos on it, but they can all be recovered by looking at different saves on different dates.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles David (Chic) Anderson''' (December 17, 1931 – March 24, 1979) was an American [[sportscaster]] and [[public address]] [[announcer]] specializing in Thoroughbred [[horse racing]]. He was one of American sports' most famous PA voices, and remains among its most revered [[race caller]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/25/archives/charles-chic-anderson-dies-well-known-race-caller-was-47.html ''New York Times'' archives, March 25, 1979  obituary Charles (Chic) Anderson]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racing background==
A native of [[Evansville, Indiana]], Anderson got his start in horse racing in 1951, working part-time in the mutuel department at Dade Park (now [[Ellis Park Racecourse]]) in nearby [[Henderson, Kentucky]]. Eight years later, in 1959, Anderson became track announcer.

The following year, in 1960, Anderson also became the public-address voice of [[Churchill Downs]], home of the [[Kentucky Derby]]. He would call 16 Runs for the Roses between then and 1977. During that stretch, Anderson also worked as a Midwest sports anchor, gaining the TV experience that would serve him well nationally in the 1970s.

In addition to Ellis and Churchill, Anderson worked at [[Oaklawn Park]], [[Santa Anita Park]], [[Ak-Sar-Ben (arena)|Ak-Sar-Ben]] and [[Arlington Park]] racetracks in the 1960s and 1970s.

Starting in 1969, Anderson's Derby calls would not only be heard by Churchill patrons but also on the [[CBS]] Television Network, where he assumed [[Jack Drees]]' role on the network's coverage of all three [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]] races, as well as other thoroughbred events. Anderson would eventually gain a level of fame as a national race caller exceeded only by that of [[Clem McCarthy]] and [[Ted Husing]].

Because of his TV experience and knowledge of horses, CBS adopted him as a full-fledged member of their sportscasting team for big races, providing jockey interviews and insights as well as the race calls.

Anderson would remain at Churchill Downs until May 1977. After calling [[Seattle Slew]]'s victory in the Derby for both Churchill and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Television, he moved his base of operations to the [[New York Racing Association]] tracks (including [[Belmont Park]]), succeeding NYRA race caller [[Dave Johnson (announcer)|Dave Johnson]]. That allowed him to call Slew's victory in the 1977 [[Belmont Stakes]] for the racetrack, which likely makes Anderson the only man to call two Triple Crown races on the tracks' public-address systems in one year.

During his NYRA tenure, Anderson's daily calls would not only be heard by fans at the track, but also on [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS Radio]].

In fall 1978, Anderson called Slew's last race, the [[Stuyvesant Handicap]] at [[Aqueduct Racetrack]], live for CBS Television, WCBS radio and, the Big A fans. As Slew, ridden by [[Angel Cordero, Jr.]], roared down the stretch far enough in front to ensure a win, Anderson emoted. "Ladies and gentlemen, here he is, the champion of the world, Seattle Slew!"

=="A tremendous machine!"==
For CBS Television, Anderson authored the two most famous calls in horse-racing history—and two of the most famous sportscasts in TV history—the Triple Crown clinchings in the [[Belmont Stakes]] of 1973 and 1978.

He was behind the CBS mic on June 9, 1973, when Derby and [[Preakness Stakes]] winner [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]] tried to become the first horse in a quarter century to win the Crown. A stunned Anderson punctuated Big Red's powerful move on the final turn of the '73 Belmont this way, focusing on Secretariat while still keeping tabs on the other horses' positions:{{quote|They're on the turn, and Secretariat is blazing along! The first three-quarters of a mile in 1:09 and four fifths. Secretariat is widening now! He is moving like a tremendous machine! Secretariat by twelve, Secretariat by fourteen lengths on the turn! Sham is dropping back. It looks like they'll catch him today, as My Gallant and Twice a Prince are both coming up to him now. But Secretariat is all alone! He's out there almost a sixteenth of a mile away from the rest of the horses! Secretariat is in a position that seems impossible to catch. He's into the stretch. Secretariat leads this field by 18 lengths, and now Twice a Prince has taken second and My Gallant has moved back to third. They're in the stretch. Secretariat has opened a 22 length lead! He is going to be the Triple Crown winner! Here comes Secretariat to the wire. An unbelievable, an amazing performance! He hits the finish 25 lengths in front! It's going to be Twice a Prince second, My Gallant third, Private Smiles fourth, and [[Sham (horse)|Sham]], who had it today, dropped back to fifth.}}

A few minutes later, reviewing the videotape of Secretariat's stretch romp, Anderson humbly admitted it was hard to count lengths as Secretariat raced toward home. "I said twenty-five," Anderson said. "It could conceivably have been more."

In fact, the champion's winning margin was fully 31 lengths—a distance it took careful examination of videotape and trackside photographs to measure. Secretariat was so far ahead when he crossed the finish line that the TV camera operator had to pan to the left to pick up the rest of the field, in lieu of leaving an "empty" track in the viewer's line of sight for a few seconds.

=="We'll test these two to the wire!"==
Five years later, for both CBS Sports and the Belmont Park fans, Anderson called a Belmont Stakes race that was as close as the 1973 Belmont was a romp.

[[Affirmed]] and [[Alydar]]&amp;mdash;who battled each other closely both as 2-year-old horses and in the 1978 Triple Crown races (with Affirmed prevailing barely in both the Derby and Preakness)&amp;mdash;renewed their battle in that year's Belmont. They hooked up in earnest a half-mile into the race and held a virtual match race for the rest of the event.{{quote|It is still Affirmed as they come to the quarter pole. He's holding on to a head lead. Alydar is outside of him and challenging that lead. The two are heads apart and Alydar's got a lead! Alydar put a head in front right in the middle of the stretch! It's Alydar and Affirmed battling back along the inside! We'll test these two to the wire! Affirmed under a left-hand whip! Alydar on the outside driving! Affirmed and Alydar heads apart. Affirmed's got a nose in front as they come on the wire!}}

Then, shutting off the PA microphone (as track announcers did then) but keeping his CBS mic hot, he described the final moment of victory:{{quote|At the finish, it's going to be dead tight&amp;mdash;Affirmed won it! He wins the Triple Crown. Alydar is second! Steve Cauthen salutes the crowd. Darby Creek Road in third, Judge Advocate fourth, and Noon Time Spender finished fifth&amp;mdash;and what a stirring stretch battle! They both had their shot at this one during the stretch run!}}

==Voice of racing==
Anderson's style as a public-address announcer—even when the PA call was also carried on TV—was low-key, almost robotic, at the start of a race. (On arena PA systems, rapid-fire calls often end up a blur to the ears of fans scattered throughout a track or stadium). Then Anderson would pick up a vibrant pace halfway through the race.

Anderson used a more animated style at the start when his call aired only on TV, maintaining a brisk pace while remaining measured, avoiding the cliches and the screaming style other track announcers adopted in the 1980s and beyond.

==Prince Thou Ain't==
Anderson's only prominent mistake came in the 1975 Derby, which he called for both the Churchill fans and ABC Television.

Confused by the similar silks of Foolish Pleasure and Prince Thou Art, he described Prince Thou Art as the leader during the late stages of the race, before correcting himself near the end. A newspaper headline on Anderson's rare error read "Prince Thou Ain't".

History-minded observers compared it to a similar mistake that announcer Clem McCarthy had made during the running of the 1947 [[Preakness Stakes]].

==Death==
Anderson died of a [[heart attack]] on March 24, 1979, at his home in [[Commack, New York]], on [[Long Island]]. He was succeeded at both NYRA and CBS by his backup, [[Marshall Cassidy]].

[[File:CriancaLixao20080220MarcelloCasalJrAgenciaBrasil.jpg|thumb]][[Child labor]] is one of [[Brazil]]'s biggest social issues. According to data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) in 2015, more than 2.7 million young people between 5 and 17 years of age work in the country, 79,000 of these children between 5 and 9 years of age.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/app/noticia/economia/2017/06/11/internas_economia,601710/trabalho-infantil-atinge-2-7-milhoes-no-brasil.shtml|title=Trabalho infantil atinge 2,7 milhões de crianças e adolescentes no Brasil|last=Braziliense|first=Correio|date=2017-06-11|work=Correio Braziliense|access-date=2018-10-08|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazilian law establishes 16 as the minimum age for entering the labor market and 14 to work as an apprentice.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/direitos-humanos/noticia/2017-06/brasil-registra-aumento-de-casos-de-trabalho-infantil-entre|title=Brasil registra aumento de trabalho infantil entre crianças de 5 a 9 anos|date=2017-06-12|work=Agência Brasil|access-date=2018-10-08|language=pt-br}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 30% of child labor is in the agricultural sector; in terms of regions, 60% are in the North and Northeast regions. In terms of ethnicity, 65% are black children. In terms of gender, 70% of child laborers are male.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), poverty is one of the main causes of child labor in the world, as is the case in Brazil. Children are forced to work in order to increase family income, putting aside studies and social life.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/noticias/2003/030424_tconvecao.shtml|title=Convenções da OIT intesificam combate ao trabalho infantil {{!}} BBC Brasil {{!}} BBC World Service|website=bbc.com|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/noticias/2003/030428_tperguntas.shtml|title=Tire suas dúvidas sobre trabalho infantil no Brasil {{!}} BBC Brasil {{!}} BBC World Service|website=bbc.com|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the enactment of the 1988 Constitution which prohibits child labor,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the Brazilian government has taken steps to reduce the prevalence of child labor, using international conventions as guidelines. Social movements such as the hashtag ''#ChegaDeTrabalhoInfantil'' were created to raise awareness of child labor in Brazil. Other steps included changes to labor laws, and added funding to welfare programs for families such as ''[[Bolsa Família]]'', a program by the Brazilian government to support poorer families in Brazil.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The number of young people working decreased from about 8 million in 1992 to 5 million in 2003.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Despite recent improvements, Brazil still accounts for a quarter of children working in Latin America. Between 2014 and 2015, there was a 13% increase in the number of working children under 10.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2016, 1,238 reports of cases of child exploitation were registered in the Public Prosecutor's Office.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many cases of child labor in the informal economies went unrecorded, such as child prostitution or drug trafficking.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/811259893|title=Child labour's global past, 1650-2000|date=2011|publisher=Peter Lang|others=Lieten, Kristoffel., Nederveen Meerkerk, Elise van.|isbn=9783035102185|location=Bern|oclc=811259893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
In [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazil's constitution]], child labor is addressed under article 7, item 33. The item prohibits night work, as well as any work deemed "dangerous or unhealthy" for teenagers under 18 years. Minors under 16 are not allowed under the constitution to work at all, except for apprenticeships for minors 14 and up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.direitonet.com.br/artigos/exibir/1610/O-trabalho-infantil-no-Brasil|title=O trabalho infantil no Brasil|work=DireitoNet|access-date=2018-10-09|language=pt-br}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite constitution |article=7 |clause=33 |polity=Brazil |date=1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on the international stage, definitions of child labor vary between organizations.

The term 'child labour', according to [[International Labour Organization|ILO]],&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ilo.org/ipec/facts/lang--en/index.htm|title=What is child labour (IPEC)|website=ilo.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; is defined as "work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development". It refers to work that can cause damage to children mentally, physically, socially or morally, work that deprives children's ability to attend school, work that place heavy burdens on them alongside schoolwork. There is no universal definition of child labor according to ILO since the definition largely depends on the context of the working environment, the legal working age and the type of work engaged. Among all the forms of child labor, ILO defines child slavery, child prostitution, child crime-work (drug trafficking) and any work that jeopardizes the safety of children as the worst forms of child labor.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[UNICEF]] has different criteria for child labor. For children between 5 to 11 years old, actions are categorized as child labor if at least one hour of economic activity or at least 28 hours of domestic work was performed by them weekly. For children between 12 and 14 years of age, at least 14 hours of economic activity or at least 42 hours of economic activity and domestic work per week make them victims of child labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/stats_popup9.html|title=UNICEF - Definitions|website=unicef.org|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Child labor issue has been a part of Brazilian history since 1500. However, because the notion of youth or child was not well defined until the middle of the nineteenth century in Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gutiérrez|first=Horácio|last2=Lewkowicz|first2=Ida|date=1999|title=Trabalho infantil em Minas Gerais na primeira metade do século XIX|url=https://locus.ufjf.emnuvens.com.br/locus/article/view/2342|journal=Locus - Revista de História|language=pt|volume=5|issue=2|issn=1413-3024}}&lt;/ref&gt; there was limited information on child labor before the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Early documentations of Portuguese vessels indicated evidence of minors working in the 16th century for sea voyages as labor for immigrants from Portugal and other parts of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Pestana Ramos|first=Fábio|title=A História Trágico-Marítima das crianças nas embarcações portuguesas do século XVI.|date=1999-01-01|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275601988_A_Historia_Tragico-Maritima_das_criancas_nas_embarcacoes_portuguesas_do_seculo_XVI|pages=19–54|isbn=8572441123|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though children engaged in domestic work prior to the arrival of European settlers, the degree of child labor in Brazil worsened drastically after.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/930464628|title=Boas práticas : combate ao trabalho infantil no mundo|date=2015|publisher=DF|others=International Labour Office., Brazil.

Children in [[favela]]s are seen as valuable and desirable middlemen in drug trafficking since their minor status make them immune to legal prosecution according to the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veloso|first=Leticia|date=2012-10-01|title=Child Street Labor in Brazil: Licit and Illicit Economies in the Eyes of Marginalized Youth|url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/south-atlantic-quarterly/article-abstract/111/4/663/3597/Child-Street-Labor-in-Brazil-Licit-and-Illicit|journal=South Atlantic Quarterly|language=en|volume=111|issue=4|pages=663–679|doi=10.1215/00382876-1724129|issn=0038-2876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not surprisingly, children were used widely as labor force during the [[Slavery in Brazil|slavery period]], working on plantations for sugar productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48214253|title=Combatendo o trabalho infantil : guia para educadores.|date=2001|publisher=CENPEC-Centro de Estudos e Pesquisas em Educação, Cultura e Ação Comunitária, Programa Internacional para a Eliminação do Trabalho Infantil, IPEC, Organização Internacional do Trabalho, Escritório no Brasil|others=International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour., Centro de Estudos e Pesquisas em Educação, Cultura e Ação Comunitária.|isbn=9228110406|edition=1st|location=São Paulo, SP, Brasil|oclc=48214253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slaveholders embraced the idea of making children of slaves work since the overall productivity increases without purchasing more slaves.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Child Labour's Global Past, 1650-2000". eds.b.ebscohost.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrialization in Brazil, starting from the late 19th century, carried on the exploitation of children post-slavery. Capitalists were willing to take in minors since there was no regulation against child labor and children are of low cost. In São Paulo, the center of industrialization where large workforces were demanded, there were advertisements published by textile sectors to recruit children in the mid-1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mulheres e menores no trabalho industrial: os fatores sexo e idade na dinâmica do capita|last=Moura|first=Esmeralda|publisher=|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the working class of São Paulo was composed of poor immigrants, and the work of immigrant children was a valuable source of income that some families depended on.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In 1890, 25 percent of São Paulo's textile industry labor force was  made up of children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Rio de Janeiro, 64 percent of workers in a textile factory were children in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/27266945|title=História da indústria e do trabalho no Brasil : das origens aos anos 20|last=1952-|first=Foot, Francisco,|date=1991|publisher=Editora Atica|others=Leonardi, Victor, 1942-|isbn=8508037562|edition= 2nd|location=São Paulo|oclc=27266945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children suffered physical injuries or death due to the harsh work engaged in, the poor working conditions, and the violent treatment from their business owners. Armando Dias, a minor worker in the textile industry, was killed by an electric shock during work in November 1913.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; When teenager Francisco Augusto de Fonseca didn't perform his job up to the owner's expectation, his face was brutally hit by the owner.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Child labor during this period was seen as a necessity: capitalists exploited the low cost of minor workers and used them to suppress the wages for adult workers; poor families also needed children to work to support their life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Attempts to protect the rights of children and regulate child labor emerged during the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There was a decree in 1891 that concerned minor employees in the factories of the Federal Capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campos|first=Herculano Ricardo|date=2001|title=TRABALHO INFANTIL PRODUTIVO E DESENVOLVIMENTO HUMANO|url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/pe/v8n1/v8n1a15|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, the Brazilian Labour Confederation was established, pushing for restrictions on child labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Anarquistas_e_comunistas_no_Brasil.html?id=bKNAAAAAYAAJ|title=Anarquistas e comunistas no Brasil: 1900-1935|last=Dulles|first=John W. F.|date=1977|publisher=Nova Frontera|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, workers in São Paulo went on strike, their demands including eradication of night work for workers under the age of 18 and total eradication of work for those under 14. In 1919, a law passed in São Paulo restricted legal working age to 14 years old. The constitutional amendments (1934,1937,1946) rendered any work performed by minors under 14 illegal. But during the military government ruling period, minimum working age was lowered to 12. The 1988 amendment, the 1998 amendment and a law in 2000 together made up of the current legal definition of child labor: prohibiting any form of hazardous work for minors under 18 and prohibiting any form of labor for minors under 16. The exception to this law is apprenticeships, which are allowed at 14.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On February 2, 2000, the government ratified [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention|ILO convention 182]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:11300:0::NO:11300:P11300_INSTRUMENT_ID:312327|title=Ratifications of ILO conventions: Ratifications by Convention|website=ilo.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 28 of the same year, the Brazilian government ratified [[Minimum Age Convention, 1973|ILO convention 138]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:11300:0::NO:11300:P11300_INSTRUMENT_ID:312283|title=Ratifications of ILO conventions: Ratifications by Convention|website=ilo.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Child_Employment_Rate.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Child_Employment_Rate.jpg|thumb]]
Nowadays, through achievements made by the country it is clear that the Brazilian governments demonstrate considerable commitment and dedication to eradicate child labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.todamateria.com.br/trabalho-infantil-no-brasil/|title=Trabalho Infantil no Brasil|work=Toda Matéria|access-date=2018-10-10|language=pt-br}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] conducts the Brazilian National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) annually, first administered in 1981. This survey boosts the availability of data on child labor reports in the region. In 2005, more than 2.9 million children under the age of 17 engaged in some form of labor. This figure represents 7.8% of the age group back in 2005.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The survey in 2016 indicates that 4.6% of the 5-17 age group (1.8 million out of 30 million) are working, which is a large improvement from 2005. In 2016, most of the minor employments are found in the age group 14-17. 0.2% of the 5-9 age group is working, 1.3% for the 10-13 age group, 6.4% for the 14-16 age group and 17% for the 16-17 age group. The extent to which child labor persists varies between regions. The North and the South have the highest child working rate at 5.7% and 6.3% respectively. For the age group under 14, the North and the Northeast have the highest rate at 1.5% and 1%. In terms of race, the black and brown (Preta e parda) population covers 64.1% of child labor as compared to the 35.9% of the white (Branca). In terms of gender, 65.3% are male children. 47.6% of children of 5–13 years are engaged in agricultural activities, while 21.4% of 14–17 years do so. In some cases agricultural duties are performed because they are seen as a part of the socialization process, but this does not negate the fact some children are forced to work in agriculture to compensate family incomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://loja.ibge.gov.br/pnad-continua-trabalho-infantil-2016.html|title=PNAD Contínua - Trabalho Infantil|website=loja.ibge.gov.br|language=pt|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that the percentage of child labor is gradually decreasing, many children in Brazil are still engaged in child labor, including in hazardous fields. Within the agricultural sector, children fish and harvest mollusks, produce rice, soy, tobacco, and are involved in charcoal production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=O Trabalho Infantil no Brasil|last=|first=|publisher=ABRINQ Foundation|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the industrial sector, children work in quarries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://redeglobo.globo.com/pi/redeclube/noticia/2013/08/globo-reporter-mostra-imagens-de-trabalho-infantil-no-estado-do-piaui.html|title=Globo Repórter mostra imagens de trabalho infantil no estado do Piauí|work=redeglobo.globo.com|access-date=2018-10-10|language=pt-br}}&lt;/ref&gt; produce bricks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://agenciaal.alesc.sc.gov.br/index.php/radioal/noticia_single_radioal/naeo-e-brincadeira-o-trabalho-infantil-que-santa-catarina-naeo-ve|title=Não é brincadeira: O trabalho infantil que Santa Catarina não vê|website=agenciaal.alesc.sc.gov.br|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and slaughter animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.brazzil.com/23990-despite-strict-laws-child-labor-in-brazil-is-not-going-away|title=Despite Strict Laws, Child Labor in Brazil Is Not Going Away|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the service sector, children are found doing street work such as garbage scavenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CRC/C/BRA/CO/2-4&amp;Lang=en|title=Treaty bodies Download|website=tbinternet.ohchr.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Child laborers doing street work also sometimes sell alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opovo.com.br/app/maisnoticias/brasil/2016/06/12/noticiasbrasil,3623300/trabalho-infantil-no-nordeste-perpetua-o-ciclo-da-pobreza-e-miseria.shtml|title=Trabalho infantil no Nordeste perpetua o ciclo da pobreza e miséria|website=opovo.com.br|language=pt-br|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children are also made to work for criminal groups&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://epoca.globo.com/brasil/noticia/2017/01/traficantes-cariocas-recrutam-e-armam-criancas-cada-vez-mais-novas-para-o-crime.html|title=Traficantes cariocas recrutam e armam crianças cada vez mais novas para o crime|work=epoca.globo.com|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; or engage in prostitution.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.childrenwin.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/140509_Sexual-exploitation-of-children-in-Brazil_putting-a-spot-on-the-p....pdf|title=Sexual Exploitation of Children in Brazil: Putting a Spot on the Problem|last=des Hommes|first=Terre|date=May 9, 2014|work=|access-date=Oct 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Child sex tourism is common in coastal areas that usually attract tourists and girls from other South American countries are involved in commercial sex in Brazil.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The [[Ministry of Labour and Employment (Brazil)|Ministry of Labor]] (MTE) is the major government institution in charge of labor law enforcement. The responsibilities of this institution include conducting child labor inspections, enforcing child labor laws, and dispatching inspection teams (inspectors, labor prosecutors, Federal Police officers, and other law enforcement officials) to sites where potential child labor activity is suspected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trabalho.gov.br/trab_estrang_ing/default.asp|title=Página inicial|website=trabalho.gov.br|language=pt-br|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, existing gaps in the operations of MTE hinder the full enforcement of labor laws. 7,491 child labor inspections were conducted in the year 2017, but insufficient funding limits the abilities of regions where there are no local MTE offices to conduct inspections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trabalho Infantil nos ODS|last=|first=|publisher=Fórum Nacional de Prevenção e Erradicação do Trabalho Infantil (FNPETI)|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, inspectors were prevented from performing child labor inspections in the states of São Paulo and Rio Grande do Norte.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/ministerio-do-trabalho-nega-pedidos-de-fiscalizacao-por-falta-de-recurso-diz-mpt-21634439|title=Ministério do Trabalho nega pedidos de fiscalização por falta de recurso, diz MPT|date=2017-07-26|work=O Globo|access-date=2018-10-11|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trabalho infantil em Goianésia do Pará.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Children awaiting permission to sell their products on a long-distance bus in northern Brazil in 2012.]]

=== National Plan to Combat Sexual Violence Against Children and Adolescents (2013–2020)&lt;ref&gt;Plano Nacional de Enfrentamento da Violência Sexual contra Crianças e Adolescentes. (2013)http://www.crianca.mppr.mp.br/arquivos/File/publi/sedh/08_2013_pnevsca.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;===
This plan reaffirms uncompromising commitment to defend the rights of children and adolescents, especially those who are in threatening situations where fundamental rights are violated. Specifically, this plan "identifies strategies to prevent the sexual exploitation of children, protect children’s rights, and assist child victims".&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The goals of the plan include:

# Ensure preventive action against abuse or sexual exploitation of children and adolescents, primarily through education, awareness and self-defense.
# Ensure specialized assistance to children and adolescents in situations of sexual abuse or exploitation, by trained and specialized professionals, as well as ensuring care for the person who commits sexual violence, while respecting the diversity of ethnic-racial condition, gender, religion, culture, sexual orientation, etc.
# Update the regulatory framework on sexual crimes, combat impunity, provide skilled reporting and accountability services.
# Promote the active participation of children and adolescents for the defense of their rights in the development and implementation of protection policies.
# Strengthen national joint, regional and local coping and the elimination of abuse or sexual exploitation involving media, networking, forums, commissions, councils.
# Understanding the expressions of abuse or sexual exploitation of children and adolescents through diagnostics, data collection, studies and research.

=== National Plan for the Eradication of Forced Labor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://reporterbrasil.org.br/documentos/novoplanonacional.pdf|title=2º Plano Nacional para a Erradicação do Trabalho Escravo|last=|first=|date=2008|website=Conselho Nacional de Justiça|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;===
Forced labor is an integral part of the child labor issue in Brazil. Some children are forced to do domestic work or play in the soccer clubs; some children are forced to produce coffee and manioc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CRC/C/BRA/CO/2-4&amp;Lang=en|title=Treaty bodies Download|website=tbinternet.ohchr.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current version of the National Plan for the Eradication, introduced in 2008, establishes the policy framework in combating forced labor. Top goals of this plan include:

# Keep the eradication of forced labor as a priority for the state.
# Establish integrated operational strategies of action in relation to the preventive actions of the executive bodies, prosecutors and civil society in order to eradicate forced labor.
# Create and maintain a database containing information of key players involved in the fight against forced labor to assist in prevention and repression actions and drafting of laws.
# Provide national and regional mobile inspection teams in sufficient numbers to meet the complaints and demands of the annual plan of inspection.

Education is believed to be the best solution to child labor issues to a certain extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unric.org/pt/actualidade/17859|title=Educação é fundamental para combater trabalho infantil|website=unric.org|language=pt-pt|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Education Plan is a demonstration of the determination of the Brazilian government to improve the quality and accessibility of education. This plan entails 20 goals encompassing basic education for children and also aims to promote the quality of higher education. For example, goal #14 of the plan states the objective to gradually increase the number of enrollments in graduate school.

== Social programs ==
There are many social programs in Brazil that aim to address child labor directly or indirectly. Some are funded by government, such as [[Bolsa Família]], a family welfare program introduced during [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula's]] presidency. Some take the form of social media, gathering internet attention such as ''#ChegaDeTrabalhoInfantil (#stopchildlabor)''.

=== National Program to Eradicate Child Labor&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;http://www.chegadetrabalhoinfantil.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/comissao-municipal-do-peti.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;===
This program is a set of actions that aim to remove children and adolescents under 16 from early work, excluding apprenticeships from 14 years of age. Besides ensuring a direct transfer of income to families, the program offers the inclusion of children and young people in counseling and follow-up services. Attendance at school is a requirement. It is initiated and administered by the Ministry of Social Development.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The Federal Government pays a monthly grant: of R $25 per child in activity for the family who withdraws the child labor, in municipalities, in rural or urban areas, with a population of less than 250,000 inhabitants; of R $40 per child, in urban activity, in capitals, metropolitan regions and municipalities with a population 250,000 inhabitants. The benefited family has to ensure a higher than 85% attendance of their kids above clearing them from child labor to receive the grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caixa.gov.br/programas-sociais/peti/Paginas/default.aspx|title=PETI - Programas Sociais {{!}} Caixa|website=caixa.gov.br|language=pt-br|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Bolsa Família]]===
Bolsa Família is a social welfare program of the Government of Brazil, part of the Fome Zero network of federal assistance programs. Bolsa Família provides financial aid to poor Brazilian families; and if they have children, families must ensure that the children attend school and are vaccinated. If they exceed the total of permitted school absences, they are dropped from the program and their funds are suspended. In 2017, 93.1 percent of 6–15 years old achieve 85 percent school attendance; 82.3 percent of 16–17 years old met the minimum requirement of 75% school attendance.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; However, studies suggest that the program, while it has improved girls' school participation and educational performance, has had little impact on boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Brauw|first=Alan|last2=Gilligan|first2=Daniel O.|last3=Hoddinott|first3=John|last4=Roy|first4=Shalini|date=2015-06|title=The Impact of Bolsa Família on Schooling|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.02.001|journal=World Development|volume=70|pages=303–316|doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.02.001|issn=0305-750X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== #StopChildLabor Campaign ===
In 2017, the Public Ministry of Labor (MPT) began a campaign under the [[hashtag]] "#StopChildLabor" that seeks the engagement of Internet users in social networks, encouraging them to post the hashtag in support of the cause against child labor. The campaign received support from celebrities, including musicians [[Daniel (Brazilian singer)|Daniel]], [[Chitãozinho and Xororó]], former volleyball player [[Maurício Lima]] and former basketball player [[Hortência Marcari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.justificando.com/2017/06/09/mpt-lanca-campanha-contra-exploracao-do-trabalho-infantil/|title=MPT lança campanha contra à exploração do trabalho infantil|date=2017-06-09|work=Justificando|access-date=2018-10-13|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[Mobutu Sese Seko]] ruled [[Zaire]] from 1965 to 1997, looting his country's wealth for personal use to such a degree that critics coined the term "[[kleptocracy]]". A relative once explained how the government illicitly collected revenue: "Mobutu would ask one of us to go to the bank and take out a million. We'd go to an intermediary and tell him to get five million. He would go to the bank with Mobutu's authority, and take out ten. Mobutu got one, and we took the other nine."&lt;ref name=a&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Mobutu institutionalized corruption to prevent political rivals from challenging his control, leading to an [[Economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo#1990s|economic collapse in 1996]].&lt;ref name=b&gt;

'''Eastmont Town Center''' is a [[shopping mall]] and social services hub{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} located on {{convert|33|acre|m2}} bounded by Foothill Boulevard, Bancroft and 73rd Avenues, and Church Street, in the [[East Oakland, Oakland, California|Frick]] neighborhood of [[East Oakland, Oakland, California|East]] [[Oakland, California|Oakland]].&lt;ref name="Nextdoor" /&gt; The mall opened in 1970 on the site of a 1920s-era [[Chevrolet]] automobile factory called [[Oakland Assembly]]. Architect [[William Pereira]] designed the building. It is physically almost next to, and by entry access a few blocks away from the similarly sized [[Evergreen Cemetery (Oakland, California)|Evergreen Cemetery]].

==History==
[[File:Eastmont Town Center in 2014.jpg|thumb|left|A "[[Dead mall|dead]]" corridor inside the mall in 2014]]
Originally known as '''Eastmont Mall''', the mall was a popular and heavily used shopping destination during most of the 1970s and 1980s, but declined by the 1990s due to a huge drop in the average income level, and a concurrent increase in the crime rate in the mall and the surrounding neighborhoods. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/real-estate/2015/04/eastmont-town-center-oakland-mall-sold-54-million.html?ana=e_bay_real&amp;s=newsletter&amp;ed=2015-04-03&amp;u=pdRFGG9GFoAnBtzk6JdWAw07f5cd6f&amp;t=1428085231&amp;page=all "Failed" Bay Area mall sold for $54.5 million], From the San Francisco Business Times website, accessed Jan 30, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastmont's primary anchor tenants were [[J.C. Penney|JCPenney]], [[Mervyns]], [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth's]] (including a [[lunch counter]]), [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]], [[Pay 'n Save]] and [[G.R. Kinney Company|Kinney Shoes]], one of the nation's leading shoe retailers at the time. [[Hickory Farms]] had a location in Eastmont Mall, and there were also branches of Smiths and [[Roos/Atkins]], both popular regional men's clothing stores. The mall also housed a [[Century Theatres|Syufy]] movie theater, opened in 1971, with four screens. Food choices included [[Orange Julius]], [[Karmelkorn]] and the [[H. Salt Esquire]] fast-food seafood chain.

The Safeway store was actually part of the first phase of the mall, a freestanding location fronting Bancroft Avenue, and opened in the spring of 1966. The other stores adjacent to it were opened by 1967. The JCPenney wing began construction in 1968.&lt;ref name="MallHallofFame" /&gt;

Eastmont's JCPenney store was notable in that the signage for it, outdoors and at the inside entrances, was never converted to the "JCPenney" logo, rendered in the [[Helvetica]] font, introduced chain-wide in 1970 and installed in all subsequently built Bay Area locations (including [[Richmond, California|Richmond]]'s [[Hilltop Mall]]); the Eastmont location always retained the older "Penneys" logo as originally introduced in 1963, right up until the store shut down (all signage and advertising inside the store itself always conformed to then-current branding). This may have been intentionally done by JCPenney to protect the trademark on the older logo.

Eastmont Mall became the only remaining indoor mall in Oakland after the closure of the [[MacArthur-Broadway Center]] in [[North Oakland, California|North Oakland]] in the mid-1990s.
[[File:Oakland Chevrolet factory c.1917.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chevrolet]] automobile plant production, ca 1917, [[San Leandro Hills]] in background.]]
JCPenney and Mervyns closed their Eastmont locations in the early 1990s. In the early 2000s, the mall was only 30 percent leased and had fallen into bankruptcy. Local real estate developers purchased the mall in 2000, and emphasized a focus on neighborhood and community services; many of the abandoned retail stores were converted into office space. The Mervyns location was converted into a substation for the [[Oakland Police Department (California)|Oakland Police Department]] and the JCPenney location was converted into a joint City of Oakland/[[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]] social services center. A handful of existing retail tenants stayed on, and a few new ones were attracted due to the success of the renovations, including Gazzali's Market (opened 2004), the only supermarket to serve the surrounding neighborhoods (this supermarket was a [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]], as noted above, during the center's earliest years). In the spring of 2007, the mall was sold to a group of real estate investors based in Oregon.

A $6 million renovation of the property was completed in July 2008. The interior was brightened, new lighting, skylights and seating areas were installed, escalators and elevators were given an upgrade and the parking areas received new landscaping.

Currently, the mall houses the supermarket, a [[Social Security Administration|Social Security]] office, a branch of the [[Oakland Public Library]], a primary care medical clinic operated by the [[Alameda County Medical Center]], [[General Assistance]] and [[WIC]] offices, and other small businesses and social service organizations.

Eastmont was sold for 54.5 million in 2015 to Vertical Ventures, a private equity investment firm based in Walnut Creek.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.theregistrysf.com/vertical-ventures-announces-the-purchase-of-eastmont-town-center-in-oakland-ca/|title=Vertical Ventures Announces the Purchase of Eastmont Town Center in Oakland, CA - The Registry|date=2015-03-27|website=The Registry|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bus station==
The Eastmont Transit Center [[bus station]] adjacent to the mall opened on March 4, 2001. The Eastmont Transit Center is the second largest bus station in [[East Oakland, Oakland, California|East Oakland]] after [[Fruitvale station]], serving 15 routes that carry over 25,000 passengers a day combined.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.alamedactc.org/files/managed/Document/16546/Existing_Conditions_Market_Analysis_Task2.pdf Appendix A Performance Data for Transit Operators Serving Alameda County June 2015 (Starts at Page A-1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''T. Edward "Ed" Austin Jr.''' (July 15, 1926 – April 23, 2011) was an [[United States|American]] [[politician]] and [[Lawyer|attorney]]. He served as [[List of mayors of Jacksonville, Florida|mayor]] of [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Florida]] from 1991 to 1995. He also served as the first [[Public Defender]] for Florida's [[Fourth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida|Fourth Judicial Circuit]] from 1963 to 1968, and served as [[State Attorney]] for the Fourth Judicial Circuit from 1969 to 1972 and again from 1974 to 1991. Austin was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] for most of his career, but switched parties to become a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] during his term as mayor, becoming the first Republican to serve in that position since the [[Reconstruction era]].

==Early life==
Austin was born in [[Shenandoah, Virginia]]. In 1944 he enrolled at [[Duke University]], where he played [[college football]] as a [[tight end]] and ran [[track and field|track]] for the [[Duke Blue Devils]]. He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|bachelor's degree]] and a [[Master of Arts|master's degree]] while at Duke, and was subsequently employed as a teacher. He later joined the [[United States Army]], where he served in the [[101st Airborne Division]] as a [[paratrooper]].&lt;ref name=FORMER&gt;{{cite news |title= Former Jacksonville mayor Ed Austin preached fairness, justice|author= Mary Kelli Palka|url= http://jacksonville.com/news/florida/2011-04-23/story/former-jacksonville-mayor-ed-austin-preached-fairness-justice|newspaper= [[The Florida Times-Union]]|date= April 23, 2011|accessdate=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austin was hospitalized with a back injury; in the hospital he met his future wife, Patricia Lynch, an Army social worker.&lt;ref name=OBIT /&gt; In 1957, he was honorably discharged as a [[First Lieutenant]], and relocated to attend law school at the [[University of Florida]].&lt;ref name=FORMER/&gt;

==Career==
Austin received a [[juris doctor]] from the [[Fredric G. Levin College of Law|UF College of Law]] in 1958, and was admitted to the Florida Bar on November 6, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.floridabar.org/names.nsf/0/9DAC71284618F65185256A82007847C3?OpenDocument "T Edward Austin Jr."] Florida Bar website, Find a Lawyer&lt;/ref&gt;
He worked in several legal positions, including a stint as [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]]'s assistant solicitor. In 1963, he was appointed by Governor [[Farris Bryant]]&lt;ref name=OBIT&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/timesunion/obituary.aspx?n=t-edward-austin&amp;pid=150600167 "T. Edward Austin"] Florida Times-Union, April 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; as the first [[Public Defender]] for Florida's [[Fourth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida|Fourth Judicial Circuit]], which consists of Duval, [[Nassau County, Florida|Nassau]], and [[Clay County, Florida|Clay]] Counties. In 1969, he was elected State Attorney for the Fourth Judicial Circuit. [[Jacksonville]] Mayor [[Hans Tanzler]] appointed Austin to serve as the city's General Counsel in 1972, but he returned to the State Attorney position in 1974 and was re-elected four times.&lt;ref name=FORMER /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flacls.org/goldin-archive/goldin-1991.html Goldin 1991] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115160915/http://flacls.org/goldin-archive/goldin-1991.html |date=2011-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 Austin resigned his position as State Attorney to run against incumbent mayor [[Tommy Hazouri]], and won the election narrowly. His most lasting contribution as mayor is his [[River City Renaissance]] program, which funded [[urban renewal]] and revamped the city's historic downtown neighborhoods. Among the buildings constructed or renovated by the program are the [[Times-Union Center for the Performing Arts]], the [[Sulzbacher Center]], the stadium now known as [[EverBank Field]], and the [[Jacksonville Zoo]]. Austin oversaw the city's purchase and refurbishing of the [[St. James Building]], which would eventually become Jacksonville's new [[city hall]]. He was mayor at the time Jacksonville was awarded its [[National Football League]] franchise, the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]].&lt;ref name=FORMER /&gt; His support was instrumental in the founding of the Jacksonville Children's Commission and growth of the [[Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref name=PAT&gt;Patton, Charlie: [http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2011-04-28/story/former-mayor-ed-austin-remembered-uncanny-moral-compass "Former Mayor Ed Austin remembered for 'uncanny moral compass'] Florida Times-Union, April 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

During his term as mayor he switched his party affiliation from Democrat to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]; according to his chief of staff [[John Delaney (Florida politician)|John Delaney]], he told his staff before leaving on a trip to [[China]] that he had become so disenchanted with the Democrats that he did not want to die as one if his plane crashed.&lt;ref name=FORMER /&gt; In 1994, he announced he would not seek a second term as mayor. In the subsequent election he backed Delaney, who defeated former mayor [[Jake Godbold]] to become the next mayor of Jacksonville.

Austin was an imposing figure, a "strapping John Wayne-kind of guy", according to Delaney, who first worked for Austin as an intern in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=FORMER /&gt; His staff considered him a fair man with integrity and character who motivated his co-workers and mentored those he hired.&lt;ref name=FORMER /&gt; Numerous individuals Austin hired and mentored went on to leadership positions in Jacksonville and the state of Florida, including Delaney, currently President of the [[University of North Florida]]; former Chief Justice Leander Shaw of the [[Florida Supreme Court]], former general counsel Rick Mullaney, state Representative [[Mike Weinstein]], Circuit Judge Brian Davis, [[Sulzbacher Center]] President Audrey Moran, and Chief Administrator [[Lex Hester]].&lt;ref name=FORMER /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landeros, Monica: [http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/local/article/201809/3/Update-Former-Jax-Mayor-Austin-was-Caring-Mentor-True-Statesman- "Former Jacksonville Mayor Ed Austin was 'Caring Mentor', 'True Statesman'"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120730120920/http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/local/article/201809/3/Update-Former-Jax-Mayor-Austin-was-Caring-Mentor-True-Statesman- |date=2012-07-30 }} First Coast News, April 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TRUE /&gt;

==Alkylphenol ethoxylates and alkylphenols==
Alkylphenol [[ethoxylate]]s are widely used nonionic [[detergent]]s for domestic and industrial use.  They are susceptible to microbial or photochemical degradation into alkylphenols: [[lipophilic]], hormone mimicking compounds.&lt;ref name="Warhurst"/&gt;  Endocrine disruption of alkylphenols was evidenced by research affirming cell proliferation in cells treated with alkylphenols, a response usually generated by oestradiol binding. Further investigation revealed that hormone mimicking alkylphenols affiliate with the oestradiol receptor and averts the proper binding and function of oestradiol. Male trout in alkylphenol contaminated rivers showed reduced testicular growth and synthesized 570,000 times more [[vitellogenin]] than did control male trout. The astonishing quantity of [[vitellogenin]], a precursor of lipo- and phosphoproteins that make up egg-yolk protein, in the male trout population from River Lea of England exceeded that of females just before ovulation.&lt;ref name=Warhurst/&gt;

===Government regulation===
Since the discovery of its adverse effects on an organism’s endocrine system, the United Kingdom phased out the use of APEs as cleaning agents since 2000. To date, there are no regulations regarding the use or removal of APEs.&lt;ref name="Warhurst"/&gt;

==Environmentally benign alternatives==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}
[[Green cleaning]] uses are directly extracted from natural sources and biodegrade into innocuous compounds. Naturally occurring substances that may replace synthetic cleaning products include [[vinegar]], [[lemon juice]] and [[baking soda]]. For example, lemon juice may be used as a degreaser.&lt;ref name="sarah"/&gt;

With the aim of decreasing net efficiency, some brands of [[laundry detergent]] have been reformulated for use with cold water. By allowing the consumer to use cold water rather than hot, each load cuts back significantly on energy costs.&lt;ref name=tide&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Andrew|title=For a Few, Focus on Green Products Pays Off|date=2011|url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/rebound-for-product-makers-with-green-focus/?ref=energy-environment|publisher=The New York Times|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2-Butoxylethanol, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (EGBE)===
[[2-Butoxyethanol]] is a common glycol ether used as a solvent in carpet, hard-surface, glass, and oven cleaners owing to its surfactant properties. It is a relatively cheap, volatile solvent of low toxicity.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Siegfried Rebsdat, Dieter Mayer "Ethylene Glycol" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2000. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.a10_101}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has the further advantage of not bioaccumulating.&lt;ref name=ATSDR}&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Health Statement for 2-Butoxyethanol and 2-Butoxyethanol Acetate |url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=345&amp;tid=61l|publisher=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Fersommling''' (plural, '''Fersommlinge''') (also spelled '''[https://www.padutchdictionary.com/#d=Versammling Versammling]''' or '''Fersammling''') is a [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] social event in which food is served, speeches are made, and one or more ''g'spiel'' (plays or skits) are performed for entertainment. "A high degree of theatricality and ceremony is involved, especially in the groundhog lodges: pledging loyalty to the lodge and the groundhog, listening to a weather report, singing patriotic songs in [[Pennsylvania German language|Deitsch]], and ending every meeting by asking God to allow them to keep their way of life and their merriment."  as described by William W. Donner.&lt;ref name="Donner William W."&gt;{{cite book|last1=Donner|first1=William W.|title=Serious Nonsense|date=2016|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, PA|isbn=978-0-271-07118-3|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these traditions is the singing of the German folk song "[[Schnitzelbank]]"&lt;ref name="Donner William W." /&gt;  and the patriotic "[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]", in [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]], as translated by [[John Birmelin]]. &lt;ref name="rosenberger"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosenberger |first=Homer Tope |title=The Pennsylvania Germans: 1891-1965 |location=[[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster, PA]] |publisher=[[Pennsylvania German Society]] |year=1966 |pages=194–199 |oclc=1745108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  " there is continual creativity, as current events are incorporated into the versammling performances, speeches, and skits." &lt;ref name="Donner William W." /&gt; 

Fersommlinge are typically attended by the [[Fancy Dutch]], as opposed to the "Plain sects" of the [[Amish]], [[Church of the Brethren|Brethren]] and [[Mennonites]]. The term literally means "a congregation," not in the sense of a group of church-goers, but as a "social gathering of people." Fersommlinge are not religious functions, though many churches and church groups hosted the events and used them to raise money. The Pennsylvania German [[dialect]] is the only language spoken at the event, and those who speak [[English language|English]] pay a penalty, usually in the form of a [[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]], [[Dime (United States coin)|dime]] or [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]], per word spoken, put into a bowl in the center of the table.&lt;ref name="rosenberger"/&gt;  

The first Fersommling was held by Dr. John I. Woodruff of [[Susquehanna University]] in 1933.&lt;ref name="rosenberger"/&gt;  Shortly afterward, on March 13, 1933, a second was held in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], [[Pennsylvania]] at the home of [[William S. Troxell]], who wrote a daily [[Column (newspaper)|column]] on Pennsylvania German [[culture]] for the Allentown ''[[The Morning Call|Morning Call]]'' under the [[pseudonym]] "Pumpernickle Bill."  The purpose of the gathering was to plan the formation of the first [[Grundsow Lodge|Grundsow (Groundhog) Lodge]]. On the next [[Groundhog day|Groundhog Day]], February 2, 1934, the first Fersommling of Grundsow Lodge Nummer Ains an Da Lechaw (Number One on the Lehigh) took place in [[Northampton, Pennsylvania|Northampton]], Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kutztown.edu/community/pgchc/grundsau%20lodge%202007%20june.pdf |last=Miller |first=Richard K. |title=Pennsylvania German Groundhog Lodges |date=June 2007 |publisher=Pennsylvania German Cultural Heritage Center, [[Kutztown University of Pennsylvania|Kutztown University]] ([[Kutztown, Pennsylvania|Kutztown, PA]]) |pages=1 |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2008-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010101745/http://www.kutztown.edu/community/pgchc/grundsau%20lodge%202007%20june.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kutztown.edu/community/pgchc/News/Pdf/news005fall1994.pdf |last=Shupp |first=Col.

Fersommlinge continue to be held throughout eastern Pennsylvania as a means of preserving the Pennsylvania German dialect and culture. For example, the [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]] Fersommling, which started in 1937, annually attracts more than 700 participants, most of whom are of Pennsylvania German [[ancestor|ancestry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://drum.umd.edu/dspace/bitstream/1903/8029/1/umi-umd-5164.pdf |title=Current Trends of Dialect Preservation through Musical Performance in the Pennsylvania German Community of Southeastern Pennsylvania |last=Yadush |first=Chantel Lynn |year=2008 |publisher=[[University of Maryland, College Park]] ([[College Park, Maryland|College Park, MD]]) |pages=55 |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2008-07-09 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Devlin |first=Ron |url=http://readingeagle.com/Article.aspx?id=30412 |title=Dialect spoken, and that's no tripe |publisher=''[[Reading Eagle]]'' ([[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading PA]]) |date=April 16, 2007 |accessdate=2008-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427203627/http://www.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=30412 |archivedate=April 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1997, some of the texts presented at Fersommlinge are also published in the Pennsylvania German newspaper [[Hiwwe wie Driwwe]]. Current Fersommling and Grundsau lodge information is kept up to date at [http://groundhoglodge.org/ groundhoglodge.org] and the [http://www.pgs.org/ Pennsylvania German Society]

'''Filipino Mexicans''' are [[Demographics of Mexico|Mexican]] citizens who are descendants of [[Filipino people|Filipino]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005838/http://www.ezilon.com/cgi-bin/information/exec/view.cgi?archive=1&amp;num=476]&lt;/ref&gt; The actual population of Filipino descendants is not known, but there are approximately 1,200 Filipino nationals residing in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://mb.com.ph/issues/2005/01/28/OPED2005012827368.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209140532/http://mb.com.ph/issues/2005/01/28/OPED2005012827368.html |archive-date=2009-02-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Mexico|Viceroyalty of New Spain}}
Most of their Filipino ancestors arrived in Mexico during the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period]]. For two and a half centuries, between 1565 and 1815, many Filipinos and Mexicans sailed to and from [[Mexico]] and the [[Philippines]] as sailors, crews, slaves, prisoners, adventurers and soldiers in the [[Manila Galleon|Manila-Acapulco Galleon]] assisting [[Spain]] in its trade between [[Asia]] and the [[Americas]]. Some of these sailors never returned to the Philippines. Most settled in and [[Social integration|integrated]] into the Mexican society. In the late 19th and early 20th century some Filipinos came to Mexico as refugees from Spain during [[Francisco Franco]]’s dictatorship.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} These Filipinos were descendants of Filipino and [[Filipino mestizo]] settlers who entered Spain after the [[Spanish–American War]].

Smaller waves of Filipino migration to Mexico took place in the late 19th and 20th centuries after the Philippines was annexed by the [[United States of America|U.S.]] during the Spanish–American War of 1898–1900. A number of Filipino farm laborers and fishermen arrived to work in the Mexican west coast. These areas included the [[Baja California]], [[Sonora]] and [[Sinaloa]], while some had awaited to enter the United States to reunite with family members in [[Filipino American]] communities in California, and elsewhere. Mexican immigration law continues to grant special status for Filipinos.

Their descendants are found in communities particularly in the state of [[Guerrero]], and [[Colima]]. Most of these individuals are mixed blood peoples, and trace half or a quarter of their ancestry and origin back to the Philippines during the Manila-Acapulco Galleon period.

Today, newly arrived Filipinos are overseas or contract workers who came to Mexico to obtain employment. Most of these individuals speak at least one of the [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]].

==Notable Mexicans of Filipino descent==

* [[Romeo Tabuena]] – painter and printmaker
* [[Alejandro Gómez Maganda]] – Governor of Guerrero (1951–1954)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11888">'''The First National Conference of the Colored Women of America''' was a three-day conference in [[Boston]] organized by  [[Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin]], a [[civil rights]] leader and [[suffragist]]. In August 1895, representatives from 42 African-American women's clubs from 14 states convened at Berkeley Hall for the purpose of creating a national organization. It was the first event of its kind in the United States.

Speakers included [[Margaret Murray Washington]] (the wife of [[Booker T. Washington]]), author and former slave [[Victoria Earle Matthews]], anti-lynching activist [[Ida B. Wells]], scholar [[Anna J. Cooper]], civil rights leader [[T. Thomas Fortune]], and social reformers [[Henry B. Blackwell]] and [[William Lloyd Garrison]]. The National Federation of Afro-American Women, which became the [[National Association of Colored Women's Clubs|National Association of Colored Women]] the following year, was organized during the conference.

==History==

===Background===

In 1892, Boston activist [[Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin]] founded the [[Woman's Era Club]], an advocacy group for black women, with the help of her daughter, [[Florida Ruffin Ridley]], and educator [[Maria Louise Baldwin]]. It was the first black women's club in [[Boston]],&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Jessie Carney|title=Notable Black American Women|date=1996|publisher=VNR AG|isbn=9780810391772|page=240|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ssMBzqrUpjwC&amp;pg=PA240}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the first in the country. Its members, prominent black women from the Boston area, devoted their efforts to education, [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]], and race-related issues such as [[Anti-lynching movement|anti-lynching]] reform. Its slogan was "Help to make the world better".&lt;ref name="Neal1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Neal|first1=Anthony W.|title=Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin: A pioneer in the black women’s club movement Part 1|url=http://baystatebanner.com/news/2016/feb/03/josephine-st-pierre-ruffin-pioneer-black-womens-cl/|agency=The Bay State Banner|date=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Woman's Era]]'', an illustrated monthly publication, was the club's newspaper.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jenkins|first1=Maude T.|title=Letters|journal=The Women's Review of Books|publisher=Old City Publishing, Inc.|volume=16|issue=12|date=1999|jstor=4023208|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1890s, when the ''Woman's Era'' polled readers to see if there was a need for a national organization of black clubwomen, the response was overwhelmingly positive.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt; In 1895, an obscure Missouri journalist named John Jacks sent a letter to the secretary of the British [[Anti-Slavery Society]], Florence Belgarnie.

The first day was to be devoted to the business of organizing, and the second and third to "vital questions concerning our moral, mental, physical and financial growth and well-being." In the call, Ruffin explained the choice of venue:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Boston has been selected as a meeting place because it has seemed to be the general opinion that here, and here only, can be found the atmosphere which would best interpret and represent us, our position, our needs, and our aims.&lt;ref name="HR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Records of Conventions of 1895-96 of the Colored Women of America|url=https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/ead/pdf/ibwells-0009-006.pdf|website=University of Chicago Library|date=1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Conference===

On July 29, 1895, representatives of 42 black women's clubs from 14 states&amp;mdash;including the Colored Women's League of Washington, the Women's Loyal Union of New York, and the Ida B. Wells Club of Chicago&amp;mdash;gathered in Berkeley Hall for the First National Conference of the Colored Women of America, with Josephine Ruffin presiding.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; They convened at the hall for three days, with an extra session on August 1 at the [[Charles Street African Methodist Episcopal Church|Charles Street Church]].&lt;ref name="HR" /&gt; According to the ''New York Times'', it was "the first movement of the kind ever attempted".&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news|ref={{harvid|Times|July 30, 1895}}|title=Colored Women in Conference – National Association for Their Betterment Formed in Boston|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9804E4D8103DE433A25753C3A9619C94649ED7CF&amp;legacy=true|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 29, 1895|page=6|access-date=October 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her opening address, Ruffin explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our woman's movement is woman's movement in that it is led and directed by women for the good of women and men, for the benefit of all humanity, which is more than any one branch or section of it. We want, we ask the active interest of our men, and, too, we are not drawing the color line; we are women, American women, as intensely interested in all that pertains to us as such as all other American women.&lt;ref name="HR" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several notable speakers addressed the group. Margaret Murray Washington, the wife of [[Booker T. Washington]], gave an influential speech titled "Individual Work for Moral Elevation". African-American women, she said, were divided into two classes: those who "had the opportunity to improve and develop mentally, physically, morally, spiritually and financially" and those who had been deprived of that opportunity by slavery. She urged members of the former class to do all they could to uplift and inspire the latter, reasoning that individual success was not enough; that only by "lifting as we climb" was it possible for the race to make progress.&lt;ref name="Neal2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Neal|first1=Anthony W.|title=Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin: A pioneer in the black women’s club movement Part 2|url=http://baystatebanner.com/news/2016/feb/18/josephine-st-pierre-ruffin-pioneer-black-womens-cl/|agency=The Bay State Banner|date=February 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ella L. Smith, the first African-American woman to receive an M.A. degree from [[Wellesley College]], spoke about the need for higher education. Noted scholar [[Anna J. Cooper]] spoke about the need to organize. In "The Value of Race Literature", author and former slave [[Victoria Earle Matthews]] stressed the importance of collecting literature by and about African Americans. [[Agnes Jones Adams]] gave a speech titled "Social Purity" in which she asserted that being white was not a "criterion for being American".&lt;ref name="Gere2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Intimate Practices: Literacy and Cultural Work in U.S. Women's Clubs, 1880-1920|last = Gere|first = Anne Ruggles|publisher = University of Illinois Press|year = 1997|isbn = 9780252066047|location = Urbana|pages = 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil rights leader [[T. Thomas Fortune]] and social reformers [[Henry B. Blackwell]] and [[William Lloyd Garrison]] spoke about political equality.&lt;ref name="HR" /&gt; [[John F.

===The National Federation of Afro-American Women===

The National Federation of Afro-American Women (NFAAW) was organized during the conference, and its mission defined as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) the concentration of the dormant energies of the women of the Afro-American race into one broad band of sisterhood: for the purpose of establishing needed reforms, and the practical encouragement of all efforts being put forth by various agencies, religious, educational, ethical and otherwise, for the upbuilding, ennobling and advancement of the race; (2) to awaken the women of the race to the great need of systematic effort in home-making and the divinely imposed duties of motherhood.&lt;ref name="HR" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Delegates from the conference were elected officers for the organization, and were Margaret Murray Washington (President),  Florida Ruffin Ridley (Cor. Sec.), L. C. Carter (Rec. Sec.), Libby B. Anthony (Treasurer), Mary Dickerson, Helen Crum, and [[Ella Mahammitt]] (Vice Presidents). Ruffin was nominated for treasurer but refused the position. ''The Woman's Era'' was designated as the organization's news outlet.&lt;ref name="HR" /&gt; The NFAAW held another conference in 1896, when it merged with other groups to form the [[National Association of Colored Women's Clubs|National Association of Colored Women]].&lt;ref name="Neal2" /&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Francis Place.jpg|thumb|Francis Place portrait.]]
'''Francis Place''' (3 November 1771 in [[London]] – 1 January 1854 in London) was an [[England|English]] [[Reform movement|social reformer]].

==Early career and influence==
He was the illegitimate son of Simon Place and Mary Gray, and had a rough upbringing; his father ran a London [[sponging-house]] in Vinegar Yard, near [[Drury Lane]], and Place was born there. He was schooled to 1785 before being apprenticed to a leather-breeches maker in [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=22349|first=William|last=Thomas|title=Place, Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At eighteen Place was an independent journeyman, and in 1790 was married to Elizabeth Chad&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/subsites/visitkensingtonandchelsea/seedo/people/blueplaques/recordsp-s/francisplace.aspx|title=Francis Place|website=www.rbkc.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they moved to a house near the Strand. In 1793 he became involved in and eventually the leader of a strike of leather-breeches makers, and was refused work for several years by London's master tailors; he exploited this time by reading avidly and widely. In 1794, Place joined the [[London Corresponding Society]], a reform club, and for three years was prominent in its work, before resigning his post as chairman of the general committee in 1797 in protest at the violent tactics and rhetoric of some group members. In 1799 he became the partner in a tailor's shop, and a year later set up his own highly successful business at 16 Charing Cross.

==Energetic Radical==
[[File:Francis Place.jpg|thumb|200px|Francis Place portrait by [[Daniel Maclise]].]]
Withdrawing from politics whilst he established his business, he devoted three hours an evening after work to studying, eventually establishing such a large personal library in the back of his shop that it soon became a meeting place for radicals. In 1807 he supported [[Sir Francis Burdett, 5th Baronet]], a Parliamentary candidate for Westminster, which allowed him to come into contact with such theorists as [[William Godwin]], [[James Mill]], [[Robert Owen]], [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[Joseph Hume]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]. When Place retired in 1817 (with a steady stream of income from his shop, now run by his children), he lived for several months with Bentham and the Mills at [[Forde Abbey]].

It was around this time that he became involved in the movement for organised, public education, believing it to be a means of eradicating the ills of the working class. In the early 1820s he also became a [[Malthusianism|Malthusian]], believing that as the population increased it would outstrip the food supply. He successfully associated [[Thomas Malthus|Malthus]] with the idea of [[birth control]] (which Malthus himself had opposed despite his fears of overpopulation). Despite himself having fathered fifteen children, he advocated the use of contraception, although was not specific about in what forms. It was on this topic that he wrote his only published book, the influential and controversial ''Illustrations and Proofs of the Principles of Population,'' in 1822.&lt;ref name="spartacus"&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.spartacus-educational.com/CHplace.htm | title=Francis Place | work=Spartacus Educational | accessdate=2007-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stack98"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stack|first=David|title=Nature and Artifice|year=1998|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=0861932293|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest national birth control organization was founded in [[England]] in 1877 as a result of his thinking and activities.{{CN|date=November 2017}}  

Place also lobbied successfully for the 1824 [[repeal]] of the [[Combination Act]], which helped early [[Trade Unionism]], though new restrictions were soon introduced.  Oddly, Place himself regarded Trade Unionism as a delusion that workers would soon forget about if they were allowed to try it.&lt;ref name="spartacus"/&gt;
[[file:Louisa Chatterley as Lady Teazle in The School for Scandal by Rose Emma Drummond 1835.jpg|thumb|left|Louisa Chatterley in 1835]]
In 1827 he entered a long period of depression after the death of his wife from cancer. In February 1830 he married [[Louisa Chatterley]], a London actress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also in this year, Place helped support [[Rowland Detrosier]], a [[working class]] radical activist who also sought to distance himself from [[socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, M. (2004) "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7559 Detrosier, Rowland (1800?–1834)]", ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, accessed 10 Aug 2007 (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; Through Place, Detrosier would be introduced to figures such as Bentham and J.S. Mill, who in turn introduced him to [[Thomas Carlyle]]. Detrosier's activities and writings would be influential amongst Manchester Radicals and the later [[Chartism|Chartists]]. He was also active in the agitation that led to the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act of 1832]], holding up the recent [[French Revolution of 1830|revolution in Paris]] as an example of what could happen if reform wasn't allowed by legal means.

== Moral-force Chartist and old age ==

Having lost much of his money in 1833 in bad investments, Place had to move from Charing Cross to [[Brompton Square]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and lost his regular contact with the Reformist middle-class. However, he remained politically active, working against the [[stamp tax]] and involving himself in the [[London Working Men's Association]], within which in 1838 he and [[William Lovett]] drafted the document that would become the [[Chartism|People's Charter]]. It then became evident that many Chartists were willing to use violent means, and when [[Feargus O'Connor]] replaced Lovett as the effective leader of the movement, Place ceased to be involved in Chartist activities.&lt;ref name="spartacus"/&gt; On rescinding his involvement with the Chartists, he became involved in the movement to repeal the [[Corn Laws]].

For the next two decades he wrote his autobiography and organised the immense collection he had made: notes, pamphlets, newspapers and letters. In 1851 he separated from his wife and on 1 January 1854 died in the home of his two unmarried daughters in Hammersmith.

Place is listed on the Reformers Memorial in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] in [[London]].

==Legacy==
His pamphlets, letters, magazine and newspaper articles throw light on the social and economic history of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Thomas (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; His hoarding of documents create an important archive. The [[British Library]] currently holds these documents in fifty-four reels of micro-film as the [[Francis Place Collection]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/microform/francisplace/index.html.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11087">'''Government cheese''' is [[processed cheese]] provided to [[welfare]] beneficiaries, [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|Food Stamp recipients]] and the elderly receiving Social Security in the [[United States]], and is still provided to food charities. The processed cheese was used in military kitchens since [[World War II]] and in schools since as early as the 1950s.

Government cheese is a commodity cheese that was controlled by the U.S. federal government from the time World War II ended and into the early 1980s. Government cheese was created to maintain the price of dairy when [[Agricultural subsidy|dairy industry subsidies]] artificially increased the supply of milk and created a [[overproduction|surplus]] of milk that was then converted into cheese, butter, or [[powdered milk]]. The cheese, along with the butter and dehydrated powder, was stored in over 150 warehouses across 35 states.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRnGDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA325&amp;lpg=PA325&amp;dq=cheese+surplus+1980&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EKeTl3r0U6&amp;sig=wkSTocwrHvZw2F-FXzA7f8Ch0Ow&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiI84bVza_TAhUFVyYKHQSpD6Y4ChDoAQgiMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cheese%20surplus%201980&amp;f=false|title=The Oxford Companion to Cheese|date=2016-10-25|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199330898|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and impact ==
The cheese was bought and stored by the government's [[Commodity Credit Corporation]]. Direct distribution of dairy products began in 1982 under the [[Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program]] of the [[Food and Nutrition Service]]. According to the government, it "slices and melts well."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.fns.usda.gov/fdd/facts/hhpfacts/FS-CheeseProcessed.pdf All Purpose&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924120852/http://www.fns.usda.gov/fdd/facts/hhpfacts/FS-CheeseProcessed.pdf |date=September 24, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cheese was provided monthly, in unsliced block form, with [[Generic brand|generic product]] labeling and packaging.

The cheese was often from food surpluses stockpiled by the government as part of milk [[price support]]s. [[Butter]] was also stockpiled and then provided under the same program. Some government cheese was made of [[Kashrut|kosher]] products.&lt;ref name=usda2/&gt; This cheese product is also distributed to victims of a natural disaster following a [[State of emergency#United States|state of emergency]] declaration.

This cheese became an important topic for the press in the 1980s when the press learned about the milk products that were being stored across the nation while millions of Americans felt [[food security|food insecurity]]. During the same time in the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan's administration cut the budget on the national food stamp program in the United States.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

On December 22, 1981 President Ronald Reagan signed and authorized into law that {{convert|560|e6lbs|MT|spell=in|abbr=off}} of cheese that the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) had been stockpiled should be released, saying that it ...

&lt;blockquote&gt;"... will be distributed free to the needy by nonprofit organizations." Ronald Reagan, in his official statement about the distribution of the Cheese Inventory of the Commodity Credit Corporation, said, "The 1981 farm bill I signed today will slow the rise in price support levels, but even under this bill, surpluses will continue to pile up. A total of more than 560 million pounds of cheese has already been consigned to warehouses, so more distributions may be necessary as we continue our drive to root out waste in government and make the best possible use of our nation's resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=43377|title=Ronald Reagan: Statement About Distribution of the Cheese Inventory of the Commodity Credit Corporation|website=www.presidency.ucsb.edu|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the bill stated, any state that would ask for the cheese would get {{convert|30|e6lb|MT|abbr=off}} of it, in {{convert|5|lb|kg|adj=on}} blocks. The bill was approved in the House by a margin of two votes; in the Senate it had a much larger approval rate. The logic behind the distribution was to effectively remove waste and to use all possible resources available in the United States. One representative from the USDA remarked that, "Probably the cheapest and most practical thing would be to dump it in the ocean."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/food/1981/12/17/the-big-cheese-storing-the-surplus/0e54d36a-4bd9-416a-a773-55d40ea8fd74/|title=The Big Cheese: Storing the Surplus|last=Fritschner|first=Sarah|date=1981-12-17|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-04-26|last2=gr|first2=Washington Post Staff Writer WW HAT COSTS upwards of $3 per pound in the|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|last3=Fritschner|first3=Sarah|last4=gr|first4=Washington Post Staff Writer WW HAT COSTS upwards of $3 per pound in the}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution ==
The distribution of government cheese was claimed to not have an adverse effect on commercially available cheeses, as the government was required to purchase dairy products like cheese to keep the commercial companies afloat. The government could then sell or give the cheese away to foreign countries. At the time of Ronald Reagan's signing of the [[Agriculture and Food Act of 1981|1981 farm bill]], the cheese stockpile equaled to more than 2 pounds (1&amp;nbsp;kg) of cheese for each person living in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/23/us/surplus-cheese-goes-to-poor-as-president-signs-farm-bill.html|title=SURPLUS CHEESE GOES TO POOR AS PRESIDENT SIGNS FARM BILL|last=Ap|date=1981-12-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-26|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government cheese was frequently moldy.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Those who received the cheese did not lose any food stamps and were not required to trade their food stamps in for the cheese. California was the first state to take the cheese; the first delivery that they received was for {{convert|3|e6lb|t|spell=in}} of cheese.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Government cheese was provided to welfare, food stamp, and Social Security recipients at no cost to them. Government cheese was colored orange. It was distributed to low-income families through the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program. Government cheese was nominally removed in the 1990s when the dairy market stabilized.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shekhtman|first=Lonnie|date=2016|title=Why the US Government Wants Americans to Eat More Cheese|journal=Christian Science Monitor|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ingredients==
Like traditional processed [[American cheese]], it consists of a variety of cheese types and other ingredients such as [[Emulsion#Emulsifiers|emulsifiers]] blended together, and may be made of any of [[Cheddar cheese]], [[Colby cheese]], [[cheese curd]], or [[granular cheese]].&lt;ref name=usda2&gt;[http://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/pcd5.pdf USDA Commodity Requirements - PCD5 Pasteurized Process American Cheese for Use in Domestic Programs] - description of government cheese&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nutritional value ==
Government cheese has become a symbol for American innovation and industrialization, although the nutritional value of the cheese has been in question.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It has been argued that people in poverty, such as those entitled to government cheese, are more likely to become obese. Between 1988-1994, those individuals below the poverty line had an obesity rate of 29.2 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Correll|first=Michael|date=2010|title=Getting fat on government cheese: the connection between social welfare participation, gender, and obesity in America|url=|journal=Duke Journal of Gender Law &amp; Policy|volume=18|pages= 45+}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food Security Act of 1985]] (the 1985 [[United States farm bill|farm bill]]) attempted to reduce milk production, but has been labeled as a "hodgepodge of misdirected political compromise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/23/nyregion/us-offers-dairymen-a-buyout.html|title=U.S. OFFERS DAIRYMEN A BUYOUT|last=Hamilton|first=Robert A.|date=1986-03-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-26|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nutrition facts on government cheese suggests a serving size of {{convert|1|oz|g}}, or two slices, of cheese per serving. It also notes that the nutritional information represents the average nutritional value of "Processed American cheese" which was offered by the commodity food program. Per serving, the total fat content is 9&amp;nbsp;grams, of which 6&amp;nbsp;grams are [[saturated fat]]. Per serving, there are 30&amp;nbsp;mg of cholesterol and 380&amp;nbsp;mg of sodium.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Government cheese in the 21st century ==
On August 23, 2016, the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S Department of Agriculture]] released that they planned to purchase approximately {{convert|11000000|lb|tonne|spell=in}} of cheese,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fsa.usda.gov/news-room/news-releases/2016/nr_20160823_rel_0181|title=USDA to Purchase Surplus Cheese for Food Banks and Families in Need, Continue to Assist Dairy Producers|website=www.fsa.usda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; worth $20 million,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=|date=2016|title=US to Buy Cheese to Help Milk Prices and Feed the Poor|url=|journal=Farmers Weekly|volume=1123|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to give aid to [[Food bank|food banks and food pantries]] from across the United States,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; to reduce a $1.2 billion&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; cheese surplus that has been at its highest level in thirty years, and to stabilize farm prices.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This purchase also added revenues for the dairy producers. Regarding the purchase, [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Agriculture Secretary]] [[Tom Vilsack]] said, "This commodity purchase is part of a robust, comprehensive safety net that will help reduce a cheese surplus that is at a 30-year high while, at the same time, moving a high-protein food to the tables of those most in need. USDA will continue to look for ways within its authorities to tackle food insecurity and provide for added stability in the marketplace."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Currently, as part of the USDA Food Nutrition Service Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/csfp/Revised-Maximum-Monthly-Distribution-Rates.pdf|title=Commodity Supplemental Food Program|website=https://www.fns.usda.gov/csfp/commodity-supplemental-food-program-csfp}}&lt;/ref&gt; eligible Seniors over Age 60 are provided one 32 ounce block of processed cheese food each month supplied by participating dairies.

==Causes==

=== Human overpopulation ===
[[File:Population curve.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Human population from 10000 BCE to 2000 [[Common Era|CE]], with its exponential rise since the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Graphic: The relentless rise of carbon dioxide – Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet|last=|first=|date=|work=Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=]]
{{Main|Human overpopulation#Effects of human overpopulation}}

[[David Attenborough]] described the level of human population on the planet as a multiplier of all other environmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People and Planet speech|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=536&amp;v=fK0rXRmC4DQ|publisher=[[Royal Society of Arts]]|ref=at 13mins,30secs into speech}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, he described humanity as "a plague on the Earth" that needs to be controlled by limiting population growth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/earthnews/9815862/Humans-are-plague-on-Earth-Attenborough.html David Attenborough – Humans are plague on Earth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120085247/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/earthnews/9815862/Humans-are-plague-on-Earth-Attenborough.html |date=20 November 2016 }}. ''The Telegraph.'' 22 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Deep ecology|deep ecologists]], such as the radical thinker and polemicist [[Pentti Linkola]], see human overpopulation as a threat to the entire [[biosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Pentti Linkola, "Can Life Prevail?", Arktos Media, 2nd Revised ed. 2011. pp. 120–121. {{ISBN|1907166637}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, over 15,000 scientists around the world issued a second [[World Scientists' Warning to Humanity|warning to humanity]] which asserted that rapid human population growth is the "primary driver behind many ecological and even societal threats."&lt;ref name="WorldScientists"/&gt;

=== Overconsumption ===
{{Main|Overconsumption}}
[[File:NASA CO2 Chart.jpg|thumb|Chart published by NASA depicting CO2 levels from the past 400,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/24/graphic-the-relentless-rise-of-carbon-dioxide/|title=Graphic: The relentless rise of carbon dioxide – Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet|work=Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Overconsumption is a situation where resource use has outpaced the sustainable capacity of the ecosystem. It can be measured by the [[ecological footprint]], a resource accounting approach which compares human demand on ecosystems with the amount of planet matter ecosystems can renew. Estimates indicate that humanity's current demand is 70%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.footprintnetwork.org/#/countryTrends?cn=5001&amp;type=BCtot,EFCtot|title=Open Data Platform|website=data.footprintnetwork.org|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; higher than the regeneration rate of all of the planet's ecosystems combined. A prolonged pattern of overconsumption leads to environmental degradation and the eventual loss of resource bases.

Humanity's overall impact on the planet is affected by many factors, not just the raw number of people. Their lifestyle (including overall affluence and resource utilization) and the pollution they generate (including [[carbon footprint]]) are equally important. In 2008, ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that the inhabitants of the developed nations of the world consume resources like oil and metals at a rate almost 32 times greater than those of the developing world, who make up the majority of the human population.&lt;ref name="NYTimes_Diamond"&gt;Diamond, Jared: (2008-01-02). [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/opinion/02diamond.html "What's Your Consumption Factor?"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226011223/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/opinion/02diamond.html |date=26 December 2016 }} ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of overpopulation are compounded by [[overconsumption]]. According to [[Paul R. Ehrlich]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rich western countries are now siphoning up the planet’s resources and destroying its ecosystems at an unprecedented rate. We want to build highways across the Serengeti to get more rare earth minerals for our cellphones. We grab all the fish from the sea, wreck the coral reefs and put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. We have triggered a major extinction event [...] A world population of around a billion would have an overall pro-life effect. This could be supported for many millennia and sustain many more human lives in the long term compared with our current uncontrolled growth and prospect of sudden collapse [...] If everyone consumed resources at the US level – which is what the world aspires to – you will need another four or five Earths. We are wrecking our planet’s [[Ecosystem services|life support systems]].&lt;ref&gt;McKie, Robin. [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/25/half-all-species-extinct-end-century-vatican-conference Biologists say half of all species could be extinct by end of century] (February 2017), ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Technology===
The applications of technology often result in unavoidable and unexpected environmental impacts, which according to the [[I = PAT]] equation is measured as resource use or pollution generated per unit GDP. Environmental impacts caused by the application of technology are often perceived as unavoidable for several reasons. First, given that the purpose of many technologies is to exploit, control, or otherwise “improve” upon nature for the perceived benefit of humanity while at the same time the myriad of processes in nature have been optimized and are continually adjusted by evolution, any disturbance of these natural processes by technology is likely to result in negative environmental consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Commoner, B.

Knopf]].&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the conservation of mass principle and the [[first law of thermodynamics]] (i.e., conservation of energy) dictate that whenever material resources or energy are moved around or manipulated by technology, environmental consequences are inescapable. Third, according to the [[second law of thermodynamics]], order can be increased within a system (such as the human economy) only by increasing disorder or [[entropy]] outside the system (i.e., the environment). Thus, technologies can create “order” in the human economy (i.e., order as manifested in buildings, factories, transportation networks, communication systems, etc.) only at the expense of increasing “disorder” in the environment. According to a number of studies, increased entropy is likely to be correlated to negative environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;Faber, M., Niemes, N. and Stephan, G. (2012).

===Agriculture===
{{main article|Environmental impact of agriculture}}
The environmental impact of agriculture varies based on the wide variety of agricultural practices employed around the world. Ultimately, the environmental impact depends on the production practices of the system used by farmers. The connection between emissions into the environment and the farming system is indirect, as it also depends on other climate variables such as rainfall and temperature.

There are two types of indicators of environmental impact: "means-based", which is based on the farmer's production methods, and "effect-based", which is the impact that farming methods have on the farming system or on emissions to the environment. An example of a means-based indicator would be the quality of groundwater that is affected by the amount of [[Nitrogen fertilizers|nitrogen applied]] to the [[soil]].&lt;!-- this first example makes no sense to me. If you agree, I suggest to leave and indication here; or, if you can, rewrite it.--&gt; An indicator reflecting the loss of nitrate to groundwater would be effect-based.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van der Warf|first1=Hayo|last2=Petit|first2=Jean|title=Evaluation of the environmental impact of agriculture at the farm level: a comparison and analysis of 12 indicator-based methods|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment|date=December 2002|volume=93|issue=1–3|pages=131–145|doi=10.1016/S0167-8809(01)00354-1|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880901003541|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The environmental impact of agriculture involves a variety of factors from the soil, to water, the air, animal and soil diversity, plants, and the food itself. Some of the environmental issues that are related to agriculture are [[climate change]], [[deforestation]], genetic engineering, irrigation problems, pollutants, [[soil degradation]], and [[waste]].

====Fishing====
{{main article|Environmental impact of fishing}}
[[File:Fishing down the food web.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Fishing down the foodweb]]]]
The environmental impact of fishing can be divided into issues that involve the availability of fish to be caught, such as [[overfishing]], [[sustainable fisheries]], and [[fisheries management]]; and issues that involve the impact of fishing on other elements of the environment, such as [[by-catch]] and destruction of habitat such as [[coral reef]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food Choice and Sustainability|last=Oppenlander|first=Richard|publisher=Langdon Street Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-62652-435-4|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=120–123|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These conservation issues are part of [[marine conservation]], and are addressed in [[fisheries science]] programs. There is a growing gap between how many fish are available to be caught and humanity’s desire to catch them, a problem that gets worse as the [[world population]] grows.

Similar to other [[environmental issue]]s, there can be conflict between the [[fishermen]] who depend on fishing for their livelihoods and fishery scientists who realize that if future fish populations are to be [[sustainability|sustainable]] then some fisheries must reduce or even close.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Myers | first1 = R.

The journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' published a four-year study in November 2006, which predicted that, at prevailing trends, the world would run out of wild-caught [[seafood]] in 2048. The scientists stated that the decline was a result of [[overfishing]], [[pollution]] and other environmental factors that were reducing the population of fisheries at the same time as their ecosystems were being degraded. Yet again the analysis has met criticism as being fundamentally flawed, and many fishery management officials, industry representatives and scientists challenge the findings, although the debate continues. Many countries, such as [[Tonga]], the [[United States]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], and international management bodies have taken steps to appropriately manage marine resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

====Irrigation====
{{main article|Environmental impact of irrigation}}
[[File:IrrHydr.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6]]

The environmental impact of irrigation includes the changes in quantity and quality of [[soil]] and [[water]] as a result of [[irrigation]] and the ensuing effects on natural and social conditions at the tail-end and downstream of the irrigation scheme.

The impacts stem from the changed [[hydrology|hydrological conditions]] owing to the installation and operation of the scheme.

An irrigation scheme often draws water from the river and distributes it over the irrigated area. As a hydrological result it is found that:
* the downstream river [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] is reduced
* the [[evaporation]] in the scheme is increased
* the [[groundwater recharge]] in the scheme is increased
* the level of the [[watertable|water table]] rises
* the [[drainage]] flow is increased.
These may be called direct effects.

Effects on soil and [[water quality]] are indirect and complex, and subsequent impacts on natural, [[ecology|ecological]] and [[socio-economy|socio-economic]] conditions are intricate.  In some, but not all instances, [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|water logging]] and [[soil salinization]] can result.  However, irrigation can also be used, together with soil drainage, to overcome soil salinization by leaching excess salts from the vicinity of the root zone.&lt;ref&gt;FAO.  Management of irrigation-induced salt-affected soils.  ftp://ftp.fao.org/agl/agll/docs/salinity_brochure_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Hoorn, J. W. and J.G. van Alphen.  2006.  Salinity control. In: H.P. Ritzema (ed.), Drainage Principles and Applications.  Publication 16, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. pp. 533–600.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irrigation can also be done extracting groundwater by [[water well|(tube)wells]]. As a hydrological result it is found that the level of the water descends. The effects may be [[water mining]], land/soil [[Groundwater-related subsidence|subsidence]], and, along the coast, [[saltwater intrusion]].

Irrigation projects can have large benefits, but the negative side effects are often overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;''Effectiveness and Social/Environmental Impacts of Irrigation Projects: a Review''.

Agricultural irrigation technologies such as high powered water pumps, dams, and pipelines are responsible for the large-scale depletion of fresh water resources such as aquifers, lakes, and rivers.  As a result of this massive diversion of freshwater, lakes, rivers, and creeks are running dry, severely altering or stressing surrounding ecosystems, and contributing to the extinction of many aquatic species.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, R. (2006). When the rivers run dry: Water – the defining crisis of the twenty-first century, Beacon Press, {{ISBN|0807085731}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Agricultural land loss and soil erosion====

Lal and Stewart estimated global loss of agricultural land by degradation and abandonment at 12 million hectares per year.&lt;ref&gt;Lal, R. and B. A. Stewart.  1990. Soil degradation.  Springer-Verlag, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;    In contrast, according to Scherr, GLASOD (Global Assessment of Human-Induced Soil Degradation, under the UN Environment Programme) estimated that 6 million hectares of agricultural land per year had been lost to soil degradation since the mid-1940s, and she noted that this magnitude is similar to earlier estimates by Dudal and by Rozanov et al.&lt;ref&gt;Scherr, S. J.  1999.  Soil degradation: a threat to developing country food security by 2020?  International Food Policy Research Institute.  Washington, D. C.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such losses are attributable not only to [[soil erosion]], but also to salinization, loss of nutrients and organic matter, acidification, compaction, water logging and subsidence.&lt;ref&gt;Oldeman, L. R., R. T. A. Hakkeling and W. G. Sambroek.  1990.  World map of the status of human-induced soil degradation.  An explanatory note.  GLASOD, Global Assessment of Soil Degradation.    International Soil Reference and Information Centre, Wageningen.  http://www.isric.org/sites/default/files/ExplanNote_1.pdf G&lt;/ref&gt;  Human-induced land degradation tends to be particularly serious in dry regions. Focusing on soil properties, Oldeman estimated that about 19 million square kilometers of global land area had been degraded; Dregne and Chou, who included degradation of vegetation cover as well as soil, estimated about 36 million square kilometers degraded in the world’s dry regions.&lt;ref&gt;Eswaran, H., R. Lal and P. F. Reich.  2001.  Land degradation: an overview.  In.  Bridges, E.M. et al. (eds.) Responses to Land Degradation. Proc. 2nd. Int. Conf. Land Degradation and Desertification, Khon Kaen, Thailand. Oxford Press, New Delhi, India.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite estimated losses of agricultural land, the amount of arable land used in crop production globally increased by about 9% from 1961 to 2012, and is estimated to have been 1.396 billion hectares in 2012.&lt;ref name=FAOSTAT&gt;FAOSTAT. [Agricultural statistics database] Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome. http://faostat3.fao.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Global average soil erosion rates are thought to be high, and erosion rates on conventional cropland generally exceed estimates of soil production rates, usually by more than an order of magnitude.&lt;ref name=Montgomery2007&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Montgomery | first1 = D.

For 2010, annual average soil loss by sheet, rill and wind erosion on non-federal US land was estimated to be 10.7 t/ha on cropland and 1.9 t/ha on pasture land; the average soil erosion rate on US cropland had been reduced by about 34% since 1982.&lt;ref name=NRCS2013&gt;NRCS.  2013.   Summary report 2010 national resources inventory.   United States Natural Resources Conservation Service.   163 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; No-till and low-till practices have become increasingly common on North American cropland used for production of grains such as wheat and barley. On uncultivated cropland, the recent average total soil loss has been 2.2 t/ha per year.&lt;ref name=NRCS2013/&gt;  In comparison with agriculture using conventional cultivation, it has been suggested that, because no-till agriculture produces erosion rates much closer to soil production rates, it could provide a foundation for sustainable agriculture.&lt;ref name=Montgomery2007/&gt;

====Meat production====

Environmental impacts associated with meat production include use of fossil energy, water and land resources, greenhouse gas emissions, and in some instances, rainforest clearing, water pollution and species endangerment, among other adverse effects.&lt;ref name=Steinfeld2006&gt;Steinfeld, H. et al. 2006.

Globally, enteric fermentation (mostly in ruminant livestock) accounts for about 27% of anthropogenic [[methane emissions]],&lt;ref name=IPCC2013&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. (2013).

Considerable water use is associated with meat production, mostly because of water used in production of vegetation that provides feed.  There are several published estimates of water use associated with livestock and meat production, but the amount of water use assignable to such production is seldom estimated.  For example, “green water” use is evapotranspirational use of soil water that has been provided directly by precipitation; and “green water” has been estimated to account for 94% of global beef cattle production’s “[[water footprint]]”,&lt;ref&gt;Mekonnen, M. M. and Hoekstra, A. Y. (2010). ''The green, blue and grey water footprint of farm animals and animal products''. Vol. 2: appendices.  Value of Water Research Report Series No. 48.  UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education.&lt;/ref&gt; and on rangeland, as much as 99.5% of the water use associated with beef production is “green water”.

Impairment of water quality by manure and other substances in runoff and infiltrating water is a concern, especially where intensive livestock production is carried out.  In the US, in a comparison of 32 industries, the livestock industry was found to have a relatively good record of compliance with environmental regulations pursuant to the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act,&lt;ref&gt;US EPA. 2000. Profile of the agricultural livestock production industry. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Office of Compliance. EPA/310-R-00-002. 156 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; but pollution issues from large livestock operations can sometimes be serious where violations occur.  Various measures have been suggested by the US Environmental Protection Agency, among others, which can help reduce livestock damage to streamwater quality and riparian environments.&lt;ref&gt;US EPA. Pasture, Rangeland, and Grazing Operations – Best Management Practices (BMPs) http://www.epa.gov/agriculture/anprgbmp.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in livestock production practices influence the environmental impact of meat production, as illustrated by some beef data.  In the US beef production system, practices prevailing in 2007 are estimated to have involved 8.6% less fossil fuel use, 16% less greenhouse gas emissions (estimated as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents), 12% less withdrawn water use and 33% less land use, per unit mass of beef produced, than in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Capper | first1 = J.

Some impacts of meat-producing livestock [[Grazing#Benefits|may be considered environmentally beneficial]].

===Introductions and [[invasive species]]===
Introductions of species, particularly plants into new areas, by whatever means and for whatever reasons have brought about major and permanent changes to the environment over large areas.  Examples include the introduction of [[Caulerpa taxifolia]] into the Mediterranean, the introduction of oat species into the California grasslands, and the introduction of privet, kudzu, and [[purple loosestrife]] to North America.  Rats, cats, and goats have radically altered biodiversity in many islands.  Additionally, introductions have resulted in genetic changes to native fauna where interbreeding has taken place, as with [[American bison|buffalo]] with domestic cattle, and wolves with domestic dogs.

===Energy industry===
{{main article|Environmental impact of the energy industry}}
The environmental impact of [[energy harvesting]] and [[energy consumption|consumption]] is diverse. In recent years there has been a trend towards the increased [[renewable energy commercialization|commercialization of various renewable energy sources]].

In the real world, [[Power consumption|consumption]] of fossil fuel resources leads to [[global warming]] and climate change. However, little change is being made in many parts of the world. If the [[peak oil]] theory proves true, more explorations of viable alternative energy sources, could be more friendly to the environment.

Rapidly advancing technologies can achieve a transition of energy generation, water and waste management, and food production towards better environmental and energy usage practices using methods of [[systems ecology]] and [[industrial ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;Kay, J.

====Biodiesel====
{{main article|Environmental impact of biodiesel}}
The environmental impact of [[biodiesel]] includes energy use, greenhouse gas emissions and some other kinds of pollution.  A joint life cycle analysis by the US Department of Agriculture and the US Department of Energy found that substituting 100% biodiesel for petroleum diesel in buses reduced life cycle consumption of petroleum by 95%.  Biodiesel reduced net emissions of carbon dioxide by 78.45%, compared with petroleum diesel.  In urban buses, biodiesel reduced particulate emissions 32 percent, carbon monoxide emissions 35 percent, and emissions of sulfur oxides 8%, relative to life cycle emissions associated with use of petroleum diesel.  Life cycle emissions of hydrocarbons were 35% higher and emission of various nitrogen oxides (NOx) were 13.5% higher with biodiesel.&lt;ref&gt;USDA-USDoE.  (1998). ''Life cycle inventory of biodiesel and petroleum diesel in an urban bus''.  NREL/SR-580-24089 UC Category 1503.&lt;/ref&gt;  Life cycle analyses by the Argonne National Laboratory have indicated reduced fossil energy use and reduced greenhouse gas emissions with biodiesel, compared with petroleum diesel use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huo | first1 = H. | last2 = Wang | first2 = M. | last3 = Bloyd | first3 = C. | last4 = Putsche | first4 = V. | year = 2009 | title = Life-cycle assessment of energy use and greenhouse gas emissions of soybean-derived biodiesel and renewable fuels | url = | journal = Environ.

====Coal mining and burning====
{{main article|Environmental impact of coal mining and burning}}

The environmental impact of [[coal mining]] and -burning is diverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/coalvswind/c02c.html|title=coal power: air pollution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation passed by the US Congress in 1990 required the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to issue a plan to alleviate [[toxic]] [[air pollution]] from [[Fossil-fuel power station|coal-fired power plants]]. After delay and litigation, the EPA now has a court-imposed deadline of March 16, 2011, to issue its report.

====Electricity generation====
{{main article|Environmental impact of electricity generation}}
The environmental impact of [[electricity generation]] is significant because modern society uses large amounts of electrical power. This power is normally generated at [[power plant]]s that convert some other kind of energy into [[electricity]]. Each such system has advantages and disadvantages, but many of them pose environmental concerns.

====Nuclear power====
{{main article|Environmental impact of nuclear power}}
The environmental impact of [[nuclear power]] results from the [[nuclear fuel cycle]] processes including mining, processing, transporting and storing fuel and [[radioactive]] fuel waste. Released [[radioisotopes]] pose a health danger to human populations, animals and plants as radioactive particles enter organisms through various transmission routes.

Radiation is a [[carcinogen]] and causes numerous effects on living organisms and systems. The environmental impacts of nuclear power plant disasters such as the [[Chernobyl disaster]], the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] and the [[Three Mile Island accident]], among others, persist indefinitely, though several other factors contributed to these events including improper management of fail safe systems and natural disasters putting uncommon stress on the generators. The radioactive decay rate of particles varies greatly, dependent upon the nuclear properties of a particular isotope. Radioactive [[Plutonium-244]] has a half-life of 80.8 million years, which indicates the time duration required for half of a given sample to decay, though very little plutonium-244 is produced in the nuclear fuel cycle and lower half-life materials have lower activity thus giving off less dangerous radiation.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, G. (2012). ''Nuclear roulette: The truth about the most dangerous energy source on earth'', Chelsea Green Publishing, {{ISBN|160358434X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oil shale industry====
{{main article|Environmental impact of the oil shale industry}}
[[Image:Kivioli chemical plant.JPG|thumb|Kiviõli Oil Shale Processing &amp; Chemicals Plant in ida-Virumaa, Estonia]]
The environmental impact of the oil shale industry includes the consideration of issues such as [[land use]], [[waste management]], and [[Water pollution|water]] and [[air pollution]] caused by the [[oil shale industry|extraction and processing]] of [[oil shale]]. [[Surface mining]] of [[oil shale reserves|oil shale deposits]] causes the usual environmental impacts of [[open-pit mining]]. In addition, the [[combustion]] and [[Shale oil extraction|thermal processing]] generate waste material, which must be disposed of, and harmful atmospheric emissions, including [[carbon dioxide]], a major [[greenhouse gas]]. Experimental in-situ conversion processes and [[carbon capture and storage]] technologies may reduce some of these concerns in future, but may raise others, such as the pollution of groundwater.&lt;ref name="BartisBoston"&gt;

====Petroleum====
{{main article|Environmental impact of petroleum}}
The environmental impact of [[petroleum]] is often negative because it is [[toxic]] to almost all forms of life. Petroleum, a common word for oil or natural gas, is closely linked to virtually all aspects of present society, especially for transportation and heating for both homes and for commercial activities.

====Reservoirs====
{{main article|Environmental impact of reservoirs}}
[[Image:Wachusett-dam.jpg|thumb|right|The Wachusett Dam in [[Clinton, Massachusetts]]]]
The environmental impact of reservoirs is coming under ever increasing scrutiny as the world demand for water and energy increases and the number and size of reservoirs increases.

[[Dam]]s and the [[reservoir]]s can be used to supply [[drinking water]], generate [[hydroelectric]] power, increasing the water supply for [[irrigation]], provide recreational opportunities and flood control. However, adverse environmental and sociological impacts have also been identified during and after many reservoir constructions. Although the impact varies greatly between different dams and reservoirs, common criticisms include preventing sea-run fish from reaching their historical mating grounds, less access to water downstream, and a smaller catch for fishing communities in the area. Advances in technology have provided solutions to many negative impacts of dams but these advances are often not viewed as worth investing in if not required by law or under the threat of fines. Whether reservoir projects are ultimately beneficial or detrimental—to both the environment and surrounding human populations— has been debated since the 1960s and probably long before that. In 1960 the construction of [[Llyn Celyn]] and the flooding of [[Capel Celyn]] provoked political uproar which continues to this day. More recently, the construction of [[Three Gorges Dam]] and other similar projects throughout [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]] have generated considerable environmental and political debate.

====Wind power====
{{main article|Environmental impact of wind power}}
[[File:Wb deichh drei kuhs.jpg|thumb|right|Wind turbines in an agricultural setting]]
Compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources, the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor. [[Wind power]]ed electricity generation consumes no fuel, and emits no [[air pollution]], unlike fossil fuel power sources. The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months. While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use.&lt;ref name=mar&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf |title=Why Australia needs wind power |journal=Dissent |volume=13 |date=Summer 2004 |pages=43–48 |author=Diesendorf, Mark |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706112239/http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf |archivedate=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are conflicting reports about the effects of noise on people who live very close to a wind turbine.

===Light pollution===
{{main article|Ecological light pollution}}

[[File:Earth at Night.jpg|thumb|right|A composite image of artificial light emissions from Earth at night]]

Artificial light at night is one of the most obvious physical changes that humans have made to the biosphere, and is the easiest form of pollution to observe from space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyba|first1=Christopher|last2=Garz|first2=Stefanie|last3=Kuechly|first3=Helga|last4=de Miguel|first4=Alejandro|last5=Zamorano|first5=Jaime|last6=Fischer|first6=Jürgen|last7=Hölker|first7=Franz|title=High-Resolution Imagery of Earth at Night: New Sources, Opportunities and Challenges|journal=Remote Sensing|date=23 December 2014|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1–23|doi=10.3390/rs70100001|bibcode=2014RemS....7....1K}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main environmental impacts of artificial light are due to light's use as an information source (rather than an energy source). The hunting efficiency of visual predators generally increases under artificial light, changing [[balance of nature|predator prey interactions]]. Artificial light also affects [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]], [[Animal navigation|orientation, migration]], and [[hormone]] levels, resulting in disrupted [[circadian rhythms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hölker|first1=Franz|last2=Wolter|first2=Christian|last3=Perkin|first3=Elizabeth K.|last4=Tockner|first4=Klement|title=Light pollution as a biodiversity threat|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=December 2010|volume=25|issue=12|pages=681–682|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2010.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The environmental impact of [[cleaning agent]]s is diverse. In recent years, measures have been taken to reduce these effects.

====Nanotechnology====
{{main article|Environmental impact of nanotechnology}}
[[Nanotechnology]]'s environmental impact can be split into two aspects: the potential for nanotechnological innovations to help improve the environment, and the possibly novel type of pollution that nanotechnological materials might cause if released into the environment. As nanotechnology is an emerging field, there is great debate regarding to what extent industrial and commercial use of [[nanomaterials]] will affect organisms and ecosystems.

====Leather====
{{main article|Environmental impact of leather}}

====Paint====
{{main article|Environmental impact of paint}}
The environmental impact of paint is diverse. Traditional [[painting]] materials and processes can have harmful effects on the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], including those from the use of [[lead]] and other additives. Measures can be taken to reduce environmental impact, including accurately estimating paint quantities so that wastage is minimized, use of paints, coatings, painting accessories and techniques that are environmentally preferred. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] guidelines and [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]] ratings are some of the standards that can be applied.

====Paper====
{{main article|Environmental impact of paper}}
[[File:PulpAndPaperMill.jpg|thumb|right|A pulp and paper mill in [[New Brunswick]], Canada. Although pulp and paper manufacturing requires large amounts of energy, a portion of it comes from burning wood waste.]]
The environmental impact of paper is significant, which has led to changes in industry and behaviour at both business and personal levels. With the use of modern technology such as the [[printing press]] and the highly mechanised harvesting of wood, paper has become a cheap commodity. This has led to a high level of consumption and waste. With the rise in environmental awareness due to the lobbying by [[environmental organization]]s and with increased government regulation there is now a trend towards [[sustainability]] in the [[pulp and paper industry]].

====Pharmaceuticals and personal care products====
{{main article|Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products}}
The environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is largely speculative. PPCPs are substances used by individuals for personal health or [[cosmetics|cosmetic]] reasons and the products used by [[agribusiness]] to boost growth or health of livestock. PPCPs have been detected in water bodies throughout the world. The effects of these chemicals on humans and the environment are not yet known, but to date there is no scientific evidence that they affect human health.&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;U.S. EPA.

===Mining===
{{main article|Environmental impact of mining}}
[[File:Rio tinto river CarolStoker NASA Ames Research Center.jpg|thumb|right|Acid mine drainage in the Rio Tinto River]]
The environmental impact of mining includes [[erosion]], formation of [[sinkhole]]s, loss of [[biodiversity]], and contamination of soil, [[groundwater]] and [[surface water]] by chemicals from mining processes. In some cases, additional forest logging is done in the vicinity of mines to increase the available room for the storage of the created debris and soil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/01/gold/larmer-text/6 Logging of forests and debris dumping].

[[Image:45intoI-10 2.jpg|thumb|[[Interstate 10 (Texas)|Interstate 10]] and [[Interstate 45 (Texas)|Interstate 45]] near downtown [[Houston]], [[Texas]] in the United States]]
The environmental impact of [[transport]] is significant because it is a major user of [[energy and society|energy]], and burns most of the world's [[petroleum]]. This creates [[air pollution]], including [[nitrous oxide]]s and [[particulate]]s, and is a significant contributor to [[global warming]] through emission of [[carbon dioxide]],&lt;ref name = "pnas_pdf"/&gt; for which transport is the fastest-growing emission sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5579 |title=Analysis: Nano Hypocrisy? |author=[[Worldwatch Institute]] |date=16 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By subsector, road transport is the largest contributor to global warming.&lt;ref name="pnas_pdf"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.0702958104|title=Climate forcing from the transport sectors|year=2008|last1=Fuglestvedt|first1=J.|last2=Berntsen|first2=T.|last3=Myhre|first3=G.|last4=Rypdal|first4=K.|last5=Skeie|first5=R.

Other environmental impacts of transport systems include [[traffic congestion]] and automobile-oriented [[urban sprawl]], which can consume natural habitat and agricultural lands. By reducing transportation emissions globally, it is predicted that there will be significant positive effects on Earth's [[air quality]], [[acid rain]], [[smog]] and climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/cleanair-airpur/Transportation-WS800CCAF9-1_En.htm |title=Transportation |author=[[Environment Canada]] |accessdate=30 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713192836/http://www.ec.gc.ca/cleanair-airpur/Transportation-WS800CCAF9-1_En.htm |archivedate=July 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Holocene extinction|Defaunation|Biodiversity loss}}
{{further|Ecological collapse}}

Biodiversity generally refers to the variety and variability of life on Earth, and is represented by the number of different species there are on the planet. Since its introduction, Homo sapiens (the human species) has been killing off entire species either directly (such as through hunting) or indirectly (such as by [[habitat destruction|destroying habitats]]), causing the [[extinction]] of species at an alarming rate. Humans are the cause of the current [[mass extinction]], called the [[Holocene extinction]], driving extinctions to 100 to 1000 times the normal background rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13335683 | work=BBC News | title=Anthropocene: Have humans created a new geological age? | date=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=May, R.M. |year=1988|title=How many species are there on earth?|doi=10.1126/science.241.4872.1441|url=http://www.life.illinois.edu/ib/451/May%20(1988).pdf|journal=Science|volume=241|issue=4872|pages=1441–9|pmid=17790039|bibcode=1988Sci...241.1441M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though most experts agree that human beings have accelerated the rate of species extinction, some scholars have postulated without humans, the biodiversity of the Earth would grow at an exponential rate rather than decline.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt; The Holocene extinction continues, with [[Meat#Environmental impact|meat consumption]], [[overfishing]], [[ocean acidification]] and the [[Decline in amphibian populations|amphibian crisis]] being a few broader examples of an almost universal, [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] decline in biodiversity.

=== Global warming ===
{{Main|Global warming}}
{{Further|Runaway climate change}}

[[Global warming]] is the result of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations which is caused primarily by the combustion of fossil energy sources such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas, and to an unknown extent by destruction of forests, increased methane, volcanic activity and cement production. Such massive alteration of the global carbon cycle has only been possible because of the availability and deployment of advanced technologies, ranging in application from fossil fuel exploration, extraction, distribution, refining, and combustion in power plants and automobile engines and advanced farming practices. Livestock contributes to climate change both through the production of greenhouse gases and through destruction of [[carbon sink]]s such as rain-forests. According to the 2006 United Nations/FAO report, 18% of all greenhouse gas emissions found in the atmosphere are due to livestock. The raising of livestock and the land needed to feed them has resulted in the destruction millions of acres of Rainforest and as global demand for meat rises, so too will the demand for land. Ninety-one percent of all rainforest land deforested since 1970 is now used for livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food Choice and Sustainability|last=Oppenlander|first=Richard|publisher=Langdon Street Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-62652-435-4|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential negative environmental impacts caused by increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are rising global air temperatures, altered hydrogeological cycles resulting in more frequent and severe droughts, storms, and floods, as well as sea level rise and ecosystem disruption.&lt;ref name=IPCC&gt;[http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf IPCC, 2013: Summary for Policymakers.

Between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many wealthy [[Parsis]], began to travel to Iran from Bombay and Gujarat, to revive the Zoroastrian faith and traditions among the stagnating Zoroastrian community in Iran at the time, with prominent personalities such as civil rights activist, [[Manekji Limji Hateria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoroastrian.org.uk/vohuman/Library/Maneckji%20Limji%20Hatari%20in%20Iran.htm |title=Maneckji Limji Hatari in Iran |publisher=Zoroastrian.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Surat]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/parsi/surat3.htm|title=Parsi-Zoroastrian Settlement. Surat. Page 3|first=Ed|last=Eduljee|website=www.heritageinstitute.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  gaining local renown.

In 1920s, about 180 Indian families went to [[Zahidan]]. Following this initial influx, some of them started settling down in the nearby towns of [[Birijand]], [[Zabol]] and [[Mashhad]]. In 1950s, more Indians migrated to Iran and settled primarily in  [[Tehran]]. They consisted of [[Sikh]]s and [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]]s. In the 1960s and early 1970s, about 10,000 Indian doctors, engineers, and teachers moved to Iran as a response to the open policies initiated by the [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]], but most of them left Iran after the [[Iranian revolution]].

Now, there are few hundred people each concentrated in and around Tehran and Zahidan, primarily engaged in various small businesses. A majority are still Indian citizens. They continue to maintain strong links with India, especially in matters of children's education, marriage and property acquisition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7543">{{nihongo|'''''Kikokushijo'''''|帰国子女||lit. "repatriate children"}} and {{nihongo|'''''kaigaishijo'''''|海外子女||lit. "overseas children"}} are [[Japanese language|Japanese-language]] terms referring to the children of Japanese [[expatriate]]s who take part of their education outside [[Japan]]. The former term is used to refer to children who have returned to Japan, while the latter refers to such children while they are still overseas. They are referred to in English variously as "sojourn children" or "returnees".&lt;ref&gt;Fry 2007: 131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kanno 2000: 1&lt;/ref&gt; The term "[[third culture kids]]" has also been used, but not without reservations.&lt;ref&gt;Kano-Podolsky 2004: 76. The term ''kikokushijo'' is more well-known both in Japan and in the English literature about them. Awareness in the United States of third-culture kids and the issues they face is much lower than similar awareness of ''kikokushijo'' in Japan.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
As of 2002, roughly 10,000 children of Japanese expatriates return to Japan every year, with a total of roughly 50,000 residing overseas at any one time, a number that had remained roughly constant during the previous decade after rapid growth in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Kano-Podolsky 2004: 71, 74&lt;/ref&gt; Only 40% attend Japanese schools while living overseas.&lt;ref name="Iwabuchi 1994"&gt;Iwabuchi 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
The [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Japanese Ministry of Education]] recognised as early as 1966 that Japan's school system faced challenges in the education and re-integration of children who had returned from overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Kano-Podolsky 2004: 72&lt;/ref&gt; Under the idea of ''[[nihonjinron]]'', which stressed the alleged uniqueness of [[Japanese society]], ''kikokushijo'' began to be characterised in the 1970s as problem children who needed assistance in readjusting to Japanese society; they were thought to be too [[Westernised]] and [[individualistic]].&lt;ref name="Iwabuchi 1994"/&gt; Much of the image of ''kikokushijo'' as "educational orphans" in need of "rescue" came from the parents of such children. During the 1980s, however, ''kikokushijo'' came to be seen as a new elite rather than as problems; their language and cultural skills gained respect as valuable tools for the internationalisation of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Kano-Podolsky 2004: 73&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1997, over 300 universities offered relaxed admissions criteria for ''kikokushijo'', a system which had been attacked as preferential treatment and [[reverse discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;Kanno 2000: 4&lt;/ref&gt; They are often misperceived as fluent speakers of [[English language|English]], though many in fact resided in non-[[Anglophone countries]].&lt;ref&gt;Kano-Podolsky 2004: 74&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kikuyu''' or '''Gikuyu''' ({{lang-ki|Gĩkũyũ}} {{IPA-ki|ɣēkōjó|}}) is a language of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] family spoken primarily by the [[Kikuyu people]] (''Agĩkũyũ'') of [[Kenya]]. Numbering about 7 million (22% of Kenya's population),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ke.html#People CIA Factbook], retrieved on 16 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; they are the largest [[ethnic group]] in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/NEH/kethnic.htm|title=East Africa Living Encyclopedia|website=www.africa.upenn.edu|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kikuyu is spoken in the area between [[Nyeri]] and [[Nairobi]]. Kikuyu is one of the five languages of the Thagichu subgroup of the [[Bantu languages]], which stretches from [[Kenya]] to [[Tanzania]]. The Kikuyu people usually identify their lands by the surrounding mountain ranges in Central [[Kenya]] which they call ''Kĩrĩnyaga''.

==Dialects==
Kikuyu has four main mutually intelligible dialects. The [[Central Province (Kenya)|Central Province]] districts are divided along the traditional boundaries of these dialects, which are [[Kirinyaga District|Kîrînyaga]], [[Murang'a|Mûrang'a]], [[Nyeri]] and [[Kiambu]]. The Kikuyu from Kîrînyaga are composed of two main sub-dialects – the Ndia and Gichugu who speak the dialects ''Kĩndia'' and ''Gĩgĩcũgũ''. The Gicugus and the Ndias do not have the "ch" or "sh" sound, and will use the "s" sound instead, hence the pronunciation of "Gĩcũgũ" as opposed to "Gĩchũgũ". To hear Ndia being spoken, one needs to be in [[Kerugoya]], the largest town in Kîrînyaga. Other home towns for the Ndia, where purer forms of the dialect are spoken, are located in the tea-growing areas of [[Kagumo]], and the cool [[Kangaita]] hills. Lower down the slopes is [[Kutus]], which is a bustling dusty town with so many influences from the other dialects that it is difficult to distinguish between them.The dialect is also prevalent in the rice growing area of Mwea .

The unmistakable sing-song Gichugu dialect (which sounds like [[Meru language|Meru]] or [[Embu language|Embu]], a sister language to Kikuyu) can be heard in the coffee-growing areas of [[Kianyaga]], [[Githunguri|Gĩthũre]], [[Kathungure|Kathũngũri]], Marigiti. The [[Gichugu]] switch easily to other Kikuyu dialects in conversation with the rest of the Kikuyu.

The prenasalized consonants are often pronounced without prenasalization, and thus {{IPA|/ᵐb ⁿd ᶮdʒ ᵑɡ/}} are often realized as {{IPA|[b d dʒ ɡ]}}.

===Tones===
Kikuyu has two level tones (high and low), a low-high rising tone, and [[downstep]].&lt;ref&gt;Kevin C. Ford, 1975. "The tones of nouns in Kikuyu," ''Studies in African Linguistics'' 6, 49–64; G.N. Clements &amp; Kevin C. Ford, 1979, "Kikuyu Tone Shift and its Synchronic Consequences", ''Linguistic Inquiry'' 10.2, 179–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
The canonical word order of Gĩkũyũ is SVO ([[subject–verb–object]]). It uses [[prepositions]] rather than postpostions, and [[adjective]]s follow [[noun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_kik Wals.info]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alphabet==
Kikuyu is written in a Latin alphabet. It does not use the letters ''f  l  p  q  s  v  x  z'', and adds the letters ''ĩ'' and ''ũ''. The Kikuyu alphabet is:
:'''a  b  c  d  e  g  h  i  ĩ  j  k  m  n  o  r  t  u  ũ  w  y'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://sumale.vjf.cnrs.fr/phono/AfficheTableauOrtho2N.php?choixLangue=kikuyu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sounds are represented by digraphs such as '''ng''' for the velar nasal {{IPA|/ŋ/}}.&lt;!--this section could use more precision--&gt;

==Literature==
There is a notable literature written in the Kikuyu language. For instance, [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]]'s ''Mũrogi wa Kagogo'' (''[[Wizard of the Crow]]'') is the longest known book written in Kikuyu. Other authors writing in Kikuyu are  [[Gatua wa Mbũgwa]] and [[Waithĩra wa Mbuthia]]. Mbuthia has published various works in different genres—essays, poetry, children stories and translations—in Kikuyu. The late [[Wahome Mutahi]] also sometimes wrote in Kikuyu.

== In popular culture ==
In the 1983 [[Film|movie]] ''[[Return of the Jedi|Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi]]'', the character [[Nien Nunb]] speaks in the Kikuyu language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1983/0728/072823.html|title=In Kenya, audiences roar at language in 'Jedi' film|last=Feldmann|first=Compiled From Wire Service Dispatches With Analysis From Monitor Correspondents Around The World,Edited By Linda|date=1983-07-28|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2017-06-24|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the official language in government offices. Meitei is also spoken in the [[States and territories of India|Northeast Indian states]] of [[Assam]] and [[Tripura]], and in [[Bangladesh]] and [[Burma]] (now Myanmar). It is currently classified as a vulnerable language by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moseley|first1=C. (Editor)|title=Atlas of the world’s languages in danger (3rd ed)|date=2010|publisher=UNESCO Publishing|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meitei is a tonal language whose exact classification remains unclear. It has lexical resemblances to [[Kuki language|Kuki]] and [[Tangkhul language|Tangkhul Naga]].&lt;ref&gt;Burling, Robbins. 2003. The Tibeto-Burman Languages of Northeastern India. In Thurgood &amp; LaPolla (eds.), ''The Sino-Tibetan Languages'', 169-191. London &amp; New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been recognised (under the name ''Manipuri'') by the Indian Union and has been included in the list of [[Languages with official status in India|scheduled languages]] (included in the 8th schedule by the 71st amendment of the constitution in 1992). Meitei is taught as a subject up to the post-graduate level (Ph.D.) in some universities of India, apart from being a medium of instruction up to the undergraduate level in Manipur. Education in government schools is provided in Meitei through the eighth standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Devi |first1=S. |date=May 2013 |title=Is Manipuri an Endangered Language? |url=http://www.languageinindia.com/may2013/rebikameitheiendangeredfinal.pdf |journal=Language in India |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=520–533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Meitei'' or its alternate spelling ''Meithei'' is preferred by many native speakers of Meitei over ''Manipuri.''&lt;ref name="Chelliah 1997: 2"&gt;Chelliah (1997: 2)&lt;/ref&gt; The term is derived from the Meitei word for the language ''Meitheirón'' (''Meithei'' + ''-lon'' 'language').&lt;ref name="Chelliah 1997: 2"/&gt; ''Meithei'' may be a compound from ''mí'' 'man' + ''they'' 'separate'.&lt;ref name="Chelliah 1997: 2"/&gt; This term is used by most western linguistic scholarship.&lt;ref name="Chelliah 1997: 2"/&gt; Meitei scholars use the term ''Mei(h)tei'' when writing in English and the term ''Meitheirón'' when writing in Meitei.&lt;ref name="Chelliah 1997: 2"/&gt; Chelliah (2015: 89) notes that the ''Meitei'' spelling has replaced the earlier ''Meithei'' spelling.&lt;ref&gt;Chelliah (2015: 89)&lt;/ref&gt;

The language (and people) is also referred to by the loconym ''Manipuri.''&lt;ref name="Chelliah 1997: 2"/&gt; The term is derived from name of the state of [[Manipur]].&lt;ref name="Chelliah 1997: 2"/&gt; ''Manipur'' itself has a mythological [[folk etymology]], in which a shining diamond called ''mani'' ('jewel') in [[Sanskrit]] is thrown from the head of a snake god [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]], which spreads natural beauty throughout the land.&lt;ref name="Chelliah 1997: 2"/&gt; ''Manipuri'' is the official name of the language for the [[India]]n government and is used by government institutions and non-Meitei authors.&lt;ref name="Chelliah 1997: 2"/&gt; The term ''Manipuri'' is also used to refer to the [[Bishnupriya Manipuri language|Bishnupriya]] and people.&lt;ref name="Chelliah 1997: 2"/&gt; Additionally, ''Manipuri,'' being a loconym, can refer to anything pertaining to Manipur state.

The term ''Meetei'' is used by Meitei speakers who want political autonomy from India, so-called "revivalists".&lt;ref name="Chelliah 1997: 2"/&gt;

==Dialects==

Meitei contains various dialects; however, in more recent years the broadening of communication, as well as intermarriage, has caused the differences between these dialects to become nearly insignificant. The only exceptions to this occurrence are the speech differences of the dialects found in Tripura, Bangladesh and Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thoudam|first1=P. C.|title=Demographic and Ethnographic Information: Problems in the analysis of Manipuri language|date=2006|publisher=Central Institute of Indian Language}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact number of dialects of Meitei is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haokip |first1=P. |date=April 2011 |title=The Languages of Manipur: A Case Study of the Kuki-Chin Languages |journal=Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=86–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three main dialects of Meitei include: Meitei proper, Loi and the Pangal. Differences found within Meitei's dialects are primarily characterised by the extensions of new sounds and tonal shifts. Meitei proper is considered, of the three, to be the standard dialect—and is considered to be more dynamic{{Clarify|date=November 2014}} than the other two dialects.{{Clarify|date=July 2015}} Slight variations in dialects can be seen in the following table:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ningoma|first1=M.

==Phonology==

=== Tone ===

The Meitei language is a [[tonal language]]. There is a controversy over whether there are two or three tones.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=LaPolla |first1=Randy J. |author-link=Randy LaPolla |date=2000 |title=Book review: A grammar of Meitei, by S.

=== Segments ===

Meitei makes use of the following sounds:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chelliah|first1=S. L.|title=Meitei Phonology|date=1997|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|pages=17–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: the central vowel /ɐ/ is transcribed as &lt;ə&gt; in recent linguistic work on Meitei. However, phonetically it is never [ə], but more usually [ɐ]. It is assimilated to a following approximant: /ɐw/ = /ow/, /ɐj/ = [ej].

===Phonological processes===

==== Velar deletion ====

A velar deletion is noted to occur on the suffix -lək when following a syllable ending with a /k/ phoneme.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==== Grassman's Law ====

Meitei has a [[dissimilatory]] process similar to [[Grassmann's Law]] found in Ancient Greek and Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;Chelliah (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Here, an aspirated consonant is deaspirated if preceded by an aspirated consonant (including {{IPA|/h/, /s/}}) in the previous syllable. The deaspirated consonants are then voiced between sonorants.

* {{IPA|/tʰin-/}} ('pierce') + {{IPA|/-khət/}} ('upward') → {{IPA|/tʰinɡət/}} ('pierce upwards')
* {{IPA|/səŋ/}} ('cow') + {{IPA|/kʰom/}} ('udder') → {{IPA|/səŋɡom/}} ('milk')
* {{IPA|/hi-/}} ('trim') + {{IPA|/-tʰok/}} ('outward') → {{IPA|/hidok/}} ('trim outwards')

==Writing systems==

===Meitei script===
{{main|Meitei script}}
Meitei has [[Meitei script|its own script]], which was used until the 18th century. Its earliest use is not known. [[Pamheiba]], the ruler of the [[Manipur Kingdom]] who introduced [[Hinduism]], banned the use of the Meitei script and adopted the [[Bengali script]]. Now in schools and colleges the Bengali script is gradually being replaced by the Meitei script. The local organisations have played a major role in spreading the awareness about its own script.

Many Meitei documents were destroyed at the beginning of the 18th century during the reign of Hindu converted King Pamheiba, under the instigation of the Bengali Hindu missionary, [[Shantidas Gosai]].

Between 1709 and the middle of the 20th century, the Meitei language was written using the Bengali script. During the 1940s and 1950s, Meitei scholars began campaigning to bring back the Old Meitei (Old Manipuri) alphabet. In 1976 at a writers conference, all the scholars finally agreed on a new version of the alphabet containing a number of additional letters to represent sounds not present in Meitei when the script was first developed. The current Meitei alphabet is a reconstruction of the ancient Meitei script.

Since the early 1980s, the Meitei alphabet has been taught in schools in Manipur.

It is a syllabic alphabet in which consonants all have an inherent vowel /a/. Other vowels are written as independent letters or by using diacritical marks that are written above, below, before or after the consonant they belong to. Each letter is named after a part of the human body.

There are some texts from the [[Maring Naga|Maring]] and [[Limbu people|Limbu]] tribes of Manipur, which were written in the Meitei script.

===Latin script===
There exists an informal, but fairly consistent practical spelling of Meitei in Latin script. This spelling is used in the transcription of personal names and place names, and it is extensively used on the internet (Facebook, blogspots, etc.). It is also found in academic publications, for the spelling of Meitei book titles and the like (examples can be seen in the References, below). This spelling on the whole offers a transparent, unambiguous representation of the Meitei sound system, although the tones are usually not marked. It is "practical" in the sense that it does not use extra-alphabetical symbols, and can therefore be produced easily on any standard keyboard. The only point of ambiguity is found in the spelling of the vowels /ɐ/ and /a/, which are usually both written "a", except when they occur before an [[approximant]] (see table below). The vowel /a/ is sometimes written as "aa" to distinguish it from /ɐ/.

==Grammar==
{{Empty section|date=October 2014}}

=== Number agreement ===
Agreement in nouns and pronouns is expressed to clarify singular and plural cases through the addition of the suffixes -khoi (for personal pronouns and human proper nouns) and -sing (for all other nouns). Verbs associated with the pluralised nouns are unaffected. Examples are demonstrated below:&lt;ref name="Singh 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Singh |first=S. Indrakumar |date=November 2013 |title=Agreements in Manipuri |url=http://www.languageinindia.com/nov2013/indrakumaragreementsmanipurifinal.pdf |journal=Language in India |volume=13 |issue=11 |pages=216–231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Noun (Meitei) !! Noun (English) !! Example (Meitei) !! Example (English)
|-
| angaang || baby || angaang kappi|| Baby cries.
|-
| angaangsing || babies || angaangsing kappi || Babies cry.
|}

When adjectives are used to be more clear, Meitei utilises separate words and does not add a suffix to the noun. Examples are show in the chart below:&lt;ref name="Singh 2013" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Adjective (Meitei) !! Adjective (English) !! Example (Meitei) !! Example (English)
|-
| ama || one || mi ama laak’i || A person comes.
|-
| khara || some || mi khara laak’i || Some persons come.
|-
| mayaam || many || mi mayaam laak’i || Many persons come.
|}

=== Compound verbs ===
Compound verbs are created by combining root verbs each ending with aspect markers. While the variety of suffixes is high, all compound verbs utilise one of two:&lt;ref name="Devi 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Devi |first1=M. Bidyarani |date=May 2014 |title=Compound Verbs in Manipuri |url=http://www.languageinindia.com/may2014/bidyaranimanipuricompoundverbsfinal.pdf |journal=Language in India |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=66–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Suffix !! English translation
|-
| -thok|| out/ come out
|-
| -ning|| To wish/ want/ desire
|}

Aspect markers appear as suffixes that clarify verb tense and appear at the end of the compound verb. Overall, the formula to construct a compound verb becomes [root verb] + [suffix] + [aspect marker]:&lt;ref name="Devi 2014" /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Language !! Root verb !! Suffix !! Aspect marker !! Combined form
|-
| Meitei || tum || -thok || -le || tumthokle
|-
| English || sleep || out/ come out || perfect aspect || has started sleeping
|-
| Meitei || tum || -ning || -le || tumningle
|-
| English || sleep || want || perfect aspect || has felt sleepy
|}

Compound verbs can also be formed utilising both compound suffixes as well, allowing utterances such as ''pithokningle'' meaning "want to give out".

==Linguistic tradition==
The culture involved with the Meetei language is rooted deeply with pride and tradition based on having respect to the community elders. Young children who do not know about the tales that have been passed on from generation to generation are very rare. Regarding the history behind the ancient use of [[proverb]]s that defines the way conversation is held with the Meetei language, it is a way of expressing and telling stories and even using modern slang with old proverbs to communicate between one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Betholia |first1=C. |date=August 2008 |title=Manipuri Culture Seen Through Proverbs |url=http://indianfolklore.org/journals/index.php/IFL/article/view/111/883 |journal=Indian Folklife |issue=30 |pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singh has analyzed features of Meitei proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Lourembam Surjit. 2015. Morphosemantic Attributes of Meetei Proverbs. ''Advances in Language and Literary Studies'' 6.3 [http://www.journals.aiac.org.au/index.php/alls/article/view/1520/1461 Web access]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Meitei language is known to be one of the oldest languages in [[Northeast India|northeastern India]] and has a lengthy 2000-year period of existence. It had its own script. The history behind the Meitei language itself comes primarily from the medieval period of northeastern India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Singh |first1=T. D. |date=April 2014 |title=Phonological System of Medieval Manipuri |url=http://www.languageinindia.com/april2014/debachandmedievalmanipuri.pdf |journal=Language in India |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=56–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Buffer''' (born November 2, 1944) is an American [[ring announcer]] for [[boxing]] and [[professional wrestling]] matches. He is known for his [[trademark]]ed catchphrase, "Let's get ready to rumble!" and for pioneering a distinct announcing style in which he rolls certain letters and adds other inflections to a fighter's name. His half-brother is UFC announcer [[Bruce Buffer]].

==Early life==
Buffer was born and raised in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], to an enlisted man in the [[United States Navy]] and his wife during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="boxing-monthly.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxing-monthly.co.uk/content/9812/two.htm |title=Article Two – December 1998 |publisher=Boxing Monthly |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930184027/http://www.boxing-monthly.co.uk/content/9812/two.htm |archivedate=September 30, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents divorced when he was 11 months of age, and Buffer was then raised by foster parents, a school bus driver and housewife, in the Philadelphia suburb of [[Roslyn, Pennsylvania|Roslyn]].&lt;ref name="Brien1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Brien |first=Richard|title=Let's Get Ready to… |journal=Sports Illustrated|volume=76 |date=June 1992|pages=72–78.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enlisted in the [[United States Army]] during the [[Vietnam War]] at age 20 and served until age 23. He held various jobs including a car salesman, then began a modeling career at age 32 before becoming a ring announcer at age 38.&lt;ref name="boxing-monthly.co.uk"/&gt;

==Career==

===Boxing===
In 1982, Buffer began his career as a [[ring announcer]]. By 1983, he was announcing all boxing matches promoted by [[Bob Arum]]'s Top Rank on [[ESPN]], which gave him a national identity at a time when ring announcers were strictly locally hired talent.&lt;ref name="Boxing – Columns – Thomas Hauser"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://secondsout.com/USA/colhauser.cfm?ccs=208&amp;cs=13614 |title=Boxing - Columns - Thomas Hauser |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018100725/http://www.secondsout.com/usa/colhauser.cfm?ccs=208&amp;cs=13614 |archivedate=October 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1984, Buffer developed the [[catchphrase]] "Let's get ready to rumble" in his announcing, which gained enormous popularity. He began the process of obtaining a federal trademark for the phrase in the 1980s, acquiring it in 1992. Consequently, Buffer has earned in excess of $400 million with the license for his trademark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Reilly|first1=Terry|title=The Crazy World of Trademarks|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence/the-crazy-world-of-trademarks-1.3918789|accessdate=7 January 2017|work=Under the Influence|agency=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|publisher=[[CBC Radio]]|date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1980s, Buffer was the exclusive ring announcer for all bouts in [[Donald Trump]]-owned casinos. Trump said of Buffer, "He's great, he's the choice, he has a unique ability...I told my people, 'We got to have him.'" &lt;ref name="Brien1992" /&gt; Buffer's work was also admired by many boxing greats. [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] once said, "When [Buffer] introduces a fighter, it makes him want to fight." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalspeakers.com/speakers/ISBB-553JXN/Michael_Buffer |title=Michael Buffer – iSB Keynote Speakers and Entertainment |publisher=Internationalspeakers.com |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114065339/http://www.internationalspeakers.com/speakers/ISBB-553JXN/Michael_Buffer/ |archivedate=January 14, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Buffer signed with [[DAZN]] to serve as ring announcer for all of its boxing broadcasts, which include deals with [[Matchroom Boxing|Matchroom]] and [[Canelo Álvarez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2018/11/16/Marketing-and-Sponsorship/DAZN-Ad.aspx|title=Canelo Alvarez, Michael Buffer Take Shots At Pay-Per-View In DAZN Ad|website=Sports Business Daily|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/sugar-ray-leonard-brian-kenny-ringside-team-dazn-boxing-1202943855/|title=‘Sugar’ Ray Leonard, Brian Kenny Among Ringside Team for DAZN Boxing|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|date=2018-09-17|work=Variety|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wrestling===
Buffer was formerly the exclusive ring announcer for [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) main events featuring [[Hulk Hogan]] or other top WCW talent until 2001, when the organization folded.&lt;ref name="Michael Buffer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/name/nm0119354 |title=Michael Buffer |publisher=[[IMDb]] |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; WCW's former parent company [[Time Warner]] owned through their [[pay-per-view]] subscription division [[HBO]], which broadcast many matches from promoter Top Rank, of which Buffer is the lead ring announcer. The exclusivity of his contract with WCW prevented Buffer from announcing for other wrestling-type organizations, forcing him to stop announcing for the UFC (his only UFC cards were UFC 6 and UFC 7). However, when WCW ceased to exist, and Time Warner had no more affiliation with professional wrestling, Buffer was enabled to announce in other wrestling promotions. During the [[Monday Night Wars]], while Buffer was on ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'', [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWF]] wrestler [[Triple H]] created the phrase "Let's get ready to suck it!" to mock him, as part of his [[D-Generation X]] act.

On the [[Saturday Night's Main Event results#Saturday Night's Main Event XXXV|August 18, 2007 edition]] of [[Saturday Night's Main Event]], for the first time in more than six years, Buffer returned to pro-wrestling ring announcing duties at [[Madison Square Garden]] in a boxing match between pro boxer [[Evander Holyfield]] (who was substituting for [[Montel Vontavious Porter]]) and pro wrestler [[Matt Hardy]]. Buffer appears in the [[Royal Rumble (2008)|Royal Rumble 2008]] commercial, in which he begins to say "Let's get ready to rumble!" only to be [[superkick]]ed by [[Shawn Michaels]], causing him to fall over. As well as being in the commercial for the event, he was the guest ring announcer during the [[Royal Rumble#Match|Royal Rumble match]] itself.

===Other sports===

During his career, Buffer has announced the [[World Series]], [[Stanley Cup]] Final, [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] Finals, the [[Bass Pro Shops NRA Night Race|Volunteer 500]] at [[Bristol Motor Speedway]], and [[National Football League|NFL]] playoff games. He was a guest announcer at the [[1999 Indianapolis 500]] and the [[2017 United States Grand Prix]].

Buffer, like his brother Bruce, announced early UFC fights, starting at [[UFC 6]] in 1995. He was the host of [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]]' boxing retro show ''Legends of the Ring'', produced by Top Rank, Inc., where he was ring announcer for most of their top matches.

On July 19, 2008, he announced the [[Affliction: Banned]] mixed martial arts show. On November 10, 2008, Buffer started the heads-up action between the two remaining players, [[Peter Eastgate]] and [[Ivan Demidov]] at the [[2008 World Series of Poker]] final table with a modified version of his trademark statement, "Let's get ready to shuffle up and deal".

Buffer appeared at the University of Kentucky's men's basketball teams' legendary "Big Blue Madness" on October 14, 2016. Instead of his traditional "Let's get ready to rumble!" Buffer announced the beginning of the event with "Let's get ready to roundball!".

He kept up this tradition on Saturday, January 28 when he announced his new rendition again at the perennial Blue Blood rivalry between the men's basketball teams of the University of Kentucky and the University of Kansas.

===Other appearances===
Buffer has appeared on various talk shows hosted by [[Jay Leno]], [[David Letterman]], [[Arsenio Hall]], [[Conan O'Brien]] and [[Jimmy Kimmel]].  He has also appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[In Living Color]]'', ''[[Mad TV]]'' and ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marksfriggin.com/news01/4-23-01.htm|title=Stern Show News|publisher=MarksFriggin.com |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Deal or No Deal]]'' on December 10, 2007, and opened the finale of the [[American Idol (season 7)|seventh season]] of ''[[American Idol]]'', a production of RTL. In 2011 he made an appearance on the 12th season of [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]] to announce [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] week 3 dance. Buffer has also served as ringside announcer for the syndicated television game show ''[[The Grudge Match]]'', hosted by Steve Albert and Jesse Ventura.

He has played himself in various films including ''[[Ready to Rumble]]'' and ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'', and in 2008 Buffer appeared as Walbridge, the main villain in the comedy ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]''.&lt;ref name="Michael Buffer"/&gt;

Buffer has been animated in ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', and ''[[Celebrity Deathmatch]]''. Buffer also appears in the [[animated]] [[TV series]] ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' in the episode "[[Raging Bully]]", as the voice of the announcer for the big thumb-wrestling match with Phineas and Buford. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Buffer appeared in the extended version of [[the Muppets]] webisode "Food Fight", where he is seen announcing the cooking competition between [[Gordon Ramsay]] and the [[Swedish Chef]].

Buffer appears as featuring artist on "Let's Get Ready to Rumble" and "Go for It All!" by [[Germany|German]] [[eurodance]] group the K.O.'s and his voice was sampled in the [[PJ &amp; Duncan|Ant &amp; Dec]] song "[[Let's Get Ready to Rhumble]]". {{citation needed|date=March 2014}} He recorded the introduction track for country artist [[Josh Turner]]'s 2012 album, ''[[Punching Bag (album)|Punching Bag]]''.

In 2013, Buffer appeared in Progressive Insurance commercials, promoting their program of combining different coverages into one policy, with a parody of his famous phrase - "Let's get ready to bundle!" {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

He was also the announcer for the YouTube Boxing match between [[KSI vs Logan Paul]] on August 25, 2018.

Buffer  reproduced as an action figure in both Toy Biz's WCW line and Jakks Pacific's Rocky line.

===Trademark===
Buffer began using the phrase "Let's get ready to rumble!" in 1984.  By 1992, he acquired a federal trademark for the phrase.  Buffer uses his famous phrase in various licensing deals including the platinum selling album ''[[Jock Jams]]'' by [[Tommy Boy Records]], the video games ''[[Ready 2 Rumble Boxing]]'', ''[[Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Nintendo 64]], [[Dreamcast]] and [[Game Boy Advance]] and ''[[Greatest Heavyweights of the Ring]]'' for the [[Sega Genesis]] and numerous other products. In addition, he has used variations of the phrase in advertisements, including the popular commercial for [[Mega Millions]] in which he says "Let's get ready to Win Big!" and the [[Kraft Cheese]] commercial in which he says "Let's get ready to Crumble!" and most recently for [[Progressive Insurance]] in which he says "Let's get ready to bundle!"
The  phrase, "Are you ready to rumble?" is spoken in the 1957 television show ''Maverick'', titled "Stage West" (episode 6, season one).
by the stage coach driver to the passengers as he prepares to leave in the stage coach. 
As of 2009, the catchphrase has generated $400 million in revenue from licensing the trademark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Weekend/lets-ready-rumble-meet-man-catchphrase/story?id=9022704 | title = 'Let's Get Ready to Rumble' Worth $400M | author = John Berman and Michael Milberger | publisher = [[ABC News]] | date = November 9, 2009 | accessdate =November 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Buffer's fame has reunited him with long-lost family members. In 1989, Buffer was contacted by his birth-father, who introduced Buffer to his half-brothers after seeing him on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3icd64063a76e6b87b4c0d5e79d8d5281c | title=Hollywood Reporter}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1990s, Buffer brought along one of his half-brothers, [[Bruce Buffer]], as his agent/manager. This grew into a business partnership to increase licensing productivity of the trademark.

Buffer first wed at age 21 but the marriage ended in divorce after seven years. He has two sons from his first marriage. More than 25 years passed before he remarried in 1999. He and his second wife divorced in 2003.&lt;ref name="Boxing – Columns – Thomas Hauser"/&gt;

On September 13, 2007, while making an appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', he proposed to his current (third) wife, Christine. Buffer currently resides in Southern California. His half-brother [[Bruce Buffer]] is the announcer for leading [[mixed martial arts]] promotion, [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]].

In 2008 Buffer was treated for [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boxinginsider.com/headlines/michael-buffer-battles-cancer/ | title=Michael Buffer Battles Cancer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32332">[[Witch-hunt]]s are today practiced in [[Modern history|modern times]] throughout the world. While prevalent in all continents, hot-spots of current witch-hunting are [[India]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Amazonas Region]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. While an unknown problem in vast parts of the Western population, body-counts of '''modern witch-hunts''' by far exceed those of early-modern witch-hunting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Behringer, Wolfgang 2004: Witches and Witch-hunts. A global History. Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

Of main terminological interest in ethnographic literature were the emic perspectives and differentiations between witchcraft (spiritual) and sorcery (possible empiric actions like creating amuletts, charms, chanting spells and curses) and the classification and translation of native terminology concerning spiritual offenses and powers. Ethnographic literature has used the term "sorcerer-hunt", which is used equivalent to witch-hunt. Also "sorcery" and "sorcellerie" is sometimes used as equivalent to "witchcraft".  A confusion of the terms "witch-hunt", "witchcraft" and "witchcraft notions" permeates scientific literature.

In this article, only those cases are referred to as witch-hunts, that involve the notion of a spiritual crime. Closely related and sometimes included are accusations of sorcery, where a potentially observable act is suggested, but rarely proven.
Acts of lynching involving fabricated rumors of ritual murders occur frequently in Sub-Saharan Africa. They can be classified as very closely related to witch-hunts.

Not included is the different phenomenon [[ritual murder]] or any [[ritual abuse]], which is sometimes referred to as witchcraft or witch-hunting (meaning the man-hunt for body-parts for ritual purposes).

A common parlance refers to witch-hunts as "[[witchcraft]]", a confusion of topics. Another common parlance refers to political persecution in general as "witch-hunt", an example were the trials of [[McCarthyism]] in the USA.

== Africa ==

Most witch-hunts today take place in modern sub-Saharan [[Africa]]. The majority of ethnographic literature on the subject remains on a local level. Summarizing studies and meta-analysis remain scarce due to the amount of data involved. Max Marwick, John Middleton, Mary Douglas&lt;ref&gt;

A particularly high prevalence of recent witch-hunting has been noted for the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]], [[South Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other states showing ongoing and repeated witch-hunts are [[Malawi]], [[Ghana]], [[Gambia]], [[Benin]], [[Angola]], [[Central African Republic|CAR]]. While some societies suffer at most sporadic and low-level witch-hunts ([[Senegal]], [[Namibia]], [[Rwanda]]), the entire Sub-Saharan Africa shows a high prevalence of beliefs in the existence of witchcraft and a considerable prevalence of violent witch-hunts. Nonetheless, many if not most ethnic groups belief in the existence of witchcraft but do not or not normally accuse people of witchcraft. Where accusations occur, accusations do not in all places lead to violence and can be even used for benefits by the accused person.

=== Cameroon ===
Several African states, including [[Cameroon]], have reestablished witchcraft-accusations in courts after their independence.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Gambia ===
In March 2009, Amnesty International reported that up to 1,000 people in the [[Gambia]] had been abducted by government-sponsored "witch doctors" on charges of witchcraft, and taken to detention centers where they were forced to drink poisonous concoctions. On 21 May 2009, The New York Times reported that the alleged witch-hunting campaign had been sparked by the Gambian President, Yahya Jammeh.

=== Ghana ===
Research on witch-hunting in [[Ghana]] dates back into the early 20th century. Arthur W. Cardinall may be the first anthropologist to mention the Ghetto for victims of witch-hunts at an [[earth-shrine]] in Gnani (Tindang, Gnaani).&lt;ref name=Reidel2014&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the documentary ''Witches in Exile'' by Allison Berg followed the structure of accusations in Kukuo, the biggest Ghetto near Bimbilla. Another documentary, ''The Witches of Gambaga'', follows over 10 years the inmates of Gambaga.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Bradt Travel Guides]]'' mentions the ghetto in Gambaga as a tourist attraction. 
A total of eight sanctuaries for witch-hunt victims were listed by the Ethnologist Felix Riedel. The list of sanctuaries includes so far (locations with inmates):&lt;ref name=Reidel2014/&gt;
* Kukuo (Bimbilla, Nanumba South):  450.
* Tindang (Gnani, Gnaani):          350.
* Gushiegu:                         120.
* Gambaga:                           80.
* Nabule (Chereponi):                55.
* Kpatinga:                          40.
* Duabone:                           10.
* Banyasi (Bonyanse):                3-8.

While all are sanctuaries that offer protection for outcasts, at least five of the eight ghettoes are dominated by an earth-priest. They then serve as sites for traditional exorcisms, that involve a chicken-ordeal to determine the guilt or innocence of an accused person and a concoction to cleanse the supposed witchcraft-power. The local earth is believed to neutralize the witchcraft powers.&lt;ref name=Reidel2014/&gt;  
 
Ethnographic research and journalistic interest in the comparably safe and well-researched Northern Ghana sometimes lead to an overrepresentation of Ghana what witch-hunting concerns. Neighbouring regions and countries appear underrepresented in current research in comparison.

In the southern parts of Ghana as in its urban areas witch-hunting as mass-violence occurs, but far less frequent than in the Northern Regions. Deadly mass-panics in Accra and Kumasi involved media-induced penis-theft-hysterias common throughout Western and Central Africa. In general, witchcraft accusations in Southern Ghana today tend to stay rather peaceful or at least quiet, leading to social isolation of a person. A study of Van der Geest also showed, that almost every person in a Southern Ghanaian town has both experienced an accusation and accused another person.&lt;ref&gt;Bleek, Wolf (Sjaak van der Geest) 1976: Witchcraft, Gossip and Death: A social Drama. In: Man 11/4. Hg. von Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland. 526-541.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, several Witch-hunting movements spread from Northern Ghana's shrine Tongnaab into Southern Ghana and into Nigeria. Those movements tended to stay rather peaceful, while harassment, beating and fining of accused persons occurred on a regular base.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Kenya ===
[[Kenya]] has a long-covered history of witch-hunts. In the past years, lynchings were a frequent feature of public violence. 
For example, it was reported on 21 May 2008 that in Kenya a mob had burnt to death at least 11 people accused of witchcraft.

=== Sierra Leone ===
In [[Sierra Leone]], the witch-hunt is an occasion for a sermon by the kɛmamɔi (native Mende witch-finder) on social ethics : "Witchcraft ... takes hold in people's lives when people are less than fully open-hearted. All wickedness is ultimately because people hate each other or are jealous or suspicious or afraid. These emotions and motivations cause people to act antisocially".{{cite quote|date=July 2014}} The response by the populace to the kɛmamɔi is that "they valued his work and would learn the lessons he came to teach them, about social responsibility and cooperation."{{cite quote|date=July 2014}}

=== Tanzania ===
[[Tanzania]] has seen some of the most intense witch-hunts throughout Africa with an estimated 20,000 people brought to death throughout the past 20 years. Mostly elderly women were affected by the violence. As a main factor, economic strains and exploitation are named by documentaries, state-reports and independent observers.

=== Zambia ===
[[Audrey I. Richards]], in the journal ''Africa'', relates in 1935 an instance when a new wave of witchfinders, the ''Bamucapi'', appeared in the villages of the [[Bemba people]] of [[Zambia]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
  |title=A Modern Movement of Witch Finders

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They dressed in European clothing, and would summon the headman to prepare a ritual meal for the village. When the villagers arrived they would view them all in a [[mirror]], and claimed they could identify witches with this method. These accused persons would then have to "yield up his horns"; i.e. give over the [[horn (anatomy)|horn]] containers for [[curse]]s and evil [[potion]]s to the witch-finders. The bamucapi then made all drink a potion called ''kucapa'' which would cause a witch to die and swell up if he ever tried such things again.

The villagers related that the witch-finders were always right because the witches they found were always the people whom the village had feared all along. The bamucapi utilised a mixture of Christian and native religious traditions to account for their powers and said that God (not specifying which God) helped them to prepare their medicine. In addition, all witches who did not attend the meal to be identified would be called to account later on by their master, who had risen from the dead, and who would force the witches by means of drums to go to the graveyard, where they would die. Richards noted that the bamucapi created the sense of danger in the villages by rounding up ''all'' the horns in the village, whether they were used for anti-witchcraft charms, potions, snuff or were indeed receptacles of black magic.

== Other regions ==

=== India ===
Some people in [[India]], mostly in villages, have the belief that [[witchcraft]] and [[black magic]] are effective. On one hand, people may seek advice from witch doctors for health, financial or marital problems.&lt;ref name=blackmagic&gt;{{cite news|title=Black Magic practices in India|url=http://www.dw.de/black-magic-practices-in-india/a-15969540|accessdate=13 September 2013|newspaper=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, people, especially women, are accused of witchcraft and attacked, occasionally killed.&lt;ref name=witchbeaten&gt;{{cite news|title=Village 'witches' beaten in India|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8315980.stm?ls|accessdate=13 September 2013|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=20 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=witchfamilies&gt;{{cite news|title='Witch' family killed in India|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7449825.stm|accessdate=13 September 2013|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=12 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that mostly widows or divorcees are targeted to rob them of their property.&lt;ref name="widow witch"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bengal tribesmen kill 'witches'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2166856.stm|accessdate=13 September 2013|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=27 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, revered village witch-doctors are paid to brand specific persons as witches, so that they can be killed without repercussions.

In India, labeling a woman as a witch is a common ploy to grab land, settle scores or even to punish her for turning down sexual advances. In a majority of the cases, it is difficult for the accused woman to reach out for help and she is forced to either abandon her home and family or driven to commit suicide. Most cases are not documented because it is difficult for poor and illiterate women to travel from isolated regions to file police reports. Less than 2 percent of those accused of witch-hunting are actually convicted, according to a study by the Free Legal Aid Committee, a group that works with victims in the state of Jharkhand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womensenews.org/story/the-world/070716/recourse-rare-witch-hunt-victims-in-india Womensnews.org].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Frederick George 1994: The Witch-Hunt, or the Triumph of Morality.

=== Nepal ===
Witch hunts in Nepal are common, and are targeted especially against low-caste women.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/7241937/Witch-hunts-of-low-caste-women-in-Nepal.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whrin.org"&gt;http://www.whrin.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Witchcraft-report-INSEC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The main causes of witchcraft related violence include widespread belief in superstition, lack of education, lack of public awareness, illiteracy, caste system, male domination, and economic dependency of women on men. The victims of this form of violence are often beaten, tortured, publicly humiliated, and murdered. Sometimes, the family members of the accused are also assaulted.&lt;ref name="whrin.org"/&gt;
In 2010, Sarwa Dev Prasad Ojha, minister for women and social welfare, said, "Superstitions are deeply rooted in our society, and the belief in witchcraft is one of the worst forms of this." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-02-07/witch-hunt-victim-recounts-torture-ordeal/2580662&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Papua New Guinea ===
Though the practice of "white" magic (such as [[faith healing]]) is legal in [[Papua New Guinea]], the 1976 Sorcery Act imposes a penalty of up to 2 years in prison for the practice of [[black magic|"black" magic]]. In 2009, the government reports that extrajudicial torture and murder of alleged witches – usually lone women – are spreading from the highland areas to cities as villagers migrate to urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/programmes/unreported-world/episode-guide/series-2009/episode-9 Channel4.com].&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in June 2013, four women were accused of witchcraft because the family "had a 'permanent house' made of wood, and the family had tertiary educations and high social standing".&lt;ref name="2013 witch burning in New Guinea"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.yahoo.com/witch-hunts-papua-guinea-linked-jealousy-054301668.html | title=Witch hunts in Papua New Guinea linked to jealousy | agency=Associated Press | date=10 June 2013 | accessdate=10 June 2013 | author=McGuirk, Rod}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the women were tortured and Helen Rumbali was beheaded.&lt;ref name="2013 witch burning in New Guinea"/&gt; Helen Hakena, chairwoman of the North Bougainville Human Rights Committee, said that the accusations started because of economic jealousy born of a mining boom.&lt;ref name="2013 witch burning in New Guinea"/&gt;

=== Saudi Arabia ===
Witchcraft or sorcery remains a criminal offense in Saudi Arabia, although the precise nature of the crime is undefined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Precarious Justice – Arbitrary Detention and Unfair Trials in the Deficient Criminal Justice System of Saudi Arabia |publisher=Human Rights Watch |year=2008 |page=143 |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/node/62304/section/23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frequency of prosecutions for this in the country as whole is unknown. However, in November 2009, it was reported that 118 persons had been arrested in the province of Makkah that year for practising magic and "using the Book of Allah in a derogatory manner", 74% of them being female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Distance witch finally caught; 118 detained this year |url=http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2009110453524&amp;archiveissuedate=04/11/2009 |newspaper=Saudi Gazette |date=4 November 2009 |accessdate=6 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110161629/http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2009110453524&amp;archiveissuedate=04%2F11%2F2009 |archivedate=10 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Human Rights Watch]] in 2009, prosecutions for witchcraft and sorcery are proliferating and "Saudi courts are sanctioning a literal witch hunt by the religious police."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Saudi Arabia: Witchcraft and Sorcery Cases on the Rise |date=24 November 2009 |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/11/24/saudi-arabia-witchcraft-and-sorcery-cases-rise |accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, an illiterate Saudi woman, [[Fawza Falih]], was convicted of practising witchcraft, including casting an impotence spell, and sentenced to death by beheading, after allegedly being beaten and forced to fingerprint a false confession that had not been read to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=King Abdullah urged to spare Saudi 'witchcraft' woman's life |newspaper=The Times |date=16 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After an appeal court had cast doubt on the validity of the death sentence because the confession had been retracted, the lower court reaffirmed the same sentence on a different basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Letter to HRH King Abdullah bin Abd al-'Aziz Al Saud on "Witchcraft" Case |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=12 February 2008 |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/02/12/letter-hrh-king-abdullah-bin-abd-al-aziz-al-saud-witchcraft-case |accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2007, Abdul Hamid Bin Hussain Bin Moustafa al-Fakki, a Sudanese national, was sentenced to death after being convicted of producing a spell that would lead to the reconciliation of a divorced couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sudanese man facing execution in Saudi Arabia over 'sorcery' charges |url=http://www.afrik-news.com/article17642.html |newspaper=Afrik News |date=15 May 2010 |accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Ali Hussain Sibat|Ali Sibat]], a Lebanese television presenter who had been arrested whilst on a pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, was sentenced to death for witchcraft arising out of his fortune-telling on an Arab satellite channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lebanese TV host Ali Hussain Sibat faces execution in Saudi Arabia for sorcery |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article7085303.ece |newspaper=The Times |date=2 April 2010 |accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His appeal was accepted by one court, but a second in Medina upheld his death sentence again in March 2010, stating that he deserved it as he had publicly practised sorcery in front of millions of viewers for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Lebanese PM should step in to halt Saudi Arabia 'Sorcery' execution |publisher=Amnesty International |date=1 April 2010 |url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=18702 |accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010, the Supreme Court refused to ratify the death sentence, stating that there was insufficient evidence that his actions had harmed others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Saudi court rejects death sentence for TV psychic |url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/TopStories/20101113/saudi-psychic-sentenced-101113/ |publisher=CTV News |agency=Associated Press |date=13 November 2010 |accessdate=6 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120092804/http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/TopStories/20101113/saudi-psychic-sentenced-101113/ |archivedate=20 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amazonia ===
Neil L. Whitehead and Robin Wright presented a collection of essays on witch-hunts among native tribes in the amazon high- and lowlands. While prevalent in many tribes, especially child-witch-hunts among [[Ashaninka]] have attracted interest and raised questions about methodological strategies in reporting abusive practices in an already biased environment.

== Children and witch-hunting ==

Witch-hunts against children appear in the early ethnographic literature. In Cameroon, DRC, Ghana, but also in Brazil sporadic child-witch-hunts have a tradition of at least 100 years. In the past 20 years and especially in the past 10 years an unprecedented increase in child-witch-hunting has been noted in Southern Nigeria, DRC, Angola, Ghana and other sub-Saharan regions. Several sources estimate 40,000 children in Kinshasa alone as witch-hunt-related orphans. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whrin.org/felix-riedel-children-in-african-witch-hunts-an-introduction-for-scientists-and-social-workers/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public awareness and scientific debate ==
Public awareness of witch-hunting outside Africa is low compared to other conflicts. In early social/[[cultural anthropology]], [[ethnology]] and other cultural sciences, witchcraft beliefs and witch-hunts ranked as paradigmatic problems especially from the late 19th century into the first half of the 20th century, the time of the creative career of [[James George Frazer]]. With the loss of interest in overarching theories and development-problems bound to the late colonial era, witch-hunts and witchcraft-beliefs were treated as an issue of specialists. Ethnograhpies divide sharply in critical reports of violence and in rationalizations of witchcraft-beliefs as useful functions according to paradigms of [[structural functionalism]] with its main proponents [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] and his student [[E.E. Evans-Pritchard]]. In this tradition, the focus of research was shifted on supposed social functions of witchcraft-beliefs and less frequent, violent witch-hunts. Both were considered as ensuring the survival and identity of an ingroup. 
One of the last competing generalizing theorists was [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]]. He collected material of societies that were first contacted by the source writing about its behaviour. He then provides evidence of counterproductive witch-hunting that serves no real social function, but arises from an entirely different worldview, the "prelogic" mindset opposed to logic.

'''Negrescence''' is a word with a [[Latin]] origin. It describes a process of becoming black or developing a racial identity. It can also refer to having a dark complexion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/62/N0106200.html ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition'', Houghton Mifflin Company, 2000.] This word apparently dates from about 1745 in English. This word is sometimes spelled "[[nigrescence]]." &lt;/ref&gt;

Negrescense extends through history by those victimized by racism and white supremacy. Psychological adaptations instigated identity formation for persons of African American descent.   

In 1885, [[John Beddoe]] compiled an index of negrescence to analyze the population of the [[British Isles]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Races of Britain: a Contribution to the Anthropology of Western Europe. Bristol and London'', John Beddoe, 1885, republished by Hutchinson, London, 1971, {{ISBN|0-09-101370-4}}. &lt;/ref&gt; Beddoe used the physical descriptions of a population of 13,000 males to compile his index. He gave one point to a male with red or blonde hair. He gave one point to men with dark hair as well. A black-haired male was given two points. If the male had brown- or chestnut-colored, hair, they were considered neutral. He created a map that showed distribution of negrescence in Britain. This map was recreated and published by [[Robert Howard Hodgkin|R. H. Hodgkin]] in 1935. It showed that the hair color of men in western Scotland, Wales, and Ireland was darker than the hair color of males in eastern England and eastern Scotland.  

This analysis was used to support Beddoe's theory that the Irish had the physical characteristics of the indigenous, aboriginal people of the British Isles. 

[[Professor William E. Cross, Jr.]] of the City University of New York's Graduate Center included a theory of Nigrescence in his groundbreaking book ''Shades of Black: Diversity in African American Identity'', which was published in 1991. His theory assumed that African Americans proceed through a series of distinct psychological stages as they move from self-degradation to self-pride over time. 

Charles Thomas came up with the concept of negromachy. He believed there was a confusion of self-worth where the person shows inappropriate dependence on white society for self definition. He created a five stage nigrescence model.   

Bailey Jackson created a four stage nigrescense model.  

Frantz Fanon coined the term "To become black" which meant as a process of developing a black identity under conditions of oppression.

[[File:Nigeria Communications Commission, Abuja, FCT.png|thumb|The Nigeria Communications Commission HQ building, Abuja, FCT]]
The '''Nigerian Communications Commission''' ('''NCC''') is the independent regulatory authority for the telecommunications industry in Nigeria. The NCC was created under Decree number 75 by the [Federal Military Government of Nigeria] on 24 November 1992. The NCC was charged with the responsibility of regulating the supply of telecommunications services and facilities, promoting competition, and setting performance standards for telephone services in Nigeria. The Decree has been abrogated and replaced with the Nigerian Communications Act (NCA) 2003.

== Organizational structure ==
The commission is headed by a board of nine commissioners, composed of the Chairman (a non-executive commissioner), the Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive Officer, two Executive Commissioners, and five other non-executive commissioners.

There are 20 departments, one directorate three other administratively constitutive sections which are the Offices of the Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive, and the Offices of the two Executive Commissioners. The Departments of New Media and Information Security; Technical Standards and Network Integrity; and Spectrum Administration report to the Executive Commissioner Technical Services. The Departments of Legal and Regulatory Services; Licensing and Authorization; Consumer Affairs; and Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement report to the Executive Commissioner Stakeholder Management. The remaining Departments report to the Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive Officer. Among the Departments that report to the EVC/CEO is the Universal Service Provision Fund - established under the Nigerian Communications Act 2003 to facilitate the achievement of national policy goals for universal access and universal service to information and communication technologies (ICTs) in rural, un-served and under-served areas in Nigeria. The Fund is being managed to facilitate the widest possible access to affordable telecommunications services for greater social equity and inclusion for the people of Nigeria.

Northern Telecom (more commonly known as [[Nortel]]) manufactured several different models of [[Payphone]] over the years. They were most commonly used in [[Canada]], as well as the [[United States]].

[[Nortel]] has manufactured several types in [[Canada]]:

==Early payphones==

* N213H-3
* N233H

==Series 200/ QSD-3A==

Northern Electric, Nortel's previous name made chrome payphones in the 1950s. The same phone was also made by [[Western Electric]].

==Centurion==
[[File:Payphone - Truro (25245578602).jpg|thumb|200px|dial pad from Centurion payphone]]

Nortel Centurion were made in the 1970s-1980s and used coins only. They came in black, brown, blue, or green cases. Initial units used a rotary dial system and later units were touch tone key pad. Coin slot accepted denominations of 5, 10 and 25 cents. Centurions had a coin return button.

Centurion were used by [[Bell Canada]], [[Manitoba Telecom Services|MTS]], Telephone Milot
and other local phone companies in [[Canada]]. Additionally, Centurions were used by companies in the [[United States]] such as [[Embarq]], and a number of other independent telephone companies.

==Millennium==

[[File:Phone Booth (4311957783).jpg|thumb|200px|Bell Canada phone booth with Millennium phone visible]]
[[File:BellPayPhone3.jpg|thumb|upright|Bell Millennium phone]]
[[File:NORTEL MILLENNIUM PAYPHONE 09112017.jpg|thumb|upright|NORTEL MILLENNIUM for NTT (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Co., Ltd.) Japan]]

The Millennium line was introduced in the 1990s and allowed the use of coins (5, 10, 25 cents and 1 dollar for Canadian versions) and cards (credit card or phone cards as well as "smart" chip cards.) They were equipped with an advanced electronic coin validator, which could detect slugs or coin blockages. These units came with a touch tone key pad only. A display screen allowed the user to view the number dialed and switch between two languages, where the operating company has a choice of any combination of English, French, Spanish and Japanese. The VFD display also allows the operating company to set scrolling messages and ads, with a total of 20 messages possible in total, 10 for on hook and 10 for off hook. &lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.muc.ccc.de/millennium:voiceware&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.muc.ccc.de/millennium:displayprompts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20010503180348/http://www.quortech.com/documents/prod_details/products_multi_details.html&lt;/ref&gt;

These units were used by:

* [[Bell Canada]]
* [[Telus]]
* [[Qwest]]
* [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]]
* [[Sasktel]]
* [[Telebec]]
* Telephone de Nantes
* Telephone de Warwick
* US West Express
* GTE
* Nevada Bell
* [[Embarq]]

Millennium phones require a CO line with polarity reversal for CDR ([[call detail record]]) purposes, as well as for coin return, hence these phones have no coin return button. 

The rights to Millennium phones were sold to [[QuorTech]] when [[Nortel]] moved away from manufacturing phone devices, and were subsequently sold to WiMacTel. Quortech has all but disappeared from the public and in March of 2014, [[WiMacTel]] announced they were the only operator of Millennium payphones in Canada and the US. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://www.wimactel.com/wimactel-finishes-the-play-and-is-now-canadas-only-nationwide-provider-of-pay-phones/|title=WiMacTel finishes the play and is now Canada’s only nationwide provider of pay phones.|website=wimactel.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The phones themselves are quite complex, using a Zilog Z80 processor with a number of peripherals attached. The whole point of the Millennium system was security and advanced monitoring. All Millennium phones connect to a server platform called Millennium Manager, which allows the operating company to control and monitor virtually every aspect of a phone. The phones 'call home' on a regular basis, uploading CDR records if they are full and reporting coinbox status (down to the amount of coins in a given denomination). The coin vault lock has a small micro switch that can detect break ins, which will cause the phone to call into the Millennium Manager with an alarm. The main housing lock also has a similar switch, which if triggered without entering the craft interface beforehand will trigger an alarm as well.  

A Mondex version of the payphone was also produced, it has a special larger display with navigation keys. There is also an inmate version of the card only set, as well as a smaller deskset that used only a card reader. The desk set closely resembled a regular Meridian M7310 office phone. These smaller sets were often found in malls and hospitals. 

These phones can sometimes be found on eBay for relatively cheap, though one cannot do much with them without the connection to the Millennium Manager. There are a few active projects which are trying to solve this problem however.

The '''Ordos''' ([[Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet|Mongolian Cyrillic]]: Ордос) are a [[Mongols|Mongol]] subgroup that live in Uushin district, [[Inner Mongolia]] of China. Ordos literally means plural of [[Ordo (palace)|Ordo]].

The Three Tribes of [[Uriyangkhai]]d, [[Tümed]] in north [[Shanxi]], Ordos Mongols in [[Ordos Desert|Ordos]] and north of [[Shensi]] extended southward beyond the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] defense zone in the 14-15th centuries. Since 1510, the Ordos were ruled by descendants of [[Batumongke Dayan Khan]].

The Ordos Mongols believe that they have been responsible for the [[Mausoleum of Genghis Khan|shrine]] of [[Genghis Khan]] since their inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gKRrVu0fBn8C|title=Mongolian Music, Dance, &amp; Oral Narrative: Performing Diverse Identities|last=Pegg|first=Carole|date=2001|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=9780295981123|page=26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the modern place where mausoleum of Genghis Khan located is inhabited by the [[Darkhad]]s because the Ordos Mongols were forced to be resettled outside Ordos grasslands. Traditionally, Ordos territory is divided into 7 banners.

Their number reached 64,000 in 1950 and a possible current estimate of the Ordos people might be less than 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DuCRAgAAQBAJ|title=The Mongolic Languages|last=Janhunen|first=Juha|date=2006-01-27|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135796907|page=193|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public opinion on the 2009 Honduran coup d'état''' is divided in [[Honduras]]. There are three known opinion polls on the [[2009 Honduran constitutional crisis]]. The polls show polarized Honduras. The first CID-Gallup showed support for President [[Manuel Zelaya]]'s removal from office because of his actions but not the manner in which it was carried out. Subsequent opinion polls showed higher levels of opposition to the events of the coup, though the opinion of the government it inaugurated was more evenly mixed. According to the latest poll in October, only 48% of Hondurans regard Roberto Micheletti's performance as good or excellent, and 50% as bad or poor. [[Porfirio Lobo Sosa]], an opposition member, led polls before the November elections and subsequently won the elections.

==Before the coup==
In a 2008 survey, only one in four Hondurans approved Zelaya - the lowest approval rate of 18 regional leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.americaeconomia.com/Multimedios/Otros/7468.pdf | title=APROBACIÓN DE MANDATARIOS - AMÉRICA Y EL MUNDO, Abril 2009 | publisher=Mitofsky | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m8mX2NSk | archivedate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 22 ''La Prensa'' counted that people had organized 18 Facebook groups against Manuel Zelaya. Tens of thousands Hondurans had joined the Internet campaigns against Zelaya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.laprensa.hn/Sintesis/Lo-ultimo/Ediciones/2009/06/23/Noticias/Mel-y-la-cuarta-urna-pierden-en-Internet | title=Mel y la cuarta urna pierden en Internet  | publisher=La Prensa | date=2009-06-23 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m8mz3FjW | archivedate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion polls==
{{Honduran post-coup polls}}

===CID-Gallup poll comment===

CID-Gallup conducted a poll in 16 of the nation's [[Departments of Honduras|18 departments]] between 30 June and 4 July, but the results were reported initially to the press on 9 July and 10 July, leading to confusion.  Honduran newspapers, such as ''[[El Heraldo (Honduras)|El Heraldo]]'', and some news sources outside Honduras, such as the ''[[Washington Post]]'', reported that when asked whether they believed the removal of President Zelaya was justified, 41% agreed, 28% disagreed, and 31% said don't know/won't answer.&lt;ref name="WAPOST_2009_07_09"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/09/AR2009070902820.html|title= In Honduras, One-Sided News of Crisis|date=2009-07-09|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|first=Juan|last=Forero|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ELH_2009_07_09"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elheraldo.hn/index.php/Ediciones/2009/07/09/Noticias/Mayoria-cree-que-sucesion-fue-justificada|title=Mayoría cree que sucesión fue justificada|date=2009-07-09|publisher=[[El Heraldo (Honduras)|El Heraldo]]|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''New York Times'', the Associated Press, and others reported, possibly based upon an interview of the President of CID-Gallup, that 46% disagreed with Zelaya's ouster, 41% approved of it, with 13% declining to answer.&lt;ref name="AP_2009_07_10"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jAkMGKIUDg_ngUiZboxQbYj5_DPwD99BRHI00|title=Chavez attacks US plan to solve Honduras coup|date=2009-07-10|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|first=Marienela|last=Jimenez|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url==https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/11/world/americas/11honduras.html |title=?? |date=2009-07-10 |accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A blogger obtained the original data from CID-Gallup&lt;ref name="cidgallup_4641poll"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =[[CID-Gallup]] | coauthors =| title =Honduras: "A Divided Nation" | work =| publisher =[[CID-Gallup]]| date =July 2009| url =http://www.cidgallup.com/Documentos/Boletin_OP_HONDURAS_71%20Englishv2.pdf |format =[[Portable Document Format]] | doi =| accessdate =2009-08-25 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jIElrHhs |archivedate=2009-08-25 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and explained the inconsistency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloggingsbyboz.com/ |title=Poll Numbers!!! Divided in Honduras |date=2009-07-10 |accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CID-Gallup asked two different questions:

:Q: Do you consider the actions taken by Mel Zelaya with respect to the fourth ballot box to have justified his dismissal from the post of President of the Republic?
:''¿Considera usted que las acciones que tomó Mel Zelaya con respecto a la cuarta urna justificaban su destitución del puesto de Presidente de la República?''
:Yes 41%, No 28%, Don't know/No answer: 31%.

:Q: Are you in accord with the action taken last Sunday that removed President Zelaya from the country?
:''¿Cuánto está usted de acuerdo con la acción que se tomó el pasado domingo que removió el Presidente Zelaya del país?''
:Support 41%, Oppose 46%, Don't know/No Answer 13%.

Some press sources reported the results from the first question, and some the results from the second question.

'''Racial profiling''' is the act of suspecting or targeting a person of a certain [[Race (human categorization)|race]] on the basis of observed or assumed characteristics or behavior of a racial or [[ethnic group]], rather than on individual suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Profiling |encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate® Dictionary, Eleventh Edition |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/profiling }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Warren 2009 52–63"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warren|first=Patricia Y.|last2=Farrell|first2=Amy|date=2009|title=The Environmental Context of Racial Profiling|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=623|pages=52–63|jstor=40375886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racial profiling, however, isn't limited only to an individuals race, but can also be based on the individual’s ethnicity, religion, or national origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aclu.org/other/racial-profiling-definition|title=Racial Profiling: Definition|work=American Civil Liberties Union|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; More commonly in the United States, racial profiling is referred to regarding its use by [[Law enforcement in the United States|law enforcement]] at the local, state, and federal levels, and its use leading to discrimination against people in the African American, Native American, Asian, Latino, Arab, and Muslim communities of the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aclu.org/report/persistence-racial-and-ethnic-profiling-united-states|title=The Persistence Of Racial And Ethnic Profiling In The United States|work=American Civil Liberties Union|access-date=2017-03-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In European countries, the term "ethnic profiling" is also used instead of racial profiling. Although most prominent in law enforcement, everyday racial profiling refers to the common, everyday attacks on an individuals race, ethnicity, religion or national origin and it is more common than people think. It doesn't just hurt the victims. It has an insidious ripple effect on the rest of society -- in business, health and public safety.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/11/us/everyday-racial-profiling-consequences-trnd/index.html|title=This is why everyday racial profiling is so dangerous|last=Yan|first=Holly|date=|website=CNN|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the obvious racial comments and actions, those who experience everyday racial profiling can endure serious health consequences and can suffer from high rates of chronic diseases.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; On a more personal level, those holding racial biases are actually harming themselves, too. When you start feeling anxiety about someone's race, Godsil, director of research for the Perception Institute said, it triggers the amygdala -- the part of the brain that's activated by fear which means higher level of stress on your body. Delinking oneself from racial stereotypes is a good way to be free from that bias and is mentally beneficial as well. &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These biases are especially harmful as majority of the time, these biases are placed in our minds from an early age through mass media such as verbal slurs, ethnic jokes and acts of discrimination and once ingrained, they are hard to reverse. Since these prejudices and stereotypes are seen at such an early age, they become something of second nature. Racial profiling often stems from what researchers call "implicit bias" -- a bias we might not be consciously aware of.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

According to the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU):
&lt;blockquote&gt;'Racial profiling' refers to the practice by law enforcement officials of targeting individuals for suspicion of crime based on the individual's race, ethnicity, religion or national origin. Criminal profiling, generally, as practiced by police, is the reliance on a group of characteristics they believe to be associated with crime. Examples of racial profiling are the use of race to determine which drivers to stop for minor traffic violations (commonly referred to as 'driving while black or brown'), or the use of race to determine which pedestrians to search for illegal contraband.&lt;ref name="aclu"&gt;{{cite web|title = Racial Profiling: Definition|url = https://www.aclu.org/racial-profiling-definition|website = American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Besides such disproportionate searching of [[African Americans]], and members of other minority groups,&lt;ref name="Gale"&gt;"Racial Profiling" (2010), ''Gale Encyclopedia of American Law'', edited by Donna Batten. 3rd ed., vol. 8, Detroit: Gale. pp. 233-238. Retrieved via ''Gale Virtual Reference Library'' database, January&amp;nbsp;8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; other examples of racial profiling by law enforcement in the U.S. include the targeting of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] in the investigation of [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration]];&lt;ref name="aclu"/&gt; and the focus on [[Middle East]]ern and [[South Asians]] present in the country in screenings for ties to [[Islamic terrorism]].&lt;ref name="Gale"/&gt; These suspicions are typically on the basis of racist, and/or derogatory beliefs about the group of target, and assumes the criminal ideologies of one individual from a specific racial group is a trait held by all members of that racial group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bou-Habib|first=Paul|date=2011|title=Racial Profiling and Background Injustice|journal=The Journal of Ethics|volume=15|issue=1/2|pages=33–46|jstor=41486899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Minnesota House of Representatives]] analyst Jim Cleary, "there appears to be at least two clearly distinguishable definitions of the term 'racial profiling': a narrow definition and a broad definition... Under the narrow definition, racial profiling occurs when a police officer stops and/or searches someone solely on the basis of the person's race or ethnicity... Under the broader definition, racial profiling occurs whenever police routinely use race as a factor that, along with an accumulation of other factors, causes an officer to react with suspicion and take action."&lt;ref name="cleary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/raceprof.pdf|title=Racial Profiling Studies in Law Enforcement: Issues and Methodology|last=Cleary|first=Jim|date=June 2000|publisher=Minnesota House of Representatives Research Department|pages=5–6|accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by Domestic Human Rights Program of Amnesty International USA, found that racial profiling has increased since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and that state laws cannot provide sufficient and consistent protections against racial profiling.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;"Threat and Humiliation: Racial Profiling, Domestic Security, and Human Rights in the United States". U.S. Domestic Human Rights Program. ''Amnesty International USA Publications.'' September 2004, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Sociologist Robert Staples emphasizes that racial profiling in the U.S. is "not merely a collection of individual offenses" but, rather, a systemic phenomenon across American society, dating back to the era of slavery, and, until the 1950s, was, in some instances, "codified into law".&lt;ref name="Staples"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staples|first=Robert|title=White Power, Black Crime, and Racial Politics|journal=Black Scholar|year=2011|volume=41|issue=4|pages=31–41; here: section "Historical  Background"|doi=10.5816/blackscholar.41.4.0031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enshrinement of racial profiling ideals in United States law can be exemplified by several major periods in U.S. history.

In 1693, Philadelphia's court officials gave police legal authority to stop and detain any Negro (freed or enslaved) seen wandering about.&lt;ref name="Staples" /&gt; Starting around the mid 18th century, slave patrols were used to stop slaves at any location in order to ensure they were being lawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/slave-patrols|title=Slave Patrols|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 19th century, the [[Black Codes (United States)]], a set of statutes, laws and rules, were enacted in the South in order to regain control over freed and former slaves and relegate African Americans to a lower social status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/black-codes|title=black codes facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about black codes|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar discriminatory practices continued through the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] era.&lt;ref name="Staples" /&gt;

Prior to U.S. immigration restrictions following the [[September 11 attacks]], Japanese immigrants were rejected U.S. citizenship during [[World War II]], for fear of disloyalty following the attacks on [[Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pitt|first=Cassady|date=2011|title=U.S. PATRIOT ACT AND RACIAL PROFILING: ARE THERE CONSEQUENCES OF DISCRIMINATION?|journal=Michigan Sociological Review|volume=25|pages=53–69|jstor=41289191}}&lt;/ref&gt; What resulted was the government's preemptive [[internment of Japanese Americans|internment]] of more than 100,000 Japanese immigrants and Japanese American citizens during World War II, as a measure against potential Japanese espionage, constituting a form of racial profiling.&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Staples" /&gt;

In the late 1990s racial profiling became politicized, when police and other law enforcement fell under scrutiny for the disproportionate traffic stops of minority motorists.&lt;ref name="Warren 2009 52–63"/&gt;  Researchers from the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) provided evidence of widespread racial profiling, one study showed that while blacks only made up 42 percent of [[New Jersey]]'s driving population they accounted for 79 percent of motorists stopped in the state.

===Supreme Court cases===
''Terry v. Ohio'' was the first challenge to racial profiling in the United States in 1968. This case was about African American people who were thought to be stealing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"Terry v. Ohio." ''Oyez'', &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1967/67&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Accessed 5 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The police officer arrested the three men and searched them and found a gun on two of the three men, and Terry (one of the three men searched) was convicted and sentenced to jail.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Terry challenged the arrest on the grounds that it violated the search and seizure clause of the Fourth Amendment, however, in an 8-1 ruling, the Supreme Court decided that the police officer acted in a reasonable manner, and with reasonable suspicion, under the Fourth Amendment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The decision in this case allowed for greater police discretion in identifying suspicious or illegal activities.

In 1975, ''U.S. v. Brignoni- Ponce'' was decided. Felix Humberto Brignoni-Ponce was traveling in his vehicle and was stopped by border patrol agents because he appeared to be Mexican.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;"United States v. Brignoni -Ponce." ''Oyez'', &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1974/74-114&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Accessed 5 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The agents questioned Ponce and the other passengers in the car and discovered that the passengers were illegal immigrants, and the border agents subsequently arrested all occupants of the vehicle.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Court determined that the testimonies that led to the arrests in this case were not valid, as they were obtained in the absence of reasonable suspicion and the vehicle was stopped without probable cause, as required under the Fourth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/422/873.html|title=FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|website=Findlaw|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''U.S. v. Armstrong'' that disparity in conviction rates is not unconstitutional in the absence of data that "similarly situated" defendants of another race were disparately prosecuted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/95-157.ZO.html |title=Cornell Law School |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aele.org/zoufal.html |title=Other Documents: Developments in Racial Profiling Litigation |publisher=Aele.org |accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; overturning a 9th Circuit Court ruling that was based on "the presumption that people of all races commit all types of crimes – not with the premise that any type of crime is the exclusive province of any particular racial or ethnic group", waving away&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/517/456/case.html|title=United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456 (1996)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; challenges based on the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]] which guarantees the right to be safe from search and seizure without a warrant (which is to be issued "upon probable cause"), and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] which requires that all citizens be treated equally under the law. To date there have been no known cases{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} in which any U.S. court dismissed a [[Selective prosecution|criminal prosecution]] because the defendant was targeted based on race. This Supreme Court decision doesn't prohibit government agencies from enacting policies prohibiting it in the field by agents and employees.

The Court also decided the case of ''[[Whren v. United States]]'' in 1996. Whren was arrested on felony drug charges after officers observed his truck sitting at an intersection for a long period of time before it failed to use its turn signal to drive away, and the police officers stopped his vehicle for the traffic violation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;"Whren v. United States." ''Oyez'', &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1995/95-5841&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Accessed 5 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon approaching the vehicle the officers observed that Whren was in possession of crack-cocaine.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Court determined the officers did not violate the Fourth Amendment through an unreasonable search and seizure and that the officers were permitted to stop the vehicle after it committed a traffic violation and the subsequent search of the vehicle was permitted regardless of the pretext of the officers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In June 2001 the [[Bureau of Justice Assistance]], a component of the Office of Justice Programs of the United States Department of Justice, awarded a Northeastern research team a grant to create the web-based Racial Profiling Data Collection Resource Center. It now maintains a website designed to be a central clearinghouse for police agencies, legislators, community leaders, social scientists, legal researchers, and journalists to access information about current data collection efforts, legislation and model policies, police-community initiatives, and methodological tools that can be used to collect and analyze racial profiling data. The website contains information on the background of data collection, jurisdictions currently collecting data, community groups, legislation that is pending and enacted in states across the country, and has information on planning and implementing data collection procedures, training officers in to implement these systems, and analyzing and reporting the data and results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=201 |title=Racial Profiling Data Collection Resource Center |url=http://www.racialprofilinganalysis.neu.edu/index.php |publisher=[[The Institute on Race and Justice at Northeastern University]] |accessdate=March 31, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409024222/http://www.racialprofilinganalysis.neu.edu/index.php |archivedate=April 9, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statutory law===
In April 2010, Arizona enacted [[Arizona SB 1070|SB 1070]], a law that would require law-enforcement officers to verify the citizenship of individuals they stop if they have reasonable suspicion that they may be in the United States illegally. The law states that "Any person who is arrested shall have the person's immigration status determined before the person is released". United States federal law requires that all immigrants who remain in the United States for more than 30 days register with the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-8263.html|title=INA: ACT 262 - REGISTRATION OF ALIENS IN THE UNITED STATES|last=|first=|date=|website=US Citizenship and Immigration Services|access-date=January 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, all immigrants age 18 and over are required to have their registration documents with them at all times&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-8289.html#0-0-0-310|title=INA: ACT 264 - FORMS AND PROCEDURE|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services|access-date=January 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Arizona made it a misdemeanor crime for an illegal immigrant 14 years of age and older to be found without carrying these documents at all times.

According to SB 1070, law-enforcement officials may not consider "race, color, or national origin" in the enforcement of the law, except under the circumstances allowed under the United States and Arizona constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;Nier, Jason, Samuel Gaetner, et al.

United States|was struck down]] by the [[United States Supreme Court]], while the provision allowing for an immigration check on detained persons was upheld.&lt;ref name= nyt&gt;{{cite news |title= Supreme Court Rejects Part of Arizona Immigration Law |first1= Adam |last1= Liptak |first2= Adam H. |last2= Cushman Jr. |date= June 25, 2012 |work= The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/us/supreme-court-rejects-part-of-arizona-immigration-law.html?_r=1&amp;hp }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states contain "stop and identify" laws that allow officers to detain suspected persons and ask for identification, and if there is failure to provide identification punitive measures can be taken by the officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.copblock.org/28042/let-me-see-your-i-d/|title="Let Me See Your I.D."

In early 2001, a bill was introduced to Congress named "End Racial Profiling Act of 2001" but lost support in the wake of the September 11th attacks.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.civilrights.org/publications/reports/racial-profiling2011/the-end-of-racial.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/|title=The End Racial Profiling Act of 2010|work=The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights|access-date=2017-03-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306134200/http://www.civilrights.org/publications/reports/racial-profiling2011/the-end-of-racial.html?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F|archive-date=2017-03-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was re-introduced to Congress in 2010 but also failed to gain the support it needed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Several U.S. states now have reporting requirements for incidents of racial profiling. Texas, for example requires all agencies to provide annual reports to its Law Enforcement Commission. The requirement began on September 1, 2001, when the State of Texas passed a law to require all law enforcement agencies in the state to begin collecting certain data in connection to traffic or pedestrian stops beginning on January 1, 2002. Based on that data, the law mandated law enforcement agencies to submit a report to the law enforcement agencies' governing body beginning March 1, 2003 and each year thereafter no later than March 1. The law is found in the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure beginning with Article 2.131.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.new-braunfels.tx.us/index.aspx?NID=828|title=Racial Profiling Report|year=2001|publisher=New Braunfels, Texas|accessdate=March 31, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723104438/http://www.ci.new-braunfels.tx.us/index.aspx?NID=828|archivedate=July 23, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, on January 1, 2011, all law enforcement agencies began submitting annual reports to the Texas State Law Enforcement Officers Standards and Education Commission. The submitted reports can be accessed on the Commission's website for public review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcleose.state.tx.us/content/racial_profile_reports.cfm|title=Texas Law Enforcement Agency Racial Profiling Reports Submitted to TCLEOSE|year=2010|publisher=[[Texas Commission on Law Enforcement Officer Standards and Education]]|accessdate=March 31, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220003800/https://www.tcleose.state.tx.us/content/racial_profile_reports.cfm|archivedate=February 20, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2003 the Department of Justice issued its ''Guidance Regarding the Use of Race by Federal Law Enforcement Agencies'' forbidding racial profiling by federal law enforcement officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/racial_profiling/report/index.html|title=Threat and Humiliation: Racial Profiling, National Security, and Human Rights in the United States|year=2007|publisher=[[Amnesty International USA]]|accessdate=November 18, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915032800/http://www.amnestyusa.org/racial_profiling/report/index.html|archive-date=September 15, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support===
Supporters defend the practice of racial profiling by emphasizing the [[crime control|crime control model]].&lt;ref name=GOFF&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goff|first1=Colin|title=Criminal Justice in Canada|date=2014|publisher=Nelson Education|location=Toronto, ON|pages=180–187|edition=6th|ref=GOFF}}&lt;/ref&gt; They claim that the practice is both efficient and ideal due to utilizing the [[probability theory|laws of probability]] in order to determine one's [[crime|criminality]].&lt;ref name=GOFF/&gt; This system focuses on controlling crime with swift judgment, bestowing full [[discretion]] on police to handle what they perceive as a threat to society.&lt;ref name=GOFF/&gt;
The use and support of racial profiling has surged in recent years, namely in North America due to heightened tension and awareness following the events of [[September 11 Attacks|9/11]].&lt;ref name=GALE&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomson Gale|title=Racial Profiling|date=2006|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=Farmington Hill, MI|pages=71–79|ref=GALE}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the issue of profiling has created a debate that centers on the values of [[social Equality|equality]] and [[Right of self-defense|self-defense]].&lt;ref name=GALE/&gt; Supporters uphold the stance that sacrifices must be made in order to maintain national safety, even if it warrants [[Bias|differential treatment]].&lt;ref name=GALE/&gt; According to a 2011 survey by Rasmussen Reports, a majority of Americans support profiling as necessary "in today's society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/lifestyle/general_lifestyle/november_2011/60_say_profiling_necessary_in_today_s_society |title=60% Say Profiling Necessary in Today's Society - Rasmussen Reports™ |publisher=Rasmussenreports.com |date=2011-11-04 |accessdate=2011-12-21}}{{unreliable source?|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Page|first=Susan|title=Poll: Most support ethnic profiling in air security|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-01-12-poll-terrorism-obama_N.htm|newspaper=USA Today|date=January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2010/05/two-national-polls-show-arizona-immigration-law-very-popular.html|title=Arizona Immigration Law Has Broad Support Across U.S., New Polls Show|work=PBS NewsHour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, Fernando Mateo, then president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers, made pro-racial profiling remarks in the case of gun-shot taxi-cab driver: "You know sometimes it's good that we are racially profiled because the God's-honest truth is that 99 percent of the people that are robbing, stealing, killing these drivers are blacks and Hispanics."  "Clearly everyone knows I'm not racist. I'm Hispanic and my father is black. ... My father is blacker than [[Al Sharpton]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amny.com/urbanite-1.812039/taxi-advocate-to-hacks-profile-your-passengers-1.2522015 Taxi advocate to hacks: 'profile your passengers'].

They emphasize that numerous factors (such as race, interactions, and dress) are used to determine if a person is involved in criminal activity and that race is not a sole factor in the decision to detain or question an individual.&lt;ref name="cleary" /&gt; They further claim that the job of policing is far more imperative than to concerns of minorities or interest groups claiming unfair targeting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Crime in Canadian Context Second Edition-William O'Grady&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of racial profiling believe that inner city residents of Hispanic communities are subjected to racial profiling because of theories such as the "gang suppression model". The "gang suppression model" is believed by some to be the basis for increased policing, the theory being based on the idea that Latinos are violent and out of control and are therefore "in need of suppression".&lt;ref name="Duran, J. Rober 2009"&gt;Duran, J. Rober. "Legitimated Oppression: Inner-City Mexican American Experiences with Police Gang Enforcement". Journal of Contemporary Ethnography (April 2009) 39: 143-168. Sage Journals&lt;/ref&gt; Based on research, the criminalization of a people can lead to abuses of power on behalf of law enforcement.&lt;ref name="Duran, J. Rober 2009" /&gt;

===Criticism===
Critics of racial profiling argue that the individual rights of a suspect are violated if race is used as a factor in that suspicion. Notably, civil liberties organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) have labeled racial profiling as a form of [[discrimination]], stating, "Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, [[religion]], [[nationality]] or on any other particular identity undermines the basic human rights and freedoms to which every person is entitled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/racial-justice/racial-profiling |title=Racial Profiling - Recent Court Cases, Issues and Articles &amp;#124; American Civil Liberties Union |publisher=Aclu.org |accessdate=2011-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, those in opposition of the police tactic employ the teachings of the [[due process|due process model]], arguing that [[minority group|minorities]] are not granted equal rights and are thus subject to unjust treatment.&lt;ref name=GOFF/&gt; In addition, some argue that the singling out of individuals based on their [[ethnic group|ethnicity]] comes in violation of the [[Rule of Law]], having voided all instance of [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]].&lt;ref name=GALE/&gt; 
Those in opposition also make note of the role that the [[news media]] plays within the conflict. The general public [[internalization|internalizes]] much of its knowledge from the media, relying on sources to convey information of events that transpire outside of their immediate domain.&lt;ref name=FLERAS&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fleras|first1=Augie|title=The Media Gaze: Representations of DIversities in Canada|date=2011|publisher=UBC Press|location=Vancouver, BC|pages=25–33|ref=FLERAS}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with this power, media outlets are aware of the public's intrigue with [[controversy]] and have been known to construct headlines that entail [[moral panic]] and negativity.

In the case of racial profiling drivers, the ethnic backgrounds of drivers stopped by traffic police in the U.S. suggests the possibility of biased policing against non-white drivers.&lt;ref name="William 2002 179–205"&gt;{{cite journal|last=William|first=Rose|date=Winter 2002|title=Crimes of Color: Risk, Profiling, and the Contemporary Racialization of Social Control|journal=International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society|series=2|volume=16|issue=2|pages=179–205|doi=10.1023/a:1020572912884}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black drivers felt that they were being pulled over by law enforcement officers simply because of their skin color. However, some argue in favor of the "veil of darkness" hypothesis, which states that police are less likely to know the race of a driver before they make a stop at nighttime as opposed to in the daytime. Referring to the veil of darkness hypothesis, it is suggested that if the race distribution of drivers stopped during the day differs from that of drivers stopped at night, officers are engaging in racial profiling. For example, in one study done by Jeffrey Grogger and Greg Ridgeway, the veil of darkness hypothesis was used to determine whether or not racial profiling in traffic stops occurs in Oakland, California. The conductors found that there was little evidence of racial profiling in traffic stops made in Oakland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grogger|first=Jeffrey|year=2006|title=Testing for Racial Profiling in Traffic Stops from behind a Veil of Darkness|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|series=475|volume=101|issue=475|pages=878–887|doi=10.1198/016214506000000168|author2=Greg Ridgeway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research through random sampling in the South Tucson, Arizona area has established that immigration authorities sometimes target the residents of barrios with the use of possibly discriminatory policing based on racial profiling.&lt;ref name="Duran, J. Rober 2009" /&gt; Author Mary Romero writes that immigration raids are often carried out at places of gathering and cultural expression such as grocery stores based on the fluency of language of a person (e.g. being bilingual especially in Spanish) and skin color of a person.&lt;ref name="Romero, Mary 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romero|first=Mary|year=2006|title=Racial Profiling And Immigration Law Enforcement: Rounding Up Of Usual Suspects In The Latino Community|journal=Critical Sociology|volume=32|issue=2–3|pages=447–473|doi=10.1163/156916306777835376}}&lt;/ref&gt; She goes on to state that immigration raids are often conducted with a disregard for due process, and that these raids lead people from these communities to distrust law enforcement.&lt;ref name="Romero, Mary 2006" /&gt;

In a recent journal comparing the 1990s to the present, studies have established that when the community criticized police for targeting the black community during traffic stops it received more media coverage and toned down racial profiling.  However, whenever there was a significant lack of media coverage or concern with racial profiling, the amount of arrests and traffic stops for the African-American community would significantly rise again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farrell|first=Amy|year=2009|title=The Environmental Context of Racial Profiling|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=623|pages=52–63|doi=10.1177/0002716208330485|author2=Warren, Patricia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NYPD Demographics Unit===
Between 2003 and 2014, the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD) operated the ''Demographics Unit'' (later renamed ''Zone Assessment Unit'') which mapped communities of 28 "ancestries of interest", including those of Muslims, Arabs, and Albanians. Plain-clothed detectives were sent to public places such as coffee shops, mosques and parks to observe and record the public sentiment, as well as map locations where potential terrorists could "blend in". In its 11 years of operation, however, the unit did not generate any information leading to a criminal charge. A series of publications by the [[Associated Press]] during 2011–12 gave rise to public pressure to close the unit, and it was finally disbanded in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Apuzzo| first = Matt|author2=Joseph Goldstein | title = New York Drops Unit That Spied on Muslims| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2014-04-17| date = 2014-04-15| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/16/nyregion/police-unit-that-spied-on-muslims-is-disbanded.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial profiling not only occurs on the streets but also in many institutions. Much like the book ''Famous all over Town'' where the author [[Daniel Lewis James|Danny Santiago]] mentions this type of racism throughout the novel. According to Jesper Ryberg's 2011 article "Racial Profiling And Criminal Justice" in the ''Journal of Ethics'', "It is argued that, given the assumption that criminals are currently being punished too severely in Western countries, the apprehension of more criminals may not constitute a reason in favor of racial profiling at all." It has been stated in a scholarly journal that for over 30 years the use of racial and/or demographic profiling by local authorities and higher level law enforcement's continue to proceed. NYPD Street cops use racial profiling more often, due to the widespread patterns. They first frisk them to check whether they have enough evidence to be even arrested for the relevant crime. "As a practical matter, the stops display a measurable racial disparity: black and Hispanic people generally represent more than 85 percent of those stopped by the police, though their combined populations make up a small share of the city's racial composition."

The NYPD has been subject to much criticism for its "stop and frisk" tactics. According to statistics on the NYPD's stop and frisk policies, collected by the Center for Constitutional Rights,{{when|date=March 2017}} 51% of the people stopped by the police were Black, 33% were Latino, and 9% were White, and only 2% of all stops resulted in contraband findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ccrjustice.org/|title=Center for Constitutional Rights|website=Center for Constitutional Rights|language=en|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{nonspecific|date=March 2017}} Starting in 2013, use of racial profiling by the NYPD was drastically curtailed, as New York Mayor [[Bill de Blasio]] was campaigning for the office, and this policy has continued into his term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2016/12/de-blasio-on-stop-and-frisk-we-changed-it-intensely-107886|title=De Blasio on stop-and-frisk: 'We changed it intensely'|work=Politico PRO|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] and [[the Pentagon]] have led to targeting of some Muslims and Middle Easterners as potential terrorists and, according to some, are targeted by the national government through preventive measures similar to those practiced by local law enforcement.&lt;ref name="murray1"&gt;Murray, Nancy. "Profiling in the Age of Total Information Awareness." Race &amp; Class.  Journal of Race and Class. Web. 20 March 2012. &lt;http://rac.sagepub.com/content/52/2/3.full.pdf html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The national government has passed laws, such as the [[Patriot Act]] of 2001, to increase surveillance of potential threats to national threat as a result of the events that occurred during 9/11.&lt;ref&gt;Siggins, Peter. "Racial Profiling in an Age of Terrorism." Santa Clara University. Web. 24 February 2012. http://www.scu.edu/ethics/publications/ethicalperspectives/profiling.html.&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that the passage of these laws and provisions by the national government leads to justification of preventative methods, such as racial profiling, that has been controversial for racial profiling and leads to further minority distrust in the national government.&lt;ref name="murray1" /&gt; One of the techniques used by the FBI to target Muslims was monitoring 100 mosques and business in Washington DC and threatened to deport Muslims who did not agree to serve as informers.&lt;ref name="murray1" /&gt; The FBI denied to be taking part in blanket profiling and argued that they were trying to build trust within the Muslim community.&lt;ref name="murray1" /&gt;

On September 14, 2001 three days after the [[September 11th attacks]], an Indian American motorist and three family members were pulled over and ticketed by a Maryland state trooper because their car had broken taillights. The trooper interrogated the family, questioned them about their nationality, and asked for proof of citizenship. When the motorist said that their passports were at home, the officer allegedly stated, "You are lying. You are Arabs involved in terrorism." He ordered them out of the car, had them put their hands on the hood, and searched the car. When he discovered a knife in a toolbox, the officer handcuffed the driver and later reported that the driver "wore and carried a butcher knife, a dangerous, deadly weapon, concealed upon and about his person." The driver was detained for several hours but eventually released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://civilrights.org/publications/reports/ |title=Reports |publisher=Civilrights.org |accessdate=2013-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820170850/http://www.civilrights.org/publications/reports/ |archive-date=2013-08-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.creators.com/opinion/walter-williams/is-profiling-racist.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119003520/http://www.creators.com/opinion/walter-williams/is-profiling-racist.html |archivedate=2015-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2001, an American citizen of Middle Eastern descent named Assem Bayaa cleared all the security checks at [[Los Angeles]] airport and attempted to board a flight to [[New York City]]. Upon boarding, he was told that he made the passengers uncomfortable by being on board the plane and was asked to leave. Once off the plane, he wasn't searched or questioned any further and the only consolation he was given was a boarding pass for the next flight. He filed a lawsuit on the basis of discrimination against [[United Airlines]]. United Airlines filed a counter motion which was dismissed by a district judge on October 11, 2002. In June 2005, the ACLU announced a settlement between Bayaa and United Airlines who still disputed Bayaa's allegations, but noted that the settlement "was in the best interest of all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=ACLU and United Airlines Announce Settlement of Case on Behalf of Plaintiffs Assem Bayaa and American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee|date=June 17, 2005|publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union]]|url=https://www.aclu.org/racial-justice/aclu-and-united-airlines-announce-settlement-case-behalf-plaintiffs-assem-bayaa-and-a|accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The events of 9/11 also led to restrictions in immigration laws.&lt;ref name="murray1" /&gt; The U.S. government imposed stricter immigration quotas to maintain national security at their national borders. In 2002, men over sixteen years old who entered the country from twenty-five Middle Eastern countries and North Korea were required to be photographed, fingerprinted, interviewed and have their financial information copied, and had to register again before leaving the country&lt;ref name="murray1" /&gt; under the [[National Security Entry-Exit Registration System]]. No charges of terrorism resulted from the program, and it was deactivated in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.progressive.org/news/2015/11/188438/registry-muslims-has-already-created-decade-profiling-and-fear|title=Registry for Muslims Has Already Created A Decade of Profiling and Fear {{!}} The Progressive|website=www.progressive.org|access-date=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, 18 young men from the [[Greater Toronto Area|GTA]] were charged with [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiring]] to carry out a series of bombings and beheadings, resulting in a swell of media coverage.&lt;ref name="FLERAS" /&gt; Two media narratives stood out with the former claiming that a ''militant subculture'' was forming within the Islamic community while the latter attributed the case to a bunch of [[deviance (sociology)|deviant]] youth who had too much [[testosterone]] brewing.&lt;ref name="FLERAS" /&gt; Eventually, it was shown that government officials had been tracking the group for some time, having supplied the youth with the necessary [[chemical compound|compounds]] to create explosives, prompting critics to discern whether the whole situation was a [[frameup|set-up]].&lt;ref name="FLERAS" /&gt; Throughout the case, many factors were put into question but none more than the [[Muslim]] community who faced much scrutiny and vitriol due to the build-up of negative headlines stemming from the media.&lt;ref name="FLERAS" /&gt;

===Studies===
Statistical data demonstrates that although policing practices and policies vary widely across the United States, a large disparity between racial groups in regards to traffic stops and searches exists. However, whether this is due to racial profiling or the fact that different races are involved in crime in different rates, is still highly debated.  Based on academic search, various studies have been conducted regarding the existence of racial profiling in traffic and pedestrian stops. For motor vehicle searches, academic research showed that the probability of a successful search is very similar across races. This suggests that police officers are not motivated by racial preferences but by the desire to maximize the probability of a successful search. Similar evidence has been found for pedestrian stops, with identical ratios of stops to arrests for different races.&lt;ref name="knowles_persico_todd"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knowles|first=John|author2=Nicola Persico|author3=Petra Todd|title=Racial Bias in Motor Vehicle Searches: Theory and Evidence|journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]]|volume=109|issue=1|pages=203–229|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|location=|doi=10.1086/318603|date=February 2001|issn=0022-3808|jstor=318603|url=http://www.ssc.upenn.edu/econ/CARESS/CARESSpdf/99-06.pdf|access-date=2018-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011044157/http://www.ssc.upenn.edu/econ/CARESS/CARESSpdf/99-06.pdf|archive-date=2008-10-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/26/opinion/26macdonald.html?ref=opinion|title=Fighting Crime Where the Criminals Are|last=Mac Donald|first=Heather|date=June 25, 2010|work=New York Times|accessdate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The studies have been published in various Academic Journals aimed towards Academic professionals as well practitioners such as law enforcers. Some of these journals include, Police Quarterly and the Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice, so that both sides of the argument are present and evaluated. Of those gathered the most noted study refuting racial profiling was the conducted using the veil of darkness hypothesis stating that it will be difficult, if not impossible, for officers to discern race in the twilight hours. The results of this study concluded that the ratio of different races stopped by New York cops is about the same for all races tested.&lt;ref name="Worden_McLean_Wheeler"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Worden |first=Robert |author2=Sarah McLean |author3=Andrew Wheeler  |title= Testing for Racial Profiling With the Veil-of-Darkness Method |journal=[[Police Quarterly]]|volume=15|issue=1|pages=92–111|url=http://pqx.sagepub.com/content/15/1/92.short |doi=10.1177/1098611111433027|year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most referenced organizations, who offer evidence on the existence of racial profiling, are The American Civil Liberties Union, which conducted studies in various major U.S. cities, and RAND. In a study conducted in Cincinnati, Ohio, it was concluded that "Blacks were between three and five times more likely to (a) be asked if they were carrying drugs or weapons, (b) be asked to leave the vehicle, (c) be searched, (d) have a passenger searched, and (e) have the vehicle physically searched in a study conducted. This conclusion was based on the analysis of 313, randomly selected, traffic stop police tapes gathered from 2003 to 2004."&lt;ref name="Dixon_Schell_Giles_Drogos"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Dixon |first= T. |author2=T.

A 2001 study analyzing data from the [[Richmond, Virginia]] Police Department found that African Americans were disproportionately stopped compared to their proportion in the general population, but that they were not searched more often than Whites.

=== Racial Profiling in Retail ===
Shopping experiences is one of the many examples where everyday racial profiling occurs. Discrimination alters the experience of shopping, arguably raising the costs and reducing the rewards derived from consumption. When a store’s sales staff is hesitant to serve black shoppers or suspects that they are prospective shoplifters, shopping no longer becomes a form of leisure. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/get-there/wp/2018/05/17/shopping-while-black-african-americans-continue-to-face-retail-racism/|title=Perspective {{!}} Shopping while black. African Americans continue to face retail racism.|last=http://www.facebook.com/MichelleSingletary|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not only based on the costumers skin color, but by simply pre-judging based on the persons appearance is still a way of contributing to this issue. Racial profiling in retail has become so prominent, that over the years, researchers developed the term "shopping while black" which describes the experience of being denied service or given poor service because one is black. Usually, it involves a black person being followed around or closely monitored by a clerk or guard who suspects he or she may steal, but it can also involve being denied store access, being refused service, use of ethnic slurs, being searched, being asked for extra forms of identification, having purchases limited, being required to have a higher credit limit than other customers, being charged a higher price, or being asked more rigorous questions on applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=2kIEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=%22shopping+while+black%22+shoplifting&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WN1qgKQnBR&amp;sig=zTJtM0CGtMdV1Mfy8gpTEUlJt0A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DnMwUMKXEqnriwLF44DwBg&amp;sqi=2&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22shopping%20while%20black%22%20shoplifting&amp;f=false|title=The Crisis|last=Inc|first=The Crisis Publishing Company|date=November–December 2001|publisher=The Crisis Publishing Company, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These negative shopping experiences contribute to the decline of shopping in stores as people prefer to shop online to avoid these sort of interactions that are deemed degrading, embarrassing, and highly offensive. Many research experiments have been conducted to measure outsiders response to the treatment of people. Findings have been both positive and negative with some having the courage to speak up about the issue and defend the victim, while others simply stand by and watch while this discrimination occurs.

===Public opinion===

====Perceptions of race and safety====
In a particular study, Higgins, Gabbidon, and Vito studied the relationship between public opinion on racial profiling in conjunction with their viewpoint of race relations and their perceived awareness of safety.  It was found that race relations had a statistical correlation with the legitimacy of racial profiling. Specifically, results showed that those who believed that racial profiling was widespread and that racial tension would never be fixed were more likely to be opposed to racial profiling than those who did not believe racial profiling was as widespread or that racial tensions would be fixed eventually. On the other hand, in reference to perception of safety, the research concluded that one's perception of safety had no influence on public opinion of racial profiling. Higgins, Gabbidon, and Vito acknowledge that this may not have been the case immediately after 9/11, but state that any support of racial profiling based on safety was "short-lived".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Higgins|first=George|author3=Shaun Gabbidon|author2=Gennaro Vito |title=Exploring the Influence of Race Relations and Public Safety on Public Support for Racial Profiling during Traffic Stops|journal=International Journal of Police Science &amp; Management|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Influence of religious affiliation====
One particular study focused on individuals who self-identified as religiously affiliated and their relationship with racial profiling. By using national survey data from October 2001, researcher Phillip H. Kim studied which individuals were more likely to support racial profiling. The research concludes that individuals that identified themselves as either Jewish, Catholic, or Protestant showed higher statistical numbers that illustrated support for racial profiling in comparison to individuals who identified themselves as non-religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Devon|title=Attitudes Toward the use of Racial/Ethnic Profiling to Prevent Crime and Terrorism|journal=Public Administration Review|year=2011|doi=10.1177/0887403411381801|volume=22|issue=4|pages=422–447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contexts of terrorism and crime====
After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, according to Johnson, a new debate concerning the appropriateness of racial profiling in the context of terrorism took place. According to Johnson, prior to the September 11, 2001 attacks the debate on racial profiling within the public targeted primarily African-Americans and Latino Americans with enforced policing on crime and drugs.  The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon changed the focus of the racial profiling debate from street crime to terrorism. According to a June 4–5, 2002 FOX News/Opinion Dynamics Poll, 54% of Americans approved of using "racial profiling to screen Arab male airline passengers." A 2002 survey by Public Agenda tracked the attitudes toward the racial profiling of Blacks and people of Middle Eastern descent. In this survey, 52% of Americans said there was "no excuse" for law enforcement to look at African Americans with greater suspicion and scrutiny because they believe they are more likely to commit crimes, but only 21% said there was "no excuse" for extra scrutiny of Middle Eastern people.&lt;ref name="Kim 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Phillip|title=Conditional Morality?: Attitudes of Religious Individuals toward Racial Profiling|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|year=2004|doi=10.1177/0002764203261068|volume=47|issue=7|pages=879–895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, using data from an internet survey based experiment performed in 2006 on a random sample of 574 adult university students, a study was conducted that examined public approval for the use of racial profiling to prevent crime and terrorism.  It was found that approximately one third of students approved the use of racial profiling in general.  Furthermore, it was found that students were equally likely to approve of the use of racial profiling to prevent crime as to prevent terrorism-33% and 35.8% respectively.  The survey also asked respondents whether they would approve of racial profiling across different investigative contexts. 

The data showed that 23.8% of people approved of law enforcement using racial profiling as a means to stop and question someone in a terrorism context while 29.9% of people approved of racial profiling in a crime context for the same situation. It was found that 25.3% of people approved of law enforcement using racial profiling as a means to search someone's bags or packages in a terrorism context while 33.5% of people approved of racial profiling in a crime context for the same situation. It was also found that 16.3% of people approved of law enforcement wire tapping a person's phone based upon racial profiling in the context of terrorism while 21.4% of people approved of racial profiling in a crime context for the same situation.  It was also found that 14.6% of people approved of law enforcement searching someone's home based upon racial profiling in a terrorism context while 18.2% of people approved of racial profiling in a crime context for the same situation.&lt;ref name="Kim 2004"/&gt;

The study also found that white students were more likely to approve of racial profiling to prevent terrorism than nonwhite students. However, it was found that white students and nonwhite students held the same views about racial profiling in the context of crime. It was also found that foreign born students were less likely to approve of racial profiling to prevent terrorism than non-foreign born students while both groups shared similar views on racial profiling in the context of crime.&lt;ref name="Kim 2004"/&gt;

==In other countries==

===Canada===
Accusations of racial profiling of [[visible minorities]] who accuse police of targeting them due to their ethnic background is a growing concern in [[Canada]]. In 2005, the [[Kingston Police]] released the first study ever in Canada which pertains to racial profiling. The study focused on the city of [[Kingston, Ontario]], a small city where most of the inhabitants are white. The study showed that black skinned people were 3.7 times more likely to be pulled over by police than white skinned people, while Asian people were less likely to be pulled over than whites or blacks.&lt;ref name="cbc_study"&gt;{{cite news|title=Police stop more blacks, Ont. study finds|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/police-stop-more-blacks-ont-study-finds-1.565724|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=June 8, 2010 | date=May 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several police organizations condemned this study and suggested more studies like this would make them hesitant to pull over visible minorities.

[[Canadian Aboriginals]] are more likely to be charged with crimes, particularly on [[Indian reserves|reserves]]. The Canadian crime victimization survey does not collect data on the ethnic origin of perpetrators, so comparisons between incidence of victimizations and incidence of charging are impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Statistics Canada|title=Victimization and offending among the Aboriginal population in Canada|volume=26|issue=3|author1=Jodi-Anne Brzozowski |author2=Andrea Taylor-Butts |author3=Sara Johnson |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/olc-cel?lang=eng&amp;catno=85-002-X20060039199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although aboriginal persons make up 3.6% of Canada's population, they account for 20% of Canada's prison population. This may show how racial profiling increases effectiveness of police, or be a result of racial profiling, as they are watched more intensely than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www41.statcan.ca/2006/2693/ceb2693_002-eng.htm|title=Aboriginal people over-represented in Saskatchewan's prisons|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=2010-03-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227153925/http://www41.statcan.ca/2006/2693/ceb2693_002-eng.htm|archivedate=2009-02-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, an investigation of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' daily newspaper found that black people across Toronto were three times more likely to be stopped and documented by police than white people. To a lesser extent, the same seemed true for people described by police as having "brown" skin ([[South Asian Canadian|South Asians]], [[Arab Canadians|Arabs]] and [[Latin American Canadians|Latinos]]) . This was the result of an analysis of 1.7 million contact cards filled out by [[Toronto Police]] officers in the period 2003–2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/761551--when-good-people-are-swept-up-with-the-bad|title=When good people are swept up with the bad|date=2010-02-06|work=[[Toronto Star]]|accessdate=July 29, 2010|quote=When good people are swept up with the bad - We're not trying to make any excuses for this. We recognize that bias in police decision making is a big, big issue for us, and so we're working really hard on it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ontario Human Rights Commission]] states that "[[police service]]s have acknowledged that racial profiling does occur and have taken [and are taking] measures to address [the issue], including upgrading training for officers, identifying officers at risk of engaging in racial profiling, and improving community relations"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=Curt|title=Canadian Police Work|year=2008|publisher=Nelson Education|location=Toronto|isbn=0176424105|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Griffiths, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;311). [[Ottawa Police]] addressed this issue and planned on implementing a new policy regarding officer racially profiling persons, "the policy explicitly forbids officers from investigating or detaining anyone based on their race and will force officers to go through training on racial profiling"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ottawa police introduce new racial profiling policy|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20110816/racial-profiling-policy-110816/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723024712/http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20110816/racial-profiling-policy-110816/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CTV News, 2011). This policy was implemented after the 2008 incident where an African-Canadian woman was [[strip searched]] by members of the Ottawa police. There is a [[surveillance video|video]] showing the [[strip search]] where one witnesses the black woman being held to the ground and the having her bra and shirt cut ripped/cut off by a member of the Ottawa Police Force which was released to the viewing of the public in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ottawa police introduce new racial profiling policy|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20110816/racial-profiling-policy}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; (CTV News, 2011).

===Germany===
As of February 2012, there has been a first court ruling concerning racial profiling in German police policy. It had at first been declared legal for police to make skin color and "non-German ethnic origin" criteria for the selection of persons who will be asked for identification in spot-checks for illegal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=German Press Review on Court Ruling Allowing Police Checks Based on Skin Color|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-press-review-on-court-ruling-allowing-police-checks-based-on-skin-color-a-824601.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in subsequence to the ruling it was decided legal for a subject of such a spot-check to compare such policy to that of the [[SS]] in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anwaltskanzlei Sven Adam Polizei-, Ordnungs- und Versammlungsrecht Oberlandesgericht Frankfurt am Main - Az.: 2 Ss 329/11|url=http://www.anwaltskanzlei-adam.de/index.php?id=106,753,0,0,1,0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A higher court later declared the earlier decision to be void and the racial profiling to have been unlawful and in violation of anti-discrimination provisions in Art. 3 Basic Law and the General Equal Treatment Act of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://taz.de/Urteil-zu-Kontrollen-nach-Hautfarbe/!104549/ Urteil zu Kontrollen nach Hautfarbe: Gericht verbietet Polizei-Rassismus], TAZ, accessed on October 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil rights organisation Büro zur Umsetzung von Gleichbehandlung (Office for the Implementation of Equal Treatment) makes a distinction between criminal profiling, which is legitimate in Germany, and ethnic profiling, which is not.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bug-ev.org/en/topics/focus-areas/dossiers/ethnic-profiling/what-is-ethnic-profiling.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report conducted by the Interior ministry in Germany, there has been a recent increase in hate crimes and violence against migrant groups in Germany.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39096833|title=Germany hate crime: Nearly 10 attacks a day on migrants in 2016|date=2017-02-26|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-03-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reports concluded that there were more than 10 attacks per day against migrants in Germany in 2016.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This report from Germany garnered the attention of the United Nations, which alleged that people of African descent face widespread discrimination in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/un-says-racial-profiling-widespread-in-germany/|title=UN says racial profiling widespread in Germany|date=2017-02-28|work=POLITICO|access-date=2017-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights released a statement in 2016 after a visit to Germany which stated that "although the [German] constitution guarantees equality, bans racial discrimination and enshrines the inviolability of human dignity, these principles are not put into practice." &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/news/378941-racism-germany-un-statement/|title=Racial profiling against Africans 'endemic' in Germany – UN experts|work=RT International|access-date=2017-03-07|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights further asserts that people of African descent, in particular, face high rates of racial profiling from law enforcement officials and high levels of discrimination and defines the problem of racial profiling and discrimination as "endemic".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Israel===
{{main|Racial profiling in Israel}}
In 1972, [[terrorists]] from the [[Japanese Red Army]] launched an [[Lod Airport massacre|attack]] that led to the deaths of at least 24 people at [[Ben Gurion Airport]]. Since then, security at the airport has relied on a number of fundamentals, including a heavy focus on what Raphael Ron, former director of security at Ben Gurion, terms the "human factor", which he generalized as "the inescapable fact that [[terrorist attack]]s are carried out by people who can be found and stopped by an effective security methodology."&lt;ref name="B"&gt;SecuritySolutions.com [http://securitysolutions.com/news/security_exposing_hostile_intent/ What can we learn from Ben Gurion Airport in Israel to help push aviation security in the U.S. to the next level?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006081007/http://securitysolutions.com/news/security_exposing_hostile_intent |date=2016-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its focus on this so-called "human factor," Israeli security officers interrogate travelers using racial profiling, singling out those who appear to be [[Arab]] based on name or physical appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Herald Tribune]], [http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/09/africa/ME-Israel-Airport-Dance.php Israeli airport security order dancer to prove identity with dance steps], September 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, all passengers, including those who do not appear to be of Arab descent, are questioned as to why they are traveling to Israel, followed by several general questions about the trip in order to search for inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;Volokh.com [http://volokh.com/posts/1196146293.shtml Airport Security in Israel], November 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Although numerous [[civil rights]] groups{{which|date=September 2016}} have demanded an end to the profiling, the Israeli government maintains that it is both effective and unavoidable. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasisi|first=Badi|last2=Margalioth|first2=Yoram|last3=Orgad|first3=Liav|date=2012|title=Ethnic Profiling In Airport Screening: Lessons From Israel, 1968-2010|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/42705624|journal=American Law and Economics Review|volume=14|issue=2|pages=517–560}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ariel Merari]], an Israeli terrorism expert,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-11770842|title=New study delves inside a suicide bomber's mind|last=Lee|first=Dave|date=2010-11-17|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|accessdate=September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "it would be foolish not to use profiling when everyone knows that most terrorists come from certain ethnic groups. They are likely to be [[Muslim]] and young, and the potential threat justifies inconveniencing a certain [[ethnic group]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23714853/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/rights-group-challenges-israels-airport-security/#.Tqdw24YWXv4|title=Rights group challenges Israel's airport security|last=|first=|date=March 19, 2008|work=|newspaper=Associated Press|via=|accessdate=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
The General Law on Population (Reglamento de la Ley General de Poblacion) of 2000 in Mexico has been cited as being used to racially profile and abuse immigrants to Mexico.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/may/3/mexicos-illegals-laws-tougher-than-arizonas/|title=Mexico’s illegals laws tougher than Arizona's|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|work=The Washington Times|access-date=2017-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican law makes illegal immigration punishible by law and allows law officials great discretion in identifying and questioning illegal immigrants.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Mexico has been criticized for its immigration policy. Chris Hawley of ''[[USA Today]]'' stated that "Mexico has a law that is no different from Arizona's", referring to legislation which gives local police forces the power to check documents of people suspected of being in the country illegally.&lt;ref name="usa-mex-law"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2010-05-25-mexico-migrants_N.htm | title=Activists blast Mexico's immigration law | author=Hawley, Chris | newspaper=[[USA Today]] | date=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Immigration and human rights activists have also noted that Mexican authorities frequently engage in racial profiling, harassment, and shakedowns against migrants from Central America.&lt;ref name="USA-mex-law" /&gt;

===Spain===

Racial profiling by police forces in Spain is a common practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The police have arrested me 160 times just because of my appearance|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/01/07/inenglish/1389099066_776750.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the [[University of Valencia]], found that people of non-white aspect are up to ten times more likely to be stopped by the police on the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Identificación policial por perfil étnico en españa|url=http://www.uv.es/garciaj/pub/2013_perfil_etnico.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] accused Spanish authorities of using racial and ethnic profiling, with police singling out people who do not look [[White people|Caucasian]] in the street and public places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spain police accused of racial profiling
|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/spain-police-accused-of-racial-profiling-6276849.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD)]] urged the Spanish government to take "effective measures" to ethnic profiling, including the modification of existing laws and regulations which permit its practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Examen de los informes presentados por los Estados partes de conformidad con el artículo 9 de la Convención: España|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/co/Spain_AUV_sp.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|UN Special Rapporteur]], [[Mutuma Ruteere]], described the practice of ethnic profiling by Spanish law enforcement officers "a persisting and pervasive problem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Mutuma Ruteere|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session23/A.HRC.23.56.Add.3_ENG.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Spanish government approved a law which prohibited racial profiling by police forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interior prohíbe por ley las identificaciones por razones étnicas|url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/politica/inerior-prohibe-por-ley-las-identificaciones-por-razones-etnicas-3372691 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several [[NGO|NGO's]] claim identity checks which are carried out on grounds of skin color and ethnicity are still widely practiced despite the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Denuncian en España controles policiales por motivos racistas|url=http://www.hispantv.com/newsdetail/Reportajes/32343/Denuncian-en-Espana-controles-policiales-por-motivos-racistas

In [[inoculation theory]], refutational preemption consists of “specific content that receivers can employ to strengthen attitudes against subsequent change.”{{R|"KYLE1997"}} Drawing on [[William J. McGuire|McGuire]] &amp; Papageorgis, Pfau, et al. define the refutational preemption, or [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pretreatment pretreatment], step of the inoculation [[process]]: "The [[theory]] posits that refutational pretreatments, which raise the specter of content potentially damaging to the receiver’s attitude while simultaneously providing direct [[refutation]] of that content in the presence of a supportive environment, threaten the [[individual]]. This triggers the [[motivation]] to bolster [[arguments]] supporting the receiver’s attitudes, thus conferring resistance".{{R|"Pfau1990"}}

Instead of providing the receiver with additional supporting [[evidence]] why their held [[beliefs]] are true, the receiver is provided [[counterarguments]] they may encounter in the future that might challenge their held belief. The effectiveness of this inoculation falls off as the level of effort required by the receiver to defend the belief increases.{{R|"McGuire1961"}}

'''Sergio De La Pava''' (born 1970/71) is an American novelist and lawyer. He is best known for his novel ''[[A Naked Singularity]]''.

== Biography ==

Sergio De La Pava was born and raised in [[New Jersey]], to parents who immigrated from [[Colombia]]. He attended Brooklyn Law School, where he met his wife. They live in New Jersey with their two children.&lt;ref name="chicago tribune"&gt;Julia Keller. "[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-05-31/entertainment/ct-prj-0603-naked-singularity-20120531_1_event-horizon-black-hole-glance/3 The 'Naked' Truth]", ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

He works as a public defender in Manhattan,&lt;ref name="new york magazine"&gt;Lauren Sandler. [http://nymag.com/news/articles/reasonstoloveny/2013/public-defender-sergio-de-la-pava/ 27. Because This Public Defender Is Also a PEN Award–Winning Novelist]. ''[[New York Magazine]]'', December 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; where he handles 70 to 80 cases at a time. He says of that work, "The stakes are a lot higher in that world than whether or not my book gets attention. On a given day, I have someone who really needs my help on a serious matter."&lt;ref name="Catton, Wall Street Journal"&gt;Pia Catton. "[https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB100014240527023038364045774727639551607 Author find his own way, to success]", ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', June 17, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

In 2008, De La Pava self-published his first novel, ''[[A Naked Singularity]]'' through [[XLibris]].&lt;ref name="the millions"&gt;Garth Risk Hallberg. "[http://www.themillions.com/2012/06/outside-the-ring-a-profile-of-sergio-de-la-pava.html Outside the Ring: A Profile of Sergio De La Pava]", ''[[The Millions]]'', June 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010, literary site The Quarterly Conversation ran a review by Scott Bryan Wilson that called the book "one of the best and most original novels of the decade" and "a towering, impressive work." &lt;ref name="the quarterly conversation"&gt;Scott Bryan Wilson. "[http://quarterlyconversation.com/a-naked-singularity-by-sergio-de-la-pava Reviewed: A Naked Singularity by Sergio De La Pava]". ''The Quarterly Conversation'', October 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; That review caught the eye of staff at [[The University of Chicago Press]], who signed the book up and published it in paperback in April 2012. The book was named one of the ten best works of fiction of 2012 by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref name="Best Fiction, Wall Street Journal"&gt;"The Best Fiction of 2012", ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', December 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Chicago Tribune]], [[Julia Keller]] wrote, "''A Naked Singularity'' is not about physics. It's about the American criminal justice system in a large and chaotic city, a place slowly crushed by hopelessness in the same way that an ancient star is gradually crushed by gravity. . . . It is about a city that teeters on the edge of total collapse and complete disaster, but that has the capacity to right itself (whew!) at the last possible second." &lt;ref name="chicago tribune"/&gt; ''A Naked Singularity'' went on to win the [[PEN/Robert W. Bingham Prize]] from [[PEN American Center|PEN]] as the best debut novel of that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pen.org/literature/2013-penrobert-w-bingham-prize-0 "2013 PEN/Robert W.

In April 2011, De La Pava self-published his second novel, ''Personae''. The University of Chicago Press published a new paperback edition of that book in September 2013. In the ''Wall Street Journal'', Sam Sacks wrote, "[I]n this willfully cryptic book, Mr. De La Pava's sense of moral urgency is ever-present.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5406">'''Sex on Premises Venue''' ('''SOPV''') is the term used primarily in British and Australian medical literature for the various commercial venues expressly for engaging in public sex, as opposed to spaces such as [[park]]s which may be used for sexual behavior but are intended for general public use.

A similar term, "on-premises club", is used by heterosexual [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swingers]] to describe a [[sex club]] in which non-commercial sexual activity takes place between clients or members.

While the term is primarily used with respect to [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM), at least one piece of legislation (the ''Sex Work Act'' in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria, Australia]]) uses "sex on premises venue" to mean "any venue where a person is required to pay an admission fee or charge to enter the venue for the purpose of engaging in sexual activities with another person who has also entered the venue on the same terms and who did not receive any form of payment or reward, whether directly or indirectly, for engaging in sexual activities".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/swa1994129/s3b.html SEX WORK ACT 1994 - SECT 3B], Exemptions for sex on premises venues, Queen's Printer, Victoria, Australia 1994&lt;/ref&gt; This wording, while gender-neutral, would explicitly exclude [[brothel]]s.

==MSM sex-on-premises venues==
Men who have sex with men (MSM) SOPV'ss include [[gay bathhouse]]s, "backrooms", and "club" style venues that have no spa or sauna.&lt;ref name=QX759&gt;{{citation|journal=QX Magazine London |date= |publisher=QX |accessdate=2009-10-25 |issue= |page=50 |title=QX Magazine London Issue 759 24th September 2009|url=http://viewer.zmags.com/showmag.php?mid=rqrdts#/page50 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927044345/http://viewer.zmags.com/showmag.php?mid=rqrdts |archivedate=27 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most gay bathhouses, bookstores, and bars in the United States do not openly advertise their actual sex-on-premises purpose or activity, as SOPVs elsewhere can.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

"Backrooms" consisting of small cubicles with expensive-to-view video machines are usually attached to an adult bookstore. Sometimes there are [[Glory hole (sexual)|glory holes]] between the cubicles. The cubicles are also referred to as ''private viewing rooms'' or ''cruise lounges''.  "Backrooms" of pubs or bars are usually darkened rooms with or without continuous (and free) [[pornographic]] films, but without any dividers or privacy, encouraging group sex.

Club style SOPVs are an entire venue {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} and often consist of small cubicles, sometimes with no bed or mattress,  unlike gay bathhouses which usually have some kind of comfort amenities in individual rooms.

Some bathhouses sell alcohol;{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} pubs and bars sell alcohol but are prohibited from marketing themselves as SOPVs. Sometimes special events are held at pubs or bars that include sexual activity without causing the venue to be classified as an SOPV.

SOPVs are recognized by some city planners as part of the management strategy for [[safer sex|sexually transmitted disease education]] and part of catering for a city's cultural diversity and tourist industry.&lt;ref name=Prior2008 &gt;{{citation | last=Prior | first=Jason | year=2008 | title=Planning for Sex in the City: urban governance, planning and the placement of sex industry premises in inner Sydney | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | journal=[[Australian Geographer]] | pages=339–352 | volume=39 | issue = 3 | issn=0004-9182 | oclc=360672708 | doi=10.1080/00049180802270531}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MullensA2009 &gt;{{citation | author=Mullens A.B | year=2009 | title=Sex on premises venue (SOPV) health promotion project in response to sustained increases in HIV notifications | last2=Debattista | first2=J | last3=Staunton | first3=S | last4=Hamernik | first4=E | journal=Sexual Health | pages=41–44 | volume=6 | location=n1 (2009 03 11) | issn=1448-5028 | oclc=423544035 | doi=10.1071/sh07087}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Waitt2006 &gt;{{citation | last1=Waitt | first1=Gordon | year=2006 | title=Gay tourism: culture and context | first2=Kevin | last2=Markwell | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-7890-1603-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9v84NxERpjQC | page=114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etiquette ==
Bookstore-backroom SOPVs may be free to enter, costing only for the film or video, or may have an admission charge.

Club style SOPVs may have regular themes such as underwear, boots only,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080330033451/http://www.thefortlondon.com/ The Fort], London, example of Boots Only nights.&lt;/ref&gt; [[fisting]] or [[Urolagnia|piss]] nights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080110055347/http://www.centralstation.co.uk/sop.html Central Station (archive)], London, ''SOP'' piss night example.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stanley Newcomb Kenton''' (December 15, 1911 – August 25, 1979) was an American [[popular music]] and [[jazz]] artist. As a [[pianist]], [[composer]], arranger and band leader he led an innovative and influential [[jazz orchestra]] for almost four decades. Though Kenton had several pop hits from the early 1940s into the 1960s, his music was always forward looking. Kenton was also a pioneer in the field of jazz education, creating the [[Stan Kenton Band Clinics|Stan Kenton Jazz Camp]] in 1959 at [[Indiana University]].&lt;ref name = "SPARKE1"&gt;Sparke, Michael. ''Stan Kenton: This is an Orchestra.'' UNT Press (2010). {{ISBN|978-1-57441-325-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Stan Kenton was born on December 15, 1911, in [[Wichita, Kansas]]; he had two sisters (Beulah and Erma Mae) born three and eight years after him. His parents, Floyd and Stella Kenton, had moved the family back to [[Colorado]], then, finally in 1924 to the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]], settling in [[Bell, California|suburban Bell, California]].&lt;ref name=SPARKE1/&gt;

Kenton attended [[Bell High School (Bell, California)|Bell High School]]; his high-school yearbook picture has the prophetic notation "Old Man Jazz". Kenton started learning [[piano]] as a teen from a local pianist and organist. When he was around 15 and in high school, pianist and arranger Ralph Yaw introduced him to the music of [[Louis Armstong]] and [[Earl Hines]]. He graduated from high school in 1930.

By the age of 16, Kenton was already playing a regular solo piano gig at a local hamburger eatery for 50 cents a night plus tips; during that time he had his own performing group named "The Bell-Tones". His first arrangement was written during this time for a local eight-piece band that played in nearby [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]].&lt;ref name=SPARKE1/&gt;

==Career==
===1930s===
In April 1936 [[Gus Arnheim]] was reorganizing his band into the style of [[Benny Goodman]]'s groups and Kenton was to take the piano chair.  This is where Kenton would make his first recordings when Arnheim made 14 sides for the Brunswick label in summer of 1937.  Once he departed from [[Gus Arnheim]]'s group, Kenton went back to study with private teachers on both the piano and in composition.  In 1938 Kenton would join [[Vido Musso]] in a short-lived band but a very educational experience for him.

From the core of this group come the line up of the first Stan Kenton groups of the 1940s.  Kenton would also go on to working with the [[House band|NBC House Band]] and in various Hollywood studios and clubs. Producer [[George Avakian]] took notice of Kenton during this time while he worked as the pianist and Assistant Musical Director at the [[Earl Carroll Theatre#Sunset Boulevard|Earl Carroll Theatre Restaurant in Hollywood]]. Kenton started to get the idea of running his own band from this experience; he created a rehearsal band of his own which eventually become his group in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=SPARKE1/&gt;

===1940s===
[[File:Stan Kenton Billboard 3.jpg|Stan Kenton in ''Billboard'' magazine, October 1942|thumb|right]]
In June 1941, Kenton formed his first orchestra. Kenton worked in the early days with his own groups as much more of an [[arrangement|arranger]] than a featured pianist. Although there were no "name" musicians in his first band (with the possible exception of bassist [[Howard Rumsey]] and trumpeter [[Alfred "Chico" Alvarez|Chico Alvarez]]), Kenton spent the summer of 1941 playing regularly before an audience at the [[Rendezvous Ballroom]] in Balboa Beach, CA. Influenced by [[Benny Carter]] and [[Jimmie Lunceford]], the Stan Kenton Orchestra struggled for a time after its initial success. Its [[Decca Records|Decca]] recordings were not big sellers and a stint as Bob Hope's backup radio band during the 1943–44 season was an unhappy experience; [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]] permanently took Kenton's place.&lt;ref name=ALLMUSIC&gt;{{cite web |author=Scott Yanow |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/stan-kenton-mn0000743929/biography |title=Stan Kenton &amp;#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009123746/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/stan-kenton-mn0000743929/biography |archivedate=October 9, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stan Kenton and Eddie Safranski, 1947 or 1948 (William P. Gottlieb 04871).jpg|Stan Kenton with bassist Eddie Safranski, 1947 or 1948|thumb|left]]
Kenton's first appearance in New York was in February 1942 at the [[Roseland Ballroom]], with the marquee featuring an endorsement by [[Fred Astaire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spelvin|first1=George|title=Broadway Beat|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/40s/1942/Billboard%201942-02-21.o.pdf|accessdate=29 March 2015|agency=Billboard|date=February 21, 1942|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1943, with a contract with the newly formed [[Capitol Records]], a popular record in "Eager Beaver", and growing recognition, the Stan Kenton Orchestra was gradually catching on; it developed into one of the best-known West Coast ensembles of the 1940s. Its soloists during the war years included [[Art Pepper]], briefly [[Stan Getz]], altoist [[Boots Mussulli]], and singer [[Anita O'Day]]. By 1945, the band had evolved.&lt;ref name="ALLMUSIC" /&gt; The songwriter [[Joe Greene (American songwriter)|Joe Greene]] provided the lyrics for hit songs like "[[And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine]]" and "[[Don't Let the Sun Catch You Cryin']]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ref={{harvid|Joseph Greene, Composer ...

====Artistry in Rhythm====

When composer/arranger [[Pete Rugolo]] joined the Stan Kenton Orchestra as staff arranger in late 1945 he brought with him his love of jazz, [[Stravinsky]] and [[Bartók]]. Given free rein by Kenton, Rugolo experimented. Although Kenton himself was already trying experimental scores prior to Rugolo's tenure, it was Rugolo who brought extra jazz and classical influences much needed to move the band forward artistically.

During his first six months on the staff, Rugolo tried to copy Kenton's sound; on encouragement from the leader he explored his own voice. By incorporating compositional techniques borrowed from the modern classical music he studied, Rugolo was a key part of one its most fertile and creative periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthingskenton.com/table_of_contents/articles/rugolo/|title=All Things Kenton - Pete Rugolo and Progressive Jazz|author=|date=|website=All Things Kenton|accessdate=April 30, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207140341/http://allthingskenton.com/table_of_contents/articles/rugolo/|archivedate=December 7, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:(Portrait of Stan Kenton, Pete Rugolo, and Bob Graettinger, Richmond, Va.(?), 1947 or 1948) (LOC) (5020406362).jpg|thumb|right|200px|(From left:) [[Pete Rugolo]], Stan Kenton, and Bob Graettinger in 1948.]] After a string of mostly arrangements, Rugolo turned out three originals that Kenton featured on the band's first album in 1946: (''Artistry in Rhythm''): "Artistry in Percussion", "Safranski" and "Artistry in Bolero". Added to this mix came "Machito", "Rhythm Incorporated", "Monotony" and "Interlude" in early 1947 (though some were not recorded until later in the year). These compositions, along with [[June Christy]]'s voice, came to define the ''Artistry in Rhythm'' band.   [[Afro-Cuban]] writing was added to the Kenton book with compositions like Rugolo's "Machito."

The ''Artistry in Rhythm'' ensemble was a formative band, with outstanding soloists. By early 1947, the Stan Kenton Orchestra had reached a high point of financial and popular success. They played in the best theaters and ballrooms in America and numerous hit records. Dances at the many ballrooms were typically four hours a night and theater dates generally involved playing mini concerts between each showing of the movie.  This was sometimes five or six a day, stretching from morning to late night. Most days not actually playing were spent in buses or cars. Days off from performing were rare. For Stan Kenton they just allowed for more record signing, radio station interviews, and advertising for [[Capitol Records]].  Due to the financial and personal demands, following an April performance in [[Tuscaloosa]], he broke up the ''Artistry in Rhythm'' incarnation of Kenton ensembles.

==== Progressive Jazz ====

After a hiatus of five months, Kenton reformed an ensemble with a new goal; he would present ''Concerts in Progressive Jazz''. This goal proved mostly obtainable but the band had to still fill in its schedule by booking dances and movie theater jobs, especially over the summer.

Pete Rugolo composed and arranged the great bulk of the new music, a music that Kenton declared to be ''Progressive Jazz.'' [[Bob Graettinger]] wrote twenty or so pieces for the band, including his ground-breaking opus ''[[City of Glass (Stan Kenton album)|City of Glass]].'' [[Ken Hanna]], who began the tour as a trumpet player, contributed a few compositions to the new band, including ''Tiare'' and ''Somnambulism''. Kenton contributed no new scores to the ''Progressive Jazz'' band, although several of his older works were performed on concerts, including ''Concerto to End All Concertos,'' ''Eager Beaver,'' ''Opus in Pastels,'' and ''Artistry in Rhythm.''

[[File:Stan Kenton and Pete Rugolo, 1947 or 1948 (William P. Gottlieb 04891).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Stan Kenton with Pete Rugolo, 1948]]

Cuban inflected titles from the ''Progressive Jazz'' period include Rugolo's ''Introduction to a Latin Rhythm,'' ''Cuban Carnival,'' ''[[The Peanut Vendor]]'', and ''Journey to Brazil,'' and [[Bob Graettinger]]'s ''Cuban Pastorale.'' The addition of a full-time bongo player and a Brazilian guitarist in the band enabled the writers to explore these Latin rhythms more deeply than before.

The ''Progressive Jazz'' period lasted 14 months, beginning on September 24, 1947, when the Stan Kenton Orchestra played a concert at the [[Rendezvous Ballroom]]. And it ended after the last show at the [[Paramount Theatre (New York City)|Paramount Theatre]] in New York City on December 14, 1948. The band produced only one album and a handful of singles, due to a recording ban by the American Federation of Musicians that lasted the entirety of 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthingskenton.com/table_of_contents/adventures/progressive-jazz/progressive-jazz-essay/|title=All Things Kenton – Progressive Jazz Essay|author=|date=|website=allthingskenton.com|accessdate=April 30, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207141122/http://allthingskenton.com/table_of_contents/adventures/progressive-jazz/progressive-jazz-essay/|archivedate=December 7, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many sidemen from the ''Artistry'' band returned, but there were significant changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthingskenton.com/table_of_contents/adventures/progressive-jazz/personnel/|title=All Things Kenton – Progressive Jazz Personnel|author=|date=|website=allthingskenton.com|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171219083730/http://allthingskenton.com/table_of_contents/adventures/progressive-jazz/personnel/|archivedate=19 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurindo Almeida]] on classical guitar, and [[Jack Costanzo]] on bongos dramatically changed the band's timbre. Both were firsts for the Kenton band, or any jazz band for that matter. The rhythm section included returnees [[Eddie Safranski]] (bass) and [[Shelly Manne]] (drums), both destined to win first place Down Beat awards.

Four of the five trumpet players returned: [[Buddy Childers]], [[Ray Wetzel]], [[Alfred "Chico" Alvarez|Chico Alvarez]], and [[Ken Hanna]]. [[Al Porcino]] was added to the already powerhouse section. [[Conte Candoli]] joined the band, replacing Porcino, in February 1948.

[[Kai Winding]], star trombonist of the ''Artistry in Rhythm'' band would not be a part of the ''Progressive Jazz'' era, except for a few dates on which he subbed. [[Milt Bernhart]] came in on lead trombone. And Bart Varsalona returned on bass trombone. Bernhart's first big solo with the Kenton band proved to be a major hit, ''[[The Peanut Vendor]].''

The saxophone section was much improved and modernized. Returning saxophonists included baritone Bob Gioga, holding down his chair since the very start, and [[Bob Cooper (musician)|Bob Cooper]] on tenor. With [[Vido Musso]]'s departure, Cooper and his modernist sound became the featured tenor soloist. [[Art Pepper]] came on as second alto, the "jazz" chair. And the new lead alto was [[George William Weidler|George Weidler]].

This was literally a band of all-stars. They received five first place awards in the Down Beat poll at the end of 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthingskenton.com/table_of_contents/adventures/progressive-jazz/poll-winners/|title=All Things Kenton – Progressive Jazz Down Beat Poll Winners|author=|date=|website=allthingskenton.com|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207140450/http://allthingskenton.com/table_of_contents/adventures/progressive-jazz/poll-winners/|archivedate=7 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and similar awards from the other magazines. The arrangers continued to push the limits of these superb instrumentalists in their compositions. Works from this period are more sophisticated than those written for the ''Artistry'' band, and are some of the first and most successful "[[third stream]]" compositions.

The band criss-crossed the country, appearing in the nation's top concert venues, including [[Carnegie Hall]], [[Boston Symphony Hall]], [[Chicago Civic Opera House]], [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)]], and the [[Hollywood Bowl]]. They had extended stays at New York's [[Paramount Theatre (New York City)|Paramount Theatre]] and Hotel Commodore, Philadelphia's Click, Detroit's Eastwood Gardens, Radio City Theater in Minneapolis, and the [[Rendezvous Ballroom]], a special place in Kenton's musical life.

Kenton's band was the first to present a concert in the famous outdoor arena, the Hollywood Bowl. His concert there on June 12, 1948 drew more than 15,000 people, and was both an artistic and commercial success. Kenton pocketed half of the box office, walking away with $13,000 for the evening's concert.&lt;ref&gt;"15,000 Pack Bowl to Dig Kenton Bash." ''Down Beat'' 15, no. 15 (July 28, 1948): 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The band broke attendance records all across the country. Thanks to Kenton's public relations acumen, he was able to convince concert goers and record buyers of the importance of his music. Comedy numbers and June Christy vocals helped break up the seriousness of the new music.

Kenton's successes did not sit well with everyone. In an essay entitled ''Economics and Race in Jazz'', Leslie B. Rout Jr. wrote that "the real scourge of the 1946-1949 period was the all-white Stan Kenton band. Dubbing his musical repertoire 'progressive jazz,' Kenton saw his orchestra become the first in jazz history to reach an annual gross of $1,000,000 in 1948." He contrasted this with a situation in which critical and public recognition of "[[Dizzy Gillespie]] as the premiere bopper could not be transformed into coin of the realm."&lt;ref&gt;Rout Jr, Leslie B. "Economics and Race in Jazz", in Ray Broadus Browne (ed.), ''Frontiers of American Culture'', 1968, 154-171.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 1948, as the band was fulfilling an extended engagement at the Paramount Theater in New York City, the leader notified his sidemen, his bookers, and the press, that he would be disbanding once more. Kenton's most artistically and commercially successful band ceased to be at the top of their game. On December 14, the Stan Kenton Orchestra played their last notes for over a year. When they returned, there would be new faces, new music and a string section.

===1950s===
After a year's hiatus, in 1950 Kenton finally put together the large 39-piece [[Innovations in Modern Music]] Orchestra that included 16 strings, a woodwind section, and two French horns.  The music was an extension of the works composed and recorded since 1947 in by [[Robert Graettinger|Bob Graettinger]], [[Manny Albam]], [[Franklyn Marks]] and others.  Name jazz musicians such as [[Maynard Ferguson]], [[Shorty Rogers]], [[Milt Bernhart]], [[John Graas]], [[Art Pepper]], [[Bud Shank]], [[Bob Cooper (musician)|Bob Cooper]], [[Laurindo Almeida]], [[Shelly Manne]], and [[June Christy]] were part of these musical ensembles.  The groups managed two tours during 1950–51, from a commercial standpoint it would be Stan Kenton's first major failure.  Kenton soon reverted to a more standard 19-piece lineup.&lt;ref name = SPARKE1/&gt;

In order to be more commercially viable, Kenton reformed the band in 1951 to a much more standard instrumentation: five saxes, five trombones, five trumpets, piano, guitar, bass, drums. The charts of such arrangers as [[Gerry Mulligan]], [[Johnny Richards]], and particularly [[Bill Holman (musician)|Bill Holman]] and [[Bill Russo]] began to dominate the repertoire. The music was written to better reflect the style of cutting edge, be-bop oriented big bands; like those of Dizzy Gillespie or Woody Herman.  Young, talented players and outstanding jazz soloists such as [[Maynard Ferguson]], [[Lee Konitz]], [[Conte Candoli]], [[Sal Salvador]], and [[Frank Rosolino]] made strong contributions to the level of the 1952–'53 band.  The music composed and arranged during this time was far more tailor made to contemporary jazz tastes; the 1953 album ''[[New Concepts of Artistry in Rhythm]]'' is noted as one of the high points in Kenton's career as band leader.  Though the band was to have a very strong "concert book", Kenton also made sure the dance book was made new, fresh and contemporary.  The album ''[[Sketches on Standards]]'' from 1953 is an excellent example of Kenton appealing to a wider audience while using the band and [[William Russo (musician)|Bill Russo]]'s arranging skills to their fullest potential.  Even though the personnel changed rather rapidly, Kenton's focus was very clear on where he would lead things musically.  By this time producer Lee Gillette worked well in concert with Kenton to create a balanced set of recordings that were both commercially viable and cutting edge musically.

Arguably the most "swinging" band Kenton was to field came when legendary drummer [[Mel Lewis]] joined the orchestra in 1954.  Kenton's ''[[Contemporary Concepts]]'' (1955) and ''[[Kenton in Hi-Fi]]'' (1956) albums during this time are very impressive as a be-bop recording and then a standard dance recording (respectively).&lt;ref name = SPARKE1/&gt;  ''[[Kenton in Hi-Fi]]''s wide popularity and sales benefited from the fact it was his greatest hits of ten years earlier re-recorded in stereo with a contemporary, much higher level band.  The album climbed all the way up to #22 on the Billboard album charts and provided much needed revenue at a time when [[Rock n Roll]] had started to become the dominant [[pop music]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name = SPARKE1/&gt;  It would become more and more difficult for Kenton to alternate between 'dance' and serious 'jazz' albums while staying financially solvent.

[[File:Cuban Fire! cover.jpg|Stan Kenton's ''Cuban Fire!'' album featured the music of composer Johnny Richards|thumb|left]]
One of the standout projects and recordings for the mid-1950s band is the ''[[Cuban Fire!]]'' album released in 1956.  Though Stan Kenton had recorded earlier hits such as ''[[The Peanut Vendor]]'' in 1947 with Latin percussionist [[Machito]], as well as many other Latin flavored singles, the ''Cuban Fire!'' suite and LP stands as a watershed set of compositions for [[Johnny Richards]]' career and an outstanding commercial/artistic achievement for the Kenton orchestra, and a singular landmark in large ensemble [[Latin jazz]] recordings.&lt;ref name=Lawn&gt;Lawn, Richard (2007). "Experiencing Jazz". McGraw-Hill, p. 442. {{ISBN|978-0-07-245179-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = SPARKE1/&gt;  "CUBAN FIRE is completely authentic, the way it combines big-band jazz with genuine Latin-American rhythms."&lt;ref name="Sparke" /&gt;  The success of the ''Cuban Fire!'' album can be gauged in part by the immediate ascent of Johnny Richards' star after its release; he was suddenly offered a contract by [[Bethlehem Records]] to record what would be the first of several recordings with his own groups.&lt;ref name = SPARKE1/&gt;

At one point, Kenton faced a controversy in 1956 with comments he made when the band returned from a European tour. The current Critics Poll in ''[[Down Beat]]'' was now dominated by African-American musicians in virtually every category. The Kenton band was playing in [[Ontario, Canada]] at the time, and Kenton dispatched a telegram which lamented "a new minority, white jazz musicians," and stated his "disgust [with the so-called] literary geniuses of jazz." Jazz critic [[Leonard Feather]] responded in the October 3, 1956, issue of ''[[Down Beat]]'' with an open letter that questioned Kenton's racial views. Feather implied that Kenton's failure to win the Critics Poll was probably the real reason for the complaint, and wondered if racial prejudice was involved.  In hindsight the record shows Kenton's biggest sin is to have hastily fired off the comments.  His racial views and relationships with Black or Hispanic musicians were quite good dating back to interaction with [[Charlie Parker]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Machito]] and [[Nat King Cole]] besides having band members such as [[Lucky Thompson]], [[Curtis Counce]], Ramon Lopez, Kevin Jordan, and [[Douglas Purviance]].

By the end of the decade Kenton was with the last incarnation of a 19-piece, '50s-style Kenton orchestra.  Many bands have been called a leader's "best"; this last Kenton 1959 incarnation of the 1950s bands may very well be the best. The group would pull off one of Kenton's most artistic, subtle and introspective recordings, ''[[Standards in Silhouette]].''  As trombonist Archie LeCoque recalled of this album of very slow ballads, "...it was hard, but at the time we were all young and straight-ahead, we got through it and (two) albums came out well."&lt;ref name= SPARKE1/&gt;  By 1959 [[Stereophonic sound]] recording was now being fully utilized with all major labels.  One of the great triumphs of the ''[[Standards in Silhouette]]'' album is the mature writing, the combination of the room used, a live group with very few overdubs, and the recording being in full stereo fidelity (and later remastered to digital).&lt;ref&gt;author of this page: 'I have over 1000 classical and jazz CDs and "Standards..." is a shining star.  I have heard very few recordings that are so enjoyable to listen to in terms of overall quality of sound, especially now on digital CD.'&lt;/ref&gt;  Bill Mathieu was highly skeptical of the decision to record his music like ''[[Cuban Fire!]]'' in a cavernous ballroom.  Mathieu adds: "Stan and producer Lee Gillette were absolutely right: the band sounds alive and awake (which is not easy when recording many hours of slow-tempo music in a studio), and most importantly, the players could hear themselves well in the live room. The end result is the band sounds strong and cohesive, and the album is well recorded."&lt;ref name=SPARKE2/&gt;  This is the last set of studio dates before Kenton would retool the entire orchestra in 1960.

===1960s===
[[File:Bill_Holman_and_Stan_Kenton.jpg|Stan Kenton with Bill Holman in December 1961 for the ''Adventures In Jazz'' recording sessions at Capitol Studios, Hollywood, California|thumb|right]]

The Kenton orchestra had been on a slow decline in sales and popularity in the late 1950s with having to compete with newer, popular music artists such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Bobby Darin]] and [[The Platters]].  The nadir of this decline was around 1958 and coincided with a recession that was effecting the entire country.&lt;ref name=SPARKE1/&gt; There were far fewer big bands on the road and live music venues were hard to book for the Kenton orchestra.  The band would end 1959 beaten up by poor attendance at concerts and having to rely far more on dance halls than real jazz concerts.&lt;ref name=SPARKE2/&gt;  The band would reform in 1960 with a new look and new sound, this was larger group with a '[[Mellophone#Mellophonium|mellophonium]]' section added and part of an upsurge in Kenton's popularity.&lt;ref name=SPARKE1/&gt;&lt;ref name="SPARKE2"&gt;Sparke, Michael; Peter Venudor (1998). ''Stan Kenton, The Studio Sessions''. Balboa Books. {{ISBN|0-936653-82-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mellophonium Description-xr.jpg|The Mellophonium was a featured instrument by Stan Kenton from 1960 through the end of 1963. Though intonation was problematic, it added a unique color to the sound palate of the orchestra.|thumb|left]]The new instrument was used by Kenton to "bridge the gap" in range, color, and tonality between his trumpet and trombone sections.  Essentially it creates a [[Bore (wind instruments)#Conical bore|conical]], midrange sound that is common in a [[Orchestra|symphonic setting]] with a [[French horn|horn]] ([[French horn]]) but the bell of the instrument faces forward.  Kenton's 1961 recording ''[[The Romantic Approach]]'' for [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] is the first of 11 LPs that would feature the "[[Mellophone#Mellophonium|mellophonium]] band".  Kenton arranged the whole first [[Mellophone#Mellophonium|mellophonium]] album himself and it was very well received in a September 1961 review in ''[[Down Beat]]''.&lt;ref name = "TYNAN"&gt;Tynan, John. review of ''The Romantic Approach'', September 28, 1961, ''Down Beat'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kenton Orchestra from 1960 to 1963 had numerous successes; the band had a relentless recording schedule.  The albums ''[[Kenton's West Side Story]]'' (arrangements by [[Johnny Richards]]) and ''[[Adventures In Jazz]]'', each won [[Grammy]] awards in 1962 and 1963 respectively. [[Ralph Carmichael]] wrote a superb set of Christmas charts for Kenton which translated into one of the most popular recordings from the band leader to date: ''[[A Merry Christmas!]].''   Also, Johnny Richards' ''[[Adventures in Time]]'' suite (recorded in 1962) was the culmination of all things the [[mellophonium]] band was capable of.&lt;ref name=SPARKE1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/ablogsupreme/2012/02/17/147040413/stan-kenton-at-100-artistry-in-rhythm NPR: Stan Kenton At 100: Artistry In Rhythm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018161925/http://www.npr.org/sections/ablogsupreme/2012/02/17/147040413/stan-kenton-at-100-artistry-in-rhythm |date=October 18, 2017 }}, Reference to Adventures in Time in article as important milestone of Kenton's music. February 17, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;   After the Fall 1963 U.S./U.K. tour ended in November, the [[mellophonium]] incarnation of Kenton bands was done.  The conditions of Stan’s divorce from jazz singer, Ann Richards was that a judge ordered Stan to take a year off the road to help raise their two children or lose custody all together. Kenton would not reform another road band for tour until 1965.

Kenton had ties from earlier writing of country/western songs that were a success with Capitol and again he tried his hand in that genre during the early 1960s.  In a music market that was becoming increasingly tight, in 1962 he cut the hit single "[[Mama Sang a Song]]"; his last Top-40 ({{abbr|No.|number}}&amp;nbsp;32 ''Billboard'', No.&amp;nbsp;22 Music Vendor).  The song was a narration written by country singer Bill Anderson and spoken by Kenton.  The single also received a Grammy nomination the following year in the Best Documentary or Spoken Word Recording category.  The other attempt he made into that market was the far less successful ''[[Stan Kenton! Tex Ritter!]]'', released in 1962 as a full LP.

After the breakup of the [[mellophonium]] band, ''[[Kenton / Wagner]]'' (1964) was an important recording project that Kenton arranged himself, again moving towards "progressive jazz" or [[third stream]] music.  This album was not a financial success but kept Kenton at the forefront of 'art music' interpretation in the commercial music world.  ''[[Stan Kenton Conducts the Los Angeles Neophonic Orchestra]]'' (1965) was an artistic success that garnered another Grammy nomination for the band leader.

The 1966 - 1969 [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] releases for Stan Kenton were a severe low point for his recording career. [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] producer Lee Gillette was trying to exploit the money making possibilities of numerous popular hits to include the 1968 musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' featuring contemporary [[rock n' roll|rock music]].&lt;ref name= SPARKE1/&gt;   Due to lack of promotion by [[Capitol Records|Capitol]], four LPs were financial failures; this would be the last releases for Kenton under the aegis of long time Kenton producer Lee Gillette and [[Capitol Records|Capitol]].&lt;ref name= SPARKE1/&gt;   In fact, by the time it was recorded Kenton had no involvement in the ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' [[LP record|LP]] except for Kenton's name placed on the jacket cover; [[Ralph Carmichael]] and [[Lennie Niehaus]] were placed in charge of the project.  Two exceptions to this late 1960s period are the Billboard charted single the band cut of the ''[[Dragnet (franchise)#1967–70 revival|Dragnet]]'' theme (1967) and another ''Kenton presents'' release featuring the music of composer and ex-bandsman [[Dee Barton]]: ''[[The Jazz Compositions of Dee Barton]]'' (1967).

===1970s===
[[File:Stan Kenton Big Band.JPG|thumb|left|Stan Kenton with his band in Münich, Germany, September 1973]]
The transition from [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] to Creative World Records in 1970 was fraught with difficulties during a time when the music business was changing rapidly. As a viable jazz artist who was trying to keep a loyal but dwindling following, Kenton turned to arrangers such as [[Hank Levy]] and [[Bob Curnow]] to write material that appealed to a younger audience.&lt;ref name= SPARKE1/&gt;  The first releases for the Creative World label were live concerts and Kenton had the control he wanted over content but lacked substantial resources to engineer, mix, and promote what Capitol underwrote in the past. Kenton would take a big gamble to bypass the current record industry and rely far more on the direct mail lists of jazz fans which the newly formed Creative World label would need to sell records.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, William F. (1980), "''Stan Kenton: Artistry in Rhythm'', Los Angeles: Creative Press, Los Angeles, p. 365. {{ISBN|089745-993-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kenton also made his print music available to college and high-school stage bands with several publishers.

[[File:Bob Curnow &amp; Stan Kenton, 1974 Universal Studios - Chicago album.jpg|thumb|Stan Kenton with Bob Curnow, Universal Studios in Chicago, 1974]]
Kenton continued leading and touring with his big band up to his final performance in August 1978.
In June 1973 [[Bob Curnow]] had started as the new artists and repertoire manager overseeing the whole operation of the Creative World Records.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, William F. (1980) "Stan Kenton: Artistry in Rhythm". Creative Press, Los Angeles. pp. 374 {{ISBN|089745-993-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was just the year before (in 1972) the Kenton orchestra recorded the ''National Anthems of the World'' double LP with 40 arrangements all done by Curnow.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, Carol (1973), "Straight Ahead: The Story of Stan Kenton". William Morrow &amp; Co. Inc., New York, p. 247 {{ISBN|0-688-00196-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As per Curnow himself, "That was a remarkable and very difficult time for me. I was managing (Stan's) record company with NO ex.rience in business, writing music like mad, living in a new place and culture ([[Los Angeles]] was another world), traveling a LOT (out with the band at least 1 week a month) and trying to keep it together at home."&lt;ref name=interviewsBob&gt;Email interview with [[Bob Curnow]], February 16, 2013, with Dr. Jack Cooper, Assoc. Professor. of Music, University of Memphis&lt;/ref&gt;

When Kenton took to the road during the early 1970s and up to his last tour, he took with him seasoned veteran musicians (John Worster, Willie Maiden, Warren Gale, Graham Ellis and others) teaming them with relatively unknown young artists, and new arrangements (including those by [[Hank Levy]], [[Bill Holman (musician)|Bill Holman]], [[Bob Curnow]], Willie Maiden and Ken Hanna) were used. Many alumni associated with Kenton from this era became educators (Mike Vax, John Von Ohlen, Chuck Carter, and Richard Torres), and a few went on to take their musical careers to the next level, such as [[Peter Erskine]] and [[Tim Hagans]].

===Legacy===
Kenton was a salient figure on the American musical scene and made an indelible mark on the arranged type of big band jazz. Kenton's music evolved with the times from 1940 through the 1970s. He was at the vanguard of promoting jazz and jazz improvisation through his service as an educator through his [[Stan Kenton Band Clinics]]. The "Kenton Style" continues to permeate big bands at the high school and collegiate level, and the framework he designed for the "[[Stan Kenton Band Clinics|jazz clinic]]" is still widely in use today.

Starting in the waning days of the big band era, Kenton found a multitude of ways in which to progress his art form. In his hands the size of the jazz orchestra expanded greatly, at times exceeding forty musicians. The frequency range (high and low notes) was also increased with the use of bass trombones and tuba, and baritone and bass saxophones. The dynamic range was pushed on both ends; the band could play softer and louder than any other big band. Kenton was the primary band leader responsible for moving the big band from the dance hall to the concert hall; one of the most important and successful players in the [[Third Stream]] movement.

Interest in his music has experienced somewhat of a resurgence, with critical "rediscovery" of his music and many reissues of his recordings. An alumni band named for him tours, led by lead trumpeter Mike Vax, which performs not only classic Kenton arrangements, but also new music written and performed by the band members (much like Kenton's own groups). Kenton donated his entire library to the music library of North Texas State University&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.unt.edu/music/special-collections/kenton |title=University of North Texas Libraries |publisher=Library.unt.edu |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702102133/http://www.library.unt.edu/music/special-collections/kenton/ |archivedate=July 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (now the [[University of North Texas]]), and the Stan Kenton Jazz Recital Hall is named in his honor. His arrangements are now published by Sierra Music Publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.Sierramusicstore.com/Stan_Kenton_Orchestra_s/52.htm |title=Stan Kenton Orchestra |publisher=Sierramusicstore.com |date= |accessdate=August 1, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610090111/http://www.sierramusicstore.com/Stan_Kenton_Orchestra_s/52.htm |archivedate=June 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When comparing the four longest running touring jazz orchestras (Kenton, [[Woody Herman|Herman]], [[Count Basie|Basie]], [[Duke Ellington|Ellington]]), Stan Kenton's band had a higher turnover of personnel. Bob Gioga, [[Buddy Childers]], and [[Dick Shearer]] all played for Kenton for over a decade. Other important soloists such as [[Lennie Niehaus]], [[Bill Perkins (saxophonist)|Bill Perkins]] and [[Alfred "Chico" Alvarez|Chico Alvarez]] had lengthy stays on the band as well. The list of noted jazz players, studio musicians is impressive and the consistency of the group from 1941 to Kenton's passing in 1979 is notable. Stan Kenton's leadership and music vision was clear to marshal the forces of such a [[Stan Kenton#Noted band personnel|diverse set of players and arrangers]] over this long period of time; Kenton stands alone in the respect.

==Personal life==
Kenton was born on December 15, 1911, according to his birth certificate, according to British biographer Michael Sparke.&lt;ref name=Sparke&gt;{{cite book|last=Sparke|first=Michael|title=Stan Kenton: This Is an Orchestra!|series=North Texas Lives of Musicians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r2CiSIXxpYIC&amp;&amp;pg=PA1|accessdate=February 14, 2014|year=2011|publisher=University of North Texas Press|location=Denton, Texas|isbn=978-1574413250|page=1|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenton had been conceived out of wedlock, and his parents told him that he was born two months later than his actual date of birth, February 19, 1912, to obscure this fact. Kenton believed well into adulthood that the February date was his birthday, and recorded the ''Birthday In Britain'' concert album on February 19, 1973.&lt;ref name=BirthdayInBritain/&gt;

The true date remained a closely held secret, and his grave marker shows the incorrect February 1912 birthdate.&lt;ref name=Sparke/&gt;

Kenton was married three times. Three children were produced from the first two marriages. His first marriage was to Violet Rhoda Peters in 1935, and it lasted for 15 years. The couple had a daughter in 1941, [[Leslie Kenton|Leslie]]. In her 2010 memoir, ''Love Affair'', Leslie Kenton wrote that, from 1952 to 1954, when she was between the ages of 11 and 13, her father sexually molested and raped her.&lt;ref name=LeslieBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Kenton|first=Leslie|title=Love Affair|year=2010|publisher=Vermilion (Ebury Publishing)|isbn=978-0312659080}}&lt;/ref&gt; She nonetheless maintained a close relationship with her father during his lifetime, though she states that she was emotionally scarred by the experience.&lt;ref name="Herring"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duerden"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolff|first=Carlo|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/book-reviews/2011/02/20/Stan-Kenton-s-daughter-opens-door-to-their-dark-past/stories/201102200247|title=Stan Kenton's daughter opens door to their dark past|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=February 20, 2011|accessdate=June 11, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504102821/http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/book-reviews/2011/02/20/Stan-Kenton-s-daughter-opens-door-to-their-dark-past/stories/201102200247|archivedate=May 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704030704576069714014660574|title=A Restless Soul Revealed|author=Will Friedwald|date=January 28, 2011|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=June 11, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804043622/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704030704576069714014660574|archivedate=August 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She stated that the rapes always occurred under the influence of alcohol, that he was not fully aware of his actions, and that 20 years later he apologized profusely for his previous behavior.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; Leslie was an author of several books about health, spirituality and beauty.&lt;ref name="Herring"&gt;{{cite web|last=Boleman-Herring|first=Elizabeth|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/elizabeth-bolemanherring/stan-kenton-his-daughter-_b_1286567.html|title=Stan Kenton &amp; His Daughter Leslie's 'Love Affair'|work=The Huffington Post|date=February 18, 2012|accessdate=December 21, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804171006/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/elizabeth-bolemanherring/stan-kenton-his-daughter-_b_1286567.html|archivedate=August 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duerden"&gt;{{cite web|last=Duerden|first=Nick|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/20/leslie-kenton-child-sexual-abuse|title=Leslie Kenton: 'I was angry, but never hated my father'|work=The Guardian|date=February 19, 2010|accessdate=December 21, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916150422/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/20/leslie-kenton-child-sexual-abuse|archivedate=September 16, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Stan Kenton married San Diego-born singer [[Ann Richards (singer)|Ann Richards]], who was 23 years his junior. The relationship produced two children: daughter Dana Lynn and son Lance. In 1961, Richards posed for a nude layout for ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine's June 1961 issue.&lt;ref&gt;''Playboy Magazine'', June 1961, [http://people-vs-drchilledair.blogspot.com/2008/05/no-biz-like-it.html Ann Richards photo layout] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106180552/http://people-vs-drchilledair.blogspot.com/2008/05/no-biz-like-it.html |date=November 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She signed a contract to record with [[Atco Records|Atco]], a company other than [[Capitol Records]] that her husband was unaware of.&lt;ref&gt;The LP cover photo of Ann Richards for the Atco Records release was a picture taken from the ''Playboy'' photo shoot, but edited&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Playboy'' shoot was done without Kenton's knowledge, and he only found out about it while playing at the [[Aragon Ballroom (Chicago)|Aragon Ballroom]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] when handed the magazine by Charles Suter, who was the editor of ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine at the time.&lt;ref name="HARRIS"&gt;Harris, Steven. ''The Kenton Kronicles.'' Dynaflow Publications. 2000. {{ISBN|0-9676273-0-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Richards was not typically on the road with the band, though she had recorded the album ''[[Two Much!]]'' with Kenton in 1960. Kenton filed for divorce in August 1961.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Kenton's third marriage was to Joann J. Hill, in 1967. This also ended in divorce, two years later.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In his later years he lived with his public relations secretary and last business manager Audree Coke Kenton, though they never formally married.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Kenton's heavy consumption of alcohol contributed to the physical difficulties he encountered during the last 10 years of his life.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite web|last=Singh|first=Anita|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/7106029/Jazz-great-Stan-Kenton-raped-his-daughter-she-claims-in-new-book.html|title=Jazz great Stan Kenton raped his daughter, she claims in new book|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=January 30, 2010|accessdate=June 10, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712085953/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/7106029/Jazz-great-Stan-Kenton-raped-his-daughter-she-claims-in-new-book.html|archivedate=July 12, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenton's son Lance became a member of the controversial [[Synanon]] new-age community in California, and served as one of its "Imperial Marines," a group entrusted with committing violence against former members and others considered enemies of the community. In 1978 he was arrested for helping to put a rattlesnake in the mailbox of an anti-Synanon lawyer, and he was sentenced to a year in prison.&lt;ref name=TimesObit&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0219.html|title=Stan Kenton, Band Leader, Dies; Was Center of Jazz Controversies|first=John S.|last= Wilson|date=August 27, 1979|work=The New York Times|accessdate=June 10, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063008/http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0219.html|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenton had two accidental falls, one in the early 1970s and then again in the autumn of 1977 while on tour in [[Reading, Pennsylvania]]. The second fall was very serious as he fractured his skull. The last two years of his life became far more physically challenging for Kenton from the effects of the two accidents.

On August 17, 1979, he was admitted to [[Olympia Medical Center|Midway Hospital]] near his home in Los Angeles after a stroke; he died eight days later, on August 25. At the time of his death he had three grandchildren. Kenton was interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery, Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=TimesObit/&gt;

==Compositions==

Stan Kenton's compositions include "Artistry in Rhythm", "Opus in Pastels", "Artistry Jumps", "Reed Rapture", "Eager Beaver", "Fantasy", "Southern Scandal", "Harlem Folk Dance", "Painted Rhythm", "Concerto to End All Concertos", "Easy Go", "Concerto for Doghouse", "Shelly Manne", "Balboa Bash", "Flamenco", and "Sunset Tower".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthingskenton.com/table_of_contents/arrangers/stan-kenton/|title=All Things Kenton — The Arrangers - Stan Kenton|author=|date=|website=All Things Kenton|accessdate=April 30, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207140619/http://allthingskenton.com/table_of_contents/arrangers/stan-kenton/|archivedate= December 7, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although several compositions are co-credited to Stan Kenton and Pete Rugolo, Rugolo was the primary composer, with Kenton oftentimes merely offering verbal suggestions. Compositions that were true collaborations include "Artistry in Boogie," "Collaboration," and "Theme to the West." Additionally, in spite of getting co-composer credit, Kenton's sole contribution to his hit song from 1944 "[[And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine]]" was that of being a band leader; [[Joe Greene (American songwriter)|Joe Greene]] wrote the lyrics, Charles Lawrence composed the melody and [[Bob Hope]]'s resident arranger, [[Buddy Baker (composer)|Buddy Baker]], supplied the arrangement.

The '''Sundanese''' ([[Sundanese language|Sundanese]]: '''{{Sund|ᮅᮛᮀ ᮞᮥᮔ᮪ᮓ}}''', '''Urang Sunda''') are an [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] [[ethnic group]] native to the western part of the [[Indonesia]]n island of [[Java]]. They number approximately 40 million, and form [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|Indonesia's second most populous ethnic group]], after the neighboring [[Javanese people|Javanese]]. In their language, [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], the Sundanese refer to themselves as  ''Urang Sunda'' ({{lang-su|Sunda people}}), while ''Orang Sunda'' or ''Suku Sunda'' is its [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] equivalent.

The Sundanese have traditionally been concentrated in the provinces of [[West Java]], [[Banten]], [[Jakarta]], and the western part of [[Central Java]]. Sundanese migrants can also be found in [[Lampung]] and [[South Sumatra]], and to lesser extent in [[Central Java]] and [[East Java]].

==Etymology==
The name ''Sunda'' derives from the [[Sanskrit]] [[prefix]] ''su''- which means "goodness" or "possessing good quality". The example is ''suvarna'' (lit:"good color") used to describe gold. ''Sunda'' is also another name for Hindu God [[Vishnu]]. In Sanskrit, the term ''Sundara'' (masculine) or ''Sundari'' (feminine) means "beautiful" or "excellence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| title       = Sunda in Sanskrit Dictionary

| publisher   = Sanskrit Dictionary
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Sunda'' also means bright, light, purity, cleanness and white.&lt;ref&gt;

==Origins and history==
===Migration theories===
[[File:Jaipongan Bunga Tanjung 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jaipongan]] Mojang Priangan, a Sundanese traditional dance performance.]]
The Sundanese are of [[Austronesian]] origins who are thought to have originated in [[Taiwan]], migrated though the Philippines, and reached Java between 1,500 BC and 1,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2003), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there is also a hypothesis that argues that the Austronesian ancestors of contemporary Sundanese people originally came from [[Sundaland]], a sunken massive peninsula that today forms the Java Sea, the Malacca and Sunda straits, and the islands between them.&lt;ref name="Oppenheimer1998"&gt;{{cite book | title=Eden in the east: the drowned continent| last=Oppenheimer| first=Stephen | authorlink=Stephen Oppenheimer| year=1998| publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson| location=London | isbn=0-297-81816-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to recent genetic study, Sundanese, together with Javanese and Balinese has almost equal ratio of genetic marker shared between [[Austronesian]] and [[Austroasiatic]] heritages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pemetaan Genetika Manusia Indonesia | work = Kompas.com | url = http://assets.kompas.com/data/photo/2015/10/12/1113035menyusuri-jejak-leluhur780x390.JPG | language = Indonesian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin myth===
The ''[[Sunda Wiwitan]]'' belief contains the mythical origin of Sundanese people; Sang Hyang Kersa, the supreme divine being in ancient Sundanese belief created seven bataras (deities) in Sasaka Pusaka Buana (The Sacred Place on Earth). The oldest of these bataras is called Batara Cikal and is considered the ancestor of the Kanekes people. Other six bataras ruled various locations in Sunda lands in Western Java. A Sundanese legend of [[Sangkuriang]] contain the memory of the prehistoric [[Lake Bandung|ancient lake in Bandung basin]] highland, which suggest that Sundanese already inhabit the region since [[Mesolithic]] era, at least 20,000 years ago. Another popular Sundanese proverb and legend mentioned about the creation of [[Parahyangan]] (Priangan) highlands, the heartland of Sundanese realm; "When the [[hyang]]s (gods) were smiling, the land of Parahyangan was created". This legend suggested the Parahyangan highland as the playland or the abode of gods, as well as suggesting its natural beauty.

===Hindu-Buddhist Kingdoms era===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Beschreven steen in Batoetoelis de batu tulis TMnr 60016704.jpg|thumb|right|[[Batutulis inscription]] in [[Bogor]], describes the deeds of Sunda King, [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]], popularly known as Prabu Siliwangi.]]
The earliest historical polity which appeared in the Sundanese realm in the Western part of Java was the kingdom of [[Tarumanagara]], which flourished between the 4th and 7th century. [[Hindu]] influences reached the Sundanese people as early as the 4th century CE as is evident in [[Tugu inscription|Tarumanagara inscriptions]]. The adoption of this dharmic faith in Sundanese way of life was, however, never as intense as their Javanese counterparts. It seems that despite the central court beginning to adopt Hindu-Buddhist culture and institution, the majority of common Sundanese still retained their native natural and ancestral worship. By the 4th century, the older megalithic culture was probably still alive and well next to the penetrating Hindu influences. Court cultures flourished in ancient times, for example, during the era of [[Sunda Kingdom]], however the Sundanese appear not to have had the resources nor desire to construct large [[Candi of Indonesia|religious monuments]] similar to those built by [[Javanese people|Javanese]] in Central and East Java.&lt;ref name="Hefner 1997"&gt;Hefner (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional rural Sundanese method of rice farming, by ''ladang'' or ''huma'' (dry rice farming), in contrast to Javanese irrigated ''sawah'' wet rice cultivation (that require complex administration, coordination, and a lot of labor forces), also contributed to small populations of sparsely inhabited Sundanese villages.

Geographic constraints that isolate each region also led Sundanese villages to enjoy their simple way of life and their independence even more. That was probably the factor that would contribute to the carefree nature, egalitarian, conservative, independent and somewhat individualistic social outlook of Sundanese people. The Sundanese seem to love and revere their nature in spiritual ways, leading to them adopting some taboos in order to conserve the nature and maintain the ecosystem. The conservative tendency and their somewhat opposition to foreign influences, is demonstrated in extreme isolationist measures adopted keenly by Kanekes or [[Baduy people|Baduy]] people. They have rules against interacting with outsiders and adopting foreign ideas, technology, and ways of life. They have also set some taboos, such as not cutting trees nor harming forest creatures, in order to conserve their natural ecosystem.

One of the earliest historical records that mentions the name "Sunda" appears in the [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]] dated 952 saka (1030 CE) discovered in Cibadak, near [[Sukabumi]]. In 1225, a Chinese writer named [[Chou Ju-kua]], in his book ''[[Chu-fan-chi]]'', describes the port of ''Sin-t'o'' ([[Sunda Kingdom|Sunda]]), which probably refers to the port of [[Bantam (city)|Banten]] or [[Sunda Kelapa|Kalapa]]. By examining these records, it seems that the name "Sunda" started to appear in the early 11th century as a Javanese term used to designate their western neighbours. A Chinese source more specifically refers to it as the port of Banten or Sunda Kelapa. After the formation and consolidation of the [[Sunda Kingdom]]'s unity and identity during the [[Pajajaran]] era under the rule of [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]] (popularly known as [[King Siliwangi]]), the shared common identity of Sundanese people was more firmly established. They adopted the name "Sunda" to identify their kingdom, their people and their [[Sundanese language|language]].

===Under Dutch rule===

Inland Pasundan is mountainous and hilly, and until the 19th century, was thickly forested and sparsely populated. The Sundanese traditionally live in small and isolated hamlets, rendering control by indigenous courts difficult. The Sundanese, in contrast to the Javanese, traditionally engage in dry-field farming. These factors resulted in the Sundanese having a less rigid social hierarchy and more independent social manners.&lt;ref name="Hefner 1997"/&gt; In the 19th century, Dutch colonial exploitation opened much of the interior for coffee, tea, and quinine production, and the highland society took on a frontier aspect, further strengthening the individualistic Sundanese mindset.&lt;ref name="Hefner 1997"/&gt;

===Contemporary era===
There is popular belief among Indonesian ethnicities that Sundanese are famous for their beauty, in his report "Summa Oriental" on early 16th century [[Sunda Kingdom]], [[Tomé Pires]] mentioned: "The (Sundanese) women are beautiful, and those of the nobles chaste, which is not the case with those of the lower classes". It was said that Sundanese women are — in estimation of Indonesians — one of the most beautiful in the country. In Indonesian popular beliefs, it was said that because of the climate, they have lighter complexion than other Indonesians, and because the Sundanese diet features raw vegetables, they reputedly possess especially soft skin. Bandungite ladies, popularly known as ''Mojang [[Priangan]]'' are reputedly pretty, fashion smart and forward looking.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Probably because of this, many Sundanese people today pursue careers in the Indonesian entertainment industry.

Sundanese is also closely related to [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Minangkabau language|Minang]] as it is to Javanese, as seen by the Sundanese utilising different language levels denoting rank and respect – a concept borrowed from the Javanese.&lt;ref name="Hefner 1997"/&gt; Sundanese shares similar vocabularies with Javanese and Malay. There are several dialects of Sundanese, from the Sunda–Banten dialect to the Sunda–Central Javanese dialect which mixes elements of Javanese. Some of the most distinct dialects are from Banten, Bogor, Priangan, and Cirebon. In Central Java, Sundanese is spoken in some of the Cilacap region and some of the Brebes region. It is known that the most refined Sundanese dialect — which is considered as its original form  –  are those spoken in Ciamis, Tasikmalaya, Garut, Bandung, Sumedang, Sukabumi, and especially Cianjur (The dialect spoken by people living in Cianjur is considered as the most refined Sundanese). While Sundanese spoken on north coast, Banten and Cirebon is considered less refined. While the language spoken by the people of [[Baduy people|Baduy]] is considered the archaic type of Sundanese language,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balitouring.com/culture/sunda.htm The Sundanese]&lt;/ref&gt; before the Sundanese people adopt the concept of language stratification to denote rank and respect as demonstrated (and influenced) by [[Javanese language|Javanese]].

Today, the Sundanese language are mostly written in [[Latin script]]. An example of Sundanese-language media is Mangle Magazine that is written in Latin script. However, there is an effort to revive the [[Sundanese script]] which was used between the 14th and 18th centuries. For example, street names in Bandung and several cities in West Java are now written in both Latin and Sundanese scripts.

==Religion==

{{Religion at Java}}
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Sundanese bruiloft in een moskee TMnr 20017927.jpg|thumb|right|''Akad nikah'', Sundanese Islamic wedding vows in front of ''penghulu'' and witnesses.]]
The initial religious systems of the Sundanese were [[animism]] and [[Dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]] with reverence to ancestral (''karuhun'') and natural spirits identified as ''[[hyang]]'', yet bears some traits of [[pantheism]]. The best indications are found in the oldest epic poems (''wawacan'') and among the remote [[Baduy people|Baduy]] tribe. This religion is called ''[[Sunda Wiwitan]]'' ("early Sundanese").&lt;ref&gt;Dadan Wildan, Perjumpaan Islam dengan Tradisi Sunda,  Pikiran Rakyat, 26 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The [[rice]] agriculture had shaped the culture, beliefs and ritual system of traditional Sundanese people, among other the reverence to [[Dewi Sri|Nyai Pohaci Sanghyang Asri]] as the goddess of rice and fertility. The land of Sundanese people in Western Java is among the earliest place in Indonesian archipelago that being exposed to Indian Hindu-Buddhist influences. [[Tarumanagara]] followed by [[Sunda Kingdom]] adopted [[Hinduism]] as early as the 4th century. The [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]] [[stupa]] complex in Karawang shows Buddhist influences in West Java, while [[Cangkuang]] Shivaic temple near [[Garut]] shows Hindu influence. The 16th century sacred text [[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian]] contain the religious and moral rules, guidance, prescriptions and lessons for ancient Sundanese people.

Around the 15th to 16th centuries [[Islam]] began to spread among the Sundanese people by Indian Muslim traders, and its adoption accelerated after the fall of the Hindu Sunda Kingdom and the establishment of the Islamic Sultanates of [[Banten Sultanate|Banten]] and [[Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon]] in coastal West Java. Numerous [[ulama]] (locally known as "[[kyai]]") penetrated villages in the mountainous regions of [[Parahyangan]] and established mosques and schools ([[pesantren]]) and spread the Islamic faith amongst the Sundanese people. Small traditional Sundanese communities retained their indigenous social and belief systems, adopting self-imposed isolation, and refused foreign influences, proselytism and [[modernization]] altogether, such as those of the [[Baduy people|Baduy]] (Kanekes) people of inland [[Lebak Regency]]. Some Sundanese villages such as those in Cigugur Kuningan retained their [[Sunda Wiwitan]] beliefs, while some villages such as [[Kampung Naga]] in Tasikmalaya, and Sindang Barang Pasir Eurih in Bogor, although identifying themselves as Muslim, still uphold pre-Islamic traditions and taboos and venerated the ''karuhun'' (ancestral spirits). Today, most Sundanese are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Muslims.

After Western Java fell under [[Dutch East India Company]] control in the early 18th century, and later under colonial [[Dutch East Indies]] control,  [[Christian]] evangelism towards the Sundanese people was started by missionaries of Genootschap voor In- en Uitwendige Zending te Batavia (GIUZ). This organization was founded by Mr. F. L. Anthing and Pastor E. W. King in 1851. However, it was Nederlandsche Zendelings Vereeniging (NZV) which sent their missionaries to convert the Sundanese peoples. They started the mission in Batavia, later expanding into several towns in [[West Java]] such as [[Bandung]], [[Cianjur]], [[Cirebon]], [[Bogor]] and [[Sukabumi]]. They built schools, churches and hospitals for native people in West Java. Compared to the large Sundanese Muslim population, the numbers of Christian Sundanese are scarce; today Christians in West Java are mostly [[Chinese Indonesian]] residing in West Java, with only small numbers of native Sundanese Christians.

In contemporary Sundanese social and religious life, there is a growing shift towards [[Islamism]], especially amongst urban Sundanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digilib.uin-suka.ac.id/9787/1/JAJANG%20A.%20ROHMANA%20SUNDANESE%20SUFI%20LITERATURE%20AND%20LOCAL%20ISLAMIC%20IDENTITY%20A%20Contribution%20of%20%20Haji%20Hasan%20Mustapa%E2%80%99s%20Dangding.pdf |author=Jajang A.

The same phenomena was also found earlier in the [[Ethnic Malays|Malay community]] in Sumatra and Malaysia. Indeed, modern history saw the rise of political Islam through the birth of [[Darul Islam (Indonesia)|Darul Islam Indonesia]] in Tasikmalaya, West Java, back in 1949, although later this Islamist movement was cracked down upon by the [[Republic of Indonesia|Indonesian Republic]]. In modern contemporary political landscapes, the Sundanese realm in West Java and Banten also provides popular support for Islamic parties such as [[Partai Keadilan Sejahtera]] and [[Partai Persatuan Pembangunan]]. There are numbers of Sundanese ulama and Islamic preachers who have been quite successful in gaining national popularity, such as Kyai [[Abdullah Gymnastiar]] and Mamah Dedeh who have become TV personalities through their ''dakwah'' show. There are an increasing number of Sundanese people who are consider the [[Hajj]] (pilgrimage to Mecca) as something that enjoys social prestige. On the other side, there is also a growing movement led by the minority Sundanese conservative traditionalist ''adat'', the ''[[Sunda Wiwitan]]'' community, who are struggling to achieve wider acceptance and recognition of their faith and way of life.

==Culture==

===Family and social relations===
[[File:Sundanese Grandma.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Elderly Sundanese woman near a rice paddy, at [[Garut]], [[West Java]].]]
Sundanese culture has borrowed much from Javanese culture, however it differs by a much less rigid system of social hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Hefner 1997"/&gt; The Sundanese, in their mentality and behavior, their greater egalitarianism and antipathy to yawning class distinctions, and their community-based material culture, differ from the feudal hierarchy apparent among the people of Javanese principalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Minahan|title=Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific: An Encyclopedia|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=159-8846-59-0|page=305-306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central Javanese court culture nurtured in atmosphere conducive to elite, stylized, impeccably-polished forms of art and literature. In a pure sense, Sundanese culture bore few traces of these traditions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Alit Djajasoebrata, Bloemen van net Heelal: De kleurrijke Wereld van de Textiel op Java, A. W. Sijthoffs Uitgeversmaatschappij bv, Amsterdam, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

Culturally Sundanese people adopt a [[Bilateral descent|bilateral kinship system]], with male and female descent are of equal importance. In Sundanese families the important rituals revolved around life cycles, from birth to death, adopting many of the previous Animist and Hindu-Buddhist, as well as Islamic traditions. For example, during the seventh month of pregnancy there is a prenatal ritual called ''Nujuh Bulanan'' (identical to [[Naloni Mitoni]] in Javanese tradition) which traces its origins to Hindu ritual. Shortly after the birth of a baby, a ritual called ''Akekahan'' (from Arabic word: [[Aqiqah]]) is performed; an Islamic tradition in which the parents slaughter a goat for a baby girl or two goats for a baby boy, the meat later being cooked and distributed to relatives and neighbours. The [[circumcision]] ceremony is performed on pre-pubescent boys and celebrated with Sisingaan (lion) dance.

The wedding ceremony is the highlight of Sundanese family celebration involving complex rituals from ''naroskeun'' and ''neundeun omong'' (marriage proposal and agreement conducted by parents and family elders), ''siraman'' (bridal shower), ''seserahan'' (presenting wedding gifts for the bride), ''akad nikah'' (wedding vows), ''saweran'' (throwing coins, mixed with flower petals and sometimes also candies, for the unmarried guests to collect and believed to bring better luck in romance), ''huap lingkung'' (bride and groom feed each other by hand, with arms entwined to symbolize love and affection), ''bakakak hayam'' (bride and groom ripping a grilled chicken through holding each of its leg; a traditional way to determine which one will dominate the family which is the one that get the larger or head part), and the wedding feast inviting whole family and business relatives, neighbours, and friends as guests. The death in a Sundanese family usually performed through a series of rituals in accordance with traditional Islam, such as the ''pengajian'' (reciting Al Quran) including providing ''berkat'' (rice box with side dishes) for guests. The Quran recitation is performed daily, from the day of death through the seventh day following; later performed again on the 40th day, a year, and 1,000th days after the death. However today this tradition is not always closely and faithfully followed since growing numbers of Sundanese are adopting a less traditional Islam which does not maintain many of the older traditions.

===Artforms===

[[File:Wayang Golek Sunda PRJ 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wayang Golek]], traditional Sundanese puppetry.]]
Sundanese literature was basically oral; their arts (architecture, music, dance, textiles, ceremonies, etc.) substantially preserved traditions from an earlier phase of civilization, stretching back even to the Neolithic, and never overwhelmed (as eastward, in Java) by aristocratic Hindu-Buddhist ideas.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The art and culture of Sundanese people reflect historical influences by various cultures that include pre-historic native [[animism]] and [[shamanism]] traditions, ancient [[Hindu]]-[[Buddhist]] heritage, and [[Islamic culture]]. The Sundanese have very vivid, orally-transmitted memories of the grand era of the [[Sunda Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The oral tradition of Sundanese people is called [[Pantun Sunda]]: the chant of poetic verses employed for story-telling. It is the counterpart of Javanese ''tembang'', similar to but independent from Malay [[pantun]]. The Pantun Sunda often recount Sundanese folklore and legends such as [[Sangkuriang]], [[Lutung Kasarung]], [[Ciung Wanara]], [[Mundinglaya Dikusumah]], the tales of [[King Siliwangi]], and popular children's folk stories such as [[Leungli|Si Leungli]].

Traditional Sundanese arts include various forms of music, dance, and martial arts. The most notable types of Sundanese music are [[angklung]] bamboo music, [[kecapi suling]] music, [[gamelan degung]], reyog Sunda and rampak gendang. The Angklung bamboo musical instrument is considered one of the world heritages of intangible culture.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; a traditional social dance which is usually, but mistakenly, associated with [[eroticism]]. Other popular dances such as Merak dance describe colorful dancing peafowls. Sisingaan dance is performed especially in the [[Subang Regency|Subang]] area to celebrate the [[circumcision]] ritual where the boy to be circumcised is seated upon a lion figure carried by four men. Other dances such as the Peafowl dance, Dewi dance and Ratu Graeni dance shows Javanese [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]] courtly influences.

[[Wayang golek]] puppetry is the most popular wayang performance for Sundanese people. Many forms of ''[[kejawen]]'' dance, literature, [[gamelan]] music and [[shadow puppetry]] (''[[wayang kulit]]'') derive from the Javanese.&lt;ref name="Hefner 1997"/&gt; Sundanese puppetry is more influenced by Islamic folklore than the influence of Indian epics present in Javanese versions.&lt;ref name="Hefner 1997"/&gt;

The [[Pencak silat]] martial art in Sundanese tradition can be traced to the historical figure [[King Siliwangi]] of Sunda Pajajaran kingdom, with Cimande is one of the most prominent school. The recently developed [[Tarung Derajat]] is also a popular martial art in West Java. [[Kujang (weapon)|Kujang]] is the traditional weapon of the Sundanese people.

The architecture of a Sundanese house is characterized by its functionality, simplicity, modesty, uniformity with a little details, its use of natural [[Thatching|thatched]] materials, and its quite faithful adherence to the harmony with the nature and environment.&lt;ref name="AW-The Sundanese House"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2007/0307/culture_1-1.html|title=ArchitectureWeek - Culture - The Sundanese House - 2007.0307|first=Gabriella |last=Mihályi|website=www.architectureweek.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sundanese traditional houses mostly take basic form of [[gable roof]]ed structure, commonly called ''kampung'' style roof, made of thatched materials (''ijuk'' black ''[[Arenga pinnata|aren]]'' fibers, ''kirai'', ''hateup'' leaves or palm leaves) covering wooden frames and beams, woven [[bamboo]] walls, and its structure is built on short [[Stilt house|stilt]]s. Its roof variations might includes [[Hip roof|hip]] and [[gablet roof]] (combination of gable and hip roof).

The more elaborate overhanging gablet roof is called ''Julang Ngapak'', which means "bird spreading wings". Other traditional Sundanese house forms including ''Buka Pongpok, Capit Gunting, Jubleg Nangkub, Badak Heuay, Tagog Anjing'', and ''Perahu Kemureb''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://budaya-indonesia.org/Julang-Ngapak-Filosofi-Sebuah-Bangunan|title=Julang Ngapak, Filosofi Sebuah Bangunan|last=Nurrohman|first=Muhammad Arif|date=11 February 2015|website=Budaya Indonesia|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sundanese cuisine]] is one of the most popular traditional food in Indonesia, and it is also easily found in most Indonesian cities. The Sundanese food is characterized by its freshness; the famous ''[[lalab]]'' (raw vegetables salad) eaten with ''[[sambal]]'' (chilly paste) and also ''[[karedok]]'' (peanuts paste) demonstrate the Sundanese fondness for fresh raw vegetables. Similar to other ethnic groups in Indonesia, Sundanese people eat [[rice]] for almost every meal. The Sundanese like to say, "If you have not eaten rice, then you have not eaten at all." Rice is prepared in hundreds of different ways. However, it is simple steamed rice that serves as the centerpiece of all meals.

Next to [[steamed rice]], the side dishes of [[vegetables]], [[fish]], or [[meat]] are added to provide variety of taste as well as for protein, mineral and nutrient intake. These side dishes are grilled, fried, steamed or boiled and spiced with any combination of garlic, [[galangal]] (a plant of the ginger family), turmeric, coriander, ginger, and lemon grass. The herb rich food wrapped and cooked inside banana leaf called ''[[pepes]]'' (Sundanese:''pais'') is popular among Sundanese people. ''Pepes'' are available in many varieties according to its ingredients; carp fish, anchovies, minced meat with eggs, mushroom, tofu or oncom. ''[[Oncom]]'' is a popular foodstuff within Sundanese cuisine, just like its counterpart, tempe, is popular among Javanese people. Usually the food itself is not too spicy, but it is served with a very hot sauce made by grinding chili peppers and garlic together. On the coast, saltwater fish are common; in the mountains, fish tend to be either pond-raised carp or goldfish. A well-known Sundanese dish is lalapan, which consists only of raw vegetables, such as [[papaya]] leaves, [[cucumber]], [[eggplant]], and [[bitter melon]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Occupations===
[[File:Leuit os 080815-2283 srna.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A Sundanese ''Leuit'' (rice barn), initially Sundanese are rice farmers.]]
The traditional occupation of Sundanese people is [[agricultural]], especially [[rice]] cultivation. Sundanese culture and tradition are usually centred around the agricultural cycle. Festivities such as the ''[[Seren Taun]]'' harvest ceremony are held in high importance, especially in the traditional Sundanese community in Cipta Gelar village, Cisolok, [[Sukabumi]]; Sindang Barang, Pasir Eurih village, Taman Sari, [[Bogor]]; and the traditional Sundanese community in Cigugur [[Kuningan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.kompas.com/read/2011/01/23/09340353/Hari.Ini.Puncak.Seren.Taun.di.Bogor Seren Taun Bogor]&lt;/ref&gt; The typical Sundanese ''leuit'' (rice barn) is an important part of traditional Sundanese villages; it is held in high esteem as the symbol of wealth and welfare. Since early times, Sundanese have predominantly been farmers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; They tend to be reluctant to be government officers or legislators.&lt;ref&gt;Ajip Rosidi, Pikiran Rakyat, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Next to agriculture, Sundanese people often choose business and trade to make a living although mostly are traditional entrepreneurships, such as a travelling food or drink vendors, establishing modest ''[[warung]]'' (food stall) or restaurant, as the vendor of daily consumer's goods or open a modest [[barber|barber shop]]. Their affinity for establishing and running small-scale entrepreneurship is most likely contributed by Sundanese tendency to be independent, carefree, egalitarian, individualistic and  optimistic. They seem to abhor the rigid structure and rule of government offices. Several traditional traveling food vendors and food stalls such as ''[[Siomay]], [[Gado-gado]]'' and ''[[Karedok]], [[Nasi Goreng]], [[Cendol]], [[Congee|Bubur Ayam]], Roti Bakar'' (grilled bread), ''[[Bubur kacang hijau]]'' (green beans congee) and [[Indomie]] instant noodle stall are notably run by Sundanese.

Nevertheless, there are numbers of Sundanese that successfully carved their career as intellectuals or politicians in national politics, government offices and military positions. Some notable Sundanese has gained positions in Indonesian government as governor, municipal major, vice president and state ministers, also as officers and general in Indonesian military.

Sundanese also popularly known as cheerful and mercurial folks, as they love to joke and tease around. The [[wayang golek]] artform of [[Cepot]], Dawala, and Gareng punakawan character clearly demonstrate Sundanese quirky side. Some Sundanese might find art and culture as their passion and become artists, either fine art, musics or performing art. Today, there are a number of Sundanese involved in the music and entertainment industry, with some of Indonesia's most famous singers, musicians, composers, cinema directors, film and [[Sinetron]]s actors being of Sundanese origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rosidi | first = Ayip | publisher= | title =Revitalisasi dan Aplikasi Nilai-nilai Budaya Sunda dalam Pembangunan Daerah | url = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Topos_V_-_001.jpg|thumb|333x333px|Eduardo Chillida's ''Topos V.'']]
'''''Topos V''''', or simply '''''Topos''''', is a sculpture by the Basque artist [[Eduardo Chillida]], standing at [[Plaça del Rei]] in the [[Gothic Quarter, Barcelona|Gothic Quarter]] of [[Barcelona]].

Purchased by Barcelona municipality when it was exhibited at [[Fundació Joan Miró|Joan Miró Foundation]] in 1986, the artist itself suggested that the best placement for this sculpture would be Plaça del Rei, where its geometrical shapes, scale, brown color and textures could dialogue with the sober mediaeval architecture surrounding the square, including historical buildings such as [[Palau Reial Major|Palau Real Major]], the Royal [[Chapel of Santa Àgata|chapel of Saint Agatha]] and [[Padellàs's House]].

''Topos V'' is cast in iron. Its geometrical shape reproduces a [[Dihedral angle]], closed on two of its sides. The two open sides face the square. In addition, some round shaped forms that could evoke the B, for "Barcelona", and medieval arches or windows as well, complete the elements allowing a perfect complementarity between contemporary sculpture and medieval architecture.

Its dimensions are 2.10 × 2.37 × 1.70 metres.

'''Victor Moritz Goldschmidt''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Foreign Member of the Royal Society|ForMemRS]]}} (January 27, 1888 in [[Zürich]] – March 20, 1947 in [[Oslo]]) was a Norwegian [[Mineralogy|mineralogist]] considered (together with [[Vladimir Vernadsky]]) to be the founder of modern [[geochemistry]] and crystal chemistry, developer of the [[Goldschmidt Classification]] of elements.

==Early life and education==

They named him Viktor after a colleague of Heinrich, [[Victor Meyer]]. His father's family was pure Jewish back to at least 1600 and mostly highly educated, with rabbis, judges, lawyers and military officers among their numbers.&lt;ref name=Mason&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mason |first1=Brian |title=Victor Moritz Goldschmidt : father of modern geochemistry |date=1992 |publisher=Geochemical Society |isbn=0-941809-03-X |url=https://www.geochemsoc.org/publications/sps/v4vmgoldschmidt |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his father's career progressed, the family moved first to [[Amsterdam]] in 1893, to [[Heidelberg]] in 1896, and finally to Kristiania (later [[Oslo]]), Norway in 1901, where he took over the physical chemistry chair at the university.

Goldschmidt entered the University of Kristiana (later the [[University of Oslo]]) in 1906 and studied [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] and [[physical chemistry]], [[geology]], [[mineralogy]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[zoology]] and [[botany]].&lt;ref name=Kauffman/&gt; He secured a fellowship for his doctoral studies from the university at the age of 21 (1909). He worked on his thesis with the noted geologist [[Waldemar Christofer Brøgger (geologist)|Waldemar Christofer Brøgger]] and obtained his Norwegian doctor’s degree when he was 23 years old (1911). For his dissertation titled ''Die Kontaktmetamorphose im Kristianiagebiet'' ("The Contact Metamorphism in the Kristiania Region"), the Norwegian Academy of Sciences awarded him the Fridtjof Nansen award in 1912. The same year he was made Docent (Associate Professor) of [[Mineralogy]] and [[Petrography]] at the university.&lt;ref name=Kauffman/&gt;

==Career==

In 1914 Goldschmidt applied for a professorship in [[Stockholm]] and was offered the position. To entice him to stay, the University of Kristiania persuaded the government to establish a Mineralogical Institute with a professorship for him.&lt;ref name=Mason/&gt;{{rp|19}} In 1929 Goldschmidt was appointed the chair of [[mineralogy]] in [[Göttingen]], and he hired [[Reinhold Mannkopff]] and [[Fritz Laves]] as his assistants.&lt;ref name=Mason/&gt;{{rp|54,58}} However, after the rise of the Nazis to power, he became unhappy with the treatment of non-Aryans like himself (although the university treated him well) and he resigned in 1935 and returned to Oslo.&lt;ref name=GlasbyBritain/&gt;{{rp|21}}

On 9 April 1940, the Germans invaded Norway. On October 26, 1942, Goldschmidt was arrested at the orders of the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|German occupying powers]] as part of the [[Holocaust in Norway|persecution of Jews in Norway]] during World War II. Taken to the [[Berg concentration camp]], he became seriously ill and after a stay in a hospital near Oslo, he was released on 8 November, only to be rearrested on 25 November. However, as he was on the pier and about to be [[Jewish deportees from Norway during World War II|deported]] to [[Auschwitz]], he was freed because some colleagues had persuaded the chief of police that his scientific expertise was essential to the state.&lt;ref name=GlasbyBritain/&gt;{{rp|22}} Goldschmidt soon fled to [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name=GlasbyBritain/&gt;{{rp|23}}

Goldschmidt was flown to England on March 3, 1943 by a British intelligence unit, and provided information about technical developments in Norway. After a short period of uncertainty about his future status, he was assigned to the [[Macaulay Institute for Soil Research]] (in Aberdeen) of the [[Agricultural Research Council]]. He participated in discussions about the German use of raw materials and production of heavy water. He attended open meetings in Cambridge, Manchester, Sheffield, Edinburgh and Aberdeen and lectured at the [[British Coal Utilisation Research Association]] on the presence of rare elements in [[coal ash]].&lt;ref name=GlasbyGeosci&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/Geoscientist/Archive/March-2007/Goldschmidt-in-Britain |title=Goldschmidt in Britain|last=Glasby|first=Geoff |date=March 2007 |work=[[Geoscientist (magazine)|Geoscientist]] |volume=17 |number=3|publisher=[[Geological Society]]|accessdate=12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GlasbyBritain&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Glasby |first1=G.

Goldschmidt moved from Aberdeen to [[Rothamsted Experimental Station|Rothamsted]], where he was popular and nicknamed ‘Goldie’. However, he wanted to go back to Oslo – not welcomed by all Norwegians – and returned there on 26 June 1946, but died soon after, at age 59.&lt;ref name=GlasbyBritain/&gt;{{rp|26}}

==Scientific work==
[[File:1915-Goldschmit-VM.jpg|thumb|Victor Moritz Goldschmidt (right), 1915]]
For his thesis, Goldschmidt studied the [[Oslo graben]], a valley formed by the downward displacement of a block of land along faults on each side. The region had recently been mapped by Brøgger. In the [[Permian]], magmas intruded into the older rocks, heating the surrounding rock. This resulted in mineralogical changes known as [[contact metamorphism]], resulting in a fine-grained class of rocks known as [[hornfel]]s. Goldschmidt made a systematic study of the hornfels. He showed that, of the minerals to be found in the hornfels, only certain ''associations'' occurred. For example, [[andalusite]] could be associated with [[cordierite]] but never with [[hypersthene]].&lt;ref name=Mason/&gt;{{rp|13–14}}

[[File:Al2SiO5 phase diagram.svg|thumb|Phase diagram of Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Whitney |first1=Donna L. |title=Coexisting andalusite, kyanite, and sillimanite: Sequential formation of three AlSiO5 polymorphs during progressive metamorphism near the triple point, Sivrihisar, Turkey |journal=American Mineralogist |date=April 2002 |volume=87 |issue=4 |pages=405–416 |doi=10.2138/am-2002-0404}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
From his data on the hornfels, Goldschmidt deduced a ''mineralogical phase rule''. It is a special case of the [[phase rule|Gibb's phase rule]] for phases in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with each other, which states that
:&lt;math&gt;C - P = F - 2,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''C''}} is the minimum number of [[Component (thermodynamics)|chemical components]], {{math|''P''}} is the number of [[Phase (matter)|phases]], and {{math|''F''}} is the number of [[degrees of freedom]] (e.g., temperature and pressure) that can vary without changing {{math|''C''}} or {{math|''P''}}. As an example, the chemical compound Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; can occur naturally as three different minerals: [[andalusite]], [[kyanite]] and [[sillimanite]]. There is a single component ({{math|''C'' {{=}} 1}}), so if all three minerals coexist ({{math|''P'' {{=}} 3}}), then {{math|''F'' {{=}} 0}}. That is, there are no degrees of freedom, so there is only one possible combination of pressure and temperature. This corresponds to the [[triple point]] in the phase diagram.&lt;ref name=Mason/&gt;{{rp|15–16}}

If the same mineral association is found in several rocks over some region, it must have crystallized at a range of temperatures and pressures. In that case, {{math|''F''}} must have been at least 2, so
:&lt;math&gt;C \geq P.&lt;/math&gt;
This expresses Goldschmidt's mineralogical phase rule: the number of phases is no greater than the number of components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Bernard |last1=Fritscher |chapter=Metamorphism and thermodynamics: the formative years |editor-last1=Oldroyd |editor-first1=David Roger |title=The earth inside and out : some major contributions to geology in the twentieth century |date=2002 |publisher=Geological Society of London |isbn=9781862390966 |pages=143–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miyashiro |first1=Akiho |title=Metamorphic petrology |date=1994 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9781857280371 |pages=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, [[Max von Laue]] and [[William L. Bragg]] showed that X-ray scattering could be used to determine the structures of crystals. In the 1920s and 1930s, Goldschmidt and associates at Oslo and Göttingen applied these methods to many common minerals and formulated a set of rules for how elements are grouped. Goldschmidt published this work in the series ''Geochemische Verteilungsgesetze der Elemente'' [Geochemical Laws of the Distribution of Elements]''.&lt;ref name=McSween&gt;{{cite book|last1=McSween, Jr.|first1=Harry Y.|last2=Richardson|first2=Steven M.|last3=Uhle|first3=Maria E.|title=Geochemistry pathways and processes|date=2003|publisher=Columbia University|location=New York|isbn=9780231509039|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mason|first1=Brian|title=Victor Moritz Goldschmidt : father of modern geochemistry|date=1992|publisher=Geochemical Society|location=San Antonio, Tex.|isbn=0-941809-03-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
A textbook, ''Geochemistry'', was edited and published posthumously in England in 1954.&lt;ref name=GlasbyBritain/&gt;{{rp|30}}

==Awards==
Goldschmidt was created a Knight of the [[Order of St. Olav]] in 1929.&lt;ref name=Kauffman/&gt;

While at the Macaulay Institute, Goldschmidt was elected a [[Foreign Member of the Royal Society]],&lt;ref name=Tilley/&gt; given an honorary Doctor of Laws (LLD) by the University of Aberdeen and awarded the [[Wollaston Medal]], the highest honor of the [[Geological Society of London]].&lt;ref name=GlasbyBritain/&gt;

The mountain ridge [[Goldschmidtfjella]] in [[Oscar II Land]] at [[Spitsbergen]] is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://data.npolar.no/placename/5f455e96-b086-5e9b-9219-12e509ff8f8b |title=Goldschmidtfjella (Svalbard) |publisher=[[Norwegian Polar Institute]] |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Women in society sidebar}}
The role of '''women in Egypt''' has changed throughout history, from [[Women in ancient Egypt|ancient]] to modern times. From the earliest preserved [[archaeological]] records, [[Egypt]]ian women were considered nearly equal to men in Egyptian society, regardless of [[marital status]]. 

==Women in ancient Egypt==
{{Main|Women in ancient Egypt}}
[[File:Ahmes nefertari2-2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ahmose-Nefertari]], wife of [[Ahmose I]], in the [[Louvre Museum]], [[Paris]].]]
[[File:Cleopatra and Caesar by Jean-Leon-Gerome.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Cleopatra]] and [[Julius Caesar]]]]
[[File:Egyptian Women Drawing Water (1878) - TIMEA.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Two women holding large water jugs. One is carrying an infant (1878)]]

Women were stated lower than men when it came to a higher leader in the Egyptian hierarchy counting his [[peasants]]. This [[hierarchy]] was similar to the way the peasants were treated in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=WLRAE/&gt; Despite this equality, women were expected to avoid contact with men who were not [[Kinship|kin]] and to veil themselves in public.  As children, females were raised to be solely dependent upon their fathers and older brothers. When women married, they depended on their husbands to make all decisions, while the women themselves were depended upon to carry out household chores.

Married Egyptian women were expected by their husband's families to bear children, but particularly males. It was common for married couples to continue to reproduce until bearing at least two sons. [[Barrenness]] was considered a severe misfortune for Egyptian women, as well as the inability to produce male offspring. Women who had only bore females were given derogatory names, such as "mothers of brides". A family with well-grown sons was considered to have decent security. An Egyptian woman was thought to be at the peak of her power when her sons had married because she automatically acquired the control over the newly growing families of her sons.

Women have traditionally been preoccupied with household tasks and child rearing and have rarely had opportunities for contact with men outside the family. Royal Egyptian women had great impact on Egyptian Society. [[Tiye|Queen Tiye]], the grandmother of [[Tutankhamun|King Tut]] was so enmeshed in politics that neighboring King Mitanni wrote to her to ensure good will between their people when her son Akhenaten ascended to the throne.&lt;ref name="Daniel. 2009"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/262433259|title=In the valley of the kings : Howard Carter and the mystery of King Tutankhamun's tomb|last=Daniel.|first=Meyerson,|date=2009|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=9780345476937|edition= 1st|location=New York|oclc=262433259}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ahmose (queen)|Queen Aahmose]] was awarded the golden flies for military valor.&lt;ref name="Daniel. 2009"/&gt;

[[Cleopatra]] and [[Nefertiti]] were among the better known rulers in Egyptian society. Cleopatra was known to have ruled with [[Marc Antony]] around 31 BC and she was also the [[Coregent]] of her two husband-brothers and her son.&lt;ref&gt;paragraph 5, [http://womenshistory.about.com/od/cleopatra/a/cleopatra.htm Lewis, Jone Johnson. 2006. Cleopatra]. (accessed April 12, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Nefertiti was the chief wife of an Egyptian pharaoh, [[Amenhotep IV]]. Nefertiti was known to be an active Egyptian woman in society, as well as her children.&lt;ref&gt;paragraph 2 [http://womenshistory.about.com/od/cleopatra/a/cleopatra.htm Lewis, Jone Johnson. 2006. Cleopatra]. (accessed April 12, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to female Egyptian rulers, [[Hatshepsut]] usurped the throne&lt;ref name="Daniel. 2009"/&gt; and reigned in Egypt as pharaoh from about 1503 to 1480 B.C. She based most of Egypt's economy on commerce.&lt;ref&gt;paragraph 1 [http://ocean.tamu.edu/Quarterdeck/QD3.1/Elsayed/elsayedhatshepsut.html El-Sayed, Sayed Z. 1995. Queen Hatshepsut's expedition to the Land of Punt: The first oceanographic cruise?] (accessed April 12, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not many women have acted as rulers in Egyptian society, they have been considered to be equal among men in status as well as legal opportunities. Women were shown to be allowed the opportunity to take part in the economy, such as their role as merchants, as it happened later in the [[Roman Empire]], specially among the lower classes. Women had also taken part in religious activities, such as those who were [[priest]]esses. In the [[Sixth Dynasty]] [[Nebet]] became a [[Vizier]] and thus the first woman in History to fulfill such an office.

Women could also own property, divorce their husbands, live alone and occupy main positions, mostly religious, in similarity with [[Assyria]]n women. Only the children from the [[Great Royal Wife]] could expect to succeed to the throne, and if there were no son but daughters by her, then a son by another wife or concubine could only get the throne by marrying the heir daughter, and whoever did so would become the new King.  Either through political and/or religious power, some women managed to become, de facto or de jure, the highest office holders in the kingdom, and share a status of co-rulers with men, even being depicted in monuments with the same height as their husbands or otherwise and even as the other Gods of Egypt.

Such were the cases of [[Hatshepsut]], [[Nefertiti]], [[Nefertari]] and the [[Nubian people|Nubian]] Egyptian Queens. The further Nubian Queens were able to maintain this status. The most important religious offices of that kind were those of [[God's Wife]] and [[God's Wife of Amun]]. Politically, they often managed to become [[Interregnum queen]]s. In the [[Ptolemaic Dynasty]] this rise to power was sublimated with the establishment of a coregency system, in which Queens had the same position as Kings and were even powerful enough to obtain in dispute that coregency for themselves.

==Modern status==
[[File:1995_in_Egypt._Schoolgirls_with_hijab_at_Temple_of_Isis,_Philae._Spielvogel.jpg|thumb|300px|School girls visiting the Egyptian Temple of Isis from [[Philae]] Island (1995).]]
To limit women's contact with men as tradition, practices such as [[Veil#Islam|veiling]] and [[gender segregation]] at schools, work, and recreation have become common.  Furthermore, [[Working class|lower-class]] families, especially in Upper-Egypt, have tended to withdraw females from school as they reached puberty to minimize their interaction with males. Lower-class men frequently preferred marriage to women who had been secluded rather than to those who had worked or attended secondary school.

The rule of [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]] was characterized by his policy of stridently advocating women's rights through welfare-state policies, labeled as [[state feminism]]. Women were guaranteed the right to vote and equality of opportunity was explicitly stated in the 1956 Egyptian constitution, forbidding gender-based discrimination. Labor laws were changed to ensure women's standing in the work force and maternity leave was legally protected. At the same time, the state repressed independent feminist organizations, leaving a dearth of female political representation.&lt;ref name=Hatem/&gt;

The [[Infitah|economic liberalization plan]] of the [[Sadat]] regime resulted in the collapse of this system and the resurgence of Islamist-influenced policy. While the Nasserist years allowed a wide range of study for women, Sadat's policies narrowed the opportunities available to women. Unemployment for women changed from 5.8% 1960 to 40.7% in 1986. In place of policies to economically support women during pregnancy, women were encouraged to leave work entirely or work part-time.&lt;ref name=Hatem/&gt;

The Mubarak years were marked by further erosion of the [[Gender role|role of women]]. Preserved parliamentary seats for women and the 1979 personal status law were repealed in 1987, a new watered-down law taking its place that allowed less power for women in cases of divorce.&lt;ref name=Hatem/&gt;

The migration of a large number of Egyptians, mostly men, has also affected the status of Egyptian women. A study by the [[International Organization for Migration]] found that two-thirds of migrant household interviewed were headed by a woman in the absence of the male migrant (husband/father). For these households, [[remittance]]s represented an important source of income, accounting for 43% of their total income. 52% of wives of the migrants independently decided how to spend the money received. In the remaining cases, the head of the household enjoyed a fair deal of autonomy as the decision on how to use the remittance money was reached through mutual consultation between the migrant and the head of the household and only in a few cases (11%) did the migrant decide alone.&lt;ref&gt;International Organization for Migration, [http://www.egypt.iom.int/Doc/IOM%20Migration%20and%20Development%20in%20Egypt%20Facts%20and%20Figures%20(English).pdf egypt.iom.int]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 [[Pew Research Center]] poll showed that 45% of Egyptian men and 76% of women supported gender equality.&lt;ref name=pew20100701/&gt; The same poll showed that, in principle, people tend to accept a woman's right to work outside the home, with 61% of the respondents agreeing that "women should be able to work outside the home", but at the same time showing some reservations, with only 11% of men and 36% of women completely agreeing with that statement; and 75% agreeing that "when jobs are scarce, men should have more right to a job".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewglobal.org/files/pdf/Pew-Global-Attitudes-2010-Gender-Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Polls taken in 2010 and 2011 show that 39% considered gender equality "very important" to Egypt's future post-revolution and 54% of Egyptians supported sex segregation in the workplace.&lt;ref name=pew110425/&gt;&lt;ref name=pew101202/&gt;

Female genital mutilation was criminalized in Egypt in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Michael|first1=Maggie|title=Egypt acquits doctor in female genital mutilation|url=https://news.yahoo.com/egypt-acquits-doctor-female-genital-mutilation-135425416.html|accessdate=21 November 2014|date=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[UNICEF]] reported that 91% of Egyptian women and girls 15–49 years old had undergone [[female genital mutilation]].&lt;ref name=FGMunicef/&gt; In June 2013 13-year-old Soheir al-Batea died after undergoing FGM. The doctor responsible for the procedure became the first doctor in Egypt to be tried for committing female genital mutilation. On November 20, 2014 he was found not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hayoun|first1=Massoud|title=Egypt’s first FGM trial ends in not guilty verdicts for doctor, father|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/11/20/verdict-tbd-egyptfgmtrialstory.html|accessdate=21 November 2014|date=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[literacy rate]] of women (aged 15 and over) is 65.4%, which is lower than that of men which is 82.2% (data from 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|author=|date=|website=www.cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt is largely rural country, with only 43.1% of the population being urban (in 2015),&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|author=|date=|website=www.cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and access to education is poor in rural areas.

Most women in Egypt have adopted some form of veiling,&lt;ref name=Slackman1&gt;{{cite news|last=Slackman|first=Michael|title=In Egypt, A new Battle Begins over the veil|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/weekinreview/28slackman.html|accessdate=23 November 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=28 Jan 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a majority of Egyptian women covering at least their hair with the [[hijab]]; however covering the face with a [[niqāb]] is only practiced by a minority of women (see [[Niqāb in Egypt]]).

Families are usually of medium size, with the [[total fertility rate]] (TFR) being 3.53 children born/woman (2016 estimate).&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; The contraception prevalence rate is high, at 60.3% (in 2008).&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt;

In a 2013 poll of gender experts, Egypt ranked worst for women's rights out of all the Arab states.&lt;ref name="aljazeera.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boros|first1=Crina|title=Poll: Egypt is worst Arab state for women|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/11/poll-egypt-worst-arab-state-women-2013111295848639116.html|accessdate=5 November 2014|date=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence against women===
{{further|Mass sexual assault in Egypt}}

====Sexual violence====
In a 2010 survey of 1,010 women by the Egyptian Center for Women's rights, 98% of foreign women and 83% of native women said they had been sexually harassed in Egypt and two-thirds of men said that they had harassed women.&lt;ref name=tw110217/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn110217/&gt; Women who wore conservative attire, an Islamic headscarf or [[niqab]], were also targeted.&lt;ref name=bbc0912/&gt; In 2013, the [[UN Women|United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women]] reported that 99.3% of Egyptian women had experienced some form of harassment.&lt;ref name=UNW2013/&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] reported 91 sexual assaults in four days from 30 June 2013 during the Tahrir Square protests, as well as 19 cases of mob sexual assaults in January.&lt;ref name=hrw130703/&gt; The deputy Middle East director at HRW said that the attacks were "holding women back from participating fully in the public life of Egypt at a critical point in the country's development."&lt;ref name=hrw130703/&gt; On June 4, 2013, a law criminalizing sexual harassment for the first time in modern Egyptian history was approved by then interim president, [[Adly Mansour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New law to end sexual harassment in Egypt|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/06/new-law-end-sexual-harassment-egypt-2014612101924323684.html|accessdate=7 November 2014|date=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Honor killings====
[[Honor killings]] take place in Egypt relatively frequently, due to reasons such as a woman meeting an unrelated man, even if this is only an allegation; or adultery (real or suspected).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbv-awareness.com/egypts-rise-in-honor-killings-sparks-regional-debate/|title=Egypt’s rise in honor killings sparks regional debate|author=|date=|website=hbv-awareness.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/vaw-gp-2005/docs/experts/khafagy.honorcrimes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charismanews.com/world/55370-forbidden-romance-results-in-honor-killings-for-coptic-women|title=Forbidden Romance Results in Honor Killings for Coptic Women|first=World Watch|last=Monitor|date=|website=charismanews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Female genital mutilation====
{{See|Prevalence of female genital mutilation by country}}

[[Female genital mutilation]] (FGM) is widespread in Egypt, with a majority of women having undergone some version of the procedure,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGMC_2016_brochure_final_UNICEF_SPREAD.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; although the practice is less common among the youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/4/07-042093/en/|title=WHO - Prevalence of female genital cutting among Egyptian girls|author=|date=|website=www.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is deeply engrained in the culture and predates both Christianity and Islam. Its main purpose is to preserve chastity, though its social function is very complicated. FGM was banned in 2008, but enforcement of the law was weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-middle-east-36447623/calls-for-egypt-to-end-fgm-after-death-of-teenager|title=Calls for Egypt to end FGM after death|author=|date=|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, they tightened the law and made it a felony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/08/middleeast/egypt-law-fgm/|title=Egypt toughens penalties for FGM|first=Sarah Sirgany, for|last=CNN|date=|website=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women continued to face inadequate protection from sexual and gender-based violence, as well as gender discrimination in law and practice, particularly under personal status laws regulating divorce. A 17-year-old girl died on 29 May, reportedly from haemorrhaging, following female genital mutilation (FGM) at a private hospital in Suez Governorate. Four people faced trial on charges of causing lethal injury and FGM, including the girl’s mother and medical staff as per Amnesty 2016/2017 report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2017/02/amnesty-international-annual-report-201617/|title=Amnesty International Annual Report 2016/17|website=www.amnesty.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and divorce==
Marriage was considered a very important part in ancient Egyptian society. Marriage was an almost completely private affair, and as a result, not many records of marriage were kept.&lt;ref&gt;paragraph 14 [http://fathom.lib.uchicago.edu/1/777777190170/  Johnson, Janet H. 2002. Women's Legal Rights in Ancient Egypt]. (accessed April 12, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, not all Egyptian marriages were [[arranged marriage|arranged]], rather, most daughters had persuaded their families for their approval towards their future spouses.

Egyptian women who were married were highly acknowledged. It was common for females to marry after the age of [[menstruation]], such as age 14. They were usually considered married after they had left the protection of their father's house. It had also been acknowledged that though the woman became under her spouse's care, her husband did not become her legal guardian and the woman remained independent while controlling her own assets. For the non-royal women in ancient Egypt, the title of wife also came with the title "Mistress of the House". 
The role as a wife included taking care of the household.

Egypt's laws pertaining to marriage and divorce have changed over the years, however they have generally favored the social position of men, although reform continues. Egypt retained the inclusion of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] in dealings of [[family law]], following on from its judicial and administrative independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito &amp; DeLong-Bas, Women in Muslim Family Law, p47&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim husbands were traditionally allowed to have up to four wives at a time in accordance with Islamic religious custom, but a woman could have only one husband at a time.  A Muslim man could divorce his wife with ease by saying "I divorce thee" on three separate occasions in the presence of witnesses. However, for example in the more strict [[Hanafi]] school of family law, a woman could only divorce from her husband in the case of his impotence or by choosing the 'option of puberty'. The first reforms that changed this state of affairs came in the 1920s with Law No.25 of 1920 and 1929. These reforms included the following specifics regarding legitimate grounds for a woman requesting a divorce:

#If her husband failed to provide maintenance. ([[nafaqah]])
#If her husband was found to have a dangerous or contagious disease.
#If she was deserted by her husband. 
#If she was maltreated by her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito &amp; DeLong-Bas, ''Women in Muslim Family Law'', p51&lt;/ref&gt;

These reforms were possible through the [[Maliki]] school of thought, which was more liberal. As suggested by [[Rifa'a el-Tahtawi]], a more progressive attitude towards the rights of women could be achieved whilst remaining within an Islamic framework, by looking to another of the [[Sunni]] schools. In 1971 further reforms were made and these even began to include debates about whether or not [[Shariah law]] should be included in the new constitution. Dr. Aisha Ratib became Minister of Social Affairs and in November the following revisions were suggested:

#That the age for legal marriage should be raised to 18 for women and 21 for men
#That the permission of a judge was required for polygamy
#That divorces could not take place without a judge being present
#That the mother should be allowed a greater period of [[guardianship]], but also that guardianship in the case of divorce should go to the parent deemed most suitable to provide it
#That judges should have more involvement in family law cases, and that female judges should be considered to deal with family law cases.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito &amp; DeLong-Bas, ''Women in Muslim Family Law'', p58&lt;/ref&gt;

The government amended the laws relating to personal status in 1979. The amendments, which became known as the "women's rights law," were in the form of a presidential decree and subsequently approved by the [[Egyptian People's Assembly|People's Assembly]]. The leading orthodox Islamic clergy endorsed these amendments, but Islamist groups opposed them as state infringements of religious precepts and campaigned for their repeal. The amendments stated that polygamy was legally harmful to a first wife and entitled her to sue for divorce within a year after learning of her husband's second marriage. The amendments also entitled the first wife to compensation.

A husband retained the right to divorce his wife without recourse to the courts, but he was required to file for his divorce before witnesses at a registrar's office and officially and immediately to inform his wife. The divorced wife was entitled to alimony equivalent to one year's maintenance in addition to compensation equivalent to two years' maintenance; a court could increase these amounts under extenuating circumstances such as the dissolution of a long marriage. The divorced wife automatically retained custody of sons under the age of ten and daughters under twelve; courts could extend the mother's custody of minors until their eighteenth birthdays.
[[File:11th of February evening - Freedom has come! (Females).jpg|thumb|right|280px|Women during the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]]]]

In 1985 Egyptian authorities ruled that the amendments of 1979 were unconstitutional because they had been enacted through a presidential decree while the People's Assembly was not in session. A new law reversed many of the rights accorded to women in 1979. A woman lost her automatic right to divorce her husband if he married a second wife. She could still petition a court to consider her case, but a judge would grant a divorce only if it were in the interests of the family. If a divorce were granted, the judge would also determine what was an appropriate residence for the divorced woman and her children.

The changes in divorce legislation in 1979 and 1985 did not significantly alter the divorce rate, which has been relatively high since the early 1950s. About one in five marriages ended in divorce in the 1980s. Remarriage was common, and most divorced men and women expected to wed again. Seven out of ten divorces took place within the first five years of marriage, and one out of three in the first year. The divorce rate depended on residence and level of education. The highest divorce rates were among the urban lower class, the lowest rates among the villagers of [[Upper Egypt]]. Throughout the country, as much as 95 percent of all divorces occurred among couples who were illiterate.

Marital rape is not specifically outlawed in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Provost|first1=Claire|title=UN Women justice report: get the data|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jul/06/un-women-legal-rights-data|accessdate=5 November 2014|date=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
