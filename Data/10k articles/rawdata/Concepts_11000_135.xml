      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3020">A '''Cambridge change''' is a philosophical concept of change according to which an [[entity]] ''x'' has changed ''[[if and only if]]'' there is some [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] F that is true (not true) of ''x'' at a time ''t1'' but not true (true) of ''x'' at some later time ''t2''.

==History==
The term ''Cambridge change'' was coined by [[Peter Geach]] in the late 1960s,&lt;ref name="Geach"&gt;Geach, P.T. (1969). ''God and the Soul''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/change/ Change]". ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Retrieved on 2009-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[J. M. E. McTaggart|McTaggart]], philosophers active at [[Cambridge University]].

==Example==
Suppose that at ''t1'', person A is 180&amp;nbsp;cm tall and person B is 175&amp;nbsp;cm tall, while at time ''t2'' A is still 180&amp;nbsp;cm tall but B has grown to be 185&amp;nbsp;cm tall.  Since the predicate 'is taller than B' is true of A at ''t1'' but not true of A at ''t2'', A has changed according to the Cambridge change definition of "change"—he has gone from being taller than B to not being taller than B.

Intuitively, however, it is only person B, and not person A, who has changed: B has grown by 10&amp;nbsp;cm, but A has stayed the same.  This problem with Cambridge changes is usually thought to call for a distinction between [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic]] and [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|extrinsic]], or natural and non-natural, properties.  Given such a distinction, it is possible to define "real" change by requiring that the respective predicates express an intrinsic change in a property, such as a change in height from 175&amp;nbsp;cm to 185&amp;nbsp;cm, rather than an extrinsic change in a property, such as being now taller than B.

But this assumes that there "really" are strictly unary (non-relational) properties that, as such, are thus intrinsic. Namely, a property is intrinsic if and only if it is actually (really, analytically, fundamentally, necessarily, ontologically) unary.

But imagine that all "meter sticks" as of time "t2" have contracted at a rate such that B's height at time "t2" would be measured as having increased by 10&amp;nbsp;cm. Imagine further that A's height has actually (really) shrunk so that it would be measured with a respectively shrinking meter stick as remaining constant from time "t1" to time "t2".

Intuitively, B's height will have remained the same whereas A's height and all ways of measuring height will have changed. In this case, it is A's height and all ways of measuring height that will have changed. The problem with the notion of "Cambridge change" is its failure to acknowledge that B's or anything else's height is relational (relative to ways of measuring height). "Height" is thus not unary and thus is extrinsic, not intrinsic.

[[File:Jacques-Louis David - Oath of the Horatii - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|320px|[[Jacques-Louis David]]'s 1786 painting ''[[Oath of the Horatii|The Oath of the Horatii]]'', illustrating a dramatic moment from [[Livy]]'s history of Rome, embodies eighteenth century ideas about '''civic virtue'''.]]
'''Civic virtue''' is the cultivation of [[habit (psychology)|habits]] important for the success of the community. Closely linked to the concept of [[citizenship]], civic [[virtue]] is often conceived as the dedication of citizens to the common welfare of their community even at the cost of their individual interests. The identification of the character traits that constitute civic virtue has been a major concern of [[political philosophy]]. The term ''civility'' refers to [[behavior]] between persons and groups that conforms to a [[society|social]] mode (that is, in accordance with the [[civil society]]), as itself being a foundational [[principle]] of society and [[law]].

==In republics==
Civic virtues have historically taught as a matter of chief concern in nations under [[republic]]an forms of government, and societies with [[cities]]. When final decisions on public matters are made by a [[monarch]], it is the ''monarch's'' virtues which influence those decisions. When a broader class of people become the decision-makers, it is then their virtues which characterize the types of decisions made. This form of decision-making is considered superior in determining what best protects the interests of the majority. [[Aristocracy|Aristocratic]] [[oligarchies]] may also develop traditions of public lists of virtues they believe appropriate in the governing class, but these virtues differ significantly from those who are generally identified under the category of civic virtue, stressing [[war|martial]] [[courage]] over [[commerce|commercial]] [[honesty]]. [[Constitution]]s became important in defining the public virtue of republics and constitutional monarchies. The earliest forms of constitutional development can be seen in late medieval Germany (see [[Communalism before 1800]]) and in the Dutch and English revolts of the 16th and 17th centuries.

===In ancient Greece and Rome===
{{Republicanism sidebar}}
{{See also|Arete (moral virtue)|Virtus (virtue)}}
In the [[classical antiquity|classical]] culture of [[Western Europe]] and those places that follow its political tradition, concern for civic virtue starts with the oldest republics of which we have extensive records, [[Athens]] and [[Rome]]. Attempting to define the virtues needed to successfully govern the Athenian ''[[polis]]'' was a matter of significant concern for [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]]; a difference in civic vision ultimately was one of the [[wikt:factor|factor]]s that led to the [[trial of Socrates]] and his conflict with the Athenian [[democracy]]. The '' [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' of [[Aristotle]] viewed [[citizenship]] as consisting, not of political [[rights]], but rather of political [[duties]]. Citizens were expected to put their private lives and interests aside and serve the [[State (polity)|state]] in accordance with duties defined by law.

Rome, even more than [[ancient Greece|Greece]], produced a number of moralistic philosophers such as [[Cicero]], and moralistic [[historiography|historians]] such as [[Tacitus]], [[Sallust]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Livy]]. Many of these figures were either personally involved in power struggles that took place in the late [[Roman Republic]], or wrote elegies to [[liberty]] which was lost during their transition to the [[Roman Empire]]. They tended to blame this loss of liberty on the perceived lack of civic virtue in their contemporaries, contrasting them with idealistic examples of virtue drawn from Roman history, and even non-Roman "[[barbarian]]s".

===During the Medieval Age and the Renaissance===
Texts of antiquity became very popular by the [[Renaissance]]. Scholars tried to gather as many of them as they could find, especially in monasteries, from Constantinople, and from the Muslim world. Aided by the rediscovery of the [[virtue ethics]] and [[metaphysics]] of [[Aristotle]] by [[Avicenna]] and [[Averroes]], [[Thomas Aquinas]] fused [[Aristotle]]'s [[cardinal virtue]]s with [[Christianity]] in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' (1273).

[[Humanism|Humanists]] wanted to reinstate the ancient ideal of civic virtue through education. Instead of punishing sinners, it was believed that sin could be prevented by raising virtuous children. Living in the city became important for the elite, because people in the city are forced to behave themselves when communicating with others. A problem was that the [[Proletariat|proletarianization]] of peasants created an environment in cities where such workers were hard to control. Cities tried to keep the proletarians out or tried to civilize them by forcing them to work in poor houses. Important aspects of civic virtue were: civic conversation (listening to others, trying to reach an agreement, keeping yourself informed so you can have a relevant contribution), civilized behavior (decent clothing, accent, containing feelings and needs), work (people had to make a useful contribution to the society). Religion changed. It became more focused on individual behavior instead of a communion of people. The people who believed in civic virtue belonged to a small majority surrounded by "barbarity". Parental authority was popular, especially the authority of the monarch and the state.&lt;ref&gt;John Hale, ''The Civilization of Europe in the Renaissance'' (London 1993){{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== During the Enlightenment ===
Civic virtue was very popular during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] but it had changed dramatically. Parental authority began to wane. Freedom became popular. But people can only be free by containing their emotions in order to keep some space for others. Trying to keep proletarians out or putting them in a poor house was not done anymore. The focus was now on educating. Work was an important virtue during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, but the people who worked were treated with contempt by the non-working elite. The 18th century brought an end to this. The advancing rich merchants class emphasized the importance of work and contributing to society for all people including the elite. Science was popular. The government and the elites tried to change the world and humanity positively by expanding the bureaucracy. Leading thinkers thought that education and the breach of barriers would liberate everybody from stupidity and oppression. Civic conversations were held in societies and scientific journals.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Roche, ''La France des Lumières'' (Paris 1993){{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the republican revolutions of the 18th century===
Civic virtue also became a matter of public interest and discussion during the 18th century, in part because of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. An [[anecdote]] first published in 1906 has [[Benjamin Franklin]] answer a woman who asked him, "Well, Doctor, what have we got&amp;nbsp;– a Republic or a Monarchy?" He responded: "A Republic, if you can keep it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/73/1593.html 1593. Benjamin Franklin (1706–90). Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations. 1989&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]{{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current use for this quotation is to bolster with Franklin's authority the opinion that republics require the cultivation of specific political beliefs, interests, and habits among their citizens, and that if those habits are not cultivated, they are in danger of falling back into some sort of authoritarian rule, such as a monarchy.

American historian [[Gordon S. Wood]] called it a universal 18th-century assumption that, while no form of government was more beautiful than a republic, monarchies had various advantages: the pomp and circumstances surrounding them cultivated a sense that the rulers were in fact superior to the ruled and entitled to their obedience, and maintained order by their presence. By contrast, in a republic, the rulers were the servants of the public, and there could therefore be no sustained coercion from them. Laws had to be obeyed for the sake of conscience, rather than fear of the ruler's wrath.  In a monarchy, people might be restrained by force to submit their own interest to their government's. In a republic, by contrast, people must be ''persuaded'' to submit their own interests to the government, and this voluntary submission constituted the 18th century's notion of civic virtue. In the absence of such persuasion, the authority of the government would collapse, and [[tyranny]] or [[Anomie|anarchy]] were imminent.

Authority for this ideal was found once more among the classical, and especially the Roman, political authors and historians. But since the Roman writers wrote during a time when the Roman republican ideal was fading away, its forms but not its spirit or substance being preserved in the Roman Empire, the 18th-century American and [[French Revolution|French revolutionaries]] read them with a spirit to determine how the Roman republic failed, and how to avoid repeating that failure. In his ''Reflections on the Rise and Fall of the Antient Republicks'', the [[England|English]] [[British Whig Party|Whig]] [[Whig history|historian]] [[Edward Wortley Montagu (traveller)|Edward Wortley Montagu]] sought to describe "the principal causes of that degeneracy of manners, which reduc'd those once brave and free people into the most abject slavery." Following this reading of Roman ideals, the American revolutionary [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]] envisioned a [[Sparta]]n, [[egalitarian]] society where every man was a [[soldier]] and master of his own land, and where people were "instructed from early infancy to deem themselves property of the State.... (and) were ever ready to sacrifice their concerns to her interests." The [[agrarianism]] of [[Thomas Jefferson]] represents a similar belief system; Jefferson believed that the ideal republic was composed of independent, [[rural]] [[agriculturalists]] rather than [[city|urban]] [[Tradesman|tradesmen]].

[[File:MacMonnies' Civic Virtue 1922.JPG|thumb|[[Civic Virtue (sculpture)|Civic Virtue]], 1919]]
These widely held ideals led American revolutionaries to found institutions such as the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], named after the Roman [[farmer]] and [[dictator]] [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus|Cincinnatus]], who according to Livy left his farm to lead the army of the Roman republic during a crisis, and voluntarily returned to his plow once the crisis had passed. About Cincinnatus, Livy writes:
{{quote|''Operae pretium est audire qui omnia prae diuitiis humana spernunt neque honori magno locum neque uirtuti putant esse, nisi ubi effuse afluant opes....''&lt;br&gt;(It is worth while for those who disdain all human things for money, and who suppose that there is no room either for great honor or virtue, except where wealth is found, to listen to his story.)|Livy|''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', book III.}}

===19th to mid-20th century===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2008}}
Civic virtues were especially important during the 19th and 20th century.{{According to whom|date=February 2010}} Class and profession greatly affected the virtues of the individual, and there was a general division about what the best civic virtues were. Additionally several major [[ideologies]] came into being, each with their own ideas about civic virtues.

[[Conservatism]] emphasized family values and obedience to the father and the state. [[Nationalism]] carried by masses of people made [[patriotism]] an important civic virtue. [[Liberalism]] combined republicanism with a belief in progress and liberalization based on [[capitalism]]. Civic virtues focused on individual behavior and responsibility were very important. Many liberals turned into socialists or conservatives in the end of the 19th century and early 20th century.{{According to whom|date=February 2010}} Others became social liberals, valuing capitalism with a strong government to protect the poor. A focus on agriculture and [[landed nobility]] was supplanted by a focus on industry and civil society.

An important civic virtue for [[socialist]]s was that people be conscious of oppression within society and the forces which uphold the status quo. This consciousness should result in action to change the world for the good, so that everybody can become respectful citizens in a modern society.

[[National Socialism]], the German variant of twentieth century fascism whose precepts were laid out in [[Adolf Hitler|Adolf Hitler's]] [[Mein Kampf]], classified inhabitants of the ideal nation into three main hierarchical categories, each of which had different rights and duties in relation to the state: citizens, subjects, and aliens. The first category, citizens, were to possess full civic rights and responsibilities. Citizenship would be conferred only on those males of pure racial stock who had completed military service, and could be revoked at any time by the state. Only women who worked independently or who married a citizen could obtain citizenship for themselves. The second category, subjects, referred to all others who were born within the nation's boundaries who did not fit the racial criteria for citizenship. Subjects would have no voting rights, could not hold any position within the state, and possessed none of the other rights and civic responsibilities conferred on citizens. The final category, aliens, referred to those who were citizens of another state, who also had no rights:

{{Quote|text=''"The People's State will classify its population in three groups: Citizens, subjects of the State, and aliens.

The principle is that birth within the confines of the State gives only the status of a subject. It does not carry with it the right to fill any position under the State or to participate in political life, such as taking an active or passive part in elections. Another principle is that the race and nationality of every subject of the State will have to be proved. A subject is at any time free to cease being a subject and to become a citizen of that country to which he belongs in virtue of his nationality. The only difference between an alien and a subject of the State is that the former is a citizen of another country.

[...]The citizen has privileges which are not accorded to the alien. He is the master in the Reich. But this high honour has also its obligations. Those who show themselves without personal honour or character, or common criminals, or traitors to the fatherland, can at any time be deprived of the rights of citizenship. Therewith they become merely subjects of the State."''|sign=[[Adolf Hitler]]|source=[[Mein Kampf]] Volume II: The National Socialist Movement, Chapter III: Subjects and Citizens}}

===In later times===
[[File:Cover of McGuffey's First Eclectic Reader.jpeg|right|thumb|180px|The cover of an ''[[McGuffey Readers|Eclectic First Reader]]'' [[book]].]]
A number of institutions and organizations promote the idea of civic virtue in the older democracies. Among such organizations are the [[Boy Scouts of America]], and [[Civil Air Patrol]] whose U.S. [[oath]], Cadet Oath and Cadet Honor Code reflect a goal to foster habits aimed at serving a larger community:

Boy Scouts of America Scout Oath:
{{quote|''On my honor I will do my best&lt;br&gt;To do my duty to God and my country&lt;br&gt;and to obey the Scout Law;&lt;br&gt;To help other people at all times;&lt;br&gt;To keep myself physically strong,&lt;br&gt;mentally awake, and morally straight.''}}


Boy Scouts of America Scout Law:
{{quote|''A Scout is Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Kind, Obedient, Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, Clean, and Reverent.''}}

Cadet Oath:
{{quote|''I pledge that I will serve faithfully in the Civil Air Patrol Cadet Program, and that I will attend meetings regularly, participate actively in unit activities, obey my officers, wear my uniform properly, and advance my education and training rapidly to prepare myself to be of service to my community, state and nation.''}}

Air Force Academy Cadet Honor Code:
{{quote|''We will not lie, steal, or cheat, nor tolerate among us anyone who does. Furthermore, I resolve to do my duty and live honorably (so help me God).''}}

Institutions that might be said to encourage civic virtue include the [[school]], particularly with [[social studies]] courses, and the [[prison]], namely in its [[Penology|rehabilitative]] function.

Other, later phenomena associated with the concept of civic virtue include ''[[McGuffey Readers|McGuffey's Eclectic Readers]]'', a series of [[primary education|primary school]] [[textbook]]s whose compiler, [[William Holmes McGuffey]], deliberately sought out patriotic and religious sentiments to instill these values in the children who read them. [[William Bennett]], a [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration cabinet member turned [[conservatism|conservative]] commentator, produced ''[[The Book of Virtues: A Treasury of Great Moral Stories]]'' in 1993, another [[anthology]] of literary materials that might be considered an attempt to update McGuffey's concept.

==Comparable ideas in non-Western societies==
[[Confucianism]], which specifies cultural virtues and traditions which all members of society are to observe, in particular the heads of households and those who govern, was the basis of Chinese society for more than 2000 years and is still influential in modern China. Its related concepts can be compared to the Western idea of civic virtue.

==Related concepts==
;Friendliness
:Friendliness is a [[pro-social]] set of behaviors seen in people who are pleasant, agreeable, interested in others, genial, empathetic, considerate, and helpful.  Not all civil behaviors are friendly.  For example, [[duelling]] in response to an intolerable insult has been considered a civil behavior in many cultures, but it is not a friendly action.
;[[Politeness]]
:Politeness focuses on the application of good manners or [[etiquette]].  Because politeness is informed by cultural values, there is substantial overlap between what is polite and what is civil.  However, if the action in question is not related to civic virtues, then it may be polite or rude, without strictly being considered civil or incivil.
;[[Social graces]]
:The social graces include [[deportment]], [[Gracefulness|poise]], and [[fashion]], which are unrelated to civility.
;[[Incivility]]
:Incivility is a general term for social behavior lacking in civic virtue or good [[manners]], on a scale from [[rude]]ness or lack of [[respect]] for elders, to [[vandalism]] and [[hooliganism]], through [[public intoxication|public drunkenness]] and threatening behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.askoxford.com/results/?view=dict&amp;freesearch=incivility&amp;branch=13842570&amp;textsearchtype=exact |work=[[AskOxford]] |title=Definition of 'Incivility{{'-}} |accessdate=2006-11-25}}{{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''incivility'' is derived from the Latin ''incivilis'', meaning "not of a citizen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Soanes |editor-first=Catherine |editor2-last=Stevenson |editor2-first=Angus |title=The Oxford Dictionary of English (revised edition) |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005}}{{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The distinction between plain rudeness, and perceived incivility as threat, will depend on some notion of "civility" as structural to society; incivility as anything more ominous than bad manners is therefore dependent on appeal to notions like its antagonism to the complex concepts of civic virtue or civil society. It has become a contemporary political issue in a number of countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Incivility in Political Discourse (The Coming Apogee of the Moonbat Hordes) |url=http://www.indcjournal.com/archives/001136.php |work=[InDC Journal] |accessdate=2006-11-25 |date=2004-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130103133948/http://www.indcjournal.com/archives/001136.php |archivedate=2013-01-03 |df= }}{{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parabola.svg|right|thumb|A [[parabola]], a simple example of a curve]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''curve''' (also called a '''curved line''' in older texts) is, generally speaking, an object similar to a [[line (geometry)|line]] but that need not be [[Linearity|straight]]. Thus, a curve is a generalization of a line, in that its [[curvature]] need not be zero.{{efn|In current mathematical usage, a line is straight.

Various disciplines within mathematics have given the term different meanings depending on the area of study, so the precise meaning depends on context. However, many of these meanings are special instances of the definition which follows. A curve is a [[topological space]] which is locally [[homeomorphic]] to a line. In everyday language, this means that a curve is a set of points which, near each of its points, looks like a line, up to a deformation.  A simple example of a curve is the [[parabola]], shown to the right. A [[list of curves|large number of other curves]] have been studied in multiple mathematical fields.

A '''closed curve''' is a curve that forms a [[path (topology)|path]] whose starting point is also its ending point—that is, a path from any of its points to the same point.

Closely related meanings include the [[graph of a function]] (for example, [[Phillips curve]]) and a [[two-dimensional graph]].

==History==
[[File:Newgrange Entrance Stone.jpg|thumb|225px|[[Megalithic art]] from Newgrange showing an early interest in curves]]
Interest in curves began long before they were the subject of mathematical study.  This can be seen in numerous examples of their decorative use in art and on everyday objects dating back to prehistoric
times.&lt;ref name="Lockwood"&gt;Lockwood p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; Curves, or at least their graphical representations, are simple to create, for example by a stick in the sand on a beach.

Historically, the term "line" was used in place of the more modern term "curve". Hence the phrases "straight line" and "right line" were used to distinguish what are today called lines from "curved lines". For example, in Book I of [[Euclid's Elements]], a line is defined as a "breadthless length" (Def. 2), while a ''straight'' line is defined as "a line that lies evenly with the points on itself" (Def. 4). Euclid's idea of a line is perhaps clarified by the statement "The extremities of a line are points," (Def. 3).&lt;ref&gt;Heath p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Later commentators further classified lines according to various schemes. For example:&lt;ref&gt;Heath p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;
*Composite lines (lines forming an angle)
*Incomposite lines
**Determinate (lines that do not extend indefinitely, such as the circle)
**Indeterminate (lines that extend indefinitely, such as the straight line and the parabola)

[[File:Conic sections with plane.svg|thumb|225px|The curves created by slicing a cone ([[conic section]]s) were among the curves studied in ancient Greece.]]
The Greek [[geometers]] had studied many other kinds of curves. One reason was their interest in solving geometrical problems that could not be solved using standard [[compass and straightedge]] construction.
These curves include:
*The [[conic section]]s, deeply studied by [[Apollonius of Perga]]
*The [[cissoid of Diocles]], studied by [[Diocles (mathematician)|Diocles]] and used as a method to [[doubling the cube|double the cube]].&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[conchoid of Nicomedes]], studied by [[Nicomedes (mathematician)|Nicomedes]] as a method to both double the cube and to [[angle trisection|trisect an angle]].&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Archimedean spiral]], studied by [[Archimedes]] as a method to trisect an angle and [[Squaring the circle|square the circle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|class=Curves|id=Spiral|title=Spiral of Archimedes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[spiric section]]s, sections of [[torus|tori]] studied by [[Perseus (geometer)|Perseus]] as sections of cones had been studied by Apollonius.

[[File:Folium Of Descartes.svg|thumb|225px|left|Analytic geometry allowed curves, such as the [[Folium of Descartes]], to be defined using equations instead of geometrical construction.]]
A fundamental advance in the theory of curves was the advent of [[analytic geometry]] in the seventeenth century. This enabled a curve to be described using an equation rather than an elaborate geometrical construction. This not only allowed new curves to be defined and studied, but it enabled a formal distinction to be made between curves that can be defined using [[algebraic equation]]s, [[algebraic curve]]s, and those that cannot, [[transcendental curve]]s. Previously, curves had been described as "geometrical" or "mechanical" according to how they were, or supposedly could be, generated.&lt;ref name="Lockwood" /&gt;

Conic sections were applied in [[astronomy]] by [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]].
Newton also worked on an early example in the [[calculus of variations]]. Solutions to variational problems, such as the [[brachistochrone]] and [[tautochrone]] questions, introduced properties of curves in new ways (in this case, the [[cycloid]]). The [[catenary]] gets its name as the solution to the problem of a hanging chain, the sort of question that became routinely accessible by means of [[differential calculus]].

In the eighteenth century came the beginnings of the theory of plane algebraic curves, in general. Newton had studied the [[cubic curve]]s, in the general description of the real points into 'ovals'. The statement of [[Bézout's theorem]] showed a number of aspects which were not directly accessible to the geometry of the time, to do with singular points and complex solutions.

Since the nineteenth century there has not been a separate theory of curves, but rather the appearance of curves as the one-dimensional aspect of [[projective geometry]], and [[differential geometry]]; and later [[topology]], when for example the [[Jordan curve theorem]] was understood to lie quite deep, as well as being required in [[complex analysis]]. The era of the [[space-filling curve]]s finally provoked the modern definitions of curve.

=={{anchor|Definitions}} Definition==
[[File:Mandelbrot Components.svg|250px|right|thumb|Boundaries of hyperbolic components of [[Mandelbrot set]] as closed curves]]

In general, a '''curve''' is defined through a [[continuous function (topology)|continuous function]] &lt;math&gt;\gamma \colon I \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; from an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{mvar|I}} of the [[real number]]s into a [[topological space]] {{mvar|X}}. Depending on the context, it is either &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; or its image &lt;math&gt;\gamma(I)&lt;/math&gt; which is called a curve.

In [[general topology]], when non-[[differentiable function]]s are considered, it is the map &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, which is called a curve, because its image may look very differently from what is commonly called a curve. For example, the image of the [[Peano curve]] completely fills the square. On the other hand, when one considers curves defined by a [[differentiable function]] (or, at least, a [[piecewise differentiable]] function), this is commonly the image of the function which is called a curve.

*The curve is said to be '''simple''', or a '''Jordan arc''', if &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is [[injective]], i.e. if for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\gamma(x) = \gamma(y)&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt;.   If &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is a closed bounded interval &lt;math&gt;[a, b]&lt;/math&gt;, we also allow the possibility &lt;math&gt;\gamma(a) = \gamma(b)&lt;/math&gt; (this convention makes it possible to talk about "closed" simple curves, see below). In other words, this curve "does not cross itself and has no missing points".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/jordan%20arc |title=Jordan arc definition at Dictionary.com. Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc |publisher=[[Dictionary.reference.com]] |date= |accessdate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*If &lt;math&gt;\gamma(x)=\gamma(y)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;x\ne y&lt;/math&gt; (other than the extremities of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;), then &lt;math&gt;\gamma(x)&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''double''' (or '''multiple''') '''point''' of the curve. This is a special case of a [[singular point of a curve]].
*A curve &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''closed''' or '''a loop''' if &lt;math&gt;I = [a,
b]&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;\gamma(a) = \gamma(b)&lt;/math&gt;.  A closed curve is thus the image of a continuous mapping of the circle &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt;; a '''simple closed curve''' is also called a '''Jordan curve'''. The [[Jordan curve theorem]] states that such curves divide the plane into an "interior" and an "exterior".

{{anchor|Space curve}}
A '''[[plane curve]]''' is a curve for which &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Euclidean plane]]&amp;mdash;these are the examples first encountered&amp;mdash;or in some cases the [[projective plane]]. A '''space curve''' is a curve for which &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is of three dimensions, usually [[Euclidean space]]; a '''skew curve''' {{anchor|skew curve}} is a space curve which lies in no plane. These definitions of plane, space and skew curves apply also to [[real algebraic geometry|real algebraic curve]]s, although the above definition of a curve does not apply (a real algebraic curve may be [[connected space|disconnected]]).

This definition of curve captures our intuitive notion of a curve as a connected, continuous geometric figure that is "like" a line, without thickness and drawn without interruption, although it also includes figures that can hardly be called curves in common usage. For example, the image of a curve can cover a [[Square (geometry)|square]] in the plane ([[space-filling curve]]). The image of simple plane curve can have [[Hausdorff dimension]] bigger than one (see [[Koch snowflake]]) and even [[positive number|positive]] [[Lebesgue measure]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osgood|first=William F.| authorlink1=William Fogg Osgood |date=January 1903|title=A Jordan Curve of Positive Area|journal=Transactions of the American Mathematical Society|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|volume=4|issue=1|pages=107–112|doi=10.2307/1986455|issn=0002-9947|jstor=1986455}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2008-06-04--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (the last example can be obtained by small variation of the [[Peano curve]] construction). The [[dragon curve]] is another unusual example.

==Differentiable curve==
Roughly speaking a '''differentiable curve''' is a curve that is defined as being locally the image of an injective [[differentiable function]] &lt;math&gt;\gamma \colon I \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; from an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{mvar|I}} of the [[real number]]s into a [[differentiable manifold]] {{mvar|X}}, often &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n.&lt;/math&gt;

More precisely, a differentiable curve is a subset {{mvar|C}} of {{mvar|X}} where every point of {{mvar|C}} has a neighborhood {{mvar|U}} such that &lt;math&gt;C\cap U&lt;/math&gt; is [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to an interval of the real numbers. In other words, a differentiable curve is a differentiable manifold of dimension one.

==Length of a curve==
{{main|Arc length}}

If &lt;math&gt; X = \mathbb{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], and if &lt;math&gt; \gamma: [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt; is an injective and continuously [[differentiable function]], then the '''length''' of &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; is defined as the quantity
:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Length}(\gamma) ~ \stackrel{\text{df}}{=} ~ \int_{a}^{b} |\gamma\,'(t)| ~ \mathrm{d}{t}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The length of a curve is independent of the [[parametrization]] &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt;.

In particular, the length &lt;math&gt; s &lt;/math&gt; of the [[graph of a function|graph]] of a continuously differentiable function &lt;math&gt; y = f(x) &lt;/math&gt; defined on a closed interval &lt;math&gt; [a,b] &lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;
s = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{1 + [f'(x)]^{2}} ~ \mathrm{d}{x}.
&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, if &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is a [[metric space]] with metric &lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt;, then we can define the length of a curve &lt;math&gt; \gamma: [a,b] \to X &lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Length}(\gamma)
~ \stackrel{\text{df}}{=} ~
\sup \!
\left( \left\{
\sum_{i = 1}^{n} d(\gamma(t_{i}),\gamma(t_{i - 1})) ~ \Bigg| ~ n \in \mathbb{N} ~ \text{and} ~ a = t_{0} &lt; t_{1} &lt; \ldots &lt; t_{n} = b
\right\} \right),
&lt;/math&gt;
where the supremum is taken over all &lt;math&gt; n \in \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt; and all partitions &lt;math&gt; t_{0} &lt; t_{1} &lt; \ldots &lt; t_{n} &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; [a, b] &lt;/math&gt;.

A '''rectifiable curve''' is a curve with [[wiktionary:finite|finite]] length. A curve &lt;math&gt; \gamma: [a,b] \to X &lt;/math&gt; is called '''natural''' (or '''unit-speed''' or '''parametrized by arc length''') if for any &lt;math&gt; t_{1},t_{2} \in [a,b] &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; t_{1} \leq t_{2} &lt;/math&gt;, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Length} \! \left( \gamma|_{[t_{1},t_{2}]} \right) = t_{2} - t_{1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt; \gamma: [a,b] \to X &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz-continuous]] function, then it is automatically rectifiable. Moreover, in this case, one can define the '''speed''' (or [[metric derivative]]) of &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt; t \in [a,b] &lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;
{\operatorname{Speed}_{\gamma}}(t) ~ \stackrel{\text{df}}{=} ~ \limsup_{[a,b] \ni s \to t} \frac{d(\gamma(s),\gamma(t))}{|s - t|}
&lt;/math&gt;
and then show that
:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Length}(\gamma) = \int_{a}^{b} {\operatorname{Speed}_{\gamma}}(t) ~ \mathrm{d}{t}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Differential geometry==
{{main|Differential geometry of curves}}
While the first examples of curves that are met are mostly plane curves (that is, in everyday words, ''curved lines'' in ''two-dimensional space''), there are obvious examples such as the [[helix]] which exist naturally in three dimensions. The needs of geometry, and also for example [[classical mechanics]] are to have a notion of curve in space of any number of dimensions. In [[general relativity]], a [[world line]] is a curve in [[spacetime]].

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[differentiable manifold]], then we can define the notion of ''differentiable curve'' in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. This general idea is enough to cover many of the applications of curves in mathematics. From a local point of view one can take &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to be [[Euclidean space]]. On the other hand, it is useful to be more general, in that (for example) it is possible to define the [[Differential geometry of curves|tangent vector]]s to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; by means of this notion of curve.

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[smooth manifold]], a ''smooth curve'' in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[smooth map]]

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma \colon I \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;.

This is a basic notion. There are less and more restricted ideas, too. If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; manifold (i.e., a manifold whose [[chart (topology)|charts]] are &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; times [[continuously differentiable]]), then a &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; curve in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is such a curve which is only assumed to be &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; times continuously differentiable).  If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an [[manifold|analytic manifold]] (i.e. infinitely differentiable and charts are expressible as [[power series]]), and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is an analytic map, then &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is said to be an ''analytic curve''.

A differentiable curve is said to be ''regular'' if its [[derivative]] never vanishes. (In words, a regular curve never slows to a stop or backtracks on itself.)  Two &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; differentiable curves

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_1 \colon I \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_2 \colon J \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;

are said to be ''equivalent'' if there is a [[bijection|bijective]] &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; map

:&lt;math&gt;p \colon J \rightarrow I&lt;/math&gt;

such that the [[inverse map]]

:&lt;math&gt;p^{-1} \colon I \rightarrow J&lt;/math&gt;

is also &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt;, and

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{2}(t) = \gamma_{1}(p(t))&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  The map &lt;math&gt;\gamma_2&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''reparametrisation'' of &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1&lt;/math&gt;; and this makes an [[equivalence relation]] on the set of all &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; differentiable curves in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  A &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; ''arc'' is an [[equivalence class]] of &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; curves under the relation of reparametrisation.

==Algebraic curve==
{{main|Algebraic curve}}
Algebraic curves are the curves considered in [[algebraic geometry]]. A plane algebraic curve is the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of the points of coordinates ''x'', ''y'' such that ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = 0, where ''f'' is a polynomial in two variables defined over some field ''F''. Algebraic geometry normally looks not only on points with coordinates in ''F'' but on all the points with coordinates in an [[algebraically closed field]] ''K''. If ''C'' is a curve defined by a polynomial ''f'' with coefficients in ''F'', the curve is said to be '''defined''' over ''F''. The points of the curve ''C'' with coordinates in a field ''G'' are said to be '''rational''' over ''G'' and can be denoted ''C''(''G'')). When ''G'' is the field of the [[rational number]]s, one simply talks of ''rational points''. For example, [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] may be restated as: ''For n'' &gt; 2, ''every rational point of the [[Fermat curve]] of degree n has a zero coordinate''.

Algebraic curves can also be space curves, or curves in a space of higher dimension, say {{math|''n''}}. They are defined as [[algebraic varieties]] of [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]] one. They may be obtained as the common solutions of at least {{math|''n''–1}} polynomial equations in {{math|''n''}} variables. If {{math|''n''–1}} polynomials are sufficient to define a curve in a space of dimension {{math|''n''}}, the curve is said to be a [[complete intersection]]. By eliminating variables (by any tool of [[elimination theory]]), an algebraic curve may be projected onto a [[plane algebraic curve]], which however may introduce new singularities such as [[cusp (singularity)|cusp]]s or [[double point]]s.

A plane curve may also be completed in a curve in the [[projective plane]]: if a curve is defined by a polynomial ''f'' of total degree ''d'', then ''w''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;''f''(''u''/''w'', ''v''/''w'') simplifies to a [[homogeneous polynomial]] ''g''(''u'', ''v'', ''w'') of degree ''d''. The values of ''u'', ''v'', ''w'' such that ''g''(''u'', ''v'', ''w'') = 0 are the homogeneous coordinates of the points of the completion of the curve in the projective plane and the points of the initial curve are those such ''w'' is not zero. An example is the [[Fermat curve]] ''u''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''v''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''w''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, which has an affine form ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1. A similar process of homogenization may be defined for curves in higher dimensional spaces

Important examples of algebraic curves are the [[conic]]s, which are nonsingular curves of degree two and [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] zero, and [[elliptic curve]]s, which are nonsingular curves of genus one studied in [[number theory]] and which have important applications to [[cryptography]].  Because algebraic curves in fields of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] zero are most often studied over the [[complex number]]s, algebraic curves in algebraic geometry may be considered as [[real number|real]] surfaces.  In particular, the nonsingular complex projective algebraic curves are called [[Riemann surface]]s.

'''Deicide''' is the killing (or the killer) of a [[deity|god]]. The concept may be used for any act of killing a god, including a [[life-death-rebirth deity]] who is killed and then [[Resurrection|resurrected]].

==Etymology==
The term deicide was coined in the 17th century from [[medieval Latin]] ''*deicidium'', from ''de-us'' "god" and ''-cidium'' "cutting, killing."

==New Testament accounts==
{{See also|Jewish deicide|Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|Pilate's court}}
According to the New Testament accounts, the Judean (or Jewish) authorities in Jerusalem, the [[Pharisees]], charged Jesus with [[blasphemy]], a [[List of capital crimes in the Torah|capital crime under biblical law]], and sought his execution. According to {{bibleverse||John|18:31}}, the Judean (Jewish) authorities claimed to lack the authority to have Jesus put to death, though it is doubtful what legal basis such a claim would have had; the [[Jesus Seminar]] historicity project notes for {{bibleverse||John|18:31}}: "''it's illegal for us:'' The accuracy of this claim is doubtful." in their ''Scholars Version''. Additionally, {{bibleverse||John|7:53-8:11}} records them asking [[Jesus]] about stoning the [[adulteress]] and {{bibleverse||Acts|6:12}} records them ordering the [[stoning]] of [[Saint Stephen]].

They brought Jesus to [[Pontius Pilate]], the Roman [[Prefect]] of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]], who was hesitant and let the people decide if Jesus were to be executed. According to the Bible, Pontius Pilate only ordered Jesus to be flogged. Washing his hands, Pilate said he would not take the blame for Jesus' death, to which the crowd replied, "[[Blood curse|His blood is upon us and our children]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|27:24-25|NAB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilate is portrayed in the Gospel accounts as a reluctant accomplice to Jesus' death. Modern scholars say it is most likely that a Roman Governor such as Pilate would have no problem in executing any leader whose followers posed a potential threat to Roman rule.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} It has also been suggested that the Gospel accounts may have downplayed the role of the Romans in Jesus' death during a time when Christianity was struggling to gain acceptance in the Roman world.&lt;ref&gt;''Anchor Bible Dictionary'' vol. 5. (1992) pg. 399-400. Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian analysis==
{{See also|Substitutionary atonement}}
The [[Catholic Church]] and other [[Christian denominations]] suggest that Jesus' death was necessary to take away the collective sin of the human race. The crucifixion is seen as an example of Christ's eternal love for mankind and as a self-sacrifice on the part of God for humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Book of Concord, [http://bookofconcord.org/creeds.php "The Three Ecumenical or Universal Creeds,"] The Book of Concord Website, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gnostic]] [[Gospel of Judas]] contends that Jesus commanded [[Judas Iscariot]] to set in motion the chain of events that would lead to his death.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,190826,00.html "Ancient Manuscript Suggests Jesus Asked Judas to Betray Him,"] Fox News Website, Thursday, April 06, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a verse from a hymn written in 1892 for use in the [[Church of England]] to call upon God to convert the Jews to Christianity:
:Though the Blood betrayed and spilt,
:: On the race entailed a doom,
: Let its virtue cleanse the guilt,
:: Melt the hardness, chase the gloom;
: Lift the veil from off their heart,

Against certain Christian movements, some of which rejected the use of [[Hebrew Scripture]], Augustine countered that God had chosen the [[Jews]] as a special people,&lt;ref&gt;[[Diarmaid MacCulloch]]. ''[[The Reformation: A History]]'' (Penguin Group, 2005) p 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and he considered the scattering of Jewish people by the Roman Empire to be a fulfillment of prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', book 18, chapter 46.&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected homicidal attitudes, quoting part of the same prophecy, namely "Slay them not, lest they should at last forget Thy law" (Psalm 59:11). Augustine, who believed Jewish people would be converted to Christianity at "the end of time", argued that God had allowed them to survive their dispersion as a warning to Christians; as such, he argued, they should be permitted to dwell in Christian lands.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J. (1999) ''The Spanish Inquisition'', Stroud, pp. 33–35, {{ISBN|0752417703}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sentiment sometimes attributed to Augustine that Christians should let the Jews "survive but not thrive" (it is repeated by author [[James Carroll (author)|James Carroll]] in his book ''Constantine's Sword'', for example)&lt;ref&gt;James Carroll, ''Constantine's Sword'' (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2002), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1864878,00.html Paula Fredriksen, interviewed by David Van Biema, "Was Saint Augustine Good for the Jews?"] in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]], December 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; is apocryphal and is not found in any of his writings.&lt;ref&gt;Fredriksen interviewed by Van Biema, "Was Saint Augustine Good for the Jews?"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1317">In [[mathematics]], '''demonic composition''' is an operation on [[binary relation]]s that is somewhat comparable to ordinary [[composition of relations]] but is robust to refinement of the relations into (partial) functions or injective relations.

Unlike ordinary composition of relations, demonic composition is not associative.

==Definition==
Suppose ''R'' is a [[binary relation]] between ''X'' and ''Y'' and ''S'' is a relation between ''Y'' and&amp;nbsp;''Z''.  Their '''right demonic composition''' ''R'' ''';'''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;rarr;&lt;/sup&gt; ''S'' is a relation between ''X'' and ''Z''.  Its graph is defined as

: &lt;math&gt;\{ (x, z) \ | \ x \, (S \circ R) \, z \wedge \forall y \in Y \ (x \, R \, y \Rightarrow y \, S \, z) \}.&lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, their '''left demonic composition''' ''R'' ''';'''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;larr;&lt;/sup&gt; ''S'' is defined by

: &lt;math&gt;\{ (x, z) \  | \ x \, (S \circ R) \, z \wedge \forall y \in Y \ (y \, S \, z \Rightarrow x \, R \, y )\}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1493">In mathematics, given a ''G''-[[torsor]] ''X'' → ''Y'' and a [[stack (mathematics)|stack]] ''F'', the '''descent along torsors''' says there is a canonical equivalence between ''F''(''Y''), the category of ''Y''-points and ''F''(''X'')&lt;sup&gt;''G''&lt;/sup&gt;, the category of ''G''-equivariant ''X''-points.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vistoli|loc=Theorem 4.46}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a basic example of [[descent (mathematics)|descent]], since it says the "equivariant data" (which is an additional data) allows one to "descend" from ''X'' to ''Y''.

When ''G'' is the [[Galois group]] of a finite [[Galois extension]] ''L''/''K'', for the ''G''-torsor &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec} L \to \operatorname{Spec} K&lt;/math&gt;, this generalizes classical '''Galois descent''' (cf. [[field of definition]]).

For example, one can take ''F'' to be the stack of quasi-coherent sheaves (in an appropriate topology). Then ''F''(''X'')&lt;sup&gt;''G''&lt;/sup&gt; consists of [[equivariant sheaf|equivariant sheaves]] on ''X''; thus, the descent in this case says that to give an equivariant sheaf on ''X'' is to give a sheaf on the quotient ''X''/''G''.

A determinancy diagram, sometimes known as a [[dependency diagram]], is a diagram which documents the [[determinancy]] or dependency between a set of data items.&lt;ref&gt;Beynon-Davies P. (2004). Database Systems 3rd Edition. Palgrave, Basingstoke, UK. {{ISBN|1-4039-1601-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determinancy diagrams are particularly used as an aid to [[database normalization]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15837">'''Explanatory style''' is a [[psychological]] attribute that indicates how people explain to themselves why they experience a particular event, either positive or negative. 

==Aspects==
===Personal===
This aspect covers the degree to which a person attributes an event to internal or external causes. An [[optimism|optimist]] might attribute a bad experience to luck whereas a [[pessimist]] might consider it his or her fault. Another person might also attribute an event to external forces in an unhealthy way (e.g. "I had no choice but to get violent.")

===Permanent===
This aspect covers characteristics considered stable versus unstable (across time). An optimist would tend to define his or her failures as unstable (I just didn't study enough for this particular test)  whereas a pessimist might think, for example, "I'm never good at tests".

===Pervasive=== 
This distinction covers global versus local and/or specific and the extent of the effect. A pessimist might, for example, think that "Everywhere there is misery" and an optimist think that, "I have had dealings mostly with honest people".

==Personality== 
People who generally tend to blame themselves for negative events, believe that such events will continue indefinitely, and let such events affect many aspects of their lives display what is called a ''[[pessimistic]] explanatory style''.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, Martin. Learned Optimism. New York, NY: Pocket Books. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, people who generally tend to blame outside forces for negative events, believe that such events will end soon, and do not let such events affect too many aspects of their lives display what is called an ''[[Learned optimism|optimistic]] explanatory style''.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, Martin. Learned Optimism. New York, NY: Pocket Books. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research has suggested a pessimistic explanatory style may be correlated with [[Clinical depression|depression]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=M. E. P. |last=Seligman |authorlink=Martin Seligman |author2=S. Nolen-Hoeksema |chapter=Explanatory style and depression |year=1987 |title=Psychopathology: An Interactional Perspective |editor=D. Magnusson and A. Ohman |location=New York |publisher=Academic Press |pages=125–139 |isbn=978-0-12-465485-3 |oclc=12554188}}&lt;/ref&gt; and physical [[illness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Leslie P. |last=Kamen |author2=M. E. P. Seligman |authorlink2=Martin Seligman  |year=1987 |title=Explanatory style and health |journal=Current Psychological Research and Reviews |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=207–218 |doi=10.1007/BF02686648}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of explanatory style encompasses a wide range of possible responses to both positive and negative occurrences, rather than a black-white difference between optimism and pessimism. Also, an individual does not necessarily show a uniform explanatory style in all aspects of life, but may exhibit varying responses to different types of events.

==Literature on attributional style==
Attributional style emerged from research on [[Depression (mood)|depression]], with [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson|Abramson]], [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] and Teasdale (1978) arguing that a characteristic way of attributing negative outcomes{{spaced ndash}}to internal, stable and global causes{{spaced ndash}}would be associated with depression in response to negative events happened to them. As a [[diathesis–stress model]] of depression,&lt;ref name=robbins1995&gt;{{Cite book|first=C. J. |last=Robins |author2=A. M. Hayes |chapter=The role of causal attributions in the prediction of depression |editor=G. M. Buchanan and [[Martin Seligman|M. E. P. Seligman]] |year=1995 |title=Explanatory Style |location=[[Hillsdale, New Jersey]] |publisher=[[Lawrence Erlbaum Associates]] |isbn=978-0-8058-0924-4 |pages=71–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; the model does not predict associations of  attributional style with depression in the absence of objective negative events (stressors). A meta-analysis of 104 empirical studies of the theory indicates that the predictions are supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=P. D. |last=Sweeney |author2=K. Anderson |author3=S. Bailey |year=1986 |title=Attributional style in depression a meta-analytic review |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=50|issue=5 |pages=974–91 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.50.5.974 |pmid=3712233}} cited in {{Cite journal|first=L. Y. |last=Abramson |author2=F. I. Metalsky |author3=L. B. Alloy |year=1989 |title=Hopelessness depression: A theory based subtype of depression |journal=[[Psychological Review]] |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=358–372 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.96.2.358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data have, however, been ambiguous, and some researchers believe that the theory is well-supported, some believe that it has not had impressive empirical support and some believe that, at least in the early days of the theory, the theory was never adequately tested.&lt;ref name=Abramson1989&gt;{{Cite journal|first=L. Y. |last=Abramson |author2=F. I. Metalsky |author3=L. B. Alloy |year=1989 |title=Hopelessness depression: A theory based subtype of depression |journal=[[Psychological Review]] |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=358–372 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.96.2.358}}&lt;/ref&gt; One factor accounting for ambiguity in research into the model is whether researchers have assessed attributions for hypothetical events or for real events. Those studies that have looked at attributions for hypothetical events have been more supportive of the model, possibly because these studies are more likely to have controlled for event severity.&lt;ref name=robbins1995/&gt;

The "[[learned helplessness]]" model formed the theoretical basis of the original Abramson, Seligman, and Teasdale statement on attributional style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=L. |last=Abrahamson |author2=Y. Seligman |author3=M. Teasdale |year=1978 |title=Learned Helplessness in Humans: Critique and Reformulation |journal=Abnormal Psychology |volume=87|issue=1 |pages=49–74 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.87.1.49 |pmid=649856}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Abramson, Metalsky and Alloy proposed a modified "hopelessness theory".&lt;ref name=Abramson1989/&gt; This distinguished hopeless depression and more circumscribed pessimism. It emphasizes the dimensions of stability and globality rather than internality, and suggests that stable and global attributions (rather than internal cause attributions) are associated with hopelessness depression. Hopelessness theory also highlights perceived importance and consequences of a negative outcome in addition to causal attributions as factors in clinical depression.

Developmentally, it has been suggested that attributional style originates in experiences of trust or lack of trust in events &lt;ref name=eisner1995&gt;{{Cite book|first=J. E. |last=Eisner |chapter=The origins of explanatory style: Trust as a determinant of pessimism and optimism |editor=G. M. Buchanan and [[Martin Seligman|M. E. P. Seligman]] |year=1995 |title=Explanatory Style |location=[[Hillsdale, New Jersey]] |publisher=[[Lawrence Erlbaum Associates]] |isbn=978-0-8058-0924-4 |pages=49–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with evidence from [[twin studies]] for some heredity basis to attributional style.,&lt;ref name=eisner1995/&gt; Eisner argues that repeated exposure to controllable events may foster an optimistic explanatory style, whereas repeated exposure to uncontrollable events may foster a negative attributional style. Trust in interpersonal relationships is argued to build an optimistic explanatory style.&lt;ref name=eisner1995/&gt;

=== Measurement ===
[[File:Liu Bates (2013) Model of Attributional Style.png|thumb|right|Liu Bates (2013) Model of Attributional Style]]
Attributional style is typically assessed using questionnaires such as the Attributional Style Questionnaire or ASQ,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=C. |last1=Peterson |author2=A. Semmel|author3=C. von Baeyer|author4=L. Abramson|author5=G. I. Metalsky |authorlink6=Martin Seligman|author6=M. E. P. Seligman]] |year=1982 |title=The Attributional Style Questionnaire |journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research |volume=6|issue=3 |pages=287–289 |doi=10.1007/BF01173577}}&lt;/ref&gt; which assesses attributions for six negative and six positive hypothetical events, the  Expanded Attributional Style Questionnaire or EASQ,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=C. |last=Peterson |author2=P. Villanova |year=1988 |title=An expanded Attributional Style Questionnaire |journal=[[Journal of Abnormal Psychology]] |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=87–89 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.97.1.87 |pmid=3351118}}&lt;/ref&gt; which assesses attributions for eighteen hypothetical negative events, and various scales that assess attributions for real events, such as the Real Events Attributional Style Questionnaire&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1521/jscp.1988.7.2-3.97|first=P. D. |last=Norman |author2=C. Antaki |year=1988 |title=Real events attributional style questionnaire |journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology |volume=7|issue=2–3 |pages=97–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Attributions Questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Elizabeth |last=Gong-Guy |author2=Constance Hammen |date=October 1980 |title=Causal perceptions of stressful events in depressed and nondepressed outpatients |journal=[[Journal of Abnormal Psychology]] |volume=89 |issue=5 |pages=662–669 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.89.5.662 |pmid=7410726}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these scales provide empirical methodology for study of attributional style, and considerable empirical data support the Abramson-Seligman-Teasdale model of depression, there has been dispute about whether this concept really exists. Cutrona, Russell and Jones, for example, found evidence for considerable cross-situational variation and temporal change of attributional style in women suffering from [[post-partum depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=C. E. |last=Cutrona |author2=D. Russell |author3=R. D. Jones |year=1984 |title=Cross-situational consistency in causal attributions: Does attributional style exist? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=47|issue=5 |pages=1043–58 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.47.5.1043}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenikou notes, however, that Cutrona, Russell and Jones found more evidence for the cross-situational consistency of stability and globalism than of internalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=A. |last=Xenikou |author2=A. Furnham |author3=M. McCarrey |year=1997 |title=Attributional style for negative events: A proposition for a more valid and reliable measaure of attributional style |journal=British Journal of Psychology |volume=88 |pages=53–69 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1997.tb02620.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; More data in support of long-term stability of attributional style has come from a diary study by Burns and Seligman.&lt;ref name=burns1989&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Melanie O. |last=Burns |author2=M. E. P. Seligman |authorlink2=Martin Seligman  |date=March 1989 |title=Explanatory style across the life span: Evidence for stability over 52 years |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=471–77 |pmid=2926642 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.56.3.471}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a technique called Content Analysis of Verbatim Explanation (CAVE),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ppc.sas.upenn.edu/cave.htm&lt;/ref&gt; these authors found stable patterns of attributional style over a long time period.&lt;ref name=burns1989/&gt;

Attributional style may be domain-specific. Using the Attributional Style Assessment Test, Anderson and colleagues found some evidence for domain-specificity  of style, for instance work-related attributions vs interpersonal attributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=C. A. |last=Anderson |author2=D. L. Jennings |author3=L. H. Arnoult |year=1988 |title=Validity and utility of the attributional style construct at a moderate level of specificity |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=55|issue=6 |pages=979–990 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.55.6.979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modelling of the items of the ASQ suggests that the positive and negative event information (e.g. getting a promotion, losing a job) and the causal nature of attributions - whether events are seen as global or local in scope, or as temporally stable or unstable, for instance - assess distinct factors. A global focus tends to emerge, for instance, independent of the valence of an event.&lt;ref name="Liu2014"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2014.03.022| title = The structure of attributional style: Cognitive styles and optimism–pessimism bias in the Attributional Style Questionnaire| journal = Personality and Individual Differences| volume = 66| pages = 79-85| year = 2014| last1 = Liu | first1 = C. | last2 = Bates | first2 = T. C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such effects are found more broadly in cognition, where they are referred to as [[Global precedence|Global versus local precedence]]. Optimistic and Pessimistic attributions emerged as independent of each other, supporting models in which these styles have distinct genetic and environmental origins.

=== Relationship to other constructs ===
Attributional style is, at least superficially, similar to [[locus of control]]. However, the locus of control is concerned with expectancies about the future while attribution style is concerned with attributions for the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=A. |last=Furnham |author2=H. Steele |year=1993 |title=Measuring locus of control: a critique of general, children's health and work related locus of control questionnaires |journal=British Journal of Psychology |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=443–79 |pmid=8298858 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1993.tb02495.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas locus of control cuts across both positive and negative outcomes, authors in the attributional style field have distinguished between a Pessimistic Explanatory Style, in which failures are attributed to internal, stable, and global factors and successes to external, unstable, and specific causes, and an Optimistic Explanatory Style, in which successes are attributed to internal, stable, and global factors and failures to external, unstable, and specific causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Gregory McClellan |last=Buchanan |author2=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6773">In [[mathematics]], an '''exponential field''' is a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] that has an extra operation on its elements which extends the usual idea of [[exponentiation]].

==Definition==

A field is an algebraic structure composed of a set of elements, ''F'', two [[binary operation]]s, addition (+) such that ''F'' forms an [[abelian group]] with identity 0&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; and multiplication (·), such that ''F'' excluding 0&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; forms an abelian group under multiplication with identity 1&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt;, and such that multiplication is distributive over addition, that is for any elements ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''F'', one has {{nowrap|1=''a'' · (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' · ''b'') + (''a'' · ''c'')}}.  If there is also a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] ''E'' that maps ''F'' into ''F'', and such that for every ''a'' and ''b'' in ''F'' one has
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}&amp;E(a+b)=E(a)\cdot E(b),\\&amp;E(0_F)=1_F \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
then ''F'' is called an exponential field, and the function ''E'' is called an exponential function on ''F''.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Wolter, ''Some results about exponential fields (survey)'', Mémoires de la S.M.F. 2&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; série, '''16''', (1984), pp.85&amp;ndash;94.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus an exponential function on a field is a [[homomorphism]] between the additive group of ''F'' and its multiplicative group.

== Trivial exponential function ==
There is a trivial exponential function on any field, namely the map that sends every element to the identity element of the field under multiplication.  Thus every field is trivially also an exponential field, so the cases of interest to mathematicians occur when the exponential function is non-trivial.

Exponential fields are sometimes required to have [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] zero as the only exponential function on a field with nonzero characteristic is the trivial one.&lt;ref name="Dries"&gt;Lou van den Dries, ''Exponential rings, exponential polynomials and exponential functions'', Pacific Journal of Mathematics, '''113''', no.1 (1984), pp.51&amp;ndash;66.&lt;/ref&gt;  To see this first note that for any element ''x'' in a field with characteristic ''p''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0,
:&lt;math&gt;1=E(0)=E(\underbrace{x+x+\ldots+x}_{p\text{ of these}})=E(x)E(x)\cdots E(x)=E(x)^p.&lt;/math&gt;
Hence, taking into account the [[Frobenius endomorphism]],
:&lt;math&gt;(E(x)-1)^p=E(x)^p-1^p=E(x)^p-1=0.\,&lt;/math&gt;
And so ''E''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 for every ''x''.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bays, Jonathan Kirby, A.J. Wilkie, ''A Schanuel property for exponentially transcendental powers'', (2008), {{arxiv|0810.4457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

* The field of real numbers '''R''', or {{nowrap|('''R''', +, ·, 0, 1)}} as it may be written to highlight that we are considering it purely as a field with addition, multiplication, and special constants zero and one, has infinitely many exponential functions.  One such function is the usual [[exponential function]], that is {{nowrap|1=''E''(''x'') = [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']]&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, since we have {{nowrap|1=''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''+''y''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;''e''&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{nowrap|1=''e''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}, as required.  Considering the [[ordered field]] '''R''' equipped with this function gives the ordered real exponential field, denoted {{nowrap|1='''R'''&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; = ('''R''', +, ·, &lt;, 0, 1, exp)}}.
* Any real number {{nowrap|''a'' &gt; 0}} gives an exponential function on '''R''', where the map {{nowrap|1=''E''(''x'') = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}} satisfies the required properties.
* Analogously to the real exponential field, there is the [[Complex number|complex]] exponential field, {{nowrap|1='''C'''&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; = ('''C''', +, ·, 0, 1, exp)}}.
* Boris Zilber constructed an exponential field ''K''&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; that, crucially, satisfies the equivalent formulation of [[Schanuel's conjecture]] with the field's exponential function.&lt;ref&gt;Boris Zilber, ''Pseudo-exponentiation on algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero'', Ann. Pure Appl. Logic, '''132''', no.1 (2005), pp.67–95.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is conjectured that this exponential field is actually '''C'''&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt;, and a proof of this fact would thus prove Schanuel's conjecture.

==Exponential rings==
The underlying set ''F'' may not be required to be a field but instead allowed to simply be a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]], ''R'', and concurrently the exponential function is relaxed to be a homomorphism from the additive group in ''R'' to the multiplicative group of [[Unit (ring theory)|units]] in ''R''.  The resulting object is called an '''exponential ring'''.&lt;ref name="Dries"/&gt;

An example of an exponential ring with a nontrivial exponential function is the ring of integers '''Z''' equipped with the function ''E'' which takes the value +1 at even integers and &amp;minus;1 at odd integers, i.e., the function &lt;math&gt;n \mapsto (-1)^n.&lt;/math&gt;  This exponential function, and the trivial one, are the only two functions on '''Z''' that satisfy the conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppina Terzo, ''Some Consequences of Schanuel's Conjecture in Exponential Rings'', Communications in Algebra, Volume 36, Issue 3 (2008), pp.1171&amp;ndash;1189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open problems==

Exponential fields are much-studied objects in [[model theory]], occasionally providing a link between it and [[number theory]] as in the case of [[Boris Zilber|Zilber]]'s work on [[Schanuel's conjecture]].  It was proved in the 1990s that '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Model complete theory|model complete]], a result known as [[Wilkie's theorem]].  This result, when combined with Khovanskiĭ's theorem on [[pfaffian function]]s, proves that '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; is also [[o-minimal]].&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Wilkie, ''Model completeness results for expansions of the ordered field of real numbers by restricted Pfaffian functions and the exponential function'', J. Amer. Math. Soc., '''9''' (1996), pp.&amp;nbsp;1051–1094.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it is known that '''C'''&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; is not model complete.&lt;ref&gt;David Marker, ''A remark on Zilber's pseudoexponentiation'', The Journal of Symbolic Logic, '''71''', no.3 (2006), pp.&amp;nbsp;791–798.&lt;/ref&gt;  The question of [[Decidability (logic)|decidability]] is still unresolved.  [[Alfred Tarski]] posed the question of the decidability of '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; and hence it is now known as [[Tarski's exponential function problem]].  It is known that if the real version of Schanuel's conjecture is true then '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; is decidable.&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Macintyre, A.J. Wilkie, ''On the decidability of the real exponential field'', Kreisel 70th Birthday Volume, (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1526">A '''feud letter''' ({{lang-de|Fehdebrief}} or ''Absagebrief'') was a [[document]] in which a [[feud]] was announced – usually with few words - in medieval Europe. The letter had to be issued three days in advance in order to be legally valid.

So that the feud did not became a case of [[murder]] and thus become punishable by law, those involved had to abide by the following rules:

# The feud, whether between [[knight]]s or between the [[nobility]] and towns, had to be initiated by a formal feud letter
# The killing of innocent parties was forbidden
# The razing of houses and laying waste to the land was allowed
# During the feud, fighting was not permitted in churches or in the home, and the parties were to be allowed go to and return from church or court without being molested.

== Examples ==
* Around 1444, the town of [[Soest, Germany|Soest]] declared war on the [[Archbishop]] of [[Cologne]] at the start of the [[Soest Feud]] with the following famous, brief feud letter:

''"Wettet, biscop Dierich van Moeres, dat wy den vesten Junker Johan can Cleve lever hebbet alls Juwe, unde wert Juwe hiermit affgesaget"''&lt;br&gt;(''"Know this, Bishop Dietrich of Moers, that we prefer the steadfast [[Junker]], John of Cleves, to you, and hereby give you notice thereof."'')

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1316">'''Finality''', in [[law]], is the concept that certain disputes must achieve a resolution from which no further [[appeal]] may be taken, and from which no collateral proceedings may be permitted to disturb that resolution. For example, in some jurisdictions, a person convicted of a crime may not sue their defence attorney for incompetence or [[legal malpractice]] if the civil [[lawsuit]] would call into question the finality of the criminal conviction.  Finality is considered to be important because, absent this there would be no certainty as to the meaning of the law, or the outcome of any legal process. The principle is an aspect of the separation of powers, that being a distinction between the executive and the judicial power. This concept was defined within NSW v Kable [2013]. In this case, the court explained that unless orders were valid until set aside, "the exercise of judicial power could yield no adjudication of right and liability to which immediate effect could be given". 

The importance of finality is the source of the concept of ''[[res judicata]]'' - that the decisions of one court are settled law, and may not be retried in another case brought in a different court.

In [[mathematics]], a '''function'''&lt;ref&gt;The words '''map''', '''mapping''', '''transformation''', '''correspondence''', and '''operator''' are often used synonymously. {{harvnb |Halmos |1970 |p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was originally the idealization of how a varying quantity depends on another quantity. For example, the position of a [[planet]] is a ''function'' of time. [[History of the function concept|Historically]], the concept was elaborated with the [[infinitesimal calculus]] at the end of the 17th century, and, until the 19th century, the functions that were considered were [[differentiable function|differentiable]] (that is, they had a high degree of regularity). The concept of function was formalized at the end of the 19th century in terms of [[set theory]], and this greatly enlarged the domains of application of the concept. 

A function is a process or a relation&lt;!-- Please, do not link to [[Binary relation]], this is not the technical meaning that is intended--&gt; that associates each element {{mvar|x}} of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] {{mvar|X}},  the ''domain'' of the function, to a single element {{mvar|y}} of another set {{mvar|Y}} (possibly the same set), the ''codomain'' of the function. If the function is called {{mvar|f}}, this relation is denoted {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''{{space|hair}}(''x'')}} (read {{mvar|f}} of {{mvar|x}}), the element {{mvar|x}} is the ''[[argument of a function|argument]]'' or ''input'' of the function, and {{mvar|y}} is the ''value of the function'', the ''output'', or the ''image'' of {{mvar|x}} by {{mvar|f}}.&lt;ref name=MacLane&gt;{{cite book | last = MacLane | first = Saunders | authorlink = Saunders MacLane | last2 = Birkhoff | first2 = Garrett | author2-link = Garrett Birkhoff | title = Algebra | publisher = Macmillan | edition = First | year = 1967 | location = New York | pages = 1–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol that is used for representing the input is the [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] of the function (one often says that {{mvar|f}} is a function of the variable {{mvar|x}}).

A function is uniquely represented by its [[graph of a function|graph]] which is the set of all [[pair (mathematics)|pairs]] {{math|(''x'', ''f''{{space|hair}}(''x''))}}. When the domain and the codomain are sets of [[number]]s, each such pair may be considered as the [[Cartesian coordinates]] of a point in the plane. In general, these points form a curve, which is also called the graph of the function. This is a useful representation of the function, which is commonly used everywhere, for example in newspapers.

Functions are widely used in [[science]], and in most fields of mathematics. Their role is so important that it has been said that they are "the central objects of investigation" in most fields of mathematics.{{sfn |Spivak |2008 |p=39}}

| caption2  = This diagram, representing the set of pairs {(1,D), (2,B), (2,C)}, does ''not'' define a function. One reason is that 2 is the first element in more than one ordered pair, {{nowrap|(2, B)}} and {{nowrap|(2, C)}}, of this set.  Two other reasons, also sufficient by themselves, is that neither 3 nor 4 are first elements (input) of any ordered pair therein.
}}
Intuitively, a function is a process that associates to each element of a set {{math|''X''}} a unique element of a set {{math|''Y''}}.

Formally, a function {{math|''f''}} from a set {{math|''X''}} to a set {{math|''Y''}} is defined by a set {{mvar|G}} of ordered pairs {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} such that {{math|''x'' ∈ ''X''}}, {{math|''y'' ∈ ''Y''}}, and every element of {{math|''X''}} is the first component of exactly one ordered pair in {{mvar|G}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamilton |first=A. G. |title=Numbers, sets, and axioms: the apparatus of mathematics |page=83 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-24509-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXfmTHXvRXMC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=%22function+is+a+relation%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, for every {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''X''}}, there is exactly one element {{math|''y''}} such that the ordered pair {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} belongs to the set of pairs defining the function {{math|''f''}}. The set {{mvar|G}} is called the [[graph of a function|graph of the function]]. Formally speaking, it may be identified with the function, but this hides the usual interpretation of a function as a process. Therefore, in common usage, the function is generally distinguished from its graph. Functions are also called ''[[Map (mathematics)|map]]s'' or ''mappings''. However, some authors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=T. M. Apostol|title=Mathematical Analysis|year=1981|publisher=Addison-Wesley|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; reserve the word ''mapping'' to the case where the codomain ''Y'' belongs explicitly to the definition of the function. In this sense, the graph of the mapping recovers the function as the set of pairs.

In the definition of function, {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} are respectively called the ''domain'' and the ''codomain'' of the function {{mvar|f}}. If {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} belongs to the set defining {{mvar|f}}, then {{mvar|y}} is the ''image'' of {{mvar|x}} under {{mvar|f}}, or the ''value'' of {{mvar|f}} applied to the ''argument'' {{mvar|x}}. Especially in the context of numbers, one says also that {{mvar|y}} is the value of {{mvar|f}} for the ''value {{mvar|x}} of its variable'', or, still shorter, {{mvar|y}} is the ''value of'' {{mvar|f}} ''of'' {{mvar|x}}, denoted as {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}}.

The domain and codomain are not always explicitly given when a function is defined, and, without some (possibly difficult) computation, one knows only that the domain is contained in a larger set. Typically, this occurs in [[mathematical analysis]], where "a function {{nowrap|from {{mvar|X}} to {{mvar|Y}} "}} often refers to a function that may have a proper subset of {{mvar|X}} as domain. For example, a "function from the reals to the reals" may refer to a [[real-valued function|real-valued]] function of a [[function of a real variable|real variable]], and this phrase does not mean that the domain of the function is the whole set of the [[real number]]s, but only that the domain is a set of real numbers that contains a non-empty [[open interval]]. For example, if {{mvar|f}} is a function that has the real numbers as domain and codomain, then a function mapping the value {{mvar|x}} to the value &lt;math&gt;g(x)=\tfrac 1{f(x)}&lt;/math&gt; is a function {{mvar|g}} from the reals to the reals, whose domain is the set of the reals {{mvar|x}}, such that {{math|''f''(''x'') ≠ 0}}. In many cases, the exact domains are difficult to determine, but this is rarely a problem for working with such functions.

The [[range (mathematics)|range]] of a function is the set of the images of all elements in the domain. However, ''range'' is sometimes used as a synonym of codomain, generally in old textbooks.

===Relational approach===
Any subset of the Cartesian product of a domain &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and a codomain &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is said to define a [[binary relation]] &lt;math&gt;R\subseteq (X\times Y)&lt;/math&gt; between these two sets. It is immediate that an arbitrary relation may contain pairs that violate the necessary conditions for a function, given above. 

A [[binary relation#univalent|univalent relation]] is a relation such that
:&lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in R\; \land \;(x,z) \in R\quad\Rightarrow \quad y=z.&lt;/math&gt;
Univalent relations may be identified to functions whose domain is a subset of {{mvar|X}}.

A [[binary relation#left-total|left-total relation]] is a relation such that 
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in X \;\exists y \in Y\colon (x,y)\in R.&lt;/math&gt;
Formal functions may be strictly identified to relations that are both univalent and left total. Violating the left-totality is similar to giving a convenient encompassing set instead of the true domain, as explained above.

Various properties of functions and function composition may be reformulated in the language of relations. For example, a function is [[injective function|injective]] if the [[converse relation]] &lt;math&gt;R^{\text{T}}\subseteq (Y\times X)&lt;/math&gt; is univalent, where the converse relation is defined as &lt;math&gt;R^{\text{T}} = \{(y,x)\colon (x,y) \in R\}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=RM&gt;[[Gunther Schmidt]]( 2011) ''Relational Mathematics'', Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications, vol. 132, sect 5.1 Functions, pages 49 to 60, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{ISBN|978-0-521-76268-7}}  [http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/mathematics/logic-categories-and-sets/relational-mathematics?format=HB CUP blurb for ''Relational Mathematics'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notation==

There are various standard ways for denoting functions. The most commonly used notation is functional notation, which defines the function using an equation that gives the names of the function and the argument explicitly.  This gives rise to a subtle point, often glossed over in elementary treatments of functions: ''functions'' are distinct from their ''values''.  Thus, a function {{math|''f''}} should be distinguished from its value {{math|''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}} at the value {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} in its domain.  To some extent, even working mathematicians will conflate the two in informal settings for convenience, and to avoid the use of pedantic language.  However, strictly speaking, it is an [[abuse of notation]] to write "let &lt;math&gt;f\colon \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be the function {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} ", since {{math|''f''(''x'')}} and {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} should both be understood as the ''value'' of ''f'' at ''x'', rather than the function itself.  Instead, it is correct, though pedantic, to write "let &lt;math&gt;f\colon \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be the function defined by the equation {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,}} valid for all real values of {{math|''x''}} ".  

This distinction in language and notation becomes important in cases where functions themselves serve as inputs for other functions.  (A function taking another function as an input is termed a ''[[Functional (mathematics)|functional]]''.)  Other approaches to denoting functions, detailed below, avoid this problem but are less commonly used.

===Functional notation===
First used by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1734,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=19 |title=Calculus of a Single Variable |author=Ron Larson, Bruce H. Edwards |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2010 |isbn=9780538735520}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is often useful to use a symbol for denoting a function. This symbol consists generally of a single letter in [[italic font]], most often the lower-case letters {{math|''f'', ''g'', ''h''}}. Some widely used functions are represented by a symbol consisting of several letters (usually two or three, generally an abbreviation of their name). By convention, the symbol for standard functions is set in [[roman type]], such as "{{math|sin}}" for the [[sine function]], in contrast to functions defined on an ''ad hoc'' basis.

The notation (read: "{{mvar|y}} equals {{mvar|f}} of {{mvar|x}}")
:&lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; 
means that the pair {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} belongs to the set of pairs defining the function {{mvar|f}}. If {{mvar|X}} is the domain of {{mvar|f}}, the set of pairs defining the function is thus, using [[set-builder notation]],
:&lt;math&gt;\{(x, f(x))\colon x\in X\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Often, a definition of the function is given by what ''f'' does to the explicit argument ''x.''  For example, a function ''f'' can be defined by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sin(x^2+1)&lt;/math&gt;

for all real numbers ''x.''  In this example, ''f'' can be thought of as the [[Function (Mathematics)#Function composition|composite]] of several simpler functions: squaring, adding 1, and taking the sine.  However, only the sine function has a common explicit symbol (sin), while the combination of squaring and then adding 1 is described by the polynomial expression &lt;math&gt;x^2+1&lt;/math&gt;.  In order to explicitly reference functions such as squaring or adding 1 without introducing new function names (e.g., by defining function ''g'' and ''h'' by &lt;math&gt;g(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h(x)=x+1&lt;/math&gt;), one of the methods below (arrow notation or dot notation) could be used.  

Sometimes the parentheses of functional notation are omitted when the symbol denoting the function consists of several characters and no ambiguity may arise.  For example, &lt;math&gt;\sin x&lt;/math&gt; can be written instead of &lt;math&gt;\sin(x).&lt;/math&gt;

===Arrow notation===
For explicitly expressing domain {{math|''X''}} and the codomain {{math|''Y''}} of a function {{math|''f''}}, the arrow notation is often used (read: {{nowrap|"the function {{math|''f''}} from {{mvar|X}} to {{mvar|Y}}"}} or {{nowrap|"the function {{math|''f''}} mapping elements of  {{mvar|X}} to elements of {{mvar|Y}}"}}):

:&lt;math&gt;f\colon X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;X ~ \stackrel{f}{\to} ~ Y.&lt;/math&gt;

This is often used in relation with the arrow notation for elements (read: "{{mvar|f}} maps {{mvar|x}} to {{math|''f''{{space|hair}}(''x'')}}"), often stacked immediately below the arrow notation giving the function symbol, domain, and codomain: 
:&lt;math&gt;x\mapsto f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if a multiplication is defined on a set {{mvar|X}}, then the [[square function]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sqr}&lt;/math&gt; on {{mvar|X}} is unambiguously defined by (read: "the function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sqr}&lt;/math&gt; from {{mvar|X}} to {{mvar|X}} that maps {{mvar|x}} to {{math|''x'' ⋅ ''x''}}")
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\operatorname{sqr}\colon X &amp;\to X\\
x &amp;\mapsto x\cdot x,\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

the latter line being more commonly written 
:&lt;math&gt;x\mapsto x^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Often, the expression giving the function symbol, domain and codomain is omitted.  Thus, the arrow notation is useful for avoiding introducing a symbol for a function that is defined, as it is often the case, by a formula expressing the value of the function in terms of its argument.  As a common application of the arrow notation, suppose &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\times X\to Y;\;(x,t) \mapsto f(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; is a two-argument function, and we want to refer to a [[Partial application|partially applied function]] &lt;math&gt;X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; produced by fixing the second argument to the value {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} without introducing a new function name.  The map in question could be denoted &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto f(x,t_0)&lt;/math&gt; using the arrow notation for elements.  Note that the expression &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto f(x,t_0)&lt;/math&gt; (read: "the map taking {{math|''x''}} to &lt;math&gt;f(x,t_0)&lt;/math&gt;") represents this new function with just one argument, whereas the expression &lt;math&gt;f(x_0,t_0)&lt;/math&gt; refers to the value of the function {{math|''f''}} at the {{nowrap|point &lt;math&gt;(x_0,t_0)&lt;/math&gt;.}}

===Index notation===

Index notation is often used instead of functional notation. That is, instead of writing {{math|''f''{{space|hair}}(''x'')}}, one writes &lt;math&gt;f_x.&lt;/math&gt; 

This is typically the case for functions whose domain is the set of the [[natural number]]s. Such a function is called a [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]], and, in this case the element &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; is called the {{mvar|n}}th element of sequence.

The index notation is also often used for distinguishing some variables called [[parameter]]s from the "true variables". In fact, parameters are specific variables that are considered as being fixed during the study of a problem.  For example, the map &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto f(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; (see above) would be denoted &lt;math&gt;f_t&lt;/math&gt; using index notation, if we define the collection of maps &lt;math&gt;f_t&lt;/math&gt; by the formula &lt;math&gt;f_t(x)=f(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x,t\in X&lt;/math&gt;.

===Dot notation===

In the notation 
&lt;math&gt;x\mapsto f(x),&lt;/math&gt;
the symbol {{mvar|x}} does not represent any value, it is simply a [[placeholder name|placeholder]] meaning that, if {{mvar|x}} is replaced by any value on the left of the arrow, it should be replaced by the same value on the right of the arrow. Therefore, {{mvar|x}} may be replaced by any symbol, often an [[interpunct]] "{{math| ⋅ }}". This may be useful for distinguishing the function {{math|''f''{{space|hair}}(⋅)}} from its value {{math|''f''{{space|hair}}(''x'')}} at {{mvar|x}}. 

For example, &lt;math&gt; a(\cdot)^2&lt;/math&gt; may stand for the function &lt;math&gt; x\mapsto ax^2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \int_a^{\, (\cdot)} f(u)\,du&lt;/math&gt; may stand for a function defined by an integral with variable upper bound: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x\mapsto \int_a^x f(u)\,du&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Specialized notations ===
There are other, specialized notations for functions in sub-disciplines of mathematics.  For example, in [[linear algebra]] and [[functional analysis]], [[linear form]]s and the [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vectors]] they act upon are denoted using a [[dual pair]] to show the underlying [[Duality (mathematics)|duality]].  This is similar to the use of [[bra–ket notation]] in quantum mechanics.  In [[Mathematical logic|logic]] and the [[theory of computation]], the function notation of [[lambda calculus]] is used to explicitly express the basic notions of function [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] and [[Function application|application]].  In [[category theory]] and [[homological algebra]], networks of functions are described in terms of how they and their compositions [[Commutative property|commute]] with each other using [[commutative diagram]]s that extend and generalize the arrow notation for functions described above.

==Specifying a function==
According to the definition of a function, a specific function is, in general, defined by associating to every element of its domain one element of its codomain. When the domain and the codomain are sets of numbers, this association may take the form of a computation taking as input any element of the domain and producing an output in the codomain. This computation may be described by a formula. (This is the starting point of [[algebra]], where many similar numerical computations can be replaced by a single formula that describes these computations by means of [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] that represent computation inputs as unspecified numbers). This type of specification of a function frequently uses previously defined auxiliary functions. 

For example, the function {{mvar|f}} from the [[real number|real]]s to the reals, defined by the formula 
&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sqrt{1+x^2},&lt;/math&gt;
employs, as auxiliary functions, the [[square function]] (mapping all the reals to the non-negative reals), the [[square root function]] (mapping the non-negative reals to the non-negative reals), and the addition of real numbers. The whole set of real numbers may be taken as the domain of {{mvar|f}}, even though the domain of the square root function is restricted to the non-negative real numbers; the image of {{mvar|f}} consists of the reals that are not less than one.

A computation that  defines a function may often be described by an [[algorithm]], and any kind of algorithm may be used. Sometimes, the definition of a function may involve elements or properties that can be defined, but not computed. For example, if one considers the set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal P&lt;/math&gt; of the programs in a given programming language that take an integer as input. The ''terminating function'' is the function that returns 1 if a program of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal P&lt;/math&gt; runs forever when executed on a given integer input, and returns 0 otherwise. It is a basic theorem of [[computability theory]] that there does not exist an algorithm for computing this function. More generally, computability theory is the study of  [[computable function]]s, that is, the functions that can  be computed by an algorithm.

The above ways of defining functions define them "pointwise", that is, each value is defined independently of the other values. This is not necessarily the case.

When the domain of a function is the set of nonnegative integers or, more generally, when the domain is a [[well order|well ordered set]], a function may be defined by [[induction (mathematics)|induction]] or [[recursion]], meaning (roughly) that the calculation of the value of the function for some given input requires values of the function for ''lesser'' inputs. For example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]] is a function from the natural numbers into themselves that is defined by two starting values and a formula, recurring to the two immediately preceding arguments (see [[Function_(mathematics)#Index notation|above]] for the use of indices for the argument of a function): 
:&lt;math&gt;F_0=0,\quad F_1=1, \quad\text{and}\quad F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}\quad \text{for } n&gt;1.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[calculus]], the usual functions considered have extensive regularities. That is, the value of the function at a point is related to the values of the function at neighboring points. This allows defining them by [[functional equation]]s (for example, the [[gamma function]] is the unique [[meromorphic function]] such that &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(1)=1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(z+1)=z\Gamma(z)&lt;/math&gt; for any complex {{mvar|z}} that is not a non-positive integer), by [[differential equation]]s (for example, the [[natural logarithm]] is the solution of the differential equation &lt;math&gt;\frac{d(\ln x)}{dx}=\frac 1x&lt;/math&gt; such that {{math|1=ln(1) = 0}}), by [[integral equations]] or by [[analytic continuation]].

==Representing a function==

As functions may be complicated objects, it is often useful to draw the [[graph of a function]] for getting a global view of its properties. Some functions may also represented [[histogram]]s

===Graph===
{{main|Graph of a function}}

Given a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y,&lt;/math&gt; its ''graph'' is, formally, the set 

:&lt;math&gt;G=\{(x,y)\colon x\in X \text{ and } y=f(x)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the frequent case where {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} are subsets of the [[real number]]s (or may be identified to such subsets), an element &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in G&lt;/math&gt; may be identified with the point of coordinates {{math|''x'', ''y''}} in the [[Cartesian plane]]. Marking these points provides a drawing, generally a curve, that is also called the ''graph of the function''. For example the graph of the [[square function]]

:&lt;math&gt;x\mapsto x^2&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[parabola]] that consists of all points of coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x, x^2)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x\in \R.&lt;/math&gt;

It is possible to draw effectively the graph of a function only if the function is sufficiently regular, that is, either if the function is [[differentiable function|differentiable]] (or [[piecewise]] differentiable) or if its domain may be identified with the integers or a subset of the integers.

If either the domain or the codomain of the function is a subset of &lt;math&gt;\R^n,&lt;/math&gt; the graph is a subset of a [[Cartesian space]] of higher dimension, and various technics have been developed for drawing it, including the use of colors for representing one of the dimensions.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

===Histogram===
{{main|Histogram}}

Histograms are often used for representing functions whose domain is finite, or is the [[natural number]]s or the [[integer]]s. In this case, an element {{mvar|x}} of the domain is represented by an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] of the {{mvar|x}}-axis, and a point {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} of the graph is represented by a [[rectangle]] with basis the interval corresponding to {{mvar|x}} and height {{mvar|y}}.

In [[statistic]], histogram are often used for representing very irregular functions. For example, for representing the function that associates his weight to each member of some population, one draws the histogram of the function that associates to each weight interval the number of people, whose weights belong to this interval. 

There are many variants of this method, see [[Histogram]] for details.

==General properties==

This section describes general properties of functions, that are independent of specific properties of the domain and the codomain.

===Canonical functions===
Some functions are uniquely defined by their domain and codomain, and are sometimes called ''canonical'': {{anchor|Empty function}}

* For every set {{mvar|X}}, there is a unique function, called the '''empty function''' from the [[empty set]] to {{mvar|X}}. This function is not interesting by itself, but useful for simplifying statements, similarly as the [[empty sum]] (equal to 0) and the [[empty product]] equal to 1.
* For every set {{mvar|X}} and every [[singleton set]] {{math|{''s''}{{void}}}}, there is a unique function, called the '''canonical surjection''', from {{mvar|X}} to {{math|{''s''}{{void}}}}, which maps to {{mvar|s}} every element of {{mvar|X}}. This is a surjection (see below), except if {{mvar|X}} is the empty set.
* Given a function &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y,&lt;/math&gt; the '''canonical surjection''' of {{mvar|f}} onto its ''image'' &lt;math&gt;f(X)=\{f(x)\mid x\in X\}&lt;/math&gt; is the function from {{mvar|X}} to {{math|''f''(''X'')}} that maps {{mvar|x}} to {{math|''f''(''x'')}}
* For every [[subset]] {{mvar|X}} of a set {{mvar|Y}}, the '''[[canonical injection]]''' of {{mvar|X}} into {{mvar|Y}} is the injective (see below) function that maps every element of {{mvar|X}} to itself.
* The [[identity function]] of {{mvar|X}}, often denoted by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{id}_X&lt;/math&gt; is the canonical injection of {{mvar|X}} into itself.

===Equality of functions===
Two functions ''f'' and ''g'' are equal if their domain and codomain sets agree and their output values agree on the whole domain. Formally, ''f''=''g'' if ''f''(''x'')=''g''(''x'') for all ''x''∈''X'', where ''f'':''X''→''Y'' and ''g'':''X''→''Y''.

===Function composition===
{{Main|Function composition}}

Given two functions &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\colon Y\to Z&lt;/math&gt; such that the domain of {{mvar|g}} is the codomain of {{mvar|f}}, their ''composition'' is the function &lt;math&gt;g \circ f\colon X \rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt; defined by
:&lt;math&gt;(g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x)).&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the value of &lt;math&gt;g \circ f&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by first applying {{math|''f''}} to {{math|''x''}} to obtain {{math|1=''y'' =''f''(''x'')}} and then applying {{math|''g''}} to the result {{mvar|y}} to obtain {{math|1=''g''(''y'') = ''g''(''f''(''x''))}}. In the notation the function that is applied first is always written on the right.

The composition &lt;math&gt;g\circ f&lt;/math&gt; is an [[operation (mathematics)|operation]] on functions that is defined only if the codomain of the first function is the domain of the second one. Even when both &lt;math&gt;g \circ f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f \circ g&lt;/math&gt; satisfy these conditions, the composition is not necessarily [[commutative property|commutative]], that is, the functions &lt;math&gt;g \circ f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f \circ g&lt;/math&gt; need not be equal, but may deliver different values for the same argument. For example, let {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|1=''g''(''x'') = ''x'' + 1}}, then &lt;math&gt;g(f(x))=x^2+1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f(g(x)) = (x+1)^2&lt;/math&gt; agree just for &lt;math&gt;x=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The function composition is [[associative property|associative]] in the sense that, if one of &lt;math&gt;(h\circ g)\circ f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h\circ (g\circ f)&lt;/math&gt; is defined, then the other is also defined, and they are equal. Thus, one writes 
:&lt;math&gt;h\circ g\circ f = (h\circ g)\circ f = h\circ (g\circ f).&lt;/math&gt;

The [[identity function]]s &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{id}_X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{id}_Y&lt;/math&gt; are respectively a [[right identity]] and a [[left identity]] for functions from {{mvar|X}} to {{mvar|Y}}. That is, if {{mvar|f}} is a function with domain {{mvar|X}}, and codomain {{mvar|Y}}, one has 
&lt;math&gt;f\circ \operatorname{id}_X = \operatorname{id}_Y \circ f = f.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Image and preimage===
{{Main|Image (mathematics)}}
Let &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y.&lt;/math&gt; The ''image'' by {{mvar|f}} of an element {{mvar|x}} of the domain {{mvar|X}} is {{math|''f''(''x'')}}. If {{math|''A''}} is any subset of {{math|''X''}}, then the ''image'' of {{mvar|A}} by {{mvar|f}}, denoted {{math|''f''(''A'')}} is the subset of the codomain {{math|''Y''}} consisting of all images of elements of {{mvar|A}}, that is,
:&lt;math&gt;f(A)=\{f(x)\mid x\in A\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The ''image'' of {{math|''f''}} is the image of the whole domain, that is {{math|''f''(''X'')}}. It is also called the [[range (mathematics)|range]] of {{mvar|f}}, although the term may also refer to the codomain.&lt;ref name = "standard"&gt;''Quantities and Units - Part 2: Mathematical signs and symbols to be used in the natural sciences and technology'', page 15.  ISO 80000-2 (ISO/IEC 2009-12-01)&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the ''[[inverse image]]'', or ''[[preimage]]'' by {{mvar|f}} of a subset {{math|''B''}} of the codomain {{math|''Y''}} is the subset of the domain {{math|''X''}} consisting of all elements of {{math|''X''}} whose images belong to {{math|''B''}}. It is denoted by &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(B).&lt;/math&gt;  That is 
:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(B) = \{x \in X \mid f(x) \in B\}.&lt;/math&gt;
For example, the preimage of {4, 9} under the [[square function]] is the set {−3,−2,2,3}. 

By definition of a function, the image of an element {{math|''x''}} of the domain is always a single element of the codomain. However, the preimage of a single element {{mvar|y}}, denoted &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x),&lt;/math&gt; may be [[empty set|empty]] or contain any number of elements. For example, if {{mvar|f}} is the function from the integers to themselves that map every integer to 0, then {{math|1=''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(0) = '''Z'''}}. 

If &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is a function, {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} are subsets of {{math|''X''}}, and {{math|''C''}} and {{math|''D''}} are subsets of {{math|''Y''}}, then one has the following properties:
* &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq B \Longrightarrow f(A)\subseteq f(B)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;C\subseteq D \Longrightarrow f^{-1}(C)\subseteq f^{-1}(D)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq f^{-1}(f(A))&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;C \supseteq f(f^{-1}(C))&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f(f^{-1}(f(A)))=f(A)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(f(f^{-1}(C)))=f^{-1}(C)&lt;/math&gt;

The preimage by {{mvar|f}} of an element {{mvar|y}} of the codomain is sometimes called, in some contexts, the [[fiber (mathematics)|fiber]] of {{math|''y''}} under {{mvar|''f''}}.  

If a function {{mvar|f}} has an inverse (see below), this inverse is denoted &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt; In this case &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(C)&lt;/math&gt; may denote either the image by &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; or the preimage by {{mvar|f}} of {{mvar|C}}. This is not a problem, as these sets are equal. The notation &lt;math&gt;f(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(C)&lt;/math&gt; may be ambiguous in the case of sets that contain some subsets as elements, such as &lt;math&gt;\{x, \{x\}\}.&lt;/math&gt; In this case, some care may be needed, for example, by using square brackets &lt;math&gt;f[A], f^{-1}[C]&lt;/math&gt; for images and preimages of subsets, and ordinary parentheses for images and preimages of elements.

===Injective, surjective and bijective functions===

Let &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; be a function.

The function {{mvar|f}} is ''[[injective function|injective]]'' (or ''one-to-one'', or is an ''injection'') if {{math|''f''(''a'') &amp;ne; ''f''(''b'')}} for any two different elements {{math|''a''}} and {{mvar|''b''}} of {{mvar|X}}. Equivalently, {{mvar|f}} is injective if, for any &lt;math&gt;y\in Y,&lt;/math&gt; the preimage &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y)&lt;/math&gt; contains at most one element. An empty function is always injective. If {{mvar|X}} is not the empty set, and if, as usual, the [[axiom of choice]] is assumed, then {{mvar|f}} is injective if and only if there exists a function &lt;math&gt;g\colon y\to X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g\circ f=\operatorname{id}_X,&lt;/math&gt; that is, if {{mvar|f}} has a [[left inverse function|left inverse]]. The axiom of choice is needed, because, if {{mvar|f}} is injective, one defines {{mvar|g}} by &lt;math&gt;g(y)=x&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;y=f(x),&lt;/math&gt; and by &lt;math&gt;g(y)=x_0&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;y\not\in f(X),&lt;/math&gt; where  &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is an ''arbitrarily chosen'' element of {{mvar|X}}.

The function {{mvar|f}} is ''[[surjective]]'' (or ''onto'', or is a ''surjection'') if the range equals the codomain, that is, if {{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''Y''}}. In other words, the preimage &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y)&lt;/math&gt; of every &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty. If, as usual, the axiom of choice is assumed, then {{mvar|f}} is surjective if and only if there exists a function &lt;math&gt;g\colon y\to X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f\circ g=\operatorname{id}_Y,&lt;/math&gt; that is, if {{mvar|f}} has a [[left inverse function|right inverse]]. The axiom of choice is needed, because, if {{mvar|f}} is injective, one defines {{mvar|g}} by &lt;math&gt;g(y)=x,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is an ''arbitrarily chosen'' element of &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y).&lt;/math&gt;

The function {{mvar|f}} is ''[[bijective]]'' (or is ''bijection'' or a ''one-to-one correspondence'') if it is both injective and surjective. That is {{mvar|f}} is bijective if, for any &lt;math&gt;y\in Y,&lt;/math&gt; the preimage &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y)&lt;/math&gt; contains exactly one element. The function {{mvar|f}} is bijective if and only if it admits an [[inverse function]], that is a function &lt;math&gt;g\colon y\to X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g\circ f=\operatorname{id}_X,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f\circ g=\operatorname{id}_Y.&lt;/math&gt; (Contrarily to the case of injections and surjections, this does not require the axiom of choice.)

Every function &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; may be [[factorization|factorized]] as the composition {{math|''i'' ∘ ''s''}} of a surjection followed by an injection, where {{mvar|s}} is the canonical surjection of {{mvar|X}} onto {{math|''f''(''X'')}}, and {{mvar|i}} is the canonical injection of {{math|''f''(''X'')}} into {{mvar|Y}}. This is the ''canonical factorization'' of {{mvar|f}}.

"One-to-one" and "onto" are terms that were more common in the older English language literature; "injective", "surjective", and "bijective" were originally coined as French words in the second quarter of the 20th century by the [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki group]] and imported into English.  As a word of caution, "a one-to-one function" is one that is injective, while a "one-to-one correspondence" refers to a bijective function.  Also, the statement "{{math|''f''}} maps {{math|''X''}} ''onto'' {{math|''Y''}}" differs from "{{math|''f''}}  maps {{math|''X''}} ''into'' {{math|''B''}}" in that the former implies that {{math|''f''}} is surjective), while the latter makes no assertion about the nature of {{math|''f''}} the mapping.  In a complicated reasoning, the one letter difference can easily be missed. Due to the confusing nature of this older terminology, these terms have declined in popularity relative to the Bourbakian terms, which have also the advantage to be more symmetrical.

===Restriction and extension{{anchor|Restrictions and extensions}}===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Subgroup]], [[Restriction]], [[Quadratic form]] --&gt;
{{main|Restriction (mathematics)}}
If &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is a function, and {{mvar|S}} is a subset of {{mvar|X}}, then the ''restriction'' of {{mvar|f}} to {{mvar|S}}, denoted {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;{{!}}''S''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, is the function from {{mvar|S}} to {{mvar|Y}} that is defined by 
:&lt;math&gt;f_{|S}(x)= f(x)\quad \text{for all } x\in S.&lt;/math&gt;

This often used for define partial inverse functions: if there is a subset {{mvar|S}} of a function {{mvar|f}} such that {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;{{!}}''S''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is injective, then the canonical surjection of {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;{{!}}''S''&lt;/sub&gt;}} on its image {{math|1=''f''&lt;sub&gt;{{!}}''S''&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'') = ''f''(''S'')}} is a bijection, which has an inverse function from {{math|''f''(''S'')}} to {{mvar|S}}. This is in this way that [[inverse trigonometric functions]] are defined. The [[cosine function]], for example, is injective, when restricted to the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|(–0, {{pi}})}}; the image of this restriction is the interval {{math|(–1, 1)}}; this defines thus an inverse function from {{math|(–1, 1)}} to {{math|(–0, {{pi}})}}, which is called [[arccosine]] and denoted {{math|arccos}}.

Function restriction may also be used for "gluing" functions together: let &lt;math&gt;\textstyle X=\bigcup_{i\in I}U_i&lt;/math&gt; be the decomposition of {{mvar|X}} as a [[set union|union]] of subsets. Suppose that a function &lt;math&gt;f_i\colon U_i\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is defined on each &lt;math&gt;U_i,&lt;/math&gt; such that, for each pair of indices, the restrictions of &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;U_i\cap U_j&lt;/math&gt; are equal. Then, this defines a unique function &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f_{|U_i} =f_i&lt;/math&gt; for every {{mvar|i}}. This is generally in this way that functions on [[manifold]]s are defined.

An ''extension'' of a  function {{mvar|f}} is a function {{mvar|g}} such that {{mvar|f}} is a restriction of {{mvar|g}}. A typical use of this concept is the process of [[analytic continuation]], that allows extending functions whose domain is a small part of the [[complex plane]] to functions whose domain is almost the whole complex plane.

Here is another classical example of a function extension that is encountered when studying [[homography|homographies]] of the [[real line]]. An ''homography'' is a function &lt;math&gt;h(x)=\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}&lt;/math&gt; such that {{math|''ad'' – ''bc'' ≠ 0}}. Its domain is the set of all [[real number]]s different from &lt;math&gt;-d/c,&lt;/math&gt; and its image is the set of all real numbers different from &lt;math&gt;a/c.&lt;/math&gt; If one extends the real line to the [[projectively extended real line]] by adding {{math|∞}} to the real numbers, one may extend {{mvar|h}} for being a bijection of the extended real line to itself, by setting &lt;math&gt;h(\infty)=a/c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h(-d/c)=\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

==Multivariate function {{anchor|MULTIVARIATE_FUNCTION}}==
[[File:Binary operations as black box.svg|thumb|A binary operation is a typical example of a bivariate, function which assigns to each pair &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; the result &lt;math&gt;x\circ y&lt;/math&gt;.]]
A '''multivariate function''', or '''function of several variables''' is a function that depends on several arguments. Such functions are commonly encountered. For example, the position of a car on a road is a function of the time and its speed.

More formally, a function of {{mvar|n}} variables is a function whose domain is a set of [[tuple|{{mvar|n}}-tuples]].
For example, multiplication of [[integer]]s is a function of two variables, or '''bivariate function''', whose domain is the set of all pairs (2-tuples) of integers, and whose codomain is the set of integers. The same is true for every [[binary operation]]. More generally, every [[mathematical operation]] is defined as a multivariate function.

The [[Cartesian product]] &lt;math&gt;X_1\times\cdots\times X_n&lt;/math&gt; of {{mvar|n}} sets &lt;math&gt;X_1, \ldots, X_n&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all {{mvar|n}}-tuples &lt;math&gt;(x_1, \ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_i\in X_i&lt;/math&gt; for every {{mvar|i}} with &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq n&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, a function of {{mvar|n}} variables is a function
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon U\to Y,&lt;/math&gt;
where the domain {{mvar|U}} has the form
:&lt;math&gt;U\subseteq X_1\times\cdots\times X_n.&lt;/math&gt;
When using function notation, one usually omits the parentheses surrounding tuples, writing &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;f((x_1,x_2)).&lt;/math&gt;

In the case where all the &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; are equal to the set &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; of [[real number]]s, one has a [[function of several real variables]]. If the &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; are equal to the set &lt;math&gt;\C&lt;/math&gt; of [[complex number]]s, one has a [[function of several complex variables]].

It is common to also consider functions whose codomain is a product of sets. For example, [[Euclidean division]] maps every pair {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} of integers with {{math|''b'' ≠ 0}} to a pair of integers called the ''quotient'' and the ''remainder'':
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \text{Euclidean division}\colon\quad \Z\times (\Z\setminus \{0\}) &amp;\to \Z\times\Z\\
  (a,b) &amp;\mapsto (\operatorname{quotient}(a,b),\operatorname{remainder}(a,b)).
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
The codomain may also be a [[vector space]]. In this case, one talks of a [[vector-valued function]]. If the domain is contained in a [[Euclidean space]], or more generally a [[manifold]], a vector-valued function is often called a [[vector field]].

==In calculus==

The idea of function, starting in the 17th century, was fundamental to the new [[infinitesimal calculus]] (see [[History of the function concept]]). At that time, only [[real-valued function|real-valued]] functions of a [[function of a real variable|real variable]] were considered, and all functions were assumed to be [[smooth function|smooth]]. But the definition was soon extended to [[#Multivariate function|functions of several variables]] and to [[function of a complex variable]].  In the second half of 19th century, the mathematically rigorous definition of a function was introduced, and functions with arbitrary domains and codomains were defined. 

Functions are now used throughout all areas of mathematics.  In introductory [[calculus]], when the word ''function'' is used without qualification, it means a real-valued function of a single real variable.  The more general definition of a function is usually introduced to second or third year college students with STEM majors, and in their senior year they are introduced to calculus in a larger, more rigorous setting in courses such as [[real analysis]] and [[complex analysis]].

===Real function===
{{see also|Real analysis}}
[[File:Gerade.svg|thumb|right|Graph of a linear function]]
[[File:Polynomialdeg2.svg|thumb|right|Graph of a polynomial function, here a quadratic function.|right]]
[[File:Sine cosine one period.svg|thumb|right|Graph of two trigonometric functions: [[sine]] and [[cosine]].]]
A ''real function'' is a [[real-valued function|real-valued]] function of a [[function of a real variable|real variable]], that is, a function whose codomain is the [[real number|field of real numbers]] and whose domain is a set of [[real number]]s that contains an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]. In this section, these functions are simply called ''functions''.

The functions that are most commonly considered in mathematics and its applications have some regularity, that is they are [[continuous function|continuous]], [[differentiable function|differentiable]], and even [[analytic function|analytic]]. This regularity insures that these functions can be visualized by their [[#graph|graphs]]. In this section, all functions are differentiable in some interval.

Functions enjoy [[pointwise operation]]s, that is, if {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are functions, their sum, difference and product are functions defined  by 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(f+g)(x)&amp;=f(x)+g(x)\\
(f-g)(x)&amp;=f(x)-g(x)\\
(f\cdot g)(x)&amp;=f(x)\cdot g(x)\\
\end{align}.&lt;/math&gt;
The domains of the resulting functions are the [[set intersection|intersection]] of the domains of {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}}. The quotient of two functions is defined similarly by 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac fg(x)=\frac{f(x)}{g(x)},&lt;/math&gt;
but the domain of the resulting function is obtained by removing the [[zero of a function|zeros]] of {{mvar|g}} from the intersection of the domains of {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}}.

The [[polynomial function]]s are defined by [[polynomial]]s, and their domain is the whole set of real numbers. They include [[constant function]]s, [[linear function]]s and [[quadratic function]]s. [[Rational function]]s are quotients of two polynomial functions, and their domain is the real numbers with a finite number of them removed to avoid [[division by zero]].  The simplest rational function is the function &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto \frac 1x,&lt;/math&gt; whose graph is an [[hyperbola]], and whose domain is the whole [[real line]] except for 0.

The [[derivative]] of a real differentiable function is a real function. An [[antiderivative]] of a continuous real function is a real function that is differentiable in any [[open interval]] in which the original function is continuous. For example, the function &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto\frac 1x&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, and even differentiable, on the positive real numbers. Thus one antiderivative, which takes the value zero for {{math|1=''x'' = 1}}, is a differentiable function called the [[natural logarithm]].

A real function {{mvar|f}} is [[monotonic function|monotonic]] in an interval if the sign of &lt;math&gt;\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{x-y}&lt;/math&gt; does not depend of the choice of {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} in the interval. If the function is differentiable in the interval, it is monotonic if the sign of the derivative is constant in the interval. If a real function {{mvar|f}} is monotonic in an interval {{mvar|I}}, it has an [[inverse function]], which is a real function with domain {{math|''f''(''I'')}} and image {{mvar|I}}. This is how [[inverse trigonometric functions]] are defined in terms of [[trigonometric functions]], where the trigonometric functions are monotonic. Another example: the natural logarithm is monotonic on the positive real numbers, and its image is the whole real line; therefore it has an inverse function that is a [[bijection]] between the real numbers and the positive real numbers. This inverse is the [[exponential function]].

Many other real functions are defined either by the [[implicit function theorem]] (the inverse function is a particular instance) or as solutions of [[differential equation]]s. For example the [[sine]] and the [[cosine]] functions are the solutions of the [[linear differential equation]] 
:&lt;math&gt;y''+y=0&lt;/math&gt;
such that 
:&lt;math&gt;\sin 0=0, \quad \cos 0=1, \quad\frac{\partial \sin x}{\partial x}(0)=1, \quad\frac{\partial \cos x}{\partial x}(0)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Complex function===
{{main|complex analysis}}
{{expand section|date=April 2018}}

When working with complex numbers different types of functions are used&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=L. Ahlfors|title=Complex Analysis|year=1966|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=21|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt;: 

* Complex-valued functions, functions that return complex values 
::&lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;
:for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; an arbitrary set, or perhaps a subset of the real numbers. 
* Or a function for which both domain and range are subsets of the complex numbers.
::&lt;math&gt;f\colon \mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Complex variable functions that return, say real numbers or other values
::&lt;math&gt;f\colon \mathbb{C}\to X&lt;/math&gt;.
The study of complex functions is a vast subject in mathematics with many applications, and that can claim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. B. Conway|title=Functions of one complex variable|year=1978|publisher=Springer-Verlag|page=vii|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be an ancestor to many other areas of mathematics, like [[homotopy theory]], and [[manifolds]].

==Function space==
{{Main|Function space|Functional analysis}}
In [[mathematical analysis]], and more specifically in [[functional analysis]], a '''function space''' is a set of [[scalar-valued function|scalar-valued]] or [[vector-valued function]]s, which share a specific property and form a [[topological vector space]]. For example, the real [[smooth function]]s with a [[compact support]] (that is, they are zero outside some [[compact set]]) form a function space that is at the basis of the theory of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]].

Function spaces play a fundamental role in advanced mathematical analysis, by allowing the use of their algebraic and [[topology|topological]] properties for studying properties of functions. For example, all theorems of existence and uniqueness of solutions of [[ordinary differential equation|ordinary]] or [[partial differential equation]]s result of the study of function spaces.

==Generalizations==
===Natural extension===
It is rather frequent that a function with domain {{mvar|X}} may be naturally extended to a function whose domain is a set {{mvar|Z}} that is built from {{mvar|X}}.

For example, for any set {{mvar|X}}, its [[power set]] {{math|{{mathcal|P}}(''X'')}} is the set of all subsets of {{mvar|X}}. Any function &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to Y,&lt;/math&gt; may be extended to a function on power sets by 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;\mathcal P(X) \to \mathcal P(Y) \\
&amp;S \mapsto f(S)
\end {align}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''f''{{space|hair}}(''S'')}} is the image by {{mvar|f}} of the subset {{mvar|S}} of {{mvar|X}}.

According to the definition, a function {{mvar|f}} maps each element from its domain {{mvar|X}} to some element of its codomain {{mvar|Y}}. It is often convenient to extend this meaning to apply to arbitrary subsets of the domain, which are, as immediately can be checked, mapped to subsets of the codomain, thus considering a function &lt;math&gt;\tilde f,&lt;/math&gt; mapping its domain, the powerset  {{mathcal|P}}({{mvar|X}}) of {{mvar|f}} 's domain {{mvar|X}}, to its codomain, a subset of the powerset {{mathcal|P}}({{mvar|Y}}) of {{mvar|f}} 's codomain {{mvar|Y}}.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal P(X) \to \mathcal P(Y) \\
S \mapsto f(S).
\end {align}&lt;/math&gt;
Under slight [[abuse of notation]] this function on subsets is often denoted also by {{mvar|f}}.

Another example is the following. If the function
&lt;math&gt;f\colon R\to S&lt;/math&gt;
is a [[ring homomorphism]], it may be extended to a function on [[polynomial ring]]s
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
R[x]&amp;\to S[x]\\
\sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i&amp;\mapsto \sum _{i=0}^n f(a_i)x^i,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
which is also a ring homomorphism.

===Multi-valued functions===
{{main|Multi-valued function}}
[[File:Function with two values 1.svg|thumb|right|Together, the two square roots of all nonnegative real numbers form a single smooth curve.]]
[[File:Xto3minus3x.svg|thumb|right]]
Several methods for specifying functions of real or complex variables start from a local definition of the funcion at a point or on a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of a point, and then extend by continuity the function to a much larger domain. Frequently, for a starting point &lt;math&gt;x_0,&lt;/math&gt; there are several possible starting values for the function. 

For example, in defining the [[square root]] as the inverse function of the square function, for any positive real number &lt;math&gt;x_0,&lt;/math&gt; there are two choices for the value of the square root, one of which is positive and denoted &lt;math&gt;\sqrt {x_0},&lt;/math&gt; and another which is negative and denoted &lt;math&gt;-\sqrt {x_0}.&lt;/math&gt; These choices define two continuous functions, both having the nonnegative real numbers as a domain, and having either the nonnegative or the nonpositive real numbers as images. When looking at the graphs of these functions, one can see that, together, they form a single [[smooth curve]]. It is therefore often useful to consider these two square root functions as a single function that has two values for positive {{mvar|x}}, one value for 0 and no value for negative {{mvar|x}}.

In the preceding example, one choice, the positive square root, is more natural than the other. This is not the case in general. For example, let consider the [[implicit function]] that maps {{mvar|y}} to a [[root of a function|root]] {{mvar|x}} of &lt;math&gt;x^3-3x-y =0&lt;/math&gt; (see the figure on the right). For {{math|1=''y'' = 0}} one may choose either &lt;math&gt;0, \sqrt 3,\text{ or } -\sqrt 3&lt;/math&gt; for {{mvar|x.}} By the [[implicit function theorem]], each choice defines a function; for the first one, the (maximal) domain is the interval {{math|[–2, 2]}} and the image is {{math|[–1, 1]}}; for the second one, the domain is {{math|[–2, ∞)}} and the image is {{math|[1, ∞)}}; for the last one, the domain is {{math|(–∞, 2]}} and the image is {{math|(–∞, –1]}}. As the three graphs together form a smooth curve, and there is no reason for preferring one choice, these three functions are often considered as a single ''multi-valued function'' of {{mvar|y}} that has three values for {{math|–2 &lt; ''y'' &lt; 2}}, and only one value for {{math|''y'' ≤ –2}} and {{math|''y'' ≥ –2}}.

Usefulness of the concept of multi-valued functions is clearer when considering complex functions, typically [[analytic function]]s. The domain to which a complex function may be extended by [[analytic continuation]] generally consists of almost the whole [[complex plane]]. However, when extending the domain through two different paths, one often gets different values. For example, when extending the domain of the square root function, along a path of complex numbers with positive imaginary parts, one gets {{mvar|i}} for the square root of –1; while, when extending through complex numbers with negative imaginary parts, one gets {{math|–''i''}}. There are generally two ways of solving the problem. One may define a function that is not [[continuous function|continuous]] along some curve, called a [[branch cut]]. Such a function is called the [[principal value]] of the function. The other way is to consider that one has a ''multi-valued function'', which is analytic everywhere except for isolated singularities, but whose value may "jump" if one follows a closed loop around a singularity. This jump is called the [[monodromy]].

==In [[foundations of mathematics]] and [[set theory]]==

The definition of a function that is given in this article requires the concept of [[set (mathematics)|set]], since the domain and the codomain of a function must be a set. This is not a problem in usual mathematics, as it is generally not difficult to consider only functions whose domain and codomain are sets, which are well defined, even if the domain is not explicitly defined. However, it is sometimes useful to consider more general functions. 

For example the [[singleton set]] may be considered as a function &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto \{x\}.&lt;/math&gt; Its domain would include all sets, and therefore would not be a set. In usual mathematics, one avoids this kind of problem by specifying a domain, which means that one has many singleton functions. However, when establishing foundations of mathematics, one may have to use functions whose domain, codomain or both are not specified, and some authors, often logicians, give precise definition for these weakly specified functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Gödel |1940 |p=16}}; {{harvnb |Jech |2003 |p=11}}; {{harvnb |Cunningham |2016 |p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These generalized functions may be critical in the development of a formalization of foundations of mathematics. For example, the [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], is an extension of the set theory in which the collection of all sets is a [[Class (set theory)|class]]. This theory includes the [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory#NBG's axiom of replacement|replacement axiom]], which may be interpreted as "if {{mvar|X}} is a set, and {{mvar|F}} is a function, then {{math|''F''[''X'']}} is a set".

Without active driving of the outermost ring, all four axes can become aligned in a plane as shown above, again leading to gimbal lock and inability to roll.]]

'''Gimbal lock''' is the loss of one [[degree of freedom (mechanics)|degree of freedom]] in a three-dimensional, three-[[gimbal]] mechanism that occurs when the axes of two of the three gimbals are driven into a parallel configuration, "locking" the system into [[rotation]] in a degenerate two-dimensional space.

The word ''lock'' is misleading: no gimbal is restrained. All three gimbals can still rotate freely about their respective axes of suspension. Nevertheless, because of the parallel orientation of two of the gimbals' axes there is no gimbal available to accommodate rotation about one axis.

==Gimbals==
{{Main|Gimbal}}

A gimbal is a ring that is suspended so it can rotate about an axis. Gimbals are typically nested one within another to accommodate rotation about multiple axes.

They appear in [[gyroscope]]s and in [[inertial measurement unit]]s to allow the inner gimbal's orientation to remain fixed while the outer gimbal suspension assumes any orientation. In [[compasses]] and [[flywheel energy storage]] mechanisms they allow objects to remain upright. They are used to orient [[Rocket engine|thrusters]] on rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/gimbal.htm|title=What is a gimbal -- and what does it have to do with NASA?|author=Jonathan Strickland|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[coordinate system]]s in mathematics behave as if there were real gimbals used to measure the angles, notably [[Euler angles]].

For cases of three or fewer nested gimbals, gimbal lock inevitably occurs at some point in the system due to properties of [[covering space]]s (described below).

==In engineering==
While only two specific orientations produce exact gimbal lock, practical mechanical gimbals encounter difficulties near those orientations.  When a set of gimbals is close to the locked configuration, small rotations of the gimbal platform require large motions of the surrounding gimbals.  Although the ratio is infinite only at the point of gimbal lock, the practical speed and acceleration limits of the gimbals&amp;mdash;due to inertia (resulting from the mass of each gimbal ring), bearing friction, the flow resistance of air or other fluid surrounding the gimbals (if they are not in a vacuum), and other physical and engineering factors&amp;mdash;limit the motion of the platform close to that point.

===In two dimensions===
Gimbal lock can occur in gimbal systems with two degrees of freedom such as a [[theodolite]] with rotations about an [[azimuth]] and elevation in two dimensions. These systems can gimbal lock at [[zenith]] and [[nadir]], because at those points azimuth is not well-defined, and rotation in the azimuth direction does not change the direction the theodolite is pointing.

Consider tracking a helicopter flying towards the theodolite from the horizon. The theodolite is a telescope mounted on a tripod so that it can move in azimuth and elevation to track the helicopter. The helicopter flies towards the theodolite and is tracked by the telescope in elevation and azimuth. The helicopter flies immediately above the tripod (i.e. it is at zenith) when it changes direction and flies at 90 degrees to its previous course. The telescope cannot track this maneuver without a discontinuous jump in one or both of the gimbal orientations. There is no continuous motion that allows it to follow the target. It is in gimbal lock. So there is an infinity of directions around zenith for which the telescope cannot continuously track all movements of a target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/aug98/896993617.Eg.r.html |title= Re: What is meant by the term gimbal lock? |author= Adrian Popa |date= June 4, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that even if the helicopter does not pass through zenith, but only ''near'' zenith, so that gimbal lock does not occur, the system must still move exceptionally rapidly to track it, as it rapidly passes from one bearing to the other. The closer to zenith the nearest point is, the faster this must be done, and if it actually goes through zenith, the limit of these "increasingly rapid" movements becomes ''infinitely'' fast, namely discontinuous.

To recover from gimbal lock the user has to go around the zenith – explicitly: reduce the elevation, change the azimuth to match the azimuth of the target, then change the elevation to match the target.

Mathematically, this corresponds to the fact that [[spherical coordinates]] do not define a [[coordinate chart]] on the sphere at zenith and nadir. Alternatively, the corresponding map ''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;rarr;''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; from the [[torus]] ''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to the sphere ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (given by the point with given azimuth and elevation) is not a [[covering map]] at these points.

===In three dimensions===
[[File:Gimbal lock airplane.gif|thumb|Gimbal locked airplane. When the pitch (green) and yaw (magenta) gimbals become aligned, changes to roll (blue) and yaw apply the same rotation to the airplane.]]
[[Image:no gimbal lock.png|thumb|Normal situation: the three gimbals are independent]]
[[Image:gimbal lock.png|thumb|Gimbal lock: two out of the three gimbals are in the same plane, one degree of freedom is lost]]

Consider a case of a level-sensing platform on an aircraft flying due north with its three gimbal axes mutually perpendicular (i.e., [[Roll (flight)|roll]], [[Pitch (aviation)|pitch]] and [[Yaw angle|yaw]] angles each zero). If the aircraft pitches up 90 degrees, the aircraft and platform's yaw axis gimbal becomes parallel to the roll axis gimbal, and changes about yaw can no longer be compensated for.

===Solutions===
This problem may be overcome by use of a fourth gimbal, intelligently driven by a motor so as to maintain a large angle between roll and yaw gimbal axes.  Another solution is to rotate one or more of the gimbals to an arbitrary position when gimbal lock is detected and thus reset the device.

Modern practice is to avoid the use of gimbals entirely. In the context of [[inertial navigation system]]s, that can be done by mounting the inertial sensors directly to the body of the vehicle (this is called a [[strapdown]] system)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xenia.media.mit.edu/~verp/projects/smartpen/node8.html#SECTION00322000000000000000|title=Overview of Pen Design and Navigation Background|author=Chris Verplaetse|year=1995|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214023126/http://xenia.media.mit.edu/~verp/projects/smartpen/node8.html#SECTION00322000000000000000|archivedate=2009-02-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and integrating sensed rotation and acceleration digitally using [[quaternion]] methods to derive vehicle orientation and velocity. Another way to replace gimbals is to use fluid bearings or a flotation chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?IA=US2005043537&amp;DISPLAY=DESC|title=Articulated gas bearing support pads|author=Chappell, Charles, D.|year=2006}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On Apollo 11===
A well-known gimbal lock incident happened in the [[Apollo 11]] Moon mission. On this spacecraft, a set of gimbals was used on an [[inertial measurement unit]] (IMU). The engineers were aware of the gimbal lock problem but had declined to use a fourth gimbal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/e-1344.htm|title=Apollo Guidance and Navigation - Considerations of Apollo IMU Gimbal Lock - MIT Instrumentation Laboratory Document E-1344|author=David Hoag|year=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reasoning behind this decision is apparent from the following quote:

{{Quote|"The advantages of the redundant gimbal seem to be outweighed by the equipment simplicity, size advantages, and corresponding implied reliability of the direct three degree of freedom unit."|David Hoag|''Apollo Lunar Surface Journal''}}

They preferred an alternate solution using an indicator that would be triggered when near to 85 degrees pitch.

{{Quote|"Near that point, in a closed stabilization loop, the torque motors could theoretically be commanded to flip the gimbal 180 degrees instantaneously. Instead, in the [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM]], the computer flashed a 'gimbal lock' warning at 70 degrees and froze the IMU at 85 degrees"|Paul Fjeld|''Apollo Lunar Surface Journal''}}

Rather than try to drive the gimbals faster than they could go, the system simply gave up and froze the platform. From this point, the spacecraft would have to be manually moved away from the gimbal lock position, and the platform would have to be manually realigned using the stars as a reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/gimbals.html|title=Gimbal Angles, Gimbal Lock, and a Fourth Gimbal for Christmas|author1=Eric M. Jones |author2=Paul Fjeld |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Lunar Module had landed, [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Mike Collins]] aboard the Command Module joked "How about sending me a fourth gimbal for Christmas?"

===Robotics===
[[File:Automation of foundry with robot.jpg|thumb|right|Industrial robot operating in a foundry.]]
In robotics, gimbal lock is commonly referred to as "wrist flip", due to the use of a "triple-roll wrist" in [[robotic arm]]s, where three axes of the wrist, controlling yaw, pitch, and roll, all pass through a common point.

An example of a wrist flip, also called a wrist singularity, is when the path through which the robot is traveling causes the first and third axes of the robot's wrist to line up. The second wrist axis then attempts to spin 180° in zero time to maintain the orientation of the end effector. The result of a singularity can be quite dramatic and can have adverse effects on the robot arm, the end effector, and the process.

The importance of avoiding singularities in robotics has led the American National Standard for Industrial Robots and Robot Systems — Safety Requirements to define it as "a condition caused by the collinear alignment of two or more robot axes resulting in unpredictable robot motion and velocities".&lt;ref&gt;ANSI/RIA R15.06-1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==In applied mathematics==
{{No footnotes|section|date=July 2013}}
The problem of gimbal lock appears when one uses [[Euler angles]] in applied mathematics; developers of 3D [[computer program]]s, such as [[3D modeling]], [[inertial guidance system|embedded navigation systems]], and [[video game]]s must take care to avoid it.

In formal language, gimbal lock occurs because the map from Euler angles to rotations (topologically, from the 3-torus ''T&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' to the [[real projective space]] '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; which is the same as the space of 3d rotations SO3) is not a [[covering map]] – it is not a [[local homeomorphism]] at every point, and thus at some points the [[Rank (differential topology)|rank]] (degrees of freedom) must drop below 3, at which point gimbal lock occurs. Euler angles provide a means for giving a numerical description of any [[rotation]] in three-dimensional space using three numbers, but not only is this description not unique, but there are some points where not every change in the target space (rotations) can be realized by a change in the source space (Euler angles). This is a topological constraint – there is no covering map from the 3-torus to the 3-dimensional real projective space; the only (non-trivial) covering map is from the 3-sphere, as in the use of [[quaternions]].

To make a comparison, all the [[translation (geometry)|translations]] can be described using three numbers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, as the succession of three consecutive linear movements along three perpendicular axes &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; axes. The same holds true for rotations: all the rotations can be described using three numbers &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, as the succession of three rotational movements around three axes that are perpendicular one to the next. This similarity between linear coordinates and angular coordinates makes Euler angles very [[intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]], but unfortunately they suffer from the gimbal lock problem.

===Loss of a degree of freedom with Euler angles===
A rotation in 3D space can be represented numerically with [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] in several ways. One of these representations is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
R &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \cos \alpha &amp; -\sin \alpha \\
0 &amp; \sin \alpha &amp; \cos \alpha \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \beta &amp; 0 &amp; \sin \beta \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
-\sin \beta &amp; 0 &amp; \cos \beta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \gamma &amp; -\sin \gamma &amp; 0 \\
\sin \gamma &amp; \cos \gamma &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

An example worth examining happens when &lt;math&gt;\beta = \tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Knowing that &lt;math&gt;\cos \tfrac{\pi}{2} = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin \tfrac{\pi}{2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, the above expression becomes equal to:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 R &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \cos \alpha &amp; -\sin \alpha \\
0 &amp; \sin \alpha &amp; \cos \alpha \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
-1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \gamma &amp; -\sin \gamma &amp; 0 \\
\sin \gamma &amp; \cos \gamma &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Carrying out [[matrix multiplication]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 R &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\sin \alpha &amp; \cos \alpha &amp; 0 \\
-\cos \alpha &amp; \sin \alpha &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \gamma &amp; -\sin \gamma &amp; 0 \\
\sin \gamma &amp; \cos \gamma &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\sin \alpha \cos \gamma + \cos \alpha \sin \gamma &amp; -\sin \alpha \sin \gamma + \cos \alpha \cos \gamma &amp; 0 \\
-\cos \alpha \cos \gamma + \sin \alpha \sin \gamma &amp; \cos \alpha \sin \gamma + \sin \alpha \cos \gamma &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

And finally using the [[trigonometry formulas#Angle sum and difference identities|trigonometry formulas]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 R &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\sin ( \alpha + \gamma ) &amp; \cos (\alpha + \gamma) &amp; 0 \\
-\cos ( \alpha + \gamma ) &amp; \sin (\alpha + \gamma) &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Changing the values of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; in the above matrix has the same effects: the rotation angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha + \gamma&lt;/math&gt; changes, but the rotation axis remains in the &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; direction: the last column and the first row in the matrix won't change. The only solution for &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; to recover different roles is to change &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

It is possible to imagine an airplane rotated by the above-mentioned Euler angles using the '''X-Y-Z''' convention. In this case, the first angle - &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the pitch. Yaw is then set to &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and the final rotation - by &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; - is again the airplane's pitch. Because of gimbal lock, it has lost one of the degrees of freedom - in this case the ability to roll.

It is also possible to choose another convention for representing a rotation with a matrix using Euler angles than the '''X-Y-Z''' convention above, and also choose other variation intervals for the angles, but in the end there is always at least one value for which a degree of freedom is lost.

The gimbal lock problem does not make Euler angles "invalid" (they always serve as a well-defined coordinate system), but it makes them unsuited for some practical applications.

===Alternate orientation representation===
The cause of gimbal lock is representing an orientation as three axial rotations with [[Euler angles]]. A potential solution therefore is to represent the orientation in some other way. This could be as a [[rotation matrix]], a quaternion (see [[quaternions and spatial rotation]]), or a similar orientation representation that treats the orientation as a value rather than three separate and related values. Given such a representation, the user stores the orientation as a value. To apply angular changes, the orientation is modified by a delta angle/axis rotation. The resulting orientation must be re-normalized to prevent [[Floating point#Accuracy problems|floating-point error]] from successive transformations from accumulating. For matrices, re-normalizing the result requires converting the matrix into its [[orthonormal matrix#Nearest orthogonal matrix|nearest orthonormal representation]]. For quaternions, re-normalization requires [[unit quaternions|performing quaternion normalization]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36395">'''Implicit attitudes''' are evaluations that occur without [[Consciousness|conscious]] awareness towards an attitude object or the self. These evaluations are generally either favorable or unfavorable. They come about from various influences in the individual experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The commonly used definition of implicit [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]] within [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]] and [[social psychology]] comes from [[Anthony Greenwald]] and [[Mahzarin Banaji]]'s template for definitions of terms related to [[implicit cognition]] (see also [[implicit stereotype]] and [[implicit self-esteem]] for usage of this template): "Implicit attitudes are introspectively unidentified (or inaccurately identified) traces of past experience that mediate favorable or unfavorable feeling, thought, or action toward social objects".&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenwald | first1 = A.G. | last2 = Banaji | first2 = M.R. | year = 1995 | title = Implicit social cognition: Attitudes, self-esteem, and stereotypes | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 102 | issue = 1| pages = 4–27 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.102.1.4 | pmid=7878162}}&lt;/ref&gt; These thoughts, feelings or actions have an influence on behavior that the individual may not be aware of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gawronski|first1=B|last2=Payne|first2=B.K.|title=Handbook of Implicit Social Cognition: Measurement, Theory and Application|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An attitude is differentiated from the concept of a [[stereotype]] in that it functions as a broad favorable or unfavorable characteristic towards a social object, whereas a stereotype is a set of favorable and/or unfavorable characteristics which are applied to an individual based on [[social group]] membership.

== Causes and manifestations ==
A number of different theories have been proposed relating to the formation, development, and influence of implicit attitudes.

=== Halo effect ===
{{Main article|Halo effect}}
Based on many empirical findings, Greenwald and Banaji et al. (1995) generated the fundamental idea of implicit attitude definitively for the first time, disambiguating attitude into explicit and implicit types. Halo effects are an example of the empirical research used by Greenwald and Banaji in their chapter on implicit social cognition. Understanding halo effects set the foundation for understanding other theories regarding implicit attitudes. For example, it is possible to explain implicit partisanship or [[implicit egotism]] in terms of a halo effect, however these concepts will discussed more in subsequent sections.

Pioneered by [[Edward Thorndike]] in 1920, the halo effect is the judgement of attribute "A" being influenced by a known but irrelevant attribute "B". For example, subsequent replications commonly use physical attractiveness as attribute "B" and attribute "A" being a judgement of the subject. More specifically a study Landy and Sigall et al. (1974) found that essays written by female essayists were found to be of higher quality when a photo showed the essayist as being attractive (rather than unattractive) when rated by male judges.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

Greenwald and Banaji et al. (1995) have suggested that attribute "B" is in fact an implicit attitude when the judge or subject cannot identify attribute "B" as the source of the judgement for attribute "A". Moreover, when attribute "B" is associated with a positive or negative attitude and additionally is unknowingly and automatically transferred onto attribute "A", that attitude of attribute "B" is known to be an implicit attitude.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

=== Experiences and socialization ===
Earlier research findings on implicit attitudes show that [[socialization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Stereotype and Prejudice: Their automatic and controlled components|last = Devine|first = P. G|date = 1989|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|accessdate = |doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.56.1.5 |pmid = |volume=56 |pages=5–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reflections of past experiences&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt;  may be responsible for the development or manifestation of longer lasting implicit attitudes. As an example, [[Laurie A. Rudman|Rudman]] and Goodwin et al. (2004) found that individuals who were primarily raised by their mothers showed a more positive implicit attitude towards women rather than men. Furthermore, Olson and [[Russell H. Fazio|Fazio]] et al. (2001, 2002) suggest that these implicit attitudes are a result of repeated pairings of positive or negative stimuli with an object; more pairings of positive stimuli would result in a more positive implicit attitude and vice versa. This finding supports the fundamental principals of [[classical conditioning]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Implicit attitudes 101: Theoretical and empirical Insights|last = Devos|first = T.|publisher = Psychology Press|year = 2008|isbn = |location = New York, NY|pages = Attitudes and attitude change (pp. 61–84)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Implicit attitudes are also developed by more recent experiences as well. For example, Rudmore, Ashmore, &amp; Gary et al. (2001) found that implicit attitude of [[prejudice]] against African Americans could be shaped through diversity training intervention using variables at an emotional level rather than increased awareness of bias which helped explicit attitude more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Implicit attitudes related to the self ===
Self-related objects are anything that pertains to the self; including in-groups and self-esteem (attitude towards the self).

Early research by Nuttin et al. (1985) suggested that people generally have an implicit preference for letters in their own name, known as the [[Name letter effect]]. Further replications of this same effect with varying independent variables (e.g., attractiveness to people with the same letters contained in their names) suggest that people have an implicit preference towards themselves. This manifestation of implicit attitude has come to be known as [[Implicit egotism]]. Implicit egotism additionally manifests itself in in-groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Implicit partisanship ''is the heightened attractiveness and identification to a self-related group and negative or neutral attitudes towards non-self-related groups. Greenwald, Pickrell, and Farnham et al. (2002) demonstrated this effect even when the groups were cooperative and when the members of the groups were non-human. Much of the research on implicit partisanship suggests that this is an uncontrollable process, or an implicit attitude towards self-related groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Culture and social norms ===
Generally speaking, [[culture]] and social [[Norms (sociology)|norms]] have an effect on implicit attitude in the same way experiences and socialization have an effect on implicit attitude. However, culture has a very noticeable effect on implicit attitude in the way implicit attitude differs from one's explicit attitude. Livingston et al. (2002) examined the effect of mainstream culture on one's implicit attitude towards their social group. Implicitly, one will follow the cultural attitudes towards their social group that they perceive from mainstream culture in their society whether that be positive or negative. With that said, a strong cultural disadvantage (e.g., negative attitude) can effectively eliminate in-group favoritism when tested at the implicit level. However it may be important to note that at the explicit attitude level, these individuals still showed positive attitudes towards their social group. Olson and Fazio et al. (2004) have suggested that at an implicit level one's personal attitude can be influenced by the social or cultural norms that one perceives. Furthermore, this may be due to a weak distinction between one's personal attitude and extrapersonal associations (e.g., one's cultural evaluations) towards an attitude object at the implicit level. From this we can conclude that implicit attitudes are indeed reflective of experiences but can also be shaped by the cultural context.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Degree of awareness ==
Current research supports the idea that there are three different aspects of attitudes captured by current indirect measures that could be outside of conscious awareness: the source, the content, and the impact of an attitude.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gawronski | first1 = B. | last2 = Hofmann | first2 = W. | last3 = Wilbur | first3 = C. | year = 2006 | title = Are "implicit" attitudes unconscious? | url = | journal = Consciousness &amp; Cognition | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 485–499 | doi=10.1016/j.concog.2005.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Source awareness is described as the “awareness of the origin of a particular attitude” (emphasis added).&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt; Content awareness is differentiated from source awareness by the lack of awareness about the attitude, rather than simply its origin. Finally, one may have awareness of both the attitude and its source but the attitude may still have influences on thought or behavior beyond ones awareness; this can be thought of as impact awareness.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;  Conclusions have been made that both indirectly assessed and self-reported attitudes can be characterized by lack of source awareness, there is no evidence for lack of content awareness of indirectly assessed attitudes, and there is some evidence showing that indirectly assessed, but not self-reported, attitudes can be characterized by lack of impact awareness.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt; The most compelling evidence for content awareness of implicit attitudes has showed that people are highly accurate in predicting their scores on the [[Implicit Association Test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hahn | first1 = A. | last2 = Judd | first2 = C.M. | last3 = Hirsh | first3 = H.K. | last4 = Blair | first4 =  | year = 2013 | title = Awareness of implicit attitudes | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: General | volume =  143| issue = | pages =  1369–1392| doi = 10.1037/a0035028 | pmc = 4038711}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flexibility ==
Recent research indicates the possibility of the [[malleability]] of implicit attitudes based on situational context.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That is, implicit attitudes are not believed to be stable representations of memory, rather they are constructed based on the type of available information in a given situation. Available information can vary in context to the individual, though it is believed to serve as a prime to their behaviors. Flexibility of implicit attitudes is best demonstrated through measures that include accessibility effects. For example, it has been demonstrated that the information given to an individual prior to completing an implicit measure directly effects their response based on the information they were given.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, if an individual is primed with information regarding the positive, or negative, attributions of a different race and then asked to complete an implicit measures task, the participants will most likely use the information that was presented during the prime and not their own experienced information to assess the situation. This occurs because the information that was primed is most available for the participant to access without having to use conscious resources.

== Effects on behavior ==
The fundamental goal of measuring implicit attitudes is to use it to predict [[behavior]]; behaviors that can't be predicted by knowledge of explicitly held attitudes. Numerous studies, such as research conducted by Chen and Bargh (1999) show that automatic evaluations triggered by various attitudes towards objects directly affected [[behavioral predispositions]] towards that object. [[Stimulation|Stimuli]] that elicited positive attitudes produced immediate positive behavior whilst stimuli that elicited negative attitudes triggered immediate avoidance behavior. The individuals are completely unaware of the operations that their behavioral responses because they are automatic and unconscious. In Bassenoff and Sherman et al. (2000) they found that automatic negative attitudes about overweight individuals directly predicted how far participants choose to sit from a fat woman, who they were expected to interact with. We see this phenomenon also with implicitly held racial attitudes as shown by McConnell and Leibold et al. (2001). These implicit attitudes affected how long they interacted for, how much participants smiled, how many speech errors they made and how many social comments were made. All automatic behavioral responses that measuring explicit attitudes could not predict.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Types of behavior affected by implicit attitudes ===
Implicit attitudes aren't always better at predicting behavior than explicit measurements, they both play a systematic role in predicting behavior. Implicit attitudes are typically better than explicit attitudes at predicting behavior that is automatic and spontaneous. In line with [[Dual process theory|Dual process theories]] such as [[Russell H. Fazio|Fazio]]'s [[MODE model]], automatic attitudes determine spontaneous actions, whereas deliberative actions reflect a contribution of multiple processes, including more controlled processes (e.g., a person's motivation to overcome prejudiced responses).&lt;ref&gt;Fazio, R. H., &amp; Towles-Schwen, T. (1999). The MODE model of attitude-behavior processes. In S. Chaiken Y. Trope (Eds.), ''Dual process theories in social psychology'' (pp. 97-116). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; As demonstrated by Dasgupta an Rivera et al. (2006), individuals who endorsed traditional beliefs about gender and sexuality were friendlier towards gay confederates verbally but showed negative [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal behavior]], this suggested that this individuals were consciously over-correcting their behavior but their [[prejudice]] leaked out through automatic responses like blinking and eye contact.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Effects of motivation ===
Although, research has shown that motivation and an opportunity to react carefully can affect how much implicit attitudes influence behavioral response, Fazio (2001). When individuals are highly motivated to control their responses and processing abilities are not lacking or preoccupied, behavioral responses tend to reflect intentional processes. In Towles-schwen and Fazio (2003) they measured anticipated willingness and discomfort of participants to interact with a black person. Individuals who were motivated to avoid interracial conflicts and where not concerned about seeming biased expressed their discomfort; whereas individuals who were concerned about not appearing biased reported less anticipated discomfort, in an attempt to hide their prejudice. Motivation to control our responses can minimize the influence of implicit attitudes on behavioral responses as shown by that example.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Measurement ==
There is an assortment of different experimental tests that assess for the presence of implicit attitudes, including the implicit association test, evaluative and semantic priming tasks, the Extrinsic Affective Simon Task, Go/No-Go Association Task, and the Affect Misattribution Procedure. Though these tests vary in administration, and content, the basis of each is to "allow investigators to capture attitudes that individuals are unwilling to report."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Implicit Attitudes 101: Theoretical and empirical insight|last = Devos|first = T.|publisher = Psychology Press|year = 2008|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unwillingness and lack of ability are intertwined considering most individuals are unaware that these attitudes even exist. The following are brief descriptions about these measurements, which are most commonly used to assess implicit attitudes, and the empirical evidence that supports them.

=== Implicit Association Test ===

The [[Implicit-association test|Implicit Association Test]] is a [[:wikt:latency|latency]]-based measure of the relative associations between two concepts.  In a series of tasks, participants sort words or images representing a target concept such as race (white/black) and stimuli with known positive/negative [[valence (psychology)|valence]] into two categories (usually indicated by right or left location on a computer screen).  Each category of concept words or images is paired with both positive and negative stimuli. The faster the categorization occurs, the stronger the association is between words and/or images that are grouped together (ex. faster categorization of dogs when paired with positive rather than negative words), which would indicate and implicit attitude towards that object.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenwald | first1 = A.G. | last2 = McGhee | first2 = D.E. | last3 = Schwartz | first3 = M. | year = 1998 | title = Measuring individual differences in implicit cognition: The Implicit Association Test | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 1464–1480 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.6.1464 | pmid=9654756}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full demonstration of the IAT procedure can be found at the [[Project Implicit]] link and the IAT Inquisit link below.

Research using the IAT measure of implicit attitudes has demonstrated consistent experimental and population-based attitudes with respect to concepts such as gender, race, and age.  A recent analysis from the [[Project Implicit]] database found that science-gender stereotypes are predictive of differences in gender related math and science performance across countries in an international sample.&lt;ref name="ref4"&gt;Nosek, B.A., Smyth, F.L., Sriram, N., Lindner, N.M., Devos, T., Ayala, A., et al. (2009).  National differences in gender-science stereotypes predict national sex differences in science and math achievement.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also successfully used the IAT in consumer research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = B.A.S. | last2 = Lee | first2 = M.S.W. | last3 = Lacey | first3 = C. | year = 2011 | title = Countering negative country of origin effects using imagery processing | url = http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Martin-et-al.-2011.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Consumer Behaviour | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 80–92 | doi=10.1002/cb.351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evaluative priming task ===

Research using the evaluative priming task has been frequently used in research on eating and attitudes towards food.&lt;ref name="ref7"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roefs | first1 = A. | last2 = Herman | first2 = C.P. | last3 = MacLeod | first3 = C.M. | last4 = Smulders | first4 = F.T. | last5 = Jansen | first5 = A. | year = 2005 | title = At first sight: How do restrained eaters evaluate high-fat palatable foods? | url = | journal = Appetite | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 103–114 | doi=10.1016/j.appet.2004.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In clinical studies, the procedure was used to study attitudes of those diagnosed with eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa.&lt;ref name="ref8"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roefs | first1 = A. | last2 = Stapert | first2 = D. | last3 = Isabella | first3 = L.A. | last4 = Wolters | first4 = G. | last5 = Wojciechowski | first5 = F. | last6 = Jansen | first6 = A. | year = 2005 | title = Early associations with food in anorexia nervosa patients and obese people assessed in the affective priming paradigm | url = | journal = Eating Behaviors | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 151–163 | doi=10.1016/j.eatbeh.2004.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with many of the other methods presented here, researchers have used the procedure to measure the effects of stereotypes, including measurement of the effectiveness of stereotype reduction treatments.&lt;ref name="ref9"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gawronski | first1 = B. | last2 = Deutsch | first2 = R. | last3 = Mbirkou | first3 = S. | last4 = Seibt | first4 = B. | last5 = Strack | first5 = F. | year = 2008 | title = When "just say no" is not enough: Affirmation versus negation training and the reduction of automatic stereotype activation | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 2| pages = 370–377 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2006.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Semantic priming task ===

In the semantic priming task paradigm described by Wittenbrink et al. (1997), participants are shown a word prime at intervals which are too brief for reported awareness (see [[subliminal stimuli]]).&lt;ref name="ref10"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wittenbrink | first1 = B. | last2 = Judd | first2 = C.M. | last3 = Park | first3 = B. | year = 1997 | title = Evidence for radical prejudice at the implicit level and its relationship with questionnaire measures | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 262–274 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.2.262}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The word prime consists of two groups of words representing the concept in question (such as black sounding names or white sounding names).  Participants were then asked to complete a [[Lexical decision task|lexical decision task (LDT)]] to identify if target stimuli are words or a non-words.  The target stimuli consist of words with known positive or negative valence.  When words with positive valence are categorized more quickly in the presence of one group of word primes (such as black sounding names), this indicates positive attitudes towards the group.

=== Extrinsic Affective Simon Task (EAST) ===

In the Extrinsic Affective Simon Task (EAST), participants categorized stimuli which consisted of words that either had positive or negative valence that were presented in either the color white or two different colors.&lt;ref name="ref11"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Houwer | first1 = J | year = 2003 | title = The extrinsic affective Simon task | url = | journal = Experimental Psychology | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 77–85 | doi=10.1026/1618-3169.50.2.77}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the words are presented in white, participants categorize based words on their perceived positive or negative valence.  When the words are presented in color, participants are asked to categorize based on color alone and ignore word meaning.  When colored words are presented, categorization accuracy and speed are facilitated when, for words which the respondent has a positive implicit attitude, the response was the same as was expected for white words with obvious positive valence.&lt;ref name="ref11" /&gt; A full demonstration of the EAST procedure can be found in the external links below.

The EAST has been used in research of attitudes of those who have specific phobias and/or anxiety.&lt;ref name="ref12"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellwart | first1 = T. | last2 = Becker | first2 = E.S. | last3 = Rinck | first3 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Activation and measurement of threat associations in fear of spiders: An application of the Extrinsic Affective Simon Task | url = | journal = Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry | volume = 36 | issue = 4| pages = 281–299 | doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2004.08.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref13"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vancleef | first1 = L.M. | last2 = Peters | first2 = M.L. | last3 = Gilissen | first3 = S.M. | last4 = De Jong | first4 = P.J. | year = 2007 | title = Understanding the role of injury/illness sensitivity and anxiety sensitivity in (automatic) pain processing: An examination using the Extrinsic Affective Simon Task | url = | journal = The Journal of Pain | volume = 8 | issue = 7| pages = 563–572 | doi=10.1016/j.jpain.2007.02.431}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the test has been recently used to measure implicit attitudes towards alcohol in populations who have substance abuse problems; and the test has been cited as having relatively high predictive value for problem substance use.&lt;ref name="ref14"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Jong | first1 = P.J. | last2 = Wiers | first2 = W. | last3 = de Braak | first3 = M. | last4 = Huijding | first4 = J. | year = 2007 | title = Using the Extrinsic Affective Simon Test as a measure of implicit attitudes towards alcohol: Relationship with drinking behavior and alcohol problems | url = | journal = Addictive Behaviors | volume = 32 | issue = 4| pages = 881–887 | doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2006.06.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Go/No-go Association Task (GNAT) ===

In practice, the GNAT appears similar to the Implicit Association Test in that participants are asked to categorize targets representing either a concept (such as race; ex. white or black names) or words which have obvious positive or negative valence.  Participants are asked to respond ('go') or decline to respond ('no-go') during a short interval after each of the stimuli are presented.  In test trials, participants are asked to respond to one of the concepts (white or black) and words with either positive or negative valence; these are then switched so that the concept is then paired with the opposite valence category.  When paired with words with positive valence, faster and more accurate responding indicates greater association, and therefore positive attitude towards the target concept (either white or black race).&lt;ref name="ref15"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nosek | first1 = B.A. | last2 = Banaji | first2 = M.R. | year = 2001 | title = The go/no-go association task | url = | journal = Social Cognition | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 625–666 | doi=10.1521/soco.19.6.625.20886}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full demonstration of the GNAT procedure can be found in the external links below.

Like the EAST, the GNAT has been used in populations who have been diagnosed with acute phobias to measure fear associations in addition to research on stereotypes and discrimination.&lt;ref name="ref16"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Teachman | first1 = B.A. | year = 2007 | title = Evaluating implicit spider fear associations using the go/no-go association task | url = | journal = Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 156–167 | doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2006.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP) ===

The Affect Misattribution Procedure relies on participant ratings of neutral stimuli as an indirect measure of implicit attitudes rather than latency or accuracy measures.  In the procedure, participants are first presented with a stimulus (usually an image or word), for either a brief visible period or subliminally, which is suspected to elicit a positive or negative attitude.  Directly afterwards, participants are presented with a neutral stimulus (most often a [[Chinese character|Chinese pictograph]]) which they are asked to rate as either more or less, in this case visually, pleasing than an average stimulus.  During these trials, the positive or negative affect in response to the priming image is misattributed or '[[Psychological projection|projected]]' onto the neutral stimulus such that it is rated as more or less pleasing than would be expected from solitary presentation.&lt;ref name="ref17"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Payne | first1 = B.K. | last2 = Cheng | first2 = C.M. | last3 = Govorun | first3 = O. | last4 = Stewart | first4 = B.D. | year = 2005 | title = An inkblot for attitudes: Affective misattribution as implicit measurement | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 89 | issue = 3| pages = 277–293 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.89.3.277 | pmid=16248714}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neutral stimuli which are rated as more visually pleasing indicate that the preceding concept presented in the prime stimuli are associated with positive valence. A full demonstration of the AMP procedure can be found in the external links below.

The AMP has been used to study attitudes towards political candidates and has proven useful in predicting voting behavior.&lt;ref name="ref17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref18"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenwald | first1 = A.G. | last2 = Smith | first2 = C.T. | last3 = Sriram | first3 = N. | last4 = Bar-Anan | first4 = Y. | last5 = Nosek | first5 = B.A. | year = 2009 | title = Implicit race attitudes predicted vote in the 2008 U.S. presidential election | url = | journal = Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 241–253 | doi=10.1111/j.1530-2415.2009.01195.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the procedure is frequently used in the study of substance use; for example, attitudes towards cigarettes among smokers and non-smokers and attitudes towards alcohol among heavy drinkers.&lt;ref name="ref19"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Payne | first1 = B.K. | last2 = McClernon | first2 = F.J. | last3 = Dobbins | first3 = I.G. | year = 2007 | title = Automatic affective responses to smoking cues | url = | journal = [[Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology]] | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 400–409 | doi=10.1037/1064-1297.15.4.400}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref20"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Payne | first1 = B.K. | last2 = Govorun | first2 = O. | last3 = Arbuckle | first3 = N.L. | year = 2008 | title = Automatic attitudes and alcohol: Does implicit liking predict drinking? | url = | journal = Cognition &amp; Emotion | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 238–271 | doi=10.1080/02699930701357394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with explicit attitudes ==

=== Interaction of implicit and explicit attitude ===
The following are some examples of how implicit attitude and explicit attitude are moderated by each other and how they interact with each other.

==== Self presentation ====
Individuals will alter a response when questioned for personal or social purposes. This typically happens in situations where individuals are not willing to report or express their "affective response toward an object" because they don't want others to know how they feel about something (they don't consciously accept or endorse their evaluation). Since implicit measures are not as vulnerable to control as explicit measures are, the correlation between implicit and explicit attitudes should decrease as self presentation concerns increase. For example, Nosek (2005) found that there was more overlap in explicit and implicit measures when people rated Pepsi vs. Coca-Cola (low self presentation concern). However, when they rated thin vs. fat people (high self presentation concern), the correlation (or overlap) of implicit and explicit measure decreased.&lt;ref name="Psychology Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Devos|first1=T|title=Implicit Attitudes 101: Theoretical and empirical insight|date=2008|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York|pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Attitude strength ====
The strength of an attitude has an influence on explicit attitudes the stronger an implicit attitude the more likely it is that it will show up in an explicit attitude. Strong attitudes are stable and not easily changed due to persuasion and can therefore help predict behaviors. The more an individual expresses or acts on an attitude the stronger the attitude becomes and the more automated the attitude becomes. Attitude strength should increase the correspondence between implicit and explicit attitudes. Conscious thinking about the attitude should create more of an overlap between both implicit and explicit attitude.&lt;ref name="Psychology Press"/&gt;

=== Early focus on explicit attitudes ===
Much of the literature within the field of social psychology has focused on explicit constructions of the attitude construct.  Until more recently, examination of attitudes beyond reported awareness has lagged far behind that of explicit attitudes.  This point is driven home in a review of research in the mid 1990s which found that among attitudinal research published in 1989, approximately only 1 in 9 experimental paradigms utilized an [[Indirect tests of memory|indirect measure]] of attitude (necessary for determining contributions of implicit attitudes) while all of the reviewed studies employed direct measures such as [[Self-report inventory|self report]] of attitudes which were explicitly aware to participants.&lt;ref name="ref2"/&gt;

=== New ideas about implicit versus explicit attitudes ===
Newer research has called into question the distinction between implicit and explicit attitudes. Fazio &amp; Olson ask whether a person who is being primed to detect implicit attitudes is necessarily blind to their implicit beliefs.&lt;ref name="ref58"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fazio|first=Russell|author2=Michael Olson|title=Implicit Measures in Social Cognition Research: Their Meaning and Use|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=6 August 2002|volume=54|pages=297–327|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145225}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In their paper they bring up the question; just because a person is primed on an unconscious level and may indeed be answering on an unconscious level, does that not mean that they could still be aware of their attitudes nonetheless. "A second troublesome aspect of the implicit-explicit distinction is that it implies preexisting dual attitudes".&lt;ref name="ref58"/&gt; They go on to say there is not a known test capable of measuring explicit attitudes solely without the influence of implicit attitudes as well. However, they do go on to say that context can have a significant effect on this particular line of research. People's explicitly stated and implicitly tested attitudes are more likely to be in sync for trivial matters such as preference in a presidential election than for highly charged issues such as predispositions towards a certain race. They exert that "The more sensitive the domain, the greater the likelihood that motivational factors will be evoked and exert some influence on overt responses to an explicit measure".&lt;ref name=ref58 /&gt; In other words, it is easier to compare explicit and implicit attitudes on safe subjects than subjects where people are likely to mask their beliefs.

A prominent [[dual process theory]] specifying the relation between implicit and explicit attitudes is [[Bertram Gawronski|Gawronski]] and Bodenhausen's associative-propositional evaluation (APE) model.&lt;ref name="ref59"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gawronski | first1 = B. | last2 = Bodenhausen | first2 = G. V. | year = 2006 | title = Associative and propositional processes in evaluation: An integrative review of implicit and explicit attitude change | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 132 | issue = | pages = 692–731 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.132.5.692 | pmid=16910748}}&lt;/ref&gt; A central assumption of the APE model is that implicit and explicit evaluations are the product of two functionally distinct mental processes. Whereas implicit evaluations are assumed to be the outcome of associative processes, explicit evaluations are assumed to be the outcome of propositional processes. Associative processes are conceptualized as the activation of associations on the basis of feature similarity and spatio-temporal contiguity during learning. Propositional processes are defined as the validation of activated information on the basis of [[cognitive consistency]]. A central assumption of the APE model is that people tend to rely on their implicit evaluations when making explicit evaluative judgments to the extent that the implicit evaluative response is consistent with other momentarily considered propositional information. However, people may reject implicit evaluations for making explicit evaluative judgments when the implicit evaluative response is inconsistent with other momentarily considered propositional information. In addition to explaining the relation between implicit and explicit evaluations, the APE model accounts for diverging patterns of attitude change, including (a) changes in implicit but not explicit evaluations, (b) changes in explicit but not implicit evaluations, (c) corresponding changes in implicit and explicit evaluations, and (d) opposite changes in implicit and explicit evaluations.&lt;ref name="ref59"/&gt;

'''Internet access''' is the ability of individuals and organizations to connect to the [[Internet]] using [[computer terminal]]s, [[computer]]s, and other devices; and to access services such as [[email]] and the [[World Wide Web]]. Various technologies, at a [[data signaling rate|wide range of speeds]] have been used by [[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) to provide this service.

Internet access was once rare, but has grown rapidly. In 1995, only {{val|.04}} percent of the world's population had access, with well over half of those living in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907585907|title=The world transformed : 1945 to the present|last=H.|first=Hunt, Michael|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780199371020|location=|pages=431|oclc=907585907}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consumer use was through [[dial-up Internet access|dial-up]].

{{Main article |History of the Internet}}

The Internet developed from the [[ARPANET]], which was funded by the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] to support projects within the government and at universities and research laboratories in the US – but grew over time to include most of the world's large universities and the research arms of many technology companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ben Segal | title=A Short History of Internet Protocols at CERN | year=1995 | url=http://www.cern.ch/ben/TCPHIST.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[RIPE|Réseaux IP Européens]] (RIPE)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Internet History in Asia | work=16th APAN Meetings/Advanced Network Conference in Busan | url=http://www.apan.net/meetings/busan03/cs-history.htm | accessdate=25 December 2005 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060201035514/http://apan.net/meetings/busan03/cs-history.htm | archivedate=1 February 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use by a wider audience only came in 1995 when restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic were lifted.&lt;ref name=ConneXions-April1996&gt;[http://www.merit.edu/networkresearch/projecthistory/nsfnet/nsfnet_article.php "Retiring the NSFNET Backbone Service: Chronicling the End of an Era"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719235238/http://www.merit.edu/networkresearch/projecthistory/nsfnet/nsfnet_article.php |date=2011-07-19 }}, Susan R. Harris and Elise Gerich, ''ConneXions'', Vol. 10, No. 4, April 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early to mid-1980s, most Internet access was from [[personal computers]] and [[workstations]] directly connected to [[Local Area network|local area networks]] or from [[dial-up Internet access|dial-up connections]] using [[modems]] and analog [[telephone lines]]. LANs typically operated at 10 Mbit/s,&lt;!-- 100 Mbit/s only came in 1995 --&gt; while modem data-rates grew from 1200 bit/s in the early 1980s, to 56 kbit/s by the late 1990s. Initially, dial-up connections were made from [[Computer terminals|terminals]] or computers running [[Terminal emulator|terminal emulation software]] to [[terminal server]]s on LANs. These dial-up connections did not support end-to-end use of the Internet protocols and only provided terminal to host connections. The introduction of [[network access server]]s supporting the [[Serial Line Internet Protocol]] (SLIP) and later the [[point-to-point protocol]] (PPP) extended the Internet protocols and made the full range of Internet services available to dial-up users; although slower, due to the lower data rates available using dial-up.
 
Broadband Internet access, often shortened to just broadband, is simply defined as "Internet access that is always on, and faster than the traditional dial-up access"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= What is Broadband? |work= The National Broadband Plan |publisher= US Federal Communications Commission |url= http://www.broadband.gov/about_broadband.html/ |accessdate= July 15, 2011 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110713053907/http://www.broadband.gov/about_broadband.html |archivedate= July 13, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inquiry Concerning the Deployment of Advanced Telecommunications Capability to All Americans in a Reasonable and Timely Fashion, and Possible Steps to Accelerate Such Deployment Pursuant to Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as Amended by the Broadband Data Improvement Act |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |work=GN Docket No. 10-159, FCC-10-148A1 |date=August 6, 2010 |url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2010/db0806/FCC-10-148A1.pdf |accessdate=July 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721135629/http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2010/db0806/FCC-10-148A1.pdf |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and so covers a wide range of technologies. Broadband connections are typically made using a computer's built in [[Ethernet]] networking capabilities, or by using a [[Network interface controller|NIC]] [[expansion card]].

Most broadband services provide a continuous "always on" connection; there is no dial-in process required, and it does not interfere with voice use of phone lines.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks" /&gt; Broadband provides improved access to Internet services such as:
* Faster [[world wide web]] browsing
* Faster downloading of documents, photographs, videos, and other large files
* [[Internet telephony|Telephony]], [[Internet radio|radio]], [[Internet television|television]], and [[videoconferencing]]
* [[Virtual private network]]s and remote system administration
* [[Online game|Online gaming]], especially [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s which are interaction-intensive

In the 1990s, the [[National Information Infrastructure Protection Act|National Information Infrastructure]] initiative in the U.S. made broadband Internet access a public policy issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Jeffrey A.

By 2004, broadband had grown and dial-up had declined so that the number of subscriptions were roughly equal at 130 million each. In 2010, in the OECD countries, over 90% of the Internet access subscriptions used broadband, broadband had grown to more than 300 million subscriptions, and dial-up subscriptions had declined to fewer than 30 million.&lt;ref name=OCED-June2011&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/24/5/48255770.pdf ''The Future of the Internet Economy: A Statistical Profile''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616224428/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/24/5/48255770.pdf |date=2012-06-16 }}, Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The broadband technologies in widest use are [[ADSL]] and [[cable Internet]] access. Newer technologies include [[VDSL]] and [[optical fibre]] extended closer to the subscriber in both telephone and cable plants. [[Fibre-optic communication]], while only recently being used in [[fibre to the x|premises and to the curb]] schemes, has played a crucial role in enabling broadband Internet access by making transmission of information at very high data rates over longer distances much more cost-effective than copper wire technology.

In areas not served by ADSL or cable, some community organizations and local governments are installing [[Wi-Fi Protected Access|Wi-Fi]] networks. Wireless and satellite Internet are often used in rural, undeveloped, or other hard to serve areas where wired Internet is not readily available.

Newer technologies being deployed for fixed (stationary) and mobile broadband access include [[WiMAX]], [[3GPP Long Term Evolution|LTE]], and [[fixed wireless]], e.g., [[Motorola Canopy]].

Starting in roughly 2006, [[mobile broadband]] access is increasingly available at the consumer level using "[[3G]]" and "[[4G LTE|4G]]" technologies such as [[High-Speed Packet Access|HSPA]], [[Evolution-Data Optimized|EV-DO]], [[HSPA+]], and [[3GPP Long Term Evolution|LTE]].

==Availability==
In addition to access from home, school, and the workplace Internet access may be available from [[public place]]s such as [[libraries]] and [[Internet cafes]], where computers with Internet connections are available. Some libraries provide stations for physically connecting users' [[laptop]]s to [[local area network]]s (LANs).

Wireless Internet access points are available in public places such as airport halls, in some cases just for brief use while standing. Some access points may also provide coin-operated computers. Various terms are used, such as "public [[Internet kiosk]]", "public access terminal", and "Web [[payphone]]". Many hotels also have public terminals, usually fee based.

Coffee shops, shopping malls, and other venues increasingly offer wireless access to computer networks, referred to as [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspots]], for users who bring their own wireless-enabled devices such as a [[laptop]] or [[personal digital assistant|PDA]]. These services may be free to all, free to customers only, or fee-based. A [[Wi-Fi]] hotspot need not be limited to a confined location since multiple ones combined can cover a whole campus or park, or even an entire city can be enabled.

Additionally, [[Mobile broadband]] access allows [[smart phones]] and other digital devices to connect to the Internet from any location from which a [[mobile phone]] call can be made, subject to the capabilities of that mobile network.

{{Main article |Data rates | Bit rates |Bandwidth (computing) |Device data rates}}
The bit rates for dial-up [[modems]] range from as little as 110 bit/s in the late 1950s, to a maximum of from 33 to 64 kbit/s ([[V.90 (recommendation)|V.90]] and [[V.92]]) in the late 1990s. [[Dial-up Internet access|Dial-up connections]] generally require the dedicated use of a telephone line. Data compression can boost the effective bit rate for a dial-up modem connection to from 220 ([[V.42bis]]) to 320 ([[V.44]]) kbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fndcg0.fnal.gov/Net/modm8-94.txt |title=What You Need to Know about Modems |accessdate=2008-03-02 |last=Willdig |first=Karl |author2=Patrik Chen |date=August 1994 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104124418/http://fndcg0.fnal.gov/Net/modm8-94.txt |archivedate=2007-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the effectiveness of data compression is quite variable, depending on the type of data being sent, the condition of the telephone line, and a number of other factors. In reality, the overall data rate rarely exceeds 150 kbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pricenfees.com/digit-life-archives/modem-compression-v-44-v-42bis |title=Modem compression: V.44 against V.42bis |accessdate=2008-03-02 |last=Mitronov |first=Pavel |date=2001-06-29 |publisher=Pricenfees.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202062749/https://www.pricenfees.com/digit-life-archives/modem-compression-v-44-v-42bis |archivedate=2017-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadband technologies supply considerably higher bit rates than dial-up, generally without disrupting regular telephone use. Various minimum data rates and maximum latencies have been used in definitions of broadband, ranging from 64&amp;nbsp;kbit/s up to 4.0&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s.&lt;ref name="Birth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/osg/spu/publications/birthofbroadband/faq.html |title=Birth of Broadband |publisher=ITU |date=September 2003 |accessdate=July 12, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701173257/http://www.itu.int/osg/spu/publications/birthofbroadband/faq.html |archivedate=July 1, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 the [[ITU-T|CCITT]] standards body defined "broadband service" as requiring transmission channels capable of supporting [[bit rate]]s greater than the [[Primary Rate Interface|primary rate]] which ranged from about 1.5 to 2&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&amp;id=T-REC-I.113-199706-I!!PDF-E |title= Recommendation I.113, Vocabulary of Terms for Broadband aspects of ISDN |publisher= ITU-T |date= June 1997 |orig-year= originally 1988 |accessdate= 19 July 2011 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121106141554/http://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&amp;id=T-REC-I.113-199706-I!!PDF-E |archivedate= 6 November 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) report defined broadband as having download [[data transfer rates]] equal to or faster than 256&amp;nbsp;kbit/s.&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/broadband.html |title=2006 OECD Broadband Statistics to December 2006 |publisher=OECD |accessdate=June 6, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507202240/http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/broadband.html |archivedate=May 7, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; And in 2015 the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) defined "Basic Broadband" as data transmission speeds of at least 25 Mbit/s downstream (from the Internet to the user’s [[computer]]) and 3&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s upstream (from the user’s computer to the Internet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-331760A1.pdf |title=FCC Finds U.S. Broadband Deployment Not Keeping Pace |publisher=FCC |accessdate=January 29, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419074040/https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-331760A1.pdf |archivedate=April 19, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trend is to raise the threshold of the broadband definition as higher data rate services become available.&lt;ref name="engadget08"&gt;{{cite web |first=Nilay |last=Patel |url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/03/19/fcc-redefines-broadband-to-mean-768kbps-fast-to-mean-kinda/ |title=FCC redefines "broadband" to mean 768&amp;nbsp;kbit/s, "fast" to mean "kinda slow" |publisher=Engadget |date=March 19, 2008 |accessdate=June 6, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213175111/http://www.engadget.com/2008/03/19/fcc-redefines-broadband-to-mean-768kbps-fast-to-mean-kinda |archivedate=February 13, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher data rate dial-up modems and many broadband services are "asymmetric"—supporting much higher data rates for download (toward the user) than for upload (toward the Internet).

Data rates, including those given in this article, are usually defined and advertised in terms of the maximum or peak download rate. In practice, these maximum data rates are not always reliably available to the customer.&lt;ref name="100mb"/&gt; Actual end-to-end data rates can be lower due to a number of factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Tom Phillips |title= 'Misleading' BT broadband ad banned |work= UK Metro |date= August 25, 2010 |url= http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/839014-misleading-bt-broadband-ad-banned |accessdate= July 24, 2011 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110906220840/http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/839014-misleading-bt-broadband-ad-banned |archivedate= September 6, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late June 2016, internet connection speeds averaged about 6 Mbit/s globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ben Munson |title=Akamai: Global average internet speeds have doubled since last Olympics |work=FierceOnlineVideo |date=June 29, 2016 |url=http://www.fierceonlinevideo.com/story/akamai-global-average-internet-speeds-have-doubled-last-olympics/2016-06-29 |accessdate=June 30, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702073650/http://www.fierceonlinevideo.com/story/akamai-global-average-internet-speeds-have-doubled-last-olympics/2016-06-29 |archivedate=July 2, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical link quality can vary with distance and for wireless access with terrain, weather, building construction, antenna placement, and interference from other radio sources. Network bottlenecks may exist at points anywhere on the path from the end-user to the remote server or service being used and not just on the first or last link providing Internet access to the end-user.

===Network congestion===
Users may share access over a common network infrastructure. Since most users do not use their full connection capacity all of the time, this aggregation strategy (known as [[contended service]]) usually works well and users can burst to their full data rate at least for brief periods. However, [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) [[file sharing]] and high-quality streaming video can require high data-rates for extended periods, which violates these assumptions and can cause a service to become oversubscribed, resulting in congestion and poor performance. The TCP protocol includes flow-control mechanisms that automatically throttle back on the bandwidth being used during periods of [[network congestion]]. This is fair in the sense that all users that experience congestion receive less bandwidth, but it can be frustrating for customers and a major problem for ISPs. In some cases the amount of bandwidth actually available may fall below the threshold required to support a particular service such as video conferencing or streaming live video–effectively making the service unavailable.

When traffic is particularly heavy, an ISP can deliberately throttle back the bandwidth available to classes of users or for particular services. This is known as [[traffic shaping]] and careful use can ensure a better [[quality of service]] for time critical services even on extremely busy networks. However, overuse can lead to concerns about fairness and [[network neutrality]] or even charges of [[censorship]], when some types of traffic are severely or completely blocked.

===Outages===
An Internet blackout or outage can be caused by local signaling interruptions. Disruptions of [[submarine communications cable]]s may cause blackouts or slowdowns to large areas, such as in the [[2008 submarine cable disruption]].  Less-developed countries are more vulnerable due to a small number of high-capacity links.  Land cables are also vulnerable, as in 2011 when a woman digging for scrap metal severed most connectivity for the nation of Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/06/georgian-woman-cuts-web-access|title=Georgian woman cuts off web access to whole of Armenia|date=6 April 2011|accessdate=11 April 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825075603/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/06/georgian-woman-cuts-web-access|archivedate=25 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet blackouts affecting almost entire countries can be achieved by governments as a form of [[Internet censorship]], as in the blockage of the [[Internet in Egypt]], whereby approximately 93%&lt;ref name="renesys1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cowie |first=James |title=Egypt Leaves the Internet |publisher=Renesys |url=http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet.shtml |accessdate=28 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w51j0pga?url=http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet.shtml |archivedate=28 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; of networks were without access in 2011 in an attempt to stop mobilization for [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|anti-government protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12306041 | work=BBC News | title=Egypt severs internet connection amid growing unrest | date=28 January 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123164134/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12306041 | archivedate=23 January 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technologies==
When the Internet is accessed using a [[modem]], [[digital data]] is converted to [[analog signal|analog]] for transmission over analog networks such as the [[Public switched telephone network|telephone]] and [[Cable television|cable]] networks.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks"&gt;[http://www.explainthatstuff.com/howbroadbandworks.html "How Broadband Works"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913021130/http://www.explainthatstuff.com//howbroadbandworks.html |date=2011-09-13 }}, Chris Woodford, Explain that Stuff, 20 August 2008. Retrieved 19 January.&lt;/ref&gt; A computer or other device accessing the Internet would either be connected directly to a modem that communicates with an [[Internet service provider]] (ISP) or the modem's Internet connection would be shared via a [[Local Area Network]] (LAN) which provides access in a limited area such as a home, school, computer laboratory, or office building.

Although a connection to a LAN may provide very high data-rates within the LAN, actual Internet access speed is limited by the upstream link to the ISP. LANs may be wired or wireless. [[Ethernet]] over [[twisted pair]] cabling and [[Wi-Fi]] are the two most common technologies used to build LANs today, but [[ARCNET]], [[Token Ring]], [[Localtalk]], [[FDDI]], and other technologies were used in the past.

[[Ethernet]] is the name of the [[IEEE 802.3]] standard for physical LAN communication&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://standards.ieee.org/about/get/802/802.3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170124030206/http://standards.ieee.org/about/get/802/802.3.html |archivedate=2017-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wi-Fi]] is a trade name for a [[wireless local area network]] (WLAN) that uses one of the [[IEEE 802.11]] standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Wi-Fi (wireless networking technology)|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1473553/Wi-Fi|accessdate=2010-02-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627181935/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1473553/Wi-Fi|archivedate=2010-06-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethernet cables are interconnected via switches &amp; routers. Wi-Fi networks are built using one or more wireless antenna called [[Wireless access point|access points]].

Many "modems" provide the additional functionality to host a LAN so most Internet access today is through a LAN{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}, often a very small LAN with just one or two devices attached. And while LANs are an important form of Internet access, this raises the question of how and at what data rate the LAN itself is connected to the rest of the global Internet. The technologies described below are used to make these connections.

===Hardwired broadband access===

The term [[broadband]] includes a broad range of technologies, all of which provide higher data rate access to the Internet. The following technologies use wires or cables in contrast to wireless broadband described later.

====Dial-up access====
{{Listen

|title = "Dial up modem noises"
|description = Typical noises of a [[dial-up|dial-up modem]] while establishing connection with a local [[Internet service provider|ISP]] in order to get access to the [[Internet]].
|pos=right}}
[[Dial-up Internet access]] uses a modem and a phone call placed over the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) to connect to a pool of modems operated by an ISP. The [[modem]] converts a computer's digital signal into an analog signal that travels over a phone line's [[local loop]] until it reaches a telephone company's switching facilities or central office (CO) where it is switched to another phone line that connects to another modem at the remote end of the connection.&lt;ref name=Network&gt;{{cite book|last=Dean|first=Tamara|title=Network+ Guide to Networks, 5th Ed|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operating on a single channel, a dial-up connection monopolizes the phone line and is one of the slowest methods of accessing the Internet. Dial-up is often the only form of Internet access available in rural areas as it requires no new infrastructure beyond the already existing telephone network, to connect to the Internet. Typically, dial-up connections do not exceed a speed of 56 [[kbit/s]], as they are primarily made using modems that operate at a maximum data rate of 56 kbit/s downstream (towards the end user) and 34 or 48 kbit/s upstream (toward the global Internet).&lt;ref name="howstuffworks" /&gt;

====Multilink dial-up====
[[Multilink striping|Multilink]] dial-up provides increased bandwidth by [[channel bonding]] multiple dial-up connections and accessing them as a single data channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.56k.com/reports/bonding.shtml "Bonding: 112K, 168K, and beyond "] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310194539/http://www.56k.com/reports/bonding.shtml |date=2007-03-10 }}, 56K.com&lt;/ref&gt; It requires two or more modems, phone lines, and dial-up accounts, as well as an ISP that supports multilinking – and of course any line and data charges are also doubled. This [[inverse multiplexing]] option was briefly popular with some high-end users before ISDN, DSL and other technologies became available. [[Diamond Multimedia|Diamond]] and other vendors created special modems to support multilinking.&lt;ref name="fail"&gt;[http://www.maximumpc.com/article/features/top_tech_blunders_10_products_massively_failed "Diamond 56k Shotgun Modem"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331173853/http://www.maximumpc.com/article/features/top_tech_blunders_10_products_massively_failed |date=2012-03-31 }}, maximumpc.com&lt;/ref&gt;

====Integrated Services Digital Network====
[[Integrated Services Digital Network]] (ISDN) is a switched telephone service capable of transporting voice and digital data, as well as one of the oldest Internet access methods. ISDN has been used for voice, video conferencing, and broadband data applications. ISDN was very popular in Europe, but less common in North America. Its use peaked in the late 1990s before the availability of [[DSL]] and [[cable modem]] technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Stallings |title=ISDN and Broadband ISDN with Frame Relay and ATM |edition=4th |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1999 |page=542 |isbn=0139737448 |url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/ISDN-and-Broadband-ISDN-with-Frame-Relay-and-ATM-4E/9780139737442.page |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924071103/http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/ISDN-and-Broadband-ISDN-with-Frame-Relay-and-ATM-4E/9780139737442.page |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic rate ISDN, known as ISDN-BRI, has two 64 kbit/s "bearer" or "B" channels. These channels can be used separately for voice or data calls or bonded together to provide a 128&amp;nbsp;kbit/s service. Multiple ISDN-BRI lines can be bonded together to provide data rates above 128&amp;nbsp;kbit/s. Primary rate ISDN, known as ISDN-PRI, has 23 bearer channels (64&amp;nbsp;kbit/s each) for a combined data rate of 1.5&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s (US standard). An ISDN E1 (European standard) line has 30 bearer channels and a combined data rate of 1.9&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s.

====Leased lines====
[[Leased line]]s are dedicated lines used primarily by ISPs, business, and other large enterprises to connect LANs and campus networks to the Internet using the existing infrastructure of the [[Public switched telephone network|public telephone network]] or other providers. Delivered using wire, [[optical fiber]], and [[radio]], leased lines are used to provide Internet access directly as well as the building blocks from which several other forms of Internet access are created.&lt;ref name="Horak"&gt;[http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470396075.html ''Telecommunications and Data Communications Handbook''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308075758/http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470396075.html |date=2013-03-08 }}, Ray Horak, 2nd edition, Wiley-Interscience, 2008, 791 p., {{ISBN|0-470-39607-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[T-carrier]] technology dates to 1957 and provides data rates that range from 56 and {{val|64|u=kbit/s}} ([[Digital Signal 0|DS0]]) to {{val|1.5|u=Mbit/s}} ([[Digital Signal 1|DS1]] or T1), to {{val|45|u=Mbit/s}} ([[Digital Signal 3|DS3]] or T3). A T1 line carries 24 voice or data channels (24 DS0s), so customers may use some channels for data and others for voice traffic or use all 24 channels for clear channel data. A DS3 (T3) line carries 28 DS1 (T1) channels. Fractional T1 lines are also available in multiples of a DS0 to provide data rates between 56 and {{val|1,500|u=kbit/s}}. T-carrier lines require special termination equipment that may be separate from or integrated into a router or switch and which may be purchased or leased from an ISP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dean|first=Tamara|title=Network+ Guide to Networks|edition=5th|publisher=Course Technology, Cengage Learning|year=2009|url=http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?N=0&amp;Ntk=P_Isbn13&amp;Ntt=9781423902454|ISBN=1-4239-0245-9|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420223256/http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?N=0&amp;Ntk=P_Isbn13&amp;Ntt=9781423902454|archivedate=2013-04-20|df=}} pp 312–315.&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan the equivalent standard is J1/J3. In Europe, a slightly different standard, [[E-carrier]], provides 32 user channels ({{val|64|u=kbit/s}}) on an E1 ({{val|2.0|u=Mbit/s}}) and 512 user channels or 16 E1s on an E3 ({{val|34.4|u=Mbit/s}}).

[[Synchronous Optical Networking]] (SONET, in the U.S. and Canada) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH, in the rest of the world) are the standard multiplexing protocols used to carry high-data-rate digital bit-streams over optical fiber using [[lasers]] or highly [[coherent light]] from [[light-emitting diodes]] (LEDs). At lower transmission rates data can also be transferred via an electrical interface. The basic unit of framing is an [[OC-3c]] (optical) or [[Synchronous optical networking#The basic unit of transmission|STS-3]]c (electrical) which carries {{val|155.520|u=Mbit/s}}. Thus an OC-3c will carry three [[Optical Carrier#OC-1|OC-1]] (51.84 Mbit/s) payloads each of which has enough capacity to include a full DS3. Higher data rates are delivered in OC-3c multiples of four providing [[OC-12]]c ({{val|622.080|u=Mbit/s}}), [[OC-48]]c ({{val|2.488|u=Gbit/s}}), [[OC-192]]c ({{val|9.953|u=Gbit/s}}), and [[OC-768]]c (39.813 Gbit/s). The "c" at the end of the OC labels stands for "concatenated" and indicates a single data stream rather than several multiplexed data streams.&lt;ref name="Horak" /&gt;

The 1, 10, 40, and 100 gigabit Ethernet ([[GbE]], [[10 GbE]], [[100 Gigabit Ethernet|40/100 GbE]]) [[IEEE 802.3|IEEE standards (802.3)]] allow digital data to be delivered over copper wiring at distances to 100 m and over optical fiber at distances to {{val|40|u=km}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee802.org/3/ "IEEE 802.3 Ethernet Working Group"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012182235/http://www.ieee802.org/3/ |date=2014-10-12 }}, web page, IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee, accessed 8 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cable Internet access====
{{main article|Cable Internet access}}
Cable Internet provides access using a [[cable modem]] on [[Hybrid fibre-coaxial|hybrid fiber coaxial]] wiring originally developed to carry television signals. Either fiber-optic or coaxial copper cable may connect a node to a customer's location at a connection known as a cable drop. In a [[cable modem termination system]], all nodes for cable subscribers in a neighborhood connect to a cable company's central office, known as the "head end." The cable company then connects to the Internet using a variety of means – usually fiber optic cable or digital satellite and microwave transmissions.&lt;ref name="Dean322"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dean|first=Tamara|title=Network+ Guide to Networks|edition=5th|publisher=Course Technology, Cengage Learning|year=2009|url=http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?N=0&amp;Ntk=P_Isbn13&amp;Ntt=9781423902454|ISBN=1-4239-0245-9|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420223256/http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?N=0&amp;Ntk=P_Isbn13&amp;Ntt=9781423902454|archivedate=2013-04-20|df=}} p 322.&lt;/ref&gt; Like DSL, broadband cable provides a continuous connection with an ISP.

[[Downstream (computer science)|Downstream]], the direction toward the user, bit rates can be as much as 400&amp;nbsp;[[Mbit/s]] for business connections, and 320&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s for residential service in some countries. Upstream traffic, originating at the user, ranges from 384&amp;nbsp;kbit/s to more than 20&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s. Broadband cable access tends to service fewer business customers because existing television cable networks tend to service residential buildings and commercial buildings do not always include wiring for coaxial cable networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dean|first=Tamara|title=Network+ Guide to Networks|edition=5th|publisher=Course Technology, Cengage Learning|year=2009|url=http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?N=0&amp;Ntk=P_Isbn13&amp;Ntt=9781423902454|ISBN=1-4239-0245-9|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420223256/http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?N=0&amp;Ntk=P_Isbn13&amp;Ntt=9781423902454|archivedate=2013-04-20|df=}} p 323.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, because broadband cable subscribers share the same local line, communications may be intercepted by neighboring subscribers. Cable networks regularly provide encryption schemes for data traveling to and from customers, but these schemes may be thwarted.&lt;ref name="Dean322"/&gt;

====Digital subscriber line (DSL, ADSL, SDSL, and VDSL)====
[[Digital Subscriber Line]] (DSL) service provides a connection to the Internet through the telephone network. Unlike dial-up, DSL can operate using a single phone line without preventing normal use of the telephone line for voice phone calls. DSL uses the high frequencies, while the low (audible) frequencies of the line are left free for [[Plain old telephone service|regular telephone]] communication.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks" /&gt; These frequency bands are subsequently separated by filters installed at the customer's premises.

DSL originally stood for "digital subscriber loop". In telecommunications marketing, the term digital subscriber line is widely understood to mean [[Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line]] (ADSL), the most commonly installed variety of DSL. The data throughput of consumer DSL services typically ranges from 256&amp;nbsp;kbit/s to 20&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s in the direction to the customer (downstream), depending on DSL technology, line conditions, and service-level implementation. In ADSL, the data throughput in the upstream direction, (i.e. in the direction to the service provider) is lower than that in the downstream direction (i.e. to the customer), hence the designation of asymmetric.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whirlpool.net.au/wiki/?tag=ADSL_Theory "ADSL Theory"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724040222/http://whirlpool.net.au/wiki/?tag=ADSL_Theory |date=2010-07-24 }}, Australian broadband news and information, Whirlpool, accessed 3 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; With a [[symmetric digital subscriber line]] (SDSL), the downstream and upstream data rates are equal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/Digital_Subscriber_Line#SDSL "SDSL"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418172858/http://docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/Digital_Subscriber_Line |date=2012-04-18 }}, ''Internetworking Technology Handbook'', Cisco DocWiki, 17 December 2009, accessed 3 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[VDSL2]] (ITU-T G.993.2) is a second-generation version and an enhancement of VDSL.&lt;ref name="press"&gt;{{Cite news |title= New ITU Standard Delivers 10x ADSL Speeds: Vendors applaud landmark agreement on VDSL2 |date= 27 May 2005 |work= News release |publisher= International Telecommunication Union |url= http://www.itu.int/newsroom/press_releases/2005/06.html |accessdate= 22 September 2011 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160903203113/http://www.itu.int/newsroom/press_releases/2005/06.html |archivedate= 3 September 2016 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approved in February 2006, it is able to provide data rates exceeding 100&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s simultaneously in both the upstream and downstream directions. However, the maximum data rate is achieved at a range of about 300 meters and performance degrades as distance and loop [[attenuation]] increases.

====DSL Rings====
[[DSL Rings]] (DSLR) or Bonded DSL Rings is a ring topology that uses DSL technology over existing copper telephone wires to provide data rates of up to 400&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s.&lt;ref name="financialpost"&gt;{{cite news

====Fiber to the home====
[[Fiber to the x|Fiber-to-the-home]] (FTTH) is one member of the Fiber-to-the-x (FTTx) family that includes Fiber-to-the-building or basement (FTTB), Fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP), Fiber-to-the-desk (FTTD), Fiber-to-the-curb (FTTC), and Fiber-to-the-node (FTTN).&lt;ref name="council"&gt;{{cite web |title= FTTH Council – Definition of Terms |date= January 9, 2009 |url= http://ftthcouncil.eu/documents/Reports/FTTH-Definitions-Revision_January_2009.pdf |publisher= FTTH Council |accessdate= September 1, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These methods all bring data closer to the end user on optical fibers. The differences between the methods have mostly to do with just how close to the end user the delivery on fiber comes. All of these delivery methods are similar to [[hybrid fiber-coaxial]] (HFC) systems used to provide [[cable Internet access]].

The use of [[Fiber-optic communication|optical fiber]] offers much higher data rates over relatively longer distances. Most high-capacity Internet and cable television backbones already use fiber optic technology, with data switched to other technologies (DSL, cable, [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]]) for final delivery to customers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiopt.com/primer.php "FTTx Primer"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011033903/http://www.fiopt.com/primer.php |date=2008-10-11 }}, Fiopt Communication Services (Calgary), July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

====Power-line Internet====
[[Power-line Internet]], also known as [[Broadband over power lines]] (BPL), carries Internet data on a conductor that is also used for [[electric power transmission]].&lt;ref name="BERGU14"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Lars T.|last2=Schwager|first2=Andreas |last3=Pagani|first3=Pascal|last4=Schneider|first4=Daniel M.|date=February 2014|title=MIMO Power Line Communications: Narrow and Broadband Standards, EMC, and Advanced Processing|publisher=CRC Press|series=Devices, Circuits, and Systems|isbn=9781466557529|url=http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1201/b16540-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the extensive power line infrastructure already in place, this technology can provide people in rural and low population areas access to the Internet with little cost in terms of new transmission equipment, cables, or wires. Data rates are asymmetric and generally range from 256 kbit/s to 2.7 Mbit/s.&lt;ref name="HSW-BPL"&gt;[http://computer.howstuffworks.com/bpl.htm "How Broadband Over Powerlines Works"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512090550/http://computer.howstuffworks.com/bpl.htm |date=2012-05-12 }}, Robert Valdes, ''How Stuff Works'', accessed 5 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Because these systems use parts of the radio spectrum allocated to other over-the-air communication services, interference between the services is a limiting factor in the introduction of power-line Internet systems. The [[IEEE P1901]] standard specifies that all power-line protocols must detect existing usage and avoid interfering with it.&lt;ref name="HSW-BPL" /&gt;

Power-line Internet has developed faster in Europe than in the U.S. due to a historical difference in power system design philosophies. Data signals cannot pass through the step-down transformers used and so a repeater must be installed on each transformer.&lt;ref name="HSW-BPL" /&gt; In the U.S. a transformer serves a small cluster of from one to a few houses. In Europe, it is more common for a somewhat larger transformer to service larger clusters of from 10 to 100 houses. Thus a typical U.S. city requires an order of magnitude more repeaters than in a comparable European city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://electrical-engineering-portal.com/north-american-versus-european-distribution-systems "North American versus European distribution systems"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507211603/http://electrical-engineering-portal.com/north-american-versus-european-distribution-systems |date=2012-05-07 }}, Edvard, Technical articles, Electrical Engineering Portal, 17 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====ATM and Frame Relay====
[[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) and [[Frame Relay]] are wide-area networking standards that can be used to provide Internet access directly or as building blocks of other access technologies. For example, many DSL implementations use an ATM layer over the low-level bitstream layer to enable a number of different technologies over the same link. Customer LANs are typically connected to an ATM switch or a Frame Relay node using leased lines at a wide range of data rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&amp;id=T-REC-I.150-199902-I!!PDF-E&amp;type=items ''B-ISDN asynchronous transfer mode functional characteristics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012161801/http://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&amp;id=T-REC-I.150-199902-I!!PDF-E&amp;type=items |date=2012-10-12 }}, ITU-T Recommendation I.150, February 1999, International Telecommunications Union&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchenterprisewan.techtarget.com/definition/frame-relay "Frame Relay"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409171824/http://searchenterprisewan.techtarget.com/definition/frame-relay |date=2012-04-09 }}, Margaret Rouse, TechTarget, September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

While still widely used, with the advent of Ethernet over optical fiber, [[MPLS]], [[VPN]]s and broadband services such as [[cable modem]] and [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]], ATM and Frame Relay no longer play the prominent role they once did.

===Wireless broadband access===
[[Wireless broadband]] is used to provide both fixed and mobile Internet access with the following technologies.

====Satellite broadband====
[[File:Ghana satellite.jpg|thumb|Satellite Internet access via [[VSAT]] in Ghana]]

[[Satellite Internet access]] provides fixed, portable, and mobile Internet access.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Fall99/Coffey/ "Internet in the Sky"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121216120858/http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Fall99/Coffey/ |date=2012-12-16 }}, D.J.

In the northern hemisphere, satellite antenna dishes require a clear line of sight to the southern sky, due to the equatorial position of all geostationary satellites. In the southern hemisphere, this situation is reversed, and dishes are pointed north.&lt;ref name=how&gt;[http://computer.howstuffworks.com/question606.htm "How does satellite Internet operate?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927053708/http://computer.howstuffworks.com/question606.htm |date=2011-09-27 }}, How Stuff Works, Retrieved 5 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=geostationary&gt;{{cite web| url=http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/definition/geostationary-satellite| title=Geostationary Satellite Definition| author=Margaret Rouse| publisher=Search Mobile Computing| access-date=June 24, 2015| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610040610/http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/definition/geostationary-satellite| archivedate=June 10, 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Service can be adversely affected by moisture, rain, and snow (known as rain fade).&lt;ref name=how/&gt;&lt;ref name=geostationary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/definition/rain-fade| title=Rain Fade Definition| author=Margaret Rouse| publisher=Search Mobile Computing| access-date=June 24, 2015| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622005223/http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/definition/rain-fade| archivedate=June 22, 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system requires a carefully aimed directional antenna.&lt;ref name=geostationary/&gt;

Satellites in geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) operate in a fixed position 35,786&amp;nbsp;km (22,236 miles) above the Earth's equator. At the speed of light (about 300,000&amp;nbsp;km/s or 186,000 miles per second), it takes a quarter of a second for a radio signal to travel from the Earth to the satellite and back. When other switching and routing delays are added and the delays are doubled to allow for a full round-trip transmission, the total delay can be 0.75 to 1.25 seconds. This latency is large when compared to other forms of Internet access with typical latencies that range from 0.015 to 0.2 seconds. Long latencies negatively affect some applications that require real-time response, particularly online games, [[voice over IP]], and remote control devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Basics of Satellite Communication| author=Joseph N.

Satellites in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO, below 2000&amp;nbsp;km or 1243 miles) and [[medium Earth orbit]] (MEO, between 2000 and 35,786&amp;nbsp;km or 1,243 and 22,236 miles) are less common, operate at lower altitudes, and are not fixed in their position above the Earth. Lower altitudes allow lower latencies and make real-time interactive Internet applications more feasible. LEO systems include [[Globalstar]] and [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium]]. The [[O3b (satellite)|O3b Satellite Constellation]] is a proposed MEO system with a latency of 125 ms. COMMStellation™ is a LEO system, scheduled for launch in 2015, that is expected to have a latency of just 7&amp;nbsp;ms.

====Mobile broadband====
[[File:Mobile Broadband service mark.jpg|thumb |150px |Service mark for [[GSM Association|GSMA]] ]]
[[Mobile broadband]] is the marketing term for wireless Internet access delivered through mobile phone towers to computers, [[mobile phone]]s (called "cell phones" in North America and South Africa, and "hand phones" in Asia), and other digital devices using [[portable modem]]s. Some mobile services allow more than one device to be connected to the Internet using a single cellular connection using a process called [[tethering]]. The modem may be built into laptop computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices, added to some devices using [[PC card]]s, [[USB modem]]s, and [[USB sticks]] or [[PC Card dongle|dongles]], or separate [[wireless modem]]s can be used.&lt;ref name="ergen"&gt;{{cite book |title= Mobile Broadband: including WiMAX and LTE |publisher= Springer Science+Business Media |year= 2009 |author= Mustafa Ergen |isbn= 978-0-387-68189-4 |url= http://www.springerlink.com/content/978-0-387-68189-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New mobile phone technology and infrastructure is introduced periodically and generally involves a change in the fundamental nature of the service, non-backwards-compatible transmission technology, higher peak data rates, new frequency bands, wider channel frequency bandwidth in Hertz becomes available. These transitions are referred to as generations. The first mobile data services became available during the second generation (2G).

[[WiMAX]] was originally developed to deliver fixed wireless service with wireless mobility added in 2005. CDPD, CDMA2000 EV-DO, and MBWA are no longer being actively developed.

In 2011, 90% of the world's population lived in areas with 2G coverage, while 45% lived in areas with 2G and 3G coverage.&lt;ref name=ITU-ITCFacts&gt;[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/facts/2011/material/ICTFactsFigures2011.pdf "The World in 2011: ITC Facts and Figures"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510070621/http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/facts/2011/material/ICTFactsFigures2011.pdf |date=2012-05-10 }}, International Telecommunications Unions (ITU), Geneva, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====WiMAX====
Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access ([[WiMAX]]) is a set of interoperable implementations of the [[IEEE 802.16]] family of wireless-network standards certified by the [[WiMAX Forum]]. WiMAX enables "the delivery of [[last mile]] wireless broadband access as an alternative to cable and DSL".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimaxforum.org/technology/ |title=WiMax Forum – Technology |accessdate=2008-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080722062158/http://www.wimaxforum.org/technology/ |archivedate=2008-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original IEEE 802.16 standard, now called "Fixed WiMAX", was published in 2001 and provided 30 to 40 megabit-per-second data rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.itbusinessedge.com/cm/community/features/interviews/blog/speeding-up-wimax/?cs=40726 |title= Speeding Up WiMax |author= Carl Weinschenk |date= 16 April 2010 |work= IT Business Edge |quote= Today the initial WiMax system is designed to provide 30 to 40 megabit-per-second data rates. |accessdate= 31 August 2011 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110905081903/http://www.itbusinessedge.com/cm/community/features/interviews/blog/speeding-up-wimax/?cs=40726 |archivedate= 5 September 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobility support was added in 2005. A 2011 update provides data rates up to 1 Gbit/s for fixed stations. WiMax offers a metropolitan area network with a signal radius of about 50&amp;nbsp;km (30 miles), far surpassing the 30-metre (100-foot) wireless range of a conventional [[Wi-Fi]] [[local area network]] (LAN). WiMAX signals also penetrate building walls much more effectively than Wi-Fi.

====Wireless ISP====
[[File:Wi-Fi Logo.svg|thumb|150px|Wi-Fi logo]]
[[Wireless Internet service provider]]s (WISPs) operate independently of [[mobile phone operator]]s. WISPs typically employ low-cost IEEE 802.11 [[Wi-Fi]] radio systems to link up remote locations over great distances ([[Long-range Wi-Fi]]), but may use other higher-power radio communications systems as well.

Traditional 802.11a/b/g/n/ac is an unlicensed omnidirectional service designed to span between 100 and 150 m (300 to 500&amp;nbsp;ft). By focusing the radio signal using a [[directional antenna]] (where allowed by regulations), 802.11 can operate reliably over a distance of many km(miles), although the technology's line-of-sight requirements hamper connectivity in areas with hilly or heavily foliated terrain. In addition, compared to hard-wired connectivity, there are security risks (unless robust security protocols are enabled); data rates are usually slower (2 to 50 times slower); and the network can be less stable, due to interference from other wireless devices and networks, weather and line-of-sight problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Certified Wireless Network Administrator Official Study Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QnMunBGVDuMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cwna+official+study+guide&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EJaXTpSaFMPSiALTu4HCDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=Joshua Bardwell|author2=Devin Akin|page=418|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|year=2005|edition=Third|isbn=978-0-07-225538-6|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109135240/https://books.google.com/books?id=QnMunBGVDuMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cwna+official+study+guide&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EJaXTpSaFMPSiALTu4HCDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=2017-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increasing popularity of unrelated consumer devices operating on the same 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz band, many providers have migrated to the [[List of WLAN channels#5.C2.A0GHz .28802.11a.2Fh.2Fj.2Fn.2Fac.29.5B18.5D|5GHz ISM band]]. If the service provider holds the necessary spectrum license, it could also reconfigure various brands of off the shelf Wi-Fi hardware to operate on its own band instead of the crowded unlicensed ones. Using higher frequencies carries various advantages:
* usually regulatory bodies allow for more power and using (better-) directional antennae,
* there exists much more bandwidth to share, allowing both better throughput and improved coexistence,
* there are less consumer devices that operate over 5&amp;nbsp;GHz than on 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz, hence less interferers are present,
* the shorter wavelengths propagate much worse through walls and other structure, so much less interference leaks outside of the homes of consumers.

Proprietary technologies like [[Motorola Canopy]] &amp; Expedience can be used by a WISP to offer wireless access to rural and other markets that are hard to reach using Wi-Fi or WiMAX. There are a number of companies that provide this service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wispa.org/directories/member-directory "Member Directory"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220031021/http://www.wispa.org/Directories/Member-Directory |date=2017-02-20 }}, Wireless Internet Service Providers’ Association (WISPA), accessed 5 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

====Local Multipoint Distribution Service====
[[Local Multipoint Distribution Service]] (LMDS) is a broadband wireless access technology that uses microwave signals operating between 26&amp;nbsp;GHz and 29&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cis788-99/ftp/lmds/index.html "Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LDMS)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010031040/http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cis788-99/ftp/lmds/index.html |date=2012-10-10 }}, Vinod Tipparaju, November 23, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Originally designed for digital television transmission (DTV), it is conceived as a fixed wireless, point-to-multipoint technology for utilization in the last mile. Data rates range from 64 kbit/s to 155 Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/nd/ramdinchacha/DEC00.html "LMDS: Broadband Out of Thin Air "] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415040102/http://www.angelfire.com/nd/ramdinchacha/DEC00.html |date=2014-04-15 }}, Niraj K Gupta, from My Cell, Voice &amp; Data, December 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Distance is typically limited to about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}}, but links of up to 5 miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) from the base station are possible in some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijest.info/docs/IJEST09-01-01.pdf "Review and Analysis of Local Multipoint Distribution System (LMDS) to Deliver Voice, Data, Internet, and Video Services"], S.S. Riaz Ahamed, International Journal of Engineering Science and Technology, Vol. 1(1), October 2009, pp. 1–7&lt;/ref&gt;

LMDS has been surpassed in both technological and commercial potential by the LTE and WiMAX standards.

===Hybrid Access Networks===
{{See also |Hybrid Access Networks}}

In some regions, notably in rural areas, the length of the copper lines makes it difficult for network operators to provide high bandwidth services. An alternative is to combine a fixed access network, typically [[XDSL]], with a wireless network, typically [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]. The [[Broadband Forum]] has standardised an architecture for such [[Hybrid Access Networks]].

===Non-commercial alternatives for using Internet services===
{{See also |Project Loon}}

====Grassroots wireless networking movements====
Deploying multiple adjacent Wi-Fi access points is sometimes used to create [[Municipal wireless network|city-wide]] wireless networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.wi-fi.org/discover-and-learn | title = Discover and Learn | publisher = The Wi-Fi Alliance | accessdate = 6 May 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120510032811/http://www.wi-fi.org/discover-and-learn | archivedate = 10 May 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually ordered by the local municipality from commercial WISPs.

[[Grassroots]] efforts have also led to [[wireless community network]]s widely deployed at numerous countries, both developing and developed ones. Rural wireless-ISP installations are typically not commercial in nature and are instead a patchwork of systems built up by hobbyists mounting antennas on [[radio masts and towers]], agricultural [[storage silo]]s, very tall trees, or whatever other tall objects are available.

Where radio spectrum regulation is not community-friendly, the channels are crowded or when equipment can not be afforded by local residents, [[Free-space optical communication#LEDs|free-space optical communication]] can also be deployed in a similar manner for point to point transmission in air (rather than in fiber optic cable).

====Packet radio====
{{Main article |Packet radio|AMPRNet}}

Packet radio connects computers or whole networks operated by radio amateurs with the option to access the Internet. Note that as per the regulatory rules outlined in the HAM license, Internet access and e-mail should be strictly related to the activities of hardware amateurs.

====Sneakernet====
{{Main article |Sneakernet}}

The term, a [[tongue-in-cheek]] play on ''net(work)'' as in ''[[Internet]]'' or ''[[Ethernet]]'', refers to the wearing of [[sneakers (footwear)|sneakers]] as the transport mechanism for the data.

For those who do not have access to or can not afford broadband at home, downloading large files and disseminating information is done by transmission through workplace or library networks, taken home and shared with neighbors by sneakernet.

There are various decentralized, [[Delay-tolerant networking|delay tolerant]] peer to peer applications which aim to fully automate this using any available interface, including both wireless (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi mesh, P2P or hotspots) and physically connected ones (USB storage, ethernet, etc.).

Sneakernets may also be used in tandem with computer network data transfer to increase data security or overall throughput for big data use cases. Innovation continues in the area to this day, for example AWS has recently announced Snowball, and bulk data processing is also done in a similar fashion by many research institutes and government agencies.

Internet access is limited by the relation between pricing and available resources to spend. Regarding the latter, it is estimated that 40% of the world's population has less than US$20 per year available to spend on [[information and communications technology]] (ICT).&lt;ref name="HilbertWD38,5"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.11.019 | volume=38 | title=When is Cheap, Cheap Enough to Bridge the Digital Divide?

From Latin America it is known that the borderline between ICT as a [[necessity good]] and ICT as a [[luxury good]] is roughly around the “magical number” of US$10 per person per month, or US$120 per year.&lt;ref name="HilbertWD38,5"/&gt; This is the amount of ICT spending people esteem to be a basic necessity. Current Internet access prices exceed the available resources by large in many countries.

Dial-up users pay the costs for making local or long distance phone calls, usually pay a monthly subscription fee, and may be subject to additional per minute or traffic based charges, and connect time limits by their ISP. Though less common today than in the past, some dial-up access is offered for "free" in return for watching banner ads as part of the dial-up service. [[NetZero]], [[Kmart#BlueLight internet service|BlueLight]], [[Juno Online Services|Juno]], [[Freenet (ISP)|Freenet (NZ)]], and [[Free-net]]s are examples of services providing free access. Some [[Wireless community network]]s continue the tradition of providing free Internet access.

Fixed broadband Internet access is often sold under an "unlimited" or [[flat rate]] pricing model, with price determined by the maximum data rate chosen by the customer, rather than a per minute or traffic based charge. Per minute and traffic based charges and traffic caps are common for mobile broadband Internet access.

Internet services like [[Facebook]], [[Wikipedia]] and [[Google]] have built special programs to partner with [[mobile network operator]]s (MNO) to introduce ''[[zero-rating]]'' the cost for their data volumes as a means to provide their service more broadly into developing markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/2014/feedback-review/zero-rating-development-darling-or-net-neutrality-nemesis |title=Zero-rating: Development Darling or Net Neutrality Nemesis? |accessdate=July 26, 2014 |last=McDiarmid |first=Andrew |publisher=Knight News Challenge |date=March 18, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808054736/https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/2014/feedback-review/zero-rating-development-darling-or-net-neutrality-nemesis |archivedate=August 8, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With increased consumer demand for streaming content such as video on demand and peer-to-peer file sharing, demand for bandwidth has increased rapidly and for some ISPs the flat rate pricing model may become unsustainable. However, with [[fixed costs]] estimated to represent 80–90% of the cost of providing broadband service, the marginal cost to carry additional traffic is low. Most ISPs do not disclose their costs, but the cost to transmit a gigabyte of data in 2011 was estimated to be about $0.03.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/gadgets-and-gear/hugh-thompson/what-is-a-fair-price-for-internet-service/article1890596/ "What is a fair price for Internet service?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209005530/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/gadgets-and-gear/hugh-thompson/what-is-a-fair-price-for-internet-service/article1890596/ |date=2012-02-09 }}, Hugh Thompson, ''Globe and Mail'' (Toronto), 1 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ISPs estimate that a small number of their users consume a disproportionate portion of the total bandwidth. In response some ISPs are considering, are experimenting with, or have implemented combinations of traffic based pricing, time of day or "peak" and "off peak" pricing, and bandwidth or traffic caps. Others claim that because the marginal cost of extra bandwidth is very small with 80 to 90 percent of the costs fixed regardless of usage level, that such steps are unnecessary or motivated by concerns other than the cost of delivering bandwidth to the end user.&lt;ref name=Hansell-2008&gt;{{cite news |first=Saul |last=Hansell |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/17/time-warner-download-too-much-and-you-might-pay-30-a-movie/?ref=technology |title=Time Warner: Download Too Much and You Might Pay $30 a Movie |publisher=The New York Times |date=January 17, 2008 |accessdate=June 6, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126061232/http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/17/time-warner-download-too-much-and-you-might-pay-30-a-movie/?ref=technology |archivedate=January 26, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comparebroadband.com.au/article_64_On--and-Off-Peak-Quotas.htm "On- and Off-Peak Quotas"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331205209/http://www.comparebroadband.com.au/article_64_On--and-Off-Peak-Quotas.htm |date=2012-03-31 }}, Compare Broadband, 12 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Leslie |last=Cauley |title=Comcast opens up about how it manages traffic |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Story?id=4692338&amp;page=1 |publisher=ABC News |date=April 20, 2008 |accessdate=June 6, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215205818/http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=4692338&amp;page=1 |archivedate=February 15, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bandwidth divide===

Traditionally the divide has been measured in terms of the existing numbers of subscriptions and digital devices ("have and have-not of subscriptions"). Recent studies have measured the digital divide not in terms of technological devices, but in terms of the existing bandwidth per individual (in kbit/s per capita).&lt;ref name="HilbertBitsDivide"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2jp4w5rq | doi=10.1016/j.telpol.2016.01.006 | volume=40 | title=The bad news is that the digital access divide is here to stay: Domestically installed bandwidths among 172 countries for 1986–2014 | year=2016 | journal=Telecommunications Policy | pages=567–581 | last1=Hilbert | first1=Martin | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604191331/http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2jp4w5rq | archivedate=2016-06-04 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HilbertInfoInequality"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1002/asi.23020 | volume=65 | title=Technological information inequality as an incessantly moving target: The redistribution of information and communication capacities between 1986 and 2010 | year=2013 | journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology | pages=821–835 | last1=Hilbert | first1=Martin | url=http://martinhilbert.net/TechInfoInequality.pdf | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027053254/http://www.martinhilbert.net/TechInfoInequality.pdf | archivedate=2016-10-27 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown in the Figure on the side, the digital divide in kbit/s is not monotonically decreasing, but re-opens up with each new innovation. For example, "the massive diffusion of narrow-band Internet and mobile phones during the late 1990s" increased digital inequality, as well as "the initial introduction of broadband DSL and cable modems during 2003–2004 increased levels of inequality".&lt;ref name="HilbertInfoInequality"/&gt; This is because a new kind of connectivity is never introduced instantaneously and uniformly to society as a whole at once, but diffuses slowly through social networks. As shown by the Figure, during the mid-2000s, communication capacity was more unequally distributed than during the late 1980s, when only fixed-line phones existed. The most recent increase in digital equality stems from the massive diffusion of the latest digital innovations (i.e. fixed and mobile broadband infrastructures, e.g. [[3G]] and fiber optics [[FTTH]]).&lt;ref&gt;SciDevNet (2014) How mobile phones increased the digital divide; {{cite web |url=http://www.scidev.net/global/data/scidev-net-at-large/how-mobile-phones-increased-the-digital-divide.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307214246/http://www.scidev.net/global/data/scidev-net-at-large/how-mobile-phones-increased-the-digital-divide.html |archivedate=2014-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown in the Figure, Internet access in terms of bandwidth is more unequally distributed in 2014 as it was in the mid-1990s.

=== In the United States ===
{{Main article|Internet in the United States}}

In the United States, billions of dollars have been invested in efforts to narrow the digital divide and bring Internet access to more people in low-income and rural areas of the United States. Internet availability varies widely state by state in the U.S. In 2011 for example, 87.1% of all [[New Hampshire]] residents lived in a household where Internet was available, ranking first in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Obama administration continued this commitment to narrowing the digital divide through the use of [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|stimulus funding]].&lt;ref name="McCollum-Spring2011" /&gt;  The [[National Center for Education Statistics]] reported that 98% of all U.S. classroom computers had Internet access in 2008 with roughly one computer with Internet access available for every three students. The percentage and ratio of students to computers was the same for rural schools (98% and 1 computer for every 2.9 students).&lt;ref&gt;[http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d10/tables/dt10_108.asp "Table 108: Number and internet access of instructional computers and rooms in public schools, by selected school characteristics: Selected years, 1995 through 2008"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506225447/http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d10/tables/dt10_108.asp |date=2012-05-06 }}, 2010 Tables and Figures, National Center for Education Statistics, U.S. Department of Education, August 2010, accessed 28 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rural access===
{{main article|Broadband universal service}}

One of the great challenges for Internet access in general and for broadband access in particular is to provide service to potential customers in areas of low [[population density]], such as to farmers, ranchers, and small towns. In cities where the population density is high, it is easier for a service provider to recover equipment costs, but each rural customer may require expensive equipment to get connected. While 66% of Americans had an Internet connection in 2010, that figure was only 50% in rural areas, according to the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Home-Broadband-2010/Part-1/Broadband-adoption-among-African-Americans-grew-significantly-between-2009-and-2010.aspx |title=Trends in broadband adoption |work=Home Broadband 2010 |first=Aaron |last=Scott |publisher=Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project |date=August 11, 2011 |accessdate=December 23, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219195728/http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Home-Broadband-2010/Part-1/Broadband-adoption-among-African-Americans-grew-significantly-between-2009-and-2010.aspx |archivedate=December 19, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Virgin Media]] advertised over 100 towns across the [[United Kingdom]] "from [[Cwmbran]] to [[Clydebank]]" that have access to their 100&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s service.&lt;ref name="100mb"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mediacentre.virginmedia.com/Stories/Virgin-Media-s-ultrafast-100Mb-broadband-now-available-to-over-four-million-UK-homes-211c.aspx |title= Virgin Media’s ultrafast 100Mb broadband now available to over four million UK homes |work= News release |publisher= Virgin Media |date= June 10, 2011 |accessdate= August 18, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120710052836/http://mediacentre.virginmedia.com/Stories/Virgin-Media-s-ultrafast-100Mb-broadband-now-available-to-over-four-million-UK-homes-211c.aspx |archivedate= July 10, 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wireless Internet service provider]]s (WISPs) are rapidly becoming a popular broadband option for rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news71497509.html Wireless World: Wi-Fi now in rural areas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916103841/http://www.physorg.com/news71497509.html |date=2011-09-16 }} July 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The technology's line-of-sight requirements may hamper connectivity in some areas with hilly and heavily foliated terrain. However, the Tegola project, a successful pilot in remote Scotland, demonstrates that wireless can be a viable option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tegola.org.uk | title=Tegola project linking Skye, Knoydart and Loch Hourne | accessdate=2010-03-16 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015180711/http://www.tegola.org.uk/ | archivedate=2012-10-15 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Broadband for Rural Nova Scotia initiative]] is the first program in North America to guarantee access to "100% of civic addresses" in a region. It is based on [[Motorola Canopy]] technology. As of November 2011, under 1000 households have reported access problems. Deployment of a new cell network by one Canopy provider ([[EastLink (company)|Eastlink]]) was expected to provide the alternative of 3G/4G service, possibly at a special unmetered rate, for areas harder to serve by Canopy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.ns.ca/econ/broadband/ "Broadband for Rural Nova Scotia"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519220248/http://www.gov.ns.ca/econ/broadband/ |date=2012-05-19 }}, Economic and Rural Development, Nova Scotia, Canada, access 27 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Zealand, a fund has been formed by the government to improve rural broadband,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rural Broadband Initiative 2|url=http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/technology-communications/fast-broadband/new-initiatives/rbi2-mbsf-policy-settings|accessdate=30 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424200803/http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/technology-communications/fast-broadband/new-initiatives/rbi2-mbsf-policy-settings/|archivedate=24 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mobile phone coverage. Current proposals include: (a) extending fibre coverage and upgrading copper to support VDSL, (b) focussing on improving the coverage of cellphone technology, or (c) regional wireless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rural broadband extension bids: Your guide to the RBI2 runners and riders|url=https://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?contentid=21425|accessdate=30 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417110115/https://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?contentid=21425|archivedate=17 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several countries have started to [[Hybrid Access Networks]] to provide faster Internet services in rural areas by enabling network operators to efficiently combine their [[XDSL]] and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] networks.

===Access as a civil or human right===
{{Further information |Digital rights|Right to Internet access}}

The actions, statements, opinions, and recommendations outlined below have led to the suggestion that Internet access itself is or should become a civil or perhaps a human right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.du.edu/gsis/hrhw/volumes/2004/best-2004.pdf "Can the Internet be a Human Right?"], Michael L.

Several countries have adopted laws requiring the state to work to ensure that Internet access is broadly available and/or preventing the state from unreasonably restricting an individual's access to information and the Internet:
* [[Costa Rica]]: A 30 July 2010 ruling by the Supreme Court of Costa Rica stated: "Without fear of equivocation, it can be said that these technologies [information technology and communication] have impacted the way humans communicate, facilitating the connection between people and institutions worldwide and eliminating barriers of space and time. At this time, access to these technologies becomes a basic tool to facilitate the exercise of fundamental rights and democratic participation (e-democracy) and citizen control, education, freedom of thought and expression, access to information and public services online, the right to communicate with government electronically and administrative transparency, among others. This includes the fundamental right of access to these technologies, in particular, the right of access to the Internet or World Wide Web."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20151217120514/http://200.91.68.20/pj/scij/busqueda/jurisprudencia/jur_texto_sentencia.asp?nValor2=483874&amp;tem1=013141&amp;param7=0&amp;lResultado=3&amp;nValor1=1&amp;strTipM=T&amp;strLib=LIB "Judgement 12790 of the Supreme Court"], File 09-013141-0007-CO, 30 July 2010.

:1. We, the representatives of the peoples of the world, assembled in Geneva from 10–12 December 2003 for the first phase of the World Summit on the Information Society, declare our common desire and commitment to build a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society, where everyone can create, access, utilize and share information and knowledge, enabling individuals, communities and peoples to achieve their full potential in promoting their sustainable development and improving their quality of life, premised on the purposes and principles of the [[Charter of the United Nations]] and respecting fully and upholding the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

:3. We reaffirm the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelation of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the [[right to development]], as enshrined in the [[Vienna Declaration]]. We also reaffirm that [[democracy]], [[sustainable development]], and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as good governance at all levels are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. We further resolve to strengthen the rule of law in international as in national affairs.

The [[World Summit on the Information Society|WSIS]] Declaration of Principles makes specific reference to the importance of the right to [[freedom of expression]] in the "[[information society|Information Society]]" in stating:
:4. We reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the [[information society|Information Society]], and as outlined in Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], that everyone has the right to [[Freedom of speech|freedom of opinion and expression]]; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need and the foundation of all social organisation. It is central to the Information Society. Everyone, everywhere should have the opportunity to participate and no one should be excluded from the benefits of the Information Society offers."&lt;ref name="Murray"/&gt;

The 88 recommendations made by the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression in a May 2011 report to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]] of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] include several that bear on the question of the right to Internet access:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.27_en.pdf "VI. Conclusions and recommendations"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402152208/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.27_en.pdf |date=2012-04-02 }}, ''Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Frank La Rue'', Human Rights Council, Seventeenth session
Agenda item 3, United Nations General Assembly, 16 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
:67. Unlike any other medium, the Internet enables individuals to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds instantaneously and inexpensively across national borders. By vastly expanding the capacity of individuals to enjoy their right to freedom of opinion and expression, which is an “enabler” of other human rights, the Internet boosts economic, social and political development, and contributes to the progress of humankind as a whole. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur encourages other Special Procedures mandate holders to engage on the issue of the Internet with respect to their particular mandates.

:78. While blocking and filtering measures deny users access to specific content on the Internet, States have also taken measures to cut off access to the Internet entirely. The Special Rapporteur considers cutting off users from Internet access, regardless of the justification provided, including on the grounds of violating intellectual property rights law, to be disproportionate and thus a violation of article 19, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

:79. The Special Rapporteur calls upon all States to ensure that Internet access is maintained at all times, including during times of political unrest.

:85. Given that the Internet has become an indispensable tool for realizing a range of human rights, combating inequality, and accelerating development and human progress, ensuring universal access to the Internet should be a priority for all States. Each State should thus develop a concrete and effective policy, in consultation with individuals from all sections of society, including the private sector and relevant Government ministries, to make the Internet widely available, accessible and affordable to all segments of population.

==Natural disasters and access==

Natural disasters disrupt internet access in profound ways. This is important—not only for telecommunication companies who own the networks and the businesses who use them, but for emergency crew and displaced citizens as well. The situation is worsened when hospitals or other buildings necessary to disaster response lose their connection. Knowledge gained from studying past internet disruptions by natural disasters could be put to use in planning or recovery. Additionally, because of both natural and man-made disasters, studies in network resiliency are now being conducted to prevent large-scale outages.&lt;ref name="omer"&gt;[http://www.stevens-tech.edu/csr/fileadmin/csr/Publications/Omer_Measuring_the_Resilience_of_the_Global_Internet__Infrastructure.pdf Measuring the Resilience of the Global Internet Infrastructure System]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 2009 3rd Annual IEEE Systems Conference, 156–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

One way natural disasters impact internet connection is by damaging end sub-networks (subnets), making them unreachable. A study on local networks after [[Hurricane Katrina]] found that 26% of subnets within the storm coverage were unreachable.&lt;ref name="Erjongmanee"&gt;[http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~jic/katrina.pdf Inference of Network-Service Disruption upon Natural Disasters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523173124/http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~jic/katrina.pdf |date=2013-05-23 }}, accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; At Hurricane Katrina’s peak intensity, almost 35% of networks in Mississippi were without power, while around 14% of Louisiana’s networks were disrupted.&lt;ref name="Katrina"&gt;[http://www.renesys.com/tech/presentations/pdf/Renesys-Katrina-Report-9sep2005.pdf Impact of Hurricane Katrina on Internet Infrastructure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115094240/http://www.renesys.com/tech/presentations/pdf/Renesys-Katrina-Report-9sep2005.pdf |date=2012-11-15 }}, Renesys Report, 9 September 2005, accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Of those unreachable subnets, 73% were disrupted for four weeks or longer and 57% were at “network edges where important emergency organizations such as hospitals and government agencies are mostly located”.&lt;ref name="Erjongmanee" /&gt; Extensive infrastructure damage and inaccessible areas were two explanations for the long delay in returning service.&lt;ref name="Erjongmanee" /&gt; The company Cisco has revealed a Network Emergency Response Vehicle (NERV), a truck that makes portable communications possible for emergency responders despite traditional networks being disrupted.&lt;ref name="NERV"&gt;[http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/business&amp;id=8867345 Cisco trucks help restore internet after disasters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303132941/http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news%2Fbusiness&amp;id=8867345 |date=2013-03-03 }}, ABC News report, 30 October 2012, accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second way natural disasters destroy internet connectivity is by severing submarine cables—fiber-optic cables placed on the ocean floor that provide international internet connection. A [[2006 Hengchun earthquakes|sequence of undersea earthquakes]] cut six out of seven international cables connected to that country and caused a tsunami that wiped out one of its cable and landing stations.&lt;ref name="telkom"&gt;[http://www.telkom.co.id/media-corner/press-release/taiwan-s-earthquake-and-tsunami-caused-internet-access-s-interference.html Taiwan’s Earthquake and Tsunami Caused Internet access’s Interference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605104155/http://www.telkom.co.id/media-corner/press-release/taiwan-s-earthquake-and-tsunami-caused-internet-access-s-interference.html |date=2013-06-05 }}, Telkom Indonesia Press Release, 27 December 2006, accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HKUST"&gt;[http://www.ust.hk/itsc/channel/2007feb/earthquake.html Impact of Taiwan Earthquake on Internet Access] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228000932/http://www.ust.hk/itsc/channel/2007feb/earthquake.html |date=2008-12-28 }}, Choy, C.

With the rise in popularity of [[cloud computing]], concern has grown over access to cloud-hosted data in the event of a natural disaster. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been in the news for major network outages in April 2011 and June 2012.&lt;ref name="AWS2011"&gt;[http://aws.amazon.com/message/65648/ Summary of the Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS Service Disruption in the US East Region] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907143711/https://aws.amazon.com/message/65648/ |date=2013-09-07 }}, AWS message, 29 April 2011, accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AWS2012"&gt;[https://aws.amazon.com/message/67457/ Summary of the AWS Service Event in the US East Region] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724051708/http://aws.amazon.com/message/67457/ |date=2013-07-24 }}, AWS message, 2 July 2012, accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; AWS, like other major cloud hosting companies, prepares for typical outages and large-scale natural disasters with backup power as well as backup data centers in other locations. AWS divides the globe into five regions and then splits each region into availability zones. A data center in one availability zone should be backed up by a data center in a different availability zone. Theoretically, a natural disaster would not affect more than one availability zone.&lt;ref name="justinsb"&gt;[http://justinsb.posterous.com/aws-down-why-the-sky-is-falling AWS is down: Why the sky is falling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121223213308/http://justinsb.posterous.com/aws-down-why-the-sky-is-falling |date=2012-12-23 }}, justinsb's posterous, 21 April 2011, accessed 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory plays out as long as human error is not added to the mix.

[[File:Teenage Engineering Pocket Operators - PO-14 sub &amp; stock cartons - 2015 NAMM Show.jpg|thumb|Electronics inventory]]
'''Inventory''' ([[American English]]) or '''stock''' ([[British English]]) is the goods and materials that a [[business]] holds for the ultimate goal of resale (or repair).{{refn|group=nb|The word ''inventory'' is commonly used in [[American English]] and in business accounting. In the rest of the English-speaking world, ''stock'' is more commonly used, although ''inventory'' is recognised as a synonym.}}

[[Stock management|Inventory management]] is a discipline primarily about specifying the shape and placement of stocked goods. It is required at different locations within a facility or within many locations of a supply network to precede the regular and planned course of production and stock of materials.

The concept of inventory, stock or work-in-process has been extended from manufacturing systems to service businesses&lt;ref&gt;"Production and Operations Management: Manufacturing and Services", R.B. Chase, N.J. Aquiline and F.R. Jacobs, Eighth Edition, 1998, pp 582-583
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Operations and Supply Chain Management: The Core", Third Edition, F. Robert Jacobs and Richard B. Chase, p 346&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maynard's Industrial Engineering Handbook, Fifth Edition, Kjell B. Landin (ed.), McGraw-Hill 2001, p G.8&lt;/ref&gt; and projects,&lt;ref&gt;"Factory Physics for Managers", E.S. Pound, J.H. Bell, and M.L. Spearman, McGraw-Hill 2014, p 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"New Era of Project Delivery – Project as Production System", R.G. Shiny and T.R. Zabelle, Journal of Project Production Management, Vol 1, pp Nov 2016, pp 13–24, [https://www.researchgate.net/publications/312602707_&amp;nbsp;New_Era_of_Project_Delivery_-_Project_as_Production_System https://www.researchgate.net/publications/312602707]
&lt;/ref&gt; by generalizing the definition to be "all work within the process of production- all work that is or has occurred prior to the completion of production." In the context of a manufacturing production system, inventory refers to all work that has occurred – raw materials, partially finished products, finished products prior to sale and departure from the manufacturing system. In the context of services, inventory refers to all work done prior to sale, including partially process information.

Definition

The scope of inventory management concerns the balance between replenishment lead time, carrying costs of inventory, asset management, inventory forecasting, inventory valuation, inventory visibility, future inventory price forecasting, physical inventory, available physical space, quality management, replenishment, returns and defective goods, and demand forecasting. Balancing these competing requirements leads to optimal inventory levels, which is an ongoing process as the business needs shift and react to the wider environment.

Inventory management involves a retailer seeking to acquire and maintain a proper merchandise assortment while ordering, shipping, handling and related costs are kept in check. It also involves systems and processes that identify inventory requirements, set targets, provide replenishment techniques, report actual and projected inventory status and handle all functions related to the tracking and management of material. This would include the monitoring of material moved into and out of stockroom locations and the reconciling of the inventory balances. It also may include [[ABC analysis]], lot tracking, cycle counting support, etc. Management of the inventories, with the primary objective of determining/controlling stock levels within the physical distribution system, functions to balance the need for product availability against the need for minimizing stock holding and handling costs.

==Business inventory==

=== Reasons for keeping stock===
There are five basic reasons for keeping an inventory
#Time – The time lags present in the supply chain, from supplier to user at every stage, requires that you maintain certain amounts of inventory to use in this [[lead time]]. However, in practice, inventory is to be maintained for consumption during 'variations in lead time'. Lead time itself can be addressed by ordering that many days in advance.
#[[Seasonality|Seasonal Demand]]: demands varies periodically, but producers capacity is fixed. This can lead to stock accumulation, consider for example how goods consumed only in holidays can lead to accumulation of large stocks on the anticipation of future consumption. 
#Uncertainty – Inventories are maintained as buffers to meet uncertainties in demand, supply and movements of goods.
#[[Economies of scale]] – Ideal condition of "one unit at a time at a place where a user needs it, when he needs it" principle tends to incur lots of costs in terms of logistics. So bulk buying, movement and storing brings in economies of scale, thus inventory.
# Appreciation in Value – In some situations, some stock gains the required value when it is kept for some time to allow it reach the desired standard for consumption, or for production. For example; beer in the brewing industry

All these stock reasons can apply to any owner or product.

=== Special terms used in dealing with inventory management ===
* ''[[Stock Keeping Unit]]'' (SKU) SKUs are clear, internal identification numbers assigned to each of the products and their variants. SKUs can be any combination of letters and numbers chosen, just as long as the system is consistent and used for all the products in the inventory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SKUs and UPCs: do your products have a unique identity?|url = https://www.tradegecko.com/blog/skus-and-upcs-do-your-products-have-an-identity|website = www.tradegecko.com|accessdate = 2015-11-23|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151123213941/https://www.tradegecko.com/blog/skus-and-upcs-do-your-products-have-an-identity|archivedate = 2015-11-23|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Stockout'' means running out of the inventory of an SKU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialinvestor.com/terms/1072.html|title=Specialinvestor.com|author=|date=|website=www.specialinvestor.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231032227/http://www.specialinvestor.com/terms/1072.html|archivedate=31 December 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[New old stock]]" (sometimes abbreviated NOS) is a term used in business to refer to merchandise being offered for sale that was manufactured long ago but that has never been used. Such merchandise may not be produced anymore, and the new old stock may represent the only market source of a particular item at the present time.

===Typology===
#Buffer/[[safety stock]]
#[[Reorder level]] 
#Cycle stock (Used in batch processes, it is the available inventory, excluding buffer stock)
#De-coupling (Buffer stock held between the machines in a single process which serves as a buffer for the next one allowing smooth flow of work instead of waiting the previous or next machine in the same process)
#Anticipation stock (Building up extra stock for periods of increased demand – e.g. ice cream for summer)
#Pipeline stock (Goods still in transit or in the process of distribution – have left the factory but not arrived at the customer yet)

Average Daily/Weekly usage quantity X Lead time in days + Safety stock

===Inventory examples===
While [[accountant]]s often discuss inventory in terms of goods for sale, organizations –  [[manufacturer]]s, [[service provider|service-provider]]s and [[not-for-profit]]s – also have inventories (fixtures, furniture, supplies, etc.) that they do not intend to sell. Manufacturers', [[distribution (business)|distributor]]s', and wholesalers' inventory tends to cluster in [[warehouse]]s. [[Retailer]]s' inventory may exist in a warehouse or in a [[Retailing#Shops and stores|shop]] or store accessible to [[customers]]. Inventories not intended for sale to customers or to [[consumer|client]]s may be held in any premises an organization uses.  Stock ties up cash and, if uncontrolled, it will be impossible to know the actual level of stocks and therefore impossible to control them.

While the reasons for holding stock were covered earlier, most manufacturing organizations usually divide their "goods for sale" inventory into:
* [[Raw materials]] – materials and components scheduled for use in making a product.
* [[Work in process]], WIP – materials and components that have begun their transformation to finished goods.
* [[Finished goods]] – goods ready for sale to customers.
* Goods for resale – returned goods that are salable.
* Stocks in transit.
* Consignment stocks.
* Maintenance supply.

For example:

====Manufacturing====
A canned food manufacturer's materials inventory includes the ingredients to form the foods to be canned, empty cans and their lids (or coils of steel or aluminum for constructing those components), labels, and anything else (solder, glue, etc.) that will form part of a finished can. The firm's work in process includes those materials from the time of release to the work floor until they become complete and ready for sale to wholesale or retail customers. This may be vats of prepared food, filled cans not yet labeled or sub-assemblies of food components. It may also include finished cans that are not yet packaged into cartons or pallets. Its finished good inventory consists of all the filled and labeled cans of food in its warehouse that it has manufactured and wishes to sell to food distributors (wholesalers), to grocery stores (retailers), and even perhaps to consumers through arrangements like [[factory outlet|factory store]]s and outlet centers.

==== Capital projects ====
The partially completed work (or work in process) is a measure of inventory built during the work execution of a capital project,&lt;ref&gt;“Construction: one type of Project Production System”, Proceedings of ''13th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction.'' Sydney, Australia, 19–21 Jul 2005. pp 29–35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Strategic Positioning of Inventory to match demand in a capital projects supply chain”, K. D. Walsh, J. C. Hershauer, I.D. Tommelein and T. A. Walsh, Journal of Construction Engineerign and Manabement, Nov–Dec 2014, p 818&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“New Era of Project Delivery – Project as Production System”, R. G. Shenoy and T. R. Zabelle, Journal of Project Production Management, Vol 1,  pp Nov 2016, pp 13–24

&lt;/ref&gt; such as encountered in civilian infrastructure construction or oil and gas. Inventory may not only reflect physical items (such as materials, parts, partially-finished sub-assemblies) but also knowledge work-in-process (such as partially completed engineering designs of components and assemblies to be fabricated).

====Virtual inventory====
A "virtual inventory" (also known as a "bank inventory") enables a group of users to share common parts, especially where their availability at short notice may be critical but they are unlikely to required by more than a few bank members at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;''Inventory and Logistics Operations'', CIPS Study Materials, Profex Publishing, 2012, page 54&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual inventory also allows distributors and fulfilment houses to ship goods to retailers direct from stock regardless of whether the stock is held in a retail store, stock room or warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;PLS Logistics,[http://info.plslogistics.com/blog/more-inventory-less-warehouse-space-how-virtual-inventory-works More Inventory, Less Warehouse Space: How Virtual Inventory Works] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208123430/http://info.plslogistics.com/blog/more-inventory-less-warehouse-space-how-virtual-inventory-works |date=2018-02-08 }}, published 22 March 2016  accessed 7 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costs associated with inventory===
There are several costs associated with inventory:
* [[Ordering cost]]
* [[Setup cost]]
* [[Holding Cost]]
* [[Shortage Cost]]

==Principle of inventory proportionality==

===Purpose===
Inventory proportionality is the goal of demand-driven inventory management. The primary optimal outcome is to have the same number of days' (or hours', etc.) worth of inventory on hand across all products so that the time of runout of all products would be simultaneous. In such a case, there is no "excess inventory," that is, inventory that would be left over of another product when the first product runs out. Excess inventory is sub-optimal because the money spent to obtain it could have been utilized better elsewhere, i.e. to the product that just ran out.

The secondary goal of inventory proportionality is inventory minimization. By integrating accurate [[demand forecasting]] with inventory management, rather than only looking at past averages, a much more accurate and optimal outcome is expected.

Integrating demand forecasting into inventory management in this way also allows for the prediction of the "can fit" point when inventory storage is limited on a per-product basis.

===Applications===
The technique of inventory proportionality is most appropriate for inventories that remain unseen by the consumer, as opposed to "keep full" systems where a retail consumer would like to see full shelves of the product they are buying so as not to think they are buying something old, unwanted or stale; and differentiated from the "trigger point" systems where product is reordered when it hits a certain level; inventory proportionality is used effectively by just-in-time manufacturing processes and retail applications where the product is hidden from view.

One early example of inventory proportionality used in a retail application in the United States was for motor fuel. Motor fuel (e.g. gasoline) is generally stored in underground storage tanks. The motorists do not know whether they are buying gasoline off the top or bottom of the tank, nor need they care. Additionally, these storage tanks have a maximum capacity and cannot be overfilled. Finally, the product is expensive. Inventory proportionality is used to balance the inventories of the different grades of motor fuel, each stored in dedicated tanks, in proportion to the sales of each grade. Excess inventory is not seen or valued by the consumer, so it is simply cash sunk (literally) into the ground. Inventory proportionality minimizes the amount of excess inventory carried in underground storage tanks. This application for motor fuel was first developed and implemented by [[Petrolsoft Corporation]] in 1990 for [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] Products Company. Most major oil companies use such systems today.&lt;ref name=aspentech&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.aspentech.com/solutions/industry_solutions/refining_marketing/aspenone_supply_distribution.cfm|title=aspenONE Supply &amp; Distribution for Refining &amp; Marketing|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608125910/http://www.aspentech.com/solutions/industry_solutions/refining_marketing/aspenone_supply_distribution.cfm|archivedate=2010-06-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roots===
The use of inventory proportionality in the United States is thought to have been inspired by Japanese [[just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]] parts inventory management made famous by [[Toyota]] Motors in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bsu.edu/web/scfrazier2/jit/mainpage.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425054824/http://www.bsu.edu/web/scfrazier2/jit/mainpage.htm |archivedate=2010-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==High-level inventory management==
It seems that around 1880&lt;ref&gt;Relevance Lost, Johnson and Kaplan, Harvard Business School Press, 1987, p126&lt;/ref&gt; there was a change in manufacturing practice from companies with relatively homogeneous lines of products to horizontally integrated companies with unprecedented diversity in processes and products. Those companies (especially in metalworking) attempted to achieve success through economies of scope - the gains of jointly producing two or more products in one facility. The managers now needed information on the effect of product-mix decisions on overall profits and therefore needed accurate product-cost information. A variety of attempts to achieve this were unsuccessful due to the huge overhead of the information processing of the time. However, the burgeoning need for financial reporting after 1900 created unavoidable pressure for [[financial accounting]] of stock and the management need to cost manage products became overshadowed. In particular, it was the need for audited accounts that sealed the fate of managerial cost accounting. The dominance of financial reporting accounting over [[management accounting]] remains to this day with few exceptions, and the financial reporting definitions of 'cost' have distorted effective management 'cost' accounting since that time. This is particularly true of inventory.

Hence, high-level financial inventory has these two basic formulas, which relate to the accounting period:

#Cost of [[Beginning Inventory]] at the start of the period + inventory [[purchase]]s within the period + cost of [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]] within the period =  cost of goods available
# Cost of goods available − cost of [[ending inventory]] at the end of the period = [[cost of goods sold]]

The benefit of these formulas is that the first absorbs all overheads of production and raw material costs into a value of inventory for reporting. The second formula then creates the new start point for the next period and gives a figure to be subtracted from the sales price to determine some form of sales-margin figure.

Manufacturing management is more interested in ''inventory turnover ratio'' or ''average days to sell inventory'' since it tells them something about relative inventory levels.

:Inventory turnover ratio (also known as [[inventory turns]]) = cost of goods sold / Average Inventory = Cost of Goods Sold / ((Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2)

and its inverse

:Average Days to Sell Inventory = Number of Days a Year / Inventory Turnover Ratio = 365 days a year / Inventory Turnover Ratio

This ratio estimates how many times the inventory turns over a year. This number tells how much cash/goods are tied up waiting for the process and is a critical measure of process reliability and effectiveness. So a factory with two inventory turns has six months stock on hand, which is generally not a good figure (depending upon the industry), whereas a factory that moves from six turns to twelve turns has probably improved effectiveness by 100%. This improvement will have some negative results in the financial reporting, since the 'value' now stored in the factory as inventory is reduced.

While these accounting measures of inventory are very useful because of their simplicity, they are also fraught with the danger of their own assumptions. There are, in fact, so many things that can vary hidden under this appearance of simplicity that a variety of 'adjusting' assumptions may be used. These include:
* [[Specific Identification]]
* [[Lower of cost or market]]
* [[Weighted Average Cost]]
* [[Moving-Average Cost]]
* [[FIFO and LIFO accounting|FIFO and LIFO]].
* [[Queueing theory]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278612510000397|title=A queueing approach to production-inventory planning for supply chain with uncertain demands: Case study of PAKSHOO Chemicals Company|author=Fathi, M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Inventory Turn is a financial accounting tool for evaluating inventory and it is not necessarily a management tool. Inventory management should be forward looking. The methodology applied is based on historical cost of goods sold. The ratio may not be able to reflect the usability of future production demand, as well as customer demand.

Business models, including Just in Time (JIT) Inventory, Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) and Customer Managed Inventory (CMI), attempt to minimize on-hand inventory and increase inventory turns. VMI and CMI have gained considerable attention due to the success of third-party vendors who offer added expertise and knowledge that organizations may not possess.

Inventory management in modern days is online oriented and more viable in digital. This type of dynamics order management will require end-to-end visibility, collaboration across fulfillment processes, real-time data automation among different companies, and integration among multiple systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://magentone.over-blog.com/2017/03/big-trends-for-inventory-management-in-2017.html|title=Big trends for Inventory Management in 2017 [Infographic] (UPDATED) - Magentone Developers Website|work=Magentone Developers Website|access-date=2017-07-19|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170718182930/http://magentone.over-blog.com/2017/03/big-trends-for-inventory-management-in-2017.html|archivedate=2017-07-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accounting for inventory==
{{Accounting}}

Each country has its own rules about [[accounting]] for inventory that fit with their financial-reporting rules.

For example, organizations in the U.S. define '''inventory''' to suit their needs within [[US generally accepted accounting principles|US Generally Accepted Accounting Practices]] (GAAP), the rules defined by the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB) (and others) and enforced by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and other federal and state agencies. Other countries often have similar arrangements but with their own accounting standards and national agencies instead.

It is intentional that [[financial accounting]] uses standards that allow the public to compare firms' performance, [[cost accounting]] functions internally to an organization and potentially with much greater flexibility. A discussion of inventory from standard and [[Theory of Constraints]]-based ([[throughput]]) [[cost accounting]] perspective follows some examples and a discussion of inventory from a [[financial accounting]] perspective.

The internal costing/valuation of inventory can be complex. Whereas in the past most enterprises ran simple, one-process factories, such enterprises are quite probably in the minority in the 21st century. Where 'one process' factories exist, there is a market for the goods created, which establishes an independent market value for the good. Today, with multistage-process companies, there is much inventory that would once have been finished goods which is now held as 'work in process' (WIP). This needs to be valued in the accounts, but the valuation is a management decision since there is no market for the partially finished product. This somewhat arbitrary 'valuation' of WIP combined with the allocation of overheads to it has led to some unintended and undesirable results.

===Financial accounting===
An organization's inventory can appear a mixed blessing, since it counts as an [[asset]] on the [[balance sheet]], but it also ties up money that could serve for other purposes and requires additional expense for its protection. Inventory may also cause significant tax expenses, depending on particular countries' laws regarding depreciation of inventory, as in [[Thor Power Tool Company v. Commissioner]].

Inventory appears as a [[current asset]] on an organization's balance sheet because the organization can, in principle, turn it into cash by selling it. Some organizations hold larger inventories than their operations require in order to inflate their apparent asset value and their perceived profitability.

In addition to the money tied up by acquiring inventory, inventory also brings associated costs for warehouse space, for utilities, and for [[insurance]] to cover staff to handle and protect it from fire and other disasters, obsolescence, shrinkage (theft and errors), and others. Such [[holding cost]]s can mount up: between a third and a half of its acquisition value per year. &lt;!-- An organization that reduced its inventory by $1,000,000 would add that amount to its net income [huh???  Its net income would only increase by the income received minus the cost of the goods sold], an attractive prospect that helps to explain the popularity of programs like [[Just in time]] (JIT) inventory.   --&gt;

Businesses that stock too little inventory cannot take advantage of large orders from customers if they cannot deliver. The conflicting objectives of cost control and customer service often put an organization's financial and operating managers against its [[sales]] and [[marketing]] departments. Salespeople, in particular, often receive sales-commission payments, so unavailable goods may reduce their potential personal income. This conflict can be minimised by reducing production time to being near or less than customers' expected delivery time. This effort, known as "[[Lean production]]" will significantly reduce [[working capital]] tied up in inventory and reduce manufacturing costs (See the [[Toyota Production System]]).

===Role of inventory accounting===
By helping the organization to make better decisions, the accountants can help the public sector to change in a very positive way that delivers increased value for the taxpayer’s investment. It can also help to incentive's progress and to ensure that reforms are sustainable and effective in the long term, by ensuring that success is appropriately recognized in both the formal and informal reward systems of the organization.

To say that they have a key role to play is an understatement. Finance is connected to most, if not all, of the key business processes within the organization. It should be steering the stewardship and accountability systems that ensure that the organization is conducting its business in an appropriate, ethical manner. It is critical that these foundations are firmly laid. So often they are the litmus test by which public confidence in the institution is either won or lost.

Finance should also be providing the information, analysis and advice to enable the organizations’ service managers to operate effectively. This goes beyond the traditional preoccupation with budgets – how much have we spent so far, how much do we have left to spend? It is about helping the organization to better understand its own performance. That means making the connections and understanding the relationships between given inputs – the resources brought to bear – and the outputs and outcomes that they achieve. It is also about understanding and actively managing risks within the organization and its activities.

===FIFO vs. LIFO accounting===
{{main article|FIFO and LIFO accounting}}

When a merchant buys goods from inventory, the value of the inventory account is reduced by the [[cost of goods sold]] (COGS). This is simple where the cost has not varied across those held in stock; but where it has, then an agreed method must be derived to evaluate it. For [[commodity]] items that one cannot track individually, accountants must choose a method that fits the nature of the sale. Two popular methods in use are: FIFO (first in – first out) and LIFO (last in – first out).

FIFO treats the first unit that arrived in inventory as the first one sold. LIFO considers the last unit arriving in inventory as the first one sold. Which method an accountant selects can have a significant effect on net income and [[book value]] and, in turn, on taxation. Using LIFO accounting for inventory, a company generally reports lower net income and lower book value, due to the effects of inflation. This generally results in lower taxation. Due to LIFO's potential to skew inventory value, [[UK GAAP]] and [[International Accounting Standards|IAS]] have effectively banned LIFO inventory accounting. LIFO accounting is permitted in the United States subject to section 472 of the [[Internal Revenue Code]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title26/pdf/USCODE-2011-title26-subtitleA-chap1-subchapE-partII-subpartD-sec472.pdf Internal Revenue Code, § 472: Last-in, first-out inventories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223134628/https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title26/pdf/USCODE-2011-title26-subtitleA-chap1-subchapE-partII-subpartD-sec472.pdf |date=2016-12-23 }}, accessed 23 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard cost accounting===
{{main article|Standard cost accounting}}
Standard cost accounting uses [[ratio]]s called [[Efficiency (economics)|efficiencies]] that compare the labour and materials actually used to produce a good with those that the same goods would have required under "standard" conditions. As long as actual and standard conditions are similar, few problems arise. Unfortunately, standard cost accounting methods developed about 100 years ago, when labor comprised the most important cost in manufactured goods. Standard methods continue to emphasize labor efficiency even though that resource now constitutes a (very) small part of cost in most cases.

Standard cost accounting can hurt managers, workers, and firms in several ways. For example, a policy decision to increase inventory can harm a manufacturing manager's [[performance evaluation]]. Increasing inventory requires increased production, which means that processes must operate at higher rates. When (not if) something goes wrong, the process takes longer and uses more than the standard labor time. The manager appears responsible for the excess, even though s/he has no control over the production requirement or the problem.

In adverse economic times, firms use the same efficiencies to downsize, rightsize, or otherwise reduce their labor force. Workers laid off under those circumstances have even less control over excess inventory and cost efficiencies than their managers.

Many financial and cost accountants have agreed for many years on the desirability of replacing standard cost accounting. They have not, however, found a successor.

===Theory of constraints cost accounting===
[[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] developed the [[Theory of Constraints]] in part to address the cost-accounting problems in what he calls the "cost world." He offers a substitute, called [[throughput accounting]], that uses [[Throughput (business)|throughput]] (money for goods sold to customers) in place of output (goods produced that may sell or may boost inventory) and considers labor as a fixed rather than as a variable cost. He defines inventory simply as everything the organization owns that it plans to sell, including buildings, machinery, and many other things in addition to the categories listed here. Throughput accounting recognizes only one class of variable costs: the truly variable costs, like materials and components, which vary directly with the quantity produced

Finished goods inventories remain [[balance sheet|balance-sheet]] assets, but labor-efficiency ratios no longer evaluate managers and workers. Instead of an incentive to reduce labor cost, throughput accounting focuses attention on the relationships between throughput (revenue or income) on one hand and controllable operating expenses and changes in inventory on the other.

==National accounts==
Inventories also play an important role in [[national accounts]] and the analysis of the [[business cycle]]. Some short-term [[macroeconomic]] fluctuations are attributed to the [[Inventory investment#Inventory investment over the business cycle|inventory cycle]].

==Distressed inventory==
Also known as distressed or expired stock, distressed inventory is inventory whose potential to be sold at a normal [[cost]] has passed or will soon pass. In certain industries it could also mean that the stock is or will soon be impossible to sell. Examples of distressed inventory include products which have reached their [[Shelf life|expiry date]], or have reached a date in advance of expiry at which the planned market will no longer purchase them (e.g. 3 months left to expiry), clothing which is out of [[fashion]], music which is no longer popular and old newspapers or magazines. It also includes computer or consumer-electronic equipment which is obsolete or discontinued and whose manufacturer is unable to support it, along with products which use that type of equipment e.g. [[VHS]] format equipment and videos.&lt;ref name="SAXENA2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=R. S. SAXENA|title=INVENTORY MANAGEMENT: Controlling in a Fluctuating Demand Environment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H6AM-vRhmoAC&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=7 April 2012|date=1 December 2009|publisher=Global India Publications|isbn=978-93-8022-821-1|pages=24–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[Cisco]] wrote off inventory worth US $2.25 billion due to duplicate orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Armony |first=Mor
 |title=The Impact of Duplicate Orders on Demand Estimation and Capacity Investment |url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0371}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is considered one of the biggest inventory write-offs in business history.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Stock rotation==

Stock rotation is the practice of changing the way inventory is displayed on a regular basis. This is most commonly used in hospitality and retail - particularity where food products are sold. For example, in the case of supermarkets that a customer frequents on a regular basis, the customer may know exactly what they want and where it is. This results in many customers going straight to the product they seek and do not look at other items on sale. To discourage this practice, stores will rotate the location of stock to encourage customers to look through the entire store. This is in hopes the customer will pick up items they would not normally see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Perlitz|title=Retail Services|year=2012|publisher=McGraw HIll|location=Australia|isbn=9781743070741|pages=440|url=http://www.mcgraw-hill.com.au/html/9781743070741.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221050022/http://www.mcgraw-hill.com.au/html/9781743070741.html|archivedate=2013-02-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inventory credit==
Inventory credit refers to the use of stock, or inventory, as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] to raise finance. Where banks may be reluctant to accept traditional collateral, for example in [[developing countries]] where [[land registration|land title]] may be lacking, inventory credit is a potentially important way of overcoming financing constraints. This is not a new concept; archaeological evidence suggests that it was practiced in Ancient Rome. Obtaining finance against stocks of a wide range of products held in a [[bonded warehouse]] is common in much of the world. It is, for example, used with Parmesan cheese in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italiannotebook.com/local-interest/parmigiano-hedge/|title=Who moved my Parmigiano?|work=italiannotebook.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126133935/http://www.italiannotebook.com/local-interest/parmigiano-hedge/|archivedate=2013-01-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inventory credit on the basis of stored agricultural produce is widely used in Latin American countries and in some Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Jonathan|last1=Coulter|first2=Andrew W.|last2=Shepherd|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/v7470e/v7470e00.htm|title=Inventory Credit – An approach to developing agricultural markets|website=fao.org|location=Rome|year=1995|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314040802/http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/V7470E/V7470E00.HTM|archivedate=2009-03-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A precondition for such credit is that banks must be confident that the stored product will be available if they need to call on the collateral; this implies the existence of a reliable network of certified warehouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CTA and EAGC|title=Structured grain trading systems in Africa|url=http://publications.cta.int/media/publications/downloads/1749_PDF.pdf|publisher=CTA|accessdate=27 February 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002180749/http://publications.cta.int/media/publications/downloads/1749_PDF.pdf|archivedate=2 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banks also face problems in valuing the inventory. The possibility of sudden falls in commodity prices means that they are usually reluctant to lend more than about 60% of the value of the inventory at the time of the loan.

[[File:Baphomet.png|thumb|right|The [[Baphomet]], from Eliphas Levi's ''Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie'', 1854, adopted symbol of some western esoteric "Left-Hand Path" [[life stance|belief systems]].]]

In [[Western esotericism]] the '''Left-Hand Path''' and '''Right-Hand Path''' are the [[dichotomy]] between two opposing approaches to magic. This terminology is used in various groups involved in the [[occult]] and [[ceremonial magic]]. In some definitions, the ''Left-Hand Path'' is equated with malicious [[black magic]] and the ''Right-Hand Path'' with benevolent [[white magic]].&lt;ref name=evans&gt;{{Cite book|last=Evans|first=Dave |title=The History of British Magick after Crowley |publisher=Hidden Publishing|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|152}} Other occultists have criticised this definition, believing that the Left–Right dichotomy refers merely to different kinds of working and does not necessarily connote good or bad magical actions.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|176}}

In more recent definitions, which base themselves on the terms' origins in Indian [[Tantra]], the Right-Hand Path, or RHP, is seen as a definition for those magical groups that follow specific ethical codes and adopt [[Convention (norm)|social convention]], while the Left-Hand Path adopts the opposite attitude, espousing the breaking of [[taboo]] and the abandoning of set [[morality]]. Some contemporary occultists, such as Peter J. Carroll, have stressed that both paths can be followed by a magical practitioner, as essentially they have the same goals.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

== Terminology ==

=== Right-Hand Path ===
The Right-Hand Path is commonly thought to refer to magical or religious groups which adhere to a certain set of characteristics:
* They divide the concepts of [[mind]], [[Human body|body]] and [[spirit]] into three separate, albeit interrelated, entities.&lt;ref name="Hine, Phil 2007 Page 204"&gt;Hine, Phil, quoted in Evans, Dave (2007). ''The History of British Magick after Crowley''. Hidden Publishing. p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;
* They adhere to a specific moral code and a belief in some form of judgement, such as [[karma]] or the [[Threefold Law]].&lt;ref name="Hine, Phil 2007 Page 204"/&gt;

The occultists [[Dion Fortune]]&lt;ref&gt;Fortune, Dion; ''The Mystical Qabalah'', Aquarian Press, 1987, {{ISBN|0-85030-335-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William G. Gray]]&lt;ref&gt;Gray, William; ''Exorcising The Tree of Evil: How To Use The Symbolism Of The Qabalistic Tree of Life To Recognise And Reverse Negative Energy'', [Helios/Weisers/Kima Global], 1974/1984/2002, (originally The Tree of Evil)&lt;/ref&gt; consider non-magical [[Abrahamic religions]] to be RHP.

=== Left-Hand Path ===
The historian Dave Evans studied self-professed followers of the Left-Hand Path in the early 21st century, making several observations about their practices:
*They often reject societal convention and the [[status quo]], which some suggest is in a search for spiritual freedom. As a part of this, LHP followers embrace magical techniques that would traditionally be viewed as [[taboo]], for instance using [[sex magic]] or embracing [[Satanism|Satanic]] imagery.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|197}} As Mogg Morgan wrote, the "breaking of taboos makes magic more potent and can lead to reintegration and liberation, [for example] the eating of meat in a [[vegetarian]] community can have the same liberating effect as [[anal intercourse]] in a sexually inhibited straight society."&lt;ref&gt;Shual. ''Sexual Magic''. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
* They often question religious or moral [[dogma]], instead adhering to forms of personal [[anarchism]].&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|198}}
* They often embrace [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and incorporate it into magical ritual.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|205}}

=== Criticism ===
Criticism of both terms has come from various occultists. The Magister of the Cultus Sabbati, [[Andrew D. Chumbley]], stated that they were simply "theoretical constructs" that were "without definitive objectivity", and that nonetheless, both forms could be employed by the magician. He used the analogy of a person having two hands, a right and a left, both of which served the same master.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Chumbley|Chumbley, Andrew]], quoted in Evans, Dave (2007). ''The History of British Magick after Crowley''. Hidden Publishing. pp. 212-213.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar sentiments were expressed by the [[Wicca]]n High Priest [[John Belham-Payne]], who stated that "For me, magic is magic."&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Chumbley|Chumbley, Andrew]], quoted in Evans, Dave (2007). ''The History of British Magick after Crowley''. Hidden Publishing. p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the terms ==

=== Vamachara ===
{{Main|Vamachara}}
''Vāmācāra'' is a [[Sanskrit]] term meaning "left-handed attainment" and is synonymous with Left-Hand Path or Left-path (Sanskrit: ''Vāmamārga'').&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharya, N. N. ''History of the Tantric Religion'' pp. 81, 447. (1999) {{ISBN|81-7304-025-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tantra, ''Vamamarga'' [http://www.ecstaticawareness.com/id13.html (The Left Handed Path: [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]] sadhana)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523175705/http://ecstaticawareness.com/id13.html |date=2012-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to describe a particular mode of worship or spiritual practice (Sanskrit: ''[[sadhana]]'') that is not only [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]] (Sanskrit: ''[[Nāstika]]'') to standard [[Vedic]] injunction, but extreme in comparison to prevailing cultural norms. These practices are often generally considered to be [[tantra|Tantric]] in orientation. The converse term to ''Vāmācāra'' is ''[[Dakshinachara]]'' (glossed "Right-Hand Path") which is used to refer not only to orthodox (''Āstika'') sects but to modes of spirituality that engage in spiritual practices that not only accord with Vedic injunction but are generally agreeable to prevailing cultural norms. That said, left-handed and right-handed modes of practice may be evident in both orthodox and heterodox schools of [[Indian religions|Dharmic religions]] such as [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Buddhism]] and are a matter of taste, culture, proclivity, initiation, ''sadhana'' and dharmic lineage (''[[parampara]]'').

=== Tantra and Madame Blavatsky ===
The occidental use of the terms ''Left-Hand Path'' and ''Right Hand-Path'' originated with [[Madame Blavatsky]], a 19th-century occultist who founded the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical Society]]. She had travelled across parts of [[southern Asia]] and claimed to have met with many mystics and magical practitioners in [[India]] and [[Tibet]]. She developed the term ''Left-Hand Path'' as a translation of the term [[Vamachara]], an Indian [[Tantra|Tantric]] practice that emphasised the breaking of Hindu societal taboos by having [[sexual intercourse]] in ritual, drinking [[alcohol]], eating [[meat]] and assembling in graveyards, as a part of the spiritual practice. The term ''Vamachara'' literally meant "the left-hand way" in [[Sanskrit]], and it was from this that Blavatsky first coined the term.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|178}}

Returning to Europe, Blavatsky began using the term. It was relatively easy for her to associate ''left'' with [[evil]] in many European countries, where it already had an association with many negative things; as the historian Dave Evans noted, [[homosexuals]] were referred to as "left-handed", and while in [[Protestant]] nations [[Roman Catholics]] were called "left-footers".&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|177}}

=== Adoption into the western esoteric tradition ===
In New York, Madame Blavatsky founded the [[Theosophical Society]] with several other people in 1875. She set about writing several books, including ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'' (1877) in which she introduced the terms ''Left-Hand Path'' and ''Right-Hand Path'', firmly stating that she herself followed the RHP, and that followers of the LHP were practitioners of Black Magic who were a threat to society. The occult community soon picked up on her newly introduced duality, which, according to historian Dave Evans, "had not been known before" in the Western Esoteric Tradition.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|181–182}} For instance, [[Dion Fortune]], the founder of an esoteric magical group (the [[Society of the Inner Light]]) also took the side of the RHP, making the claim that "black magicians", or followers of the LHP, were [[homosexuals]] and that Indian servants might use malicious magical rites devoted to the goddess [[Kali]] against their European masters.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|183–184}}

[[Aleister Crowley]] further altered and popularized the term in certain occult circles, referring to a "Brother of the Left-Hand Path", or a "Black Brother", as one who failed to attain the grade of [[A∴A∴#Magister Templi|Magister Templi]] in Crowley's system of ceremonial magic.&lt;ref name="payattention"&gt;[http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/mwt/mwt_12.html Magick Without Tears]&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley also referred to the Left-Hand Path when describing the point at which the [[A∴A∴#Adeptus Exemptus|Adeptus Exemptus]] (such as his old Christian mentor, [[Macgregor Mathers]]) chooses to cross the Abyss, which is the location of [[Choronzon]] and the illusory eleventh [[Sephirot|Sephira]], which is [[Da'at (Kabbalah)|Da'ath]] or Knowledge. In this example, the adept must surrender all, including the guidance of his [[Holy Guardian Angel]], and leap into the Abyss. If his accumulated [[Karma]] is sufficient, and if he has been utterly thorough in his own self-destruction, he becomes a "babe of the abyss", arising as a Star in the Crowleyan system. On the other hand, if he retains some fragment of ego, or if he fears to cross, he then becomes encysted. The layers of his self, which he could have shed in the Abyss, ossify around him. He is then titled a "Brother of the Left-Hand Path", who will eventually be broken up and disintegrated against his will, since he failed to choose voluntary disintegration.&lt;ref name="payattention" /&gt; Crowley associated all this with "Mary, a blasphemy against [[BABALON]]", and with the celibacy of Christian clergy.&lt;ref name="payattention" /&gt;

Another of those figures that Fortune considered to be a follower of the LHP was [[Arthur Edward Waite]], who did not recognise these terms, and acknowledged that they were newly introduced and that in any case he believed the terms LHP and RHP to be distinct from black and white magic.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|182–183}} However, despite Waite's attempts to distinguish the two, the equation of the LHP with Black Magic was propagated more widely in the fiction of [[Dennis Wheatley]]; Wheatley also conflated the two with [[Satanism]] and also the political ideology of [[communism]], which he viewed as a threat to traditional British society.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|189–190}} In one of his novels, ''Strange Conflict'' (1941), he stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
|
:The Order of the Left-Hand Path... has its adepts... the Way of Darkness is perpetuated in the horrible [[West African Vodun|Voodoo]] cult which had its origins in [[Madagascar]] and has held [[Africa]], the Dark Continent, in its grip for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dennis Wheatley|Wheatley, Dennis]] (1941). ''Strange Conflict''.&lt;/ref&gt;
|
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Later 20th and 21st centuries===
In the latter half of the 20th century various groups arose that self-professedly described themselves as LHP, but did not consider themselves as following [[Black Magic]]. In 1975, [[Kenneth Grant]], a student of Aleister Crowley, explained in ''Cults of the Shadow'' that he and his group, the [[Typhonian Order]], practiced the LHP. Grant's usage takes meaning from its roots in eastern Tantra; Grant states that it is about challenging taboos, but that it should be used in conjunction with the RHP to achieve balance.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|193}}

When [[Anton Szandor LaVey]] was developing his form of [[LaVeyan Satanism]] during the 1960s, he emphasised the rejection of traditional Christian morality and as such labelled his new philosophy to be a form of the Left-Hand Path. In his ''[[The Satanic Bible]]'', he wrote that "Satanism is not a white light religion; it is a religion of the flesh, the mundane, the carnal—all of which are ruled by Satan, the personification of the Left Hand Path."&lt;ref&gt;LaVey, Anton Szandor. ''The Satanic Bible''. The Book of Lucifer 3: paragraph 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia there is a tradition of Left Hand Path practices within the [[Rodnovery|Rodnover]] community under the influence of [[Volhv]] [[Veleslav]],&lt;ref&gt;Чёрная Книга Мары» (2008) - The Black Book of Mary; Шуйный путь: чёрная книга нави» (2011) - Шуйный путь: The Black Book of the Navi [NOTE: 'Шуйный путь' remains untranslated to distinguish it from the Shuyngj Way within Odinism]; Книга Великой Нави: Хаософия и Русское Навославие» (2011) - The Book of the Great Navi: Хаософия (The Wisdom of Chaos [Chaosophy]) and Russian Навославие (Praising of the Navi).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and within the [[Odinism|Odinist]] community with [[Askr Svarte]],&lt;ref&gt;http://nikarevleshy.blogspot.ru/2013/06/evgeny-nechkasov-askr-svarte.html, {{cite web |url=http://www.users.on.net/~mmellors_nbn/4.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217064149/http://www.users.on.net/~mmellors_nbn/4.htm |archivedate=2015-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in England with [[Nikarev Leshy]]. Veleslav has also written numerous books on Tantra and the Left Hand Path.&lt;ref&gt;[[Veleslav#Written works]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen E. Flowers, Ph.D. of the Temple of Set states in his book ''Lords of the Left Hand Path: A History of Spiritual Dissent'' there are two criteria to be considered a true Lord of the Left Hand Path and they are Self-Deification and [[Antinomianism#Left-hand path|Antinomianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Lords of the Left Hand Path: A History of Spiritual Dissent by Stephen E. Flowers Ph.D. pg.4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage in Tantra ==
[[Tantra]] is a set of [[esoteric]] [[India]]n traditions with roots in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. Tantra is often divided by its practitioners into two different paths: ''[[dakshinachara]]'' and ''[[vamachara]]'', translated as ''Right-Hand Path'' and ''Left-Hand Path'' respectively. Dakshinachara consists of traditional Hindu practices such as [[asceticism]] and [[meditation]], while vamachara also includes ritual practices that conflict with mainstream Hinduism, such as [[sexual ritual]]s, consumption of [[alcohol]] and other [[intoxicant]]s. The two paths are viewed by Tantrists as equally valid approaches to [[bodhi|enlightenment]]. Vamachara, however, is often considered to be the faster&lt;ref&gt;p. 265 ''Shakti: Realm of the Divine Mother'', Vanamali, Inner Traditions. {{ISBN|1-59477-199-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Vajrayana#Paramitayana and Vajrayana|Distinguishing Paramitayana from Mantrayana]] in ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism'', Robert E. Buswell, Ed., Macmillan USA, New York, NY, 2004. {{ISBN|0-02-865910-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and more dangerous of the two paths, and is not suitable for all practitioners. The usage of the terms Left-Hand Path and Right-Hand Path is still current in modern Indian and Buddhist Tantra.

===Left-Hand Path relation to Tantra in Buddhism===
Robert Beér's ''Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs'' clarifies widespread taboos and deprecation that associate the left hand as dark, female, inferior and 'not right':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In Buddhist tantra, the right hand symbolises the male aspect of compassion or skilful means, and the left hand represents the female aspect of wisdom or emptiness. Ritual hand-held attributes, such as the vajra and bell, vajra and lotus, damaru and bell, damaru and khatvanga, arrow and bow, curved knife and skull-cup, sword and shield, hook and rope snare, etc., placed in the right and left hands respectively, symbolise the union of the active male aspect of skilful means with the contemplative female aspect of wisdom.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In both Hinduism and Buddhism the goddess is always placed on the left side of the male deity, where she 'sits on his left thigh, while her lord places his left arm over her left shoulder and dallies with her left breast'.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In representations of the Buddha image, the right hand often makes an active mudra of skilful means—the earth-touching, protection, fearlessness, wish-granting or teaching mudra; while the left hand often remains in the passive mudra of meditative equipoise, resting in the lap and symbolising meditation on emptiness or wisdom."&lt;ref&gt;Beér, Robert; ''The encyclopedia of Tibetan symbols and motifs'', Serindia Publications, Inc., 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beér's preceding explanations correspond to [[Yab-Yum]] (father-mother) symbolism and contemplation on or practice of [[sexual ritual]]s associated with [[Vajrayogini]] and [[Anuttarayoga Tantra]]. Yab-yum is generally understood to represent the primordial (or mystical) union of wisdom and compassion. The metaphorical union of bliss and emptiness is commonly represented within [[Thangka]] paintings of the [[Cakrasaṃvara Tantra]] depicting the sexual union of the deity Saṃvara and his consort [[Dorje Pakmo]].

'''Leibniz's gap''' is a [[philosophy of mind]] term that is used to refer to the problem that thoughts cannot be observed or perceived solely by examining [[brain]] properties, events, and processes. Here the word 'gap' is a [[metaphor]] of a subquestion regarding the [[mind–body problem]] that allegedly must be answered in order to reach more profound understanding of [[consciousness]] and [[emergence]]. A [[theory]] that could correlate brain phenomena with [[Psychology|psychological]] phenomena would "bridge the gap." The term is named after [[Gottfried Leibniz]] who first presented the problem in his work ''[[The Monadology]]'' in 1714. Leibniz's passage describing the gap goes as follows:

{{cquote|It must be confessed, moreover, that perception, and that which depends on it, are inexplicable by mechanical causes, that is, by figures and motions, And, supposing that there were a mechanism so constructed as to think, feel and have perception, we might enter it as into a mill. And this granted, we should only find on visiting it, pieces which push one against another, but never anything by which to explain a perception. This must be sought, therefore, in the simple substance, and not in the composite or in the machine.|author=Gottfried Leibniz|source=[http://people.uvawise.edu/philosophy/phil206/Leibniz.html ''Monadology'']}}

Leibniz himself sought to bridge the gap by introducing monads to explain the existence of immaterial, eternal souls. Leibniz's gap, however, applies to [[materialism]] and [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] alike. This brought late 19th century scientists to conclude that psychology must build on [[introspection]]; thus [[introspectionism]] was born. [[Computationalism]] seeks to answer the problem proposed by Leibniz's gap through functional analysis of the brain and its processes. Today the term Leibniz's gap is still in wide use in scientific debate as the mind body problem remains unsolved.

The '''ludic fallacy''', identified by [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] in his book ''[[The Black Swan (Taleb book)|The Black Swan]]'' ([[2007 in books|2007]]), is "the misuse of [[game]]s to model real-life situations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sicart |first=François |url=http://www.tocqueville.com/article/show/204 |title=Black Swans, the Ludic Fallacy and Wealth Management |publisher=Tocqueville |date=26 February 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223090355/http://www.tocqueville.com/article/show/204 |archivedate=2007-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taleb explains the fallacy as "basing studies of chance on the narrow world of games and dice".&lt;ref name="blackswan"&gt;Taleb, Nassim (2007). ''The Black Swan''. New York: Random House. p. 309. {{ISBN|1-4000-6351-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective ''ludic'' originates from the Latin noun ''[[wikt:ludus|ludus]]'', meaning "play, game, sport, pastime".&lt;ref name="simpson1987"&gt;Simpson, D.P. (1987). ''Cassell's Latin and English Dictionary''. New York: Hungry Minds. p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The fallacy is a central argument in the book and a rebuttal of the predictive mathematical models used to predict the future – as well as an attack on the idea of applying naïve and simplified statistical models in complex domains. According to Taleb, statistics is applicable only in some domains, for instance [[casino]]s in which the odds are visible and defined. Taleb's argument centers on the idea that predictive models are based on [[platonic realism|platonified forms]], gravitating towards mathematical purity and failing to take various aspects into account:{{fact|date=November 2018}}

* It is impossible to be in possession of the entirety of available information.
* Small unknown variations in the data could have a huge impact. Taleb differentiates his idea from that of mathematical notions in [[chaos theory]] (e.g., the [[butterfly effect]]).
* Theories or models based on empirical data are claimed to be flawed as they may not be able to predict events which are previously unobserved, but have tremendous impact (e.g., the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terrorist attacks]] or the [[History of the automobile|invention of the automobile]]), a.k.a. [[black swan theory]].

==Examples==
===Example: Suspicious coin===
One example given in the book is the following [[thought experiment]]. Two people are involved:
* Dr. John who is regarded as a man of science and logical thinking
* Fat Tony who is regarded as a man who lives by his wits

A third party asks them to "assume that a coin is fair, i.e., has an equal probability of coming up heads or tails when flipped. I flip it ninety-nine times and get heads each time. What are the odds of my getting tails on my next throw?"
* Dr. John says that the odds are not affected by the previous outcomes so the odds must still be [[Odds#Even odds|50:50]].
* Fat Tony says that the odds of the coin coming up heads 99 times in a row are so low that the initial assumption that the coin had a 50:50 chance of coming up heads is most likely incorrect.  "The coin gotta be loaded. It can't be a fair game."

The ludic fallacy here is to assume that in real life the rules from the purely hypothetical model (where Dr. John is correct) apply.  Would a reasonable person bet on black on a [[roulette]] table that has come up red 99 times in a row (especially as the reward for a correct guess is so low when compared with the probable odds that the game is fixed)?{{Clarify|reason=what are "probable odds" - would a reasonable person bet on a far roulette wheel?|date=February 2017}}

In classical terms, [[statistically significant]] events, i.e. unlikely events, should make one question one's model assumptions. In [[Bayesian statistics]], this can be modelled by using a [[prior distribution]] for one's assumptions on the fairness of the coin, then [[Bayesian inference]] to update this distribution.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Example: Fighting===
Nassim Taleb shares an example that comes from his friend and trading partner, [[Mark Spitznagel]]. "A martial version of the ludic fallacy: organized competitive fighting trains the athlete to focus on the game and, in order not to dissipate his concentration, to ignore the possibility of what is not specifically allowed by the rules, such as kicks to the groin, a surprise knife, et cetera. So those who win gold medal might be precisely those who will be most vulnerable in real life."&lt;ref name=blackswan/&gt;

==Relation to platonicity==
The ludic fallacy is a specific case of the more general problem of platonicity, defined by Nassim Taleb as:
{{bq|quote=the focus on those pure, well-defined, and easily discernible objects like triangles, or more social notions like friendship or love, at the cost of ignoring those objects of seemingly messier and less tractable structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The '''Exile of Mawzaʻ''' (the expulsion of Yemenite Jews to [[Mawza District|Mawza']]) {{lang-he-n|גלות מוזע}}, {{IPA-he|''ğalūt mawzaʻ''|pron}};&amp;lrm; 1679–1680, is considered the single most traumatic event experienced collectively by the [[Jews of Yemen]],&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Yuval Tobi, "Attitude of the Muslim Authority in Yemen to the Jewish Messianic Movements", in: ''Ascending the Palm Tree – An Anthology of the Yemenite Jewish Heritage'', Rachel Yedid &amp; Danny Bar-Maoz (ed.), E'ele BeTamar: Rehovot 2018, p. 135 {{OCLC|1041776317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yehudah Ratzaby, ''Galut Mawzaʻ'', Sefunot (Volume Five), Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1961, p. 79 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; in which Jews living in nearly all cities and towns throughout Yemen were banished by decree of the king, Imām [[al-Mahdi Ahmad]], and sent to a dry and barren region of the country named Mawzaʻ to withstand their fate or to die. Only a few communities, ''viz.'', those Jewish inhabitants who lived in the far eastern quarters of Yemen ([[Nihm District|Nihm]], [[Al Jawf Governorate|al-Jawf]], and [[Khwlan District|Khawlan]] of the east&lt;ref&gt;The one exception being Tan'am, which although it lies in the principality of Khawlan, was not spared the fate of exile.&lt;/ref&gt;) were spared this fate by virtue of their Arab patrons who refused to obey the king's orders.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi Ḥayim Ḥibshush," Sefunot, Volume 2, Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1958, pp. 246-286 (Hebrew); Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 714 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; Many would die along the route and while confined to the hot and arid conditions of this forbidding terrain. After one year in exile, the exiles were called back to perform their usual tasks and labors for the indigenous Arab populations, who had been deprived of goods and services on account of their exile.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yosef Qafiḥ]] (ed.), "Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman by Rabbi Ḥayim Ḥibshush," ''Ketavim'' (Collected Papers), Vol. 2, Jerusalem 1989, p. 714 (end); [[Amram Qorah]], ''Sa'arat Teiman'', Jerusalem 1987, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
With the rise to power of the Qāsimīd Imām, [[al-Mutawakkil Isma'il]] (1644–1676), there was a crucial turning point in the condition of Jews living under the Imamate kingdom of Yemen. He endorsed the most hostile policies toward his Jewish subjects, partly due to the claim that the Jews were aiding the Ottoman Turks during the local uprising against them.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Tobi, ''Politics and Poetry in the Works of Shalom Shabazī'', Routledge - ''Israel Affairs'' 2014, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the [[Shabbathian]] movement in Yemen in 1666 exacerbated the problems facing the community, calling into question their status as protected wards of the State. One decree led to another.&lt;ref&gt;One Jewish poet bewails their fate at this time, saying: "Since the day that they removed the turbans from our heads (i.e. 1666), we are full of orders which he decrees [against us]. He has placed over our heads [a governor] who is the master of oppression!" See: Ratzaby, ''Sefunot'' (Volume Five), Jerusalem 1961, p. 378 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; The king initially demanded their conversion to Islam and when they refused, he made them stand out in the sun without apparel for three days, which was later followed by harsher decrees. It is said that al-Mutawakkil Isma'il consulted with the religious scholars of Islam and sought to determine whether or not the laws concerning Jews in the Arabian Peninsula applied also to Yemen, citing [[Muhammad]] who was reported as saying, "There shall not be two religions in Arabia." When it was determined that these laws did indeed apply to Yemen, since the country was an indivisible part of the Arabian Peninsula, it then became incumbent upon Jews living in Yemen to either convert to Islam or to leave the country. Yet, since the king fell ill and was bedridden, he did not presently perform his ill-designs to expel the Jews from his kingdom, but commanded the heir to his throne, al-Mahdi Ahmad, to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13537121.2014.889893#.U_Q_qcJ0xjo Yosef Tobi, ''Politics and Poetry in the Works of Shalom Shabazī'', Routledge - ''Israel Affairs'' 2014, p. 7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Tobi, ''The Jews of Yemen'' (''Studies in Their History and Culture''), Brill: Leiden 1999, pp. 77-79&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Mahdi Ahmad of al-Ghirās, who is also known by the epithet ''Ṣafī al-Din'' (purity of religion), succeeded al-Mutawakkil Isma'il, but perpetuated the same hostilities toward his Jewish subjects as those made by his predecessor. Everything reached its climax between the years 1677 and 1680, when he ordered the destruction of the synagogues in Sana'a and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Tanḥum ben Joseph, of Jerusalem, ''al-Murshid al-kāfi'' (in manuscript form), p. 112 (Yosef Tobi's Private Collection), we read the following marginal note: "The synagogue was destroyed here, [in] Ḥamdah, on Wednesday, the 17th day of the lunar month Teveth, in the year 1,989 [of the Seleucid Era] (=1678 CE), by order of al-Mahdi and Muhammad ben Ahmad." Yehudah Ratzaby (1984, p. 149) also brings down a manuscript extracted from the binding of an old book, now at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York (239), in which the author complains: "The razing of the synagogue of Būsān on the fourth day of the week which is the third day of the year 1,989 [of the Seleucid Era] (= 1678 CE), and the enemies forbade us to gather as a quorum of ten for prayer and three scrolls of Law were slashed to pieces. May He in His mercy save us and all Israel from all the decrees." (See: Yosef Tobi, ''The Jews of Yemen'' - ''Studies in Their History and Culture'', Brill: Leiden 1999, pp. 78 [end] - 79)&lt;/ref&gt;  By early summer of 1679, he gave an ultimatum unto his Jewish subjects, namely, that they had the choice of either converting to Islam, in which they'd be allowed to remain in the country, or of being killed by the sword. He gave to them three months to decide what they would do.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi Ḥayim Ḥibshush," [https://web.archive.org/web/20141022152755/http://www.ybz.org.il/_Uploads/dbsArticles/sefunotII_OCR.pdf#page=270 ''Sefunot'', Volume Two, Jerusalem 1958], page רסב (p. 270 in PDF) (Hebrew); Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim'' (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 713 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

The king's words led to no small consternation amongst his Jewish subjects in Yemen, who immediately declared a time of public fasting and prayer, which they did both by night and day. Their plight soon became known to the local Yemeni tribesmen, whose chiefs and principal men pitied their condition and intervened on their behalf. They came before the king and enquired concerning the decree, and insisted that the Jews had been loyal to their king and had not offended the Arab peoples, neither had they done anything worthy of death, but should only be punished a little for their "obduracy" in what concerns the religion of Islam. The king, agreeing to their counsel, chose not to kill his Jewish subjects, but decided to banish them from his kingdom. They were to be sent to [[Zeila|Zeilaʻ]], a place along the African coast of the [[Red Sea]], where they would be confined for life, or else repent and accept the tenets of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi Ḥayim Ḥibshush," ''Sefunot'', Volume Two, Jerusalem 1958], page רסג (Hebrew); Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim'' (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 714 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

== [[Sana'a]] ==
The Jewish community in Sana'a was concentrated in the neighborhood of al-Sā'ilah, within the walled city, as one enters Bab al-Shaʻub (the Shaʻub Gate) on Sana'a's north side. The chief rabbi of the Jewish community at that time was an elder to whom they gave the title of Prince (''nasi''), Rabbi Suleiman al-Naqqāsh,&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Tobi, ''Studies in 'Megillat Teman' '' (''ʻIyunim bi-megilat Teman''), The Magnes Press – Hebrew University, Jerusalem 1986, p. 42, note 68 (Hebrew). According to [[Erich Brauer]], the title of ''nasi'' was conferred upon a man belonging to the community's most noble and richest family. There was no direct election for this post. In general, the ''nasi'' was also a scholar, well-versed in Torah, but this was not a condition for his office. Among his duties, he was a representative of the community in all its affairs before the government. He was also entrusted with the duty of collecting the annual poll-tax (''ğizya''), as also to settle disputes arising between members of the community (E. Brauer, ''Ethnologie der jemenitischen Juden'', Heidelberg 1934, pp. 281–282).&lt;/ref&gt; while the city's chief seat of learning was under the tutelage of Rabbi and Judge, Shelomo ben Saadia al-Manzeli (''resh methivta'').&lt;ref&gt;Yiḥya Saleḥ, ''Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim Hashalem'' (ed. Shimon Saleh), vol. 1, Jerusalem 1971, s.v. ''Shaḥrith shel Shabbath''. Rabbi Shelomo ben Saadia al-Manzeli (1610–1690) is said to have returned to his post after the Mawza Exile, serving as both President of the court at Ṣan'ā' and the city's spiritual instructor. He helped draft a series of enactments meant at bettering the spiritual condition of the Jewish community, by way of merit, and thereby hoping to prevent the recurrence of harsh decrees against the community in the future. See: Moshe Gavra, ''Meḥqarim basiddurei tayman'': ''Studies in the Prayer Books of Yemen'', vol. 1, Benei Barak 2010, p. 70 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews of Sana'a were given but short notice about the things that were about to happen to them.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Yosef Qafih believes that they were given advance warning as early as late-summer of 1678. See: Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi Ḥayim Ḥibshush," ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 713, note 130 (Hebrew). According to Arabic sources, Imām al-Mahdī had ordered the newly appointed governor of [[Sana'a]], Muhammad ibn al-Mutawakkil, to expel the Jews and demolish their synagogues on 1 Shaʻbān 1088 ''anno'' Hijri (= 29 September 1677), nearly two years before the actual expulsion. The matter was delayed only because the governor wished to consult first with the religious scholars of his city. All this may have been done without the foreknowledge of the Jewish community. (See: ''Yemenite Authorities and Jewish Messianism'', by P.S. van Koningsveld, J. Sadan and Q. Al-Samarrai, Leiden University 1990, p. 23)&lt;/ref&gt; They had been advised to sell their houses, fields and vineyards, and that all property which they were unable to sell would automatically be confiscated and accrue to the Public Treasury (Ar. ''al-māl''), without recompense.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi Ḥayim Ḥibshush," ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 714 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1679, when the king saw that they were unrelenting in their fathers' faith, he then decided to follow through with what he had determined for them and issued a decree, banishing all Jews in his kingdom to the Red Sea outpost known as [[Zeila]]'. On the 2nd day of the lunar month [[Rajab]], in the year 1090 of the [[Hijri calendar]] (corresponds with [[Gregorian calendar]], August 10, 1679), his edict was put into effect, and he ordered the Jews of Sana'a to take leave of their places, but gave more space to the provincial governors of Yemen to begin the expulsion of all other Jews in Yemen to Zeila', and which should be accomplished by them in a time period not to exceed twelve months. The Jews of Sana'a had, meanwhile, set out on their journey, leaving behind them their homes and possessions, rather than exchange their religion for another. In doing so, they brought [[Kiddush Hashem|sanctity]] to God's name.&lt;ref&gt;In accordance with a teaching in Leviticus 22:31–32, and explained in the ''Responsa of Rabbi [[David ben Zimra|David ibn Zimra]]'',vol. 2 (part 4), ''responsum'' no. 92 [1163], Warsaw 1882 (reprinted), p. 47 (Hebrew pagination כד). Here, the author makes it clear that if Jews are collectively compelled by the [[Ismaelites]] to convert to Islam or else face punishment, they are to prefer punishment rather than exchange their religion for another, and, in so doing, they bring sanctity to God's name.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Suleiman al-Naqqāsh, by his wisdom and care for his community, had preemptively made arrangements for the community's safety and upkeep by sending written notifications to the Jewish communities which lay along the route, requesting that they provide food and assistance to their poor Jewish brethren when they passed through their communities in the coming weeks or days. The king's soldiers were sent to escort the exiles unto their final destination, while the king himself had sent orders to the governors of the outlying districts and places where it was known that the Jewish exiles were to pass through while ''en route'' to Zeila', commanding them not to permit any Jew to remain in those cities when they reached them, but to send them on in their journey.&lt;ref&gt;[[Avraham Al-Naddaf|Avraham al-Naddaf]], ''Ḥoveret'' (article: ''History of Rabbi Sholem al-Shabazi''), Jerusalem 1928 (Hebrew); Reprinted in ''Zechor le'Avraham'', by Uziel al-Nadaf, (Part II) Jerualem 1992 (Hebrew), pp. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unexpected turn of events==
[[File:Jewish Mother and Daughter, December 1, 1949.jpg|thumb|right|Jewish mother and daughter in Yemen, 1949]]
Meanwhile, while columns of men, women and children were advancing by foot southward with only bare essentials, along the road leading from Sana'a to [[Dhamar, Yemen|Dhamar]], [[Yarim]], '[[Ibb]] and [[Ta'izz]], the chiefs of the indigenous Sabaean tribes who had been the patrons of the Jews came together once again and petitioned the king, [[Al-Mahdi Ahmad|al-Mahdi]], this time requesting that the king rescind his order to expel all Jews unto the Red Sea outpost of Zeila', but to be content with their banishment to the [[Tihama]] coastal town of Mawza'. The reason being for this urgent request was that, by taking into consideration their troubles in a barren wasteland, those that will remain of them will be more inclined to repent and to choose the way of Islam, in which case it will be easier to hoist them from that place and to bring them back unto their former places. The grandees reminded the king how they had been faithful in implementing his orders. At hearing this, the king agreed and sent orders to the effect that Jewish exiles should be conducted only to Mawza'.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," ''Ketavim'' (Collected Papers), Vol. 2, Jerusalem 1989, p. 714 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the Jews of Sana'a reached Dhamar, they had already been joined by the Jewish villagers of Siān and Tan'am (located about {{convert|15|km|mi|order=flip}}  eastward of Bayt al-Ḥāḍir, southeast Sana'a), all of which places lie within Sana'a's periphery.&lt;ref&gt;Yehudah Ratzaby, Sefunot (Volume Five), his article: ''Galut Mawza''', Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1961, p. 367, s.v. poem entitled: אבן אלאסבאט אבדע, lines 16–19 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews had sent fifteen letters to the king in al-Ghirās, asking him to forgive them of whatever offense they may have made and to permit them to remain in their former settlements, yet none of these did he answer.&lt;ref&gt;Yehudah Ratzaby, Sefunot (Volume Five), his article: ''Galut Mawza' '', Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1961, p. 369, s.v. poem entitled: אבן אלאסבאט אבדע, lines 4–5 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evacuation of the Jews of Dhurān==
[[File:Yemenite Elder Blowing Shofat, February 1, 1949.jpg|thumb|Yemenite Jew blows the shofar, 1947]]
Around the beginning of September 1679, approximately one month after the Jews of Sana'a had set out for Mawza‛, Jews that hailed from Dhurān – a village situate about three days' walking distance southwest of Sana'a – were also evacuated from their village. In a letter written in 1684 to the Jewish community of [[Hebron]], only four years after the community's return to Dhurān, the author describes the sufferings of the Jews who were forced to leave their homes and to go into Mawza‛.&lt;ref&gt;Yehudah Ratzaby, ''Zion – A Quarterly for Research in Jewish History'', vol. xxxvii. The Historical Society of Israel: Jerusalem 1972, pp. 203-207 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; One important revelation that emerges from his account of these events is that the Jews of Yemen had tried to pacify the king's wrath by paying large sums of money to him, but which money the king refused to accept:

{{blockquote|….On account of our many iniquities,&lt;ref&gt;Hebrew expression of contriteness, signifying the people's acceptance of God's judgments and which expression is based on the Jewish teaching that all of God's ways are just.&lt;/ref&gt; God stirred up the spirit of the king who dwells in this country to banish us; we and our wives and our children, unto a barren desert, a place of serpents and scorpions and scorching fire; wrath pursues [us], so that there has been fulfilled in us [the Scripture that says]: '''And I shall bring them into the land of their enemies''' &lt;small&gt;(Lev. 26:41)&lt;/small&gt;. He has destroyed our synagogues, and has darkened the light of our eyes. 'Go away! [You are] unclean!' they cry out unto us, while the taskmasters are in a hurry, saying: 'Go away from here; purify yourselves!' &lt;small&gt;(Isa. 52:11)&lt;/small&gt;, and do not take pity upon any of your delectable things, lest the king should be sorely angry with you, [and] will kill you and your children, your aged men and your young men. Now if you should forsake your God whom you trust, and enter into our own religion, it will be well with you, seeing that He is no longer with you, but has already abandoned you in our hands; [we] being able to do with you as we please!' …Now, there is no one who helps us, whether of the deputies or of the ministers, for when they saw that we had given-up our souls unto martyrdom for His name sake, and that we had been obedient to His word and speech, they then conspired against us to eradicate our name with fierce anger. They said [to us], 'this despised and wretched nation, they have rejected our religion (i.e. Islam), whereas neither largess, nor gratis, would have made them come over.' …They banded together against us, they and their kings, their male servants and handmaids, so that small babes spat upon him who is greatest amongst us. …Now, God has hidden His face from us, 'while we have all faded like a leaf' &lt;small&gt;(Isa. 64:5)&lt;/small&gt;. We went with shame and with reproach, in hunger and in thirst, and in nakedness and in deprivation of all things, unto that place which the king had decreed over us, for he had no wish for money, but rather in seeing our destruction.}}

The author goes on to explain how that, when they reached their destination, they wept bitterly, since many of them had perished as in a plague, and they were unable to bury them because of the excruciating heat. When some of their party had tried to escape at night, approximately seventy men, the next morning when the sun arose they were stricken down by the intense heat, and there they died. The author concludes by saying, "Now, this decree of exile was at the beginning of ''[[anno mundi]]'' 5440 (= 1679 CE), and the blessed God redeemed us at the [year's] end; the sign of which being: 'The punishment of your iniquity has ''ended'' ' &lt;small&gt;(Lam. 4:22)&lt;/small&gt;." Here, the author makes a play on words; the Hebrew word for "ended" (Heb. תם) having the numerical value of 440, the same as the year when abbreviated without the millennium.&lt;ref&gt;Yehudah Ratzaby, ''Zion – A Quarterly for Research in Jewish History'', vol. xxxvii. The Historical Society of Israel: Jerusalem 1972, p. 207 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mawzaʻ==
[[File:Tihama Coastal Plain, Yemen 1931.jpg|thumb|right|The Tihama Coastal Plain - 1931]]

Mawzaʻ is a town situated eleven-days' walking distance from Sana'a, and ca. {{convert|20|km|mi|order=flip}} from the port of [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]], in the [[Tihama]] coastal plain. During their long trek there, the king's soldiers pressed them on. Many of the sick and elderly and children died along the way. Others would later succumb to the harsh weather conditions of that place. All, however, suffered from hunger and thirst.  Eventually, the community of Sana'a was joined by other Jewish communities from across Yemen. In Mawzaʻ they remained for one full year, until 1680, when the king's non-Jewish subjects began to complain about their lack of farm implements which had been exclusively made by Jewish craftsmen.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," Sefunot (Volume Two), Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1958, pp. 246–286 (Hebrew); Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim'' (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, pp. 714–715 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; The governor of [[`Amran]] went personally before the king with a petition to bring back his Jewish subjects. The king acquiesced and sent emissaries bearing food and water to call them back to their former cities.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Sassoon#Progeny|David Solomon Sassoon]], ''On the Origins of the Jews in Yemen'' (לקורות היהודים בתימן), Budapest 1931, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Some returned only to find their homes taken by usurping occupants. Others decided to move and to settle elsewhere in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman by Rabbi Ḥayim Ḥibshush''," Ketavim (Collected Papers), Vol. 2, Jerusalem 1989, p. 716 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Hayim Hibshush]], speaking somewhat about this time, writes: "For the duration of one year since this decree was first issued, they went as sheep to the slaughter from all the districts of Yemen, while none remained of all those districts who did not go into exile, excepting the district of Nihm towards the east, and the district of al-Jawf, as well as the eastern district of Khawlan."&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," Ketavim (Collected Papers), Vol. 2, Jerusalem 1989, p. 714 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical records==
[[File:Two Jewish Elders from Sana'a, Yemen, in 1904.jpg|thumb|Two Jewish Elders from Sana'a, 1904]]
Rabbi [[Yiḥyah Salaḥ]] (who is known by the acronym [[Maharitz (Yihya Salah)|Maharitz]]) gives a most captivating account of these harrowing events borne by the Jews of Sana'a in the years leading up to their expulsion, as also when they left their city, based on a hand-written document preserved and copied down by subsequent generations. Some have judged the sum and bearing of these events as a mere microscopic example of the sufferings experienced by the Jewish inhabitants as a whole, in each and every city throughout Yemen. Thus, he gives the following account:&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Tobi (ed.), ''Studies in 'Megillat Teman' '' by Yiḥyah Salaḥ, The Magnes Press: Hebrew University,  Jerusalem 1986, pp. 44-47 (based on MS. #1, Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=...In the year one thousand, nine-hundred and eighty-six [of the [[Seleucid Era]]] (1675{{nbsp}}CE) the king named [[Al-Mutawakkil Isma'il|Isma'il]] died, and there was a famine and many died. Then [[Al-Mahdi Ahmad|Aḥmad]], the son of Ḥasan, reigned in his stead, who was called al-Ḥasni, who expelled the Turks, and ruled by strength of arms, and was a man of exploits, and went up north and captured those districts, and went as far as to [[Yafa|al-Yāfaʻ]] [in the south] and captured it. And in the year one thousand, nine-hundred and eighty-seven [of the Seleucid Era] (1676 CE), he destroyed the synagogues of the Jews. Then in the year one thousand, nine-hundred and eighty-eight [of the Seleucid Era] (1677 CE) there was a famine, and in the year one thousand, nine-hundred and eighty-nine (1678 CE) he expelled Israel unto the desert of Mawzaʻ,&lt;ref&gt;Professor Yosef Tobi says that the date here is in error, and should rather be amended to read 1679.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a horrific place, and one known for its excruciating heat; its air being bad.  No man could proceed upon the ground on account of their over weariness and the blisters which effected their feet.

Now, during that same year, when they departed from Sana'a to go unto Mawzaʻ, there was a certain gentile unto whom they committed for safekeeping several scrolls of the Law and several books of the [[Talmud]], and of Bible codices and of [[Midrashic]] literature [aplenty], as well as several leather-bound books which had been composed by the early scholars in their own hand-writing, for they were not able to carry them because of the encumbrance along the way, since they had been driven out on a sudden, they and their wives and children. Now these books nearly filled up one large room. They were of the opinion that they could appease the king, and that they would return to take their books. And it came to pass when they were gone away, that that [wicked] man arose and set fire to them, and burnt them all. On that very hour, Israel became impoverished in all things, whether on account of their shortage of books, or on account of their own novellæ and commentaries being burnt. Nothing remained except a few things of what little they had, of scrolls of the Law and ''[[Gemara]]''s, and the other books which had been taken by the heads of the people in their own hands for their own needs in study and in reading from the books of the Law.

Now while they ventured out in exile, several wise and pious men perished along the way, and several families were utterly taken away from off the face of the earth. Now, it has been told to us that about eighty souls died in one short period of time during one single journey in the desert, near the village of Mawzaʻ, on account of iniquities. On that upcoming Sabbath when they reached the village of Mawzaʻ it happened to be the Sabbath reading for the biblical lection known as ''Beḥuḳḳothai'' &lt;small&gt;(Lev. 26:3-ff.)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This reading, based on the sequence of the biblical portions that are read throughout the year, would have been read the following year, in 1680.&lt;/ref&gt; and there stood up the greatest man amongst them to read the [[Tocheichah|Reproofs]], and when they came to the verse that says: ''And I shall bring them into the land of their enemies, perhaps then their uncircumcised heart should be brought under submission etc.'' &lt;small&gt;(Lev. 26:41)&lt;/small&gt;, and when he had then finished his reading, he began to expound [on that portion of the Law], and the spirit of God moved him, and he said that the present decree had been given from the start since ancient times, and is alluded to and is cleverly arranged and has been preserved in the acrostic at the end of each word [in the Hebrew verse], '''oyyaveihe&lt;big&gt;m&lt;/big&gt; '&lt;big&gt;o&lt;/big&gt; 'a&lt;big&gt;z&lt;/big&gt; yikan&lt;big&gt;a&lt;/big&gt;'' = אויביה&lt;big&gt;ם&lt;/big&gt; א&lt;big&gt;ו&lt;/big&gt; א&lt;big&gt;ז&lt;/big&gt; יכנ&lt;big&gt;ע&lt;/big&gt;  &lt;small&gt;(Lev. 26:41)&lt;/small&gt;, [and which last letters spell out] '''M'''&lt;small&gt;a&lt;/small&gt;'''wzaʻ'''! By the end of the year, the blessed God took mercy upon them and the king was appeased by agreeing to bring back the Jews, only he did not permit them to return to their former houses, but rather to build for themselves [new] houses outside of the city. And so it was.

After these things, they settled in that place wherein the king had given to them to dwell, and they built houses. Now, in those days they appointed over themselves a Prince ([[Nagid]]), even the teacher and rabbi, Yiḥya Halevi, of blessed memory.}}

==Aftermath==
[[File:Jewish children in Sana'a, Yemen, circa 1909.jpg|thumb|right|Jewish Children in the Jewish Quarter of Sana'a, 1901]]
Those Jews who survived, who returned either to Sana'a or to the other towns and villages, were mostly ill from being exposed to the changes in climate and from the poor quality of drinking water. In Sana'a, they were required to relinquish their ownership over their houses and fields within the city's wall, in the neighborhood of al-Sā'ilah, and were directed to build humble abodes in a new area outside of the city's walls, in a place then known as the "hyena's field" (Ar. ''Qāʻ al-simaʻ''), or what later became known as ''Qāʻ al-Yahud '' (the Jewish Quarter).&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," Sefunot, Volume 2, 1958, pp. 246-286 (Hebrew); Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 706 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; This place attracted other migrant Jews from the other towns and villages from which they had been expelled and soon grew into a suburb, situate about one kilometer beyond the walls which then existed on the extreme west-side of the city. The first synagogue to be built in this place was the Alsheikh synagogue, in which was housed the returnees most prized possessions: Torah scrolls and old, handwritten manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yosef Qafiḥ]], ''Halikhot Teiman'' (Jewish Life in Sana) , Ben-Zvi Institute, Jerusalem, 1982, p. 81, note 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish houses were made "low, seldom more than two storeys, and built of sun-baked brick dressed with mud."&lt;ref name="G. Wyman Bury 1915, p. 80"&gt;G. Wyman Bury, ''Arabia Infelix or the Turks in Yamen'', London 1915, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the place is called ''Qāʻ al-ʻUlufi'' (Ar. قاع العلفي).&lt;ref&gt;R. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, ''San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City''. London 1983, p. 82; R.L. Playfair, ''A History of Arabia Felix or Yemen''. Bombay 1859, p. 112; N.A. Stillman, ''The Jews of Arab Lands.'' Philadelphia 1979, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; The lands upon which they built the new Jewish Quarter were lands provided by the king, but the Jews were later required to pay a monthly tenancy fee for the land, and which money accrued to the Muslim ''[[Waqf ]]'' (mortmain land) for the upkeep of their own places of worship. Between the new Jewish Quarter and the city walls was a suburb full of gardens called ''Bi'r alʻAzab'' (the Single's Well), being once the Turkish Quarter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yosef Qafiḥ]], ''Halikhot Teiman (Jewish Life in Sana) '', Ben-Zvi Institute, Jerusalem, 1982, p. 80, note 44&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years, the Jewish Quarter was also enclosed by a wall.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Tobi, ''Studies in `Megillat Teman`'', Jerusalem 1986, p. 77 (Hebrew) {{ISBN|965-223-624-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, the Muslims passed a new edict which forbade Jews from dwelling within Muslim neighborhoods, so as not to "defile their habitations," although they were at liberty to work in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 706 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;  Those who traversed between the Jewish Quarter and the city would go by foot, while those who were either aged or ill would make use of beasts of burden to carry them into the city, the Jewish Quarter being then at a distance of about one-kilometer from the city's walls. When these who had ridden upon donkeys were spied by the gentiles, they were presently envied by the gentiles, who then went unto the king and pressed upon him to outlaw their riding upon donkeys, saying that this mode of transportation seemed to be too extravagant for the Jews and would lead to a general unrest and eventual hegemony over the indigenous people. The king then passed a series of discriminatory laws (Ar. ''ghiyār'') meant to humiliate the Jews and which not only forbade their riding upon donkeys and horses, but also from walking or passing to the right side of any Muslim. Jews were to pass only on the left side of all Muslims. They also petitioned the king that a Jew would be prohibited by an edict from raising his voice against any Muslim, but to behave in a lowly and contrite spirit, and that offenders would be made punishable by flogging.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, pp. 706-707 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;  Such were the conditions of the Jews at that time.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The Exile of Mawzaʻ brought about demographic changes that could be felt all across Yemen. In Sana'a, to distinguish the original inhabitants from incoming migrant Jews, all newcomers who chose to dwell in the newly built Jewish Quarter were given surnames, each one after the place from which he was exiled, so that a man who came from the district of Sharʻab was called so-and-so, al-Sharʻabi, or he that came from the village of Maswar was called so-and-so, al-Maswari.&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, pp. 706 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the words of the Jewish chronicler who wrote ''Dofi Hazeman'' (Vicissitudes of Time), being one of the earliest Jewish accounts of the expulsion (initially compiled by Yaḥyā ben Judah Ṣa'di in 1725) &lt;ref&gt;[[Shelomo Dov Goitein]], ''The Yemenites (History, Communal Organization, Spiritual Life)'', Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1983, p. 162 (Hebrew). David Solomon Sassoon attributes the writing to [the son of] Sa'īd, based on the author's own remark that he is "the son of ''Ḥazmaq'' the younger" (= Sa'īd, or Se'adyah), the usual rendition for this name given in the reversed order of the Hebrew alphabet. See: David Solomon Sassoon, ''Ohel Dawid'' (vol. 2), Oxford University Press: London 1932, p. 969, s.v. דופי הזמן. A microfilm copy of this work is available at the National Library of Israel in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (Givat Ram Campus), Manuscript Dept., Microfilm reel # F-9103.&lt;/ref&gt; and which work has since undergone several recensions by later chroniclers, we read the following testimony:&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ (ed.), "''Qorot Yisra'el be-Teman'' by Rabbi [[Hayyim Habshush|Ḥayim Ḥibshush]]," or what was originally entitled ''Dofi Hazeman'' (Vicissitudes of Time), Sefunot (Volume Two), 1958, pp. 246-286 (Hebrew); Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim''  (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem  1989, p. 716 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|He (i.e. the king) then commanded to give license unto the Jews to return unto the country and to build for themselves tents, although set apart from the houses of the Muslims so that they will not defile them. Those who were banished then came up from the [[Tihama]] [coastal plain], returning from [[Mawza District|Mawzaʻ]]; one man from a city and two from a family, for most of them had been consumed by the land of [[Tihama]] which dispenses of life. Neither had there remained any of them, save ten people for every hundred [who were driven out into exile], while the majority of them did not return to settle in their former place, but were scattered in all the districts of Yemen. That is, aside from the family of the Levites, most of whom returned and settled in their [former] place. Now their dwelling place was from the town of ash-Sharafah, eastward of Wadi al-Sirr, stretching as far as the town of al-'Arus which lies in the region of [[Kawkaban]], a walking distance of about one and a half days; as well as the breadth of the city of [[Sana'a|Ṣan'ā']], stretching as far as the extremity of the land of Arḥab, being also a walking distance of one and a half days. These trace their lineage to Sasson the Levite, their ancestor, seeing that there was a law for the early Jews in Yemen for each family to dwell separately; the family of priests ([[Kohen|Cohenim]]) by themselves with their burial grounds, and also the family of Levites and the Israelites, each of them dwelling by themselves in their cities and with their own burial grounds. Now, unto this day, those Levites dwell separately in those said districts, although a few Israelites have newly arrived to dwell in their midst. In every place, the gentiles have given to them a parcel of ground, on a rental basis, in order that they may construct shelters in which to live, set apart from them, seeing that their enemies had already taken [from them] their own towns and houses and vineyards and fields. Thus, they were pleased to dwell with them and to be occupied in the various fields of labour, according to their diverse skills, in order that they might find sustenance thereby for their beings: among which were those who plastered with earth, and of those who crushed limestone, and of those who were potters, and some who were wood craftsmen, and others silversmiths, while still others blacksmiths and some who were merchants; There were yet others who were couriers, some who were weavers, others tailors, and some who were knowledgeable in prophylactic matters; others who were physicians, and others who chiseled away the surface of millstones, and some of whom who were porters. Now their magnanimity did not permit them to just lay back in idleness.}}

Danish explorer, [[Carsten Niebuhr]], who visited the Jewish Quarter of Sana'a in 1763, some eighty-three years following the community's return to Sana'a, estimated their numbers at only two-thousand.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carsten Niebuhr]], ''Reisebeschreibung nach Arabien und andern umliegenden Ländern'' (''Description of Travel to Arabia and Other Neighboring Countries''), Zürich 1992, pp. 416-418 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; These had built, up until 1761, fourteen synagogues within the new Jewish Quarter. In 1902, before the famine of 1905 decimated more than half of the city's Jewish population, German explorer [[Hermann Burchardt]] estimated the Jewish population of Sana'a at somewhere between six and eight thousand.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Burchardt, ''Die Juden in Yemen'', published in: ''Ost und West'', Berlin 1902, p. 338 (German).&lt;/ref&gt; G. Wyman Bury, who visited the Jewish Quarter of Sana'a in 1905 noted a decrease in the city's population from 1891, estimated at 50,000 people (Jews and Muslims alike), to only about 20,000 people in 1905.&lt;ref name="G. Wyman Bury 1915, p. 80"/&gt; By 1934, when [[Carl Rathjens]] visited Sana'a, the Jewish population in the city had swollen to about seven thousand.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Rathjens &amp; Hermann v. Wissman, ''Landeskundliche Ergebnisse'', vol. 40, Hamburg 1934, pp. 133-134; 141 (German).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate of the Old Synagogue==
One of the outcomes of the king's notorious decree was that Jewish property passed into Muslim hands. A Jewish public bath house in Sana'a was relinquished and passed into the proprietorship of the Muslim [[Waqf]]. So, too, the once famous synagogue within Sana'a's walled city and which was known as ''Kenisat al-'Ulamā'' (The Synagogue of the Sages) was turned into a [[mosque]] and called ''Masjid al-Jalā'' – the Mosque of the Expulsion, or "of those banished." On the frieze (Ar. ''ṭiraz'') of the ''Masjid al-Jalā'' were inscribed words with invectives, in gypsum plaster (Ar. ''al-juṣ''):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our king, [[Al-Mahdi Ahmad|al-Mahdi]], is the sun of [religious] guidance / even [[al-Mahdi Ahmad|Aḥmad]], the [grand]son of him who rose to power, [[Al-Mansur al-Qasim|al-Qasim]]. Unto him is ascribed dignities, such as were not accorded / before [to any other], even in part. Had he not done aught but banish / the Jews of [[Sana'a|Ṣan'ā']], who are the 'scum' of the world, and turned their venerable place (Ar. ''bi'ah'' = synagogue) into a mosque, / for bowing down unto God or standing [before Him in prayer], by that decree, he would have still been most triumphant. Now the time of this event happened to concur with the date that is [alluded to] in ''ghānim'' [victorious]";  [[Abjad numerals#Letter values|''Ghān&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;m'']] = ({{lang-ar|'''غانم'''}}), the numerical value of which letters adds up to [[Anno Hegirae|A.H.]] 1091 = 1680 CE).&lt;ref&gt;P.S. van Koningsveld, J. Sadan &amp; Q. Al-Samarrai, ''Yemenite Authorities and Jewish Messianism'', Leiden University 1990, pp. 156-158. {{ISBN|9071220079}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rabbi [[Amram Qorah]] brings down a brief history of the said mosque, taken from a book originally drawn up in Arabic and which was entitled: ''A List of the Mosques of Ṣan'ā'''.&lt;ref&gt;Amram Qorah, ''Sa'arat Teman'' (2nd edition), Jerusalem 1988, pp. 10-11 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;  Therein is found a vivid description of the events which transpired in that fateful year and which reads as follows: "Among the mosques built in the vicinity of al-Sā'ilah, northwards from the path which leads from al-Sā'ilah to al-Quzālī, and the mosque [known as] Ben al-Ḥussein built by the Imam of the Qasimid dynasty, the son of Muhammad (i.e. al-Mahdi Ahmad b. al-Ḥasan b. [[Al-Mansur al-Qasim|al-Qasim]] b. Muhammad), in the year [[Anno Hegirae|A.H.]] 1091 (= 1679 CE) in the synagogue of the Jewish Quarter, who banished them from Sana'a and removed them unto a place befitting them, [a place] now known as ''Qāʻ al-Yahud'' on the west side of Sana'a, just as it has been intimated by the scholarly judge, Muhammad b. Ibrahim al-Suḥuli, etc." Rabbi Amram Qorah then proceeds to bring down the words or [[panegyric]] inscribed on the frieze of the mosque in rhymed verse (see: ''supra''), and which apparently had been composed by the said judge, in which he describes the exploits of the king who banished the Jews and who converted their synagogue into a mosque.&lt;ref&gt;Amram Qorah, ''Sa'arat Teman'' (1st edition), Jerusalem 1954, pp. 10-11 ([http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7292&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=23&amp;hilite= pp. 23-24] in PDF) [Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Amram Qorah, in the same work, brings down Rabbi Pinheas ben Gad Hacohen's account of events, whose testimony he found written in the margin of the first page of a Prayer Book (''Siddur''), written in 1710:&lt;ref&gt;Amram Qorah, ''Sa'arat Teman'' (2nd edition), Jerusalem 1988, pp. 9 -10 (Hebrew). Moshe Gavra brings down the same account, mentioning that Rabbi Pinheas ben Gad Hacohen of Dhamar had first written this account in a ''Siddur'' that he had written for Rabbi Yehudah Ṣa'adi in 1680. See: {{cite book | last=Gavra | first=Moshe | year=2010 | title=Meḥqarim basiddurei tayman: Studies in the Prayer Books of Yemen, vol. 1, p. 72 | place=Benei Barak | publisher=Mechon le'ḥeqer ḥakhmei tayman | language=Hebrew }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now I shall inform you, my brethren, about what has happened to us at this time, since the beginning of ''anno'' 1,990 of the [[Seleucid Era]] (1678 CE) and in 1,991 [of the same] (1679 CE), how that the king made a decree and demolished all the synagogues of all the towns of Yemen, and there were some of the books and sacred writings that were desecrated at the hand of the gentiles, on account of our great iniquities, so that we could no longer make our [public] prayers, save only a very few [men] secretly within their houses. Afterwards, the king made a decree against the Jews to expel them into the wilderness of Mawzaʻ, while they, [at this time] demolished also their houses. However, there were some who managed to sell their house; what was worth one-thousand gold pieces they sold for one-hundred, and what was worth one-hundred gold pieces they sold for ten. So that, by these things, we were for a reproach amongst the nations, who continuously sought after ways by which they might cause us to change [our religion], O may God forbid! So, all of the exiles of Israel stood up and laid aside their most beloved and precious possessions as a means by which God's name might be sanctified, blessed be He, including their fields and their vineyards, and delivered themselves up as martyrs for God's name sake, blessed be He. And if one had need of going out into the marketplace, he could not avoid being the object of hatred and spite, while there were those who even attacked him or called him by abusive language, so that there was fulfilled in this, our generation, the scripture that says, ''Who will raise up Jacob, for he is too small'' &lt;small&gt;(Amos 7: 2, 5)&lt;/small&gt; to bear all the afflictions. So, too, was there fulfilled in us by reason of our iniquities the scripture that says, ''And I shall send a faintness into their hearts'' &lt;small&gt;(Lev. 26:36)&lt;/small&gt;. Yet, the divine Name, blessed be He, gives us strength to bear all those troubles and travails each day.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Testimonies preserved in poetry==
Another man who witnessed these events, Shalem 'Ashri, also wrote a suppliant poem about the events of that year – the Exile of Mawzaʻ, now preserved in the Yemenite [[Diwan (poetry)|''Diwān'']],&lt;ref name=jerusalem1976&gt;''Sefer Hashirim Hagadol – The Large Song Book'', [[Shalom Shabazi]] (ed. Yosef Hasid), Jerusalem 1976, p. 51, s.v. אזיל דמעותי כמטר יזלו (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; which same poem is meant to be chanted as a slow dirge by one or, at the most, two individuals, who are then answered by others who sit in attendance. It is sung without the accompaniment of musical instruments, although a tin drum is sometimes used, in accordance with what is customary and proper for the ''[[nashid]]'' (a rejoinder). His own name is spelt out in acrostic form in the first letters of each stanza:&lt;ref name=jerusalem1976 /&gt;
{{hidden begin|style=border:1px solid #aaa|title={{center|Poem: "I Shall Shed My Tears"}}}}

"I shall shed my tears – like rain they shall pour down / over all the pleasant sons who have gone forth into exile.
They have forgotten what pertains to their happiness, and have also been diminished. / They journeyed in haste; along the parched ground they trod.

A multitude of the handmaid's sons&lt;ref&gt;An allusion to [[Ishmael]], the son of Hagar (handmaid of Abraham), and the progenitor of the Arab nation.&lt;/ref&gt; have ruled over them. / Wrath, and also jealousy, they've poured out upon them.

Whilst the dwelling place of God's glory, they have been given power to destroy!  
Midrash, as also the Talmud and the Torah, they have abolished. / Constable and elder were, both, drawn away by their hands.
Orion and Pleiades, as well as the crescent moon, have become dim! / Even all the luminous lights, their light has turned into darkness!
The beauty of their homes and their money they had entirely looted. / Every oppressor and every governor have prepared their bow for shooting.

The heads of their academies have borne patiently the exile, / to do even the will of God, having valued the commandments.

For the honour due to the writing of thine own hand on the day when they were gathered,&lt;ref&gt;An allusion to the tablets of the Ten Commandments, given to the people of Israel while they were gathered at Mount Sinai.&lt;/ref&gt; / may you call to remembrance and deliver them during the time of their flight.

In the following poem of the subgenre known as ''qiṣṣa'' (poetic tale), composed mostly in [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]] with only two stanzas written in Hebrew, the author gives a long testimony about the events which transpired during that year of exile. The poem is entitled, ''Waṣalnā hātif al-alḥān'' – "Tidings have reached us," and is the work of the illustrious poet, [[Shalom Shabazi]], who was an eye-witness to these events and whose name is inscribed in the poem in acrostics. The rhyme, however, has been lost in the translation:&lt;ref&gt;The English translation (in the collapsible thread) is based on the Hebrew translation of the poem made by Yehudah Ratzaby, in his article, ''Galut Mawza''', published in Sefunot, Volume 5, Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1961, pp. 353-354 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{hidden begin|style=border:1px solid #aaa|title={{center|Poem: "Tidings Have Reached Us"}}}}
"Tidings have reached us on the second day of [the lunar month] ''[[Rajab]]'' (i.e. corresponds with the 2nd day of the lunar month Elul), saying, 'My companions, arise and ascribe singularity unto the Merciful One, and read [the decree] that has been inscribed!  Hearken to these matters, and let not your mind be distracted, for the appointed time is at hand. [[Al-Mahdi Ahmad|Al-Mahdi]] the king has decreed over us that we take flight.' The Jews of [[Sana'a]] then took leave, and have wandered unto those select places,&lt;ref&gt;Lit. "...have wandered unto Khabt," perhaps being the Al-Khabt in the Abyan District, in the far south-eastern reaches of Yemen, near the Indian Ocean. Yehudah Ratzaby suggests that the sense here is the two towns, the one being called ''Khabt of Darʻān'' and the other, ''Khabt of al-Baqr''. Initially, the king had agreed that Jews be permitted to resettle in these towns, but later changed his mind. See: Yehudah Ratzaby, article: ''Galut Mawza''', published in Sefunot (Volume Five), Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1961, pp. 378-379, note *4 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; even unto the habitation of vipers and brute beasts. Even from al-Mahjam and from Dar'ān it was decreed over us to leave; by authorization of an edict which has overcome us. Now, we shall wait in Mawza'; there we shall dwell in the far reaches of the land belonging to the inhabitants of Arabia.

All of the inhabitants of 'Uzal (i.e. [[Sana'a|Ṣan'ā']])&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; were obedient, and they assembled in [[Dhamar, Yemen|Dhamar]]. My companion, tighten the camel's gear and we'll begin moving after the ass. Let us proceed to 'Adinah, then to 'Amirah, and to al-'Ammār, while there we shall make camp. As for the young ones and those who were weak, their tears flowed like riverine brooks. 'Idaynah, receive those who are beloved! Go out to the gate of the city to welcome them! Now is the hour of testing those who are friends. Let them take pleasure in the weary fugitive, so that his fatigue might depart from him. Lo! They are the sons of the tribes and of those who are pious; those who are highborn and of gentility.

''Ṣafī al-Din'' (i.e. [[Al-Mahdi Ahmad|al-Mahdi]]) has already given the order that we not remain in our places.  Whether rich man or poor man, or he that is respectable, together they have gone forth; let us proceed according to our ability, under the influences of Saturn's horoscope; its evil portent will bring destruction. If its light flickers, it is about to change. The wisdom of the Blessed God has decreed upon the Sages of Israel, even the chosen sons of Jacob. Our elder, Suleiman [al-Naqqāsh] the Helmsman, will be the judge of those attempting to bypass [his decree]. In his hand there is the Imām's order for all to see, while there is nothing disparaging about the matter.

I am curtailed of my sleep from dismay, while tears run down my cheeks. When our elder, al-Naqqāsh, had arrived, all of the Jews [who had come out to see him] were shaken-up. 'Let us go out into the barren wasteland, a place of monstrous beasts and every kind of lion. Happy is he who returns safely from that place. We have already sold our fields, have forsaken our houses, and have submitted to the decree of our lord, [the king].' The young men wept, as also the pious men, when His anger was turned against us. Consider, O Lord, and reflect upon how many distinguished men, as well as those who were delicately raised, have been humiliated!

Weep, O Rachel, in our city for [your] wandering sons! Stir up our forefathers, let them arise, standing upon their feet, so that they may make mention of our fathers who, with grace, insist upon God's unison.  May God's favour accompany us, in whose shadow we fervently desire. Let him gather those who dwell in Yemen, seeing that He is a Shepherd and the Faithful God. We shall then hear the song of the sons of Heman (i.e. the sons of Zerah, the son of Judah). Let him then take away the poison of the adder, which is most bitter. Let him command Yinnon (i.e. the Messiah) and the Prefect [of the priest] (i.e. Elijah, the forerunner of the Messiah), and let him say to him: 'Draw nigh!'

By the merit of our forefathers, by the favour [with which you have favoured] Levi who is of Jacob's seed, make level [the ground] along the route in your wilderness for the son who is, both, comely and good. And by the nut tree garden may you sedate my heart which is in pain. As for Gabriel and the rooster, I have heard them in the street, whilst my pigeon is at rest; she calls out to the poor: 'Release [them] from their bonds!' In Zion there is to be found relief, whilst our portion is in the [[Garden of Eden]], just as a son who is dearly loved. We shall then behold the house of our God, and the houses of [[Gush Halav|Gischala]] (Heb. Gush Ḥalab).

The Mashtaite&lt;ref&gt;Another appellation for Shalom Shabazi&lt;/ref&gt; has said: O God, remove mine affliction. Our strength is brought low in Yemen, in the days of my exile. In both small and great matters, I think about my case. Now, by the abundance [of afflictions] delights have been diminished. O gracious God! He who instructs my tongue to speak, Heaven forbid that you have forgotten me!  Unto Whom belong signs and wonders. Behold, it was upon us that He bestowed His bounty, and He has chosen Moses, the son of Amram, our beloved prophet!

The pampered pigeons are cooing in the tops of the citadels. The householders of al-Sā'ilah who have come to visit [[al-Mahdi Ahmad|al-Mahdi]] are complaining [before him] about how destruction and evil have come over them. They recall the conversations revolving around the Divine Law spoken [between their walls], and the vines and the flowers [in their gardens]; they recall also the social gatherings where wine was served, and the chalices, and the splendour of their wedding feasts, where [a man] would delight himself in them, become inebriated, but would avoid that which is obscene or mockery; [he'd drink] pure wine, whatever kind at hand, whose colour was as gold!

The Book of the Law (i.e. [[Torah]]) calls out to all wise men, and says: 'Have you neglected the study of the Law? It is the reason for their ignorance. Let them repent before the masters and return unto their Lord. The day of redemption is nigh, and He shall gather together their dispersed. There is a time for drinking wine, together with [eating] dainties, and there is a time for delving in wisdom. He, whose wine makes him heavy laden, let him sleep [and rest] from his weariness and from his burden. Let him wake-up to drink a second cup, such as may be imposed upon him.

In conclusion, [let us pray] that He who is congenial (i.e. God) might conceal us in the covert of His mercy. The Benevolent One shall not forget us, while we shall proclaim the eminence of His bountiful grace. He that will console us, may he be merited with a good life. He that gives to us clothing, may his own wishes be fulfilled. My salutations go out unto those of my companions on this happy, but powerful night; [which shall continue unabated] until Venus comes out [in the sky]. That which my God has decreed shall come to pass, while for every thing there is a reason. The birds will once again trill at the top of the ben [nut] tree (''Moringa peregrina'') in the fruitful orchard."

Another record of these events, composed here in poetic verse (although the rhyme has been lost in the translation), is the poem composed by Sālim ben Sa'īd, in [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]]. The poem is written as a ''nashid'' and is entitled, '''Ibda' birrub al-'arsh'' (I shall commence by addressing Him who is upon the throne).&lt;ref&gt;Yehudah Ratzaby, Sefunot (Volume Five), his article: ''Galut Mawza''', Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1961, pp. 379-380 (Translation of the original Judeo-Arabic), s.v. poem entitled: אבדע ברב אלערש; The original Judeo-Arabic was published in ''Hazofeh – Quartalis Hebraica'' (ed. Dr. L. Blau), vol. 7, Budapest 1923; (''ibid''.) Second edition, Jerusalem 1972, pp. 2–3. The original Judeo-Arabic text can also be had at the Hebrew University National Library (Givat Ram Campus), Jerusalem, Manuscript Dept., Microfilm reel # F-9103.&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{hidden begin|style=border:1px solid #aaa|title={{center|Poem: "I Shall Commence by Addressing Him who is Upon the Throne"}}}}
"I shall commence by addressing Him who is upon the throne [of glory], even He that is an Omniscient God, the Creator of all creatures; He who causes the dumb to speak.

I was curtailed of my sleep this night, while my heart was aching on account the king's decree; he that has made a decree against us by an oath.

He has revealed his ill-intentions on a dark night, one made sullen by the shadow of death; and who has sent against us soldiers and oppressors.

We lifted up our voices unto God of heaven, [saying]: 'Remove from us the evil of this decree. Behold! You are He that governs all!'

They have destroyed all of the cities, and have cast their fear upon the Sages. There is none who takes an interest in our case, nor anyone who will take pity upon us.

He lifted up his right hand and swore, 'They have no choice but to be banished unto Mawza!'

He commanded to destroy the synagogues which were in [[Sana'a]], the habitation of the Divine Law and the seating place of the Sages.

He forced (?) them to go out into a parched land, the [[Tihama]] and al-Mahjam.

They wandered unto Mawza' and walked along the paths, in the fierce blaze of heat and with severe thirst.

On the day in which he took them out of their houses, their eyes rained tears of blood. They had gone out a short distance in the dark of night.&lt;ref&gt;In accordance with a verse in Ezekiel 12:4, ''And you shall go forth at eventide in their sight, as they that go forth into exile''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several distinguished persons, and several disciples of the Sages [went forth into exile]; they and their little ones, who were without understanding.

'You are obliged to go forth into exile; `tis from the Lord of Heaven, who once delivered us from the hand of wicked Pharaoh.'

My heart moans over my relatives who are missing. I have no pleasure in sleep, nor in bread or water!

A flame burns inside of me, ever since the evil tidings [of the king's decree] reached me; I have become perplexed.

Praised be the Creator of the heavenly circuits, the Ruler of all [things], unto whom none can be compared.

Your covenant and your signs have been forever. You have intoxicated your people with the waters of Abraham, [made during] the covenant between the dissected halves.&lt;ref&gt;An allusion to Genesis 15:1-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

But now, O king of most puissant kings, your people are sadly distressed and are deprived of all things.

They (i.e. the gentiles) cast their fear upon us, while the horsemen inflict us. No one tries to help us, nor is there anyone who takes pity upon us.

They have humiliated our religion, and have called out to us to become Muslims; even to sin and to desecrate your Divine Law.

He (i.e. the Imām) has issued against us frequent declarations; shall we not fear the punishment of God on High?

Our elders have gone forth into exile by an urgent command, whether willingly or unwillingly.

I have concluded my words, my brethren! Take-up my salutations and remain silent! Our hope is in God the Omniscient.

Remember me, O God, on account of the Divine Law's hidden mystery! So, too, remember Jacob, 'the man of pure intentions' [dwelling in tents]!&lt;ref&gt;An allusion to Genesis 25:27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remember Moses who built for you the Tent of Convocation in the Sinai wilderness, on the day in which your Divine Presence dwelt thereon.

Do not forget Isaac, your bound [servant], on the day in which he spoke to Abraham face to face.

Praise be to you, O Master of the universe! `Tis from me, Sālim ben Sa'īd, who has written rhymed verse."

==Jacob Saphir's Testimony==
In 1859, Lithuanian Jew, [[Jacob Saphir]], visited the Jewish community in Yemen, less than two-hundred years after the Exile of Mawza', but still heard vivid accounts from the people about the things that befell their ancestors during that fateful event. Later, he made a written account of the same in his momentous ethnographic work, ''Iben Safir''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Saphir, ''Iben Safir'' (vol. 1 - ch. 43), Lyck 1866, pp. 100a-100b (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; The full, unabridged account is given here (translated from the original Hebrew):
{{hidden begin|style=border:1px solid #aaa|title={{center|Jacob Saphir's Testimony}}}}
"[The Jews] dwelt securely, beneath the shadow of the kings of that country, until three-hundred ([[sic]]) years ago&lt;ref&gt;Should be amended to read "approximately two-hundred years ago," i.e. 1679&lt;/ref&gt; while they were dwelling in that chief metropolis, when the daughter of the king became pregnant outside of wedlock, and they laid the blame upon a Jewish man, one of the king's courtiers and of those who behold his countenance. However, the king's wrath wasn't assuaged until he had banished all of the Jews from that city and the surrounding regions, expelling them to the region of [[Tihama]], a desolate wilderness (a walking distance of ten days' journey in a south-westerly direction from [[Sana'a]]), between [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] and [[Aden]]; a salty land, and one of very fearsome heat, while they were all tender and accustomed to delicacies. Many of them died along the way, while those who came there could not bear the climate of that place and its infirmities. Two thirds of them succumbed and perished, and they had entertained the notion that all of them would perish either by the plague, by famine or by thirst, may God forbid. &lt;small&gt;'''(Here, J. Saphir brings down a poem written about the event by Rabbi [[Shalom Shabazi]], and which has already been quoted above)'''&lt;/small&gt; Now during the time of this exile and perdition, they had lost all of their precious belongings, and their handwritten books, as well as their peculiar compositions which they possessed of old. I have also seen their synagogues and places of study used by them of old in the city of the gentiles; eternal desolations 'and where demons will be found making sport' &lt;small&gt;(Isa. 13:21)&lt;/small&gt;, on account of our great iniquities. Notwithstanding, it is by the mercies of the Lord that we have not perished. He (i.e. God) did not prolong the days of their exile, but sent great distempers upon the king and upon his household. (They say that this was on account of the virtue of that pious Rabbi, the [[kabbalist]], even our teacher and Rabbi, Mori [[Shalom Shabazi|Sālim al-Shabazi]], may the memory of the righteous be blessed, who brought about multiple forms of distempers upon that cruel king, who then regretted the evil [that he caused them] and sent [messengers] to call out unto them [with] a conciliatory message, [requesting] that they return to their place – with the one exception that they not dwell with them in the royal city built as a fortress. He then gave to them a possession, being a grand inheritance outside of the city, which is ''al-Qaʻa'', ''B'ir al-ʻAzāb'' – the plain wherein is the cistern known as ''ʻAzāb'', and they built there houses for their dwelling quarters and built for themselves an enclosing wall which extended as far as to the wall of the city built like unto a fortress. In only a short time God assisted them, and they built there a large city and one that was spacious. They also acquired wealth and they rose to prominence, while many of the villagers likewise seized [upon land] with them, that they might dwell in the city, until it became [a place] full of people. At that time, Mori Yiḥya Halevi was the ''Nasi'' among them and the Exilarch.)"

== References to [[Sana'a]] before the expulsion==
There are several references to Jewish life in Sana'a before the expulsion of 1679. [[Yihya Saleh|Maharitz]] (d. 1805) mentions in his Responsa&lt;ref name=jerusalem1979b&gt;''Questions &amp; Responsa Pe'ulath Ṣadiq'', [[Yihya Saleh]], vol. III, ''responsum'' # 252, Jerusalem 1979, p. 153 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; that before the Exile of Mawza the Jews of Sana'a had an old custom to say the [[Sheva Brachot|seven benedictions]] for the bridegroom and bride on a Friday morning, following the couple's wedding the day before. On Friday (Sabbath eve) they would pitch a large tent within a garden called ''al-Jowzah'', replete with pillows and cushions, and there, on the next day (Sabbath afternoon), the invited guests would repeat the seven benedictions for the bridegroom and bride, followed by prayer inside the tent, before being dismissed to eat of their third Sabbath meal, at which time some accompanied the bridegroom to his own house to eat with him there. The significance of this practice, according to Maharitz, was that they made the seven blessings even when not actually eating in that place, a practice which differs from today's custom.&lt;ref name=jerusalem1979b /&gt;

German-Jewish ethnographer, [[Shelomo Dov Goitein]], mentions a historical note about the old synagogue in Sana'a, before the expulsion of Jews from the city in 1679, and which is written in the glosses of an old copy of the [[Mishnah]] (''[[Seder Moed]]''), written with Babylonian [[Yemenite Hebrew#History|supralinear punctuation]].&lt;ref name=holon1975&gt;''The Mishnah: Order Mo'ed - A Yemenite Manuscript '', ed. Yehudah Levi Nahum, Introduction, Ḥolon 1975, p. 18 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; The marginal note concerns the accurate pronunciation of the word אישות in Mishnah ''Mo'ed Ḳaṭan'' 1:4, and reads as follows: "Now the Jews of Sana'a read it as אִישׁוּת (''ishūth''), with a [vowel] ''[[Kubutz and Shuruk|shuraq]]'' (''shuruk''). I studied with them a long time ago, during the time when the synagogue of Sana'a was still standing ''[[in situ]]''."&lt;ref name=holon1975 /&gt;

==Enactments in wake of exile (1680–1690)==
Upon returning to Sana'a, the Chief Rabbis, led by R. Shelomo Manzeli and Yiḥya Halevi (called ''Alsheikh''), came together in the newly built Alsheikh synagogue and decided to put in place a series of enactments meant at bettering the spiritual condition of the community, and which they hoped would prevent the recurrence of such harsh decrees against the Jewish community in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Gavra, ''Meḥqarim basiddurei tayman: Studies in the Prayer Books of Yemen'', vol. 1, Benei Barak 2010, pp. 70 – 71; ibid. vol. 4, pp. 156 – 159 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;  These enactments were transcribed in a document entitled ''Iggereth Ha-Besoroth'' (Letter of Tidings), and which was believed to have been disseminated amongst the community at large. Only excerpts of the letter have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Yosef Subeiri, ''Siddur Kenesseth Ha-Gedolah'', vol. 3, Tel-Aviv/Jaffa 1976 – 1992, p. 297 (Hebrew); Rabbi Yihya Saleh, Questions &amp; Responsa ''Pe'ulath Ṣadiq'', vol. III, ''responsum'' # 252, Jerusalem 1979, p. 153 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; The enactments called out for a more strict observance of certain laws which, heretofore, had been observed with leniency. Such strictures were to be incumbent upon the entire community and which, in the Rabbis' estimation, would have given to the community some merit in the face of oppression or persecution.  Not all of these enactments, however, were upheld by the community, since some enactments were seen as breaking-away from tradition.&lt;ref&gt;One of the enactments called out for making one-hundred blasts of the horn on the Jewish New Year ([[Rosh Hashanah]]), based on a teaching found in Rabbi [[Nathan ben Jehiel]]'s [[Sefer Ha-Arukh]], s.v. ערב, instead of the traditional forty blasts which had been observed earlier. Another enactment sought to make it a standard procedure during the [[Mussaf]]-prayer of [[Rosh Hashanah]] to make two prayers: the first, by the congregation praying silently, followed by a repetition of the prayer said aloud by the ''Shaliach Tzibbur'' (Prayer precentor).  Maharitz would later adamantly oppose the enactment, since it sought to cancel the ancient tradition in Yemen in this regard in which it had always been a practice to make only one [[Mussaf]]-prayer. Another enactment concerned the seven benedictions mentioned by Rabbi Yosef Karo in his ''Shulḥan Arukh'' (''Even Haʻezer'' 62:10), where he brings down a certain opinion which states that is not permissible for the groom and bride to be entertained in another person's house other than in his own house during the seven days of wedding festivities, unless he and his bride were to leave their own house or town for an extended period of time, in which case it is then permissible. The enactment is mentioned with regard to ''Iggereth Ha-Besoroth'' in [[Yihya Saleh|Maharitz]]'s Questions &amp; Responsa, ''Pe'ulath Sadiq'', vol. III, ''responsum'' # 252, although the enactment seemed to have been rejected by Maharitz, in favour of Israel's older practice in Yemen. Rabbi Shalom Yitzhaq Halevi informs us that the Yemenite custom in his day was as that taught by Maharitz, and rectifies the discrepancy between the ''Shulḥan Arukh'' and the Yemenite Jewish custom by writing in the glosses of his 1894 edition of the ''Tiklāl Etz Ḥayim'' that the ''Shulḥan Arukh'' (ibid.) refers merely to when the groom and bride are invited to make the "seven benedictions" in another house where, during the seven days of feasting, a supper had been made on behalf of a circumcision, or some other ceremonial meal other than what was specifically made on the groom's behalf, in which it is not permitted to say for them the "seven benedictions." See also Rabbi Ḥayim Kessar's Questions &amp; Responsa ''Haḥayim wehashalom'' (Even Haʻezer, ''responsum'' # 10), who cites from Rabbi Yihya Hacohen's Responsa, ''Ḥayei Shalom'' (''responsum'' # 2), where he says that after the wedding, it was never a custom in Yemen that a man's bride accompanied him when he was invited to eat in the home of others. He reasons that, since she is not with him, they should not say the seven benedictions for the bridegroom alone.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Poor little birdie teased by Richard Doyle.jpg|thumb|''Poor little birdie teased'', by the 19th-century [[England|English]] illustrator [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]]. Traditional English fairytales depicting [[elves]], [[fairy|fairies]] and [[pixie]]s are set on a "Merrie England" setting of woodland and cottage gardens.]]

"'''Merry England'''", or in more jocular, archaic spelling "'''Merrie England'''" (also styled as "'''Merrie Olde England'''"), refers to an [[England|English]] [[autostereotype]], a [[utopia]]n conception of [[English culture|English society and culture]] based on an [[idyll]]ic [[pastoral]] way of life that was allegedly prevalent in [[Early Modern Britain]] at some time between the [[Middle Ages]] and the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. More broadly, it connotes a putative [[essentialism|essential]] [[Englishness]] with nostalgic overtones, incorporating such [[cultural icon|cultural symbols]] as the [[thatched cottage]], the [[country inn]] and the [[Sunday roast]].

"Merry England" is not a wholly consistent vision but rather a revisited England which [[Oxford]] [[Folkloristics|folklorist]] Roy Judge described as "a world that has never actually existed, a visionary, mythical landscape, where it is difficult to take normal historical bearings."&lt;ref&gt;Roy Judge, "May Day and Merrie England" ''Folklore'' '''102'''.2 (1991, pp. 131-148) p 131.&lt;/ref&gt;  It may be treated both as a product of the sentimental [[nostalgic]] imagination and as an ideological or political construct, often underwriting various sorts of [[Conservatism|conservative]] world-views. Favourable perceptions of Merry England reveal a nostalgia for aspects of an earlier society that are missing in modern times.

==Medieval origins==

The concept of ''Merry England'' originated in the Middle Ages, when [[Henry of Huntingdon]] around 1150 first coined the phrase ''Anglia plena jocis''.&lt;ref&gt;G. C. Coulton, ''Medieval Panorama'' (Cambridge 1938) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; His theme was taken up in the following century by the encyclopedist [[Bartholomeus Anglicus]], who claimed that "England is full of mirth and of game, and men oft-times able to mirth and game".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in G. C. Coulton, ''Medieval Panorama'' (Cambridge 1938) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

However [[Ronald Hutton]]'s study of churchwardens' accounts&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, ''The Rise and Fall of Merrie England: The Ritual Year, 1400-1700''.&lt;/ref&gt; places the real consolidation of "Merry England" in the years between 1350 and 1520, with the newly elaborative annual festive round of the liturgical year, with candles and pageants, processions and games, [[boy bishop]]s and decorated [[rood loft]]s. Hutton argued that, far from being [[Paganism|pagan survivals]], many of the activities of popular piety criticised by sixteenth-century reformers were actually creations of the later Middle Ages: "Merry England" thus reflects those historical aspects of rural English customs and folklore that were subsequently lost.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Hodgkinson, ''[[The Guardian]]'', [https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2006/nov/17/merryenglandwasrealenough 17 November 2006] - "Hutton's work confirms my belief that Britain was a merrier place before the Puritans came along with their black hats and hatred of fun. Merry England was not a myth. They really did used to dance around the maypole, feast all day and drink beer all night. And not only was it more merry, the merry-making was actually encouraged by the Church, particularly in the later medieval period. This was because the Church had realised that merry-making could be a source of funds - the profits of the bar went to church upkeep - and also because it helped bind communities."&lt;/ref&gt;  

The same concept ''may'' have also been used to describe a [[utopia]]n state of life that peasants aspired to lead (see [[Cockaigne]]).{{citeneeded|date=April 2017}} Peasant revolts, such as those led by [[Wat Tyler]] and [[Jack Straw (rebel leader)|Jack Straw]] invoked a [[visionary]] idea that was also [[egalitarian]] – [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]] arguing for "wines, spices, and good bread...velvet and camlet furred with grise"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. B. Bury ed, ''The Cambridge Medieval History Vol VII'' (Cambridge 1932) p. 739&lt;/ref&gt; all to be held in common. Tyler's rebels wished to throw off the feudal aristocracy (though the term "[[Norman yoke]]" belongs to a later period) and return to a perceived time where the Saxons ruled in equality and freedom.  The main arguments of Tyler's rebels were that there was no basis for aristocratic rule in the Bible, and that the plague had demonstrated by its indiscriminate nature that all people were equal under God. 

Even in relatively peaceful times, medieval existence was for the majority a harsh and uncertain one – [[Lawrence Stone]] describing rural life as “at the mercy of disease and the weather...with money to burn today from the sale of a bumper crop, plunged into debt tomorrow because of harvest failure”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. H. Hexter, ''On Historians'' (London 1979) p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the rural community was clearly prepared to play hard, as well as work hard (even if much of the surviving evidence for this comes in the form of official censure, ecclesiastical or secular). The festival calendar provided some fifty holy days for seasonal and communal coming-together and merry-making.&lt;ref&gt;E. Duffy, ''Th stripping of the Altars'' (London 1992) p. 42;L. Marcus, ''The Politic of Mirth'' (London 1989) p. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;  Complaints against the rise in levels of drunkenness and crime on holidays, of flirting in church or on pilgrimage, of grievous bodily harm from the “abominable enough...foot-ball-game”&lt;ref&gt;G. C. Coulton, ''Medieval Panorama'' (Cambridge 1938) p. 95, p. 192 and p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; all testify (however indirectly) to a vital, if unofficial medieval existence. [[William Langland|Langland]] might castigate, but also provided a vivid picture of, those who “drink all day in diverse taverns, and gossip and joke there”, of the field-workers who “sat down to drink their ale and sing songs – thinking to plough his field with a ''Hey-nonny-nonny''”.&lt;ref&gt;J. F Goodridge ed., ''Piers the Ploughman'' (Penguin 1966) p. 41 and p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; The wandering scholar, or [[goliard]], who posed the mock questions of whether it was better to eat meat or fish, to court Agnes or Rose,&lt;ref&gt;H. Waddell, ''The Wandering Scholars'' (Fontana 1968) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; belonged to a similar fraternity.

More legitimised recreation came in the form of archery, ice-skating, wrestling, hunting and hawking,&lt;ref&gt;D. Baker ed., ''The Early Middle Ages'' (London 1966) p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; while there was also the medieval angler, who “atte the leest hath his holsom walke and mery at his ease”.&lt;ref&gt;Juliana Berners, quoted in G. C. Coulton, ''Medieval Panorama'' (Cambridge 1938) p. 596&lt;/ref&gt; Above the town or village itself stood a semi-approved of layer of nomadic entertainers – minstrels, jugglers, [[mummers]], morris-dancers, actors and jig-makers,&lt;ref&gt;S Greenblatt, ''Will in the World'' (London 2005) pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; all adding to first stirrings of mass entertainment.

Thus there was certainly ''merriment'' in Medieval England, even if always found in an unidealized and conflictual social setting. If there was a period after the [[Black Death]] when labour shortages meant that agricultural workers were in stronger positions, and [[serfdom]] was consequently eroded, the growing commercialisation of agriculture – with enclosures, rising rents, and pasture displacing arable, sheep men – meant that such social and economic hardship and conflict continued in the countryside through into Tudor times.&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Trevelyan, ''History of England'' (London 1926) pp. 242, 283&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Reformation conflicts==

The [[English Reformation|Reformation]] set in motion a debate about popular festivities that was to endure for at least a century and a half – a culture war concerning the so-called politics of mirth.&lt;ref&gt;L. Marcus, ''The Politics of Mirth'' (London 1989) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the move away from Catholicism, Henry VIII had slashed the number of saint day holidays, attacking the "lycencyous vacacyon and lybertye of these holy days",&lt;ref&gt;E. Duffy, ''The Stripping of the Alatars'' (London 1992) p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; and Edward VI had reduced them further to a bare twenty-seven.&lt;ref&gt;J. Shapiro, ''1599'' (London 2005) p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; The annual festal round in parish society – consolidated between 1350 and 1520&lt;ref&gt;R. Hutton, ''The Rise and Fall of Merry England: The Ritual Year, 1400–1700'' (Oxford 1994) Ch II. For methodological criticism, see however Katherine L. French, ''The Sixteenth Century Journal'' (1995), 247-248&lt;/ref&gt; and including such customs as [[Parish ale|church ales]], may games, maypoles and local plays, came under severe pressure in Elizabeth's reign.&lt;ref&gt;R. Hutton, ''The Rise and Fall of Merry England: The Ritual Year, 1400-1700'' (Oxford 1994) p. 118-122&lt;/ref&gt;  Religious austerity, opposed to catholic and pagan hangovers, and economic arguments against idleness, found common ground in attacking communal celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;G. Semenza, ''Sport, Politics, and Literature in the English Renaissance'' (2003) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

However a reaction quickly set in, [[John Caius]] in 1552 deploring the loss of what he called "the old world, when this country was called merry England".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in R. Hutton, ''The Rise and Fall of Merry England: The Ritual Year, 1400-1700'' (Oxford 1994) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; James I in 1618 issued his [[Book of Sports]], specifically defending the practice of sports, dancing, maypoles and the like after Sunday Service;&lt;ref&gt;L. Marcus, ''The Politics of Mirth'' (London 1989) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and his son Charles took a similar line. The question of "Merry England" thus became a focal point dividing Puritan and Anglican, proto-Royalist and proto-Roundhead, in the lead-up to the Civil War.  Unsurprisingly, the [[Long Parliament]] put an end to ales, the last of which was held in 1641, and drove [[Christmas]] underground, where it was kept privately, as a form of protest; while the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] saw the revival of such pastimes (if not on the Sabbath itself) widely and popularly celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;G. Semenza, ''Sport, Politics, and Literature in the English Renaissance'' (2003) p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural revivals==
[[File:William Hogarth - O the Roast Beef of Old England ('The Gate of Calais') - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Gate of Calais|O the Roast Beef of Old England (The Gate of Calais)]]'' by [[William Hogarth]] contrasts English plenty with French and Jacobite Highlander misery.]]

At various times since the Middle Ages, authors, propagandists, romanticists, poets and others have revived or co-opted the term. The celebrated [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]] engraving illustrating the patriotic song "[[The Roast Beef of Old England]]" (''see illustration''), is as anti-French as it is patriotic.

[[William Hazlitt]]'s essay "Merry England", appended to his ''Lectures on the English Comic Writers'' (1819),&lt;ref&gt;It was often reprinted in collections of Hazlitt's essays, and, tellingly, included in Ernest Rhys' compilation of sentimental patriotism ''The Old Country: a Book of  Love and Praise of England'', first published in  1917, as the First World War was coming to an end, and republished in 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; popularised the specific term, introduced in tandem with an [[allusion]] to the iconic figure of [[Robin Hood]], under the [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] "St George for merry England!":
&lt;blockquote&gt;The beams of the morning sun shining on the lonely glades, or through the idle branches of the tangled forest, the leisure, the freedom, 'the pleasure of going and coming without knowing where', the troops of wild deer, the sports of the chase, and other rustic gambols, were sufficient to justify the appelation of [[Sherwood Forest|'Merry Sherwood']], and in like manner, we may apply the phrase to ''Merry England''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hazlitt's subject was the traditional sports and rural diversions native to the English. In ''Die Lage der arbeitenden Klasse in England'' (1844: translated as ''The Condition of the Working Class in England''), [[Friedrich Engels]] wrote sarcastically of [[Young England]] (a ginger-group of young aristocrats hostile to the new industrial order) that they hoped to restore "the old 'merry England' with its brilliant features and its romantic feudalism. This object is of course unattainable and ridiculous ..."  The phrase "merry England" appears in English in the German text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlwerke.de/me/me02/me02_486.htm|title=Friedrich Engels - Lage der arbeitenden Klasse in England - Die Stellung der Bourgeoisie zum Proletariat|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:CRANE a garland for mayday 1895.jpg|thumb|left|"A Garland for May Day 1895" woodcut by [[Walter Crane]]]]

[[William Cobbett]] provided conservative commentary on the rapidly changing look and ''mores'' of an industrialising nation&lt;ref&gt;William Sambrook, ''William Cobbett'' (1973), ch. I "Merry England?"&lt;/ref&gt; by invoking the stable social hierarchy and prosperous working class of the pre-industrial country of his youth in his ''[[Rural Rides]]'' (1822–26, collected in book form, 1830). The later works of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] also subscribed to some extent to the "Merry England" view. [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s ''[[Past and Present (book)|Past and Present]]'' also made the case for Merrie England; the conclusion of ''[[Crotchet Castle]]'' by [[Thomas Love Peacock]]  contrasts the mediaevalism of Mr. Chainmail to the contemporary social  unrest. Barry Cornwall's patriotic poem. "Hurrah for Merry England", was set twice to music and printed in ''[[The Musical Times]]'', in 1861 and 1880.

In the 1830s, the [[Gothic revival]] promoted in England what once had been a truly international European style. Its stages, though, had been given purely English antiquarian labels—"Norman" for the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], "[[Early English Period|Early English]]", etc.—and the revival was stretched to include also the succeeding, more specifically ''English'' style: a generic English Renaissance revival, later named "[[Jacobethan]]". The revival was spurred by a series of lithographs by [[Joseph Nash]] (1839–1849), illustrating ''The Mansions of England in the Olden Time'' in picturesque and accurate detail. They were peopled with jolly figures in ruffs and [[farthingale]]s, who personified a specific "Merry England" that was not Catholic (always an issue with the Gothic style in England), yet full of lively detail, in a golden pre-industrial land of Cockaigne.

Children's storybooks and [[fairytales]] written in the [[Victorian period]] often used Merry England as a setting as it is seen as a mythical utopia. They often contain nature-loving mythological creatures such as [[elves]] and [[fairy|fairies]], as well as [[Robin Hood]]. In popular culture, the adjective ''Dickensian'' is sometimes used in reference to the same mythical era, but [[Charles Dickens]]'s view of the rural past evoked [[nostalgia]], not [[fantasy]]. [[Samuel Pickwick|Mr. Pickwick]]'s world was that of the 1820s and 1830s, of the [[stagecoach]] before the advent of the [[railway]]s.

The London-based [[Anglo-Catholic]] magazine of prose and verse ''Merry England'' began publication in 1879. Its issues bore a sonnet by [[William Wordsworth]] as epigraph, beginning "They called thee 'merry England' in old time" and characterizing ''Merry England'' "a responsive chime to the heart's fond belief":
&lt;poem&gt;
'''...Can, I ask,'''
    This face of rural beauty be a mask
    For discontent, and poverty, and crime?—
    These spreading towns a cloak for lawless will?—
    Forbid it, Heaven! —that Merry England still
    May be they rightful name, in prose or rhyme.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In the late Victorian era, the Tory [[Young England]] set perhaps best reflected the vision of "Merry England" on the political stage. Today, in a form adapted to [[political conservatism]], the vision of "Merry England" extends to embrace a few urban artisans and other cosmopolitans; a flexible and humane [[clergy]]; an interested and [[altruism|altruistic]] [[Squire#Present status (England)|squirearchy]], [[aristocracy]] and [[royal family|royalty]]. Solidity and good cheer would be the values of [[yeoman farmer]]s, whatever the foibles of those higher in the hierarchy.

The idea of Merry England became associated on one side with the [[Anglo-Catholic]]s and [[Catholicism]], as a version of life's generosity; for example [[Alice Meynell|Wilfrid Meynell]] entitled one of his magazines ''Merrie England''. The pastoral aspects of [[William Blake]], a Londoner and an actual craftsman, lack the same mellow quality. [[G. K. Chesterton]] in part adapted it to urban conditions. [[William Morris]] and the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] and other left-inclined improvers. [[Walter Crane]]'s "Garland for May Day 1895"  is lettered "Merrie England" together with progressive slogans ("Shorten Working Day &amp; Lengthen Life", "The Land for the People", "No Child Toilers") with socialism ("Production for Use Not for Profit"). For a time, the ''Merry England'' vision was a common reference point for rhetorical [[Tories]] and utopian [[socialist]]s, offering similar alternatives to an industrialising society, with its large-scale movement off the land to jerry-built cities and gross [[social inequality]].
This was also the theme of the journalist Robert Blatchford, editor of the ''Clarion'', in his booklet ''Merrie England'' (1893) In it he imagined a new society much on the basis of William News from Nowhere, in which capitalism had disappeared and people lived in a small self sufficient communities. The book was deeply nostalgic for a pastoral England of the past before industrial capitalism and factory production. It was widely and enjoyed worldwide sales, and probably {{what?|date=November 2018}} more working class readers to socialism than William Morris or Karl Marx. 

Another variant of ''Merry England'' was promoted in the ''organic community'' of [[F. R. Leavis]] by which he seems to have meant a community with a deeply rooted and locally self-sufficient culture that he claimed existed in the villages of 17th and 18th century England and which was destroyed by the machine and mass culture introduced by the [[industrial revolution]]. Historians of the era say that the idea was based on a misreading of history and that such communities had never existed.&lt;ref&gt;Bilan R. R. (1979) ''The Literary Criticism if F. R. Leavis'' (Cambridge University Press) pages 14–18, {{ISBN|978-0-521-22324-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']] in 1951 mocked both planning, and the concept of a revived Merry England, by envisioning a 'Merrie Board' with powers to set up 'Merrie Areas' in rural England – intended to preserve "this hard core of Merriment".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in D. Matless, ''Landscape and Englishness'' (London 2016) p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Wartime propaganda is sometimes taken to reflect a generalised view of a rural Deep England, but this is perhaps to ignore both the competing views of ruralism, and the mix of rural and non-rural actually offered for a post-war vision of a better Britain.&lt;ref&gt;D. Matless, ''Landscape and Englishness'' (London 2016) p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Little England'' and propaganda==

In Angus Calder's re-examination of the ideological constructs surrounding "[[Little Englander|Little England]]" during the [[Second World War]] in ''The Myth of the Blitz'', he puts forward the view that the story of Deep England was central to wartime [[propaganda]] operations within the [[United Kingdom]], and then, as now, served a clearly defined political and cultural purpose in the hands of various interested agencies.

Calder cites the writer and broadcaster [[J. B. Priestley]] whom he considered to be a proponent of the Deep England world-view. Priestley's wartime [[BBC]] radio "chats" described the beauty of the English natural environment, this at a time when rationing was at its height, and the population of London was sheltering from the [[The Blitz|Blitz]] in its [[London Underground|Underground]] stations. In reference to one of Priestley's bucolic broadcasts, Calder made the following point:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Priestley, the socialist, gives this cottage no occupant, nor does he wonder about the size of the occupant's wage, nor ask if the cottage has internal sanitation and running water. His countryside only exists as spectacle, for the delectation of people with motor cars." (Angus Calder, ''The Myth of the Blitz'', London 1991)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in ''Journey Through England'', Priestley identified himself as a [[Little Englander]] because he despised imperialism and the effect that the capitalist industrial revolution had on the people and environment.

Part of the imagery of the 1940 patriotic song "[[There'll Always Be an England]]" seems to be derived from the same source:

:There'll always be an England
:While there's a country lane,
:Wherever there's a cottage small
:Beside a field of grain.

The continuation evokes, however, the opposite image of the modern industrialised society:

:There'll always be an England
:While there's a busy street,
:Wherever there's a turning wheel,
:A million marching feet.

The song seems therefore to offer a synthesis and combine the two Englands, the archaic bucolic one and the modern industrialised one, in the focus of patriotic loyalty and veneration.

Some of the nostalgia associated with Merry England is reminiscent, both in its origins and its artistic influences, of the 19th-Century [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic Nationalism]] which flourished in continental Europe and became integral to Nazi ideology.  However, the Merry England vision never motivated hostility towards foreigners, nor nationalism, as did Romantic Nationalism before and during the German Nazi era.

==Literature and the arts==

The transition from a literary locus of ''Merry England'' to a more obviously political one cannot be placed before 1945, as the cited example of J. B. Priestley shows. Writers and artists described as having a Merry England viewpoint range from the radical visionary poet [[William Blake]] to the evangelical Christian [[Arthur Mee]]. The [[Rudyard Kipling]] of ''[[Puck of Pook's Hill]]'' is certainly one; when he wrote it, he was in transition towards his later, very conservative stance. Within art, the fabled long-lost merrie England was also a recurring theme in the Victorian-era paintings of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]. The 1890 [[News from Nowhere]] by [[William Morris]] portrays a future England that has reverted to a rural idyll following a [[socialism|socialist]] revolution.

Reference points might be taken as children's writer [[Beatrix Potter]], [[John Betjeman]] (more interested in [[Victoriana]]), and the [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]] author [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], whose [[hobbit]] characters' culture in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|The Shire]] embodied many aspects of the Merry England point of view.

In his essay "[[Epic Pooh]]", [[Michael Moorcock]] opined:

{{quote|The little hills and woods of that [[Surrey]] of the mind, [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], are 'safe', but the wild landscapes everywhere beyond the Shire are 'dangerous'. Experience of life itself is dangerous. The ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' is a pernicious confirmation of the values of a declining nation with a [[morally bankrupt]] class whose cowardly self-protection is primarily responsible for the problems England answered with the ruthless logic of [[Thatcherism]]. Humanity was derided and marginalised. Sentimentality became the acceptable substitute. So few people seem to be able to tell the difference.}}

Here the shift has taken place: Tolkien was profoundly conservative with respect to cultural traditions, as Moorcock is quite aware, but not at all an imperialist. He set an area based upon the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] region within [[Middle-earth]], but made it apparent that its perimeter was maintained by external allies. The Shire seems to represent the comfort of childhood which Tolkien's characters must leave in order to grow into maturity and wisdom. In addition, in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', both [[Gandalf]] and Frodo express frustration with hobbits' staidness and dislike of anything foreign or out of the ordinary, and even in ''Concerning Hobbits'' the narrator shows a certain degree of impatience with hobbits' general narrow-mindedness.  Rather than a celebration of a narrow, anachronistic idealism, Tolkien's works hinge upon his characters moving beyond that place of idealism into a broader, more complex interaction with the world.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Furthermore, in the chapters "Homeward Bound" and "The Scouring of the Shire" of Tolkien's "The Return of the King" the Shire is depicted as being far from idyllic or safe, largely due to the actions of lax, greedy, and venal hobbits, with the character of Sam Gamgee describing the Shire upon his homecoming as "This is worse than Mordor." Of particular note with respect to the naturally corrupt nature of hobbits is the final chapter of The Hobbit, where "The legal bother, indeed, lasted for years. It was quite a long time before Mr Baggins was admitted to be alive again. The people who had got specially good bargains at the sale took a deal of convincing; and in the end to save time Bilbo had to buy back quite a lot of his own furniture."

''[[The Pyrates]]'', the 1983 spoof historical novel by [[George MacDonald Fraser]], sets its scene with a page-long sentence composed entirely of (immediately demolished) Merry England [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]]:
{{quote|It began in the old and golden days of England, in a time when all the hedgerows were green and the roads dusty, when hawthorn and wild roses bloomed, when big-bellied landlords brewed October ale at a penny a pint ...}}

The novel ''[[England, England]]'' by [[Julian Barnes]] describes an imaginary, though plausible, set of circumstances that cause modern England to return to the state of Deep England.  The author's views are not made explicit, but the characters who choose to remain in the changed nation are treated more sympathetically than those who leave.

In [[Kingsley Amis]]'s novel ''[[Lucky Jim]]'', Professor Welch and his friends are devotees of the Merry England legend, and Jim's "Merrie England" lecture somehow turns into a debunking of the whole concept (a position almost certainly reflecting that of Amis).

A few popular music artists have used elements of the Merry England story as recurring themes; [[The Kinks]] and their leader [[Ray Davies]] crafted ''[[The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society]]'' as a homage to English country life and culture: it was described by [[AllMusic]] senior editor [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] as an album "lamenting the passing of old-fashioned English traditions";&lt;ref name="Allmusic"&gt;Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r11011|pure_url=yes}} ''The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society'']. Allmusic.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)]]'' also contains similar elements. [[Ian Anderson (musician)|Ian Anderson]] of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] has often alluded to an anti-modern, pre-industrial, agrarian vision of England in his songs ([[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|the band's namesake]] was himself an agrarian, the inventor of the seed drill).

''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'' is a [[comic opera]] by [[Edward German]].

[[Richmal Crompton]]'s "William the Bad'" [1930] contains a chapter, 'The Pennymans Hand On The Torch',  about an idealist couple who wish to return to Merrie England, as a staging post towards their ideal of living at "the morning of the world", which means dressing in flowing robes and (incongrously with the Merrie England concept, bearing in mind the traditions of English Ale and The Roast Beef Of Old England) being vegetarian and teetotal.  The pageant they organise becomes a fiasco, largely, needless to say,  on account of William's involvement as part of the dragon who fights Mr Pennyman's St George. "The Pennymans'... pageant for May Day which involves [[St. George and the Dragon]] ... proves to be the first time ever that the Dragon (played by William) ever came out on top in the conflict".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justwilliamnotes.blogspot.co.uk/|title=Just William|author=Pip|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mindfulness and technology''' is a movement in research and design, that encourages the user to become aware of the present moment, rather than losing oneself in a technological device. This field encompasses multidisciplinary participation between design, psychology, computer science, and religion. [[Mindfulness]] stems from Buddhist [[meditation]] practices and refers to the awareness that arises through paying attention on purpose in the present moment, and non-judgmentally. In the field of [[Human–computer interaction|Human-Computer Interaction]], research is being done on ''Techno-spirituality'' — the study of how technology can facilitate feelings of awe, wonder, transcendence, and mindfulness &lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Elizabeth A.

The excessive use of personal devices, such as smartphones and laptops, can lead to the deterioration of mental and physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Extreme Mediation: Observing Mental and Physical Health in Everyday Life|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2638728.2638741|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the 2014 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing: Adjunct Publication|date = 2014-01-01|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 978-1-4503-3047-3|pages = 47–50|series = UbiComp '14 Adjunct|doi = 10.1145/2638728.2638741|first = Anthony|last = Faiola|first2 = Preethi|last2 = Srinivas}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area focuses on redesigning and creating technology to improve the wellbeing of its users.

== Mindfulness Theory ==
In 1979, [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] founded the [[Mindfulness-based stress reduction|Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction]] (MBSR) program at the University of Massachusetts to treat the chronically ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stress Reduction|url = http://www.umassmed.edu/cfm/stress-reduction/|website = University of Massachusetts Medical School|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is noted to be responsible for the popularization of mindfulness in Western culture. The program uses combination of mindfulness meditation, body awareness, and [[yoga]]. These practices were derived from teachings of the [[Eastern world|Eastern World]], specifically Buddhist traditions. Researchers found that enhanced mindfulness through the program mediated the association between increased daily spiritual experiences and improved mental health-related quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Changes in spirituality partly explain health-related quality of life outcomes after Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction|journal = Journal of behavioral medicine|date = 2011-12-01|issn = 0160-7715|pmc = 3151546|pmid = 21360283|pages = 508–518|volume = 34|issue = 6|doi = 10.1007/s10865-011-9332-x|first = Jeffrey M.|last = Greeson|first2 = Daniel M.|last2 = Webber|first3 = Moria J.|last3 = Smoski|first4 = Jeffrey G.|last4 = Brantley|first5 = Andrew G.|last5 = Ekblad|first6 = Edward C.|last6 = Suarez|first7 = Ruth Quillian|last7 = Wolever}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

===Software===
There are applications for desktop and mobile to help users bring themselves back to the present moment.

====Mindfulness Bell====
According to Vietnamese Zen teacher [[Thích Nhất Hạnh|Thich Nhat Hanh]], the ringing of a bell every 15 minutes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mindfulness Software {{!}} Plum Village|url = http://plumvillage.org/mindfulness-practice/mindfulness-software/|website = plumvillage.org|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an effective way to cultivate the mindfulness practice and connect back with the body. The Mindfulness Bell and Mindful Mynah applications simulate the bell on the user's personal device.

====Meditation====

A 2011 brain imaging study published in the ''Journal of Neuroscience'' found that even very brief instruction in mindfulness meditation (four 20-minute sessions) was effective in relieving pain by reducing the brain's emotional response to painful stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 8 Best Meditation Apps For Unwinding -- On The Go!|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/19/meditation-apps-inner-peace_n_2900544.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help make meditation and mindfulness more accessible, developers have created digital health platforms, such as [[Headspace (digital health platform)|Headspace]], [[Insight Timer]] and Buddhify.

===Wearables===
There are several wearables which measures the breath in order to connect the user back to their body. Wo.Defy is a dress which attempts to reveal the beauty of emotional communication using the common platform of the human breath; proposing the best methods of human to human communication lie within us.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = wo.DEFY|url = https://wodefy.wordpress.com/|website = wo.DEFY|accessdate = 2015-11-10|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spire (activity tracker)|Spire]] measures your breathing patterns to give you insights into your state of mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Spire is the first wearable to track body, breath, and state of mind.|url = http://www.spire.io/|website = www.spire.io|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.zensorium.com/being#introduction Being], the mindfulness tracker from [https://www.zensorium.com/ Zensorium], maps user’s emotions  (stressed, excited normal and calm) through heart rate variability.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = 5 pieces of wearable tech for meditation &amp; mindfulness|url = https://thenextweb.com/lifehacks/2015/10/10/5-pieces-of-wearable-tech-for-meditation-mindfulness/|website = The Next Web|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-wellbe#/story WellBe] monitors heart rate levels and then matches them, through a patent pending algorithm, to specific moments and interactions throughout a user’s day.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [https://www.smartmat.com/ SmartMat] is a responsive mat embedded with 21,000 sensors to detect your body’s balance, pressure and alignment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [http://prana.co/ Prana]'s platform evaluates breath patterns, takes into account the effects of posture on breathing, and differentiates between diaphragmatic and chest breathing, three critical components of assessing the true quality of breathing, previously unaddressed by systems such as spirometers or pulse oximeters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://prana.co/science/|title = Prana|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual Reality===
Sonic Cradle enables users to shape sound with their breath while suspended in a completely dark chamber.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Jay Vidyarthi and Bernhard E. Riecke. 2013. Mediated meditation: cultivating mindfulness with sonic cradle. In CHI '13 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI EA '13). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 2305-2314. {{DOI|10.1145/2468356.2468753}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers conducted a qualitative study with 39 participants to show how persuasive media have the potential to promote long-term psychological health by experientially introducing a stress-relieving, contemplative practice to non-practitioners.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Because the nature of chronic pain is complex, pharmacological analgesics are often not enough to achieve an ideal treatment plan. The system incorporates biofeedback sensors, an immersive virtual environment, and stereoscopic sound titled the "Virtual Meditative Walk" (VMW). It was designed to enable chronic pain patients to learn Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a form of meditation. By providing real-time visual and sonic feedback, VMW enables patients to learn how to manage their pain.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Gromala, Xin Tong, Amber Choo, Mehdi Karamnejad, and Chris D. Shaw. 2015. The Virtual Meditative Walk: Virtual Reality Therapy for Chronic Pain Management. In Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '15). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 521-524. {{DOI|10.1145/2702123.2702344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techno-spirituality==
Intel anthropologist Genevieve Bell has urged the human-computer interaction (HCI) research community to devote more research to the use of technology in spirituality and religion. Techno-spirituality is the study of how technology can facilitate feelings of awe, wonder, transcendence, and mindfulness.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Currently, there are 6,000 applications related to spirituality and religion. This area is in high demand and “important under-explored areas of HCI research”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Spirituality: There's an App for That! (but Not a Lot of Research)|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2468356.2468754|publisher = ACM|journal = CHI '13 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date = 2013-01-01|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 978-1-4503-1952-2|pages = 2315–2324|series = CHI EA '13|doi = 10.1145/2468356.2468754|first = Elizabeth|last = Buie|first2 = Mark|last2 = Blythe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by Bell’s work, researchers (Sterling &amp; Zimmerman) focused on how mobile phones could be incorporated in American Soto Zen Buddhist community, without conflicting with their philosophy of “the here and the now”. They were able to find three ways to use technology to help strengthen ties within the community.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Shared Moments: Opportunities for Mobile Phones in Religious Participation|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1389908.1389928|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the 2007 Conference on Designing for User eXperiences|date = 2007-01-01|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 978-1-60558-308-2|pages = 15:2–15:7|series = DUX '07|doi = 10.1145/1389908.1389928|first = Rhiannon|last = Sterling|first2 = John|last2 = Zimmerman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interaction Design==

===Slow Design===

[[Slow design]] is  a design agenda for technology aimed at reflection and moments of mental rest rather than efficiency in performance.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

===Mindful Design===
[[Design for behaviour change|Mindful design]], based on [[Ellen Langer|Langer]]’s theory of mindfulness,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mindfulness|last = Langer|first = E.J|publisher = Addison Wesley Publishing Company.|year = |isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Counterclockwise|last = Langer|first = E.J.|publisher = Hodder and Stoughton.|year = |isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a design philosophy that incorporates the idea of mindfulness into creating meaningful user oriented design.  A major tenant is the behavior change of a user through awareness and responsibility of meaningful interactions between user and designed object, and this will encourage more desirable human practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://niedderer.org/1961-1b.pdf|title = Mindful Design as a Driver for Social Behaviour Change.|last = Niedderer|first = K.|date = 2013|journal = Consilience and Innovation in Design - Proceedings of the 5th International IASDR|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of mind behavior driven change has been most heavily incorporated design for sustainability. Other approaches include crime prevention or health.  It is also seen in the design of safety objects and the social interaction of performative objects.

Performative objects are identified as design objects that are designed to facilitate mindful awareness of the physical and symbolic social actions and their consequences within which they are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Designing the Performative Object: a study in designing mindful interaction through artefacts, in Redmond, J., D. Durling, and A. de Bono (eds.)|last = Niedderer|first = K.|publisher = FutureGround Proceedings of the Design Research Society International Conference 2004, Volume 2|year = 2004|isbn = 0-9756060-5-0|location = Melbourne, Australia: Monash University|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mindfulness and Silicon Valley ==
Classes in mindfulness practices have become part of some of Silicon Valleys major tech giants.  [[Google]] has implemented a series of bimonthly "mindfulness lunches" as well as built a labyrinth for walking meditations.  Both [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] have incorporated contemplative practices into their corporate culture.  The desired outcome of using mindfulness in the tech workforce is to increase communication and develop the [[emotional intelligence]] of their employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = In Silicon Valley, Meditation Is No Fad. It Could Make Your Career|url = https://www.wired.com/2013/06/meditation-mindfulness-silicon-valley/|website = WIRED|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet Addiction and Mindfulness==
Mindfulness is currently being explored by researchers as a possible treatment for technological addiction, also known as [[Internet addiction disorder]], a form of [[behavioral addiction]].  There has been some consensus in the field of psychology on the benefits of using mindfulness to treat behavioral addiction.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.gamblingtherapy.org/sites/default/files/resources/mindfulness-as-a-treatment-for-behavioural-addiction-2155-6105.1000e122.pdf|title = Mindfulness as a treatment for behavioural-addiction|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Experts in the field say in order to treat technology addiction with mindfulness, one must be non-judgmental about the behavior and pay attention in order to recognize instances in which technology is being used mindlessly.  Then reflect on the helpfulness of the device, and notice the benefits of disconnecting.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://bewell.stanford.edu/mindful-use-of-technology|title = Mindful Use of Technology|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The three keystones of mindfulness are: Intention, Attention and Action.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Technology is said to interfere with mindfulness by causing the individual to forget what matters (intention), the distracts (attention), and then keeps the individual from taking action.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In technological addiction, the reward system, located in the [[mid-brain]] and underlies addiction, evolved to rewards finding and consuming food.  In complex animals this evolution also rewards the exchange of information within the social group.  In humans this has developed into its current form of mass worldwide communication.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~allenlavoie/papers/reddit.pdf|title = The Effects of Feedback on Human Behavior in Social Media: An Inverse Reinforcement Learning Model|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exchange of social information has demonstrated reward based reinforcement, similar to that of [[gamification]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==

Critics of the mindfulness movement in technology focus on several key areas, technophobia, pacifications of genuine grievances in the workforce and disconnection from religious roots. The editor of the New Republic, Eygeny Morozov, questions the value of tech companies who advocate "unplugging" from the modern digital lifestyle as similar to a drug addict taking a tolerance break from the substance they are addicted to in order to then increase the vigor with which those activities are then resumed (3, 4).  They also state that the concept of  Mindfulness in the tech world is jargonistic and amorphous.

=== Mobile ===
Mobile meditation applications like Calm and Headspace have over a million users and are increasing in popularity. Swedish Researchers found that downloading and using the applications for eight weeks made little to no difference for people with major depression and anxiety. They did, however, see improvements with a subgroup with mild levels of depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Seeking Serenity on a Screen|url = http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/seeking-serenity-on-a-screen/?_r=0|website = Well|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disconnectionists===
Criticisms of the slow technology movement are similar to the slow-food movement; it lacks understanding of global scope, and as an individualistic response will not answer the actual problems in technology. This movement has been dubbed by critics as disconnectionists.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Disconnectionists|url = http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/the-disconnectionists/|website = The New Inquiry|date = 2013-11-13|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mindfulness in technology and has been criticized as being less about restoring self and more about stifling autonomy that technology inspires. Anti-disconnectionists state mindfulness and the expressed need to disconnect from technology and the modern world can be accused of being a nostalgia-manipulating marketing tactic and maybe a technological form of [[conservatism]].  Critics state that the labeling of digital connection as debasing and unnatural is in direct proportion to the rapidity of adoption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How adoption speed affects the abandonment of cultural tastes|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/106/20/8146|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2009-05-19|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 2688844|pmid = 19416813|pages = 8146–8150|volume = 106|issue = 20|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0812647106|first = Jonah|last = Berger|first2 = Gaël Le|last2 = Mens}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus it is depicted as a dangerous desire and toxin to be regulated.  This argument itself can be tied back to [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]], [[Walter Benjamin]] on aura, [[Jacques Ellul]] on technique, [[Jean Baudrillard]] on simulations, or [[Zygmunt Bauman]] and the Frankfurt School on modernity and the Enlightenment.  Critics state that disconnectionists see the Internet as having normalized or enforced a repression of an authentic self in favor of a social media avatar.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Thus reflecting the desire to connect with a deeper self, which may itself be an illusion.  The pathologization of technology use then opens the door for [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s idea of "normalization" to be applied to technology in similar fashion as other social ills, which then can become a concept around which social control and management can be applied.

===Buddhist concerns===
There is some concern among Buddhist practitioners that decoupling mediation and mindfulness from the core tenement of Buddhism may have negative effects.  The wide adoption of mindfulness in technology and the tech industry has been accused of increasing passivity in the worker by creating a calm mindstate which then allows for disconnect form actual grievances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mindfulness is not Sati?|url = http://www.theravadin.org/2009/02/13/mindfulness-is-not-sati/|website = Theravadin|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics of mindfulness in [[Cognitive Behavior Therapy]] also comment on this as a possible problem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   However, critics of the movement fear that the secularization of mindfulness, dubbed [[McMindfulness]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Beyond McMindfulness|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ron-purser/beyond-mcmindfulness_b_3519289.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; leads to reinforcement of anti-Buddhist ideas.  Buddhists differentiate between [[Right Mindfulness]] ([[samma sati]]) and [[Wrong Mindfulness]] ([[miccha sati]]). The distinction is not moralistic: the issue is whether the quality of awareness is characterized by wholesome intentions and positive mental qualities that lead to human flourishing and optimal well-being for others as well as oneself.  Mindfulness as adopted by the Silicon Valley Tech giants has been criticized as conveniently shifting the burden of stress and toxic work environment onto the individual employee. Obfuscated by the seemingly inherent qualities of care and humanity, mindfulness is refashioned into a way to coping with and adapting to the stresses and strains of corporate life rather than actually solve them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''mobility analogy, '''also called '''admittance analogy''' or '''Firestone analogy''', is a method of representing a mechanical system by an analogous electrical system.  The advantage of doing this is that there is a large body of theory and analysis techniques concerning complex electrical systems, especially in the field of [[electronic filter|filters]].&lt;ref name="Talbot186"/&gt;  By converting to an electrical representation, these tools in the electrical domain can be directly applied to a mechanical system without modification.  A further advantage occurs in [[electromechanics|electromechanical systems]]: Converting the mechanical part of such a system into the electrical domain allows the entire system to be analysed as a unified whole.

The mathematical behaviour of the simulated electrical system is identical to the mathematical behaviour of the represented mechanical system.  Each [[Electrical element|element]] in the electrical domain has a corresponding element in the mechanical domain with an analogous [[constitutive equation]].  All laws of [[circuit analysis]], such as [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's laws]], that apply in the electrical domain also apply to the mechanical mobility analogy.

The mobility analogy is one of the two main [[mechanical-electrical analogies]] used for representing mechanical systems in the electrical domain, the other being the [[impedance analogy]].  The roles of voltage and current are reversed in these two methods, and the electrical representations produced are the [[dual impedance|dual circuits]] of each other.  The mobility analogy preserves the topology of the mechanical system when transferred to the electrical domain whereas the impedance analogy does not.  On the other hand, the impedance analogy preserves the analogy between [[electrical impedance]] and [[mechanical impedance]] whereas the mobility analogy does not.

== Applications ==
The mobility analogy is widely used to model the behaviour of [[mechanical filter]]s.  These are filters that are intended for use in an electronic circuit, but work entirely by mechanical vibrational waves.  [[Transducer]]s are provided at the input and output of the filter to convert between the electrical and mechanical domains.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;

Another very common use is in the field of audio equipment, such as loudspeakers.  Loudspeakers consist of a transducer and mechanical moving parts.  Acoustic waves themselves are waves of mechanical motion: of air molecules or some other fluid medium.&lt;ref&gt;Eargle, pp. 5–8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elements ==
Before an electrical analogy can be developed for a mechanical system, it must first be described as an abstract [[mechanical network]].  The mechanical system is broken down into a number of ideal elements each of which can then be paired with an electrical analogue.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt;  The symbols used for these mechanical elements on network diagrams are shown in the following sections on each individual element.

The mechanical analogies of lumped [[electrical element]]s are also [[lumped element model|lumped elements]], that is, it is assumed that the mechanical component possessing the element is small enough  that the time taken by [[mechanical wave]]s to propagate from one end of the component to the other can be neglected.  Analogies can also be developed for [[distributed element model|distributed elements]] such as [[transmission line]]s but the greatest benefits are with lumped element circuits.  Mechanical analogies are required for the three passive electrical elements, namely, [[electrical resistance|resistance]], [[inductance]] and [[capacitance]].  What these analogies are is determined by what mechanical property is chosen to represent [[voltage]], and what property is chosen to represent [[electric current|current]].&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, pp. 18–20&lt;/ref&gt;  In the mobility analogy the analogue of voltage is [[velocity]] and the analogue of current is [[force]].&lt;ref name=Eargle5&gt;Eargle, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mechanical impedance]] is defined as the ratio of force to velocity, thus it is not analogous to [[electrical impedance]].  Rather, it is the analogue of [[admittance|electrical admittance]], the inverse of impedance.  Mechanical admittance is more commonly called mobility,&lt;ref&gt;Fahy &amp; Gardonio, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; hence the name of the analogy.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resistance===
[[File:Mobility analogy resistor.svg|thumb|upright|The mechanical symbol for a damper (left) and its electrical analogy (right).&lt;ref name=Eargle4&gt;Eargle, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  The symbol is meant to be evocative of a [[dashpot]].&lt;ref name =Kleiner71&gt;Kleiner, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The mechanical analogy of electrical resistance is the loss of energy of a moving system through such processes as [[friction]].  A mechanical component analogous to a [[resistor]] is a [[shock absorber]] and the property analogous to inverse resistance (conductance) is [[damping]] (inverse, because electrical impedance is the analogy of the inverse of mechanical impedance).  A resistor is governed by the constitutive equation of [[Ohm's law]],

:&lt;math&gt; i = v G &lt;/math&gt;

The analogous equation in the mechanical domain is,

:&lt;math&gt; F = u R_\mathrm m &lt;/math&gt;

:where,
: ''G'' = 1/''R'' is conductance
: ''R'' is resistance
: ''v'' is voltage
: ''i'' is current
: ''R''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is mechanical resistance, or damping
: ''F'' is force
: ''u'' is velocity induced by the force.&lt;ref name=Kleiner71/&gt;

Electrical conductance represents the [[real part]] of [[admittance|electrical admittance]].  Likewise, mechanical resistance is the real part of [[mechanical impedance]].&lt;ref&gt;Atkins &amp; Escudier, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inductance===
[[File:Mobility analogy inductor.svg|thumb|upright|The mechanical symbol for a compliance element (left) and its electrical analogy (right).&lt;ref name=Eargle5/&gt;  The symbol is meant to be evocative of a spring.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The mechanical analogy of inductance in the mobility analogy is compliance.  It is more common in mechanics to discuss [[stiffness]], the inverse of compliance.   A mechanical component analogous to an [[inductor]] is a [[Spring (device)|spring]].  An inductor is governed by the constitutive equation,

:&lt;math&gt; v = L \frac{di}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

The analogous equation in the mechanical domain is a form of [[Hooke's law]],

: &lt;math&gt; u = C_\mathrm m \frac{dF}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

:where,
: ''L'' is inductance
: ''t'' is time
: ''C''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/''S'' is mechanical compliance
: ''S'' is stiffness&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 1651&lt;/ref&gt;

The impedance of an inductor is purely [[imaginary number|imaginary]] and is given by,

:&lt;math&gt; Z = j \omega L &lt;/math&gt;

The analogous mechanical admittance is given by,

:&lt;math&gt; Y_\mathrm m = j \omega C_\mathrm m &lt;/math&gt;

:where,
: ''Z'' is electrical impedance
: ''j'' is the [[imaginary unit]]
: ''ω'' is [[angular frequency]]
: ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is mechanical impedance.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capacitance===
[[File:Mobility analogy capacitor.svg|thumb|upright|The mechanical symbol for a mass (left) and its electrical analogy (right).&lt;ref name=Eargle5/&gt;  The square angle below the mass is meant to indicate that movement of the mass is relative to a frame of reference.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The mechanical analogy of capacitance in the mobility analogy is [[mass]].  A mechanical component analogous to a [[capacitor]] is a large, rigid weight.  A capacitor is governed by the constitutive equation,

:&lt;math&gt; i = C \frac {dv}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

The analogous equation in the mechanical domain is [[Newton's second law of motion]],

: &lt;math&gt; F = M \frac {du}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

: where,
: ''C'' is capacitance
: ''M'' is mass

The impedance of a capacitor is purely imaginary and is given by,

:&lt;math&gt; Z = {1 \over j \omega C} &lt;/math&gt;

The analogous mechanical admittance is given by,

:&lt;math&gt; Y_\mathrm m = {1 \over j \omega M} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inertance ===
A curious difficulty arises with mass as the analogy of an electrical element.   It is connected with the fact that in mechanical systems the velocity of the mass (and more importantly, its acceleration) is always measured against some fixed reference frame, usually the earth.  Considered as a two-terminal system element, the mass has one terminal at velocity &lt;nowiki&gt;''u''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, analogous to electric potential.  The other terminal is at zero velocity and is analogous to electric ground potential.  Thus, mass cannot be used as the analogue of an ungrounded capacitor.&lt;ref name="Busch-Vishniac, p. 20"&gt;Busch-Vishniac, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

This led [[Malcolm C. Smith]] of the [[University of Cambridge]] in 2002 to define a new energy storing element for mechanical networks called ''inertance''.  A component that possesses inertance is called an [[inerter (mechanical networks)|inerter]].  The two terminals of an inerter, unlike a mass, are allowed to have two different, arbitrary velocities and accelerations.  The constitutive equation of an inerter is given by,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 1649–1650&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; F = B \left ( \frac {du_\mathrm 2}{dt} - \frac {du_\mathrm 1}{dt} \right ) = B \frac {d\Delta u}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

:where,
:''F'' is an equal and opposite force applied to the two terminals
:''B'' is the inertance
:''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the velocities at terminals 1 and 2 respectively
:Δ''u'' = ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;

Inertance has the same units as mass (kilograms in the [[SI system]]) and the name indicates its relationship to [[inertia]].  Smith did not just define a network theoretic element, he also suggested a construction for a real mechanical component and made a small prototype.  Smith's inerter consists of a plunger able to slide in or out of a cylinder.  The plunger is connected to a [[rack and pinion]] gear which drives a flywheel inside the cylinder.  There can be two counter-rotating flywheels in order to prevent a [[torque]] developing.  Energy provided in pushing the plunger in will be returned when the plunger moves in the opposite direction, hence the device stores energy rather than dissipates it just like a block of mass.  However, the actual mass of the inerter can be very small, an ideal inerter has no mass.  Two points on the inerter, the plunger and the cylinder case, can be independently connected to other parts of the mechanical system with neither of them necessarily connected to ground.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 1650–1651&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's inerter has found an application in [[Formula One]] racing where it is known as the J-damper.  It is used as an alternative to the now banned [[tuned mass damper]] and forms part of the vehicle suspension.  It may have been first used secretly by [[McLaren]] in 2005 following a collaboration with Smith.  Other teams are now believed to be using it.  The inerter is much smaller than the tuned mass damper and smoothes out [[contact patch]] load variations on the tyres.&lt;ref&gt;De Groote&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith also suggests using the inerter to reduce machine vibration.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 1661&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty with mass in mechanical analogies is not limited to the mobility analogy.  A corresponding problem also occurs in the impedance analogy, but in that case it is ungrounded inductors, rather than capacitors, that cannot be represented with the standard elements.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 1649&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resonator===
A mechanical resonator consists of both a mass element and a compliance element.  Mechanical resonators are analogous to electrical [[LC circuit]]s consisting of inductance and capacitance.  Real mechanical components unavoidably have both mass and compliance so it is a practical proposition to make resonators as a single component.  In fact, it is more difficult to make a pure mass or pure compliance as a single component.  A spring can be made with a certain compliance and mass minimised, or a mass can be made with compliance minimised, but neither can be eliminated altogether.  Mechanical resonators are a key component of mechanical filters.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Huang, pp. 377–383&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generators===
[[File:Mobility analogy voltage.svg|thumb|upright|The mechanical symbol for a constant velocity generator (left) and its electrical analogy (right)&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Kleiner, p. 77|Beranek &amp; Mellow, p. 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Mobility analogy current.svg|thumb|upright|The mechanical symbol for a constant force generator (left) and its electrical analogy (right)&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Kleiner, p. 76|Beranek &amp; Mellow, p. 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Analogues exist for the active electrical elements of the [[voltage source]] and the [[current source]] (generators).  The mechanical analogue in the mobility analogy of the constant current generator is the constant force generator.  The mechanical analogue of the constant voltage generator is the constant velocity generator.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a constant force generator is the [[constant-force spring]].   An example of a practical constant velocity generator is a lightly loaded powerful machine, such as a [[Electric motor|motor]], driving a [[belt (mechanical)|belt]].  This is analogous to a real voltage source, such as a battery, which remains near constant-voltage with load provided that the load resistance is much higher than the battery internal resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transducers ===
[[Electromechanics|Electromechanical systems]] require [[transducer]]s to convert between the electrical and mechanical domains.  They are analogous to [[two-port network]]s and like those can be described by a pair of simultaneous equations and four arbitrary parameters.  There are numerous possible representations, but the form most applicable to the mobility analogy has the arbitrary parameters in units of admittance.  In matrix form (with the electrical side taken as port 1) this representation is,

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} i \\ u \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} y_{11} &amp; y_{12} \\ y_{21} &amp; y_{22} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v \\ F \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

The element &lt;math&gt; y_{22} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the short circuit mechanical admittance, that is, the admittance presented by the mechanical side of the transducer when zero voltage (short circuit) is applied to the electrical side. The element &lt;math&gt; y_{11} \,&lt;/math&gt;, conversely, is the unloaded electrical admittance, that is, the admittance presented to the electrical side when the mechanical side is not driving a load (zero force). The remaining two elements, &lt;math&gt; y_{21} \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; y_{12} \,&lt;/math&gt;, describe the transducer forward and reverse transfer functions respectively.  They are both analogous to [[transconductance|transfer admittances]] and are hybrid ratios of an electrical and mechanical quantity.&lt;ref&gt;Debnath &amp; Roy, pp. 566–567
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transformers===
The mechanical analogy of a [[transformer]] is a [[simple machine]] such as a [[pulley]] or a [[lever]].  The force applied to the load can be greater or less than the input force depending on whether the [[mechanical advantage]] of the machine is greater or less than unity respectively.  Mechanical advantage is analogous to the inverse of transformer turns ratio in the mobility analogy.  A mechanical advantage less than unity is analogous to a step-up transformer and greater than unity is analogous to a step-down transformer.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Kleiner, pp. 74–76|Beranek &amp; Mellow, pp. 76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

===Simple resonant circuit===

[[File:Mobility analogy resonator.svg|thumb|upright=3|center|Simple mechanical resonator (left) and its mobility analogy equivalent circuit (right)]]
The figure shows a mechanical arrangement of a platform of mass ''M'' that is suspended above the substrate by a spring of stiffness ''S'' and a damper of resistance ''R''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.  The mobility analogy equivalent circuit is shown to the right of this arrangement and consists of a [[RLC circuit#Parallel RLC circuit|parallel resonant circuit]].  This system has a [[resonant frequency]], and may have a [[natural frequency]] of oscillation if not too heavily damped.&lt;ref&gt;Eargle, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The principal advantage of the mobility analogy over its alternative, the [[impedance analogy]], is that it preserves the topology of the mechanical system.  Elements that are in series in the mechanical system are in series in the electrical equivalent circuit and elements in parallel in the mechanical system remain in parallel in the electrical equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Busch-Vishniac, pp. 20–21|Eargle, pp. 4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal disadvantage of the mobility analogy is that it does not maintain the analogy between electrical and mechanical impedance.  Mechanical impedance is represented as an electrical admittance and a mechanical resistance is represented as an electrical conductance in the electrical equivalent circuit.  Force is not analogous to voltage ([[Generator (circuit theory)|generator]] voltages are often called [[electromotive force]]), but rather, it is analogous to current.&lt;ref name="Busch-Vishniac, p. 20"/&gt;

== History ==

Historically, the impedance analogy was in use long before the mobility analogy.  Mechanical admittance and the associated mobility analogy were introduced by F. A. Firestone in 1932 to overcome the issue of preserving topologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Pierce, p. 321|Firestone|Pusey, p. 547}}&lt;/ref&gt;  W. Hähnle independently had the same idea in Germany.  [[Horace M. Trent]] developed a treatment for analogies in general from a mathematical [[graph theory]] perspective and introduced a new analogy of his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Findeisen, p. 26|Busch-Vishniac, pp. 19–20|Hähnle|Trent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8127">A '''multi-compartment model''' is a type of [[mathematical model]] used for describing the way materials or energies are transmitted among the ''compartments'' of a system. Each compartment is assumed to be a homogeneous entity within which the entities being modelled are equivalent. For instance, in a pharmacokinetic model, the compartments may represent different sections of a body within which the concentration of a drug is assumed to be uniformly equal.

Hence a multi-compartment model is a [[lumped parameters]] model.

Multi-compartment models are used in many fields including [[pharmacokinetics]], [[compartmental models in epidemiology|epidemiology]], [[biomedicine]], [[systems theory]], [[Complex systems|complexity theory]], engineering, physics, information science and social science. The circuits systems can be viewed as a multi-compartment model as well.

In systems theory, it involves the description of a network whose components are compartments that represent a population of elements that are equivalent with respect to the manner in which they process input signals to the compartment.

:
*Instant homogeneous distribution of materials or energies within a "compartment."
*The exchange rate of materials or energies among the compartments is related to the densities of these compartments.
*Usually, it is desirable that the materials do not undergo chemical reactions while transmitting among the compartments.
*When concentration of the cell is of interest, typically the volume is assumed to be constant over time, though this may not be totally true in reality. 
     
Most commonly, the mathematics of multi-compartment models is simplified to provide only a single parameter—such as concentration—within a compartment.

== Single-compartment model ==
[[Image:Singlecell.PNG]]

Possibly the simplest application of multi-compartment model is in the single-cell concentration monitoring (see the figure above). If the volume of a cell is ''V'', the [[mass]] of [[solution|solute]] is ''q'', the input is ''u''(''t'') and the secretion of the solution is proportional to the density of it within the cell, then the concentration of the solution ''C'' within the cell over time is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d}t}=u(t)-kq&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C=\frac{q}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' is the proportionality.

==Multi-Compartment Model==
As the number of compartments increases, the model can be very complex and the solutions usually beyond ordinary calculation.

The formulae for '''n-cell''' multi-compartment models become:
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\dot{q}_1=q_1 k_{11}+q_2 k_{12}+\cdots+q_n k_{1n}+u_1(t) \\
\dot{q}_2=q_1 k_{21}+q_2 k_{22}+\cdots+q_n k_{2n}+u_2(t) \\
\vdots\\
\dot{q}_n=q_1 k_{n1}+q_2 k_{n2}+\cdots+q_n k_{nn}+u_n(t)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where 
:&lt;math&gt;0=\sum^n_{i=1}{k_{ij}}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;j=1,2,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt; (as the total 'contents' of all compartments is constant in a closed system)

Or in matrix forms:
: &lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{\dot{q}}=\mathbf{Kq}+\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;

Where
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}=\begin{bmatrix}
k_{11}&amp; k_{12} &amp;\cdots &amp;k_{1n}\\
k_{21}&amp; k_{22} &amp; \cdots&amp;k_{2n}\\
\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\ddots&amp;\vdots \\
k_{n1}&amp; k_{n2} &amp;\cdots &amp;k_{nn}\\
\end{bmatrix} 
\mathbf{q}=\begin{bmatrix}
q_1 \\
q_2 \\
\vdots \\
q_n
\end{bmatrix}
\mathbf{u}=\begin{bmatrix}
u_1(t) \\
u_2(t) \\
\vdots \\
u_n(t)
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp;\cdots &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix}\mathbf{K}=\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp;\cdots &amp; 0\\
\end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt; (as the total 'contents' of all compartments is constant in a closed system)

In the special case of a closed system (see below) i.e. where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}=0&lt;/math&gt; then there is a general solution.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} = c_1 e^{\lambda_1 t} \mathbf{v_1} + c_2 e^{\lambda_2 t} \mathbf{v_2} + \cdots + c_n e^{\lambda_n t} \mathbf{v_n}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;, ... and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_n&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_2}&lt;/math&gt;, ... and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_n}&lt;/math&gt; are the respective [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvectors]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt;; and &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt;, .... and &lt;math&gt;c_n&lt;/math&gt; are constants.

However it can be shown that given the above requirement to ensure the 'contents' of a closed system are constant, then for every pair of [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue]] and [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvector]] then either &lt;math&gt;\lambda=0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp;\cdots &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix}\mathbf{v}=0&lt;/math&gt; and also that one [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue]] is 0, say &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt;

So
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} = c_1  \mathbf{v_1} + c_2 e^{\lambda_2 t} \mathbf{v_2} + \cdots + c_n e^{\lambda_n t} \mathbf{v_n}&lt;/math&gt;

Where
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp;\cdots &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix}\mathbf{v_i}=0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}=2, 3, \dots n&lt;/math&gt;

This solution can be rearranged:

: &lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{q} = 
\Bigg[ \mathbf{v_1}\begin{bmatrix}
 c_1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
 \end{bmatrix}
+ \mathbf{v_2}\begin{bmatrix}
 0 &amp; c_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
 \end{bmatrix}
+ \dots + \mathbf{v_n}\begin{bmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; c_n \\
 \end{bmatrix} \Bigg]
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
e^{\lambda_2t} \\
 \vdots \\
e^{\lambda_nt} \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

This somewhat inelegant equation demonstrates that all solutions of an ''n-cell'' multi-compartment model with constant or no inputs are of the form:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{q} = \mathbf{A}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
e^{\lambda_2t} \\
 \vdots \\
e^{\lambda_nt} \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a ''nxn'' matrix and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_3&lt;/math&gt;, ... and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_n&lt;/math&gt; are constants.
Where &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp;\cdots &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix}\mathbf{A}=\begin{bmatrix}
 a &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

==Model topologies==
Generally speaking, as the number of compartments increase, it is challenging both to find the algebraic and numerical solutions of the model. However, there are special cases of models, which rarely exist in nature, when the topologies exhibit certain regularities that the solutions become easier to find. The model can be classified according to the interconnection of cells and input/output characteristics:

#'''Closed model''': No sinks or source, lit. all ''k''&lt;sub&gt;oi&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0;
#'''Open model''': There are sinks or/and sources among cells.
#'''Catenary model''': All compartments are arranged in a chain, with each pool connecting only to its neighbors. This model has two or more cells.
#'''Cyclic model''': It's a special case of the catenary model, with three or more cells, in which the first and last cell are connected, i.e. ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ne; 0 or/and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ne; 0.
#'''Mammillary model''': Consists of a central compartment with peripheral compartments connecting to it. There are no interconnections among other compartments. 
#'''Reducible model''': It's a set of unconnected models. It bears great resemblance to the computer concept of '''forest''' as against '''trees'''.

'''Oceanic dispersal''' is a type of [[biological dispersal]] that occurs when terrestrial organisms transfer from one land mass to another by way of a sea crossing. Often this occurs via large rafts of floating vegetation such as are sometimes seen floating down major rivers in the tropics and washing out to sea, occasionally with animals trapped on them.&lt;ref name=Mittermeier&gt;{{cite book | last = Mittermeier | first = R.A. | authorlink = Russell Mittermeier | title = Lemurs of Madagascar | edition = 2nd | publisher = Conservation International | year = 2006 | pages = 24–26 | isbn=1-881173-88-7|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dispersal via such a raft is sometimes referred to as a "rafting event".

Colonization of land masses by plants can also occur via long-distance oceanic dispersal of floating seeds.&lt;ref name="Won2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Won | first1 = H. | last2 = Renner | first2 = S.

==History==
Rafting has played an important role in the colonization of isolated land masses by mammals. Prominent examples include [[Madagascar]], which has been isolated for ~120 million years ([[Year#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]), and [[South America]], which was isolated for much of the [[Cenozoic]]. Both land masses, for example, appear to have received their [[primate]]s by this mechanism. According to genetic evidence, the common ancestor of the [[lemur]]s of [[Madagascar]] appears to have crossed the [[Mozambique Channel]] by rafting between 50 and 60 Ma ago.&lt;ref name=Roos&gt;{{cite journal | first = Christian | last = Roos |author2=Schmitz, Jürgen |author3=Zischler, Hans | title = Primate jumping genes elucidate strepsirrhine phylogeny | journal = PNAS | date = July 2004 | volume = 101 | pages = 10650–10654 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/101/29/10650.full.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0403852101 | pmid = 15249661 | issue = 29 | pmc = 489989 | bibcode=2004PNAS..10110650R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sellers&gt;{{cite web | url = http://homepage.mac.com/wis/Personal/lectures/human-origins/PrimateEvolution.pdf | title = Primate Evolution | accessdate = 2008-10-23 | last = Sellers | first = Bill | date = 2000-10-20 | format = PDF | publisher = [[University of Edinburgh]] | pages = 13–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Ali&amp;Huber"&gt;{{Cite journal

Colonization of groups of islands can occur by an [[Iteration|iterative]] rafting process sometimes called [[island hopping]]. Such a process appears to have played a role, for example, in the colonization of the [[Caribbean]] by [[Mammals of the Caribbean|mammals of South American origin]] (including caviomorphs and monkeys).&lt;ref name = "Hedges2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3417/0026-6493(2006)93[231:POTAAO]2.0.CO;2| title = Paleogeography of the Antilles and Origin of West Indian Terrestrial Vertebrates1| journal = [[Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden]]| volume = 93| issue = 2| pages = 231–244| year = 2006| last1 = Hedges | first1 = S.

DNA sequence analysis suggests that ancestors of the genus dispersed from southern South America to South Africa about 10 million years (Ma) ago, where the most [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] clade is found; subsequent rafting events then took the genus eastward with the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] to Australia, then to New Zealand and finally to Chile by about 2 Ma ago.&lt;ref name="Kuntner2016" /&gt; Another example among spiders is the species ''[[Moggridgea rainbowi]]'', the only Australian member of a genus otherwise endemic to Africa, with a divergence date of 2 to 16 Ma ago.&lt;ref name="Kuntner2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuntner|first1=M.|last2=Harrison|first2=S.

However, oceanic dispersal of terrestrial species may not always take the form of rafting; in some cases, swimming or simply floating may suffice. Tortoises of the genus ''[[Chelonoidis]]'' arrived in South America from Africa in the Oligocene;&lt;ref name = "Le et al."&gt;{{cite journal

The dispersal of [[anthracothere]]s from Asia to Africa about 40 Ma ago,&lt;ref name = "Chaimanee"/&gt; and the much more recent dispersal of [[hippopotamus|hippo]]s (relatives and probably descendants of anthracotheres) from Africa to Madagascar may have occurred by floating or swimming.&lt;ref name = "Ali&amp;Huber"/&gt;

==Observation==
The first documented example of colonization of a land mass by rafting occurred in the aftermath of hurricanes [[Hurricane Luis|Luis]] and [[Hurricane Marilyn|Marilyn]] in the [[Caribbean]] in 1995. A raft of uprooted trees carrying fifteen or more [[green iguana]]s was observed by fishermen landing on the east side of [[Anguilla]] – an island where they had never before been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=E.|date=1998-10-15|title=Iguanas ride the waves|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/news981015-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iguanas had apparently been caught on the trees and rafted two hundred miles across the ocean from [[Guadeloupe]], where they are indigenous.&lt;ref name="Censky1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Censky|first1=E.

The advent of human civilization has created opportunities for organisms to raft on floating artifacts, which may be more durable than natural floating objects. This phenomenon was noted following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 Tōhoku tsunami]] in Japan, with about 300 species found to have been carried on debris by the [[North Pacific Current]] to the west coast of North America (although no colonizations have been detected thus far).&lt;ref name="Chown2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Chown|first1=S.

Skinner created the operant chamber as a variation of the [[Edward Thorndike#Connectionism|puzzle box]] originally created by [[Edward Thorndike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Daniel L. |last1=Schacter |first2=Daniel T. |last2=Gilbert |first3=Daniel M. |last3=Wegner |first4=Matthew K. |last4=Nock |year=2014 |chapter=B. F. Skinner: The Role of Reinforcement and Punishment |pages=278–80 |title=Psychology |edition=3rd |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-1-4641-5528-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

An operant conditioning chamber permits experimenters to study behavior conditioning (training) by teaching a subject animal to perform certain actions (like pressing a lever) in response to specific stimuli, such as a light or sound signal. When the subject correctly performs the behavior, the chamber mechanism delivers food or another reward. In some cases, the mechanism delivers a punishment for incorrect or missing responses. For instance, to test how operant conditioning works for certain invertebrates, such as fruit flies, psychologists use a device known as a "heat box". Essentially this takes up the same form as the Skinner box, but the box is composed of two sides: one side that can undergo temperature change and the other that does not. As soon as the invertebrate crosses over to the side that can undergo a temperature change, the area is heated up. Eventually, the invertebrate will be conditioned to stay on the side that does not undergo a temperature change. This goes to the extent that even when the temperature is turned to its lowest point, the fruit fly will still refrain from approaching that area of the heat box.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brembs|first=Björn|title=Operant conditioning in invertebrates|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959438803001570|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|volume=13|issue=6|pages=710–717|doi=10.1016/j.conb.2003.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of apparatuses allow experimenters to perform studies in conditioning and training through reward/punishment mechanisms.

==Structure==
The structure forming the shell of a chamber is a box large enough to easily accommodate the animal being used as a subject. (Commonly used model animals include [[rodent]]s—usually [[lab rat]]s—[[pigeon]]s, and [[primate]]s). It is often [[soundproofing|sound-proof]] and light-proof to avoid distracting stimuli.

Operant chambers have at least one operandum (or "manipulandum"), and often two or more, that can automatically detect the occurrence of a [[behavior]]al response or action. Typical operanda for primates and rats are response levers; if the subject presses the lever, the opposite end moves and closes a switch that is monitored by a computer or other programmed device. Typical operanda for pigeons and other [[bird]]s are [[telegraph key|response keys]] with a switch that closes if the bird pecks at the key with sufficient [[force]]. The other minimal requirement of a conditioning chamber is that it has a means of delivering a primary reinforcer (a reward, such as food, etc.) or [[unconditioned stimulus]] like food (usually pellets) or water. It can also register the delivery of a conditioned reinforcer, such as an LED (see Jackson &amp; Hackenberg 1996 in the ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'' for example) signal as a "token".

Despite such a simple configuration, one operandum and one feeder, it is possible to investigate many psychological phenomena. Modern operant conditioning chambers typically have many operanda, like many response levers, two or more feeders, and a variety of devices capable of generating many [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], including lights, sounds, music, figures, and drawings. Some configurations use an LCD panel for the computer generation of a variety of visual stimuli.

Some operant chambers can also have electrified nets or floors so that shocks can be given to the animals; or lights of different colors that give information about when the food is available.
Although the use of shock is not unheard of, approval may be needed in countries that regulate experimentation on animals.

==Research impact==
Operant conditioning chambers have become common in a variety of research disciplines including [[behavioral pharmacology]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The results of these experiments inform many disciplines outside of psychology, such as [[behavioral economics]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

An [[urban legend]] spread concerning Skinner putting his daughter through an experiment such as this, causing great controversy. His daughter later debunked this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/one-man-and-a-baby-box/|title=B.F.

[[Social networking service]]s such as [[Google]], [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] have been identified as using the techniques, critics use terms such as ''Skinnerian Marketing''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davidow|first1=Bill|title=Skinner Marketing: We're the Rats, and Facebook Likes Are the Reward|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/06/skinner-marketing-were-the-rats-and-facebook-likes-are-the-reward/276613/|website=The Atlantic|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=1 May 2015|ref=marketing}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the way the companies use the ideas to keep users engaged and using the service.

[[Gamification]], the technique of using game design elements in non-game contexts, has also been described as using operant conditioning and other behaviorist techniques to encourage desired user behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Slot machines perfected addictive gaming.

==History==
Parity was formed in 1986 as the "Campaign for Equal State Pension Ages" (CESPA) &lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2003998.stm BBC NEWS | Business | Threat to National Insurance increase&lt;!-- Both generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and its principal aim was to obtain for men the same [state pension] age as enjoyed by women.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The organisation changed its name to "Parity" in 1997 to reflect growing concern regarding increased unequal treatment of men and women in other areas by the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hertsdirect.org/comdirectory/comvol/trade2y/tdfina3y/pensions4/?view=Printlist hertsdirect.org Pensions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

CESPA's inaugural meeting was held on 29 August 1986 in Committee Room 1 of Manchester Town Hall. The ten founder members were G.W. Alderton, D.Higgins, D.J.D Yarwood, J.H Bennett, E.L Anderson, J.Greenwood, M.D Davidson, J.Graham, D.G Lindsay, and J. Bradfield.
The original CESPA constitution was agreed. The meeting appointed David Lindsay as Chairman, Geoff Alderton as Vice-Chairman, David Yarwood as Hon Secretary and John Bennett as Treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parity-uk.org/history_of_cespa1.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Parity was denied charitable status for a number of years because it was seeking changes in the law to redress statutory [[sex discrimination]], and thus was deemed to be political.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-912855991.html Parity &amp; Equal rights for men - Mankind | HighBeam Research - FREE trial&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It finally gained [[Charitable organization#United Kingdom|charitable status]] in 2005 following a change to the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Organisation==
The organisation is run entirely by volunteers and receives no public funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parity-uk.org/organisation.php Parity - Campaigning for equal rights for UK men and women&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It had an income of £1,016 in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/PrintReport.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1107795&amp;ReportType=BW Charity-commission.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

In its constitution it states its objectives are "to promote and protect the equal rights of men and women to the enjoyment of all civil, political, economic social and cultural rights under the law" and "to institute proceedings in the UK or appropriate European Courts for the purpose of establishing or protecting any such equal rights."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parity-uk.org/index.php Parity - Campaigning for equal rights for UK men and women&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==
Parity has had some notable successes over the years, particularly in addressing statutory sex discrimination. Their campaigns have stopped government [[sex discrimination]] which, in the case of winter fuel payments, had denied an estimated £20 million per year to males between the ages of 60-65.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/567208.stm BBC News | UK | Winter fuel payments 'sexist'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Parity claims successes in four main areas: [[Prescription (medical)|prescription]] charges, winter fuel payments, [[Bus_pass#UK|bus travel concessions]] and, in association with others, [[widower]]'s benefits:

===Prescription charges===
Parity's first major success began in 1993 under its original name, when CESPA member Cyril Richardson, an [[asthmatic]], took the government to court over sex discrimination in entitlement for free [[Prescription drug|prescriptions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=16471 Equal rights for men at the chemist's - Article - TES Connect&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2001/rp01-080.pdf The Travel Concessions (Eligibility) Bill [HL&amp;#93; Bill 38 of 2001-02&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618214600/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2001/rp01-080.pdf |date=18 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, in 1995 the European Court of Justice ruled that it was unlawful to charge men aged 60–65 for prescriptions when they were free to women. As a result, men now receive benefits in the order of an estimated £30 million per annum. Additionally, £10 million in charges was refunded to those who had wrongly paid for prescriptions in the previous 3 months before the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ay06C8wAdAAC&amp;pg=PA705&amp;lpg=PA705&amp;dq=1995+nhs+prescription+charges+men&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=J7Ec4-rWx0&amp;sig=K1uuQ8Ttlf3tWYz4EuM37bl9JHg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DoTiSf6MM8WhjAfT7bnUDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4 The textbook of pharmaceutical medicine - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/311/7013/1118/a Men can have free prescriptions at 60 - 311 (7013): 1118 - bmj.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Winter fuel payments===
In 1998 Parity member John Taylor went to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] to contest the fact that the government was denying [[winter fuel payment]]s to men aged 60–65 that women were able to receive. It was argued that this was a breach of European laws on equality in social security,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/189612.stm BBC News | UK | Winter fuel case goes to Europe&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and that such discrimination was blatant and unjustifiable.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/winter-fuel-cash-cheats-men-says-court-chief-1121423.html Winter fuel cash cheats men, says court chief - News - The Independent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The case was referred to the [[European Court of Justice]] who ruled in Mr Taylor's favour in December 1999.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The ruling meant up to £26 million per annum in benefits being given to men that otherwise would have been denied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/455023.stm BBC News | UK Politics | Fuel payments ruling due&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bus travel concessions===
In 2000 Parity took the Government to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] over the fact that it denied [[free travel pass|free bus travel]] to men aged 60–65.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.thisisyork.co.uk/2000/4/28/317100.html Postman leads fight to change bus pass policy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070730222225/http://archive.thisisyork.co.uk/2000/4/28/317100.html |date=30 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Parity's previous successes, the government had refused to end discrimination in this area.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ministers-fight-free-bus-pass-for-men-at-60-634573.html Ministers fight free bus pass for men at 60 - UK Politics, UK - The Independent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in June 2001 it became clear that Parity would win the case if it went to court and the government relented, with [[John Prescott]] announcing men would receive free [[bus pass]]es from age 60. Controversially, Prescott hailed the move as "another example of the Government providing extra help for pensioners" whereas it had effectively been forced into the move by the European Court of Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1323123/Men-over-60-to-be-eligible-for-free-bus-passes.html Men over 60 to be eligible for free bus passes - Telegraph&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Travel Concessions (Eligibility) Bill finally passed in 2003 resulting in males receiving the £50 million per annum in benefits that the state had denied them.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2880989.stm BBC NEWS | Business | End to 'sexist' bus fares&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Widowers benefits===
Parity campaigned to end sexism in the payment of widows benefits and bereavement tax allowances. These were previously only paid to women and not men. The campaign achieved success in 2001 as a result the benefits are now available to both genders.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2002647.stm BBC NEWS | Business | Widowers besiege Europe with benefit claims&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic violence statistics===
In 2008 Parity campaigned to stop the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] making false statements that the "overwhelming" majority of domestic violence victims were women, whereas in fact about one in three victims is male. With the aid of the [[UK Statistics Authority]] the organisation succeeded and the incorrect claims were removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports---correspondence/correspondence/new-component.pdf Statisticsauthority.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports---correspondence/correspondence/letter-from-sir-roger-jowell-to-keir-starmer-qc-30-march-2009.pdf Statisticsauthority.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation also forced [[Gillian Morgan]] of the [[Welsh Assembly]] to stop making the same claims in the "Strategic Action Plan to Address Violence to Women".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/reports---correspondence/correspondence/Copy_of_letter-from-sir-michael-scholar-to-dame-gillian-morgan-021009.pdf Statisticsauthority.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current campaigns==
Parity's main current campaign is to equalise the state [[pension]] ages for men and women in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parity-uk.org/successes.php Parity - Campaigning for equal rights for UK men and women&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently this is now due to take place in 2018.

Other objectives include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parity-uk.org/objectives.php Parity - Campaigning for equal rights for UK men and women&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Equal state funding for treatment and research of [[Sex and illness|male and female specific diseases]].
*Equal liability for men and women over 60 for [[National Insurance]] contributions.
*Equal treatment of male and female victims of [[domestic violence]].
*Better government policies to ensure a more equal gender balance in [[primary school]] teaching and to boost the academic achievements of working class white children.
*Funding for research into [[Life_expectancy#Gender_differences|life expectancy]] inequalities between men and women.
*Equal status for separated parents and better enforcement of [[Contact (law)|contact]] and maintenance orders.
*Equal anonymity for defendants and complainants in [[sex offence]] cases until conviction.

In [[mathematics]], a '''posetal category''', or '''thin category''',&lt;ref&gt;{{nlab|id=thin+category|title=Thin category}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] whose [[Category (mathematics)#Small and large categories|homsets]] each contain at most one morphism. As such, a posetal category amounts to a [[preordered class]] (or a [[preordered set]], if its objects form a set). As suggested by the name, the further requirement that the category be [[Skeleton (category theory)|skeletal]] is often assumed for the definition of "posetal"; in the case of a category that is posetal, being skeletal is equivalent to the requirement that the only isomorphisms are the identity morphisms, equivalently that the preordered class satisfies [[antisymmetry]] and hence, if a set, is a [[poset]].

All [[diagram (category theory)|diagram]]s [[commutative diagram|commute]] in a posetal category. When the commutative diagrams of a category are interpreted as a typed equational theory whose objects are the types, a codiscrete posetal category corresponds to an inconsistent theory understood as one satisfying the axiom ''x'' = ''y'' at all types.

Viewing a [[2-category]] as an [[enriched category]] whose hom-objects are categories, the hom-objects of any extension of a posetal category to a [[2-category]] having the same 1-cells are [[monoid]]s.

Some lattice-theoretic structures are definable as posetal categories of a certain kind, usually with the stronger assumption of being skeletal. For example, a poset may be defined as a posetal category, a [[distributive lattice]] as a posetal [[distributive category]], a [[Heyting algebra]] as a posetal finitely [[cocomplete]] [[cartesian closed category]], and a [[Boolean algebra]] as a posetal finitely cocomplete [[*-autonomous category]]. Conversely, categories, distributive categories, finitely cocomplete cartesian closed categories, and finitely cocomplete *-autonomous categories can be considered the respective [[categorification]]s of posets, distributive lattices, Heyting algebras, and Boolean algebras.

'''Psychological resilience''' is the ability to successfully cope with a crisis and to return to pre-crisis status quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Terte|first=Ian|last2=Stephens|first2=Christine|date=2014|title=Psychological Resilience of Workers in High-Risk Occupations|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smi.2627|journal=Stress and Health|language=en|volume=30|issue=5|pages=353–355|doi=10.1002/smi.2627|issn=1532-3005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resilience exists when the person uses "mental processes and behaviors in promoting personal assets and protecting self from the potential negative effects of stressors".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Ivan T.|last2=Cooper|first2=Cary L.|last3=Sarkar|first3=Mustafa|last4=Curran|first4=Thomas|date=2015-04-25|title=Resilience training in the workplace from 2003 to 2014: A systematic review|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/joop.12120|journal=Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology|language=en|volume=88|issue=3|pages=533–562|doi=10.1111/joop.12120|issn=0963-1798}}&lt;/ref&gt; In simpler terms, psychological resilience exists in people who develop psychological and behavioral capabilities that allow them to remain calm during crises/chaos and to move on from the incident without long-term negative consequences. Psychological resilience is an evolutionary advantage that most people have and use to manage normal stressors.

==Background==

Resilience is generally thought of as a "positive adaptation" after a stressful or adverse situation.&lt;ref name="Hopf S.M 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hopf S.M |title= Risk and Resilience in Children Coping with Parental Divorce|journal= Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science |year=2010|url=http://dujs.dartmouth.edu/spring-2010/risk-and-resilience-in-children-coping-with-parental-divorce#.VTceVpNGRHA}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a person is "bombarded by daily stress, it disrupts their internal and external sense of balance, presenting challenges as well as opportunities". Resilience is the integrated adaptation of physical, mental and spiritual aspects in a set of "good or bad" circumstances, a coherent sense of self that is able to maintain normative developmental tasks that occur at various stages of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Richardson | first=Glenn E. | title=The metatheory of resilience and resiliency | journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | volume=58 | issue=3 | year=2002 | issn=0021-9762 | doi=10.1002/jclp.10020 | pages=307–321 | pmid=11836712}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Children's Institute of the [[University of Rochester]] explains that "resilience research is focused on studying those who engage in life with hope and humor despite devastating losses".&lt;ref name="childrens_institute"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.childrensinstitute.net/sites/default/files/documents/children-resilience-family-court-review.pdf | title=Fostering children's resilience in the aftermath of divorce: The role of evidence-based programs for children | work=Children's Institute, [[University of Rochester]] | date=2005 | accessdate=30 March 2016 | author=Pedro-Carroll, JoAnne | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is important to note that resilience is not only about overcoming a deeply stressful situation, but also coming out of the said situation with "competent functioning". Resiliency allows a person to rebound from adversity as a strengthened and more resourceful person.

==History==

The first research on resilience was published in 1973. The study used [[epidemiology]], which is the study of disease prevalence, to uncover the risks and the protective factors that now help define resilience.&lt;ref&gt;Garmezy, N. (1973). "Competence and adaptation in adult schizophrenic patients and children at risk", pp. 163–204 in Dean, S. R. (Ed.), ''Schizophrenia: The first ten Dean Award Lectures''. NY: MSS Information Corp.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, the same group of researchers created tools to look at systems that support development of resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garmezy | first1 = N. | last2 = Streitman | first2 = S. | year = 1974 | title = Children at risk: The search for the antecedents of schizophrenia. Part 1. Conceptual models and research methods | journal = Schizophrenia Bulletin | volume = 1 | issue = 8| pages = 14–90 | pmid = 4619494 | doi = 10.1093/schbul/1.8.14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emmy Werner]] was one of the early scientists to use the term ''resilience'' in the 1970s. She studied a cohort of children from [[Kauai]], Hawaii. Kauai was quite poor and many of the children in the study grew up with alcoholic or mentally ill parents. Many of the parents were also out of work.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, E. E. (1971). ''The children of Kauai : a longitudinal study from the prenatal period to age ten''. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|0870228609}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Werner noted that of the children who grew up in these detrimental situations, two-thirds exhibited destructive behaviors in their later teen years, such as chronic unemployment, substance abuse, and out-of-[[marriage|wedlock]] births (in case of teenage girls). However, one-third of these youngsters did not exhibit destructive behaviours. Werner called the latter group 'resilient'.&lt;ref name=w1989&gt;Werner, E. E. (1989). ''Vulnerable but invincible: a longitudinal study of resilient children and youth''. New York: McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0937431036}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, resilient children and their families were those who, by definition, demonstrated traits that allowed them to be more successful than non-resilient children and families.

Resilience also emerged as a major theoretical and research topic from the studies of children with mothers diagnosed with schizophrenia in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Masten, Best 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Masten | first1 = A. S. | last2 = Best | first2 = K. M. | last3 = Garmezy | first3 = N. | year = 1990 | title = Resilience and development: Contributions from the study of children who overcome adversity | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 425–444 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579400005812 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1989 study,&lt;ref&gt;Masten, A. S. (1989). "Resilience in development: Implications of the study of successful adaptation for developmental psychopathology". In D. Cicchetti (Ed.), ''The emergence of a discipline: Rochester symposium on developmental psychopathology'' (Vol. 1, pp. 261–294). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, {{ISBN|0805805532}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the results showed that children with a [[schizophrenic]] parent may not obtain an appropriate level of comforting caregiving—compared to children with healthy parents—and that such situations often had a detrimental impact on children's development. On the other hand, some children of ill parents thrived well and were competent in academic achievement, and therefore led researchers to make efforts to understand such responses to adversity.

Since the onset of the research on resilience, researchers have been devoted to discovering the protective factors that explain people's adaptation to adverse conditions, such as maltreatment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cicchetti | first1 = D. | last2 = Rogosch | first2 = F. A. | year = 1997 | title = The role of self-organization in the promotion of resilience in maltreated children | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 797–815 | pmid= 9449006 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579497001442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; catastrophic life events,&lt;ref name="Fredrickson, Tugade 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fredrickson | first1 = B.

S. (1999). ''Poverty and children's adjustment.'' Newbury Park, CA: Sage, {{ISBN|0761905189}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of empirical work then has been shifted to understand the underlying protective processes. Researchers endeavor to uncover how some factors (e.g. connection to family) may contribute to positive outcomes.&lt;ref name="Luthar 1999"/&gt;

==Process==

In all these instances, resilience is best understood as a process. It is often mistakenly assumed to be a trait of the individual, an idea more typically referred to as "resiliency".&lt;ref&gt;Masten, A.S. (1994). "Resilience in individual development: Successful adaptation despite risk and adversity", pp. 3–25 in M. Wang &amp; E. Gordon (Eds.), ''Risk and resilience in inner city America: challenges and prospects''. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, {{ISBN|080581325X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most research now shows that resilience is the result of individuals being able to interact with their environments and the processes that either promote well-being or protect them against the overwhelming influence of risk factors.&lt;ref name="Zautra, A.J. 2010 pp. 3-34"&gt;Zautra, A.J., Hall, J.S. &amp; Murray, K.E. (2010). "Resilience: A new definition of health for people and communities", pp. 3–34 in J.W. Reich, A.J. Zautra &amp; J.S. Hall (eds.), ''Handbook of adult resilience''. New York: Guilford, {{ISBN|146250647X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is essential to understand the process or this cycle of resiliency. When people are faced with an adverse condition, there are three ways in which they may approach the situation.

# Erupt with anger
# Implode with overwhelming negative emotions, go numb, and become unable to react
# Simply become upset about the disruptive change

Only the third approach promotes well-being. It is employed by resilient people, who become upset about the disruptive state and thus change their current pattern to cope with the issue. The first and second approaches lead people to adopt the victim role by [[projection (psychology)|blaming others]] and rejecting any coping methods even after the crisis is over. These people prefer to instinctively react, rather than respond to the situation. Those who respond to the adverse conditions by adapting themselves tend to cope, spring back, and halt the crisis. Negative emotions involve fear, anger, anxiety, distress, helplessness, and hopelessness which decrease a person's ability to solve the problems they face and weaken a person's resiliency. Constant fears and worries weaken people's immune system and increase their vulnerability to illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Siebert, Al (2005). ''The Resiliency Advantage'', pp. 2–4. Berrett-Koehler Publishers. {{ISBN|1576753298}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These processes include individual coping strategies, or may be helped by a protective environment like good [[family resilience|families]], schools, communities, and social policies that make resilience more likely to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, B., Dodgen, D. &amp; Solarz, A. (2005). "The resilience revolution: A paradigm shift for research and policy", pp. 47–63 in R.D. Peters, B. Leadbeater &amp; R.J. McMahon (eds.), ''Resilience in children, families, and communities: Linking context to practice and policy''. New York: Kluwer. {{ISBN|0306486555}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense "resilience" occurs when there are cumulative "protective factors". These factors are likely to play a more important role, the greater the individual's exposure to cumulative risk factors.

==Biological models==
Three notable bases for resilience—self-confidence, self-esteem and [[self-concept]]—all have roots in three different nervous systems—respectively, the [[somatic nervous system]], the [[autonomic nervous system]] and the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;Siebert, Al (2005). ''The Resiliency Advantage'', pp. 74–78. Berrett-Koehler Publishers. {{ISBN|1576753298}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An emerging field in the study of resilience is the neurobiological basis of resilience to stress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/339586/title/Brain_scan_foretells_who_will_fold_under_pressure Brain scan foretells who will fold under pressure; Tests on high-stakes math problems identify key regions of neural activity linked to choking], sciencenews.org (May 5, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and 5-Dehydroepiandrosterone (5-DHEA) are thought to limit the stress response by reducing sympathetic nervous system activation and protecting the brain from the potentially harmful effects of chronically elevated cortisol levels respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Charney|first1= DS |title=Psychobiological mechanisms of resilience and vulnerability: implications for successful adaptation to extreme stress |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=195–216 |year=2004 |pmid=14754765 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.2.195}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the relationship between social support and stress resilience is thought to be mediated by the oxytocin system's impact on the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=18627668| year=2008| last1=Ozbay| first1=F| last2=Fitterling| first2=H| last3=Charney| first3=D| last4=Southwick| first4=S| title=Social support and resilience to stress across ''the life'' span: A neurobiologic framework| volume=10| issue=4| pages=304–10| journal=Current Psychiatry Reports| doi=10.1007/s11920-008-0049-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Resilience, conceptualized as a positive bio-psychological adaptation, has proven to be a useful theoretical context for understanding variables for predicting long-term health and well-being".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Parental resilience: A neglected construct in resilience research|doi = 10.1111/cp.12053 | volume=19|issue=3|journal=Clinical Psychologist|pages=111–121|authors=Gavidia-Payne, S., Denny, B., Davis, K., Francis, A. and Jackson, M.|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some limited research that, like trauma, resilience is [[epigenetic]]—that is, it may be inherited—but the science behind this finding is preliminary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/05/28/trauma-may-be-woven-dna-native-americans-160508|work=Indian Country Today|title=Trauma May Be Woven in DNA of Native Americans|last=Pember|first=Mary Annette|date=May 28, 2015|accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related factors==

Studies show that there are several factors which develop and sustain a person's resilience:&lt;ref name="apa.org"&gt;American Psychological Association. (2014). [http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/road-resilience.aspx The Road to Resilience].&lt;/ref&gt;

# The ability to make realistic plans and being capable of taking the steps necessary to follow through with them
# Confidence in one's strengths and abilities
# Communication and problem-solving skills
# The ability to manage strong impulses and feelings

Resilience is negatively correlated with personality traits of neuroticism and negative emotionality, which represents tendencies to see and react to the world as threatening, problematic, and distressing, and to view oneself as vulnerable. Positive correlations stands with personality traits of openness and positive emotionality, that represents tendencies to engage and confront the world with confidence in success and a fair value to [[self-directedness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John W. Reich|author2=Alex J. Zautra|author3=John Stuart Hall|title=Handbook of Adult Resilience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lyRc8ZshU98C&amp;pg=PA114|year=2012|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-4625-0647-7|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positive emotions===

There is significant research found in scientific literature on the relationship between [[positive emotions]] and resilience. Studies show that maintaining positive emotions whilst facing adversity promote flexibility in thinking and problem solving. Positive emotions serve an important function in their ability to help an individual recover from stressful experiences and encounters. That being said, maintaining a positive emotionality aids in counteracting the physiological effects of negative emotions. It also facilitates adaptive coping, builds enduring social resources, and increases personal well-being.&lt;ref name="Fredrickson, B. L. 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 21852891 | pmc = 3156609 | year = 2005 | author1 = Fredrickson | first1 = B. L. | title = Positive emotions broaden the scope of attention and thought-action repertoires | journal = Cognition &amp; Emotion | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 313–332 | last2 = Branigan | first2 = C | doi = 10.1080/02699930441000238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formation of conscious perception and monitoring one's own socioemotional factors is considered as a stability aspect of positive emotions.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} This is not to say that positive emotions are merely a by-product of resilience, but rather that feeling positive emotions during stressful experiences may have adaptive benefits in the coping process of the individual.&lt;ref name=tugade&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 14769087 | pmc = 3132556 | year = 2004 | author1 = Tugade | first1 = M. M. | title = Resilient individuals use positive emotions to bounce back from negative emotional experiences | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 86 | issue = 2 | pages = 320–33 | last2 = Fredrickson | first2 = B. L. | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.86.2.320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical evidence for this prediction arises from research on resilient individuals who have a propensity for coping strategies that concretely elicit positive emotions, such as benefit-finding and cognitive reappraisal, humor, optimism, and goal-directed problem-focused coping. Individuals who tend to approach problems with these methods of coping may strengthen their resistance to stress by allocating more access to these positive emotional resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.91.4.730| pmid = 17014296| title = Psychological resilience, positive emotions, and successful adaptation to stress in later life| journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology| volume = 91| issue = 4| pages = 730–49| year = 2006| last1 = Ong | first1 = A. D. | last2 = Bergeman | first2 = C. S.| last3 = Bisconti | first3 = T. L. | last4 = Wallace | first4 = K. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social support from caring adults encouraged resilience among participants by providing them with access to conventional activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1111/fare.12134 | volume=64| issue=4|journal=Family Relations|pages=505–518| title=Examining Social Support Among Adult Children of Incarcerated Parents| year=2015| last1=Luther| first1=Kate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive emotions not only have physical outcomes but also physiological ones. Some physiological outcomes caused by humor include improvements in immune system functioning and increases in levels of salivary [[immunoglobulin A]], a vital system antibody, which serves as the body's first line of defense in respiratory illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00223980209604148| pmid = 12081092| title = Perceived Attributes of Health-Promoting Laughter: A Cross-Generational Comparison| journal = The Journal of Psychology| volume = 136| issue = 2| pages = 171–81| year = 2002| last1 = Mahony | first1 = D. L. | last2 = Burroughs | first2 = W. J. | last3 = Lippman | first3 = L. G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2190/R7FD-URN9-PQ7F-A6J7| title = Positive Emotional States and Enhancement of the Immune System| journal = The International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine| volume = 15| pages = 13–18| year = 1985| last1 = Baker | first1 = K. H. | last2 = Minchoff | first2 = B. | last3 = Dillon | first3 = K. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, other health outcomes include faster injury recovery rate and lower readmission rates to hospitals for the elderly, and reductions in a patient's stay in the hospital, among many other benefits. A study was done on positive emotions in trait-resilient individuals and the cardiovascular recovery rate following negative emotions felt by those individuals. The results of the study showed that trait-resilient individuals experiencing positive emotions had an acceleration in the speed in rebounding from cardiovascular activation initially generated by negative emotional arousal, i.e. heart rate and the like.&lt;ref name=tugade/&gt;

===Grit===
{{Main|Grit (personality trait)}}
Grit refers to the perseverance and passion for long-term goals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Duckworth|first1= A.L. |last2=Peterson|first2= C. |last3=Matthews|first3= M.D. |last4=Kelly|first4= D.R. |title= Grit: perseverance and passion for long-term goals. |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol|volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=11087–1101 |year=2007 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.6.1087}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is characterized as working persistently towards challenges, maintained effort and interest over years despite negative feedback, adversity, plateaus in progress, or failure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; High grit people view accomplishments as a marathon rather than an immediate goal. High grit individuals display a sustained and focused application of self in problematic situations than less gritty individuals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Grit affects the effort a person contributes by acting on the importance pathway. When people value a goal as more valuable, meaningful, or relevant to their self-concept they are willing to expend more effort on it when necessary. The influence of individual differences in grit results in different levels of effort-related cardiac activity when gritty and less gritty individuals performed the same task. Grit is associated with differences in potential motivation, one pathway in motivational intensity theory. Grit may also influence an individual's perception of task difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Silvia|first1= P.J. |last2=Eddington|first2= K.M. |last3=Beaty|first3= R.E. |last4=Nusbaum|first4= E.C. |last5=Kwapil|first5= T.R. |title= Gritty people try harder: grit and effort-related cardiac autonomic activity during an active coping challenge |journal=J Int J Psychophysiol|volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=200–205 |year=2013 |doi=10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2013.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grit was highly correlated with the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] [[conscientiousness]] trait.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Although grit and conscientiousness highly overlap in their achievement aspects, they differ in their emphasis. Grit emphasizes long-term stamina, whereas conscientiousness focuses on short-term intensity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Grit varies with level of education and age. More educated adults tend to be higher in grit than less educated individuals of the same age.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Post college graduates report higher grit levels than most other education level groups.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Grit increases with age when education level is controlled for.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In life achievements, grit may be as important as talent. College students at an elite university who scored high in grit also earned higher GPAs than their classmates, despite having lower SAT scores.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In a study at the West Point military academy it was found that grit was a more reliable predictor of first summer retention than self-control or a summary measure of cadet quality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Gritty competitors at the Scripps National Spelling Bee outranked other competitors who scored lower in grit, at least partially due to accumulated practice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Grit may also serve as a protective factor against [[suicide]]. A study at [[Stanford University]] found that grit was predictive of psychological health and well-being in medical residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salles|first1= A. |last2=Cohen|first2= G.L. |last3=Mueller|first3= C.M. |title= The relationship between grit and resident well-being|journal=Am J Surg|volume=207 |issue=2 |pages=251–254|year=2014 |doi=10.1016/j.amjsurg.2013.09.006|pmid= 24238604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gritty individuals possess self-control and regular commitment to goals that allows them to resist impulses, such as to engage in [[self-harm]]. Individuals high in grit also focus on future goals, which may stop them from attempting suicide. It is believed that because grit encourages individuals to create and sustain life goals, these goals provide meaning and purpose in life. Grit alone does not seem to be sufficient, however. Only individuals with high gratitude and grit have decreased suicidal ideation over long periods of time. Gratitude and grit work together to enhance meaning in life, offering protection against death and suicidal thoughts or plans.&lt;ref name=Kleinman&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kleinman|first1= E.M. |last2=Adams|first2= L.M. |last3=Kashdan|first3= T.B. |last4=Riskind|first4= J.H. |title= Gratitude and grit indirectly reduce risk of suicidal ideations by enhancing meaning in life: Evidence for a mediated moderation mode |journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=47 |issue=5 |pages=539–546|year=2013 |doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2013.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other factors===

A study was conducted among high achieving professionals who seek challenging situations that require resilience. Research has examined 13 high achievers from various professions, all of whom had experienced challenges in the workplace and negative life events over the course of their careers but who had also been recognized for their great achievements in their respective fields. Participants were interviewed about everyday life in the workplace as well as their experiences with resilience and thriving. The study found six main predictors of resilience: positive and proactive personality, experience and learning, sense of control, flexibility and adaptability, balance and perspective, and perceived social support. High achievers were also found to engage in many activities unrelated to their work such as engaging in hobbies, exercising, and organizing meetups with friends and loved ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/spy0000003| title = Ordinary magic, extraordinary performance: Psychological resilience and thriving in high achievers| journal = Sport, Exercise, and Performance Psychology| volume = 3| pages = 46–60| year = 2014| last1 = Sarkar | first1 = M. | last2 = Fletcher | first2 = D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several factors are found to modify the negative effects of adverse life situations. Many studies show that the primary factor for the development of resilience is social support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Theron|first=Linda|last2=van Rensburg|first2=Angelique|date=August 2018|title=Resilience over time: Learning from school-attending adolescents living in conditions of structural inequality|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140197118301052|journal=Journal of Adolescence|volume=67|pages=167–178|doi=10.1016/j.adolescence.2018.06.012|issn=0140-1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abraham 359–366"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abraham|first=Ruth|last2=Lien|first2=Lars|last3=Hanssen|first3=Ingrid|date=2018-03-27|title=Coping, resilience and posttraumatic growth among Eritrean female refugees living in Norwegian asylum reception centres: A qualitative study|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F0020764018765237|journal=International Journal of Social Psychiatry|language=en|volume=64|issue=4|pages=359–366|doi=10.1177/0020764018765237|issn=0020-7640}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gagnon|first=Anita J.|last2=Stewart|first2=Donna E.|date=2013-11-13|title=Resilience in international migrant women following violence associated with pregnancy|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00737-013-0392-5|journal=Archives of Women's Mental Health|language=en|volume=17|issue=4|pages=303–310|doi=10.1007/s00737-013-0392-5|issn=1434-1816}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many competing definitions of social support exist, most can be thought of as the degree of access to, and use of, strong ties to other individuals who are similar to one’s self.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Nan|last2=Woelfel|first2=Mary W.|last3=Light|first3=Stephen C.|date=September 1985|title=The Buffering Effect of Social Support Subsequent to an Important Life Event|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2136756|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|volume=26|issue=3|pages=247|doi=10.2307/2136756|issn=0022-1465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social support requires not only that you have relationships with others, but that these relationships involve the presence of solidarity and [[Trust (emotion)|trust]], intimate communication, and mutual obligation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perlin|first=L.|date=1981|title="The stress process."|url=|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|volume=22|pages=337–56|via=EbscoHost}}&lt;/ref&gt; both within and outside the [[family]].&lt;ref name="Abraham 359–366"/&gt; Additional factors are also associated with resilience, like the capacity to make realistic plans, having [[self-confidence]] and a positive [[self image]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elm|first1=Jessica|title="I'm in this world for a reason": Resilience and recovery among American Indian and Alaska Native two-spirit women|journal=Journal of Lesbian Studies|date=June 2016|volume=20|issue=3–4|pages=352–371|doi=10.1080/10894160.2016.1152813|pmid=27254761}}&lt;/ref&gt; developing [[communication skills training|communications skills]], and the capacity to manage strong feelings and [[impulse (psychology)|impulses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentsuccess.unc.edu/files/2015/08/The-Road-to-Resiliency.pdf |title=APA – Resilience Factors &amp; Strategies |publisher=unc.edu |accessdate=2010-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temperamental and constitutional disposition is considered as a major factor in resilience. It is one of the necessary precursors of resilience along with warmth in family cohesion and accessibility of prosocial support systems.&lt;ref&gt;Masten, A. S., &amp; Reed, M. G. (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Cr5rP8jOnsC&amp;pg=PA74 Resilience in development]. In C. R. Snyder, &amp; S. J. Lopez (Eds.), Handbook of positive psychology (pp. 74-88). London, England: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; There are three kinds of temperamental systems that play part in resilience, they are the appetitive system, defensive system and attentional system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=DERRYBERRY | first=DOUGLAS | last2=REED | first2=MARJORIE A. | last3=PILKENTON–TAYLOR | first3=CAROLYN | title=Temperament and coping: Advantages of an individual differences perspective | journal=Development and Psychopathology | publisher=Cambridge University Press (CUP) | volume=15 | issue=04 | date=14 November 2003 | issn=0954-5794 | doi=10.1017/s0954579403000439 | pmid=14984137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another protective factor is related to moderating the negative effects of environmental hazards or a stressful situation in order to direct vulnerable individuals to optimistic paths, such as external social support. More specifically a 1995 study distinguished three contexts for protective factors:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Werner | first1 = E. E. | year = 1995 | title = Resilience in development| journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 81–85 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8721.ep10772327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# personal attributes, including outgoing, bright, and positive [[self-concept]]s;
# the family, such as having close bonds with at least one family member or an emotionally stable parent; and
# the community, such as receiving support or counsel from peers.

Furthermore, a study of the elderly in Zurich, Switzerland, illuminated the role humor plays as a coping mechanism to maintain a state of happiness in the face of age-related adversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ruch | first1 = W. | last2 = Proyer | first2 = R. T. | last3 = Weber | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1007/s00391-009-0090-0 | title = Humor as a character strength among the elderly | journal = Zeitschrift für Gerontologie und Geriatrie | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–18 | year = 2009 | pmid = 20012063 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the above distinction on resilience, research has also been devoted to discovering the individual differences in resilience. [[Self-esteem]], ego-control, and ego-resiliency are related to behavioral adaptation.&lt;ref name=Ci1993&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cicchetti | first1 = D. | last2 = Rogosch | first2 = F. A. | last3 = Lynch | first3 = M. | last4 = Holt | first4 = K. D. | year = 1993 | title = Resilience in maltreated children: Processes leading to adaptive outcome | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 629–647 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579400006209 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, maltreated children who feel good about themselves may process risk situations differently by attributing different reasons to the environments they experience and, thereby, avoid producing negative [[internalized]] [[self-perception]]s. Ego-control is "the threshold or operating characteristics of an individual with regard to the expression or containment"&lt;ref&gt;Block, J. H., &amp; Block, J. (1980). "The role of ego-control and ego-resiliency in the organisation of behaviour". In W. A. Collins (Ed.), ''Development of cognition, affect, and social relations: Minnesota Symposia on Child Psychology '' (Vol. 13, p. 43). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, {{ISBN|089859023X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of their impulses, feelings, and desires. Ego-resilience refers to "dynamic capacity, to modify his or her model level of ego-control, in either direction, as a function of the demand characteristics of the environmental context"&lt;ref&gt;Block, J. H., &amp; Block, J. (1980). "The role of ego-control and ego-resiliency in the organisation of behaviour". In W. A. Collins (Ed.), ''Development of cognition, affect, and social relations: Minnesota Symposia on Child Psychology '' (Vol. 13, p. 48). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, {{ISBN|089859023X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maltreated children who experienced some risk factors (e.g., single parenting, limited maternal education, or family unemployment), showed lower ego-resilience and intelligence than nonmaltreated children. Furthermore, maltreated children are more likely than nonmaltreated children to demonstrate disruptive-aggressive, withdraw, and internalized behavior problems. Finally, ego-resiliency, and positive self-esteem were predictors of competent adaptation in the maltreated children.&lt;ref name=Ci1993/&gt;

Demographic information (e.g., gender) and resources (e.g., social support) are also used to predict resilience. Examining people's adaptation after disaster showed women were associated with less likelihood of resilience than men. Also, individuals who were less involved in affinity groups and organisations showed less resilience.&lt;ref name=Bonanno&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonanno | first1 = G. A. | last2 = Galea | first2 = S. | last3 = Bucciareli | first3 = A. | last4 = Vlahov | first4 = D. | year = 2007 | title = What predicts psychological resilience after disaster?

Certain aspects of religions and spirituality may, hypothetically, promote or hinder certain psychological virtues that increase resilience. Research has not established connection between spirituality and resilience. According to the 4th edition of ''Psychology of Religion'' by Hood, et al., the "study of positive psychology is a relatively new development...there has not yet been much direct empirical research looking specifically at the association of religion and ordinary strengths and virtues".&lt;ref&gt;Hood, R., Hill, P., Spilka, B., (2009) ''The psychology of religion, 4th edition: An empirical approach''. Newyork: The Guilford press, {{ISBN|1606233920}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of the literature on the relationship between religiosity/spirituality and PTSD, amongst the significant findings, about half of the studies showed a positive relationship and half showed a negative relationship between measures of religiosity/spirituality and resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peres | first1 = J. | last2 = Moreira-Almeida | first2 = A. | last3 = Nasello | first3 = A. | last4 = Koenig | first4 = H. | year = 2007 | title = Spirituality and resilience in trauma victims | journal = Journal of Religion &amp; Health | volume = 46 | issue = 3| pages = 343–350 | doi = 10.1007/s10943-006-9103-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Army has received criticism for promoting spirituality in its new [Comprehensive Soldier Fitness] program as a way to prevent PTSD, due to the lack of conclusive supporting data.

In military studies it has been found that resilience is also dependent on group support: unit cohesion and morale is the best predictor of combat resiliency within a unit or organization. Resilience is highly correlated to peer support and group cohesion. Units with high cohesion tend to experience a lower rate of psychological breakdowns than units with low cohesion and morale. High cohesion and morale enhance adaptive stress reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Army (2009). Field Manual No. 6-22.5. Combat and Operational Stress Control Manual for Leaders and Soldiers. Department of the Army Headquarters, Washington, DC, 18 March 2009. p 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==

In [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], building resilience is a matter of mindfully changing basic behaviors and thought patterns.&lt;ref name="Padesky"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Padesky|first=Christine A.|last2=Mooney|first2=Kathleen A.|date=2012-06-01|title=Strengths-Based Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy: A Four-Step Model to Build Resilience|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpp.1795|journal=Clinical Psychology &amp; Psychotherapy|language=en|volume=19|issue=4|pages=283–290|doi=10.1002/cpp.1795|issn=1063-3995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first step is to change the nature of self-talk. Self-talk is the internal monologue people have that reinforce beliefs about the person's self-efficacy and self-value. To build resilience, the person needs to eliminate negative self-talk, such as "I can't do this" and "I can't handle this", and to replace it with positive self-talk, such as "I can do this" and "I can handle this". This small change in thought patterns helps to reduce psychological stress when a person is faced with a difficult challenge. The second step a person can take to build resilience is to be prepared for challenges, crises, and emergencies. In business, preparedness is created by creating emergency response plans, business continuity plans, and contingency plans. For personal preparedness, the individual can create a financial cushion to help with economic crises, he/she can develop social networks to help him/her through trying personal crises, and he/she can develop emergency response plans for his/her household.

Resilience is also enhanced by developing effective coping skills for stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chua|first=Li Wen|last2=Milfont|first2=Taciano L.|last3=Jose|first3=Paul E.|date=2014-11-27|title=Coping Skills Help Explain How Future-Oriented Adolescents Accrue Greater Well-Being Over Time|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-014-0230-8|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|language=en|volume=44|issue=11|pages=2028–2041|doi=10.1007/s10964-014-0230-8|issn=0047-2891}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coping skills help the individual to reduce stress levels, so they remain functional. Coping skills include using meditation, exercise, socialization, and self-care practices to maintain a healthy level of stress, but there are many other lists associated with psychological resilience.

The [[American Psychological Association]] suggests "10 Ways to Build Resilience",&lt;ref name="apa.org" /&gt; which are:

# to maintain good [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s with close family members, friends and others;
# to avoid seeing [[crisis|crises]] or [[Stress (biology)|stressful]] events as unbearable problems;
# to accept circumstances that cannot be changed;
# to develop realistic [[goal]]s and move towards them;
# to take decisive actions in adverse situations;
# to look for opportunities of self-discovery after a struggle with loss;
# to develop self-confidence;
# to keep a long-term perspective and consider the stressful event in a broader context;
# to maintain a hopeful outlook, expecting good things and [[Mental image|visualizing]] what is wished;
# to take care of one's [[mind]] and [[Human body|body]], [[physical exercise|exercising]] regularly, paying attention to one's own needs and feelings.

The Besht model of natural resilience building in an ideal family with positive access and support from family and friends, through parenting illustrates four key markers. They are:

# Realistic upbringing
# Effective risk communications
# Positivity and restructuring of demanding situations
# Building self efficacy and hardiness

In this model, [[self-efficacy]] is the belief in one's ability to organize and execute the courses of action required to achieve necessary and desired goals and [[Hardiness (psychological)|hardiness]] is a composite of interrelated attitudes of commitment, control, and challenge.

A number of self-help approaches to resilience-building have been developed, drawing mainly on the theory and practice of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) and [[rational emotive behavior therapy]] (REBT).&lt;ref name="Robertson_2012"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Robertson, D | title=Build your Resilience| year=2012| publisher=Hodder| location=London| isbn=978-1444168716|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwIstsEgkBMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a group cognitive-behavioral intervention, called the Penn Resiliency Program (PRP), has been shown to foster various aspects of resilience. A meta-analysis of 17 PRP studies showed that the intervention significantly reduces depressive symptoms over time.&lt;ref name="pmid19968381"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brunwasser SM, Gillham JE, Kim ES.|title=A meta-analytic review of the Penn Resiliency Program's effect on depressive symptoms|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|year=2009|volume=77|issue=6|pages=1042–1054|doi=10.1037/a0017671|pmid=19968381|last2=Gillham|last3=Kim|pmc=4667774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of 'resilience building' is debatably at odds with the concept of resilience as a process,&lt;ref name="Rutter, M. 2008 pp. 3"&gt;Rutter, M. (2008). "Developing concepts in developmental psychopathology", pp. 3–22 in J.J. Hudziak (ed.), ''Developmental psychopathology and wellness: Genetic and environmental influences''. Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Publishing, {{ISBN|1585622796}}.&lt;/ref&gt; since it is used to imply that it is a developable characteristic of oneself.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Masten | first1 = A.

[[Bibliotherapy]], positive tracking of events, and enhancing psychosocial protective factors with positive psychological resources are other methods for resilience building.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, T. M., Egeland, B., &amp; Sroufe, L. A. (2003). "Rethinking resilience: A developmental process perspective", pp. 234–256 in S. S. Luthar (Ed.), ''Resilience and vulnerability: Adaptation in the context of childhood adversities''. New York: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521001617}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, increasing an individual's resources to cope with or otherwise address the negative aspects of risk or adversity is promoted, or builds, resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Resilience: Building immunity in psychiatry | pmc=3777343 | pmid=24082242 | doi=10.4103/0019-5545.117134 | volume=55 | issue=3 | year=2013 | journal=Indian J Psychiatry | pages=224–34 | last1 = Shastri | first1 = PC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrasting research finds that strategies to regulate and control emotions, in order to enhance resilience, allows for better outcomes in the event of mental illness.&lt;ref name=Min&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.comppsych.2013.05.008| pmid = 23806709| title = Cognitive emotion regulation strategies contributing to resilience in patients with depression and/or anxiety disorders| journal = Comprehensive Psychiatry| volume = 54| issue = 8| pages = 1190–7| year = 2013| last1 = Min | first1 = J.

H. }}&lt;/ref&gt; While initial studies of resilience originated with developmental scientists studying children in high-risk environments, a study on 230 adults diagnosed with depression and anxiety that emphasized emotional regulation, showed that it contributed to resilience in patients. These strategies focused on planning, positively reappraising events, and reducing rumination helped in maintaining a healthy continuity.&lt;ref name=Min/&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2016}} Patients with improved resilience were found to yield better treatment outcomes than patients with non-resilience focused treatment plans,&lt;ref name=Min/&gt; providing potential information for supporting evidence based psychotherapeutic interventions that may better handle mental disorders by focusing on the aspect of psychological resilience.

Military organizations test personnel for the ability to function under stressful circumstances by deliberately subjecting them to stress during training. Those students who do not exhibit the necessary resilience can be screened out of the training. Those who remain can be given stress inoculation training.

==Children==

Resilience in children refers to individuals who are doing better than expected, given a history that includes risk or adverse experience. Once again, it is not a trait or something that some children simply possess. There is no such thing as an 'invulnerable child' that can overcome any obstacle or adversity that he or she encounters in life—and in fact, the trait is quite common.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Resilience is the product of a number of developmental processes over time, that has allowed children experience small exposures to adversity or some sort of age appropriate challenges to develop mastery and continue to develop competently.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, T. M., Egeland, B., &amp; Sroufe, L. A. (2003). "Rethinking resilience: A developmental process perspective", pp. 234–256 in S. S. Luthar (Ed.), ''Resilience and vulnerability: Adaptation in the context of childhood adversities''. New York: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521001617}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This gives children a sense of personal pride and self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steven J.

Research on 'protective factors', which are characteristics of children or situations that particularly help children in the context of risk has helped developmental scientists to understand what matters most for resilient children. Two of these that have emerged repeatedly in studies of resilient children are good cognitive functioning (like cognitive self-regulation and IQ) and positive relationships (especially with competent adults, like parents).&lt;ref&gt;Luthar, S. S. (2006). "Resilience in development: A synthesis of research across five decades", pp. 739–795 in D. Cicchetti and D. J. Cohen (Eds.), ''Developmental Psychopathology (2nd ed.): Vol. 3 Risk, Disorder, and Adaptation''. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Children who have protective factors in their lives tend to do better in some risky contexts when compared to children without protective factors in the same contexts. However, this is not a justification to expose any child to risk. Children do better when not exposed to high levels of risk or adversity.

===Building in the classroom===

Resilient children within classroom environments have been described as working and playing well and holding high expectations, have often been characterized using constructs such as [[locus of control]], [[self-esteem]], [[self-efficacy]], and [[autonomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Garmezy, N. (1974, August) ''The study of children at risk: New perspectives for developmental psychopathology.''&lt;/ref&gt; All of these things work together to prevent the debilitating behaviors that are associated with [[learned helplessness]].

===Role of the community===
Communities play a huge role in fostering resilience. The clearest sign of a cohesive and supportive community is the presence of social organizations that provide healthy human development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garmezy | first1 = N. | year = 1991 | title = Resiliency and vulnerability to adverse developmental outcomes associated with poverty | journal = American Behavioral Scientist | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 416–430 | doi = 10.1177/0002764291034004003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Services are unlikely to be used unless there is good communication concerning them. Children who are repeatedly [[Relocation (personal)|relocated]] do not benefit from these resources, as their opportunities for resilience-building, meaningful community participation are removed with every relocation.&lt;ref name="Emotional Adjustment of Moving for Young Kids"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moveboxer.com/content/pages/the-emotional-adjustment-of-moving-for-young-kids|title=Emotional Adjustment of Moving for Young Kids|last=Howard|first=Alyssa|publisher=Moveboxer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of the family===

Fostering resilience in children requires family environments that are caring and stable, hold high expectations for children's behavior and encourage participation in the life of the family.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Haertel, &amp; Walberg, M. C., G. D., &amp; H. J (Ed.). (1994). ''Educational Resilience in Inner Cities.'' Hillsdale, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Most resilient children have a strong relationship with at least one adult, not always a parent, and this relationship helps to diminish risk associated with family discord. The definition of parental resilience, as the capacity of parents to deliver a competent and quality level of parenting to children, despite the presence of risk factors, has proven to be a very important role in children's resilience. Understanding the characteristics of quality parenting is critical to the idea of parental resilience.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Even if divorce produces stress, the availability of social support from family and community can reduce this stress and yield positive outcomes.&lt;ref name="Benard, B. 1991"&gt;Benard, B. (1991) [https://archive.org/details/fosteringresilie00benarich ''Fostering resiliency in kids: Protective factors in the family, school and community.''] Portland, OR: Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; Any family that emphasizes the value of assigned chores, caring for brothers or sisters, and the contribution of part-time work in supporting the family helps to foster resilience.&lt;ref name=w1989/&gt; Resilience research has traditionally focused on the well being of children, with limited academic attention paid to factors that may contribute to the resilience of parents.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Families in poverty===
Numerous studies have shown that some practices that poor parents utilize help promote resilience within families. These include frequent displays of warmth, affection, emotional support; reasonable expectations for children combined with straightforward, not overly harsh discipline; family routines and celebrations; and the maintenance of common values regarding money and leisure.&lt;ref&gt;Cauce, Ana Mari; Stewart, Angela; Rodriguez, Melanie D.; Cochran, Bryan; Ginzler, Joshua. (2003) "Overcoming the Odds? Adolescent Development in the Context of Urban Poverty", pp. 343–391 in Suniya S. Luthar (ed.), ''Resilience and Vulnerability: Adaptation in the Context of Childhood Adversities''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521001617}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to sociologist Christopher B. Doob, "Poor children growing up in resilient families have received significant support for doing well as they enter the social world—starting in daycare programs and then in schooling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doob|first=Christopher B.|title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society|year=2013|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bullying===
{{Main|Bullying and emotional intelligence#Resilience}}

Beyond preventing [[bullying]], it is also important to consider how interventions based on emotional intelligence (EI) are important in the case that bullying does occur. Increasing EI may be an important step in trying to foster resilience among victims. When a person faces stress and adversity, especially of a repetitive nature, their ability to adapt is an important factor in whether they have a more positive or negative outcome.&lt;ref name=Brisa&gt;Monroy Cortés, B. G. &amp; Palacios Cruz, L. (2011) [http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=58220785008 Resiliencia: ¿Es posible medirla e influir en ella?] ''Salud Mental'', ''34''(3) 237–246. México: Instituto Nacional de Psiquiátrica Ramón de la Fuente Muñiz. {{ISSN|0185-3325}} [Spanish]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study examined adolescents who illustrated resilience to bullying and found some interesting gendered differences, with higher behavioral resilience found among girls and higher emotional resilience found among boys. Despite these differences, they still implicated internal resources and negative emotionality in either encouraging or being negatively associated with resilience to bullying respectively and urged for the targeting of psychosocial skills as a form of intervention.&lt;ref name=Sapouna&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.chiabu.2013.05.009| title = Resilience to bullying victimization: The role of individual, family and peer characteristics| journal = Child Abuse &amp; Neglect| volume = 37| issue = 11| pages = 997–1006| year = 2013| last1 = Sapouna | first1 = M. | last2 = Wolke | first2 = D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emotional intelligence]] has been illustrated to promote resilience to stress&lt;ref name=Schneider&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2013.07.460| title = Emotional intelligence and resilience| journal = Personality and Individual Differences| volume = 55| issue = 8| pages = 909–914| year = 2013| last1 = Schneider | first1 = T.

(2013) found that emotional perception was significant in facilitating lower negative emotionality during stress and Emotional Understanding facilitated resilience and has a positive correlation with positive affect.&lt;ref name=Schneider /&gt;

==Studies in specific populations and causal situations==

===Affected populations===

====Among transgender youth====

Transgender youth experience a wide range of abuse and lack of understanding from the people in their environment and are better off with a high resilience to deal with their lives. A study was done looking at 55 transgender youths studying their sense of personal mastery, perceived social support, emotion-oriented coping and self-esteem. It was seen that around 50% of the variation in the resilience aspects accounted for the problematic issues of the teens. This means that transgender youths with lower resilience were more prone to mental health issues, including depression and trauma symptoms. Emotion-oriented coping was a strong aspect of resilience in determining how depressed the individuals were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aspects of Psychological Resilience among Transgender Youth|journal=LGBT Youth|date=8 April 2011|volume=8|issue=2|pages=103–115|doi=10.1080/19361653.2011.541347|last1=Grossman|first1=Arnold H.|last2=d'Augelli|first2=Anthony R.|last3=Frank|first3=John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among pregnant adolescents and depressive symptoms====

Pregnancies among adolescents are considered as a complication, as they favour education interruption, poor present and future health, higher rates of poverty, problems for present and future children, among other negative outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Pérez-López FR, Chedraui P, Kravitz AS, Salazar-Pousada D, Hidalgo L |title= Present problems and controversies concerning pregnant adolescents|journal= Open Access Journal of Contraception |year=2011|volume=2 |pages=85–94|url= http://www.unizar.es/gine/adol.pdf|doi=10.2147/OAJC.S13398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators from the Ecuadorian Catholic University ([[Universidad Católica de Santiago de Guayaquil]]) (Guayaquil) and the Spanish [[University of Zaragoza]] (Zaragoza), performed a comparative study at the Enrique C. Sotomayor Obstetric and Gynecology Hospital (Guayaquil) assessing resilience differences between pregnant [[adolescents]] and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Salazar-Pousada | first1 = D. | last2 = Arroyo | first2 = D. | last3 = Hidalgo | first3 = L. | last4 = Pérez-López | first4 = F. R. | last5 = Chedraui | first5 = P. | title = Depressive Symptoms and Resilience among Pregnant Adolescents: A Case-Control Study | doi = 10.1155/2010/952493 | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology International | volume = 2010 | pages = 1–7 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21461335 | pmc =3065659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 56.6% of gravids presented total CESD-10 scores 10 or more indicating depressed mood. Despite this, total CESD-10 scores and depressed mood rate did not differ among studied groups. Adolescents did, however, display lower resilience reflected by lower total resilience scores and a higher rate of scores below the calculated median (P &lt; 0.05). Logistic regression analysis could not establish any risk factor for depressed mood among studied subjects; however, having an adolescent partner and a preterm delivery related to a higher risk for lower resilience.

===Causal situations===

====Divorce====

Oftentimes divorce is viewed as detrimental to one's emotional health, but studies have shown that cultivating resilience may be beneficial to all parties involved. The level of resilience a child will experience after their parents have split is dependent on both internal and external variables. Some of these variables include their psychological and physical state and the level of support they receive from their schools, friends, and family friends.&lt;ref name="Hopf S.M 2010"/&gt; The ability to deal with these situations also stems from the child's age, gender, and temperament. Children will experience divorce differently and thus their ability to cope with divorce will differ too. About 20–25% of children will "demonstrate severe emotional and behavioral problems" when going through a divorce.&lt;ref name="Hopf S.M 2010"/&gt; This percentage is notably higher than the 10% of children exhibiting similar problems in married families.&lt;ref name="Kelly J, Emery R 2003 352–362"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1741-3729.2003.00352.x| title = Children's Adjustment Following Divorce: Risk and Resilience Perspectives| journal = Family Relations| volume = 52| issue = 4| pages = 352–362| year = 2003| last1 = Kelly | first1 = J. B. | last2 = Emery | first2 = R. E. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having divorces parents of approximately 75–80% of these children will "develop into well-adjusted adults with no lasting psychological or behavioral problems". This comes to show that most children have the tools necessary to allow them to exhibit the resilience needed to overcome their parents' divorce.

The effects of the divorce extend past the separation of both parents. The remaining conflict between parents, financial problems, and the re-partnering or remarriage of parents can cause lasting stress.&lt;ref name="Hopf S.M 2010"/&gt; Studies conducted by Booth and Amato (2001) have shown that there is no correlation between post-divorce conflict and the child's ability to adjust to their life circumstance.&lt;ref name="Kelly J, Emery R 2003 352–362"/&gt; On the other hand, Hetherington (1999) completed research on this same topic and did find adverse effects in children.&lt;ref name="Kelly J, Emery R 2003 352–362"/&gt; In regards to the financial standing of a family, divorce does have the potential to reduce the children's style of living. Child support is often given to help cover basic needs such as schooling. If the parents' finances are already scarce then their children may not be able to participate in extracurricular activities such as sports and music lessons, which can be detrimental to their social lives.

Repartnering or remarrying can bring in additional levels of conflict and anger into their home environment. One of the reasons that re-partnering causes additional stress is because of the lack of clarity in roles and relationships; the child may not know how to react and behave with this new "parent" figure in their life. In most cases, bringing in a new partner/spouse will be the most stressful when done shortly after the divorce. In the past, divorce had been viewed as a "single event", but now research shows that divorce encompasses multiple changes and challenges.&lt;ref name="Kelly J, Emery R 2003 352–362"/&gt; It is not only internal factors that allow for resiliency, but the external factors in the environment are critical for responding to the situation and adapting. Certain programs such as the 14-week Children's Support Group and the Children of Divorce Intervention Program may help a child cope with the changes that occur from a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.childrensinstitute.net/sites/default/files/documents/children-resilience-family-court-review.pdf|author=Pedro-Carroll, JA |title= Fostering children's resilience in the aftermath of divorce: The told of evidence based programs for children|journal= Family Court Review|volume=43|year=2005|pages=52–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Natural disasters====
Resilience after a natural disaster can be gauged in a number of different ways. It can be gauged on an individual level, a community level, and on a physical level. The first level, the individual level, can be defined as each independent person in the community. The second level, the community level, can be defined as all those inhabiting the locality affected. Lastly, the physical level can be defined as the infrastructure of the locality affected.&lt;ref name="ecologyandsociety.org"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.5751/ES-05377-180216|title=Education, Vulnerability, and Resilience after a Natural Disaster|journal=Ecology and Society|volume=18|issue=2|year=2013|last1=Frankenberg|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Sikoki|first2=Bondan|last3=Sumantri|first3=Cecep|last4=Suriastini|first4=Wayan|last5=Thomas|first5=Duncan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNESCAP funded research on how communities show resiliency in the wake of natural disasters.&lt;ref name="unescap.org"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Theme Study on Building Resilience to Natural Disasters and Major Economic Crises|journal= Welcome to UN ESCAP. |url= http://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/ThemeStudy2013-full2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that, physically, communities were more resilient if they banded together and made resiliency an effort of the whole community.&lt;ref name="unescap.org"/&gt; Social support is key in resilient behavior, and especially the ability to pool resources.&lt;ref name="unescap.org"/&gt; In pooling social, natural, and economic resources, they found that communities were more resilient and able to over come disasters much faster than communities with an individualistic mindset.&lt;ref name="unescap.org"/&gt;

The World Economic Forum met in 2014 to discuss resiliency after natural disasters. They conclude that countries that are more economically sound, and have more individuals with the ability to diversify their livelihoods, will show higher levels of resiliency.&lt;ref name="weforum.org"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Building Resilience to Natural Disasters|journal= The World Economic Forum. |url= http://www.weforum.org/sessions/summary/building-resilience-natural-disasters-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has not been studied in depth yet, but the ideas brought about through this forum appear to be fairly consistent with already existing research.&lt;ref name="weforum.org"/&gt;

====Death of a family member====

Little research has been done on the topic of family resilience in the wake of the death of a family member.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rynearson, Edward K. |title=Violent Death: Resilience and Intervention Beyond the Crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WoRCPUeylLYC&amp;pg=PP1|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-135-92633-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, clinical attention to bereavement has focused on the individual mourning process rather than on those of the family unit as a whole. Resiliency is distinguished from recovery as the "ability to maintain a stable equilibrium"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bonanno|first1=George A.|title=Loss, Trauma, and Human Resilience|journal=American Psychologist|volume=59|issue=1|pages=20–8|pmid=14736317|year=2004|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is conducive to balance, harmony, and recovery. Families must learn to manage familial distortions caused by the death of the family member, which can be done by reorganizing relationships and changing patterns of functioning to adapt to their new situation.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Greeff|first1=Abraham P.|last2=Human|first2=Berquin|title=Resilience in families in which a parent has died|journal=The American Journal of Family Therapy|volume=32|pages=27–42|doi=10.1080/01926180490255765|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibiting resilience in the wake of trauma can successfully traverse the bereavement process without long-term negative consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2190/OM.61.1.b| title = Reactions to Loss Scale: Assessing Grief in College Students| journal = OMEGA – Journal of Death and Dying| volume = 61| pages = 25–51| year = 2010| last1 = Cooley | first1 = E.| last2 = Toray | first2 = T.| last3 = Roscoe | first3 = L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the healthiest behaviors displayed by resilient families in the wake of a death is honest and open communication. This facilitates an understanding of the crisis. Sharing the experience of the death can promote immediate and long-term adaptation to the recent loss of a loved one. Empathy is a crucial component in resilience because it allows mourners to understand other positions, tolerate conflict, and be ready to grapple with differences that may arise. Another crucial component to resilience is the maintenance of a routine that helps to bind the family together through regular contact and order. The continuation of education and a connection with peers and teachers at school is an important support for children struggling with the death of a family member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Therapeutic Interventions to Strengthen Resilience in Vulnerable Children|journal=School Psychology International|volume=35|issue=3|pages=309–337|doi=10.1177/0143034314529912|year=2014|last1=Heath|first1=M. A.|last2=Donald|first2=D. R.|last3=Theron|first3=L. C.|last4=Lyon|first4=R. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Brad Evans and Julian Reid criticize resilience discourse and its rising popularity in their book, ''Resilient Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=Brad|last2=Reid|first2=Julian|title=Resilient Life: The Art of Living Dangerously|date=2014|publisher=Polity Press|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-0-7456-7152-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors assert that policies of resilience can put the onus of disaster response on individuals rather than publicly coordinated efforts. Tied to the emergence of [[neoliberalism]], [[climate change]] theory, third-world development, and other discourses, Evans and Reid argue that promoting resilience draws attention away from governmental responsibility and towards self-responsibility and healthy psychological affects such as "posttraumatic growth".

Another criticism regarding resilience is its definition. Like other psychological phenomena, by defining specific psychological and affective states in certain ways, controversy over meaning will always ensue. How the term resilience is defined affects research focuses; different or insufficient definitions of resilience will lead to inconsistent research about the same concepts. Research on resilience has become more heterogeneous in its outcomes and measures, convincing some researchers to abandon the term altogether due to it being attributed to all outcomes of research where results were more positive than expected.&lt;ref name=burt&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0954579412000119| pmid = 22559126| title = Resilience in the transition to adulthood| journal = Development and Psychopathology| volume = 24| issue = 2| pages = 493–505| year = 2012| last1 = Burt | first1 = K. B. | last2 = Paysnick | first2 = A. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Qinling panda''' (''Ailuropoda melanoleuca qinlingensis'') is a subspecies of the [[giant panda]], discovered in the 1960s{{Citation needed|reason=Sources don't seem to mention anything about it being discovered in 1960s.|date=July 2017}} but not recognized as a subspecies until 2005.&lt;ref name=Zhang&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Baowei|last2=Li|first2=Ming|last3=Zhang|first3=Zejun|last4=Goossens|first4=Benoît|last5=Zhu|first5=Lifeng|last6=Zhang|first6=Shanning|last7=Hu|first7=Jinchu|last8=Bruford|first8=Michael W.|last9=Wei|first9=Fuwen|title=Genetic Viability and Population History of the Giant Panda, Putting an End to the 'Evolutionary Dead End'?|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|date=2007|volume=24|issue=8|pages=1801–1810|doi=10.1093/molbev/msm099|pmid=17513881|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cascn"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cas.cn/xw/kjsm/gndt/200502/t20050215_1000599.shtml | script-title=zh:秦岭大熊猫被确认为新亚种|trans-title=Qinling panda recognized as new subspecies | publisher=Chinese Academy of Sciences | date=15 February 2005|language=Chinese | accessdate=June 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disregarding the [[nominate subspecies]], it is the first giant panda subspecies to be recognized. It differs from the more familiar nominate subspecies by its smaller skull and dark brown and light brown (rather than black and white) fur, and its smaller overall size.&lt;ref name="Wan"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Qiu-Hong Wan|author2=Hua Wu|author3=Sheng-Guo Fang |year=2005 |title=A new subspecies of giant panda (''Ailuropoda melanoleuca'') from Shaanxi, China |journal=[[Journal of Mammalogy]] |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=397–402 |jstor=4094359 |doi=10.1644/BRB-226.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are an estimated 200–300 Qinling pandas living in the wild.&lt;ref name="Wan" /&gt;
On August 30, 1989, a female of this species was captured and brought to the [[Xi'an Zoo]] to be mated with a regular giant panda. Her offspring was black-and-white, but reportedly started becoming brownish as it aged.  According to other reports she gave birth to three cubs but all of whom died shortly after being born. The mother, named Dan-Dan, died in 2000.&lt;ref name=mesbeast&gt;{{cite web|title=Sepia Giant Panda|url=http://www.messybeast.com/extinct/sepia-giant-panda.htm|accessdate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This subspecies is restricted to the [[Qinling Mountains]], at elevations of {{convert|1300|-|3000|m}}. Its coloration is possibly a consequence of [[inbreeding]]: as the population is closed off from [[genetic variation]] and this might have led to the preservation of the [[mutation]] responsible.&lt;ref name = Zhang /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wan"/&gt;

Due to the Qinling subspecies being captive it has been exposed to toxicants in their bamboo diet. Even though it is not fully known what toxicants it has been exposed it is determined that it was heavy metal from the atmospheric deposition. Thus, the conservation of the Qinling pandas may be compromised in the future due to the issues of air pollution of China.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Yi‐ping, et al. “Atmospheric Deposition Exposes Qinling Pandas to Toxic Pollutants.” ''Ecology'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2 Mar. 2017, esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/eap.1494.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerard McManus]] and Michael Harvey were journalists at the [[Herald Sun]] newspaper in Melbourne in the state of Victoria, Australia. In June 2007 the pair were convicted of contempt of court for refusing to name the source of an exposé the pair wrote on war veterans’ entitlements.

The pair’s conviction prompted a widespread debate on journalistic freedom in Australia and resulted in federal and state governments introducing “[[Shield laws in the United States|shield laws]]” to give judges scope to exempt journalists from revealing their sources during trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dixon|first=Nicolee|title=The Pivotal Case of R v McManus and Harvey|url=http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/documents/explore/ResearchPublications/ResearchBriefs/2012/RBR201203.pdf|work=Shield Laws for Journalists|publisher=Queensland Parliamentary Library and Research Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

A February 2004 Herald Sun report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cabinet’s $500m rebuff revealed|url=http://www.newsawards.com.au/files/pdf/07/chairman4.pdf|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=20 February 2004|author=Michael Harvey|author2=Gerard McManus|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by Harvey and McManus revealed an Australian Federal Government decision to rebuff 60 recommendations for improved financial benefits for returned war servicemen and women, including subsidized funeral costs, while still planning to portray the scaled-down support as a boon for war veterans and widows.

The story prompted a large-scale investigation into the possible source inside the [[Australian Public Service]] including [[Australian Federal Police]] probing 3,000 telephone extensions and hundreds of mobile phones. However, McManus and Harvey refused to disclose to the Australian Federal Police their source, citing adherence to journalists “Code of Ethics”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Alliance Code of Ethics|url=http://www.alliance.org.au/code-of-ethics.html|publisher=Media, Entertainment &amp; Arts Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Failure to Give Evidence ==

A civil servant, Desmond Patrick Kelly, was subsequently charged with a breach of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, but at a pre-trial hearing in August 2005 McManus and Harvey refused to give evidence. Nevertheless, Kelly was still found guilty of leaking confidential material, but in October 2006 the Victorian Court of Appeal overturned the conviction finding there was insufficient evidence to prove that he was the person who leaked the information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VSCA|221|2006|litigants=R v Kelly |date=17 October 2006 |courtname=[[Supreme Court of Victoria|Court of Appeal]] (Victoria)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bureaucrat's conviction for leaking info overturned|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-10-17/bureaucrats-conviction-for-leaking-info-overturned/1287986|newspaper=ABC News|date=17 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the McManus-Harvey contempt matter continued and on 25 June 2007 McManus was found guilty of five counts of contempt of court and Harvey was found guilty of four counts. Victorian County Court Chief Judge [[Michael Rozenes]] said the offence was a serious one and that he had considered incarcerating the pair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Queen v Desmond Kelly (Transcript of Proceedings)|url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/img/2005/ep26/proceedings.pdf|page=89|date=23 August 2005|quote=Bearing in mind the nature of this proceeding there would be a range of penalties available, but I think no one should be under any misapprehension that prison is one of them.}}&lt;/ref&gt; McManus and Harvey were each fined $7,000, and a conviction recorded against them. [[News Limited]] supported the pair throughout the hearings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hartigan|first=John|title=Australia's Right to Know|url=http://www.australiasrighttoknow.com.au/files/J-Hartigan-ARTK-Conference-Speech.pdf|work=Speech at Freedom of Speech Conference|date=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other media groups, the [[Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ester|first=Helen|title=Silencing Dissent|year=2007|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|url=http://newmatilda.com/2007/02/14/leak-squad|editor1=Clive Hamilton|editor2=Sarah Maddison|quote=Federal Secretary of the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA) Chris Warren described the charging of McManus and Harvey as 'a train wreck waiting to happen'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breaking the shackles the continuing fight against censorship and spin|url=http://www.alliance.org.au/documents/press_freedom_report08.pdf|work=2008 report into the state of press freedom in Australia|publisher=The Media, Entertainment &amp; Arts Alliance|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Australian Press Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Submission to Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee - Inquiry into the Evidence Amendment (Journalists' Privilege) Bill 2010 (No. 1 and No.2)|url=http://www.presscouncil.org.au/document-search/senate-legal-and-constitutional-affairs-legislation-committee-inquiry-into-the-evidence-amendment-journalists-privilege-bill-2010-and-the-evidence-amendment-journalists-privilege-bill-2010-no-2/|author=Australian Press Council|date=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction to the Case ==

The ensuing outcry from the McManus and Harvey convictions prompted both the [[Howard Government|John Howard]] and [[First Rudd Government|Kevin Rudd]] Governments to introduce laws to provide some level of protection for journalists regarding their sources in 2007 and 2009. However, both administrations fell before the proposed laws were passed.

== Shield Laws ==

Tasmanian independent member of the House of Representatives, [[Andrew Wilkie]], and Queensland Liberal Senator [[George Brandis]]   respectively introduced [[Private member’s bill|Private Member’s Bills]] in 2009 to provide greater protection for journalists and their sources. Both Bills were referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parliamentary Inquiry into the Evidence Amendment (Journalists’ Privilege) Bill 2009|url=http://www.presscouncil.org.au/document-search/senate-legal-and-constitutional-affairs-legislation-committee-inquiry-into-the-evidence-amendment-journalists-privilege-bill-2010-and-the-evidence-amendment-journalists-privilege-bill-2010-no-2/|author=Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which recommended the Wilkie amendments, based largely on New Zealand “shield laws”, were preferable.

Prominent politicians who supported the Wilkie Bill included former Attorney-General [[Robert McClelland (Australian politician)|Robert McClelland]] and South Australian independent Senator [[Nick Xenophon]].

During the Parliamentary debate [[Australian Greens]] argued the definition of a journalist in the legislation was too narrow and should include “[[bloggers]]”, but its proposed amendments were defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dixon|first=Nicolee|title=Shield Laws for Journalists|url=http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/documents/explore/ResearchPublications/ResearchBriefs/2012/RBR201203.pdf|work=Research Brief 2012/No.03|publisher=Queensland Parliamentary Library and Research Service|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Senate passed Andrew Wilkie’s amendments to the Commonwealth Evidence Act on March 3, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|num_act|eapa2011401|Evidence Amendment (Journalists' Privilege) Act 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Australian states, including New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory have also introduced their own “shield laws” but have also elected not to extend protection for bloggers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Merritt|first=Chris|title=Another state decides against shield laws to protect bloggers: the new media faces a fresh legal rebuff|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/legal-affairs/another-state-decides-against-shield-laws-to-protect-bloggers-the-new-media-faces-a-fresh-legal-rebuff/story-e6frg97x-1226046549889|newspaper=The Australian|date=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3812">'''Resource selection functions''' (RSFs) are a class of functions that are used in [[spatial ecology]] to assess which habitat characteristics are important to a specific population or species of animal, by assessing the a probability of that animal using a certain resource proportional to the availability of that resource in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyce|first=Mark S|last2=Vernier|first2=Pierre R|last3=Nielsen|first3=Scott E|last4=Schmiegelow|first4=Fiona K. A|date=2002-11-30|title=Evaluating resource selection functions|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380002002004|journal=Ecological Modelling|volume=157|issue=2–3|pages=281–300|doi=10.1016/S0304-3800(02)00200-4|citeseerx=10.1.1.471.8823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modeling ==
Resource Selection Functions require two types of data: location information for the wildlife in question, and data on the resources available across the study area. Resources can include a broad range of environmental and geographical variables, including categorical variables such as land cover type, or continuous variables such as average rainfall over a given time period. A variety of methods are used for modeling RSFs, with [[logistic regression]] being commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Resource Selection by Animals: Statistical Design and Analysis for Field Studies|last=Manly|first=B. F.|last2=McDonald|first2=L.|last3=Thomas|first3=Dana|last4=McDonald|first4=Trent L.|last5=Erickson|first5=Wallace P.|date=2007-05-08|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9780306481512|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RSFs can be fit to data where animal presence is known, but absence is not, such as for species where several individuals within a study area are fitted with a GPS collar, but some individuals may be present without collars.
When this is the case, buffers of various distances are generated around known presence points, with a number of available points generated within each buffer, which represent areas where the animal could have been, but it is unknown whether they actually were.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Chris J.|last2=Nielsen|first2=Scott E.|last3=Merrill|first3=Evelyn H.|last4=Mcdonald|first4=Trent L.|last5=Boyce|first5=Mark S.|date=2006-04-01|title=Resource Selection Functions Based on Use–Availability Data: Theoretical Motivation and Evaluation Methods|journal=Journal of Wildlife Management|volume=70|issue=2|pages=347–357|doi=10.2193/0022-541X(2006)70[347:RSFBOU]2.0.CO;2|issn=0022-541X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These models can be fit using binomial generalized linear models or binomial generalized linear mixed models, with the resources, or environmental and geographic data, as explanatory variables.

== Scale ==
Resource selection functions can be modeled at a variety of spatial scales, depending on the species and the scientific question being studied. (insert one more sentence on scale)

Most RSFs address one of the following scales, which were defined by Douglas Johnson in 1980 and are still used today:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Douglas H.|date=1980-02-01|title=The Comparison of Usage and Availability Measurements for Evaluating Resource Preference|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=61|issue=1|pages=65–71|doi=10.2307/1937156|issn=1939-9170|jstor=1937156}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''First order selection:''' The entire range of a species
* '''Second order selection:''' The home range of an individual or group of animals
* '''Third order selection:''' Resource or habitat usage within an individual's or group's home range 
* '''Fourth order selection:''' The procurement of specific resources, such as food, at specific sites

The '''right to adequate clothing''', or the '''right to clothing''', is recognized as a [[human right]] in various [[international human rights instruments]]; this, together with the [[right to food]] and the [[right to housing]], are parts of the [[right to an adequate standard of living]] as recognized under [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights#Right to an adequate standard of living|Article 11]] of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR). The right to clothing is similarly recognized under [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights#Article 25|Article 25]] of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR).{{sfn |James |2008 |p=1}}

==Beneficiaries==
The right to clothing forms an aspect of the right to an adequate standard of living, and as such, is regarded as something that needs to be ensured so as to prevent people from living below the poverty line.{{sfn |IHRC |2014}} Indeed, being ill-clothed is emblematic of acute poverty:

{{Quote |We see it in the shivering or sweltering discomfort of 'beggars,' the homeless, the drug dependent and the 'derelict,' the elderly, the invalided, the 'street kid' or the just plain poor. Their plight has provoked condemnation, blame, disgust and derision, but religious, moral and secular creeds have in contrast exhorted us to respond with love, charity, mercy, with empathy and in a spirit of justice.{{sfn |James |2008 |pp=1-2}}|Dr Stephen James |A Forgotten Right? The Right to Clothing in International Law}}

To illustrate how far-reaching the right to clothing potentially is, Dr Stephen James has provided a non-exhaustive list of beneficiaries of the right to minimum clothing. Included on this list are those sections of society that suffer the greatest from a lack of clothing, such as:{{sfn |James |2008 |p=3}}

[[File:Homesless in Roma.jpg|thumb|The homeless are a section of society that suffer greatly from a lack of adequate clothing.]]

* The poor, including the [[unemployed]], [[underemployment|under-employed]] and [[working poor]];
* [[Pensioner]]s and others dependent on [[social security]];

== Recognition ==
The lack of discussion about the right to clothing has led to uncertainty as to the ambit of the right and how much clothing is required. Matthew Craven notes that a minimum level of clothing is what is required to be provided; it is of "paramount importance not least because at minimum levels it represents a question of survival." {{sfn |Craven |1995 |p=287}} This requirement of a "minimum" or "adequate" standard is mirrored in reports from the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child|UN Committee on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC){{sfn |CRC |2005}} and a report from the Consortium For Street Children,{{sfn |CSC |2009}} as well as a number of General Comments from the [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (CESCR) as regards the elderly,{{sfn |CESCR |1996}} disabled,{{sfn |CESCR |1995}} and workers.{{sfn |CESCR |2000}} There is, however, no indication as to what such a "minimum" or "adequate" standard entails: indeed, only rarely has the CESCR questioned a party state of the ICESCR on its performance with respect to the right to clothing.{{sfn |James |2008 |p=4}}{{sfn |Craven |1995 |pp=349, 413}}

There has been limited academic commentary on the ambit of the right to clothing with regards to refugees. James Hathaway has argued that refugees should have access to clothing that suitable for the climate and is sufficient for any work or other roles they may wish to undertake. Furthermore, they should not be compelled to wear any sort of clothing that would lead to social stigma or discrimination as foreigners.{{sfn |Hathaway |2005 |p=503}} On the other hand, however, should refugees choose to wear clothing that is representative of their culture, country of origin or society, they are protected under Article 27 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] to do so.{{sfn |Hathaway |2005 |p=504}} The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has tended towards applying context-specific interpretations on what is an adequate standard of clothing; so far, the right in its general sense has not yet been considered in a general comment.{{sfn |Hathaway |2005 |p=504, footnote 1047}}

The right to clothing has been recognised domestically for millennia &amp;nbsp;– at least partially &amp;nbsp;– but has received very little recognition on the international scene.{{sfn |James |2008 |pp=1-2}} It is not clear why there is a lack of recognition; one author has suggested that the lack of elaboration is due to the variations in cultural needs and wants.{{sfn |IHRC |2014}} However, this explanation has been regarded as "not plausible": Dr James notes that "[c]ultural, environmental and economic variations in 'needs and wants' are surely as marked with regard to housing, health as they are in relation to clothing, but this has not prevented detailed elaboration of those rights in international law."{{sfn |James |2008 |p=4}} Matthew Craven concluded in 1995 that:

{{quote|The right to clothing, although specifically included in the Covenant, has had little attention either from the Committee [CESCR] or independent commentators. As far as the Committee is concerned, no reference to clothing is to be found in reporting guidelines, and only the occasional question has been asked of States by individual members. The impression given is that clothing is not a matter in which the State may exercise a great deal of control, nor one that the Committee feels is of great importance.{{sfn |Craven |1995 |pp=349, 413}}|Matthew Craven |The international covenant on economic, social, and cultural rights : a perspective on its development}}

However, Dr James has remarked: "...none of us can be complacent that we will not find ourselves [...] in need of adequate clothing. The right is of great practical importance. It is an essential subsistence right, not an embellishment or a legal absurdity".{{sfn |James |2008 |p=4}} He also called for further discussion and academic commentary, arguing:

{{quote|We must remember the right to adequate clothing when examining the right to an adequate standard of living in international law. The health, dignity and very lives of a range of vulnerable people [...] can be at risk when they are not adequately clothed. [...] [I]t will be useful to explore the possibilities that lie in reasoning by analogy from CESCR jurisprudence on other rights within Article 11 of the ICESCR. After all, the CESCR has begun to develop criteria, in some cases quite detailed, regarding required standards in relation to 'adequate' housing, health, food, water and so on. There is no reason why a similar approach might not be undertaken in relation to the right to adequate clothing.{{sfn |James |2008 |pp=23-24}}|Dr Stephen James |A Forgotten Right? The Right to Clothing in International Law}}

==Interaction between the right to clothing and other human rights==

As the right to clothing concerns such a fundamental aspect of humanity, it naturally interacts with other human rights that are contained within various human rights instruments.{{sfn |James |2008 |pp=13-17}}

===Right to life===
{{main|Right to Life}}

Everyone has the essential right to life, as confirmed under [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights#Article 3|Article 3]] of the UDHR. However, if people are not adequately clothed, they are far more exposed to the elements. Without warm clothing, a person may well die from [[hypothermia]] during a cold winter; clothing that is inappropriately warm, on the other hand, could contribute to [[heat stroke]], [[dehydration]] and [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]] during summer or in tropical climates. Furthermore, inadequate clothing could increase exposure to [[ultraviolet rays]]; aggravate [[Allergy|allergies]] and skin conditions; and worsen pre-existing medical conditions.{{sfn |James |2008 |p=12}}

Additionally, access to medical care&amp;nbsp;– similarly confirmed under [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights#Article 25|Article 25]] of the UDHR as well as [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights#Right to health|Article 12]] of the ICESCR &amp;nbsp;– can be impeded by inadequate access to clothing, particularly if the access to therapeutic clothing or orthopedic footwear is unavailable or prohibitively expensive.{{sfn |James |2008 |p=12}}

===Right to freedom of expression===
{{main|Freedom of speech}}

Wearing clothes&amp;nbsp;– or more accurately, choosing which clothes to wear&amp;nbsp;– is, for many people, an important part of expression as confirmed under [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights#Article 19|Article 19]] of the UDHR. Persons with serious disabilities may be dress inappropriately, denying their desired expression. Furthermore, being forced to wear dirty, ripped, ill-fitting and even extremely outdated clothing may invite ridicule and contempt and inflict shame.{{sfn |James |2008 |p=13}} This can be particularly true with school children &amp;nbsp;– parents may be reluctant to consider sending a child to school as a result of ridicule and shame brought through the clothing the child wears.{{sfn |Kornbluh |2007 |pp=39–41}} A distinction should be drawn, however, between those who are forced to wear ripped, ill-fitting or extremely outdated clothing and those who consciously choose to wear such clothes as a 'fashion statement'.{{sfn |James |2008 |p=13}}

===Right to freedom from discrimination===
{{main|Freedom from discrimination}}

The clothes that people choose to wear can identify a great number of things about a person: religious affiliations, ethnicity, national or political identity, culture, or race. Arguably, the clothes that an impoverished person wears can indicate their poverty. This sign of poverty or poorer economic status can be a cause of discrimination and of vilification. Additionally, clothing which is culturally distinctive or [[Religious clothing|denotes religious affiliation]] could provoke discrimination and lead to a denial of social, economic, or political opportunities.{{sfn |James |2008 |p=14}}

===Right to freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment===
{{main|Torture|Cruel and unusual punishment}}

There is a large potential for "abuses of trust, for humiliations and various physical abuses in medical and institutional settings, especially in relation to women and children, the disabled and elderly."{{sfn |James |2008 |p=14}} If a person is denied access to adequate clothing &amp;nbsp;– especially essential clothes, such as undergarments &amp;nbsp;– it is possible that they may be rendered vulnerable to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment under the ambit of [[Universal declaration of human rights#Article 5|Article 5]] of the UDHR. Such denial would include forcibly taking clothes, and is of particular importance in the context of detention and prisons: "[o]ne can literally be left naked in the midst of power, a tragic condition [...] seen too often in prisons, in war and in concentration camps."{{sfn |James |2008 |p=14}} Examples of such abuses in [[Abu Ghraib]] prison in Iraq and [[Guantanamo Bay]] have found to have caused serious mental illnesses, including [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], resulting from forcing prisoners to strip naked and parade in front of female guards, as well as male detainees being forced to wear female underwear.{{sfn |Hess |2008}}

The '''sit-ups punishment''' (Uthak Baithak) is a form of punishment given in schools of Indian subcontinent, specially in [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Pakistan]]. In this punishment, one has to sit down and stand up continuously and count the number of sit-ups. It is a common punishment in schools. Generally students are asked to perform this with holding their ears with hands. For humiliation, it is done in front of other students. Normally given in the range of 10 to 100 sit up for boys and 10-50 sit up for girls.
==Variants==
There are many forms of this punishment.
===Simple Situps===
The student will do situps holding his ears. The hands should be ninety degrees with the body. Also he/she has to count loudly with every step. If the count is not hearable the term will repeat. Every term he/she has to sit fully so that his back touch the heals and to stand straight.
===Criss-Cross Earholding===
The punished will hold his/her left year with right hand and right ear with left hand. This may cause hardness and humilation to the punishment. It is famous mostly.
===Pairing Situps===
There will be more than one student and they will hold ears of one another and do the situps. This makes the punishment more hard as the punished have to take weight of anothers. Also criss-cross  earholding can be applied here. Then it will be extra hard to complete.
===Situps touching heals===
It is also varient used with the simple situps. Here the punished's heals should touch one another. This will cause friction between the knees for that he/she can fall. Criss-cross earholding can be applied here..
===Other Varients===
Doing situps in the sun, situps with leaving tough are other types of punishment.

== Definition of size asymmetry ==

Resource competition can vary from complete symmetric (all individuals receive the same amount of resources, irrespective of their size, known also as [[scramble competition]]) to perfectly size symmetric (all individuals exploit the same amount of resource per unit biomass) to absolutely size asymmetric (the largest individuals exploit all the available resource). The degree of size asymmetry can be described by the parameter θ in the following equation focusing on the partition of the resource r among n individuals of sizes Bj.&lt;ref name="Schwinning Weiner 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwinning Fox 1995"&gt;Schwinning, S. &amp; Fox, G. A. Population-dynamic consequences of competitive symmetry in annual plants. Oikos 72, 422-432, [[doi:10.2307/3546128]] (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{#tag:math|r_i=r(B_i)^\theta}}
{{#tag:math|/\sum_{j=1}^{n}(B_j)^\theta}}

ri refers to the amount of resource consumed by individual i in the neighbourhood of j. When θ =1, competition is perfectly size symmetric, e.g. if a large individual is twice the size of its smaller competitor, the large individual will acquire twice the amount of that resource (i.e. both individuals will exploit the same amount of resource per biomass unit). When θ &gt;1 competition is size-asymmetric, e.g.  if large individual is twice the size of its smaller competitor and θ =2, the large individual will acquire four times the amount of that resource (i.e. the large individual will exploit twice the amount of resource per biomass unit). As θ increases, competition becomes more size-asymmetric and larger plants get larger amounts of resource per unit biomass compared with smaller plants.

== Differences in size-asymmetry among resources in plant communities ==

Competition among plants for [[light]] is size-asymmetric because of the directionality of its supply.&lt;ref name="Weiner 1990"/&gt; Higher [[leaves]] shade lower leaves but not vice versa.  Competition for [[nutrients]] appears to be relatively size-symmetric,&lt;ref&gt;Berntson, G. M. &amp; Wayne, P. M. Characterizing the size dependence of resource acquisition within crowded plant populations. Ecology 81, 1072-1085, [[doi:10.1890/0012-9658]](2000)081[1072:ctsdor]2.0.co;2 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; although it has been hypothesized that a patchy distribution of nutrients in the soil may lead to size-asymmetry in competition among roots.&lt;ref name="Schwinning Weiner 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rajaniemi, T. K. Evidence for size asymmetry of belowground competition. Basic and Applied Ecology 4, 239-247, doi:10.1078/1439-1791-00151 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  Nothing is known about the size-asymmetry of competition for [[water]].&lt;ref name="Schwinning Weiner 1998"/&gt;

== Implication for plant communities ==
Various ecological processes and patterns have been shown to be affected by the degree of size-asymmetry e.g. [[Ecological succession|succession]],&lt;ref&gt;Rees, M. &amp; Bergelson, J. Asymmetric light competition and founder control in plant communities.

A. &amp; Hector, A. Competition for Light Causes Plant Biodiversity Loss After Eutrophication. Science 324, 636-638, [[doi:10.1126/science.1169640]] (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borer, E. T. et al. Herbivores and nutrients control grassland plant diversity via light limitation. Nature 508, 517-520, [[doi:10.1038/nature13144]] (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is still a debate whether this phenomenon is related to the size-asymmetry of light competition&lt;ref name="Lamb et al 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeMalach et al 2016"/&gt; or to other factors.&lt;ref&gt;Harpole, W. S. &amp; Tilman, D. Grassland species loss resulting from reduced niche dimension. Nature 446, 791-793, [[doi:10.1038/nature05684]] (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrasting assumptions about size-asymmetry characterise the two leading and competing theories in plant ecology,&lt;ref name="DeMalach et al 2016" /&gt; the [[R* rule|R* theory]] and the [[Universal adaptive strategy theory|CSR theory]]. The R* theory assumes that competition is size-symmetric and therefore predicts that competitive ability in nature results from the ability to withstand low level of resources (known as the [[R* rule]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tilman, D. Resource competition and community structure. Monographs in population biology 17, 1-296 (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast the CSR theory assumes that competition is size-asymmetric and therefore predicts that competitive ability in nature results from the ability to grow fast and attain a large size.&lt;ref&gt;Grime, J. P. Evidence for existence of three primary strategies in plants and its relevance to ecological and evolutionary theory. American Naturalist 111, 1169-1194 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

Size-asymmetric competition affects also several [[evolutionary]] processes in relation to trait selection. Evolution of plant height is highly affected by asymmetric light competition.&lt;ref name="Tilman 1988"&gt;Tilman, D. Plant strategies and the dynamics and structure of plant communities. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, USA. 360. p. (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Falster Westoby 2003"&gt;Falster, D. S. &amp; Westoby, M. Plant height and evolutionary games. Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 18, 337-343, [[doi:10.1016/s0169-5347(03)00061-2]] (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Theory predicts that only under asymmetric light competition, plants will grow upward and invest in [[wood]] production at  the expense of investment in leaves, or in [[reproductive]] organs ([[flowers]] and [[fruits]]).&lt;ref name="Tilman 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Falster Westoby 2003"/&gt;  Consistent with this, there is evidence that plant height increases as water availability increases,&lt;ref&gt;Klein, T., Randin, C. &amp; Korner, C. Water availability predicts forest canopy height at the global scale. Ecology Letters 18, 1311-1320, [[doi:10.1111/ele.12525]] (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; presumably due to increase in the relative importance of size-asymmetric competition for light. Similarly, investment in the size of seeds at the expense of their number may be more effective undersize-asymmetric resource competition, since larger seeds tend to produce larger seedlings that are better competitors.&lt;ref name="Falster et al 2008"&gt;Falster, D. S., Moles, A. T. &amp; Westoby, M. A general model for the scaling of offspring size and adult size. American Naturalist 172, 299-317, [[doi:10.1086/589889]] (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
Size-asymmetric competition can be exploited in managing plant communities, such as the suppression of [[weed]] in [[crop]] fields.&lt;ref name="Falster et al 2008"/&gt;  Weeds are a greater problem for farmer in dry than in moist environments, in large part because crops can suppress weeds much more effectively undersize-asymmetric competition for light than under more size-symmetric competition below ground.

'''Sophia''' ({{lang-grc-koi|Σοφíα}} "Wisdom", {{lang-cop|ⲧⲥⲟⲫⲓⲁ}} "the Sophia"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nag Hammadi Codex II, 2-7|editor-first=Bentley|editor-last=Layton|publisher=E.J. Brill|location=Leiden|year=1989|ISBN=90-04-09019-3|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=DpV2JWlHxBoC&amp;lpg=PR10&amp;pg=PA158#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 158–9], [https://books.google.com/books?id=DpV2JWlHxBoC&amp;lpg=PR10&amp;pg=PA252#v=onepage 252–3]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a major theme, along with Knowledge ({{lang|grc|γνῶσις}} ''[[gnosis]]'', Coptic ''sooun''), among many of the early Christian knowledge-theologies grouped by the heresiologist [[Irenaeus]] as ''gnostikos'', "learned". [[Gnosticism]] is a 17th-century term expanding the definition of Irenaeus' groups to include other syncretic and mystery religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/236343/Gnosticism |title= Gnosticism|author= Michael Williams|date= |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=17 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In gnosticism, Sophia is a feminine figure, analogous to the human soul but also simultaneously one of the feminine aspects of [[God]]. Gnostics held that she was the ''syzygy'' (female twin [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|divine Aeon]]) of [[Jesus]] (i.e. the [[Bride of Christ]]), and [[Holy Spirit]] of the [[Trinity]]. She is occasionally referred to by the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] equivalent of ''Achamōth'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀχαμώθ}}, {{lang-he|חכמה}} ''[[chokhmah]]'') and as ''Prunikos'' ({{lang|grc|Προύνικος}}).  In the [[Nag Hammadi]] texts, Sophia is the lowest Aeon, or anthropic expression of the emanation of the light of God. She is considered to have fallen from grace in some way, in so doing creating or helping to create the material world.

==Gnostic mythos==
{{Original research|"Gnostic mythos" section|date=October 2011}}

Almost all Gnostic systems of the [[Gnosticism#Major Gnostic schools and their texts|Syrian or Egyptian]] type taught that the universe began with an original, unknowable [[God]], referred to as the Parent or [[Bythos]], or as the [[Monad (Gnosticism)|Monad]] by [[Monoimus]]. From this initial unitary beginning, the One spontaneously [[emanationism|emanated]] further [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|Aeon]]s, being pairs of progressively 'lesser' beings in sequence. Together with the source from which they emanate they form the ''[[Pleroma]]'', or fullness, of God, and thus should not be seen as distinct from the divine, but symbolic abstractions of the divine nature. The transition from the immaterial to the material, from the noumenal to the sensible, is brought about by a flaw, or a passion, or a sin, in one of the Aeons.

In most versions of the Gnostic mythos, it is Sophia who brings about this instability in the Pleroma, in turn bringing about the creation of materiality. According to some Gnostic texts, the crisis occurs as a result of Sophia trying to emanate without her syzygy or, in another tradition, because she tries to breach the barrier between herself and the unknowable [[Bythos]]. After cataclysmically falling from the Pleroma, Sophia's fear and anguish of losing her life (just as she lost the light of the One) causes confusion and longing to return to it. Because of these longings, [[matter]] (Greek: ''[[hyle|hylē]]'', ὕλη) and  [[soul]] (Greek: ''psychē'', ψυχή) accidentally come into existence. The creation of the [[Demiurge]] (also known as Yaldabaoth, "Son of Chaos") is also a mistake made during this exile. The Demiurge proceeds to create the physical world in which we live, ignorant of Sophia, who nevertheless manages to infuse some spiritual spark or ''[[pneuma]]'' into his creation.

In the ''[[Pistis Sophia]]'', Christ is sent from the Godhead in order to bring Sophia back into the fullness (Pleroma). Christ enables her to again see the light, bringing her knowledge of the [[spirit]] (Greek: ''pneuma'', πνευμα). Christ is then sent to earth in the form of the man [[Jesus]] to give men the [[Gnosis]] needed to rescue themselves from the physical world and return to the [[Spirit|spiritual world]]. In Gnosticism, the Gospel story of Jesus is itself allegorical: it is the Outer [[Mysteries of Eleusis|Mystery]], used as an introduction to Gnosis, rather than it being literally true in a historical context. For the Gnostics, the drama of the redemption of the Sophia through Christ or the [[Logos]] is the central drama of the universe. The Sophia resides in all of us as the [[Divine Spark]].

==Book of Proverbs==
Jewish Alexandrine religious philosophy was much occupied with the concept of the Divine ''Sophia'', as the revelation of God's inward thought, and assigned to her not only the formation and ordering of the natural universe (comp. [[Clementine literature|Clem. ''Hom.'']] [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume VIII/Pseudo-Clementine Literature/The Clementine Homilies/Homily XVI/Chapter 12|xvi. 12]]) but also the communication of all insight and knowledge to mankind. In {{bibleverse||Proverbs|8}} Wisdom (the noun is feminine) is described as God's Counsellor and Workmistress (Master-workman, R.V.), who dwelt beside Him before the Creation of the world and sported continually before Him.

In accordance with the description given in the Book of Proverbs, a dwelling-place was assigned by the Gnostics to the Sophia, and her relation to the upper world defined as well as to the seven planetary powers which were placed under her. The seven planetary spheres or heavens were for the ancients the highest regions of the created universe. They were thought of as seven circles rising one above another, and dominated by the seven [[archon (Gnosticism)|Archons]]. These constituted the (Gnostic) Hebdomad. Above the highest of them, and over-vaulting it, was the [[Ogdoad (Gnosticism)|Ogdoad]], the sphere of immutability, which was nigh to the spiritual world ([[Clemens Alexandrinus]], ''[[Stromata]]'', [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume II/CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA/The Stromata, or Miscellanies/Book IV./Chapter XXIII.|iv. 25]], 161; comp. [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume II/CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA/The Stromata, or Miscellanies/Book VI/Chapter XVI.|vi. 16]], 138 sqq.). Now we read in {{bibleverse||Proverbs|9:1}}:
{{Quote|Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:}}
These seven pillars being interpreted as the planetary heavens, the habitation of the Sophia herself was placed above the Hebdomad in the Ogdoad (''Excerpt. ex Theodot''. 8, 47). It is said further of the same divine wisdom ({{bibleverse||Proverbs|8:2}}):
{{Quote|She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.}}
This meant, according to the Gnostic interpretation, that the Sophia has her dwelling-place "on the heights" above the created universe, in the place of the midst, between the upper and lower world, between the Pleroma and the ''ektismena''. She sits at "the gates of the mighty," i.e. at the approaches to the realms of the seven Archons, and at the "entrances" to the upper realm of light her praise is sung. The Sophia is therefore the highest ruler over the visible universe, and at the same time the mediatrix between the upper and the lower realms. She shapes this mundane universe after the heavenly prototypes, and forms the seven star-circles with their Archons under whose dominion are placed, according to the astrological conceptions of antiquity, the fates of all earthly things, and more especially of man. She is "the mother" or "the mother of the living." ([[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiph]]. ''[[Panarion|Haer]]''. 26, 10). As coming from above, she is herself of pneumatic essence, the ''mētēr phōteinē'' (Epiph. 40, 2) or the ''anō dynamis'' (Epiph. 39, 2) from which all pneumatic souls draw their origin.

==Descent==
In reconciling the doctrine of the pneumatic nature of the Sophia with the dwelling-place assigned her, according to the Proverbs, in the kingdom of the midst, and so outside the upper realm of light, there was envisioned a descent of Sophia from her heavenly home, the Pleroma, into the void (''[[kenōma]]'') beneath it. The concept was that of a seizure or robbery of light, or of an outburst and diffusion of light-dew into the ''kenōma'', occasioned by a vivifying movement in the upper world. But inasmuch as the light brought down into the darkness of this lower world was thought of and described as involved in suffering, this suffering must be regarded as a punishment. This inference was further aided by the [[Platonism|Platonic]] notion of a spiritual fall.

==Mythos of the soul==
Alienated through their own fault from their heavenly home, souls have sunk down into this lower world without utterly losing the remembrance of their former state, and filled with longing for their lost inheritance, these fallen souls are still striving upwards. In this way the [[mythos]] of the fall of Sophia can be regarded as having a typical significance. The fate of the "mother" was regarded as the prototype of what is repeated in the history of all individual souls, which, being of a heavenly pneumatic origin, have fallen from the upper world of light their home, and come under the sway of evil powers, from whom they must endure a long series of sufferings until a return into the upper world be once more vouchsafed them.

But whereas, according to the Platonic philosophy, fallen souls still retain a remembrance of their lost home, this notion was preserved in another form in Gnostic circles. It was taught that the souls of the Pneumatici, having lost the remembrance of their heavenly derivation, required to become once more partakers of Gnosis, or knowledge of their own pneumatic essence, in order to make a return to the realm of light. In the impartation of this Gnosis consists the redemption brought and vouchsafed by Christ to pneumatic souls. But the various fortunes of such souls were wont to be contemplated in those of Sophia, and so it was taught that the Sophia also needed the redemption wrought by Christ, by whom she is delivered from her ''agnoia'' and her ''pathe'', and will, at the end of the world's development, be again brought back to her long lost home, the Upper Pleroma, into which this mother will find an entrance along with all pneumatic souls her children, and there, in the heavenly bridal chamber, celebrate the marriage feast of eternity.

==Syrian Gnosis==
The [[Sophia mythos]] has in the various Gnostic systems undergone great variety of treatment. The oldest, the Syrian Gnosis, referred to the ''Sophia'' the formation of the lower world and the production of its rulers the Archons; and along with this they also ascribed to her the preservation and propagation of the spiritual seed.

===Formation of the lower world ===
[[Image:SophiaMystical.jpg|thumb|left|240px|A mystical depiction of Sophia from ''Geheime Figuren der [[Rosicrucianism|Rosenkreuzer]]'', [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], 1785.]]
As described by [[Irenaeus]], the great Mother-principle of the universe appears as the first woman, the Holy Spirit (''rūha d'qudshā'') moving over the waters, and is also called the mother of all living. Under her are the four material elements—water, darkness, abyss, and chaos. With her, combine themselves the two supreme masculine lights, the first and the second man, the Father and the Son, the latter being also designated as the Father's ''ennoia''. From their union proceeds the third imperishable light, the third man, Christ. But unable to support the abounding fulness of this light, the mother in giving birth to Christ, suffers a portion of this light to overflow on the left side. While, then, Christ as ''dexios'' (He of the right hand) mounts upward with his mother into the imperishable Aeon, that other light which has overflowed on the left hand, sinks down into the lower world, and there produces matter. And this is the Sophia, called also ''Aristera'' (she of the left hand), ''Prouneikos'' and the male-female.

There is here, as yet, no thought of a fall, properly so called, as in the Valentinian system. The power which has thus overflowed leftwards, makes a voluntary descent into the lower waters, confiding in its possession of the spark of true light. It is, moreover, evident that though mythologically distinguished from the ''humectatio luminis'' (Greek: ''ikmas phōtos'', ἰκμὰς φωτός), the Sophia is yet, really nothing else but the light-spark coming from above, entering this lower material world, and becoming here the source of all formation, and of both the higher and the lower life. She swims over the waters, and sets their hitherto immoveable mass in motion, driving them into the abyss, and taking to herself a bodily form from the ''hylē''. She compasses about, and is laden with material every kind of weight and substance, so that, but for the essential spark of light, she would be sunk and lost in the material. Bound to the body which she has assumed and weighed down thereby, she seeks in vain to make her escape from the lower waters, and hasten upwards to rejoin her heavenly mother. Not succeeding in this endeavour, she seeks to preserve, at least, her light-spark from being injured by the lower elements, raises herself by its power to the realm of the upper region, and there spreading herself out she forms out of her own bodily part, the dividing wall of the visible firmament, but still retains the ''aquatilis corporis typus''. Finally seized with a longing for the higher light, she finds, at length, in herself, the power to raise herself even above the heaven of her own forming, and to fully lay aside her corporeity. The body thus abandoned is called "Woman from Woman."

===Creation and redemption===
The narrative proceeds to tell of the formation of the seven Archons by Sophia herself, of the creation of man, which "the mother" (i.e. not the first woman, but the Sophia) uses as a mean to deprive the Archons of their share of light, of the perpetual conflict on his mother's part with the self-exalting efforts of the Archons, and of her continuous striving to recover again and again the light-spark hidden in human nature, till, at length, Christ comes to her assistance and in answer to her prayers, proceeds to draw all the sparks of light to Himself, unites Himself with the Sophia as the bridegroom with the bride, descends on Jesus who has been prepared, as a pure vessel for His reception, by Sophia, and leaves him again before the crucifixion, ascending with Sophia into the world or Aeon which will never pass away ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXX.|Irenaeus, i. 30]]; Epiph. 37, 3, sqq.; Theodoret, h. f. i. 14).

===As world-soul===
In this system the original cosmogonic significance of the Sophia still stands in the foreground. The antithesis of Christus and Sophia, as He of the right (''ho dexios'') and She of the Left (''hē aristera''), as male and female, is but a repetition of the first Cosmogonic Antithesis in another form. The Sophia herself is but a reflex of the "Mother of all living" and is therefore also called "Mother." She is the formatrix of heaven and earth, for as much as mere matter can only receive form through the light which, coming down from above has interpenetrated the dark waters of the ''hylē;'' but she is also at the same time the spiritual principle of life in creation, or, as the world-soul the representative of all that is truly pneumatic in this lower world: her fates and experiences represent typically those of the pneumatic soul which has sunk down into chaos.

==''Prunikos''==
{{Quote box|align=right|For I am the first and the last.&lt;br&gt;I am the honored one and the scorned one.&lt;br&gt;I am the whore and the holy one.|—''[[The Thunder, Perfect Mind]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nag Hammadi Library in English|first=George|last=MacRae|editor1-first=James M.|editor1-last=Robinson|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1990|location=San Francisco|chapter=The Thunder: Perfect Mind|url=http://gnosis.org/naghamm/thunder.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In the Gnostic system described by Irenaeus ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXI.|I. xxi.]]; see [[Ophites]]) the name Prunikos several times takes the place of Sophia in the relation of her story. The name Prunikos is also given to Sophia in the account of the kindred Barbeliot system, given in the preceding chapter of Irenaeus. [[Celsus]], who shows that he had met with some Ophite work, exhibits acquaintance with the name Prunikos ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Origen/Origen Against Celsus/Book VI/Chapter XXXIV|Orig. ''Adv. Cels''. vi. 34]]) a name which Origen recognizes as Valentinian. That this Ophite name had really been adopted by the Valentinians is evidenced by its occurrence in a Valentinian fragment preserved by Epiphanius (Epiph. ''Haer''. xxxi. 5). Epiphanius also introduces Prunikos as a technical word in the system of the [[Simonians]] (Epiph. ''Haer''. xxi. 2) of those whom he describes under the head of [[Nicolaitans]] (Epiph. ''Haer''. xxv. 3, 4) and of the Ophites (Epiph. ''Haer''. xxxvii. 4, 6).

===Etymology===
Neither Irenaeus nor Origen indicates that he knew anything as to the meaning of this word; and we have no better information on this subject than a conjecture of Epiphanius (Epiph. ''Haer''. xxv. 48). He says that the word means "wanton" or "lascivious," for that the Greeks had a phrase concerning a man who had debauched a girl, ''Eprounikeuse tautēn''. One feels some hesitation in accepting this explanation. Epiphanius was deeply persuaded of the filthiness of Gnostic morals, and habitually put the worst interpretation on their language. If the phrase reported by Epiphanius had been common, it is strange that instances of its use should not have been quoted from the Greek comic writers. It need not be denied that Epiphanius had heard the phrase employed, but innocent words come to be used in an obscene sense, as well by those who think ''[[double entendre]]'' witty, as by those who modestly avoid the use of plainer language. The primary meaning of the word ''prouneikos'' seems to be a porter, or bearer of burdens, the derivation being from ''enenkein'', the only derivation indeed that the word seems to admit of. Then, modifying its meaning like the word ''agoraios'', it came to be used in the sense of a turbulent violent person. The only distinct confirmation of the explanation of Epiphanius is that [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] (''s. v. Skitaloi'') has the words ''aphrodisiōn kai tēs prounikias tēs nykterinēs''. This would be decisive, if we could be sure that these words were earlier in date than Epiphanius.

In favour of the explanation of Epiphanius is the fact, that in the Gnostic cosmogonical myths, the imagery of sexual passion is constantly introduced. It seems on the whole probable that ''prouneikos'' is to be understood in the sense of ''propherēs'' which has for one of its meanings&lt;ref&gt;See the references in [[Liddell and Scott]].&lt;/ref&gt; "precocious in respect of sexual intercourse." According to [[Ernst Wilhelm Möller]] (1860) the name is possibly meant to indicate her attempts to entice away again from the lower Cosmic Powers the seed of Divine light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ernst Wilhelm|last=Möller|title=Geschichte der Kosmologie in der griechischen Kirche bis auf Origenes. Mit Specialuntersuchungen über die gnostischen Systeme|location=Halle|year=1860|page=270 sqq}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the account given by Epiphanius (''Haer''. 37:6) the allusion to enticements to sexual intercourse which is involved in this name, becomes more prominent.

However, in the ''[[Exegesis on the Soul]]'' text found at Nag Hammadi, the soul is likened to a woman which fell from perfection into prostitution, and that the Father will elevate her again to her original perfect state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nag Hammadi Library in English|first=William C. |last=Robinson Jr.|editor1-first=James M.|editor1-last=Robinson|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1990|location=San Francisco|chapter=Exegesis on the Soul|url=http://gnosis.org/naghamm/exe.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the female personification of the soul resembles the passion of Sophia as Prunikos.

==The womb, ''mētra''==
Nigh related to this is the notion widely diffused among Gnostic sects of the impure ''mētra'' ([[womb]]) from whence the whole world is supposed to have issued. As according to the Italian Valentinians the Soter opens the ''mētra'' of the lower Sophia, (the ''Enthymēsis''), and so occasions the formation of the universe ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter III.|Iren. I. 3]], [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter III.|4]]) so on the other hand the ''mētra'' itself is personified. So Epiphanius reports the following cosmogony as that of a branch of the Nicolaitans:
{{Quote|In the beginning were Darkness, Chaos, and Water (''skotos, kai bythos, kai hydōr''), but the Spirit indwelling in the midst of them, divided them one from another. From the intermingling of Darkness with Spirit proceeds the ''mētra'' which again is kindled with fresh desire after the Spirit; she gives birth first to four, and then to other four aeons, and so produces a right and a left, light and darkness. Last of all comes forth an ''aischros aiōn'', who has intercourse with the ''mētra'', the offspring whereof are Gods, Angels, Daemons, and Spirits.|Epiphanius, ''Haer''. 25, 5}}
The [[Sethians]] ([[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]]. ''[[Philosophumena|Philosophum]].'' [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Refutation of All Heresies/Book X/Part 8|v. 7]]) teach in like manner that from the first concurrence (''syndromē'') of the three primeval principles arose heaven and earth as a ''megalē tis idea sphragidos''. These have the form of a ''mētra'' with the ''[[omphalos]]'' in the midst. The pregnant ''mētra'' therefore contains within itself all kinds of animal forms in the reflex of heaven and earth and all substances found in the middle region. This ''mētra'' also encounters us in the great ''[[Simonians#The Great Declaration|Apophasis]]'' ascribed to Simon where it is also called Paradise and [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] as being the locality of man's formation.

These cosmogonic theories have their precedent in the Thalatth or [[Tiamat]] of Syrian mythology, the life-mother of whom [[Berossus]] has so much to relate, or in the world-egg out of which when cloven asunder heaven and earth and all things proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Richard Adelbert Lipsius|first=Richard Adelbert|last=Lipsius|title=Gnosticismus|page=119 sqq|year=1860|publisher=Brockhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of this Berossian Thalatth meets us again among the [[Peratae]] of the ''[[Philosophumena]]'' ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Refutation of All Heresies/Book V/Part 10|Hippolytus, ''Philosophum.'' v. 9]]) and is sometimes mistakenly identified with that of the sea—''[[Thalassa (mythology)|thalassa]]''.

==Baruch-Gnosis==
A similar part to that of the ''mētra'' is played by Edem, consort of [[Elohim]] in the Gnostic book ''Baruch'' ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Refutation of All Heresies/Book V/Part 19|Hippolytus, ''Philosoph''. v. 18 sqq.]]) who there appears as a two-shaped being formed above as a woman and from the middle downwards as a serpent ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Refutation of All Heresies/Book V/Part 22|21]]).

Among the four and twenty Angels which she bears to Elohim, and which form the world out of her members, the second female angelic form is called ''Achamōs'' [''Achamōth'']. Like to this legend of the ''Philosophumena'' concerning the Baruch-Gnosis is that which is related by Epiphanius of an Ophite Party that they fabled that a Serpent from the Upper World had had sexual intercourse with the Earth as with a woman (Epiphanius, ''Haer''. 45: 1 cf. 2).

== Barbeliotae ==
Very nigh related to the doctrines of the Gnostics in Irenaeus are the views of the so-called Barbeliotae ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXIX.|Iren. I. 29]]). The name [[Barbelo]], which according to one interpretation is a designation of the upper [[Tetrad (Greek philosophy)|Tetrad]], has originally nothing to do with the Sophia. This latter Being called also ''Spiritus Sanctus'' and ''Prunikos'' is the offspring of the first angel who stands at the side of the Monogenes. Sophia seeing that all the rest have each its ''syzygos'' within the Pleroma, desires also to find such a consort for herself; and not finding one in the upper world she looks down into the lower regions and being still unsatisfied there she descends at length against the will of the Father into the deep. Here she forms the Demiurge (the ''Proarchōn''), a composite of ignorance and self-exaltation. This Being, by virtue of pneumatic powers stolen from his mother, proceeds to form the lower world. The mother, on the other hand, flees away into the upper regions and makes her dwelling there in the Ogdoad.

==The [[Ophites]]==
We meet this Sophia also among the [[Ophites|Ophiana]] whose "[[Ophite Diagrams|Diagram]]" is described by [[Celsus]] and [[Origen]], as well as among various Gnostic (Ophite) parties mentioned by Epiphanius. She is there called Sophia or Prunikos, the upper mother and upper power, and sits enthroned above the Hebdomad (the seven Planetary Heavens) in the Ogdoad (Origen, ''[[Contra Celsum|Against Celsus]]''. [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Origen/Origen Against Celsus/Book VI/Chapter XXXI|vi. 31]], [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Origen/Origen Against Celsus/Book VI/Chapter XXXIV|34]], [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Origen/Origen Against Celsus/Book VI/Chapter XXXV|35]], [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Origen/Origen Against Celsus/Book VI/Chapter XXXVIII|38]]; Epiphan. ''Haer''. 25, 3 sqq. 26, 1,10. 39, 2 ; 40, 2). She is also occasionally called ''Parthenos'' ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Origen/Origen Against Celsus/Book VI/Chapter XXXI|Orig. ''c. Cels.'' vi. 31]]) and again is elsewhere identified with the Barbelo or Barbero (Epiph. ''Haer''. 25, 3 ; 26, 1, 10).

==[[Simon Magus]]==
[[Image:Leighton Helen of Troy.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Helen of Troy|Helen]] on the Ramparts of Troy'' by [[Frederick Leighton]]; an incarnation of the ''Ennoia'' in the [[Simonians|Simonian]] system.]]

===The ''Ennoia''===
{{anchor|Ennoia}}This mythos of the soul and her descent into this lower world, with her various sufferings and changing fortunes until her final deliverance, recurs in the [[Simonians|Simonian]] system under the form of the All-Mother who issues as its first thought from the ''Hestōs'' or highest power of God. She generally bears the name ''Ennoia'', but is also called Wisdom (Sophia), Ruler, Holy Spirit, Prunikos, Barbelo. Having sunk down from the highest heavens into the lowest regions, she creates angels and archangels, and these again create and rule the material universe. Restrained and held down by the power of this lower world, she is hindered from returning to the kingdom of the Father. According to one representation she suffers all manner of insult from the angels and archangels bound and forced again and again into fresh earthly bodies, and compelled for centuries to wander in ever new corporeal forms. According to another account she is in herself incapable of suffering, but is sent into this lower world and undergoes perpetual transformation in order to excite by her beauty the angels and powers, to impel them to engage in perpetual strife, and so gradually to deprive them of their store of heavenly light. The ''Hestōs'' himself at length comes down from the highest heaven in a phantasmal body in order to deliver the suffering ''Ennoia'', and redeem the souls held in captivity by imparting gnosis to them.

===The lost sheep===
The most frequent designation of the Simonian ''Ennoia'' is "the lost" or "the wandering sheep." The Greek divinities [[Zeus]] and [[Athena]] were interpreted to signify ''Hestōs'' and his ''Ennoia'', and in like manner the Tyrian sun-god [[Herakles]]-[[Melkart]] and the moon-goddess [[Selene]]-[[Astarte]]. So also the [[Homer]]ic [[Helen of Troy|Helena]], as the cause of quarrel between Greeks and [[Troy|Trojans]], was regarded as a type of the ''Ennoia''. The story which the fathers of the church handed down of the intercourse of [[Simon Magus]] with his consort Helena ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXIII.|Iren. i. 23]]; [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume III/Apologetic/A Treatise on the Soul/Chapter XXXIV|Tertullian ''de Anima'', 34]]; Epiphanius ''Haer''. 21; [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume III/Anti-Marcion/Appendix: Against All Heresies/I|Pseudo-Tertullian ''Haer''. 1]]; Philaster, ''Haer''. 29; [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Refutation of All Heresies/Book VI/Part 15|''Philos''. vi. 14]], [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Refutation of All Heresies/Book VI/Part 16|15]]; [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume VIII/Pseudo-Clementine Literature/The Recognitions of Clement/Book II/Chapter 12|''Recogn''. Clem. ii. 12]]; [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume VIII/Pseudo-Clementine Literature/The Clementine Homilies/Homily II/Chapter 25|''Hom''. ii. 25]]), had probably its origin in this allegorical interpretation, according to [[Richard Adelbert Lipsius]] (1867).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard Adelbert|last=Lipsius|title=Zur Quellenkritik des Epiphanios|location=Wien|year=1867|page=74 sqq.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hestōs''===
In the Simonian ''[[Simonians#The Great Declaration|Apophasis]]'' the great ''dynamis'' (also called ''[[Nous]]'') and the great ''epinoia'' which gives birth to all things form a syzygy, from which proceeds the male-female Being, who is called ''Hestōs'' ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Refutation of All Heresies/Book VI/Part 14|''Philos''. vi. 13]]). Elsewhere ''nous'' and ''epinoia'' are called the upper-most of the three Simonian Syzygies, to which the ''Hestōs'' forms the Hebdomad: but on the other hand, ''nous'' and ''epinoia'' are identified with heaven and earth ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Refutation of All Heresies/Book VI/Part 10|''Philos''. vi. 9sqq.]]).

==[[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]]==
[[File:Valentinianpleroma-Matter.png|thumb|right|"Plérome de Valentin," from ''Histoire critique du Gnosticisme;'' Jacques Matter, 1826, Vol. II, Plate II.]]

The most significant development of this Sophia mythos is found in the [[Valentinianism|Valentinian]] system. The descent of the Sophia from the Pleroma is ascribed after [[Plato]]'s manner to a fall, and as the final cause of this fall a state of suffering is indicated which has penetrated into the Pleroma itself. Sophia or ''Mētēr'' is in the doctrine of Valentinus the last, i.e. the thirtieth Aeon in the Pleroma, from which having fallen out, she now in remembrance of the better world which she has thus forsaken, gives birth to the Christus "with a shadow" (''meta skias tinos''). While Christus returns to the Pleroma, Sophia forms the Demiurge and this whole lower world out of the ''skia'', a right and a left principle ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XI.|Iren. ''Haer''. i. 11, 1]]). For her redemption comes down to Sophia either Christus himself ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XV.|Iren. i. 15, 3]]) or the ''Soter'' ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XI.|Iren. i. 11, 1]], cf. ''exc. ex Theod''. 23; 41), as the common product of the Aeons, in order to bring her back to the Pleroma and unite her again with her ''syzygos''.

===Motive===
The motive for the Sophia's fall was defined according to the [[Anatolia]]n school to have lain therein, that by her desire to know what lay beyond the limits of the knowable she had brought herself into a state of ignorance and formlessness. Her suffering extends to the whole Pleroma. But whereas this is confirmed thereby in fresh strength, the Sophia is separated from it and gives birth outside it (by means of her ''ennoia'', her recollections of the higher world), to the Christus who at once ascends into the Pleroma, and after this she produces an ''ousia amorphos'', the image of her suffering, out of which the Demiurge and the lower world come into existence; last of all looking upwards in her helpless condition, and imploring light, she finally gives birth to the ''spermata tēs ekklēsias'', the pneumatic souls. In the work of redemption the Soter comes down accompanied by the masculine angels who are to be the future ''syzygoi'' of the (feminine) souls of the Pneumatici, and introduces the Sophia along with these Pneumatici into the heavenly bridal chamber (''Exc. ex Theod.'' 29-42; [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter II.|Iren. i. 2, 3]]). The same view, essentially meets us in the accounts of [[Marcus (Marcosian)|Marcus]], ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XVIII.|Iren. i. 18, 4]]; cf. [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XV.|15, 3]]; [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XVI.|16, 1, 2]]; [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XV.|17, 1]]) and in the Epitomators of the Syntagma of Hippolytus ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume III/Anti-Marcion/Appendix: Against All Heresies/XII|Pseudo-Tertullian ''Haer''. 12]]; [[Philastrius|Philaster]], ''Haer''. 38).

==Achamōth==
The Italic school distinguished on the other hand a two-fold Sophia, the ''ano Sophia'' and the ''katō Sophia'' or Achamoth.

===Ptolemaeus===

====Fall====
According to the doctrine of [[Ptolemy (gnostic)|Ptolemaeus]] and that of his disciples, the former of these separates herself from her ''syzygos'', the ''thelētos'' through her audacious longing after immediate Communion with the Father of all, falls into a condition of suffering, and would completely melt away in this inordinate desire, unless the ''[[Valentinianism#Horos|Horos]]'' had purified her from her suffering and established her again in the Pleroma. Her ''enthymēsis'', on the other hand, the desire which has obtained the mastery over her and the consequent suffering becomes an ''amorphos kai aneideos ousia'', which is also called an ''ektrōma'', is separated from her and is assigned a place beyond the limits of the Pleroma.

====The place of the Midst====
From her dwelling-place above the Hebdomad, in the place of the Midst, she is also called [[Ogdoad (Gnosticism)|Ogdoad]] (Ὀγδοάς), and further entitled ''Mētēr'', ''Sophia'' also, and ''he [[Jerusalem|Hierousalēm]], Pneuma hagion'', and (''arsenikōs'') ''[[Kyrios]]''. In these names some partial reminiscences of the old Ophitic Gnosis are retained.

====Repentance====
The Achamoth first receives (by means of Christus and ''Pneuma hagion'' the Pair of Aeons within the Pleroma whose emanation is most recent), the ''morphōsis kat' ousian''. Left alone in her suffering she has become endued with penitent mind (''epistrophē''). Now descends the son as the common fruit of the Pleroma, gives her the ''morphōsis kata gnōsin'', and forms out of her various affections the Demiurge and the various constituents of this lower world. By his appointment the Achamoth produces the pneumatic seed (the ''ekklēsia'').

====Redemption====
The end of the world's history is here also (as above) the introduction of the lower Sophia with all her pneumatic offspring into the Pleroma, and this intimately connected with the second descent of the Soter and his transient union with the psychical Christus; then follows the marriage-union of the Achamoth with the Soter and of the pneumatic souls with the angels ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter VII.|Iren. i. 1-7]]; ''exc. ex Theod''. 43-65).

===Two-fold Sophia===
The same form of doctrine meets us also in Secundus, who is said to have been the first to have made the distinction of an upper and a lower Sophia ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XI.|Iren. i. 11, 2]]), and in the account which the ''Philosophumena'' give us of a system which most probably referred to the school of [[Heracleon]], and which also speaks of a double Sophia ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Refutation of All Heresies/Book VI|''Philos''. vi.]]). The name Jerusalem also for the ''exō Sophia'' meets us here ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Refutation of All Heresies/Book VI/Part 30|''Philos''. vi. 29]]). It finds its interpretation in the fragments of Heracleon (ap. Origen. ''in Joann.'' tom. x. 19). The name Achamoth, on the other hand, is wanting both in Hippolytus and in Heracleon. One school among the [[Marcosians]] seems also to have taught a two-fold Sophia ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XVI.|Iren. i. 16, 3]]; cf. [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXI.|21, 5]]).

===Etymology===
[[August Hahn]] (1819) debated whether the name ''Achamōth'' (Ἀχαμώθ) is originally derived from the Hebrew ''[[Chokhmah]]'' (חָכְמָ֑ה), in Aramaic ''Ḥachmūth'' or whether it signifies 'She that brings forth'—'Mother.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=August|last=Hahn|title=Bardesanes gnosticus, Syrorum primus hymnologus: commentatio historico-theologica|year=1819|page=64 sqq}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Syriac form ''Ḥachmūth'' is testified for us as used by [[Bardesanes]] (Ephraim, ''Hymn'' 55), the Greek form ''Hachamōth'' is found only among the Valentinians: the name however probably belongs to the oldest Syrian Gnosis.

==[[Bardesanes]]==
Cosmogonic myths play their part also in the doctrine of [[Bardesanes]]. The ''locus foedus'' whereon the gods (or Aeons) measured and founded Paradise (Ephraim, ''Hymn'' 55) is the same as the impure ''mētra'', which [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephraim]] is ashamed even to name (cf. also Ephraim, ''Hymn'' 14). The creation of the world is brought to pass through the son of the living one and the Rūha d' Qudshā, the Holy Spirit, with whom Ḥachmūth is identical, but in combination with "creatures," i.e. subordinate beings which co-operate with them (Ephraim, ''Hymn'' 3). It is not expressly so said, and yet at the same time is the most probable assumption, that as was the case with the father and mother so also their offspring the son of the Living One, and the Rūha d' Qudshā or Ḥachmūth, are to be regarded as a Syzygy. This last (the Ḥachmūth) brings forth the two daughters, the "Shame of the Dry Land" i.e. the ''mētra'', and the "Image of the Waters" i.e. the ''Aquatilis Corporis typus'', which is mentioned in connection with the Ophitic Sophia (Ephraim, ''Hymn'' 55). Beside which, in a passage evidently referring to Bardesanes, air, fire, water, and darkness are mentioned as aeons (Īthyē: ''Hymn'' 41) These are probably the "Creatures" to which in association with the Son and the Rūha d' Qudshā, Bardesanes is said to have assigned the creation of the world.

Though much still remains dark as to the doctrine of Bardesanes we cannot nevertheless have any right to set simply aside the statements of Ephraim, who remains the oldest Syrian source for our knowledge of the doctrine of this Syrian Gnostic, and deserves therefore our chief attentions. Bardesanes, according to Ephraim, is able also to tell of the wife or maiden who having sunk down from the Upper Paradise offers up prayers in her dereliction for help from above, and on being heard returns to the joys of the Upper Paradise (Ephraim, ''Hymn'' 55).

==''Acts of Thomas''==
These statements of Ephraim are further supplemented by the ''[[Acts of Thomas]]'' in which various hymns have been preserved which are either compositions of Bardesanes himself, or at any rate are productions of his school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard Adelbert|last= Lipsius|title=Apocrypha Apostelgeschichten|volume=I|pages=292–321|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ddJJAAAAMAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|year=1883|publisher=C.A. Schwetschke und sohn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hymn of the Pearl''===
In the Syriac text of the Acts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=William Wright (orientalist)|first=William|last=Wright|title=Apocryphal Acts of Apostles|year=1871|pages=238–245}}&lt;/ref&gt; we find the ''[[Hymn of the Pearl]]'', where the soul which has been sent down from her heavenly home to fetch the pearl guarded by the serpent, but has forgotten here below her heavenly mission until she is reminded of it by a letter from "the father, the mother, and the brother," performs her task, receives back again her glorious dress, and returns to her old home.

===''Ode to the Sophia''===
Of the other hymns which are preserved in the Greek version more faithfully than in the Syriac text which has undergone Catholic revision, the first deserving of notice is the ''Ode to the Sophia''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Alfred Maximilien Bonnet|first=Alfred Maximilien|last=Bonnet|title=Supplementum Codicis apocryphi|location=Leipsic|year=1883|volume=I|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XaUMAAAAIAAJ&amp;oe=UTF-8|title=The Wedding-Song of Wisdom|volume=Volume 11 of Echoes From the Gnosis|first=G.R.S.|last=Mead|publisher=Theosophical Publishing Society|year=1908|location=London and Benares}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes the marriage of the "maiden" with her heavenly bridegroom and her introduction into the Upper Realm of Light. This "maiden," called "daughter of light," is not as the Catholic reviser supposes the Church, but Ḥachmūth (Sophia) over whose head the "king," i.e. the father of the living ones, sits enthroned; her bridegroom is, according to the most probable interpretation, the son of the living one, i.e. Christ. With her the living Ones i.e. pneumatic souls enter into the Pleroma and receive the glorious light of the living Father and praise along with "the living spirit" the "father of truth" and the "mother of wisdom."

===First prayer of consecration===
The Sophia is also invoked in the first prayer of consecration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Maximilien Bonnet|Bonnet]], p. 20 sq.&lt;/ref&gt; She is there called the "merciful mother," the "consort of the masculine one," "revealant of the perfect mysteries," "Mother of the Seven Houses," "who finds rest in the eighth house," i.e. in the Ogdoad. In the second Prayer of Consecration&lt;ref&gt;Bonnet, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; she is also designated, the "perfect Mercy" and "Consort of the Masculine One," but is also called "Holy Spirit" (Syriac ''Rūha d' Qudshā'') "Revealant of the Mysteries of the whole Magnitude," "hidden Mother," "She who knows the Mysteries of the Elect," and "she who partakes in the conflicts of the noble Agonistes" (i.e. of Christ, cf. ''exc. ex Theod''. 58 ''ho megas agōnistēs Iēsous'').

There is further a direct reminiscence of the doctrine of Bardesanes when she is invoked as the Holy Dove which has given birth to the two twins, i.e. the two daughters of the Rūha d' Qudshā (ap. Ephraim, ''Hymn'' 55).

==''Pistis Sophia''==
A special and richly coloured development is given to the mythical form of the Sophia of the Gnostic Book ''[[Pistis Sophia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pistis sophia: opus gnosticum Valentino adiudicatum|editor1-first=Julius Heinrich|editor1-last=Petermann|editor2-first=Moritz Gotthilf|editor2-last=Schwartze|location=Berlin|year=1851}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two first books of this writing to which the name ''Pistis Sophia'' properly belongs, treat for the greater part (pp.&amp;nbsp;42–181) of the fall, the Repentance, and the Redemption of the Sophia.

===Fall===
She has by the ordinance of higher powers obtained an insight into the dwelling-place appropriated to her in the spiritual world, namely, the ''thēsauros lucis'' which lies beyond the XIIIth Aeon. By her endeavours to direct thither her upward flight, she draws upon herself the enmity of the ''Authadēs'', Archon of the XIIIth Aeon, and of the Archons of the XII Aeons under him; by these she is enticed down into the depths of chaos, and is there tormented in the greatest possible variety of ways, in order that she may thus incur the loss of her light-nature.

===Repentance===
In her utmost need she addresses thirteen penitent prayers (''metanoiai'') to the Upper Light. Step by step she is led upwards by Christus into the higher regions, though she still remains obnoxious to the assaults of the Archons, and is, after offering her XIIIth ''Metanoia'', more vehemently attacked than ever, until at length Christus leads her down into an intermediate place below the XIIIth Aeon, where she remains until the consummation of the world, and sends up grateful hymns of praise and thanksgiving.

===Redemption===
The earthly work of redemption having been at length accomplished, the Sophia returns to her original celestial home. The peculiar feature in this representation consists in the further development of the philosophical ideas which find general expression in the Sophia mythos. According to [[Karl Reinhold von Köstlin]] (1854), Sophia is here not merely, as with Valentinus, the representative of the longing which the finite spirit feels for the knowledge of the infinite, but at the same time a type or pattern of faith, of repentance, and of hope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Karl Reinhold von|last=Köstlin|title=Das Gnostische System des Buches Pistis Sophia''|editor1-last=Baur|editor1-first=F.C.|editor2-last=Zeller|editor2-first=Eduard|journal=Theol. Jahrbücher|year=1854|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her restoration she announces to her companions the twofold truth that, while every attempt to overstep the divinely ordained limits, has for its consequence suffering and punishment, so, on the other hand, the divine compassion is ever ready to vouchsafe pardon to the penitent.

===Light-Maiden===
We have a further reminiscence of the Sophia of the older Gnostic systems in what is said in the book ''Pistis Sophia'' of the Light-Maiden (''parthenos lucis''), who is there clearly distinguished from the Sophia herself, and appears as the archetype of [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]], the [[Constellation]] [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Reinhold von Köstlin|Köstlin]], p. 57 sq.&lt;/ref&gt; The station which she holds is in the place of the midst, above the habitation assigned to the Sophia in the XIIIth Aeon. She is the judge of (departed) souls, either opening for them or closing against them the portals of the light-realm (pp.&amp;nbsp;194–295). Under her stand yet seven other light-maidens with similar functions, who impart to pious souls their final consecrations (p.&amp;nbsp;291 sq. 327 sq. 334). From the place of the ''parthenos lucis'' comes the sun-dragon, which is daily borne along by four light-powers in the shape of white horses, and so makes his circuit round the earth (p.&amp;nbsp;183, cf. p.&amp;nbsp;18, 309).

==[[Manichaeism]]==
This light-maiden (''parthenos tou phōtos'') encounters us also among the [[Manichaeans]] as exciting the impure desires of the Daemons, and thereby setting free the light which has hitherto been held down by the power of darkness (''Dispuiat. Archelai et Manetis'', c. 8, n. 11; Theodoret., h. f. I. 26).&lt;ref&gt;Anathemat. Manich. ap. Cotelier on the ''Recogn.'' Clement IV., 27 ''et passim.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Johann Karl Thilo|editor-first=Johann Karl|editor-last=Thilo|title=Acta S. Thomae apostoli from the Paris Codex|location=Leipzig|publisher=Vogel|year=1823|page=128 sqq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Ferdinand Christian Baur|first=Ferdinand Christian|last=Baur|title=Die Manichäische Religionssystem|year=1831|page=219 sqq}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the place of the Gnostic Sophia is among Manichaeans taken by the "Mother of Life" (''mētēr tēs zōēs''), and by the [[Anima mundi|World-Soul]] (''psychē hapantōn''), which on occasions is distinguished from the Life-Mother, and is regarded as diffused through all living creatures, whose deliverance from the realm of darkness constitutes the whole of the world's history ([[Titus of Bostra]], ''adv. Manich''. I., 29, 36, ed. Lagarde, p.&amp;nbsp;17 sqq. 23; [[Alexander Lycopolitus]] c. 3; Epiphan. ''Haer''. 66, 24; ''Acta dispatat. Archelai et Manetis'', c. 7 sq. et passim).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Baur, p. 51 sqq. 64, 209.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gustav|last=Flügel|title=Mani, seine Lehren und seine Schriften. Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des Manichäismus|year=1862|page=201 sq. 210, 233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their return to the world of light is described in the famous ''Canticum Amatorium'' (ap. Augustin. c. Faust, iv. 5 sqq).

==[[Nag Hammadi]] texts==
In ''[[On the Origin of the World (Nag Hammadi)|On the Origin of the World]]'', Sophia is depicted as the ultimate destroyer of this material universe, [[Yaldabaoth]] and all his Heavens:

{{Quote|She [Sophia] will cast them down into the abyss. They [the Archons] will be obliterated because of their wickedness. For they will come to be like volcanoes and consume one another until they perish at the hand of the prime parent. When he has destroyed them, he will turn against himself and destroy himself until he ceases to exist. And their heavens will fall one upon the next and their forces will be consumed by fire. Their eternal realms, too, will be overturned. And his heaven will fall and break in two. His [...] will fall down upon the [...] support them; they will fall into the abyss, and the abyss will be overturned. The light will [...] the darkness and obliterate it: it will be like something that never was.}}

==Mythology==
[[Carl Jung]] linked the figure of Sophia to the highest archetype of the [[Anima and animus|anima]] in depth psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jung and the Human Psyche: An Understandable Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjCb8rbaaK8C&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ovVLPhNQK0&amp;sig=x2A_BlCyjg_mgolf1THqS9bZQe4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K486ULOgFvO_2QXD4oCYCA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2005|first=M.A.|last=Mattoon
|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis US|ISBN=1583911103|page=55 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archetypal fall and recovery of Sophia is additionally linked (to a varying degree) to many different myths and stories (see [[damsel in distress]]). Among these are:
*[[Isis]], who while still in the cosmic womb, brings forth the flawed Elder [[Horus]] without a consort&lt;ref&gt;As told by [[Plutarch]], [http://sacred-texts.com/gno/th1/th136.htm ''On the Worship of Isis and Osiris'', LIV, 5-6]. See {{Citation | authorlink = G.R.S. Mead | last = Mead | first = G.R.S | title = Thrice Greatest Hermes: Studies in Hellenistic Theosophy and Gnosis|volume=I |location=London and Benares|publisher=The Theosophical Publishing Society| year = 1906 | url = http://sacred-texts.com/gno/th1/index.htm|page=334, note}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The abduction and rescue of [[Helen of Troy]]
*[[Persephone]] and her descent into [[Hades]], from which she returns to life [but is bound to return to Hades for 6 months every year]
*The fall of [[Eve]] and the birth of Christ through the [[Virgin Mary]]
*The descent of [[Orpheus]] into the underworld to rescue his wife, [[Eurydice]]
*The return of [[Odysseus]] to his kingdom, [[Ithaca]], to reclaim his wife, [[Penelope]]
*The rescue of [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] by [[Perseus]]
*[[Ishtar]]'s descent to the Underworld, in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]
*[[Pandora]]
* [[Cinderella]] and [[Sleeping Beauty]]
*The [[Saint George and the Dragon|slaying of the Dragon]] by [[St. George]] to rescue the Princess
*The rescue of the kidnapped [[Sita]] by her husband, the god-king [[Rama]], with the help of [[Hanuman]] in the [[Ramayana]]

Note that many of these myths have alternative psychological interpretations.  For example, Jungian psychologist [[Marie-Louise von Franz]] interpreted fairy tales like Sleeping Beauty as symbolizing the 'rescue' or reintegration of the [[anima and animus|anima]], the more 'feminine' part of a man's unconscious,  but not wisdom or ''sophia'' per se.

'''The Australian [[v:English literary canon|Canon]]''' refers to those texts by Australian authors that espouse the values of [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/canonicity canonicity]. These values are dynamic and contentious but may generally be said to include: timelessness, universal concerns, a unique Australian identity, an authentic representation of what it means to be 'Australian'.

Contentious concerns include the emergence of a distinctive Australian literature and arguments about contending literary canons, including the relation between ‘generational canons’, ‘middlebrow’ and ‘academic’ canons, the ‘syllabus’ and the ‘canonical imaginary’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/courses/uos/ENGL6991|title=Course Search - The University of Sydney|website=sydney.edu.au|access-date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[s:While the Billy Boils|Lawson, Henry, ''While the Billy Boils'', (1896)]]

[[My Brilliant Career|Franklin, Miles, ''My Brilliant Career'', (1901)]]

== Contentiousness ==

David Carter writes:

As a value-laden rather than neutral descriptive term, "Australian literature" is more likely to b e contentious than consensual; ironically it has often been contentious precisely because it has functioned to represent one version of consensus against another. Not only do definitions of Australian literature shift over time, at any one time different and potentially conflicting definitions will be operating across the various sites and layers of the culture. The idea of Australian literature is better understood, then, in one of the telling, if excessively self-dramatising phrases of recent criticism, as a "site of struggle" where these different definitions or institutional effects are given social and material form. It is political, therefore, because much more are at stake than competing individual literary tastes, or at least there may be under certain social and institutional conditions. The precise relationship between the institutional politics within literature and politics beyond the institution has more often been mystified than clarified.

==Plot==
Elisa Esposito ([[Sally Hawkins]]) who was found abandoned as a child by the side of a river with wounds on her neck, is [[Muteness|mute]] and communicates through [[Sign language|sign language]]. She lives alone in an apartment above a cinema and works as a cleaner at a secret government laboratory in Baltimore, Maryland, at the height of the [[Cold War]]. Her only friends are her [[Closeted|closeted]] next-door neighbor Giles ([[Richard Jenkins]]) a middle-aged struggling advertising illustrator and Zelda ([[Octavia Spencer]]) a co-worker who serves as her interpreter.

The facility receives a mysterious creature captured from the [[Amazon River]] by Colonel Richard Strickland ([[Michael Shannon]]) who is in charge of the project to study it. Believing it is just a wild beast, Strickland treats it brutally, repeatedly shocking it with his electric [[Cattle prod|cattle prod]]. Curious about the creature, Elisa discovers it is a male humanoid amphibian ([[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]]). She begins visiting him in secret and the two form a close bond as she teaches him sign language.

Seeking to exploit the Amphibian Man for an American advantage in the [[Space Race|space race]], General Frank Hoyt ([[Nick Searcy]]) is eventually persuaded by Strickland to [[Vivisection|vivisect]] it. One scientist, Robert Hoffstetler ([[Michael Stuhlbarg]]) - who is really a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spy named Dimitri Mosenkov - pleads unsuccessfully to keep the Amphibian Man alive for further study and, at the same time, is ordered by his Soviet handlers to [[Euthanasia|euthanize]] the creature. When Elisa overhears the American plans for the Amphibian Man, she persuades Giles to help her free him. Hoffstetler stumbles upon Elisa's plot in progress and chooses to help her. Though initially reluctant, Zelda also becomes involved in the successful escape.

Elisa keeps the Amphibian Man in her bathtub. She plans to release him into a nearby canal when it rains to give access to the ocean in several days' time. Strickland interrogates Elisa and Zelda, among others, but learns nothing. Back at the apartment, Giles discovers the Amphibian Man devouring one of his cats. Startled, the Amphibian Man slashes Giles's arm and rushes out of the apartment. He gets as far as the cinema downstairs, luckily empty of patrons, before Elisa finds him and returns him to her apartment. He touches Giles on his balding head and his wounded arm, and the next morning Giles discovers his hair has begun growing back and the wounds on his arm have healed. After initially walking away, Elisa has sex with the Amphibian Man in her shower. For a later encounter, she fills the bathroom completely with water, which eventually begins to cause water to drip into the theater below. The upset theater owner alerts Giles, who then enters the apartment and opens the bathroom door, interrupting the tryst.

Hoyt unexpectedly arrives and asks for the status of the case. When Strickland questions how much experimentation is enough, he is told he has 36 hours to recover the Amphibian Man or his career and life will be over. Meanwhile, Hoffstetler is told he will be [[Extraction (military)|extracted]] in two days. As the planned release date approaches, the Amphibian Man's health starts deteriorating. Hoffstetler goes to meet his handlers with Strickland tailing him. At the rendezvous, Hoffstetler is shot by a handler before Strickland kills him and then continuously tortures Hoffstetler for information (knowing he is a spy by virtue of having heard him speak Russian to his handler) while asking for the name and rank of who has the creature. Before dying, Hoffstetler implicates Elisa and Zelda. Strickland savagely threatens Zelda in her home until her husband Brewster (Martin Roach) reveals that Elisa has the Amphibian Man (having overheard her conversations). After Strickland's departure, Zelda immediately calls Elisa, warning her to get the creature out immediately. An enraged Strickland arrives and searches Elisa's empty apartment until he finds a calendar note revealing where she plans to release the Amphibian Man.

At the canal, Elisa and Giles are bidding farewell to the creature when Strickland arrives, knocks Giles down, and shoots the Amphibian Man and Elisa. The Amphibian Man quickly heals himself and slashes Strickland's throat, killing him. As police arrive on the scene with Zelda, the Amphibian Man takes Elisa and jumps into the canal, where he heals her. When he applies his healing touch to the scars on Elisa's neck, they open to reveal [[Gill|gills]] like his; she jolts back to life, and the two embrace. In a closing [[Voice-over|voice-over]] narration, Giles conveys his belief that Elisa lived "happily ever after in love" with the Amphibian Man.

Del Toro set the film during the 1960s Cold War era to counteract today's heightened tensions, specifying, "if I say once upon a time in 1962, it becomes a fairy tale for troubled times. People can lower their guard a little bit more and listen to the story and listen to the characters and talk about the issues, rather than the circumstances of the issues."&lt;ref name=MNDaily&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Bennett |first=Haley |authorlink=Haley Bennett|title='Review: The Shape of Water' Mermaid film noir sounds like a fishy genre, but director Guillermo del Toro navigates it with skill.|url=http://www.mndaily.com/article/2017/12/a-review-the-shape-of-water|work=[[Minnesota Daily]]|date=December 15, 2017 |access-date=December 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===

A fan of her performances in ''[[Happy-Go-Lucky]]'' and ''[[Fingersmith (TV serial)|Fingersmith]]'', Del Toro wrote the script with [[Sally Hawkins]] in mind for the part and pitched the idea to her while intoxicated at the [[2014 Golden Globes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Lee|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/11/how-guillermo-del-toro-cast-sally-hawkins-in-shape-of-water.html|title=How Guillermo del Toro Got Drunk at a Golden Globes After-party and Made Sally Hawkins the Star of The Shape of Water|publisher=Vulture|date=November 30, 2017|access-date=July 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710101859/http://www.vulture.com/2017/11/how-guillermo-del-toro-cast-sally-hawkins-in-shape-of-water.html#|archive-date=July 10, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkins prepared for the role by watching films of silent comedians [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Harold Lloyd]] and was told by Del Toro to watch [[Stan Laurel]] from [[Laurel and Hardy]], whom Del Toro thought was capable of doing a "state of grace without conveying it verbally".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/guillermo-del-toro-the-shape-of-water-fairy-tale-sally-hawkins-richard-jenkins-complete-interview-transcript-news|title=Guillermo del Toro ('The Shape of Water'): 'A fairy tale for troubled times' [Complete Interview Transcript]|last=Beachum|first=Chris|last2=Dixon|first2=Marcus James|date=December 26, 2017|website=GoldDerby|publisher=|access-date=July 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710102211/https://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/guillermo-del-toro-the-shape-of-water-fairy-tale-sally-hawkins-richard-jenkins-complete-interview-transcript-news/#|archive-date=July 10, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The part of Giles was originally written with [[Ian McKellen]] in mind and Del Toro was inspired to do so by his performance as the real-life closeted gay filmmaker [[James Whale]] who directed ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' and ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', who found himself unemployable in his later years. When McKellen proved unavailable, Del Toro sent an e-mail to [[Richard Jenkins]], who accepted the part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Patrick|last=Shanley|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/michael-shannon-getting-into-character-shape-of-water|title='Shape of Water' Star Richard Jenkins on Getting Cast Via Email|publisher=Hollywood Reporter|date=February 22, 2018|access-date=July 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180610181536/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/michael-shannon-getting-into-character-shape-of-water#|archive-date=June 10, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shannon]] was cast as Richard Strickland, the villain of the film. According to an interview with Vanity Fair, Shannon and Del Toro had early conversations about the notion that Strickland would have been the hero of the film if it had been made in the 1950s, something that fascinated the actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Julie|last=Miller|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/michael-shannon-getting-into-character-shape-of-water|title=For Michael Shannon, the Clothes Made the Man in The Shape of Water|publisher=Vanity Fair|date=December 5, 2017|access-date=July 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180610181536/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/michael-shannon-getting-into-character-shape-of-water#|archive-date=June 10, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Octavia Spencer]], who played the role of Elisa's co-worker, friend and interpreter Zelda found it funny that the people Del Toro used to speak for the mute main character were people who represent very disenfranchised groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Beachum|url=https://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/octavia-spencer-the-shape-of-water-guillermo-del-toro-sally-hawkins-complete-interview-transcript-video-news/|title=Octavia Spencer ('The Shape of Water'): 'Otherworldly and beautiful' themes are 'very relevant for today' [Complete Interview Transcript]|publisher=GoldDerby|date=December 28, 2017|access-date=July 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710102032/https://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/octavia-spencer-the-shape-of-water-guillermo-del-toro-sally-hawkins-complete-interview-transcript-video-news/#|archive-date=July 10, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visuals===

According to an interview with ''[[The Wrap]]'', Guillermo Del Toro was torn between making the film in color or in black and white, and was at one point leaning toward the latter. [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] offered Del Toro either a $20 million budget to make the film in color or a $17 million budget to shoot it in black and white. "That was honestly a battle I was expecting to lose," Del Toro said to ''The Wrap''. "I was of two minds. On one hand I thought black and white would look luscious, but on the other hand I thought it would look postmodern, like I was being reflective rather than immersed. It's good, because it got me three million more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Pond |url=https://www.thewrap.com/how-guillermo-del-toro-made-five-movies-in-one-with-the-shape-of-water/ |title='Guillermo del Toro on How 'The Shape of Water' Was Almost Shot in Black and White |publisher=The Wrap |date=January 23, 2018 |access-date=July 10, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710102012/https://www.thewrap.com/how-guillermo-del-toro-made-five-movies-in-one-with-the-shape-of-water/# |archive-date=July 10, 2018 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, [[Rex Reed]] of the ''[[New York Observer]]'' gave the film 1 out of 4 stars and calling it "a loopy, lunkheaded load of drivel" and, referring to Hawkins's role in ''[[Maudie (film)|Maudie]]'', described people with disabilities as "defective creatures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2017/12/review-sally-hawkins-sinks-in-guillermo-del-toros-the-shape-of-water/|title=One Star: ''The Shape of Water'' Is a Loopy, Lunkheaded Load of Drivel|publisher=[[New York Observer]]|first=Rex|last=Reed|authorlink=Rex Reed|date=December 19, 2017|access-date=January 7, 2018|archive-url=https://archive.today/20171220220654/http://observer.com/2017/12/review-sally-hawkins-sinks-in-guillermo-del-toros-the-shape-of-water/#|archive-date=December 20, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reed's review was criticized for referring to Sally Hawkins' mute character as "mentally handicapped" and for erroneously crediting actor [[Benicio del Toro]] as the film's director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2017/12/guillermo-del-toro-rex-reed-shape-of-water-review-benicio-1201909629/|title=Rex Reed's Negative 'The Shape of Water' Review Goes Viral After Crediting Benicio del Toro as Director|publisher=[[IndieWire]]|first=Zack|last=Sharf|date=December 20, 2017|access-date=March 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306023706/https://www.indiewire.com/2017/12/guillermo-del-toro-rex-reed-shape-of-water-review-benicio-1201909629/#|archive-date=March 6, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
{{see also|List of accolades received by The Shape of Water}}
''The Shape of Water'' received 13 nominations at the 90th [[Academy Awards]], the most of any film in the 2018 race. It won in four categories: [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]], Best Original Score, [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].

The film also spawned some debate about whether the fact that it was filmed in Canada, with a predominantly Canadian crew and many Canadian actors in the supporting roles, should have made it eligible to be nominated for the [[Canadian Screen Awards]]. Under [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television]] rules, to qualify for CSA nominations under the rules for international coproductions at least 15 per cent of a film's funding must come from a Canadian film studio. Even the film's Canadian co-producer, [[J. Miles Dale]], stated that he supports the rules and does not believe the film should have been eligible.&lt;ref name="toocanadian"&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2018/03/08/are-the-canadian-screen-awards-too-canadian.html "Are the Canadian Screen Awards too Canadian?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309140451/https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2018/03/08/are-the-canadian-screen-awards-too-canadian.html# |date=March 9, 2018 }}. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', March 8, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuit alleging plagiarism===
In February 2018, the estate of [[Paul Zindel]] initiated a lawsuit in [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] against director Guillermo del Toro and associate producer Daniel Kraus, alleging that ''The Shape of Water'' "brazenly copies the story, elements, characters, and themes" of Zindel's 1969 work ''[[Let Me Hear You Whisper (play)|Let Me Hear You Whisper]]'', which depicts a cleaning lady bonding with a dolphin and attempting to rescue it from a secret research laboratory's nefarious uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/22/587902480/shape-of-water-creators-sued-over-plagiarism-claims-as-oscars-approach|title='Shape Of Water' Creators Sued Over Plagiarism Claims As Oscars Approach|publisher=|access-date=February 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223144801/https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/22/587902480/shape-of-water-creators-sued-over-plagiarism-claims-as-oscars-approach#|archive-date=February 23, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint spends more than a dozen pages detailing alleged "overwhelming similarities" between the works.&lt;ref&gt;Eliza Berman, [http://time.com/5170613/shape-of-water-plagiarism-controversy/ Everything to Know About the Shape of Water Plagiarism Controversy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305053610/http://time.com/5170613/shape-of-water-plagiarism-controversy/# |date=March 5, 2018 }}, ''Time'' (March 1, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

Del Toro denied the claim of the Zindel estate, saying that "I have never read nor seen the play. I'd never heard of this play before making ''The Shape of Water,'' and none of my collaborators ever mentioned the play." Distributor [[Fox Searchlight]] also denied the claim and said that it would "vigorously defend" itself in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Colin Dwyer|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/22/587902480/shape-of-water-creators-sued-over-plagiarism-claims-as-oscars-approach|title='Shape of Water' Creators Sued Over Plagiarism Claims As Oscars Approach|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=February 23, 2018|access-date=February 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223144801/https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/22/587902480/shape-of-water-creators-sued-over-plagiarism-claims-as-oscars-approach#|archive-date=February 23, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Judge Percy Anderson dismissed the suit and stated that del Toro and Fox Searchlight were entitled to recover their legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chmielewski|first=Dawn C.|title=Judge Dismisses 'Shape Of Water' Lawsuit Waged During Final Oscar Voting Against Guillermo Del Toro's Best Picture Winner|url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/shape-of-water-lawsuit-dismissed-guillermo-del-toro-oscar-best-picture-copyright-1202432680/|publisher=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|date=July 24, 2018|access-date=July 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724215810/https://deadline.com/2018/07/shape-of-water-lawsuit-dismissed-guillermo-del-toro-oscar-best-picture-copyright-1202432680/#|archive-date=July 24, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shape of Water was also accused by a French director of [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/10/director-oscar-favourite-shape-water-accused-copying-scenes/ copying scenes] from the romantic comedy Amelie and the cult classic Delicatessen&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/10/director-oscar-favourite-shape-water-accused-copying-scenes/&lt;/ref&gt;.
Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s black comedy Delicatessen was released in 1991 and quickly became a cult classic, but it was his whimsical take on life and love in the picturesque Paris district of Montmartre, Amelie, that gave him his first global hit.

He claims fellow director Guillermo del Toro was clearly plagiarising one of his scenes in The Shape of Water when he has the characters played by British actor Sally Hawkins and Richard Jenkins perform a two-step dance while sitting on a sofa watching an old Hollywood movie.

There are some very strong similarities in the saturation of the colours, overall art direction and the use of anthropomorphic objects. The music is reminiscent of Yann Tiersen's soundtrack for Amelie.

"When [Guillermo del Toro] steals the scene of the couple sitting on the edge of the bed dancing with their feet, with the musical on telly in the background, it is so cut and pasted from Delicatessen that there’s a moment when I say to myself that he lacks self-respect," said Mr Jeunet.
“It is obvious that he had ‘Delicatessen’ in mind,” he said.

“I’m not going to sue him for plagiarism, that’s not my style. But Guillermo has enough talent not to be doing things like that,” he told Ouest-France newspaper&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ouest-france.fr/culture/la-forme-de-l-eau-jean-pierre-jeunet-accuse-guillermo-del-toro-de-copier-coller-delicatessen-5548366&lt;/ref&gt;.

Mr Jeunet said he emailed the Mexican director to ask him why he was stealing his ideas.
“He replied.. that he did not steal from others, that it was [American director] Terry Gilliam who influenced all of us,” he said

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44933">The '''Theory of Reasoned Action''' ('''ToRA''' or '''TRA''') aims to explain the relationship between attitudes and behaviors within human action. It is mainly used to predict how individuals will behave based on their pre-existing attitudes and behavioral intentions. An individual's decision to engage in a particular behavior is based on the outcomes the individual expects will come as a result of performing the behavior. Developed by Martin Fishbein and [[Icek Ajzen]] in 1967, the theory derived from previous research in [[Social psychology (sociology)|social psychology]], persuasion models, and attitude theories. Fisbein's theories suggested a relationship between attitude and behaviors (the A-B relationship). However, critics estimated that attitude theories were not proving to be good indicators of human behavior. The ToRA was later revised and expanded by the two theorists in the following decades to overcome any discrepancies in the A-B relationship with the [[Theory of planned behavior|Theory of Planned Behavior]] (TPB) and [[Reasoned action approach|Reasoned Action Approach]] (RAA). The theory is also used in communication discourse as a theory of understanding. &lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogers Gillmore|first=Mary|last2=Archibald|first2=Matthew|last3=Morrison|first3=Diane|last4=Wilsdon|first4=Anthony|last5=Wells|first5=Elizabeth|last6=Hoppe|first6=Marilyn|last7=Nahom|first7=Deborah|last8=Murowchick|first8=Elise|date=November 2002|title=Teen Sexual Behavior: Applicability of the Theory of Reasoned Action|url=|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=64|issue=Volume 64|pages=885–897|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2002.00885.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary purpose of the TRA is to understand an individual's voluntary behavior by examining the underlying basic motivation to perform an action&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doswell|first=Willa|last2=Braxter|first2=Betty|last3=Cha|first3=EunSeok|last4=Kim|first4=Kevin|date=2011|title=Testing the Theory of Reasoned Action in Explaining Sexual Behavior Among African American Young Teen Girls|url=|journal=Journal of Pediatric Nursing|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; . ToRA states that a person's intention to perform a behavior is the main predictor of whether or not they actually perform that behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/904400161|title=Health behavior : theory, research, and practice|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Glanz, Karen,, Rimer, Barbara K.,, Viswanath, K.

According to the theory, intention to perform a certain behavior precedes the actual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Azjen|first=Icek|last2=Madden|first2=Thomas|date=1986|title=Prediction of goal-directed behavior: Attitudes, intentions, and perceived behavioral control|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=22|pages=453–474|doi=10.1016/0022-1031(86)90045-4|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This intention is known as behavioral intention and comes as a result of a belief that performing the behavior will lead to a specific outcome. Behavioral intention is important to the theory because these intentions "are determined by attitudes to behaviors and subjective norms".&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colman|first=Andrew|date=January 2015|title=Theory of Reasoned Action|url=|journal=A Dictionary of Psychology|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of reasoned action suggests that stronger intentions lead to increased effort to perform the behavior, which also increases the likelihood for the behavior to be performed. 

== Key Concepts and Conditions ==
=== Behavior ===
A [[Positivism|positivistic approach]] to behavior research, ToRA attempts to predict and explain one's intention of performing a certain behavior. The theory requires that behavior be clearly defined in terms of the four following concepts: Action (e.g. to go get), Target (e.g. a mammogram), Context (e.g. at the breast screening center), and Time (e.g. in the 12 months).&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Montaño, DE, Kasprzyk, D, and Taplin, S. The Theory of Reasoned Action and the Theory of Planned Behavior. In: Glanz, K, Lewis, FM, and Rimer, BK (Eds). Health Behavior and Health Education (Second Edition). San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass Publishers.    &lt;/ref&gt; According to TRA, behavioral intention is the main motivator of behavior, while the two key determinants on behavioral intention are people's ''attitudes'' and ''norms''. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Fishbein, Martin, and Icek Ajzen. ''Belief, Attitude, Intention And Behavior''. Addison-Wesley, 1975.    &lt;/ref&gt; By examining attitudes and subjective norms, researchers can gain an understanding as to whether or not one will perform the intended action. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

=== Attitudes ===
According to TRA, ''attitudes'' are one of the key determinants of behavioral intention and refer to the way people feel towards a particular behavior. &lt;ref name=":15"&gt;Ajzen, I., &amp; Albarracín, D. (2007). Predicting and changing behavior: A reasoned action approach. In I. Ajzen, D. Albarracín, &amp; R. Hornik (Eds.), ''Prediction and change of health behavior: Applying the reasoned action approach'' (pp. 3-21). Mahwah, NJ, US: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; These attitudes are influenced by two factors: the ''strength of behavioral beliefs'' regarding the outcomes of the performed behavior (i.e. whether or not the outcome is probable) and the ''evaluation'' of the potential outcomes (i.e. whether or not the outcome is positive). &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Attitudes regarding a certain behavior can either be positive, negative or neutral. &lt;ref name=":16"&gt;Fishbein, M. (1967). A behavior theory approach to the relations between beliefs about an object and the attitude toward the object. In M. Fishbein (Ed.), Readings in attitude theory and measurement (pp. 389-400). New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons.    &lt;/ref&gt; The theory stipulates that there exists a direct correlation between attitudes and outcomes, such that if one believes that a certain behavior will lead to a desirable or ''favorable'' outcome, then one is more likely to have a positive attitude towards the behavior. Alternatively, if one believes that a certain behavior will lead to an undesirable or ''unfavorable'' outcome, then one is more likely to have a negative attitude towards the behavior. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

==== Behavioral Belief ====
''Behavioral belief'' allows us to understand people's motivations for their behavior in terms of the behavior's consequences. &lt;ref&gt;Ajzen, Icek. “Martin Fishbein's Legacy: The Reasoned Action Approach.” ''The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', vol. 640, 2012, pp. 11–27. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/23218420.    &lt;/ref&gt; This concept stipulates that people tend to associate the performance of a certain behavior with a certain set of outcomes or features. &lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; For example, a person believes that if he or she studies for a month for his or her driver's license test, that one will pass the test after failing it the first time without studying at all. Here, the behavioral belief is that studying for a month is equated with success, whereas not studying at all is associated with failure. 

==== Evaluation ====
The evaluation of the outcome refers to the way people perceive and evaluate the potential outcomes of a performed behavior. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such evaluations are conceived in a binary "good-bad" fashion-like manner. &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; For example, a person may evaluate the outcome of quitting smoking cigarettes as positive if the behavioral belief is improved breathing and clean lungs. Conversely, a person may evaluate the outcome of quitting smoking cigarettes as negative if the behavioral belief is weight gain after smoking cessation. 

=== Subjective Norms ===
''Subjective norms'' are also one of the key determinants of behavioral intention and refer to the way [[Perception|perceptions]] of relevant groups or individuals such as family members, friends, and peers may affect one's performance of the behavior. &lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; [[Icek Ajzen|Ajzen]] defines subjective norms as the "perceived [[social pressure]] to perform or not perform the behavior". &lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; According to TRA, people develop certain beliefs or ''normative beliefs'' as to whether or not certain behaviors are acceptable. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These beliefs shape one's [[perception]] of the behavior and determine one's intention to perform or not perform the behavior. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; For example, if one believes that recreational drug use (the behavior) is acceptable within one's social group, one will more likely be willing to engage in the activity. Alternatively, if one's friends groups perceive that the behavior is bad, one will be less likely to engage in recreational drug use. However, subjective norms also take into account people's ''motivation to comply'' with their social circle's views and [[Perception|perceptions]], which vary depending on the situation and the individual's motivations. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==== Normative Beliefs ====
Normative beliefs touch on whether or not referent relevant groups approve of the action. There exists a direct correlation between normative beliefs and performance of the behavior. Usually, the more likely the referent groups will approve of the action, the more likely the individual perform the act. Conversely, the less likely the referent groups will approve of the action, the less likely the individual will perform the act. &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

==== Motivation to Comply ====
Motivation to comply addresses the fact that individuals may or may not comply with [[Social norm|social norms]] of the referent groups surrounding the act. Depending on the individuals motivations in terms of adhering to [[Social pressure|social pressures]], the individual will either succumb to the [[Social pressure|social pressures]] of performing the act if it is deemed acceptable, or alternatively will resist to the [[Social pressure|social pressures]] of performing the act if it is deemed unacceptable. &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Behavioral Intention ===
Behavioral intention is a function of both attitudes and subjective norms toward that behavior (also known as the normative component). Attitudes being how strongly one holds the attitude toward the act and subjective norms being the social norms associated with the act. The stronger the attitude and the more positive the subjective norm, the higher the A-B relationship should be. However, the attitudes and subjective norms are unlikely to be weighted equally in predicting behavior. Depending on the individual and situation, these factors might have different impacts on behavioral intention, thus a weight is associated with each of these factors.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Communication Theories:  Perspectives, Processes, and Contexts|last=Miller|first=Katherine|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York City|pages=126|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few studies have shown that direct prior experience with a certain activity results in an increased weight on the attitude component of the behavior intention function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manstead|first=A. S.|last2=Proffitt|first2=Christine|last3=Smart|first3=J. L.|title=Predicting and understanding mothers' infant-feeding intentions and behavior: Testing the theory of reasoned action.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.44.4.657|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=44|issue=4|pages=657–671|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.44.4.657|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Formula====
In its simplest form, the TRA can be expressed as the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt;BI {{=}} (AB)W_1 + (SN)W_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''BI'' = behavioral intention
* (''AB'') = one's attitude toward performing the behavior
* ''W'' = empirically derived weights
* ''SN'' = one's subjective norm related to performing the behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hale|first=Jerold|last2=Householder|first2=Brian|last3=Greene|first3=Kathryn|date=2002|title=The Theory of Reasoned Action|url=|journal=The persuasion handbook: Developments in theory and practice|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conditions ===
The TORA theorists note that there are three conditions that can affect the relationship between behavioral intention and behavior. The first condition is that "the measure of intention must correspond with respect to their levels of specificity".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Comparison of the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Theory of Reasoned Action|last = Ajzen|first = Icek|date = February 1992|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|doi = 10.1177/0146167292181001|pmid =|volume=18|pages=3–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that to predict a specific behavior, the behavioral intention must be equally specific. The second condition is that there must be "stability of intentions between time of measurement and performance of behavior".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The intention must remain the same between the time that it is given and the time that the behavior is performed. The third condition is "the degree to which carrying out the intention is under the volitional control of the individual".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The individual always has the control of whether or not to perform the behavior. These conditions have to do with the transition from verbal responses to actual behavior.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Scope and Limitations ==

=== Scope ===
While Fishbein and [[Icek Ajzen|Ajzen]] developed the ToRA within the field of health to understand health behaviors, the theorists asserted that TRA could be applied in any given context to understand and even predict any human behavior. &lt;ref&gt;Fishbein, Martin, and Icek Ajzen. ''Belief, Attitude, Intention And Behavior''. Addison-Wesley, 1975.   &lt;/ref&gt; According to Sheppard et al., behavioral intention can predict the performance of "any voluntary act, unless intent changes prior to the performance or unless the intention measure does not correspond to the behavioral criterion in terms of action, target, context, time-frame and/or specificity". &lt;ref name=":17"&gt;Sheppard, Blair H. et al. "The Theory Of Reasoned Action: A Meta-Analysis Of Past Research With Recommendations For Modifications And Future Research". ''Journal Of Consumer Research'', vol 15, no. 3, 1988, p. 325. ''Oxford University Press (OUP)'', doi:10.1086/209170.&lt;/ref&gt; Their statement asserts that according to TRA, the measure of behavioral intention can predict whether or not an individual will preform a certain act, as long as the behavioral intention remains the same and the behavior is clearly and properly defined. &lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Broadening the scope of TRA, Sheppard conducted a study in which they applied TRA in situations that did not completely comply or conform with Fishbein and [[Icek Ajzen|Ajzen]]'s framework. Surveying 87 previous empirical studies, they applied the theory in contexts where the individual did not have full [[Volition (psychology)|volitional]] control over the behavior and/or where individuals did not have all the information to develop the intention.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;Pinder, Craig C. ''Work Motivation In Organizational Behavior''. Psychology Press, 2008, pp. 253 - 266.&lt;/ref&gt; To their surprise, they found that the theory of reasoned action could successfully be applied in situations that did not fully adhere to the three formal terms and conditions specified by the theory. &lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

=== Limitations ===
Although the scope of TRA is wide, the theory still has its limitations and like any other theory, needs constant refinement and revision particularly when extending to choice and goals. &lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; The distinction between a goal intention and a behavioral intention concerns the capability to achieve one's intention, which involves multiple variables thus creating great uncertainty. [[Icek Ajzen|Ajzen]] acknowledged that "some behaviors are more likely to present problems of controls than others, but we can never be absolutely certain that we will be in a position to carry out our intentions. Viewed in this light it becomes clear that strictly speaking every intention is a goal whose attainment is subject to some degree of uncertainty." &lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

According to Eagly and Chaiken, TRA does not take into account that certain conditions that enable the performance of a behavior are not available to individuals. &lt;ref name=":19"&gt;Eagly, A. H., &amp; Chaiken, S. (1993). The psychology of attitudes. Orlando, FL, US: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich College Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ToRA focuses on behaviors that people decisively enact, the theory is limited in terms of being able to predict behaviors that require access to certain opportunities, skills, conditions, and/or resources. &lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Additionally, certain intentions do not necessarily play a role in terms of connecting attitudes and behavior. &lt;ref name=":20"&gt;Bagozzi, Richard P. et al. "An Investigation Into The Role Of Intentions As Mediators Of The Attitude-Behavior Relationship". ''Journal Of Economic Psychology'', vol 10, no. 1, 1989, pp. 35-62. ''Elsevier BV'', doi:10.1016/0167-4870(89)90056-1.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study conducted by Bagozzi and Yi, the performance of a behavior is not always preceded by a strong intent. In fact, attitudes and behaviors may not always be linked by intentions, particularly when the behavior does not require much cognitive effort. &lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

== Development and investigation ==
In 1979, [[H. C. Triandis]] proposed expanding TORA to include more components. These factors were habit, facilitating conditions, and affect. When a person performs a behavior in a routine manner they form a habit. Facilitating conditions are conditions that make completion of an action more or less difficult. Both of these conditions affect their behavior directly. On the other hand, affect is the emotional response a person has towards a behavior and this emotional response only affects behavioral intention rather than directly affecting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authorlink1=Harry C. Triandis|last1=Triandis|first1=Harry C.|date=1979|title=Values, attitudes, and interpersonal behavior|url=|journal=Nebraska Symposium on Motivation|volume=27|pages=195–259|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expanded version of TORA has been used to study behaviors like women's participation in [[mammography]] procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montano|first=Daniel E.|last2=Taplin|first2=Stephen H.|title=A test of an expanded theory of reasoned action to predict mammography participation|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(91)90153-4|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=32|issue=6|pages=733–741|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(91)90153-4|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Ajzen extended TORA to what he refers as the [[theory of planned behavior]] (TPB). This involves the addition of one major predictor—perceived behavioral control.

== Applications of the theory  ==
The theory of reasoned action has been used in many studies as a framework for examining specific kinds of behavior such as communication behavior, consumer behavior and health behavior. Many researchers use the theory to study behaviors that are associated with high risks and danger, as well as deviant behavior. In contrast, some research has applied the theory to more normative and rational types of action. Researchers Davies, Foxall, and Pallister suggest that the theory of reasoned action can be tested if "behavior is measured objectively without drawing a connection to prior intention".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Explaining Internet Banking Behavior: Theory of reasoned action, theory of planned behavior, or technology acceptance model?|last = Yousafzai|first = Shumaila|date = 2010|journal = Journal of Applied Psychology|doi = 10.1111/j.1559-1816.2010.00615.x|volume=40|pages=1172–1202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most studies, however, look at intention because of its central role in the theory.

=== Communication ===

==== College fraternity and sorority hazing ====
Theory of Reasoned Action has been applied to the study of [[Whistle blowing|whistle-blowing]] intentions and [[hazing]] in college organizations, specifically [[fraternities and sororities]]. Hazing is understood to be "any activity expected of someone that joins a group, which humiliates, degrades, abuses or endangers its victims".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Blowing the Whistle Against Greek Hazing: The Theory of Reasoned Action as a Framework for Reporting Intentions|last = Richardson|first = Brian|date = April–June 2012|journal = Communication Studies|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Wang|first2 = Zuoming|last3 = Hall|first3 = Camille}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, there have been a variety of hazing incidents that have resulted in death and harm of students on several college campuses. Whistle-blowing "involves an individual with some level of unique or inside knowledge using public communication to bring attention to some perceived wrongdoing or problem.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Whistle-blowing is significant to this issue because individuals who are aware of hazing incidents can come forward to university officials and make the occurrence of hazing known. In their study, Richardson et al. set out to study whistle-blowing by using the theory of reasoned action as a framework to predict whether or not individuals will come forward about report hazing incidents. Their study served to examine whether the relationships suggested by the TRA model remain true in predicting whistle blowing intentions, and if these relationships would change depending on the severity of the hazing incident.

Richardson et al. surveyed a sample of 259 students from Greek organizations at university in the Southwestern United States. The survey questions measured the different aspects of the TRA model: behavioral beliefs, outcome evaluations, attitude toward the behavior, normative beliefs, motivation to comply, subjective norms, and the consequence endogenous variable. The questions asked respondents to rate their responses on various 7 point scales. "Participants in the study responded to one of three scenarios, varying in level of severity, describing a hazing situation occurring in their fraternity or sorority".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In line with the theory, the researchers wanted to identify if attitudes held about hazing, dangerous activity, and group affiliation, along with subjective norms about whistle-blowing (reactions by others, consequences of reporting the action, isolation from the group) would influence whether or not an individual would go through with reporting a hazing incident. The results of the study found that individuals were more likely to report, or whistle-blow, on hazing incidents that were more severe or harmful to individuals. Simultaneously, individuals were also concerned about the perceptions of others' attitudes towards them and the consequences they may face if they reported hazing incidents.

==== Knowledge sharing in companies ====
TRA is used to examine the communication behavior in corporations. One of the behaviors TRA helped characterize is knowledge sharing (KS) in companies. In the study conducted by Ho, Hsu, and Oh, they proposed two models to construct KS process by introducing TRA and game theory (GT). One model captures personal psychological feelings (attitudes and subjective norms), the other model not only captures personal feelings but also takes other people's decisions into consideration. By comparing the two models, researchers found that the model based on TRA has a higher predictive accuracy than the model based on TRA and GT. They concluded that employees "have a high probability of not analyzing the decisions of others",&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chien‐Ta Bruce Ho|last2=Shih‐Feng Hsu|last3=K.B. Oh|date=2009-10-30|title=Knowledge sharing: game and reasoned action perspectives|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/02635570911002289|journal=Industrial Management &amp; Data Systems|volume=109|issue=9|pages=1211–1230|doi=10.1108/02635570911002289|issn=0263-5577}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whether taking other colleague's decision into account has a great impact on people's KS behavioral intention. It is indicated that "the more indirect decision-makers there are in organizations, the less effective is KS".&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; To encourage KS, company managers should avoid including indirect decision-makers in the projects.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Consumer behavior ===

==== Coupon usage ====
Coupon usage has also been studied through the theory of reasoned action framework by researchers interested in consumer and marketer behavior. In 1984, Terence Shimp and Alican Kavas applied this theory to coupon usage behavior, with the research premise that "coupon usage is rational, systematic, and thoughtful behavior"&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Theory of Reasoned Action Applied to Coupon Usage|last = Shimp|first = Terence|date = December 1984|journal = Journal of Consumer Research|doi = 10.1086/209015|pmid = |last2 = Kavas|first2 = Alican|issue = Volume 11|volume=11|page=795}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in contrast with other applications of the theory to more dangerous types of behavior.

Theory of Reasoned Action serves as a useful model because it can help examine whether "consumers' intentions to use coupons are determined by their attitudes and perceptions of whether important others think one should or should not expend the effort to clip, save, and use coupons".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The consumer's behavior intentions are influenced by their personal beliefs about coupon usage, meaning whether or not they think saving money is important and are willing to spend the time clipping coupons. These potential beliefs also influenced the coupon user's thoughts about what others think about their usage of coupons. Together, the coupon user will use their own beliefs and the opinions of others to form an overall attitude towards coupon usage.  To approach this study, Shimp and Alican surveyed 770 households and measured the aspects of the TRA model in terms of the participant's responses. The received responses indicated that consumers' norms are "partially determined by their personal beliefs toward coupon usage, and to an even greater extend, that attitudes are influenced by internalizations of others' beliefs".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Positive attitudes towards this behavior are influenced by an individual's perceptions that their partners will be satisfied by their time spent and efforts made to save money.
[[File:Pictorial_Presentation_of_UBL.gif|thumb|3 variables in Unit Brand Loyalty (UBL)]]

==== Brand loyalty ====
TRA has been applied to redefine [[brand loyalty]]. According to the theory of reasoned action, the antecedents of purchase behaviour are attitudes towards the purchase and subjective norm. In 1998, Ha conducted a study to investigate the relationships among several antecedents of unit brand loyalty (UBL) by introducing TRA. Consumers are brand loyal when both attitude and behavior are favorable. In his study, Ha developed a table indicating 8 combinations of customers' brand loyalty based on their loyalty on 3 variables – attitude towards the behavior, subjective norm, and purchase behavior is loyal. According to Ha, marketing managers should not be discouraged by a temporary disloyalty and need to strive for grabbing brand loyalty when customers are showing loyalty to two of the three variables, but they need to rediagnose their customers' brand loyalty when customers are showing loyalty to only one of them. The main focus should be pointed at either enhancing the consumer's attitude toward their brand or adjusting their brand to the [[Norm (social)|social norms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choong Lyong Ha|date=1998-02-01|title=The theory of reasoned action applied to brand loyalty|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/10610429810209737|journal=Journal of Product &amp; Brand Management|volume=7|issue=1|pages=51–61|doi=10.1108/10610429810209737|issn=1061-0421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Green Behaviors ====
TRA has also been used to study consumer attitudes towards [[renewable energy]]. In 2000, Bang, et. al found that people who cared about environmental issues like pollution were more willing to spend more for renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bang|first=Hae-Kyong|last2=Ellinger|first2=Alexander E.|last3=Hadjimarcou|first3=John|last4=Traichal|first4=Patrick A.|date=2000-06-01|title=Consumer concern, knowledge, belief, and attitude toward renewable energy: An application of the reasoned action theory|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6793(200006)17:63.0.CO;2-8/abstract|journal=Psychology and Marketing|language=en|volume=17|issue=6|pages=449–468|doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-6793(200006)17:6&lt;449::aid-mar2&gt;3.0.co;2-8|issn=1520-6793}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a 2008 study of Swedish consumers by Hansla et. al showed that those who with a positive view of renewable energy were more willing to spend money on sustainable energy for their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hansla|first=André|last2=Gamble|first2=Amelie|last3=Juliusson|first3=Asgeir|last4=Gärling|first4=Tommy|title=Psychological determinants of attitude towards and willingness to pay for green electricity|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2007.10.027|journal=Energy Policy|volume=36|issue=2|pages=768–774|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2007.10.027|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies are evidence that the emotional response people have towards a topic affects their attitude, which in turn affects their behavioral intent. These studies also provide examples for how the TRA is used to market goods that might not make the most sense from a strictly economic perspective.

In addition, Mishara et.al 's research proved there is a positively relation between behavioral intention and actual behavior in Green Information Technology (GIT) acceptance. Those professionals with positive intentions towards GIT tend to exploit GIT into practice. &lt;ref&gt;Mishra, D., Akman, I., &amp; Mishra, A. (2014).

=== Health behavior ===

==== Condom use ====
Theory of Reasoned Action has been frequently used as a framework and predictive mechanism of applied research on sexual behavior, especially in prevention of [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted disease]] such as HIV. In 2001, Albarracín, Johnson, Fishbein, and Muellerleile applied theory of reasoned action (TRA) and [[theory of planned behavior]] (TPB) into studying how well the theories predict [[condom]] use.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Albarracín|first=Dolores|last2=Johnson|first2=Blair|last3=Fishbein|first3=Martin|last4=Muellerleile|first4=Paige|title=Theories of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior as Models of Condom Use: A Meta-Analysis|url=http://digitalcommons.uconn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&amp;context=chip_docs|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=127|issue=1|pmid=11271752|pmc=4780418|pages=142–61|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.127.1.142|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be consistent with TRA, the authors synthesized 96 data sets (N = 22,594), and associate every component in condom use with certain weight. Their study indicates that the theories of reasoned action and planned behavior are highly successful predictors of condom use. According to their discussion, "people are more likely to use condoms if they have previously formed the corresponding intentions. These intentions to use condoms appear to derive from attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. These attitudes and norms, in turn, appear to derive from outcome and normative beliefs. Nevertheless, whether behavior was assessed retrospectively or prospectively was an important moderator that influenced the magnitude of the associations between theoretically important variables."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== Sexual behavior in teenage girls ====
In 2011, W.M. Doswell, Braxter, Cha, and Kim examined sexual behavior in African American teenage girls and applied the theory as a framework for understanding this behavior. The theory of reasoned action can explain these behaviors in that teens' behavioral intentions to engage in early sexual behavior are influenced by their pre-existing attitudes and subjective norms of their peers. Attitudes in this context are favorable or unfavorable dispositions towards teenage sexual behavior.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doswell|first=Willa|last2=Braxter|first2=Betty|last3=Cha|first3=EunSeok|last4=Kim|first4=Kevin|date=2011|title=Testing the Theory of Reasoned Action in Explaining Sexual Behavior Among African American Young Teen Girls|url=|journal=Journal of Pediatric Nursing|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjective norms are the perceived social pressure teenagers feel from their friends, classmates, and other peer groups to engage in sexual behavior. As a framework, the TRA suggests that adolescents will participate in early behavior because of their own attitudes towards the behavior and the subjective norms of their peers. In this case, intention is the willful plan to perform early sexual behavior.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Findings from the student showed that the TRA was supportive in predicting early sexual behavior among African American teenage girls. Attitudes towards sex and subjective norms both correlated with intentions to participate in early sexual behavior in the study's sample.

==== Pediatricians, parents and HPV vaccinations ====
A 2011 study examining pediatricians' behaviors surrounding the [[HPV vaccines|Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine]] found that TRA predicted the pediatricians would encourage parents to get their daughters vaccinated. Roberto, Krieger, Katz, Goei, and Jain discovered that the norms surrounding this topic were more important in predicting behavior than perceived behavioral control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberto|first=Anthony J.|last2=Krieger|first2=Janice L.|last3=Katz|first3=Mira L.|last4=Goei|first4=Ryan|last5=Jain|first5=Parul|date=2011-06-01|title=Predicting Pediatricians' Communication With Parents About the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine: An Application of the Theory of Reasoned Action|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2010.550021|journal=Health Communication|volume=26|issue=4|pages=303–312|doi=10.1080/10410236.2010.550021|issn=1041-0236|pmc=4154063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Exercise ====
The public health community, interested in reducing rising obesity rates, has used TRA to study people's exercise behavior. A 1981 study by Bentler and Speckart revealed that intent to exercise was determined by a person's attitude toward exercise, as predicted by TRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bentler|first=Peter M.|last2=Speckart|first2=George|title=Attitudes "cause" behaviors: A structural equation analysis.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.40.2.226|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=40|issue=2|pages=226–238|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.40.2.226|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a broader literature review on the study of exercise using TRA and TPB, it was determined that behavioral intent to exercise is better framed by TRA than TPB because perceived behavioral control did not have a significant effect on the intent to exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blue|first=Carolyn L.|date=1995-04-01|title=The predictive capacity of the theory of reasoned action and the theory of planned behavior in exercise research: An integrated literature review|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nur.4770180205/abstract|journal=Research in Nursing &amp; Health|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=105–121|doi=10.1002/nur.4770180205|issn=1098-240X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Challenges'''

According to Fishbein's and Ajzen's original (1967) formulation of TRA, a behavioral intention measure will predict the performance of any voluntary act, unless intent changes prior to performance or unless the intention measure does not correspond to the behavioral criterion in terms of action, target, context, time-frame and/or specificity.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheppard|first=Blair H.|last2=Hartwick|first2=Jon|last3=Warshaw|first3=Paul R.|date=1988-01-01|title=The Theory of Reasoned Action: A Meta-Analysis of Past Research with Recommendations for Modifications and Future Research|jstor=2489467|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=15|issue=3|pages=325–343|doi=10.1086/209170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model of TRA has been challenged by studies determined to examine its limitation and inadequacy.

The major problem of TRA is pointed out to be the ignorance of the connections between individuals, both the interpersonal and social relations in which they act, and the broader social structures which govern social practice.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=cQ7H08_OvP8C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA253&amp;dq=critique+of+reasoned+action&amp;ots=dhCEBUWnHk&amp;sig=jNSnAn-CzvoRMQkNdUzBi0_8P10#v=onepage&amp;q=critique%20of%20reasoned%20action&amp;f=false|title=The Theory of Reasoned Action: Its Application to Aids-preventive Behavior|last=Terry|first=Deborah J.|last2=Gallois|first2=Cynthia|last3=McCamish|first3=Malcolm|date=1993-01-01|publisher=Psychology Press|year=|isbn=9780080419329|location=|pages=255|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although TRA recognizes the importance of [[Norm (social)|social norms]], strategies are limited to a consideration of individual [[Perception|perceptions]] of these social phenomena. Individual's belief, attitudes and understandings are constituted activity, therefore the distinction of the two factors is ambiguous. In 1972, Shwartz and Tessler noted that there are other major and subjective determinants of intentions at play that go beyond attitudes toward the behavior and subjective norms. Namely, they propose that one's sense of right and wrongs, as well as one's beliefs surrounding moral obligation may also impact one's intention. &lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, S. H., &amp; Tessler, R. C. (1972). A test of a model for reducing measured attitude-behavior discrepancies. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 24''(2), 225-236.

&lt;nowiki&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0033365&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; This value system is internalized independently from Fishbein and Ajzen's subjective norms. &lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Furthermore, social change may be generational rather than the sum of individual change. TRA fails to capture and oversimplifies the social processes of change and the social nature of the change itself: a model in which people collectively appropriate and construct new meanings and practice.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

Additionally, the habituation of past behavior also tends to reduce the impact that intention has on behavior as the habit increases. Gradually, the performance of the behavior become less of a rational, initiative behavior and more of a learned response. In addition, intention appears to have a direct effect on behavior in the short term only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Richard|last=Bagozzi|year=1981|title=Attitudes, intentions, and behavior: A test of some key hypotheses|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=41|pages=607–627|doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.41.4.607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, the analysis of the conceptual basis also raises concerns. It is criticized that the model does not enable the generation of hypothesis because of their ambiguity. The model focuses on analytic truth rather than synthetic one, therefore the conclusions resulting from those applications are often true by definition rather than by observation which makes the model unfalsifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogden|first=Jane|year=2003|title=Some Problems With Social Cognition Models: A Pragmatic and Conceptual Analysis|url=http://psych415.class.uic.edu/Readings/Ogden,%20Social%20Cog%20Models,%20HlthPsy,%202003.pdf|journal=Health Psychology|volume=22|issue=4|pages=424–428|via=|doi= 10.1037/0278-6133.22.4.424}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strengths of attitudes toward a behavior (social/personal) and subjective norms also vary cross-culturally while the process by which the behavior engaged remains the same. An example of this is shown in a cross-cultural study on fast food choices, where people from Western cultures were found to be more influenced by their prior choice of restaurant than people from Eastern cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BAGOZZI|first=R|last2=WONG|first2=N|last3=ABE|first3=S|last4=BERGAMI|first4=M|title=Cultural and Situational Contingencies and the Theory of Reasoned Action: Application to Fast Food Restaurant Consumption|url=https://doi.org/10.1207/S15327663JCP0902_4|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|volume=9|issue=2|pages=97–106|doi=10.1207/s15327663jcp0902_4|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would suggest that people from different cultures weight subjective norms and existing attitudes differently. A closer examination of the cross-cultural communication process will benefit and complete the understanding of theory of reasoned action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Hee Sun|year=2000|title=Relationships among attitudes and subjective norms: Testing the theory of reasoned action across cultures|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/233197325/fulltext/261DC8DF13FF4427PQ/1?accountid=11091|journal=Communication Studies|volume=|pages=162–175|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Future Directions'''

According to Jaccard James, three directions are waiting for further research in TRA. The first one is per-individual level. The second area is a split-second situations, namely, instant decision-making. The third one is multioption contexts. In other words, how people perform when facing multiple alternatives should be stressed in the future study.&lt;ref&gt;Jaccard, J. (2012). The Reasoned Action Model: Directions for Future Research. ''The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,640''(1), 58-80. &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2598">A '''time server''' is a [[server (computing)|server]] [[computer]] that reads the actual time from a [[clock signal|reference clock]] and distributes this information to its clients using a computer network. The time server may be a local network time server or an internet time server.

The most important and widely used protocol for distributing and synchronising time over the Internet is the [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP), though other less-popular or outdated time protocols continue in use. A variety of protocols are in common use for sending time signals over radio links and serial connections.

The time reference used by a time server could be another time server on the network or the Internet, a connected radio clock or an [[atomic clock]]. The most common true time source is a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] or [[Radio clock#GPS_clocks|GPS master clock]]. Time servers are sometimes multi-purpose [[network server]]s, dedicated network servers, or dedicated devices. All a dedicated time server does is provide accurate time.

An existing network server (e.g. a file server) can become a time server with additional software. The NTP homepage provides a free and widely used reference implementation of the NTP server and client for many popular [[operating system]]s.  The other choice is a dedicated time server device.

The term "stratum" is used to label the closeness to a central or high quality time server. The stratum indicates the place of a particular time server in a hierarchy of servers. The scale is 1 to 15 where 1 is the most accurate and likely a highly specialized physical hardware device. Some time clients will reject a time update from a server whose stratum is too high, and most will prefer low strata time sources to higher ones. This can be a pitfall for administrators setting up an in-house time server with no true time source.

'''Tradigital art''' is [[art]] (including [[animation]]) that combines both traditional and computer-based techniques to create an image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordspy.com/words/tradigital.asp WordSpy entry] for ''tradigital''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Image:Unique.jpg|right|thumb|Unique Editions&lt;br&gt;top, left to right: [[Bonny Lhotka]], Judith Moncrieff;&lt;br&gt;bottom, left to right: Dorothy Krause, Karin Schminke, Helen Golden]]
Artist and teacher [[Judith Moncrieff]] first coined the term. In the early 1990s, while an instructor at the [[Pacific Northwest College of Art]], Moncrieff invented and taught a new digital medium called "Tradigital". The school held a competition between Moncrieff's students, who used the medium to electronically combine everything from photographs of costumes to stills from videotapes of performing dancers.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Gragg, "Art students get a crack at 'Nutcracker'," ''Portland Oregonian'', October 25, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lisawrayart.com"&gt;Lisa Wray, [http://www.lisawrayart.com/index.htm ''Judith Montcrieff, Unique Editions and Tradigital Fine Art''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713212916/http://www.lisawrayart.com/index.htm |date=2011-07-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moncrieff also referred to her business entity (formerly "Moncrieff Studios") as "Tradigital Imaging" around the same period.

Moncrieff was one of five founding members of the digital art collective called "Unique Editions". These five artists—Helen Golden, [[Bonny Lhotka]], Dorothy Krause,&lt;ref&gt;William Zimmer, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E5DD1339F93BA25751C0A960958260 "ART;A Family and Its Gallery Click on the Future"], ''The New York Times'', February 18, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Judith Moncrieff, and Karin Schminke—combined their expertise in traditional studio media and techniques with [[digital imaging]] to produce original fine art and editions. The artists met in June, 1994, at "Beyond the Digital Print", a workshop organized by Krause at [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]] in Boston. The artists' varied backgrounds are evident in their mixed media approach to using the computer as an art-making tool. Although every image is conceived and executed at least in part on the computer, the range of work includes one of a kind paintings, collages, Polaroid and image transfers, monotypes and prints on such varied substrates as canvas, handmade paper, and embossed metal. Moncrieff used the term "Tradigital media" to describe this merging of traditional and digital tools and "tradigitalism" as a name for this emerging movement. Unique Editions also served as a research and public relations entity for exploring technologies and promoting digital art. The group forged links with hardware and software developers in an effort to provide feedback on their products from the artist's perspective. It served as a demonstration to the rest of the art world of the role of digital technologies in the artist's studio. Unique Editions became inactive in 1997; however, Golden and Moncrieff continued to work together under the name, "Tradigital Fine Art".&lt;ref name="lisawrayart.com"/&gt;

Independently in the early 1990s, artist [[Lisa Wray]] was developing the fine art style she calls "Renaissance of Metaphysical Imagery". Prototypes were made for each work from color copies, color photos or film negatives made in her graphic arts darkroom. In 1990, she visited the only two places in the country with proprietary computer systems capable of assembling her prototypes: Raphael Digital Transparencies in Houston Texas, and Dodge Color Laboratories in Washington D.C. The first two prototypes, Brew of Life and Fantasy, were assembled by Dodge Color Laboratories on a Superset machine that was first developed by the Department of Defense. The final art was archived on 1" magnetic tape, and then output as an 11x14” color film transparency. Lisa discovered Judith Montcrieff and her pioneering efforts with Unique Editions and Tradigital Fine Art, in the early 1990s, found the term, "Tradigital", and also used the term to describe her own work.&lt;ref name="lisawrayart.com"/&gt;

==Other uses of the term==
Since then, use of the term has greatly expanded to include other art forms.

In 2002, "tradigital" went mainstream when [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] used the term '''tradigital animation''' to refer to the blending of computer animation with classical [[cell animation]] techniques, "a seamless blend of two-dimensional and three-dimensional animation techniques".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Doherty, [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&amp;p_theme=bg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=106FA0A1A27D07B8&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM "Sense and Cinematography"], ''The Boston Globe'', Dec 12, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned as examples such animation films as ''[[Toy Story]]'', ''[[Antz]]'', ''[[Shrek]]'', ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'', and ''[[Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Kehr, [http://movies.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?res=9A04E6DE1F38F937A15756C0A9649C8B63 "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"], ''The New York Times'', May 24, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Canemaker, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E0DC1430F931A25756C0A9649C8B63 "SUMMER MOVIES; Flat Worlders Face the Horizon and See It's in 3-D"], ''The New York Times'', May 12, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Horwitz, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A2169-2002May23 Stallion vs. Iron Horse: A Galloping Good Tale], ''The Washington Post'', May 24, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todd Leopold, [http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/22/ca.s02.spirit.katzenberg/index.html "The 'Spirit' of a movie mogul"], ''CNN'', May 22, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nina Rehfeld, [https://www.welt.de/print-wams/article104216/Die_Zukunft_der_Maerchen.html "Die Zukunft der Märchen"], ''Die Welt'', Dec. 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Moore, "The 'Spirit' of Jeffrey Katzenberg," ''The Orlando Sentinel'', May 24, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that [[Walt Disney]] (a [[traditional art]] animator) would approve of the changes in the way cartoons are made today. Animation World Magazine&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Edwards, [http://www.awn.com/mag/issue6.01/6.01pages/edwardstelevision.php3 "Tradigital Television: Digital Tools and Saturday Morning"], ''Animation World Magazine'', Issue 6.01, April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; describes '''tradigital television''', and the impact of tradigital animation on pre- and post-production processes for television shows.

'''Tradigital printing''' is an experimental approach to [[printmaking]] with contemporary technology. In one form of tradigital printing, printmakers use computers to generate positives for UV photo transfer to plates and screens. In another form, digital print output incorporating [[silkscreen]], relief or [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] techniques is the focus. For example, the Josephine Press&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Press, [http://www.josephinepress.com/tradigital.html ''Tradigital Printmaking''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630045035/http://www.josephinepress.com/tradigital.html |date=2008-06-30 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; uses a process that combines the use of archival digital prints with traditional techniques such as intaglio, [[woodcut]]s, [[lithograph]]s, and all of the other traditional printmaking methods. The process allows the artist to create a multi-color image without using a four-plate process. In addition to more efficient registration, the artist can work with collage and other mixed media works that can be scanned and reproduced in an archival manner. Tradigital printing greatly expands the possibilities of image-making while still producing an original hand pulled, limited edition, fine art print.

A recent Wall Street Journal article hailed '''tradigital creatives''' as the "voice of tomorrow",&lt;ref&gt;Manish Sinha, [http://www.livemint.com/2008/08/14151616/Web-Exclusive--Creativity-in.html "Creativity in tradigital times"], The Wall Street Journal, Aug 14 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; contrasting them with both "traditionalists" and "digitalists", and identifying several distinguishing characteristics of the new art/marketing medium: voices not eyeballs; experience not messages; community not communication; utility and solutions not cleverness; collaborative not silo thinkers.

The '''use of force''', in the context of [[law enforcement]], may be defined as the "amount of effort required by police to compel compliance by an unwilling subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Police Use of Force |url=http://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/officer-safety/use-of-force/pages/welcome.aspx |website=National Institute of Justice |publisher=Office of Justice Programs |accessdate=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Use of force doctrines''' can be employed by [[law enforcement officers]] and [[military personnel]] on guard duty. The aim of such doctrines is to balance the needs of security with [[Ethics|ethical]] concerns for the [[rights]] and well-being of intruders or suspects. Injuries to [[civilians]] tend to focus attention on [[Self-defense (theory)|self-defense]] as a [[Excuse (legal)|justification]] and, in the event of death, the notion of [[justifiable homicide]].

[[U.S. military|U.S. military personnel]] on guard duty are given a "use of force briefing" by the sergeant of the guard before being assigned to their post.

For the [[English law]] on the use of force in crime prevention, see [[Self-defence in English law]]. The [[Australia]]n position on the use of troops for civil policing is set out by [[Michael Hood]] in ''Calling Out the Troops: Disturbing Trends and Unanswered Questions'';&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UNSWLJ/2005/33.html&lt;/ref&gt; compare "Use of Deadly Force by the South African Police Services Re-visited"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crisa.org.za/section_49.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218065028/http://www.crisa.org.za/section_49.pdf |archivedate=February 18, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Malebo Keebine-Sibanda]] and [[Omphemetse Sibanda]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==History==
Use of force dates back to the beginning of established [[law enforcement]], with a fear that officers would abuse their power.  In today's society this fear still exists and one of the ways to fix this problem is to require police to wear body cameras and to have them turned on during all interactions with civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alpert|first1=Geoffrey P.|last2=Dunham|first2=Roger G.|title=Understanding Police Use of Force: Officers, Suspects, and Reciprocity|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|page=17|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of force continuum==
{{main|Use of force continuum}}

The use of force may be standardized by a [[use of force continuum]], which presents guidelines as to the degree of force appropriate in a given situation. One source identifies five very generalized steps, increasing from least use of force to greatest. It is only one side of the model, as it does not give the levels of subject resistance that merit the corresponding increases in force.[http://www.policeone.com/writers/columnists/marksman/articles/123080/] Each successive level of force is meant to describe an escalating series of actions an officer may take to resolve a situation, and the level of force used rises only when a lower level of force would be ineffective in dealing with the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Use-of-Force Continuum | url=http://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/officer-safety/use-of-force/continuum.htm | date=August 4, 2009 |publisher=National Institute of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Typically any style of a use of force continuum will start with officer presence, and end with the use of deadly force.

#Presence (using the effect of the presence of an authority figure on a subject)
#Verbalization (commanding a subject)
#Empty hand control (using empty hands to search, relieve weapons, immobilize, or otherwise control a subject)
#Intermediate weapons (using non-lethal chemical, electronic or impact weapons on a subject)
#Deadly Force (using any force likely to cause permanent injury or death to a subject)

Use of force continuums can be further broken down.

===''[[Graham v. Connor]]'' (1989)===
On November 12, 1984 Graham, who was a diabetic, felt an insulin reaction coming on and rushed to the store with a friend to get some orange juice. When the store was too crowded, he and his friend proceeded to go to another friend's house. In the midst of all this, he was being watched by Officer Connor, of the [[Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department|Charlotte City Police Department]] police department. While on their way to the friend's house, the officer stopped the two of them and called for backup. After several other officers arrived, one of them [[handcuffs|handcuffed]] Graham. Eventually, when Connor learned that nothing had happened in the convenience store, the officers drove Graham home and released him. Over the course of the encounter, Graham sustained a broken foot, cuts on his wrists, a bruised forehead and an injured shoulder. The Supreme Court held that it was irrelevant whether Connor acted in good faith, because the use of force must be judged based on its objective reasonableness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graham vs. Connor |url=http://law.uark.edu/documents/Bailey-CrimPro-Graham-v.-Connor.pdf |accessdate=August 4, 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021064117/http://law.uark.edu/documents/Bailey-CrimPro-Graham-v.-Connor.pdf |archivedate=October 21, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''[[Tennessee v. Garner]]'' (1985)===
On October 3, 1974, Officers Elton Hymon and Leslie Wright of the [[Memphis Police Department]] were called to respond to a possible burglary. When they arrived to the scene, a woman standing on the porch began to tell them that she heard glass breaking and that she believed the house next door was being broken into. Officer Hymon went to check, where he saw Edward Garner, who was fleeing the scene. As Garner was climbing over the gate, Hymon called out "police, halt", and when Garner failed to do so, Hymon fatally shot Garner in the back of the head, despite being "reasonably sure" that Garner was unarmed. The Supreme Court held deadly force may be used to prevent the escape of a fleeing felon only if the officer has [[probable cause]] to believe that the suspect poses a serious risk to the officer or to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tennessee v. Garner|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/471/1.html|accessdate=August 12, 2015|quote="[Deadly] force may not be used unless necessary to prevent the escape [of a fleeing suspect] and the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Nelson v. City of Davis'' (2004)===
On April 16, 2004, what was supposed to be known as the "biggest party in history" took place at the annual [[UC Davis]] picnic. Due to the large number of participants at this party, people began to illegally park their cars. Sgt. John Wilson demanded that officers start to issue parking tickets to the illegally parked cars. Tickets were also issued to the underage drinkers. Wilson called the owner of the apartment complex because of the disturbances that were being caused; loud music and the sounds of bottles breaking. Wilson was consented by the complex apartment owner to have non-residents to leave the complex. 30 to 40 officers were rounded up with riot gear - including pepper ball guns - to try to disperse the crowd of 1,000 attendees. The officers gathered in front of the complex where 15 to 20 students, including Timothy C. Nelson, were attempting to leave, but no instructions police were given by the police. Officers began to fire [[Pepper-spray projectile|pepper-balls]], one of which struck Nelson in the eye. He collapsed immediately and was taken to the hospital much later on, where he suffered multiple injuries including temporary blindness and a permanent loss of visual acuity. He endured multiple surgeries to try to repair the injury. Nelson lost his athletic scholarship due to his injury and was forced to withdraw from UC Davis. The officers were unable to find any criminal charges against Nelson. The Ninth Circuit held that the use of force was unreasonable and the officers were not entitled to [[qualified immunity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nelson v. City of Davis|url=http://www.willamette.edu/wucl/resources/journals/wlo/9thcir/2012/07/nelson-v-city-of-davis.html|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Plumhoff v. Rickard'' (2014) ===
On July 18, 2014, a West Memphis police officer stopped Donald Rickard for a broken headlight. As the officer talked with Rickard he noticed that there was an indentation in the [[windshield]] and that Rickard was acting very erratic. The officer asked Rickard to step out of the vehicle. Rickard at that point fled the scene. A high speed chase ensued, which involved several other officers. Rickard lost control of his vehicle in a parking lot, and officers exited their vehicles to approach Rickard. Rickard again tried to flee, hitting several police cruisers and nearly hitting several officers. At this time officers opened fire on Rickard. The officers fired a total of 15 rounds which resulted in the death of both Rickard and his passenger. The Supreme Court ruled that the use of force was justified, because the objective reasonableness of the use of deadly force must be based on the situation in which it was used, and not on hindsight.&lt;ref&gt;''Plumhoff v. Rickard'', 134 S. Ct. 2012, 572 U.S., 188 L. Ed. 2d 1056 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. statistics ==
Of the 40 million people in the [[United States]] who had face to face contact with the police 1.4%, or 574,000, reported use of force or the threat of use of force being directed at them. About a quarter of the 574,000 incidents involved the police officer pointing the gun at the subject of the incident and 53.5% of the incidents saw the officer using physical force such as kicking, grabbing, and pushing. In addition, 13.7% of those that had force used against them or were threatened with the use of force submitted complaints to the offending officer's department. Of those that received use of force from a police officer or were threatened with use of force almost 75% reported that they believed it was excessive and unwarranted. This statistic was consistent across the Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic races.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Justice. (2011). ''Contacts Between Police and the Public, 2008. ''(NCJ 234599). Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by the ''Washington Post'' found that 385 Americans were fatally shot by law enforcement officers in the first five months of 2015, an average of more than two fatal shootings a day, which was more than twice the rate reported in official statistics. 221 of those killed were armed with guns, and 68 were armed with knives or other blades..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/fatal-police-shootings-in-2015-approaching-400-nationwide/2015/05/30/d322256a-058e-11e5-a428-c984eb077d4e_story.html?hpid=z1| author=Kimberly Kindy| title=Fatal police shootings in 2015 approaching 400 nationwide| publisher=The Washington Post| date=May 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Officer attributes==
===Education===

Studies have shown that law enforcement personnel with some college education (typically two-year degrees) use force much less often than those with little to no higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Galvan|first1=Astrid|title=Study: Educated Cops Less Likely To Use Force|url=http://www.abqjournal.com/news/metro/3023320metro11-30-10.htm|accessdate=October 10, 2014|work=Albuquerque Journal|date=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In events that the educated officers do use force, it is usually what is considered "reasonable" force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Worden|first1=Robert E.|title=And Justice for All: Understanding and Controlling Police Abuse of Force|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|pages=23–51|accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these findings, very little - only 1% - of police forces within the United States have education requirements for those looking to join their forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rydberg|first1=Jason|last2=Terrill|first2=William|title=The Effect of Higher Education on Police Behavior|journal=Police Quarterly|year=2010|volume=13|issue=1|pages=92–120|url=http://pqx.sagepub.com/content/13/1/92.full.pdf+html|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that police work deeply requires experience that can only be gained from actually working in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paoline III|first1=Eugene A.|last2=Terrill|first2=William|title=Police Education, Experience, and the Use of Force|journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior|date=February 2007|volume=34|issue=2|page=182|url=http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/34/2/179.full.pdf+html|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experience===
It is argued that the skills for performing law enforcement tasks well cannot be produced from a classroom setting. These skills tend to be better gained through repeated exposure to law enforcement situations while in the line of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Terrill|first1=William|title=Police Education, Experience, and the Use of Force|journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior|date=February 2007|volume=34|issue=2|page=182|url=http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/34/2/179.full.pdf+html|accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results as to whether or not the amount of experience an officer has contributes to the likelihood that they will use force differ among studies.

=== Other characteristics ===
It has not been strongly found that the race, class, gender, age etc. of an officer affects the likelihood that they will use force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Travis|first1=Jeremy|last2=Chaiken|first2=Jan|last3=Kaminski|first3=Robert|title=Use of Force by Police|journal=National Institute of Justice|date=October 1999|page=9|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/176330-1.pdf|accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situational factors may come into play.

==== Split-second syndrome====
Split-second syndrome is an example of how use of force can be situation-based. Well-meaning officers may resort to the use of force too quickly under situations where they must make a rapid decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunham|first1=Roger G.|last2=Alpert|first2=Geoffrey P.|title=Critical Issues in Policing|date=2010|publisher=Waveland Press, Inc.|location=Long Grove, IL|pages=466|edition=6|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Departmental attributes==
Policies on use of force can differ between departments. The type of policies established and whether or not they are enforced can affect an officer's likeliness to use force. If policies are established, but not enforced heavily by the department, the policies may not make a difference. For example, the [[Rodney King]] case was described as a problem with the departmental supervision not being clear on policies of (excessive) force.

One departmental level policy that is currently being studied and called for by many citizens and politicians is the use of body cameras by officers. In one study body cameras were shown to reduce the use of force by as much as 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Effect of Police Body-Worn Cameras on Use of Force and Citizens’ Complaints Against the Police: A Randomized Controlled Trial|author1=Barak Ariel |author2=William A.

== Crime levels ==
At the micro level, violent crime levels in the neighborhood increase the likelihood of law enforcement use of force. In contrast, at the meso level violent neighborhood crime does not have that much effect on use of force.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, H., Vaughn, M. S., &amp; Lim, H. (2014).

==England and Wales==
In England and Wales the use of (reasonable) force is provided to [[police]] and any other [[person]] from Section 3 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]], which states:

"A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at large".

Use of force may be considered lawful if it was, on the basis of the facts as the accused honestly believed them,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/self_defence/#Reasonable_Force CPS: Self-Defence and the Prevention of Crime]&lt;/ref&gt; necessary and reasonable.

(Further provision about when force is "reasonable" was made by [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2008/ukpga_20080004_en_9#pt5-pb5-l1g76 section 76] of the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]].)

The '''''Visha Kanya''''' ([[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa| विष कन्या}}; {{lang-en|Poison girl}}) were young women reportedly used as [[assassins]], often against powerful enemies, during the times of the [[Ancient India]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jpXijlqeRpIC|title=India's Historic Battles: From Alexander the Great to Kargil|last=Roy|first=Kaushik|date=2004-01-01|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=9788178241098|page=24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their blood and bodily fluids were purportedly poisonous to other humans, as was mentioned in the ancient Indian treatise on [[public policy|statecraft]], ''[[Arthashastra]]'', written by [[Chanakya]], an adviser and a prime minister to the first Maurya Emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]] (c. 340–293 BCE).&lt;ref name="Chaurasia2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Radhey Shyam Chaurasia|title=History of ancient India: earliest times to 1000 A.D.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cWmsQQ2smXIC&amp;pg=PA100|accessdate=20 June 2011|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist|isbn=978-81-269-0027-5|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
A [[Hindu mythology]] text, the ''[[Kalki Purana]]'', mentions that they can kill a person just by looking at them, and talks about a Visha Kanya named Sulochana, the wife of a [[Gandharva]], Chitragreeva.&lt;ref name="Chaturvedi2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=B.K.

However, in time, "poison damsel" passed into [[folklore]], became an [[archetype]] explored by many writers, resulting in a popular [[literary character]] that appears in many works, including classical [[Sanskrit]] texts such as ''[[Sukasaptati]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Erotic Indian tales from the Sanskrit classic Suksaptati'', by G.L. Mathur. Hind Pocket Books, 1971. ''Page 26–27''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Poison Damsel (Sanskrit Viṣakanyā) is a literary figure that appears in Sanskrit literature as a type of assassin used by kings to destroy enemies. The story goes that young girls were raised on a carefully crafted diet of [[poison]] and antidote from a very young age, a practice referred to as [[mithridatism]]. Although many would not survive, those that did were immune to other poisons and their [[body fluid]]s would be poisonous to others; sexual contact would thus be lethal to other humans. There also exists a myth that says a Visha Kanya can cause instant death with just a touch.

According to Kaushik Roy, Visha Kanyas would kill their targets by seducing them and giving them poisoned alcohol.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some Sanskrit sources narrate that a ''Visha Kanya'' was sent by [[Mahapadma Nanda|Nanda]]'s minister Amatyarakshasa to kill [[Chandragupta Maurya]] and Chanakya diverted them to kill Parvatak.&lt;ref name="PenzerBhatta1980"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Norman Mosley Penzer|author2=Somadeva Bhatta|title=Poison-damsels: Folklore of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWEhbry3WBUC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=20 June 2011|date=November 1980|publisher=Ayer Publishing|isbn=978-0-405-13336-7|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thakur1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Molu Ram Thakur|title=Myths, rituals, and beliefs in Himachal Pradesh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JH-gI4ncuZ4C&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=20 June 2011|year=1997|publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=978-81-7387-071-2|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary treatments of the theme ==

''Visha Kanya'' has been a popular theme in [[Indian literature]] and [[folklore]], and apart from appearing in classical [[Sanskrit]] texts, it has appeared repeatedly in various works like ''Vishkanya'' by [[Shivani]] and ''Ek Aur Vish Kanya?'' by Om Prakash Sharma, who use ''Visha Kanya'' as an [[archetype]] in their stories—a beautiful girl who kills when she comes too close. More recently, the archetype has taken a new hue in the HIV/AIDS era, for example in ''Vishkanya'', a 2007 novel, based on the [[AIDS]] epidemic in society. ''Vishakanya''s have also been depicted as important characters in the book ''[[Chanakya's Chant]]''. In 2009, Vibha Rahi, a lower caste woman has written an autobiography 'Vishkanya: Untold Secrets' in Marathi, in which she portrays how upper caste women make intimate relationships with lower caste people of high profile and destroy their families and social relationships.&lt;ref name="Vibha Rahi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rahi|first=Vibha|title=Vishkanya: Untold Secrets|year=2009|publisher=Karuvaki Prakashan|location=Pune}}&lt;/ref&gt;        
 
Over the years, many Hindi films have been made on the subject. The first film, ''Visha Kanya'', was made in 1943, starring [[Leela Mishra]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0376308/ Vish Kanya (1943)] [[IMDB]].&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently, [[Vishkanya (1991)|''Vishkanya'' (1991)]], starring [[Pooja Bedi]] in the lead role.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318812/ Vishkanya (1991)] [[IMDB]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vishkanya Ek Anokhi Prem Kahani]] is a [[soap opera]] TV series which aired on [[Zee TV]]; it starred [[Aishwarya Khare]] as Aparajita Ghosh, a Visha Kanya, in the main role.

In ''The Real Life of Sebastian Knight'' the author Nabokov treats his affair with Irina Guadanini through allusions to the myth of the poison damsel. In the 2015 novel, ''The Entropy of Bones'' by [[Ayize Jama-Everett]], the main character fights a group of ''Visha Kanya''.  The trope also appears in a set of Nathaniel Hawthorne's stories.

'''Wave–particle duality''' is the concept in [[quantum mechanics]]  that every [[particle]] or [[quantum]] entity may be partly described in terms not only of particles, but also of [[wave]]s. It expresses the inability of the [[classical physics|classical]] concepts "particle" or "wave" to fully describe the behavior of [[quantum-scale]] objects. As [[Albert Einstein]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Harrison | first = David | title = Complementarity and the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics | work = UPSCALE | publisher = Dept. of Physics, U. of Toronto | year = 2002  | url = http://www.upscale.utoronto.ca/GeneralInterest/Harrison/Complementarity/CompCopen.html | accessdate = 2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|It seems as though we must use sometimes the one theory and sometimes the other, while at times we may use either. We are faced with a new kind of difficulty. We have two contradictory pictures of reality; separately neither of them fully explains the phenomena of light, but together they do.}}

Through the work of [[Max Planck]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Louis de Broglie]], [[Arthur Compton]], [[Niels Bohr]] and many others, current scientific theory holds that all particles exhibit a wave nature and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Quantum Mechanics: An Introduction | author = Walter Greiner | publisher = Springer | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-3-540-67458-0 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=7qCMUfwoQcAC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=wave-particle+all-particles }}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon has been verified not only for elementary particles, but also for compound particles like atoms and even molecules. For [[macroscopic]] particles, because of their extremely short wavelengths, wave properties usually cannot be detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei, and Particles|author1=R.

For ordinary macroscopic particles the mass is so large that the momentum is always sufficiently large to make the de Broglie wavelength small enough to be beyond the range of experimental detection, and classical mechanics reigns supreme.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the use of the wave-particle duality has worked well in physics, the meaning or interpretation has not been satisfactorily resolved; see [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]].

Bohr regarded the "duality [[paradox]]" as a fundamental or metaphysical fact of nature. A given kind of quantum object will exhibit sometimes wave, sometimes particle, character, in respectively different physical settings. He saw such duality as one aspect of the concept of [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]].&lt;ref name=Kumar2011&gt;{{cite book | last =Kumar | first =Manjit | title =Quantum: Einstein, Bohr, and the Great Debate about the Nature of Reality | publisher =W. W. Norton &amp; Company | edition =Reprint | year =2011 | pages =242, 375–376 | isbn =978-0393339888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bohr regarded renunciation of the cause-effect relation, or complementarity, of the space-time picture, as essential to the quantum mechanical account.&lt;ref&gt;[[Niels Bohr|Bohr, N.]] (1927/1928).

[[Werner Heisenberg]] considered the question further. He saw the duality as present for all quantic entities, but not quite in the usual quantum mechanical account considered by Bohr. He saw it in what is called [[second quantization]], which generates an entirely new concept of fields which exist in ordinary space-time, causality still being visualizable. Classical field values (e.g. the electric and magnetic field strengths of [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]) are replaced by an entirely new kind of field value, as considered in [[quantum field theory]]. Turning the reasoning around, ordinary quantum mechanics can be deduced as a specialized consequence of quantum field theory.&lt;ref&gt;Camilleri, K. (2009).

==History of wave-particle duality==

[[Democritus]],the original atomist,argued that all things in the universe, including light, are composed of indivisible sub-components (light being some form of solar atom).&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Page Stites, M.A./M.S. "Light I: Particle or Wave?," Visionlearning Vol. PHY-1 (3), 2005.
http://www.visionlearning.com/library/module_viewer.php?mid=132&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 11th Century, the Arabic scientist [[Ibn al-Haytham]] wrote the first comprehensive ''[[Book of optics]]'' describing refraction, reflection, and the operation of a pinhole lens via rays of light traveling from the point of emission to the eye. He asserted that these rays were composed of particles of light. In 1630, [[René Descartes]] popularized and accredited the opposing wave description in his treatise on light, ''[[The World (Descartes)]]'', showing that the behavior of light could be re-created by modeling wave-like disturbances in a universal medium i.e. [[luminiferous aether]]. Beginning in 1670 and progressing over three decades, [[Isaac Newton]] developed and championed his [[corpuscular theory]], arguing that the perfectly straight lines of [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] demonstrated light's particle nature; only particles could travel in such straight lines. He explained [[refraction]] by positing that particles of light accelerated laterally upon entering a denser medium. Around the same time, Newton's contemporaries [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Christiaan Huygens]]—and later [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] mathematically refined the wave viewpoint, showing that if light traveled at different speeds in different media (such as water and air), [[refraction]] could be easily explained as the medium-dependent propagation of light waves. The resulting [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]] was extremely successful at reproducing light's behavior and was subsequently supported by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]'s 1801 discovery of interference by his [[double-slit experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Young| first=Thomas| title=Bakerian Lecture:  Experiments and calculations relative to physical optics|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|year=1804|volume=94|pages = 1–16 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7AZGAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|bibcode = 1804RSPT...94....1Y| doi=10.1098/rstl.1804.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/youngdoubleslit.html Thomas Young: The Double Slit Experiment]&lt;/ref&gt; The wave view did not immediately displace the ray and particle view, but began to dominate scientific thinking about light in the mid 19th century, since it could explain polarization phenomena that the alternatives could not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Buchwald | first=Jed | year=1989 | publication-date=1989 | title=The Rise of the Wave Theory of Light: Optical Theory and Experiment in the Early Nineteenth Century | edition= | place= | location=Chicago | publisher=University of Chicago Press | isbn=978-0-226-07886-1 | oclc=18069573  | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Clerk Maxwell]] discovered that he could apply his previously discovered [[Maxwell's equations]], along with a slight modification to describe self-propagating waves of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. It quickly became apparent that visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared light were all electromagnetic waves of differing frequency. The wave theory had prevailed or at least it seemed to. While the 19th century had seen the success of the wave theory at describing light, it had also witnessed the rise of the [[atomic theory]] at describing matter.

At the close of the 19th century, the reductionism of atomic theory began to advance into the atom itself determining, through physics, the nature of the atom and the operation of chemical reactions. Electricity, first thought to be a fluid, was now understood to consist of particles called [[electron]]s. This was first demonstrated by [[J. J. Thomson]] in 1897 when, using a [[cathode ray tube]], he found that an electrical charge would travel across a vacuum. Since the vacuum offered no medium for an electric fluid to travel, this discovery could only be explained via a particle carrying a negative charge and moving through the vacuum. This electron flew in the face of classical electrodynamics, which had successfully treated electricity as a fluid for many years (leading to the invention of [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[electric motor]]s, [[dynamo]]s, and [[arc lamp]]s). More importantly, the intimate relation between electric charge and electromagnetism had been well documented following the discoveries of [[Michael Faraday]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]]. Since electromagnetism was known to be a wave generated by a changing electric or magnetic field (a continuous, wave-like entity itself) an atomic/particle description of electricity and charge was a [[non sequitur (logic)|non sequitur]]. Furthermore, classical electrodynamics was not the only classical theory rendered incomplete.

===Black Body Radiation and Planck's law===
{{main|Black Body Radiation}}
In 1901, [[Max Planck]] published an analysis that succeeded in reproducing the observed [[spectrum]] of light emitted by a glowing object. To accomplish this, Planck had to make an ad hoc mathematical assumption of quantized energy of the oscillators (atoms of the [[black body]]) that emit radiation. Einstein later proposed that electromagnetic radiation itself is quantized, not the energy of radiating atoms.

[[Black-body radiation]], the emission of electromagnetic energy due to an object's heat, could not be explained from classical arguments alone. The [[equipartition theorem]] of classical mechanics, the basis of all classical thermodynamic theories, stated that an object's energy is partitioned equally among the object's vibrational [[Normal mode|modes]]. But applying the same reasoning to the electromagnetic emission of such a thermal object was not so successful. That thermal objects emit light had been long known. Since light was known to be waves of electromagnetism, physicists hoped to describe this emission via classical laws. This became known as the [[black body]] problem. Since the equipartition theorem worked so well in describing the vibrational modes of the thermal object itself, it was natural to assume that it would perform equally well in describing the radiative emission of such objects. But a problem quickly arose if each mode received an equal partition of energy, the short wavelength modes would consume all the energy. This became clear when plotting the [[Rayleigh–Jeans law]] which, while correctly predicting the intensity of long wavelength emissions, predicted infinite total energy as the intensity diverges to infinity for short wavelengths. This became known as the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]].

In 1900, [[Max Planck]] hypothesized that the frequency of light emitted by the black body depended on the frequency of the oscillator that emitted it, and the energy of these oscillators increased linearly with frequency (according E = hν where h is Planck's constant). This was not an unsound proposal considering that macroscopic oscillators operate similarly when studying five [[simple harmonic oscillator]]s of equal amplitude but different frequency, the oscillator with the highest frequency possesses the highest energy (though this relationship is not linear like Planck's). By demanding that high-frequency light must be emitted by an oscillator of equal frequency, and further requiring that this oscillator occupy higher energy than one of a lesser frequency, Planck avoided any catastrophe; giving an equal partition to high-frequency oscillators produced successively fewer oscillators and less emitted light. And as in the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]], the low-frequency, low-energy oscillators were suppressed by the onslaught of thermal jiggling from higher energy oscillators, which necessarily increased their energy and frequency.

The most revolutionary aspect of Planck's treatment of the black body is that it inherently relies on an integer number of oscillators in [[thermal equilibrium]] with the electromagnetic field. These oscillators ''give'' their entire energy to the electromagnetic field, creating a quantum of light, as often as they are ''excited'' by the electromagnetic field, absorbing a quantum of light and beginning to oscillate at the corresponding frequency. Planck had intentionally created an atomic theory of the black body, but had unintentionally generated an atomic theory of light, where the black body never generates quanta of light at a given frequency with an energy less than '''hν'''. However, once realizing that he had quantized the electromagnetic field, he denounced particles of light as a limitation of his approximation, not a property of reality.

===Photoelectric effect===
{{Main|Photoelectric effect}}

[[File:Photoelectric effect.svg|290 px|'290'px|The photoelectric effect.Incoming photons on the left strike a metal plate (bottom), and eject electrons, depicted as flying off to the right.]]

While Planck had solved the ultraviolet catastrophe by using atoms and a quantized electromagnetic field, most contemporary physicists agreed that Planck's "light quanta" represented only flaws in his model. A more-complete derivation of black body radiation would yield a fully continuous and 'wave-like' electromagnetic field with no quantization. However, in 1905 [[Albert Einstein]] took Planck's black body model to produce his solution to another outstanding problem of the day: the [[photoelectric effect]], wherein electrons are emitted from atoms when they absorb energy from light. Since their existence was theorized eight years previously, phenomenon had been studied with the electron model in mind in physics laboratories worldwide.

In 1902 [[Philipp Lenard]] discovered that the energy of these ejected electrons did ''not'' depend on the intensity of the incoming light, but instead on its ''frequency''. So if one shines a little low-frequency light upon a metal, a few low energy electrons are ejected. If one now shines a very intense beam of low-frequency light upon the same metal, a whole slew of electrons are ejected; however they possess the same low energy, there are merely ''more of them''.  The more light there is, the more electrons are ejected. Whereas in order to get high energy electrons, one must illuminate the metal with high-frequency light. Like blackbody radiation, this was at odds with a theory invoking continuous transfer of energy between radiation and matter. However, it can still be explained using a fully classical description of light, as long as matter is quantum mechanical in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first = Willis E.|last = Lamb|author-link = Willis Lamb|last2 = Scully|first2 = Marlan O.|title = The photoelectric effect without photons|url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19680009569_1968009569.pdf|year = 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one used Planck's energy quanta, and demanded that electromagnetic radiation at a given frequency could only transfer energy to matter in integer multiples of an energy quantum '''hν''', then the photoelectric effect could be explained very simply. Low-frequency light only ejects low-energy electrons because each electron is excited by the absorption of a single photon. Increasing the intensity of the low-frequency light (increasing the number of photons) only increases the number of excited electrons, not their energy, because the energy of each photon remains low. Only by increasing the frequency of the light, and thus increasing the energy of the photons, can one eject electrons with higher energy. Thus, using Planck's constant ''h'' to determine the energy of the photons based upon their frequency, the energy of ejected electrons should also increase linearly with frequency; the gradient of the line being Planck's constant. These results were not confirmed until 1915, when [[Robert Andrews Millikan]], who had previously determined the charge of the electron, produced experimental results in perfect accord with Einstein's predictions. In fact, Millikan experimented for full ten years from 1906-1916 aimed at disproving Einstein's photoelectric equation.However the value of Planck's constant determined from his experiments came out to be very close to the original value. Thus, the he established the validity of Einstein's photoelectric equation instead of disproving it. 

While energy of ejected electrons reflected Planck's constant, the existence of photons was not explicitly proven until the discovery of the [[photon antibunching]] effect, of which a modern experiment can be performed in undergraduate-level labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1119/1.1737397 | volume=72 | issue=9 | title=Observing the quantum behavior of light in an undergraduate laboratory | journal=American Journal of Physics | pages=1210|bibcode = 2004AmJPh..72.1210T | last1=Thorn | first1=J.

When Einstein received his [[Nobel Prize]] in 1921, it was not for his more difficult and mathematically laborious [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], but for the simple, yet totally revolutionary, suggestion of quantized light. Einstein's "light quanta" would not be called [[photon]]s until 1925, but even in 1905 they represented the quintessential example of wave-particle duality. Electromagnetic radiation propagates following linear wave equations, but can only be emitted or absorbed as discrete elements, thus acting as a wave and a particle simultaneously.

====Einstein's explanation of photoelectric effect using the concept of photons====

In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] provided an explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]], a hitherto troubling experiment that the wave theory of light seemed incapable of explaining. He did so by postulating the existence of [[photon]]s, [[quantum|quanta]] of light energy with particulate qualities.

In the [[photoelectric effect]], it was observed that shining a light on certain metals would lead to an [[electric current]] in a [[electrical network|circuit]]. Presumably, the light was knocking electrons out of the metal, causing current to flow. However, using the case of potassium as an example, it was also observed that while a dim blue light was enough to cause a current, even the strongest, brightest red light available with the technology of the time caused no current at all. According to the classical theory of light and matter, the strength or [[amplitude]] of a light wave was in proportion to its brightness: a bright light should have been easily strong enough to create a large current. Yet, oddly, this was not so.

Einstein explained this enigma by [[axiom|postulating]] that the electrons can receive energy from electromagnetic field only in discrete portions (quanta that were called [[photon]]s): an amount of [[energy]] ''E'' that was related to the [[frequency]] ''f'' of the light by

:&lt;math&gt;E = h f\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]] (6.626 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt; J seconds). Only photons of a high enough frequency (above a certain ''threshold'' value) could knock an electron free. For example, photons of blue light had sufficient energy to free an electron from the metal, but photons of red light did not. One photon of light above the threshold frequency could release only one electron; the higher the frequency of a photon, the higher the kinetic energy of the emitted electron, but no amount of light (using technology available at the time) below the threshold frequency could release an electron. To "violate" this law would require extremely high-intensity lasers which had not yet been invented. Intensity-dependent phenomena have now been studied in detail with such lasers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0375-9601(96)00259-9|title=Intensity dependence of the photoelectric effect induced by a circularly polarized laser beam|year=1996|last1=Zhang|first1=Q|journal=Physics Letters A|volume=216|issue=1–5|pages=125–128|bibcode = 1996PhLA..216..125Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1921 for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.

===de Broglie's hypothesis of wave-particle duality===
{{Main|Matter wave}}

[[File:Propagation of a de broglie wave.svg|290px|"290px"|right|thumb|Propagation of [[matter wave|de Broglie waves]] in 1d—real part of the [[complex number|complex]] amplitude is blue, imaginary part is green. The probability (shown as the colour [[opacity (optics)|opacity]]) of finding the particle at a given point ''x'' is spread out like a waveform; there is no definite position of the particle. As the amplitude increases above zero the [[curvature]] decreases, so the amplitude decreases again, and vice versa—the result is an alternating amplitude: a wave. Top: [[Plane wave]]. Bottom: [[Wave packet]].]]

In 1924, [[Louis-Victor de Broglie]] formulated the [[Matter wave|de Broglie hypothesis]], claiming that ''all'' matter,&lt;ref&gt;Donald H Menzel, "''Fundamental formulas of Physics''", volume 1, page 153; Gives the de Broglie wavelengths for composite particles such as protons and neutrons.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Greene]], [[The Elegant Universe]], page 104 "all matter has a wave-like character"&lt;/ref&gt; not just light, has a wave-like nature; he related [[wavelength]] (denoted as ''[[λ]]''), and [[momentum]] (denoted as ''p''):

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{h}{p}&lt;/math&gt;

This is a generalization of Einstein's equation above, since the momentum of a photon is given by ''p'' = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{E}{c}&lt;/math&gt; and the wavelength (in a vacuum) by ''λ'' = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{c}{f}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum.

De Broglie's formula was confirmed three years later for [[electron]]s (which differ from photons in having a [[rest mass]]) with the observation of [[electron diffraction]] in two independent experiments. At the [[University of Aberdeen]], [[George Paget Thomson]] passed a beam of electrons through a thin metal film and observed the predicted interference patterns. At [[Bell Labs]], [[Clinton Joseph Davisson]] and [[Lester Halbert Germer]] [[Davisson-Germer experiment|guided their beam through a crystalline grid.]]

De Broglie was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1929 for his hypothesis. Thomson and Davisson shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1937 for their experimental work.

===Heisenberg's uncertainty principle===
{{Main|Heisenberg uncertainty principle}}

In his work on formulating quantum mechanics, [[Werner Heisenberg]] postulated his [[uncertainty principle]], which states:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta x \, \Delta p \ge \tfrac{1}{2}\hbar &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; here indicates [[standard deviation]], a measure of spread or uncertainty;
:'''x''' and '''p''' are a particle's position and [[linear momentum]] respectively.
:''&lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[Planck constant|reduced Planck's constant]] (Planck's constant divided by 2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;).

Heisenberg originally explained this as a consequence of the process of measuring: Measuring position accurately would disturb momentum and vice versa, offering an example (the "gamma-ray microscope") that depended crucially on the [[de Broglie hypothesis]]. The thought is now, however, that this only partly explains the phenomenon, but that the uncertainty also exists in the particle itself, even before the measurement is made.

In fact, the modern explanation of the uncertainty principle, extending the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] first put forward by [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], depends even more centrally on the wave nature of a particle: Just as it is nonsensical to discuss the precise location of a wave on a string, particles do not have perfectly precise positions; likewise, just as it is nonsensical to discuss the wavelength of a "pulse" wave traveling down a string, particles do not have perfectly precise momenta (which corresponds to the inverse of wavelength). Moreover, when position is relatively well defined, the wave is pulse-like and has a very ill-defined wavelength (and thus momentum). And conversely, when momentum (and thus wavelength) is relatively well defined, the wave looks long and sinusoidal, and therefore it has a very ill-defined position.

===de Broglie–Bohm theory===
{{main|de Broglie–Bohm theory}}
[[File:ExperimentCouder-Young.png|thumbnail|220px|Couder experiments,&lt;ref name="droplets"/&gt; "materializing" the ''pilot wave'' model.]]
De Broglie himself had proposed a [[pilot wave]] construct to explain the observed wave-particle duality. In this view, each particle has a well-defined position and momentum, but is guided by a wave function derived from [[Schrödinger's equation]]. The pilot wave theory was initially rejected because it generated non-local effects when applied to systems involving more than one particle. Non-locality, however, soon became established as an integral feature of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] (see [[EPR paradox]]), and [[David Bohm]] extended de Broglie's model to explicitly include it.

In the resulting representation, also called the [[de Broglie–Bohm theory]] or Bohmian mechanics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-bohm/ Bohmian Mechanics], ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.''&lt;/ref&gt; the wave-particle duality vanishes, and explains the wave behaviour as a scattering with wave appearance, because the particle's motion is subject to a guiding equation or [[quantum potential]].  ''"This idea seems to me so natural and simple, to resolve the wave-particle dilemma in such a clear and ordinary way, that it is a great mystery to me that it was so generally ignored"'',&lt;ref name="bell87"&gt;[[John Stewart Bell|Bell, J. S.]], "Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics", Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Stewart Bell|J.S.Bell]].

The best illustration of the ''pilot-wave model'' was given by Couder's 2010 "walking droplets" experiments,&lt;ref&gt;Y. Couder, A. Boudaoud, S. Protière, Julien Moukhtar, E. Fort: ''Walking droplets: a form of wave-particle duality at macroscopic level?'', {{doi|10.1051/epn/2010101}}, ([http://www.df.uba.ar/users/dasso/fis4_2do_cuat_2010/walker.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating the pilot-wave behaviour in a macroscopic mechanical analog.&lt;ref name="droplets"&gt;See this Science Channel production (Season II, Episode VI "How Does The Universe Work?"), presented by Morgan Freeman, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9yWv5dqSKk&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wave behavior of large objects==

Since the demonstrations of wave-like properties in [[photon]]s and [[electron]]s, similar experiments have been conducted with [[neutron]]s and [[proton]]s. Among the most famous experiments are those of [[Estermann]] and [[Otto Stern]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Estermann

Authors of similar recent experiments with atoms and molecules, described below, claim that these larger particles also act like waves.

A dramatic series of experiments emphasizing the action of [[gravity]] in relation to wave–particle duality was conducted in the 1970s using the [[neutron interferometer]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Colella, A. W. Overhauser and S. A. Werner, Observation of Gravitationally Induced Quantum Interference, ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'' '''34''', 1472–1474 (1975).&lt;/ref&gt; Neutrons, one of the components of the [[atomic nucleus]], provide much of the mass of a nucleus and thus of ordinary matter. In the neutron interferometer, they act as quantum-mechanical waves directly subject to the force of gravity. While the results were not surprising since gravity was known to act on everything, including light (see [[tests of general relativity]] and the [[Pound–Rebka experiment|Pound–Rebka falling photon experiment]]), the self-interference of the quantum mechanical wave of a massive fermion in a gravitational field had never been experimentally confirmed before.

In 1999, the diffraction of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; [[fullerene]]s by researchers from the [[University of Vienna]] was reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Markus | last = Arndt |author2=O.

In 2012, these far-field diffraction experiments could be extended to phthalocyanine molecules and their heavier derivatives, which are composed of 58 and 114 atoms respectively. In these experiments the build-up of such interference patterns could be recorded in real time and with single molecule sensitivity.&lt;ref name="Nano-20120325"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Juffmann, Thomas|title=Real-time single-molecule imaging of quantum interference |journal=Nature Nanotechnology |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=297–300 |url=http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nnano.2012.34.html |date=25 March 2012 |accessdate=27 March 2012 |display-authors=etal|doi=10.1038/nnano.2012.34 |pmid=22447163 |arxiv=1402.1867 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Quantumnanovienna|title=Single molecules in a quantum interference movie|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCiOMQIRU7I|accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance in modern quantum mechanics==

Wave–particle duality is deeply embedded into the foundations of [[quantum mechanics]]. In the [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]] of the theory, all the information about a particle is encoded in its [[wave function]], a complex-valued function roughly analogous to the amplitude of a wave at each point in space. This function evolves according to [[Schrödinger equation]]. For particles with mass this equation has solutions that follow the form of the wave equation. Propagation of such waves leads to wave-like phenomena such as interference and diffraction. Particles without mass, like photons, have no solutions of the Schrödinger equation so have another wave.

The particle-like behavior is most evident due to phenomena associated with [[measurement in quantum mechanics]]. Upon measuring the location of the particle, the particle will be forced into a more localized state as given by the uncertainty principle. When viewed through this formalism, the measurement of the wave function will randomly lead to [[wave function collapse]], or rather [[quantum decoherence]], to a sharply peaked function at some location. For particles with mass the likelihood of detecting the particle at any particular location is equal to the squared amplitude of the wave function there. The measurement will return a well-defined position,and subject to [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]]. It is important to note that a measurement is only a particular type of interaction where some data is recorded and the measured quantity is forced into a particular [[quantum state]]. The act of measurement is therefore not fundamentally different from any other interaction.

Following the development of [[quantum field theory]] the ambiguity disappeared. The field permits solutions that follow the wave equation, which are referred to as the wave functions. The term particle is used to label the irreducible representations of the [[Lorentz group]] that are permitted by the field. An interaction as in a [[Feynman diagram]] is accepted as a calculationally convenient approximation where the outgoing legs are known to be simplifications of the propagation and the internal lines are for some order in an expansion of the field interaction. Since the field is non-local and quantized, the phenomena which previously were thought of as paradoxes are explained. Within the limits of the wave-particle duality the quantum field theory gives the same results.

===Visualization===
There are two ways to visualize the wave-particle behaviour: by the "standard model", described below; and by the [[#de Broglie–Bohm theory|Broglie–Bohm model]], where no duality is perceived.

Below is an illustration of wave–particle duality as it relates to De Broglie's hypothesis and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle (above), in terms of the [[position and momentum space]] [[wavefunction]]s for one spinless particle with mass in one dimension. These wavefunctions are [[Fourier transform]]s of each other.

The more localized the position-space wavefunction, the more likely the particle is to be found with the position coordinates in that region, and correspondingly the momentum-space wavefunction is less localized so the possible momentum components the particle could have are more widespread.

Conversely the more localized the momentum-space wavefunction, the more likely the particle is to be found with those values of momentum components in that region, and correspondingly the less localized the position-space wavefunction, so the position coordinates the particle could occupy are more widespread.

==Alternative views==

Wave–particle duality is an ongoing conundrum in modern physics.  Most physicists accept wave-particle duality as the best explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena; however, it is not without controversy.  Alternative views are also presented here.  These views are not generally accepted by mainstream physics, but serve as a basis for valuable discussion within the community.

The [[pilot wave]] model, originally developed by [[Louis de Broglie]] and further developed by [[David Bohm]] into the [[hidden variable theory]] proposes that there is no duality, but rather a system exhibits both particle properties and wave properties simultaneously, and particles are guided, in a [[determinism|deterministic]] fashion, by the pilot wave (or its "[[quantum potential]]") which will direct them to areas of [[constructive interference]] in preference to areas of [[destructive interference]]. This idea is held by a significant minority within the physics community.&lt;ref&gt;(Buchanan pp. 29–31)&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one physicist considers the "wave-duality" as not being an incomprehensible mystery. L.E. Ballentine, ''Quantum Mechanics, A Modern Development'', p.&amp;nbsp;4, explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When first discovered, particle diffraction was a source of great puzzlement. Are "particles" really "waves?" In the early experiments, the diffraction patterns were detected holistically by means of a photographic plate, which could not detect individual particles. As a result, the notion grew that particle and wave properties were mutually incompatible, or complementary, in the sense that different measurement apparatuses would be required to observe them. That idea, however, was only an unfortunate generalization from a technological limitation. Today it is possible to detect the arrival of individual electrons, and to see the diffraction pattern emerge as a statistical pattern made up of many small spots (Tonomura et al., 1989). Evidently, quantum particles are indeed particles, but whose behaviour is very different from classical physics would have us to expect. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Afshar experiment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Afshar | first1 = S.S. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2007 | title = Paradox in Wave Particle Duality | arxiv=quant-ph/0702188 | journal = Found.

This claim is, however, disputed by other scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kastner|first=R|year=2005|title=Why the Afshar experiment does not refute complementarity|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|volume=36 |issue=4|pages=649–658|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2005.04.006|arxiv=quant-ph/0502021|bibcode=2005SHPMP..36..649K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steuernagel|first=Ole|date=2007-08-03|title=Afshar's Experiment Does Not Show a Violation of Complementarity|journal=Foundations of Physics|language=en|volume=37|issue=9|pages=1370–1385|doi=10.1007/s10701-007-9153-5|issn=0015-9018|arxiv=quant-ph/0512123|bibcode=2007FoPh...37.1370S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacques|first=V.|last2=Lai|first2=N.

=== Wave-only view ===
[[Carver Mead]], an American scientist and professor at Caltech, proposes that the duality can be replaced by a "wave-only" view. In his book ''Collective Electrodynamics: Quantum Foundations of Electromagnetism'' (2000), Mead purports to analyze the behavior of [[electron]]s and [[photon]]s purely in terms of electron wave functions, and attributes the apparent particle-like behavior to quantization effects and eigenstates. According to reviewer David Haddon:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Recovering Rational Science | author = David Haddon | work = Touchstone | accessdate = 2007-09-12 | url = http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=16-07-044-b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mead has cut the [[Gordian knot]] of quantum complementarity. He claims that atoms, with their neutrons, protons, and electrons, are not particles at all but pure waves of matter. Mead cites as the gross evidence of the exclusively wave nature of both light and matter the discovery between 1933 and 1996 of ten examples of pure wave phenomena, including the ubiquitous laser of [[CD player]]s, the self-propagating electrical currents of [[superconductor]]s, and the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] of atoms.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Albert Einstein]], who, in his search for a [[Unified Field Theory]], did not accept wave-particle duality, wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Arthur Schilpp]], ed, ''Albert Einstein:  Philosopher-Scientist'', Open Court (1949), {{ISBN|0-87548-133-7}}, p 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This double nature of radiation (and of material corpuscles) ... has been interpreted by quantum-mechanics in an ingenious and amazingly successful fashion. This interpretation ... appears to me as only a temporary way out...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[many-worlds interpretation]] (MWI) is sometimes presented as a waves-only theory, including by its originator, [[Hugh Everett]] who referred to MWI as "the wave interpretation".&lt;ref&gt;See section VI(e) of Everett's thesis: ''The Theory of the Universal Wave Function'', in [[Bryce Seligman DeWitt]], [[R. Neill Graham]], eds, ''The Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics'', Princeton Series in Physics, [[Princeton University Press]] (1973), {{ISBN|0-691-08131-X}}, pp 3–140.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''{{visible anchor|three wave hypothesis}}'' of R. Horodecki relates the particle to wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Horodecki |first=R. |title=De broglie wave and its dual wave |journal=Phys. Lett. A |volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=95–97 |year=1981 |doi=10.1016/0375-9601(81)90571-5 |bibcode = 1981PhLA...87...95H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Horodecki |first=R. |title=Superluminal singular dual wave |journal=Lettere al Nuovo Cimento |volume=38 |issue= |pages=509–511 |year=1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis implies that a massive particle is an intrinsically spatially, as well as temporally extended, wave phenomenon by a nonlinear law.

The ''{{visible anchor|deterministic collapse theory}}''&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Jabs, "A conjecture concerning determinism, reduction, and measurement in quantum mechanics", Quantum Studies: Mathematics and Foundations, '''3''' (4), 279-292 (2016) also arXiv:1204.0614 (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; considers collapse and measurement as two independent physical processes. Collapse occurs when two wavepackets spatially overlap and satisfy a mathemetical criterion, which depends on the parameters of both wavepackets. It is a contraction to the overlap volume. In a measurement apparatus one of the two wavepackets is one of the atomic clusters, which constitute the apparatus, and the wavepackets collapse to at most the volume of such a cluster. This mimics the action of a point particle.

===Particle-only view===

Still in the days of the [[old quantum theory]], a pre-quantum-mechanical version of wave–particle duality was pioneered by [[William Duane (physicist)|William Duane]],&lt;ref&gt;[[William Duane (physicist)|Duane, W.]] (1923). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1085314/pdf/pnas01878-0020.pdf The transfer in quanta of radiation momentum to matter, ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.'' '''9'''(5): 158–164].&lt;/ref&gt; and developed by others including [[Alfred Landé]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Landé|Landé, A.]] (1951). [https://openlibrary.org/books/OL23825865M/Quantum_mechanics ''Quantum Mechanics''], Sir Isaac Pitman and Sons, London, pp. 19–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Duane explained diffraction of [[x-rays]] by a crystal in terms solely of their particle aspect. The deflection of the trajectory of each diffracted photon was explained as due to [[Duane's hypothesis|quantized momentum transfer]] from the spatially regular structure of the diffracting crystal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1930). [http://philpapers.org/rec/HEITPP ''The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory''], translated by C. Eckart and F.C. Hoyt, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neither-wave-nor-particle view===

It has been argued that there are never exact particles or waves, but only some compromise or intermediate between them. For this reason, in 1928 [[Arthur Eddington]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Nature of the Physical World|last = Eddington|first = Arthur Stanley|publisher = MacMillan|year = 1928|isbn = |location = Cambridge, UK.|pages = 201|url = https://archive.org/details/natureofphysical00eddi}}&lt;/ref&gt; coined the name "''wavicle''" to describe the objects although it is not regularly used today. One consideration
is that zero-dimensional [[point (geometry)|mathematical points]] cannot be observed. Another is that the formal representation of such points, the [[Dirac delta function]] is unphysical, because it cannot be [[Normalisable wave function|normalized]]. Parallel arguments apply to pure wave states.  [[Roger Penrose]] states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe |first=Roger |last=Penrose |authorlink=Roger Penrose |publisher=Vintage |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-679-77631-4 |page=521, §21.10|title-link=The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Such 'position states' are idealized wavefunctions in the opposite sense from the momentum states. Whereas the momentum states are infinitely spread out, the position states are infinitely concentrated. Neither is normalizable [...]."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Relational approach to wave–particle duality===
[[Relational quantum mechanics]] has been developed as a point of view that regards the event of particle detection as having established a relationship between the quantized field and the detector. The inherent ambiguity associated with applying Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is consequently avoided; hence there is no wave-particle duality.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quantum-relativity.org/Quantum-Relativity.pdf. See Q. Zheng and T. Kobayashi, ''Quantum Optics as a Relativistic Theory of Light''; Physics Essays 9 (1996) 447. Annual Report, Department of Physics, School of Science, University of Tokyo (1992) 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is difficult to draw a line separating wave–particle duality from the rest of quantum mechanics, it is nevertheless possible to list some applications of this basic idea.

* Wave–particle duality is exploited in [[electron microscopy]], where the small wavelengths associated with the electron can be used to view objects much smaller than what is visible using visible light.
* Similarly, [[neutron diffraction]] uses neutrons with a wavelength of about 0.1&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]], the typical spacing of atoms in a solid, to determine the structure of solids.
* Photos are now able to show this dual nature, which may lead to new ways of examining and recording this behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://actu.epfl.ch/news/the-first-ever-photograph-of-light-as-both-a-parti/|title=Press release: The first ever photograph of light as both a particle and wave|website=|publisher=Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne|date=2 March 2015|last1=Papageorgiou|first1=Nik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''White Paper of 1939'''&lt;ref group=note&gt;Occasionally also known as the '''MacDonald White Paper''' (e.g. Caplan, 2015, p.117) after [[Malcolm MacDonald]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]] who presided over its creation.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[White paper|policy paper]] issued by the [[British government]] under [[Neville Chamberlain]] in response to the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936–39 Arab Revolt]]. Following its formal approval in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 23 May 1939,&lt;ref&gt;Hansard, [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1939/may/22/palestine-1 HC Deb 22 May 1939 vol 347 cc1937-2056] and [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1939/may/23/palestine HC Deb 23 May 1939 vol 347 cc2129-97]; "Resolved, That this House approves the policy of His Majesty's Government relating to Palestine as set out in Command Paper No. 6019."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;by 268 votes to 179.&lt;/ref&gt; it acted as the governing policy for [[Mandatory Palestine]] from 1939 until the British departure in 1948, the matter of the Mandate meanwhile [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|having been referred to the United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Hansard, [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1947/feb/18/palestine-conference-government-policy HC Deb 18 February 1947 vol 433 cc985-94]: "We have, therefore, reached the conclusion that the only course now open to us is to submit the problem to the judgment of the United Nations ... &lt;br&gt;[[Barnett Janner, Baron Janner|Mr. Janner]] Pending the remitting of this question to the United Nations, are we to understand that the Mandate stands. and that we shall deal with the situation of immigration and land restrictions on the basis of the terms of the Mandate, and that the White Paper of 1939 will be abolished? ... &lt;br&gt;[[Ernest Bevin|Mr. Bevin]] No, Sir. We have not found a substitute yet for that White Paper, and up to the moment, whether it is right or wrong, the House is committed to it. That is the legal position. We did, by arrangement and agreement, extend the period of immigration which would have terminated in December, 1945. Whether there will be any further change, my right hon. Friend the Colonial Secretary, who, of course, is responsible for the administration of the policy, will be considering later."&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy, first drafted in March 1939, was prepared by the British government unilaterally as a result of the failure of the Arab-Zionist [[London Conference (1939)|London Conference]].{{sfn|Caplan|2015|p=114|ps=: "As it had been made clear from the start, the absence of agreement at the St James's Conference meant that the British were left, after March 17th 1939, to finalise and to enforce their new Palestine policy unilaterally. A White Paper, first drafted in late March, was not published until early May, thus affording Arabs and Jews further opportunities to continue their efforts at influencing the final terms of the proposed British policy."}} The paper called for the establishment of a Jewish national home in an independent Palestinian state within 10 years, rejecting the [[Peel Commission|idea of partitioning]] [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].  It also limited Jewish immigration to 75,000 for 5 years, and ruled that further immigration was to be determined by the Arab majority (section II).  Restrictions were put on the rights of Jews to buy land from Arabs (section III).

The proposal did not meet the political demands proposed by Arab representatives during the [[London Conference (1939)|London Conference]] and was officially rejected by the representatives of Palestine Arab parties acting under the influence of [[Haj Amin Husseini|Haj Amin Eff el Husseini]] while more moderate Arab opinion represented in the National Defence Party was prepared to accept the White Paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Official Records of the Second Session of the General Assembly|title=United Nations Special Committee on Palestine 1947| publisher=United Nations|url=https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/07175DE9FA2DE563852568D3006E10F3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zionist groups in Palestine immediately rejected the White Paper. There was a campaign of attacks on government property, which lasted for several months. On 18 May a Jewish general strike was called.&lt;ref name="Inquiry. p.54"&gt;''A Survey of Palestine - prepared in December 1945 and January 1946 for the information of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry.'' Reprinted 1991 by The Institute of Palestine Studies, Washington. Volumes One: {{ISBN|0-88728-211-3}}. p.54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulations governing land transfers and clauses relating to immigration were implemented although at the end of the five-year period in 1944, only 51,000 of the 75,000 immigration certificates provided for had been utilized. In circumstances where Jewish refugees from Europe were fleeing violence and persecution, the White Paper's limits were relaxed and legal immigration was permitted to continue indefinitely at the rate of 18,000 a year.&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;Study (30 June 1978): [https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/AEAC80E740C782E4852561150071FDB0 The Origins and Evolution of the Palestine Problem Part I: 1917-1947 - Study (30 June 1978)], accessdate: November 10, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Key provisions were ultimately never to be implemented, initially because of cabinet opposition following the change in government, and later because of preoccupation with World War II.{{sfn|Khalaf|1991|p=66|ps=: "The White Paper was never to be implemented, initially because of Cabinet opposition and then because of preoccupation with the war effort. However, 1939 and the first two years of the war saw a quiet, low key dialogue between the government and Palestinians who were ready to accept the White Paper. But the government's intention was to keep the Arabs placated, encourage the moderates, and continue to talk but promise very little, particularly on the constitutional provisions contained in the White Paper."}}

During [[World War I]], the British had made two promises regarding territory in the [[Middle East]]. Britain had promised the [[Hashemite]] governors of [[Arabia]], through [[T. E. Lawrence|Lawrence of Arabia]] and the [[Hussein-McMahon Correspondence]], independence for a united Arab country covering [[Syria]] in exchange for their supporting the British against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottoman Caliphate had declared a military [[jihad]] in support of the Germans and it was hoped that an alliance with the Arabs would quell the chances of a general Muslim uprising in British-held territories in Africa, India, and the Far East.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n706ShSYt-sC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=&amp;ei=VaM7SeidLKPCM-2J5L8D&amp;client=#PPA54,M1 King Husain and the Kingdom of Hejaz, Randall Baker, Oleander Press, 1979], {{ISBN|0-900891-48-3}}, page 54&lt;/ref&gt; Great Britain had also negotiated the [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]], agreeing to partition the Middle East between Britain and [[France]].

A variety of strategic factors, such as securing Jewish support in Eastern Europe as the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Russian front]] collapsed, culminated in the [[Balfour Declaration, 1917]], with Britain promising to create and foster a Jewish national home in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. These broad delineations of territory and goals for both the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, and Arab self-determination was approved in the [[San Remo conference]].

In June 1922 the [[League of Nations]] approved the Palestine Mandate with effect from September 1923. The Palestine Mandate was an explicit document regarding Britain's responsibilities and powers of administration in Palestine including 'secur[ing] the establishment of the Jewish national home', and 'safeguarding the civil and religious rights of all the inhabitants of Palestine'. In September 1922, the British government [[Transjordan memorandum|presented a memorandum]] to the League of Nations stating that [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] would be excluded from all the provisions dealing with Jewish settlement, in accordance with Article 25 of the Mandate, and this memorandum was approved on 23 September. Due to stiff Arab opposition and pressure against Jewish immigration, Britain redefined Jewish immigration by restricting its flow according to the country's economic capacity to absorb the immigrants. In effect annual quotas were put in place as to how many Jews could immigrate, while Jews possessing a large sum of money (£500) were allowed to enter the country freely.

Following [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power]], a growing number of European Jews were prepared to spend the money necessary to enter Palestine. The 1935 [[Nuremberg Laws]] stripped the 500,000 German Jews of their citizenship. Jewish migration was impeded by Nazi restrictions on the transfer of finances abroad (departing Jews had to abandon their property), but the [[Jewish Agency]] was able to negotiate an agreement allowing Jews resident in Germany to buy German goods for export to Palestine thus circumventing the restrictions.

The large numbers of Jews entering Palestine{{Elucidate|reason=The reason for the Arab revolt were Economical, Political and Social. The mostly Jewish immigration from Europe aggravated those problems by bringing progress, but wasn't the sole reason for it|date=January 2014}} led to the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]]. Britain responded to the Arab revolt by appointing a [[Royal Commission]], known as the [[Peel Commission]] which traveled out to Palestine and undertook a thorough study of the issues. The Peel Commission recommended in 1937 that Palestine be partitioned into two states, one Arab the other Jewish. In January 1938, the [[Woodhead Commission]] explored the practicalities of partition. The Woodhead Commission considered three different plans, one of which was based on the Peel plan. Reporting in 1938, the Commission rejected the Peel plan primarily on the grounds that it could not be implemented without a massive forced transfer of Arabs (an option that the British government had already ruled out).&lt;ref name="WoodheadReport1938"&gt;{{cite web|title=Woodhead commission report |url=https://archive.org/details/WoodheadCommission}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With dissent from some of its members, the Commission instead recommended a plan that would leave the Galilee under British mandate, but emphasised serious problems with it that included a lack of financial self-sufficiency of the proposed Arab State.&lt;ref name="WoodheadReport1938"/&gt; The British Government accompanied the publication of the Woodhead Report by a statement of policy rejecting partition as impracticable due to "political, administrative and financial difficulties".&lt;ref&gt;Statement by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, Presented by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to Parliament by Command of His Majesty November, 1938. {{cite web|url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/4941922311B4E3C585256D17004BD2E2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103061306/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/4941922311B4E3C585256D17004BD2E2 |archivedate=2013-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposed a substantially smaller Jewish state, including the coastal plain only. An [[Évian Conference|international conference]] (Évian Conference) convened by the United States in July 1938, failed to find any agreement to deal with the rapidly growing number of Jewish refugees.

In February 1939 the British called the [[London Conference (1939)|London Conference]] to negotiate an agreement between Arabs and Jews in Palestine. The Arab delegates attended on condition that they would not meet directly with the Jewish representatives, which would constitute recognition of Jewish claims over Palestine. So the British government held separate meetings with the two sides. The conference ended in failure on March 17.&lt;ref name="avalon.law.yale.edu"&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/angap04.asp Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry - Appendix IV] Palestine: Historical Background&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of World War II, the British believed that Jewish support was guaranteed or unimportant. However they feared that the Arab world might turn against them. This geopolitical consideration was, in [[Raul Hilberg]]'s word, "decisive"&lt;ref&gt;[[Raul Hilberg|Hilberg, Raul]], ''The Destruction of the European Jews'', (1961) New Viewpoints, New York 1973 p.716&lt;/ref&gt; to British policies. [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] were independent and allied with Britain.

The main points of the White Paper were:
*'''Section I. The Constitution''': It stated that with over 450,000 Jews having now settled in the mandate, the Balfour Declaration about "a national home for the Jewish people" had been met and called for an independent Palestine established within 10 years, governed jointly by Arabs and Jews:

&lt;blockquote&gt;His Majesty's Government believe that the framers of the Mandate in which the Balfour Declaration was embodied could not have intended that Palestine should be converted into a Jewish State against the will of the Arab population of the country. [ ... ] His Majesty's Government therefore now declare unequivocally that it is not part of their policy that Palestine should become a Jewish State. They would indeed regard it as contrary to their obligations to the Arabs under the Mandate, as well as to the assurances which have been given to the Arab people in the past, that the Arab population of Palestine should be made the subjects of a Jewish State against their will.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The objective of His Majesty's Government is the establishment within 10 years of an independent Palestine State in such treaty relations with the United Kingdom as will provide satisfactorily for the commercial and strategic requirements of both countries in the future. [..] The independent State should be one in which Arabs and Jews share government in such a way as to ensure that the essential interests of each community are safeguarded.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*'''Section II. Immigration''': Jewish immigration to Palestine under the British Mandate was to be limited to 75,000 over the next five years, after which it would depend on Arab consent:

&lt;blockquote&gt;His Majesty's Government do not [..] find anything in the Mandate or in subsequent Statements of Policy to support the view that the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine cannot be effected unless immigration is allowed to continue indefinitely. If immigration has an adverse effect on the economic position in the country, it should clearly be restricted; and equally, if it has a seriously damaging effect on the political position in the country, that is a factor that should not be ignored. Although it is not difficult to contend that the large number of Jewish immigrants who have been admitted so far have been absorbed economically, the fear of the Arabs that this influx will continue indefinitely until the Jewish population is in a position to dominate them has produced consequences which are extremely grave for Jews and Arabs alike and for the peace and prosperity of Palestine. The lamentable disturbances of the past three years are only the latest and most sustained manifestation of this intense Arab apprehension [ ... ] it cannot be denied that fear of indefinite Jewish immigration is widespread amongst the Arab population and that this fear has made possible disturbances which have given a serious setback to economic progress, depleted the Palestine exchequer, rendered life and property insecure, and produced a bitterness between the Arab and Jewish populations which is deplorable between citizens of the same country. If in these circumstances immigration is continued up to the economic absorptive capacity of the country, regardless of all other considerations, a fatal enmity between the two peoples will be perpetuated, and the situation in Palestine may become a permanent source of friction amongst all peoples in the Near and Middle East.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jewish immigration during the next five years will be at a rate which, if economic absorptive capacity permits, will bring the Jewish population up to approximately one third of the total population of the country. Taking into account the expected natural increase of the Arab and Jewish populations, and the number of illegal Jewish immigrants now in the country, this would allow of the admission, as from the beginning of April this year, of some 75,000 immigrants over the next four years. These immigrants would, subject to the criterion of economic absorptive capacity, be admitted as follows: For each of the next five years a quota of 10,000 Jewish immigrants will be allowed on the understanding that a shortage one year may be added to the quotas for subsequent years, within the five-year period, if economic absorptive capacity permits. In addition, as a contribution towards the solution of the Jewish refugee problem, 25,000 refugees will be admitted as soon as the [[High Commissioner]] is satisfied that adequate provision for their maintenance is ensured, special consideration being given to refugee children and dependents. The existing machinery for ascertaining economic absorptive capacity will be retained, and the High Commissioner will have the ultimate responsibility for deciding the limits of economic capacity. Before each periodic decision is taken, Jewish and Arab representatives will be consulted. After the period of five years, no further Jewish immigration will be permitted unless the Arabs of Palestine are prepared to acquiesce in it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*'''Section III. Land''': Previously no restriction had been imposed on the transfer of land from Arabs to Jews, while now the ''White Paper'' stated: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Reports of several expert Commissions have indicated that, owing to the natural growth of the Arab population and the steady sale in recent years of Arab land to Jews, there is now in certain areas no room for further transfers of Arab land, whilst in some other areas such transfers of land must be restricted if Arab cultivators are to maintain their existing standard of life and a considerable landless Arab population is not soon to be created. In these circumstances, the High Commissioner will be given general powers to prohibit and regulate transfers of land.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Parliamentary Approval===
On 22 May 1939 the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] debated a motion that the White Paper was inconsistent with the terms of the Mandate. It was defeated by 268 votes to 179. The following day the [[House of Lords]] accepted the new policy without a vote.&lt;ref&gt;''A Survey of Palestine - prepared in December 1945 and January 1946 for the information of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry.'' Reprinted 1991 by The Institute of Palestine Studies, Washington. Volume one. {{ISBN|0-88728-211-3}}. p.54.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the debate, [[Lloyd George]] called the White Paper an "act of perfidy" while [[Winston Churchill]] voted against the government of his party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Manchester Guardian |title = The Broadcast Debate: "An Act of Perfidy" Mr. Lloyd George's Attack On Plan | date=24 May 1939 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[James Armand de Rothschild|James Rothschild]] stated during the parliamentary debate that "for the majority of the Jews who go to Palestine it is a question of migration or of physical extinction".&lt;ref&gt;[[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] Debates, Volume 347 column 1984 [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1939/may/22/palestine-1#column_1984]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some supporters of the Conservative {{Citation needed|reason=mistake. i.e. conservative|date=January 2014}} Government were opposed to the policy on the grounds that it appeared in their view to contradict the [[Balfour Declaration]]. Several government MPs either voted against the proposals or abstained, including Cabinet Ministers such as the illustrious Jewish [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Leslie Hore-Belisha, 1st Baron Hore-Belisha|Leslie Hore-Belisha]].&lt;ref name="Morris2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benny Morris|title=Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGtVsBne7PgC&amp;pg=PA158|date=25 May 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-78805-4|pages=158–159|quote=The White Paper was denounced as 'illegal,' as it contradicted the terms of the Mandate, [ ... ] In Britain, although the Conservatives had a comfortable majority in Parliament, the government was put on the defensive: Two cabinet ministers (Leslie Hore-Belisha and Walter Elliot) and 110 Conservative MPs abstained, and all of Labour's MPs voted against. Also voting against were twenty Conservative dissidents including Churchill ... }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===League of Nations===
The supervising authority of the League of Nations, the [[Permanent Mandates Commission]] abstained unanimously from endorsing the White Paper,{{Citation needed|reason=mistake. Four out of seven rejected the paper, while the other three members have not supported it|date=January 2014}} though four out of seven members thought the new policy was inconsistent with that mandate.&lt;ref&gt;Hilberg, Raul, ''The Destruction of the European Jews,'' (1961) New Viewpoints, New York 1973 p.717 n.7&lt;/ref&gt; The League of Nations commission rejected the White Paper because it was in conflict with the terms of the Mandate as put forth in the past. The outbreak of the Second World War suspended any further deliberations.&lt;ref name="avalon.law.yale.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris2011p159"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benny Morris|title=Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGtVsBne7PgC|date=25 May 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-78805-4|page=159|chapter=chp. 4|quote="Capping it all, the Permanent Mandates Commission of the Council of the League of Nations rejected the White Paper as inconsistent with the terms of the Mandate."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arab Reactions===
The [[Arab Higher Committee]] initially argued that the independence of a future Palestine Government would prove to be illusory, as the Jews could prevent its functioning by withholding participation, and in any case real authority would still be in the hands of British officials. The limitations on Jewish immigration were also held to be insufficient, as there was no guarantee immigration would not resume after five years. In place of the policy enunciated in the White Paper, the Arab Higher Committee called for "a complete and final prohibition" of Jewish immigration and a repudiation of the Jewish national home policy altogether.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In June 1939,{{sfn|Khalif|1991|p=283}} Hajj [[Amin al-Husayni]] initially "astonished" the other members of the Arab Higher Committee by turning down the White Paper. Al-Husayni, according to [[Benny Morris]], turned the advantageous proposal down for the entirely selfish reason that "it did not place him at the helm of the future Palestinian state."&lt;ref&gt;[[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]], "The Tangled Truth", ''[[The New Republic]]'', May '07, '08 [https://newrepublic.com/article/books/the-tangled-truth]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1940, after two weeks of meetings with the British representative [[S. F. Newcombe]],{{sfn|Cohen|2014|p=367|ps=: "In July 1940, Colonel S.F. Newcombe. an Arabist who had served with T.E. Lawrence during World War One, made a Middle East tour sponsored by the British Council. His mission was to improve Arab public opinion about Britain. The government agreed that he should stop over in Baghdad to try unofficially, with the help of Nuri al-Said, to obtain the Mufti's endorsement of the While Paper. On his way Newcombe was briefed in Jerusalem by the High Commissioner. He was instructed to meet only with Nuri al-Said and with two prominent Palestinians. Jamal Husayni the Multi's cousin, and Musa Alami, but not with the Mufti himself. Newcombe stayed in Baghdad for 2 weeks."}} the leader of the Palestinian Arab delegates to the [[London Conference (1939)|London Conference]], [[Jamal al-Husseini]] and fellow delegate [[Musa al-Alami]], agreed to the terms of the White Paper and both signed a copy of it in the presence of the Prime Minister of Iraq, [[Nuri as-Said]].&lt;ref&gt;Buheiry, Marwan R. (1989) ''The Formation and Perception of the Modern Arab World. Studies by Marwan R Buheiry.'' Edited by Lawrence I. Conrad. Darwin Press, Princeton. {{ISBN|0-87850-064-2}}. p.177&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zionist Reactions===
Zionist groups in Palestine immediately rejected the White Paper and began a campaign of attacks on government property and Arab civilians which lasted for several months. On 18 May a Jewish general strike was called.&lt;ref name="Inquiry. p.54"/&gt;

On 27 February 1939, in response to enthusiastic Arab demonstrations following reports that the British were proposing to allow Palestine independence on the same terms as Iraq, a coordinated [[Irgun]] bombing campaign across the country killed 38 Arabs and wounded 44.&lt;ref&gt;Kayyali, Abdul-Wahhab Said (no date) ''Palestine. A Modern History'' Croom Helm. {{ISBN|086199-007-2}}. p.221.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the White Paper, the right-wing Zionist militant group [[Irgun]] began formulating plans for a rebellion to evict the British and establish an independent Jewish state. [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]], the founder of Irgun, who had been exiled from Palestine by the British, proposed a plan for a revolt to take place in October 1939, which he sent to the Irgun High Command in six coded letters. Under Jabotinsky's plan, he, together with other "illegals", would arrive in Palestine by boat, and the Irgun would help him and other passengers escape. Next, the Irgun would raid and occupy Government House, as well as other British centers of power in Palestine, raise the Jewish national flag, and hold them for at least 24 hours even at a heavy cost. Simultaneously, Zionist leaders in Western Europe and the United States would proclaim an independent Jewish state in Palestine, and would function as a government-in-exile. Irgun seriously considered carrying out the plan, but was concerned over the heavy losses it would doubtless incur. Irgun leader [[Avraham Stern]] (who would later break from Irgun to form [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]]), formed a plan for 40,000 armed Jewish fighters recruited in Europe to sail to Palestine and join the rebellion. The Polish government supported his plan, and began training Jews and setting aside weaponry for them. However, the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939 quickly put an end to these plans.&lt;ref&gt;Zev Golan: ''Free Jerusalem: Heroes, Heroines and Rogues who Created the State of Israel''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Penkower, Monty Noam: Decision on Palestine Deferred: America, Britain and Wartime Diplomacy, 1939-1945&lt;/ref&gt;

After the outbreak of war in September 1939, the head of the [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency for Palestine]] [[David Ben-Gurion]] declared: 'We will fight the White Paper as if there is no war, and fight the war as if there is no White Paper.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Jewish Brigade|The Brigade]] by Howard Blum, p.5. In 1946, a [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] song published in the ''[[Yishuv]]'' by Jacob Jacobs ad Isadore Lilian included these lyrics: ''Tserisn muz vern dos vayse papir, In der fremd viln mir mer nit zayn. Habeyt mishomyim ureey, Groyser got kuk arop un ze, Vi men yogt undz, vi men plot undz, Got, her oys undzer geshrey.'' "They don't care about Jewish anguish, The [[White Paper]] must be torn, We don't want to be away from our home anymore." (As described in "Palestine in Song," ''YIVO News'' No. 204, Winter 2008, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent events==
On 13 July the authorities announced the suspension of all Jewish immigration into Palestine until March 1940. The reason given for this decision was the increase in illegal immigrants arriving.&lt;ref&gt;''Survey''. p.56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1940, the British High Commissioner for Palestine issued an edict dividing Palestine into three zones. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In Zone A, consisting of about 63 percent of the country including the stony hills, land transfers save to a Palestinian Arab were in general forbidden. In Zone B. consisting of about 32 percent of the country, transfers from a Palestinian Arab save to another Palestinian Arab were severely restricted at the discretion of the High Commissioner. In the remainder of Palestine, consisting of about five percent of the country-which, however, includes the most fertile areas - land sales remained unrestricted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]] - Appendix IV
 copy at [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/angap04.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In December 1942, when extermination of the Jews became public knowledge, there were 34,000 immigration certificates remaining.  In February 1943, the British government announced that the remaining certificates could be used as soon as practicable to rescue Jewish children from southeastern Europe, particularly Bulgaria.  This plan was partly successful but many people who received certificates were not able to emigrate (but those in Bulgaria survived).&lt;ref name="ofer"&gt;Ofer, Dalia, ''Escaping the Holocaust'' (1990) pages 218ff, 290.&lt;/ref&gt; In July it was announced that any Jewish refugee who reached a neutral country in transit would be given clearance for Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Ofer, Dalia, ''Escaping the Holocaust'' (1990) page 219&lt;/ref&gt; During 1943 about half the remaining certificates were distributed,&lt;ref&gt;Ofer, Dalia, ''Escaping the Holocaust'' (1990) page 290&lt;/ref&gt; and by the end of the war there were 3,000 certificates left.&lt;ref&gt;Ovendale, R, "The Palestine Policy of the British Labour Government 1945-1946", ''International Affairs'', Vol. 55, pages 409-431.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of World War II, the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] conference voted to rescind the White Paper and establish a Jewish state in Palestine, however the Labour Foreign Minister, [[Ernest Bevin]] persisted with the policy and it remained in effect until the British departed Palestine in May 1948.

After the war, the determination of [[After the Holocaust|Holocaust survivors]] to reach Palestine led to large scale [[Aliyah Bet|illegal Jewish migration]] to Palestine. British efforts to block the migration led to violent resistance by the Zionist underground.

Illegal immigrants detained by the British Government were interned in [[Jews in British camps on Cyprus|camps on Cyprus]]. The immigrants had no citizenship and could not be returned to any country. Those interned included a large number of children and orphans.

From October 1946, the British Government, under the 'severest pressure' from the USA, relented and allowed 1,500 Jewish migrants a month into Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Hilberg, Raul ''The Destruction of the European Jews'', (1971) New Viewpoints ed. New York, 1973 p.729&lt;/ref&gt; The gesture was in deference to the recommendations of the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]].&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Anglo-American Committee'' (1946) Cmd.6808 pp.65-66&lt;/ref&gt; Half of those admitted came from the [[Cyprus internment camps|prison camps for illegal immigrants in Cyprus]] due to fears that a growing Jewish presence in Cyprus would lead to an uprising there.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Times]]'' 11/08/46{{clarify|date=March 2013}} pg 35, UK Foreign Office document 371/52651&lt;/ref&gt;

The Provisional Council of Israel's first constitutional act was a Proclamation that "All legislation resulting from the British Government's White Paper of May, 1939, will at midnight tonight become null and void. This includes the immigration provisions as well as the land transfer regulations of February, 1940."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Proclamation by Head of Government, Sunday May 16, 1948 |url= http://info.jpost.com/1998/Supplements/1948/features.html |work=''The Palestine Post'' Internet Edition |publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Yabo'''''|野暮}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term describing something that is unaesthetic or unappealing. ''Yabo'' is the antonym of ''[[Iki (aesthetic ideal)|iki]]''. ''Busui'' (無粋), literally "non-''iki''", is synonymous with ''yabo''. A non-''iki'' thing is not necessarily ''yabo'' but probably is. Something that is ''yabo'' is usually unrefined, gigantic, coarse, childish, colorful, self-conscious, permanent, loud, superficial, vulgar, snobbish, boorish, etc.

The word ''yabo'' was often used by city dwellers, or ''[[Chōnin]]'' (especially those of [[Edo]]). It often refers to [[samurai]] and farmers (''[[nomin]])'' from outside Edo, but could also be applied to another ''chonin''. The city dwellers of Edo sometimes called themselves ''[[Edokko]]'' (similar to ''New Yorker'' or ''Parisian''). Proud of having been born and raised in Edo, they had a tendency to despise outsiders. However, the origins of many chonin could be traced back to other areas and backgrounds.

The meaning of the term has expanded and generalized through the [[modernization of Japan]]. Today, the word ''yabo'' is used more frequently than ''[[iki (aesthetic ideal)|iki]]''.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

'''Éraic''' (or ''eric'') was the [[Ireland|Irish]] equivalent of the [[Wales|Welsh]] [[galanas]] and the [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Scandinavia]]n [[weregild]], a form of tribute paid in reparation for murder or other major crimes. The term survived into the sixteenth century as ''{{lang|ga|eiric}}'', by then relating only to compensation for the killing of an Irishman. In the case of homicide, if the attacker fled, the fine had to be paid by the tribe to which he belonged.&lt;ref name="Wake1878"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Staniland Wake|title=The Evolution of Morality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hdWAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA363|year=1878|publisher=Trübner &amp; Company|pages=363–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Irish mythology the eraic takes an important place. In the [[Cian|''Oidheadh Chloinne Tuireann'']], the children of Tuirreann owe an eraic to Lugh. Lug set them a series of seemingly impossible quests as recompense. They achieved them all, but were fatally wounded in completing the last one.
