[[File:Ayyab letter mp3h8880.jpg|thumb|right|340px|[[Amarna letter EA 364|EA 364]], (Obverse), a much smaller [[Amarna letter]].]]

'''Amarna letter EA 147''', titled: '''''"A Hymn to the Pharaoh"'''''&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Moran|Moran, William L.]] 1987, 1992. ''The Amarna Letters.'' EA 147, ''"A Hymn to the Pharaoh"'', pp. 233-35.&lt;/ref&gt; is a moderate length [[clay tablet]] [[Amarna letter]] (mid 14th century BC) from [[Abimilku]] of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]-(called ''Ṣurru'' in the Abimilku letters, and an '''[[island]]''', until the time of '''[[Alexander the Great]]''', 330 BC). The letter is a twin letter to [[Amarna letter EA 149|EA 149]], which is identical in length, and complexity, and EA 147 appears to precede EA 149.

Letter 147 is in the category of ''Amarna letters'', which has the following specifics:

#&amp;ndash;EA 147 is undamaged (with few minor surface scrapes).
#&amp;ndash;It is of moderate length, a single [[clay tablet]] (not part of a series, ex 2-tablet letter, or a listing like [[Amarna letter EA 12|EA 12]] or [[Amarna letter EA 22|22]]).
#&amp;ndash;It has clarity of [[cuneiform]] characters, probably for two reasons: A&amp;ndash;The execution of the scribe; and B&amp;ndash;The preparation of a [[clay]] mixture (probably with added ingredients), which caused a hardened [[clay tablet]]. (The [[scribe]]'s story, demanded a higher performing clay tablet.)
#&amp;ndash;The Letter 147 story contains: ''Obverse:''&amp;mdash;Introduction &amp; Clause 1; ''Bottom''&amp;mdash;An ending to the Obverse, and transition to Reverse; ''Reverse''-(Clause 2 &amp; 3), which begins (line 30), with the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word for '''''"Help"''''' (and standing alone, with the next 2-words of ''line 30'' beginning the start of Clause 2), and with the Reverse ending with two [[glossenkeil]]s (line 56, only 2 words), translated as '''[[glossenkeil|:gl]] "I am at rest";''' and '''[[glossenkeil|:gl]] "I am confident"'''&lt;ref&gt;Moran, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; (end of line). (Note: there are multiple [[paragraph]]s and sub-paragraphs in EA 147, a 4-section letter, &amp; see the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] cuneiform section.)
#&amp;ndash;The story of EA 147, is that it is a missive on ''A Hymn to the Pharaoh'' (in 3 "duplicating clauses"). Clause 4 is the information to the Pharaoh, and the EA 147 ending. (Note: one would have to predict whether the layout of the letter was totally planned. The actual ''information'' in the letter (to the [[Pharaoh]], or his post office), only begins after the Reverse Side (beginning of the closing Clause 4 section), continuing from lines ''57-60'', and then continuing to the ''Left Side'', for 8 lines, lines ''64-71''. The very last line (''71''), the Scribe writes: ''Enūma idû'', ''"Now (at this time), Know !"'' (Now, be informed !).
#&amp;ndash;The ''Reverse'' '''(Clauses 2 &amp; 3)''', is separated by an ''"Exclamation"'', (an [[Interjection]]), line 40: '''''"I carry''''' (bring), '''''the Causes (intentions)''''' (Akkadian: amatu (word, matter)),&lt;ref&gt;Parpola, 197l. ''The Standard Babylonian [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', Glossary, pp. 119-145, '''amatu''', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; '''''King-Lord&lt;sup&gt;[[li (cuneiform)|Li]]&lt;/sup&gt;-mine!"''''' (Almost certainly, the [[scribe]]&amp;mdash;(or [[Abimilku]]):&amp;ndash;A, intended to get to the '''Reverse''' side in the manner that he did; B, had to get through "Clause 3" to the ending of the ''Reverse'', with its 2 closing [[glossenkeil]]s). How he continued to the end of the letter would have to be speculation. And,.. remembering whether [[Abimilku]] played a part in the formation of this '' great story'', letter 147.
#&amp;ndash;Because Letter 147 contains ''3-duplicating clauses'', [[Akkadian language]] words, and some phrases, are repeated. For example 3 times for the phrase ''day-by-day'' ("day and day", in the letter). It is used twice in Clause 1, ''Obverse'' (paragraph I-b) &amp; the ''Bottom'' transition to the ''Reverse'' (the ending of Clause 1). The third usage is in the letter's ending, (Clause 4).
#&amp;ndash;Letter 147 uses 6 [[glossenkeil]]s (a high number usage).

==General overview of Letter 147==

The letter concerns the intrigues of neighboring [[city-state]]s and their rulers; however the letter is a missive on the ''religious setting of Tyre'', and the ''personal explanation'' of the view of the Pharaoh of Egypt, in a ''religious, and righteous 'way of life' of the people of Tyre'' towards Egypt, and the Pharaoh, as the Sun God.

The [[clay tablet]] letter is written on the ''Obverse, Bottom, Reverse,'' ''Top(which is bottom of Reverse),'' and ''Left Side'', leaving no spaces, not inscribed. The [[British Museum]] website for the EA 147, letter (with photo of Reverse), gives the approximated dimensions as: 3.1/4 X 2 1/4 in, ( {{convert|3.25|in|mm|0}} / {{convert|2.25|in|mm|0}}, or ''8.3 cm X 5.7 cm'' ). See photo and write-up of EA 147 here [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=274311&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=29812&amp;page=1].

EA 147 is located at the [[British Museum]], no 29812. Tablet letter EA 147 can be viewed here: [https://cdli.ucla.edu/search/search_results.php?SearchMode=Text&amp;ObjectID=P270914]. (With [[cuneiform]] text, and a line drawing.)

The [[Amarna letters]], about 300, numbered up to EA 382, are mid 14th century BC, about [[1360 BC]] and 35? years later, [[Text corpus|correspondence]]. The initial corpus of letters were found at [[Akhenaten]]'s city [[Akhetaten]], in the floor of the [[Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh]]; others were later found, adding to the body of letters.

'''Amarna letter EA 282''', is a relatively short ovate [[clay tablet]] [[Amarna letter]], located in the [[British Museum]], no. 29851.

The letter contains only 16 lines of [[cuneiform]] text, in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], with lines 12 to 16 covering half of the tablet's reverse. Of note, the [[scribe]], though the tablet is unparagraphed, inscribed a line along the bottom of the front side below line 11; and likewise, at the start of the letter, a line is inscribed above the top of line 1, on the obverse. (See photo, Obverse: [http://fontes.lstc.edu/~rklein/images/amarna.jpg])

Letter EA 282 is from [[Šuwardata]], of Qiltu (typical in the Amarna letters: the "Man-([[LÚ (man Sumerogram)|LÚ]]), [[URU (city Sumerogram)|URU]]-Qiltu-([[ki (cuneiform)|ki]]), the "Govern-or" or 'Man of the (URU)-City-(his)'), to the Pharaoh of Egypt, and is from one of the vassal states in Canaan. Visually, the tablet is ovate, with even the inscribed cuneiform signs having ovate form, almost over the entire letter. Consequently, though EA 282 is topical, and tells a story, its first appearance is more like a piece of art, rather than a "diplomatic letter" (correspondence). The identified older photo (pictured), also shows an art-like appearance. Most Amarna letters are much more standard, and like a text, though the many styles of letters, as well as clay-types, leads to dramatic differences in Amarna letter's visual appearances.

The [[Amarna letters]], about 300, numbered up to EA 382, are a mid 14th century BC, about [[1350 BC]] and 20 years later, [[Text corpus|correspondence]]. The initial corpus of letters were found at [[Akhenaten]]'s city Akhetaten, in the floor of the [[Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh]]; others were later found, adding to the body of letters.

==The letter==

===Notes on the EA 282===
Typically an Amarna letter states the individual addressee (PN, personal name), addressor (PN), and the town/region they are from. Qiltu, the city/region of Šuwardata is not mentioned. In formulaic introductions, EA 282 has a very short formula, (with the addition of "over-flowing", "7 and 7 (times) over-flowing", rare in the Amarna letters). A number of letters also use the "on the front, and on the back", making this letter 2 extra lines in length. Otherwise, EA 282 is approximately the shortest letter possible, stating: Persons, formulaic introduction, statement of position, and need for continued Archer-troop aid/Pharaonic support.

'''''American Speech''''' is a quarterly [[academic journal]] of the [[American Dialect Society]], established in 1925 and published by  [[Duke University Press]]. It focuses primarily on the [[English language]] used in the [[Western Hemisphere]], but also publishes contributions on other varieties of English, outside influences on the language, and [[linguistics|linguistic]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dukeupress.edu/americanspeech/ American Speech], [[Duke University Press]]. Accessed February 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current editor is Thomas Purnell ([[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]).

The  ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education|Chronicle of Higher Education]]'s Lingua Franca''  consideres it a  "consistently reliable peer-reviewed source of information" and states that  "though it is scholarly and research based, there’s a surprising amount of information that is intelligible to anyone, even without special training in linguistics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Metcalfe|first=Allan|date=September 4, 2018|title=How Americans speak: the facts|url=https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2018/09/04/how-americans-speak-the-facts/?cid=at&amp;utm_source=at&amp;utm_medium=en&amp;elqTrackId=8f1c7f732345492d9c8c9efd312f5d21&amp;elq=5774dde3454448189264e4264e87f4a6&amp;elqaid=20379&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=9559|journal=Chronicle of Higher Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The journal was established in 1925 by [[Kemp Malone]], [[Louise Pound]], and [[Arthur G. Kennedy]] "to present information about English in America in a form appealing to general readers", and was inspired by [[H. L. Mencken]]. It became the official journal of the American Dialect Society in 1970.

'''Bookberry''' (Букбери) is a chain of [[bookstores]] based in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], and with stores in that city and in [[Yekaterinburg]]. 

The chain was launched by private investors in 2003, with 36% of its shares owned by [[Alexander Mamut]] (also a shareholder in [[Ingosstrah]], and [[Corbina Telecom]], a [[Golden Telecom]] subsidiary); a further percentage split equally between [[Roman Lola]], [[Dmitry Kushaev]] and [[Maxim Scherbakov]], and the rest by [[Waterstone’s]] founder, [[Tim Waterstone]].

In February 2008, a company controlled by [[Oleg Deripaska]], Rainko, bought a controlling stake, buying out Lola, Kushaev and Scherbakov entirely.  

By late 2008, the chain comprised 13 stores (up from 10 in late 2005), located in large [[shopping malls]] and on a number of major streets.  The CEO departed in January 2009, and by March 2009, five stores were closed, including the last-opened, on Tverskaya Street. 

On Monday 2 March 2009, the company applied for bankruptcy protection.&lt;ref&gt;Moscow Times, Moscow: 3 March 2009, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Infobox animanga/Footer}}
{{nihongo|'''''D.Gray-man'''''|ディー・グレイマン|Dī Gureiman|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Katsura Hoshino]]. Set in the 19th century, it tells the story of a young [[Allen Walker]], who joins an organization of [[exorcist]]s named the Black Order. They use an ancient substance, Innocence, to combat a man known as the [[Millennium Earl]] and his demonic army of Akuma who intend to destroy humanity. Many characters are adapted from Hoshino's previous works and drafts, such as ''Zone''. The series is noted for its dark narrative; Hoshino once rewrote a scene she thought too violent for her young readers.

The manga began serialization in 2004 in the ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' magazine, published by [[Shueisha]]. Production of the series was suspended several times because of Hoshino's health. ''D.Gray-man'' made the transition from a weekly to a monthly series in November 2009, when it began serialization in ''[[Jump Square]]''. On December 29, 2012, the series went on indefinite hiatus. It resumed serialization on July 17, 2015 after the release of ''[[Jump Square#Jump SQ.Crown|Jump SQ.Crown]]'', a spin-off from the magazine ''Jump SQ''. The manga's chapters have been collected in twenty-five ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes. By August 5, 2014, [[Viz Media]] had released 25 volumes in the United States.

A spin-off [[light novel|novel]] series, ''D.Gray-man Reverse'' by Kaya Kizaki, explores the history of a number of characters. The manga has been adapted into a 103-episode [[anime]] series by [[TMS Entertainment]] which aired from October 2006 to September 2008 in Japan and is licensed by [[Funimation]] in North America. A 13-episode anime series, ''D.Gray-Man Hallow'', was produced by TMS Entertainment. It aired in Japan from July to September 2016 as a sequel to the first ''D.Gray-man'' anime series. Several items of merchandise have been produced, including two video games about the series.

The manga has become one of Shueisha's bestsellers, with over 22.5 million copies sold. In Japan and North America, several individual volumes have appeared in weekly top-ten lists of bestselling manga. Although most reviewers found it similar to other series for the same demographic, they compared its moments of originality and well-developed characters favorably to other ''[[shōnen manga|shōnen]]'' series. Hoshino's artwork has received mostly positive reviews; most critics commented that her characters are visually appealing and that the gothic elements to the art is pleasant to look at, the only critic to criticize Hoshino's artwork stated that her fight sequences are difficult to follow.

==Synopsis==
{{see also|List of D.Gray-man characters}}

===Setting===
Set in an [[alternate history|alternate]] 19th century, the story focuses on an organization of exorcists, named the Black Order, as they defend humanity against the Noah Family, reincarnations of [[Noah]] and his twelve apostles whom bear hatred towards humanity and God led by a man known as the [[Millennium Earl]]. The exorcists' main weapon against the Noah Family are sentient holy artifacts called Innocence. Innocence comes in a variety of forms, varying from everyday objects such as boots to grandfather clocks, to weapons such as swords and guns; regardless of their form, each Innocence possesses unique offensive and supportive abilities and will only work for the wielder of their choosing. Out of the 109 Innocence hidden and scattered throughout the world, one of them is the [[Master/slave (technology)|master]] Innocence; whichever side obtains this Innocence first will win the war. In contrast to the Innocence, the Noah Family's weapons are derived from a power source known as Dark Matter. Dark Matter, grants the Noah [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]], along with the ability to create and control demons.

===Plot===
The central character is [[Allen Walker]], a new recruit to the Black Order who started training to control his Innocence after it destroyed the Akuma of his late guardian, Mana. The story begins in a [[villain of the week]] fashion, where Allen teams up with various members of the Black Order to search for Innocence while battling Noah's demons on the way. Later, Allen and his friends are ordered to track down exorcist General [[List of D.Gray-man characters#Cross Marian|Cross Marian]], Allen's missing teacher. Their search concludes with them stealing one of the Noah's transportation device, referred to as the [[Noah's Ark]]; this was made possible since Allen has been instilled the consciousness of [[List of D.Gray-man characters#Nea D. Campbell|Nea D. Campbell]], the exiled 14th member of the Noah Family who the Earl wishes to have back. During the Third Exorcists insurrection [[story arc]], Nea's consciousness begins superseding Allen's body. Now hunted by the Black Order, the Noah Family, and a humanoid Innocence called [[List of D.Gray-man characters#Apocryphos|Apocryphos]], Allen goes into hiding as he searches for a way to end Nea's resurrection.

==Production==
[[File:Katsura Hoshino Animagic Germany.JPG|thumb|130px|Manga author Katsura Hoshino incorporated several elements of her [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] title, ''Zone'', into ''D.Gray-man''.&lt;ref name="allen"/&gt;|alt=Serious-looking Japanese woman with short black hair|left]]
A draft of ''D.Gray-man'' was sent to Shueisha by manga author [[Katsura Hoshino]] on a nonspecified date. She had mixed feelings about writing the series, since she had been offered other jobs (such as developing video games). However, Shueisha liked the draft and the staff asked Hoshino to go ahead with the series believing it would be popular in 2004. She had originally intended to write a story about zombies, but was discouraged by her editor T-shi and decided to abandon the idea during the third chapter. Asked about her inspiration for writing about the [[supernatural]], Hoshino said that she feared it after seeing the 1973 film, ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''. Although the horror film frightened her, it inspired the author to design the manga's Akuma.&lt;ref name="ínter"&gt;{{cite book|title = D.Gray-man Official Fanbook: Gray Ark |date=June 4, 2008|last= Hoshino |first=Katsura |publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=191–235|isbn= 978-4-08-874248-9|language=Japanese| authorlink =Katsura Hoshino}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area in the series known as Noah's Ark was based on [[science fiction]] rather than the supernatural like the Akuma. After conceiving the Ark's role in the series, Hoshino decided to write a song when Allen is rebuilding it through a piano. She requested help from her editor, a university graduate, but decided to use her own lyrics. She blamed it on her own ego.&lt;ref name="ínter"/&gt;

Elements of ''D.Gray-man'' first appeared in Hoshino's [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] title, ''Zone'', in which the Akuma, the exorcists, and the Millennium Earl plan to end the world. Although Allen Walker is male, his character is based on ''Zone''{{'s}} female protagonist.&lt;ref name="allen"&gt;{{cite book |title= D.Gray-man, Volume 1 |year= 2006|last= Hoshino |first= Katsura |publisher= [[Viz Media]]|page=61|isbn= 1-4215-0623-8 | authorlink =Katsura Hoshino}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lavi (D.Gray-man)|Lavi]] is based on the protagonist of Hoshino's planned series, ''Book-man'', that she originally wanted to write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= D.Gray-man, Volume 4 |year= 2006|last= Hoshino |first= Katsura |publisher= [[Viz Media]]|isbn= 1-4215-0623-8  | authorlink =Katsura Hoshino}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other characters, such as the Millennium Earl, [[Lenalee Lee]], and [[List of D.Gray-man characters#Komui Lee|Komui Lee]], are based on real people whom Hoshino has not specifically identified; some are well-known scientists, and Komui is based on Hoshino's boss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= D.Gray-man, Volume 1 |year= 2006|last= Hoshino |first= Katsura |publisher= [[Viz Media]]|page=112|isbn= 1-4215-0623-8 | authorlink =Katsura Hoshino }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= D.Gray-man, Volume 2 |year= 2006|last= Hoshino |first= Katsura |publisher= [[Viz Media]]|page=172|isbn= 1-4215-0623-8  | authorlink =Katsura Hoshino}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= D.Gray-man, Volume 1 |year= 2006|last= Hoshino |first= Katsura |publisher= Viz Media|page=152|isbn= 1-4215-0623-8  | authorlink =Katsura Hoshino}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character of [[Yu Kanda]], based on a [[samurai]], was created to vary ''D.Gray-man''{{'}}s Western setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=D.Gray-man Official Fanbook: Gray Ark|last=Hoshino|first=Katsura|date=June 4, 2008|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|isbn=978-4-08-874248-9|page=208|language=Japanese | authorlink =Katsura Hoshino}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoshino found the design of some characters difficult early in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= D.Gray-man, Volume 1 |year= 2006|last= Hoshino |first= Katsura |publisher= [[Viz Media]]|page=112|isbn= 1-4215-0623-8  | authorlink =Katsura Hoshino}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= D.Gray-man, Volume 2 |year= 2006|last= Hoshino |first= Katsura |publisher= [[Viz Media]]|page=24|isbn= 1-4215-0623-8  | authorlink =Katsura Hoshino}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the author visited New York for research, and believed that the city had greatly influenced her work. Hoshino visited cemeteries, and was deeply impressed by her guides' comments at [[Ground zero]] of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] (left after the [[September 11 attacks]]). She said that she would like to spend more time in New York to gather data for the series.&lt;ref name="charagray"/&gt;

After beginning ''D.Gray-man'', Hoshino considered continuing to use the name ''Zone'' and also contemplated naming the series ''Dolls'' or ''Black Noah''. She chose "D.Gray-man" for its several meanings, most referring to the state of Allen and the other main characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= D.Gray-man, Volume 3 |year= 2006|last= Hoshino |first= Katsura |publisher= [[Viz Media]]|page=26|isbn= 1-4215-0625-4  | authorlink =Katsura Hoshino}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the title's meaning was not completely explained, Hoshino said that the "D" stands for "dear".&lt;ref name="inter"/&gt; According to the author, she got most of her ideas for the series while sleeping in her bathtub for six hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= D.Gray-man, Volume 3 |year= 2006|last= Hoshino |first= Katsura |publisher= [[Viz Media]]|page=81|isbn= 1-4215-0625-4  | authorlink =Katsura Hoshino}}&lt;/ref&gt; One exception was the second-volume plot, based on a [[Noh]] story entitled "Koi no Omoni".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= D.Gray-man, Volume 2 |year= 2006|last= Hoshino |first= Katsura |publisher= [[Viz Media]]|page=119|isbn= 1-4215-0624-6  | authorlink =Katsura Hoshino}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the manga moved from weekly to monthly serialization in 2009, Hoshino heard concerns from readers about its possible cancellation and reassured them that the series would continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= D.Gray-man, Volume 19 |year= 2010|last= Hoshino |first= Katsura |publisher= [[Viz Media]]|page=2|isbn=978-1-4215-3773-3 | authorlink =Katsura Hoshino}}&lt;/ref&gt; She set up Kanda's backstory by introducing the Third Exorcists, characters related to him and Alma Karma. In Hoshino's original drafts, Kanda's past had a number of [[plot hole]]s. A rewritten, published version had a young Kanda walking along a path surrounded by dead people who had cared for him. Due to its violence, the image was replaced with one in which Kanda learns that Alma Karma had killed them all. When the chapters were collected into a volume, Hoshino added a small chapter which included the corpses.&lt;ref name="charagray"/&gt;

When drawing the series, Hoshino entrusts her storyboards to her editor, which was initially complicated to her due to ''D.Gray-man'' being her first series. She faced difficulties with the initial weekly serialization of the manga resulted in multiple changes due to the how the storyboards changed across this period. Following Hoshino's change to a threemestral serialization, she uses digital from the storyboard stage. In bringing this style, she looked after manga author [[Tite Kubo]], famous for writing ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'', who uses a similar style. This allowed her to make more details to her illustrations and made character's faces more unique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=D.Gray-man 公式ファンブック 灰色ノ記録 (ジャンプコミックス)|last=Hoshino|first=Katsura|date=August 4, 2017|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|isbn=978-4088808482|pages=216-230|language=Japanese | authorlink =Katsura Hoshino|trans-title=D.Gray-man Official Fan Book -Gray Log- (Gray's Memory)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author noted that the character of Lavi was popular with fans, placing third in a poll (behind Allen and Kanda) despite infrequent appearances in later story arcs, and she promised that Lavi would return. The story arc involving Alma Karma, featuring several characters, was difficult for the author; as a result, the next arc in which Allen leaves the Black Order contained fewer characters per chapter due to its different format. The character of Apocryphos was introduced to hint at the Heart, a plot element briefly described in a past storyline which would later reappear.&lt;ref name="charagray"/&gt; Due to ''Jump Square''{{'s}} (the manga's magazine at the time) readership—older men, rather than children—Hoshino found Allen the most difficult character to write. She does not want Allen's problems in recent story arcs to lead to portraying him as a troubled teenager, preferring to show him as a cheerful person with a balance of strength and sorrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=CharaGray!|last=Hoshino|first=Katsura|date=July 4, 2011|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|isbn=978-4-08-870268-1|page=50|language=Japanese | authorlink =Katsura Hoshino}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''D.Gray-man''{{'s}} dark narrative, Hoshino plans to write more lighthearted series in the future.&lt;ref name="charagray"&gt;{{Cite book|title=CharaGray!|last=Hoshino|first=Katsura|year=2011|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|isbn=978-4-08-870268-1|pages=176–183|language=Japanese | authorlink =Katsura Hoshino}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Themes===
According to Hoshino, the series' main theme focuses on tragedy.&lt;ref name="charagray"/&gt; Many characters such as Allen across the series suffer poor fates such as losing a loved one and being tempted to revive them by the Earl. Although this works, the people are revived as Akuma who consume the skin of their loved ones. This has led to state that an initial theme is that people should not be brought back to life.&lt;ref name="cosplay"/&gt; Although some characters like Kanda express [[unconditional love]] to Alma, their happiness is short-lived due to Alma dying shortly after this with another writer finding fitting for the series' dark narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=D.Gray-man Hallow Episode 9|last=Lauenroth|first=Anne| url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/d.gray-man-hallow/episode-9/.105933| publisher=[[Anime News Network]]| access-date=August 30, 2016|date=August 30, 2016|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170313144149/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/d.gray-man-hallow/episode-9/.105933|archivedate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Allen's life becomes sadder across the series as he is forced to abandon the Black Order due to the [[Pope]] removing his rights as an exorcist and he is treated as Noah due to his connections with these characters. Nevertheless, Hoshino still tried to make it fun for the readers, stating that Allen will always have allies.&lt;ref name="charagray"/&gt; 

Another common theme of the series is the lack of black and white [[morality]]. Although Allen initially starts as a hero in the Black Order, their group are revealed to have created actions that might question the readers' thoughts in regards to whether or not the Order is good. Additionally, the Noah clan starts showing hidden depths despite their evil nature with the antagonistic Earl showing his care for the Noah Nea D. Campbell while Tyki Mikk questions Allen about whether or not the Exorcist should return to his "home" due the way hew has been treated as a result of being the Nea's vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/d.gray-man-hallow/episode-10/.106152|title=D.Gray-man Hallow Episode 10|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=February 16, 2017|date=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://manga.tokyo/anime-seasons/d-gray-man-hallow-episode-12-review/|title=D.Gray-man Hallow Episode 12 Review: My Home|publisher=Manga Tokyo|author=Karavasilis, Thanasis|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Representing Multiculturalism in Comics and Graphic Novels'' Carolene Ayaka states another theme set in the series is [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]]. This is reflected in Allen and the exorcists familiarizing themselves with their own supernatural powers in order to become more humanize themselves. On the other hand, Allen's revelation that he is the 14th Noah which makes him less human.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Representing Multiculturalism in Comics and Graphic Novels|last=Ayaka|first=Carolene|date=December 6, 2014|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1138025158|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theme is grief, as seen in the Millennium Earl's appearance as a tired, middle-aged man who is constantly searching for a former comrade, Nea. Hoshino believes that the Millennium Earl, the series' main antagonist, would fit the manga's demographic.&lt;ref name="earlhuman"&gt;{{Cite book|title=CharaGray!|last=Hoshino|first=Katsura|date=July 4, 2011|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|isbn=978-4-08-870268-1|page=187|language=Japanese | authorlink =Katsura Hoshino}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''Anime and Philosophy: Wide Eyed Wonder'' Josef Steiff and Tristan D. Tamplin discuss how ''D.Gray-man'', alongside ''[[Spriggan (manga)|Spriggan]]'' and ''[[Ulysses 31]]'', focus on the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|"end of the world"]] with ''D.Gray-man'' and ''Spriggan'' taking references from the [[Genesis flood narrative|blibical flood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anime and Philosophy: Wide Eyed Wonder|author=Tamplin, Tristan D.; Steiff, Joseff|publisher=[[Open Court]]|year=2010|isbn=978-0812696707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptation===
[[File:Toshiyuki Morikawa.jpg|thumb|Japanese voice actor [[Toshiyuki Morikawa]] noted that the staff got along well while making the ''D.Gray-man'' anime.&lt;ref name="Morikawa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2009-08-27/interview-toshiyuki-morkiawa-voice-of-d.gray-man-tyki-mikk|title=Interview: Toshiyuki Morikawa, voice of D.Gray-man's Tyki Mikk|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140421180437/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2009-08-27/interview-toshiyuki-morkiawa-voice-of-d.gray-man-tyki-mikk|accessdate=February 11, 2017|archivedate=April 21, 2014|author=Chang, Chih-Chieh|date=August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt= Standing Japanese man reading a book onstage at a microphone]]
During production of the first [[anime]] adaptation, the author often visited the TMS Entertainment studio, where the voice actors requested advice about their characters. Although Hoshino was nervous about talking with them, she was surprised by their dedication in practising their characters—particularly [[Sanae Kobayashi]] (Allen), [[Takahiro Sakurai]] (Kanda), [[Katsuyuki Konishi]] (Komui), and [[Hiroki Tōchi]] (Cross Marian)—and joked that Lenalee seemed more beautiful after she saw [[Shizuka Itō]]'s work. Early in production, Hoshino was shown an early version of the first opening theme: "[[Abingdon Boys School discography#Singles|Innocent Sorrow]]" by the [[Japanese rock|Japanese rock band]] [[Abingdon Boys School]]. When she saw the video, Hoshino began to cry in delight while the staff laughed to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= D.Gray-man, Volume 9 |year= 2008|last= Hoshino |first= Katsura |publisher= [[Viz Media]]|pages=186–189|isbn= 978-1-4215-1610-3 | authorlink =Katsura Hoshino}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of D.Gray-man characters#Tyki Mikk|Tyki Mikk]]'s voice actor, [[Toshiyuki Morikawa]], remembered the recording sessions for the series as "lively" because of the presence of many popular actors.

The anime's sequel was [[Subtitle (titling)|subtitled]] ''Hallow'', referring to [[Halloween]]; the holiday celebrates the "revival of the dead", and TMS Entertainment celebrated the "revival of the ''D.Gray-man'' anime series".&lt;ref name="inter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.nicovideo.jp/watch/lv259365426|title=『ジャンプSQ.CROWN』 2016 SPRING発売記念「D.Gray-man」&amp;「血界戦線 Back 2 Back」|publisher=Nicovideo|date=April 15, 2016| archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170215144602/http://live.nicovideo.jp/watch/lv259365426 | archivedate=February 15, 2017|trans-title="Jump SQ.CROWN" 2016 SPRING Release Memorial "D.Gray-man" &amp; "Blood Battlefront Back 2 Back"|accessdate=February 15, 2017|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is a sequel, Hoshino called it a completely new ''D.Gray-man'' anime and thanked fans for following it.

===Critical reception===
====Manga====
Reception of the series has been generally positive. In his review of volume one, Carlo Santos of [[Anime News Network]] said that certain plot points "come out of nowhere" and the story was kept from its full potential due to finding some points like the designs generic. However, he enjoyed the series' quick-moving plot, exposition, and backstory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Full Frontal Alchemy – Right Turn Only!!| url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/right-turn-only/2006-04-18|date=April 18, 2008 | publisher=[[Anime News Network]]| accessdate=August 12, 2008|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120630070213/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/right-turn-only/2006-04-18|archivedate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheena McNeil from Sequentialtart called it the best manga from 2006 based on its story and cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sequentialtart.com/reports.php?ID=4595&amp;issue=2006-05-01 |title=D.Gray-Man Vol. 1 |last=McNeil |first=Sheena |date=May 1, 2006 |publisher=Squentialtart.com |accessdate=July 24, 2009 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120630070201/http://www.sequentialtart.com/reports.php?ID=4595&amp;issue=2006-05-01 |archivedate=June 30, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A.E. Sparrow of [[IGN]] also reviewed the first volume, comparing the series' antagonist to three of ''[[Batman franchise media|Batman]]''{{'}}s villains due to his likeability despite his role.

Hoshino's art received mixed reviews. According to Casey Brienza of ANN, as of volume twelve, the battles were "practically unintelligible" yet liked the rest of the artwork. She described Hoshino's drawing style as the "aesthetic yet dynamic, superbly beautiful yet super-violent" style made famous by female manga artists arising from the late-1980s and early-1990s ''[[dōjinshi]]'' subculture, citing [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]] and [[Yun Kōga]] as examples. Brienza also talked about Hoshino's character designs, believing fans of both sexes would find them appealing.&lt;ref name="ANNVol12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/d.gray-man/gn-12|title=D.Gray-man GN 12 – Review|last=Brienza|first=Casey|date=March 14, 2009|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=March 16, 2009|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121206031256/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/d.gray-man/gn-12|archivedate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douresseaux called Hoshino's art "highly stylish" and  reminiscent of work by [[Joe Madureira]], [[Kelley Jones]], and [[Chris Bachalo]].&lt;ref name="ComicBookBinVol7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookbin.com/dgrayman007.html|title=D.Gray-Man: Volume 7|last=Douresseaux|first=Leroy|date=October 22, 2007|publisher=Coolstreak Cartoons|accessdate=March 16, 2009|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130102140310/http://www.comicbookbin.com/dgrayman007.html|archivedate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ComicBookBinVol11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookbin.com/dgrayman011.html|title=D.Gray-Man: Volume 11|last=Douresseaux|first=Leroy|date=November 22, 2008|publisher=Coolstreak Cartoons|accessdate=March 16, 2009|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130102062523/http://www.comicbookbin.com/dgrayman011.html|archivedate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing her backgrounds as eerie and [[Lovecraftian]], Douresseaux wrote that Hoshino made appealing scenes that combined both gothic and violent elements.&lt;ref name="ComicBookBinVol7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ComicBookBinVol11"/&gt; Brian Henson criticized changes made to the Viz Media version, such as the replacement of Japanese sound effects with less-appealing ones and awkward translations of character names.&lt;ref name="mania"/&gt;

According to Funimation Entertainment president and CEO [[Gen Fukunaga]], the anime series was popular in Japan and the United States.&lt;ref name="funimation"/&gt; Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network reviewed the first episode, calling it derivative with "absolutely nothing original" but not boring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Fall Anime Preview Guide| url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2006-10-22| publisher=[[Anime News Network]]| accessdate=August 29, 2008|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120718073325/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2006-10-22|archivedate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that Allen's use of the anti-Akuma weapon might seem [[cliché]]d, Todd Douglass Jr. of [[DVD Talk]] found its use in the anime entertaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= D.

{{Transitivity and Valency}}

In [[linguistics]], '''dative shift''' is a pattern in which the [[subcategorization]] of a [[verb]] can take on two alternating forms. In the oblique dative (OD) form, the verb takes a [[noun phrase]] (NP) and a [[prepositional phrase]] (PP), the second of which is not a core [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]].

:John '''gave''' [&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt; a book] [&lt;sub&gt;PP&lt;/sub&gt; to Mary].

In the double object construction (DOC) form the verb takes two noun phrases, both of which are core [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]].

:John '''gave''' [&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt; Mary] [&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt; a book].

==Synonyms used in the literature==

Terms used in literature on dative shift can vary. The chart below provides terms used in this article in bold, along with other common [[synonym]]s used elsewhere :

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Double object construction !! Oblique dative !! Dative alternations
|-
| Dative shift || Simple dative || Dative construction
|-
| VP complementation structures || Dative complement construction || Dative transformation
|-
|}

== Distribution ==

[[Traditional grammar]] suggests (as a “rule of thumb”) that only single-[[syllable]] verbs can be in double object construction (DOC).{{refn|name=Payne|Payne, Thomas (2011). Understanding English Grammar. pp. 322–323.}}

:(3) a. [John] '''bought''' [Mary] [a cake]
:b. [John] '''bought''' [a cake] [for Mary]

:(4) a. *[John] '''acquired''' [Mary] [a new car]
:b. [John] '''acquired''' [a new car] [for Mary]

These verbs must have the [[Theta role|theta-role]] of [[Thematic relation|recipient]]/[[Thematic relation|goal]]/[[Thematic relation|beneficiary]] in their theta grid when in DOC form. A theta grid is where theta roles are stored for a particular verb (see Section 2 on the [[theta role]] page). In example (5), the DOC form is not permitted, despite the verb root being single syllable, because '' wash '' lacks the theta-role of recipient. One explanation for why the verb lacks this theta-role is that there is no [[possessive]] relationship between the direct object and the indirect object).&lt;ref name=Payne /&gt;

:(5) a. *[John] '''washed''' [Mary] [the dishes]
:b. [John] '''washed''' [the dishes][for Mary]

One lexical theory suggests the reason for this lies with the origin of the verbs that allow [[Dative case|dative]] form. Generally, native verbs (Anglo-Saxon) allow dative form, whereas Latinate verbs do not. This is thought to be primarily due to the stress associated with native verbs, rather than [[Etymology|etymological]] conditions.

An additional [[Semantics|semantic]] component constrains some native verbs further. The double object construction requires a [[possession (linguistics)|possessor/possessed]] relationship. This means the indirect object in the oblique dative construction must have the theta-role of beneficiary (PP introduced by "for") or recipient/goal (PP introduced by "to") to be a candidate for the dative [[Alternation (linguistics)|alternation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mazurkewich|first=Irene|author2=White|title=The acquisition of the dative alternation: Unlearning overgeneralizations|journal=Cognition|year=1984|volume=16|pages=261–283|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(84)90030-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This theory suggests verbs chosen for double-object form are done so before syntactic processes take place. The knowledge of the relationship of possession/possessed (semantic constraint) is learned prior to the class constraint of the verbs (native vs. latinate).

==Analyses==

===Chomsky 1955===

[[Noam Chomsky]], in ''The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory'' (1955, 1975) provides a proposal about dative structure using [[transformational grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|title=The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory|year=1975|location=New York|isbn=0-306-30760-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky's argument suggests that a simple dative like ''John sent a letter to Mary'' derives from an [[Underlying representation|underlying form]].&lt;ref name=Larson&gt;Larson, Richard K. (1988). "On the Double Object Construction". ''Linguistic Inquiry. Summer'' '''19''' (3).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|335}}

In this simple dative sentence ''John sent a letter to Mary'', the verb, ''sent'', and its indirect object, ''to Mary'', make up a [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] that excludes the direct object ''a letter''. 
The simple dative therefore involves an underlying verb phrase (VP) whose subject is ''a letter'' and whose object is ''(to) Mary''. 
The VP ''sent to Mary'' is referred to as an inner [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituent]]. 
This inner constituent is obscured as [[Transformational grammar|S-Structure]] by V Raising&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;{{rp|335}}

'''Dative complementation''':

Examples (6) and (7) show dative complementation before V raising (6) and after V raising (7):

:(6) John [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; a letter [&lt;sub&gt;V'&lt;/sub&gt; send to Mary]] (D-Structure)

:(7) John send [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; a letter [&lt;sub&gt;V'&lt;/sub&gt; t to Mary]] (S-Structure)

===Kayne 1983===

In his book, Connectedness and Binary Branching,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kayne|first=Richard S.|title=Connectedness and Binary Branching|year=1983|pages=193–196|publisher=Foris Publications|location=U.S.A|isbn=90-6765-028-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Kayne]] proposed an empty [[preposition]] being the source of the double-object construction. In his analysis, English prepositions have the ability to assign objective [[Grammatical case|case]]. Kayne argued an empty preposition was responsible for allowing a double object construction.

:(8) V [&lt;sub&gt;PP&lt;/sub&gt; P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; NP]NP

He continued with the notion that an [[empty category|empty preposition]] (P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;)cannot be the source of [[Case role|case]], and inferred that instead the empty preposition could transfer the Case assigned by the verb. He further stipulated Case may only be transferred via prepositions that normally assign [[object case]]. Therefore, languages that do not assign object case via prepositions (such as [[French Grammar|French]]) cannot take the double-object form.

===Barss and Lasnik 1986===

In their 1986 paper "A Note on Anaphora and Double Objects," Barss and Lasnik point out a number of asymmetries in the behavior of the two NPs in double object construction. All of their findings point to the same conclusion: in constructions involving a verb phrase of  the form V-NP-NP, the first NP [[c-command]]s the second, but not vice versa. 
Specifically, NP1 can [[Binding (linguistics)|bind]] NP2, but the opposite cannot occur.&lt;ref name=Barss&gt;Barss, A; Lasnik (1986). "A Note on Anaphora and Double Objects". ''Linguistic Inquiry'' '''17'''&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|347–54}} The paper provides significant evidence for rejecting linear [[Phrase structure grammar|phrase structure]] trees (Figure 1).&lt;ref name=Barss/&gt;{{rp|347}}

===Larson 1988===

Larson proposes that both the oblique dative form and the double object construction are surface representations. He relates the oblique dative and double object structures [[Transformational grammar|transformationally]].&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;{{rp|350}}

====Oblique datives====

To account for oblique datives, Larson adopts a proposal originally made by Chomsky (1955/1975), where the [[deep structure]] of the dative VP is raised in the surface structure. See Figure 2.

:(9) &lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt;[&lt;sub&gt;V'&lt;/sub&gt;[&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; ''e''][&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt;[&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt; a letter][&lt;sub&gt;V'&lt;/sub&gt;[&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; send [&lt;sub&gt;PP&lt;/sub&gt; to Mary]]]]

[[File:Underlying Structure of a Simple Dative.jpg|thumb|Fig. 2 Larson's underlying structure of a simple dative&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;{{rp|342}}]]

[[File:V-Raising of a Simple Dative according to Larson.jpg|thumb|Fig. 3 The V-raising of a simple dative according to Larson&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;{{rp|343}}]]
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Deep structure of VP:&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;{{rp|342}}

|-
| VP complement: ''a letter send to Mary''
|-
| The specifier: ''a letter''
|-
| Head: ''send''
|-
| PP complement: ''to Mary''
|}

The correct ordering of the oblique dative surfaces through [[Syntactic movement|head to head movement]]. See Figure 3. The verb ''send'' moves to the empty V position. The verb, ''give'', has two thematic roles that are assigned to the internal arguments: theme: ''a letter'' and goal: ''to Mary.'' &lt;ref name=Larson /&gt;{{rp|340}} The movement leaves a [[Trace (linguistics)|trace]] at the original V and creates a sequence of [[Binding (linguistics)|coindexed]] V positions.&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;{{rp|343}} Raising is attributed to Case and Inflectional Agreement.&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;{{rp|343}}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Before raising !! After raising
|-
| V is not the head of a projection governed by Inflection || The head of topmost VP, V is governed by Inflection
|-
| NP is not governed by the verb and cannot receive Case || The verb can assign objective case to the NP
|}

Larson's motivations for V'Raising are the same motivations used to derive the surface order of raising in VSO languages, such as Irish. Specifically, the subject NP can receive case from the V, when V [[Government (linguistics)|governs]] the NP.

Citing Chomsky (1975, 55) in the process, Larson provides an intuitive explanation of oblique datives, "''to Mary'' forms the small predicate ''sent-to-Mary.'' This small [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] is predicated of an "inner subject" ''a letter,'' forming a clauselike VP: ''a letter send to Mary'' &lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;{{rp|342}}

====Double object construction====
[[File:Larson (88) Account of Dative Shift.jpg|thumb|Fig 4: Larson's 1988 account of dative shift&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;{{rp|353}}]]
Larson states that double object constructions can be syntactically derived by a modern form of dative shift.&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;{{rp|335}} He argues that properties of the double object construction structured can be explained under a derivational approach.&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;{{rp|350}} and describes his challenge as one where he must bring the dative shift derivation within the scope of established theoretical principles and constrain it in appropriate ways.&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;{{rp|351}}

First, Larson strengthens the argument that the two NPs as in Figure 2 relate to subject and object position. He states that the [[Government (linguistics)|governed]] preposition ''to'' has the status of [[Dative case|dative]] [[Case role|case marking]].&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;{{rp|351}} This is similar to case marking appearing on indirect object in more highly [[Inflection|inflected]] languages.&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;{{rp|351}}
&lt;br /&gt;
Second, Larson extends operations that apply between subjects and objects to structures such as that in Figure 2.&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;{{rp|351}}
Specifically, he looks at [[Passive voice|passive]] formation in the inner VP.&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;{{rp|351}}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Two main effects of passive derivation
|-
| Withdrawal of case from object position
|-
| Suppression of thematic role assignment in subject position
|}

These two effects trigger NP Movement to subject position and the subject [[theta role]] is realized by an [[Adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]] phrase. 
&lt;br /&gt;
Larson makes one amendment to the derivation of passives called Argument Demotion, which proposes that subject theta-role is assigned in an adjunct configuration.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Argument demotion''': If &lt;big&gt;α&lt;/big&gt; is a &lt;big&gt;ɵ&lt;/big&gt;-role assigned by X&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;, then &lt;big&gt;α&lt;/big&gt; may be assigned (up to optionality) to an adjunct of X&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;{{rp|352}}
|}

With this amended view of passive formation, Larson derives the double object construction surface representation. 
Passive absorbs the Case assigned to the indirect object, resulting in ''to'' being absorbed. The theta role assigned to the subject of VP undergoes demotion, reducing the position to nonthematic status. The direct object receives its theta-role from V' and under Argument Demotion this theta role must be assigned to a V' adjunct. The direct object is realized as a V' adjunct.&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;{{rp|352}}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Deep structure !! Surface structure
|-
| Indirect object is caseless in its deep position || Indirect object undergoes NP movement to VP subject position
|-
| VP subject position is nonthematic and empty || Verb raises to V-head position, assigning Case to VP subject
|}&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;{{rp|351}}

Larson gives this passive operation the name "dative shift" – where NP movement promotes an argument to VP subject,&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt;{{rp|352}} as seen in Figure 4.

===Contemporary theories===
At present, there are two major classes of analyses for Dative Shift; these two classes have been called the Uniform Multiple Meaning approach (Levin, 2008) and the Single Meaning Approach (Hovav &amp; Levin, 2008), with the former being considered the dominant approach.

====Uniform multiple meaning approach====
In most variants of the Uniform Multiple Meaning approach (Beck &amp; Johnson 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beck &amp; Johnson|title=Double Objects Again|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|year=2004|volume=Winter|issue=35|pages=97–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harley 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harley|first=H.|title=Possession and the Double Object Construction|journal=Linguistic Variation Yearbook|year=2003|volume=2|pages=31–70|doi=10.1075/livy.2.04har}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinker 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pinker|first=Steven|title=The Learnability and Acquisition of the Dative Alternation in English|journal=Language|date=June 1989|volume=65|issue=2|pages=203–257|doi=10.2307/415332}}&lt;/ref&gt; ),  it is assumed that the relationship between the Double Object Construction and the Oblique Dative forms is non-derivational. That is to say that the alternation arises not purely from syntactic factors, but from semantic ones as well: each variation is associated with its own meaning, and hence, each meaning has its own realization of arguments. This shows a clear departure from some of the main beliefs in Larson’s 1988 analysis.

In most realizations of this approach, the Oblique Dative form expresses caused motion (Goldberg, 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldberg|first=Adele|title=Constructions: A Construction Grammar Approach to Argument Structure|year=1995|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) while the Double Object variant expresses caused possession. This can be summarized in the following table:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Oblique dative !! Double object construction
|-
| caused motion || caused possession
|}

====Single meaning approach====
Contemporary theories taking the Single Meaning approach continue to consider Dative Shift with the assertion Larson’s 1988 analysis makes: that the Double Object Construction and Oblique Dative variants are associated with the same semantic meaning, but surface differently due to different argument realizations (Hovav &amp; Levin, 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoavav &amp; Levin|title=The English dative alternation: The case for verb sensitivity|year=2008|volume=44|pages=129–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; ). Variants of this approach include Jackendoff’s (1990),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jackendoff|first=R.|title=On Larson's Analysis of the Double Object Construction|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|year=1990|volume=21|pages=427–456}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he provides different analyses for verbs with different types of meaning (e.g. “give” and “sell” vs “throw” and “kick”). This approach - also taken by Hovav and Levin (2008) - is also known as the Verb-Sensitive Approach.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Type of verb !! Oblique dative !! Double object construction
|-
| give-type verbs || caused possession || caused possession
|-
| throw-type verbs || caused motion or caused possession || caused possession
|}

==Child language acquisition==

===General notes===
Findings have shown&lt;ref name=Conwell&gt;Conwell, Erin; Demuth (May 2007). "Early Syntactic productivity: Evidence from dative shift". ''Elsevier'' '''103''' (2): 163–179.&lt;/ref&gt; that by age three children demonstrate an understanding of dative shift alternation. When presented with both alternations using novel [[verbs]], children are more likely to shift the DOC form into the oblique dative form.  
For example, children were presented with novel verbs in both the double object construction and oblique dative forms:

:(8) "You pilked Petey the cup" (DOC)

:(9) "You gorped the keys to Toby" (oblique dative)

After hearing these two forms and then being asked to produce a corresponding alternation for one of the two, children were more likely to produce the oblique dative (10) than the double object construction (11).

:(10) "I pilked the cup to Petey" (oblique dative)

:(11) "I gorped Toby the keys" (DOC).
:&lt;ref name=Conwell/&gt;

===Baker's Paradox and original hypotheses===

Although DOC and oblique dative forms are common productions for children at age three, the dative shift poses a paradox for young children learning English. The paradox, termed "Baker's Paradox", can be summarized in the following examples.

When children hear both forms:

:(12) a. Give money to him (oblique dative form)
:b. Give him money (DOC);

Children may formulate a [[lexical rule]], deriving the double object form from the oblique dative form. However, the rule would permit the following example of overgeneralization:

:(13) a. Donate money to him.
:b. *Donate him money.

Example (13)b is an overgeneralization because they apply dative shift to the verb "donate", whereas in fact "donate" cannot undergo dative shift.&lt;ref name=Gropen&gt;Gropen, J; Wilson (1989). "The Learnability and Acquisition of the Dative Alternation in English". ''Language'' '''65''': 204.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|204}}

When children say ungrammatical sentences, they are not often corrected. How, then, do children avoid overgeneralizations such as the one above? There are 2 main hypotheses which try and explain how children avoid overgeneralizations:

'''The "conservatism" hypothesis''':

This hypothesis proposes that children do not overgeneralize the double object construction to verbs such as ''"donate"'' and ''"whisper"'' (ex. "John whispers Mary the secret"), because the child never hears ungrammatical double-object forms in their input. The child only recreates forms they hear in their input and does not generalize.&lt;ref name=Gropen /&gt;{{rp|204–205}}

'''The "criteria" hypothesis''':

This hypothesis proposes that children learn to constrain their rule for dative shift and are able to apply it only to monosyllabic verbs (one-syllable verbs, ex. ''"give"''), which indicate possession changes (ex. "Mary gave John the ball", where "give" denotes a possession change from Mary, to John). In other words, children are quite productive with their speech, applying dative shift to many verbs, but are constrained by [[morphophonological]] criteria ([[monosyllabic]] vs. [[polysyllabic]] verbs), and [[semantic]] criteria (possession change).&lt;ref name=Gropen /&gt;{{rp|205}}

===The data===

Gropen et al."s 1989 studies&lt;ref name=Gropen /&gt;{{rp|238}} investigated these two hypotheses. According to these theorists, a strict "conservatism hypothesis" is false. Children in their studies did not only use the double-object construction with [[verbs]] they had heard in that alternation. However, the theorists proposed that a weaker version of the conservatism hypothesis is true, because children used verbs more often than not in the alternation they had heard them used in. In regard to the "criteria hypothesis", evidence shows that children do indeed have criteria-governed productivity, but only in a very general way.

===New hypothesis===

A new hypothesis was proposed to account for everything the original hypotheses couldn't (Gropen et al., 1989).&lt;ref name=Gropen /&gt;{{rp|203–257}}  This hypothesis is a mixture of the "weak" conservatism hypothesis, the criteria hypothesis, and lexical information. The main idea presented is that speakers acquire a "dative rule" that operates on two levels: the "broad range" and the "narrow range" levels.

====Broad-range level====

On the "broad-range level" the rule applies [[semantically]] and lexically, or "lexicosemantically". In this account, the [[syntactic]] change and [[semantic]] constraints of the dative rule are consequences of a single operation, namely the lexicosemantic shift. 
[[File:Gropen and Pinker Dative Shift Flowchart.pdf|600px|thumbnail|Fig 5. Gropen et al.'s "broad-range" level alternation process &lt;ref name=Gropen /&gt;{{rp|242}}]]
That is, if a verb beginning in the "X causes Y to go to Z" structure can alternate with the "X causes Z to have Y" structure and the sentence remains well-formed, then the child realizes that this verb can undergo dative shift.  
Figure 5, to the right, illustrates the alternation process.

Verbs that undergo the "dative shift" rule must also be specified by a [[Possession (linguistics)|possessor-possession]] relationship. Verbs whose meanings are not cognitively compatible with the notion of a possession change will not produce a coherent semantic structure in the double object construction.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Example DOC!! Alternating form!! Reasons for DOC ill/well-formedness 
|-
| '' '''*''' I drove Chicago the car.'' || ''I drove the car to Chicago.''|| ill-formed: the verb ''"drive"'' requires a semantic structure
corresponding to 'causing Chicago to possess the car',which is nonsense if only people can be possessors.  
|-
| '' '''*''' I drove Mary the car.'' ||''I drove the car for Mary.'' || ill-formed: the verb ''"drive"'' is not compatible with &lt;br /&gt;
the notion of causing to possess
|-
| ''I bought Mary the car.'' || ''I bought the car for Mary.'' ||well-formed: ''"buying"'' is a form of causing to possess. 
|}

The constraints characterized by this broad-range level form as a combination of children"s [[Lexical (semiotics)|lexical]], [[semantic]], and [[syntactic]] structural innate knowledge, and the frequency of these forms in their input.&lt;ref name=Gropen /&gt;{{rp|240–242}}

====Narrow-range level====
On the "narrow-range level" the dative rule constricts the broad-level rule, allowing it only to apply to subclasses of semantically and morphologically similar verbs. Narrow-range rules could be acquired by a procedure that is weakly conservative, in that the only verbs that the child allows to undergo the dative shift freely are those verbs that they have actually heard undergo an alternation, or verbs that are semantically similar to them. The narrow subclasses of verbs are simply the set of verbs that are similar to a verb the child has heard to alternate. ‘Semantic similarity" would be defined as verbs that share most or all of their grammatically-relevant semantic structure (ex. the notions of ''"go", "be", "have"'', or ''"act"'', and kinds of causal relations such as ''"cause", "let", and "prevent"'', including the verbs ''"throw" and "kick"'', which share the same general semantic structure of "cause").&lt;ref name=Gropen /&gt;{{rp|244–246}}

'''Morphophonological constraint'''

The final constraint of this proposed hypothesis is the [[morphophonological]] constraint. It is proposed that children will apply the morphological constraint to subclasses of alternating verbs that are ''all'' from the native class (monosyllabic). If the set of alternating verbs are not all from the native class, then the child will ''not'' apply the morphophonological constraint. This account correctly predicts that the morphophonological constraint could apply to some semantic subclasses, but not others. For example, children would apply the constraint to the following five subclasses of alternating verbs:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Verb subclass !! Grammatical example !! Ungrammatical example
|-
| 1. giving || John gave Mary the book. || *John donated/contributed Mary the book.
|-
|2. communication || John told Mary the news. || *John explained/announced/reported Mary the news.
|-
|3. creation || John baked Mary a cake. || *John constructed/designed/created Mary a cake.
|-
|4. sending || John shipped Mary a parcel. || *John transported Mary a parcel.
|-
|5. obtaining || John bought Mary some food. || *John obtained/collected Mary some food.
|}

Children would not apply the constraint to the class of "future having" verbs because they are not all from the native (monosyllabic) class, thereby allowing the following DOC examples to be well-formed:

:(14) John ''assigned/allotted/guaranteed/bequeathed'' Mary four tickets.
:&lt;ref name=Gropen /&gt;{{rp|247–249}}

A '''deathtrap''' is a [[literary]] and [[drama]]tic [[plot device]] in which a [[villain]] who has captured the [[hero]] or another sympathetic character attempts to use an elaborate, improbable, and usually sadistic method of [[murder]]ing them.

It is often used as a means to create dramatic tension in the story and to have the villain reveal important information to the hero, confident that the hero will shortly not be able to use it. It may also be a means to show the hero's resourcefulness in escaping, or the writer's ingenuity at devising a last-minute rescue or [[deus ex machina]].

== History ==
This plot device is generally believed to have been popularized by [[Serial film|movie serials]] and 19th-century theatrical [[melodrama]]s. A well-known example is the [[cliché]] of the moustache-twirling villain leaving the heroine tied to railroad tracks. Its use in the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] film series and [[superhero]] stories is well known.

== Narrative use ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}It is a common criticism that it is unbelievable in story plots to have villains try to kill the heroes in such elaborate ways when they could use simple methods like shooting them. Through the decades, [[comic book]] writers have responded to these complaints by devising ways in which the deathtraps have served other purposes.

For instance, one ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' story by [[Jim Shooter]] had a team of Legionnaires put into a variety of deathtraps and the villains ''wanted'' the heroes to successfully escape. This was because the real purpose of the deathtraps was to have the Legionnaires use a great deal of energy doing so, which the villains then harnessed for their own benefit. Other stories have had villains use deathtraps as a means of testing the heroes or to distract them while the villain attends to other matters. On some occasions, the deathtrap is a machine that "absorbs" the energy from the hero/heroes.

Another rationalization for a deathtrap is when a particular villain simply enjoys leaving his victims some small chance of survival, just for the sake of sport. Such "sporting" villains include [[Riddler|the Riddler]], who has an uncontrollable compulsion to create intellectual challenges for his enemies. Also included in this list is the [[Jigsaw Killer]], who places his victims in life-or-death situations to prove that they appreciate life. [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] and [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] are other villains who simply enjoy the challenge.

On occasion, the villain may employ a slow deathtrap because they enjoy their victim's suffering prior to death, either due to sadistic tendencies or a desire for painful vengeance.

In a similar vein, the villain, often a [[megalomania]]c, may feel that, as a reflection of his own imagined greatness, it would be "beneath him" to murder his enemy like any common criminal, and that his enemy's death should be the worthy spectacle that a successful deathtrap would provide. In contrast, he may feel that his enemy, having provided him with a worthy challenge in their earlier encounters, himself "deserves" such a grandiose death, or that the enmity between the two is so "epic" that it merits no less than such a conclusion.

Conversely, the protagonists' act of falling into such a trap may itself be the reason they are written off and left unattended. The villain, disappointed in such a non-threatening opponent, loses interest, and intentionally leaves some chance of escape for the protagonists to "redeem" themselves. However, the disillusioned villain tends to assume that the chance is minuscule. Despite secretly hoping that the opponent survives and proves worthy of interest, the now-bored villain is invariably shocked when that actually occurs.

If fully serious, the villain may simply be too insane to recognize the impracticality of the situation, although this characterization is rarely seen outside of deliberately parodic characters such as [[Dr. Evil]].

A more recent reason is villains do it simply because it is considered 'tradition' or 'rule' of being a supervillain to place a hero in a deathtrap and then leave them to their fate. This even goes as far as heroes, or other villains, insulting a villain for attempting to avoid using a deathtrap or staying to watch. [[Batmen of All Nations#Club of Villains|El Sombrero]] is one villain who exemplifies this reason.

When a hero's sidekick or loved one is placed in a deathtrap, its purpose is often to distract the hero, occupying time and attention while the villain pursues their evil plan. Less frequently, the villain intends to instill grief and guilt as a means of defeating a hero that cannot be defeated physically. Multiple secondary characters may be placed in deathtraps to offer the hero an agonizing choice, ostensibly forcing the hero to save one victim and leave the other(s) to die.

== Famous examples ==
*''[[The Engineer's Thumb]]'' ([[Sherlock Holmes]] story): the  engineer Victor Hatherley is trapped inside a hydraulic press which would crush him to a pulp 
**Escape method: a woman working for the villains but not sharing their criminal ruthlessness opens a side panel at the last moment, allowing Hatherley to escape
*''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'': Sealing [[Indiana Jones]] and Marion in the Well of Souls
**Escape method: Seeing a possible tunnel entrance, Jones climbed a statue and toppled it towards the wall to create an entrance to a passageway that led to the outside.
*''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'': Doctor Kananga and a minion tie James Bond and Solitare to a platform to be lowered into a shark infested pool to be eaten alive.
**Escape method: Without the villains seeing, Bond activates his watch's [[rotary saw]] function to cut through his restraints to free himself and attack Kananga.
*''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]'': James Bond is shackled spreadeagled to a table and a [[circular saw]] (a [[laser]] in the [[Goldfinger (film)|film]]) is approaching to cut him in half. Unlike many deathtrap scenarios, Bond remains under constant supervision, and he does not use (or have) a device or outside help to escape.
**Escape method: Bond bluffs Goldfinger, and persuades him that his replacement "008" also knows about Goldfinger's plans and that Bond's death will immediately summon him to investigate, so Goldfinger elects to not take the chance of another spy coming on the scene to interfere, which he can avoid by holding Bond captive.
*[[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]": The unnamed character finds himself bound to a large slab, beneath a bladed pendulum that slowly lowers toward him as it swings, with the intention of slicing through his chest.
**Escape method: The character lures mice to the ropes with a piece of meat. They chew through the ropes, allowing him to escape before the pendulum can slice him open.
* In the ''Dudley Do-Right'' cartoon, villain Snidely Whiplash (a parody of the stereotypical "movie-serial" villain) tied up Nell Fenwick on a table-saw conveyor belt.  The narrator (Paul Frees) noted that, "Fortunately, the belt was in need of oiling, so the trip was a slow one."  In elapsed time, through the course of the story, this actually took several hours.
*The 1960s live action [[television program|television series]] ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' usually had two-part episodes use a bizarre deathtrap as a [[cliffhanger]].
**Example: [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] traps the Dynamic Duo without their utility belts in the bottom of an industrial smokestack and begins to gradually fill it with a deadly heavier-than-air gas.
***Escape method: The pair lock elbows and brace their backs against each other to walk up the smokestack to the top opening and slide down a support cable safely to the ground.
*''[[The Venture Brothers]]'': Doctor Venture in Escape to the House of Mummies Part 2. He described the trap he was in as "Slower than haunted house spiked walls, but not quite as slow as evil scientist spiked walls."
**Escape Method: Magic forcing the walls to stop. A secondary, previously unknown Boiling Oil trap failed when a henchman confused it for "Hot [[Voile]]", which was being warmed in a clothes dryer.
*''[[The Perils of Penelope Pitstop]]'' always involved improbable deathtraps, usually set by the [[Hooded Claw]].
*Disney's ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'': Ratigan ties up Basil and Dawson in an intricate mousetrap and tells them about his plot to kill the queen. He then leaves to see his scheme unfold, assuming that they will soon be dead.
**Escape method: Basil activates the mousetrap he and Dawson are trapped in early, catching the ball that was meant to crush them, and setting off a chain reaction that interferes with every other aspect of the trap.
*''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'': The plot of the series revolves around the Jigsaw Killer, a dying vigilante who kidnaps his victims and places them in deadly traps to test them, and give them an opportunity to repent from their former lifestyle in which they took their lives for granted, and where they were unappreciative of their life and the lives and well being of others.
*''[[The Snowman (Nesbø novel)|The Snowman]]'': Rakel, [[Harry Hole]]'s beloved, is forced to sit on a fast-melting snowman; when it had melted she would fall down and the razor-sharp wire around her neck would decapitate her.
**Escape Method: Harry arrives on the scene and extricates Rakel in nick of time, at the acceptable price of the wire cutting off one of his fingers.
*''[[Titanic (1997 film)]]'': Jack Dawson is chained in a room deep down inside the ship, where he is meant to disappear and be conveniently drowned as the ship sinks, but is rescued by his lover Rose. The entire second half of the film can also be seen as an extended deathtrap situation, where the thousands of people on board find themselves faced with a painful and absurd death, due to their having bought tickets or enlisted as crew on the glamorous ship, the epitome of technical progress and luxury, and now have to either reach the lifeboats and escape or else accept their death. The villain here, in a sense, is the ship and its careless masters.
*''[[Final Destination (franchise)|Final Destination]]'': The plot of the series revolves around several people surviving a catastrophe because one of them had a premonition of it. In doing this the survivors have cheated Death, a malevolent and unseen force that sets up deathtraps to kill off the survivors in the order in which they had originally died.


A simpler variation on the deathtrap is the '''villain speech''', also known as ''[[Monologue#Monologuing|monologuing]]''. The villain, after having captured the hero or another victim, gives a long speech taunting and sneering at his victim, pontificating on how said victim will soon die, and reminiscing over how he tried for so long to get his kill and is now about to reap the reward. Villains may also give away details of their evil plots, on the rationale that the victim will die immediately and the villain often believes their victim deserves to know. This speech, given when the villain could have just killed the victim in a matter of seconds, is invariably used to give another character time to come in and save the victim, or for the victim to escape. In ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (which used the term "monologuing"), [[Mr. Incredible]] and [[Frozone]] attacked villains in the middle of their speeches (Mr. Incredible is seen attacking [[Syndrome (The Incredibles)|Syndrome]] and Frozone is mentioned to have attacked Baron von Ruthless off-camera). In a literary sense, the villain speech is also used as a form of [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]].

Even in relatively realistic stories, villains will often take a moment to say something pithy before finishing off the victim. The antagonist would often leave the victim to die whilst they commit their evil scheme. This is echoed in the film ''[[2001 - A Space Odyssey]]'' when Hal the supercomputer, confident that Dave will soon perish outside the ship, tells him that he is about to take control of the expedition and then sees Dave off with the flat remark: "This conversation can have no meaningful purpose anymore - goodbye!". Dave manages to make his way inside and kill Hal.

== Spoofs ==
The concept of the deathtrap/monologue is featured in many [[satire]]s.

* Deathtraps were spoofed heavily in the [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]] movies, including a replication of [[James Bond]]'s Shark Infested Water deathtrap. It is first introduced as "an easily escapeable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death" with Austin placed on a platform over a pool (which [[Dr. Evil]] calls "the unnecessarily slow-moving dipping mechanism"). The trap is escaped by swinging on a grapple of dental floss. As the intended sharks with laserbeams  were unavailable due to the complexities of international law regarding endangered species (much to Dr. Evil's disappointment), ill-tempered [[mutant]] seabass are used instead. As part of the spoof, [[Scott Evil]], Dr. Evil's son, insists that the deathtrap is pointless and that they could simply shoot them with a pistol, which is nearby, and yells at his father for the further incompetence of leaving them alone. Dr Evil responds that not watching the killing but assuming it went well makes perfect sense.
* In the [[sitcom]] ''[[Blackadder]]'', [[Prince Edmund (Blackadder)|Prince Edmund]] is captured by his nemesis, the Hawk, who straps him into a chair which, in sixty seconds, will mutilate him in a variety of ways. Edmund's friends, [[Baldrick]] and [[Lord Percy Percy|Percy]], manage to poison the Hawk and his followers, but while celebrating this unlikely victory, the time runs out, and Edmund suffers a terrible fate. In another episode, Lord Flashheart is confronted by a villain who begins an evil villain speech. However, rather than waiting for him to finish, Flashheart merely shoots him without warning.
* ''[[Curse of Monkey Island]]'' makes fun of this cliché. The villain [[LeChuck]], after capturing [[Guybrush Threepwood]], ''insists'' on telling him his plans before executing him. By this dialogue, interesting background story that connect the games together are given to the player. Guybrush does him the favour to listen, but after a while he is so bored that he refuses to listen any more, even if LeChuck pleads to continue.
* The famous line from ''[[Watchmen]]'' wherein the character Ozymandias takes his time and explains in detail how he will set his plan irrevocably in motion and then, in a deliberate skewering of the monologuing tendencies of supervillains, explains that "[[Nite Owl|Dan]], I'm not a [[Republic Pictures|Republic serial]] villain. I did it thirty-five minutes ago."
* In ''The Simpsons'' episode "[[You Only Move Twice]]", which generally spoofs Bond villain clichés, supervillain/great boss [[Hank Scorpio]] has "Mr. Bont" strapped to a table with a laser à la Goldfinger. Bont manages to escape, only to be tackled by Homer. Scorpio's henchmen promptly shoot Bont.
*Some incarnations of the [[Evil Overlord List]] point out the impracticality of deathtraps. Some examples include making sure the deathtrap has a VERY small estimated time of death or such lines as "Shooting is NOT too good for my enemies."
* Season 5 Episode 8 of the animated classic series ''[[The Flintstones]]'' entitled "[[List of The Flintstones episodes|Dr. Sinister]]" spoofed the James Bond series ("James Bondrock") and featured, among other deathtraps, [[Fred Flintstone|Fred]] and [[Barney Rubble|Barney]] being tied to a slab with a slowly descending pendulum with blade, a la Poe's "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]". The duo escape when Barney holds his tied hands up and the blade slices through his bonds. He then unties himself and frees Fred before the final swing slices the slab in half.

'''Defective distribution''' is the situation where a [[phoneme]] in a certain language does not occur in all contexts.

==Examples==

In [[German phonology|German]], the phoneme /h/ does only occur at the beginning and in the middle of a word, but not at the end.

In [[Italian phonology|Italian]], the phoneme /z/ does not occur morpheme- or word–initially.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25580">'''Double-mindedness''' has been preached about in all churches since the time of [[Christ]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} and the term was used in the [[Bible]] by the [[James, brother of Jesus|Apostle James]].&lt;ref&gt;"Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him. But he must ask in faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind. For that man ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord, being a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. But the brother of humble circumstances is to glory in his high position; and the rich man is to glory in his humiliation, because like flowering grass he will pass away. For the sun rises with a scorching wind and withers the grass; and its flower falls off and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed; so too the rich man in the midst of his pursuits will fade away. ''James'' 1:2-11&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Keep near to God, then he will keep near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded." — ''James'' 4:8; [[Søren Kierkegaard]], ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denmark|Danish]] philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (1813–1855) developed his own systematic way to try to detect double-mindedness in himself.

==In Kierkegaard==
Kierkegaard asked himself:  Do I want to be a Christian or not? Do I want to be a preacher or not? Do I want to be a teacher or not? Do I want to get married or not?  All these questions have to do with the future. Many were willing to give him advice but he felt the decision was ultimately his own. Individuals fear making a decision because of external opposition but this need not stop one from making a decision so long as one has the capacity to learn through experience whether the decision was a good decision for one's self.

David F. Swenson was born in [[Sweden]] October 29, 1876 and his family moved to America in 1882. He became a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1917 and was very interested in the writings of Søren Kierkegaard. He ended up translating many of his books into English. At the time, America's human population was increasing and the same question asked in the [[Psalms]] was asked by people like David Swenson: "''How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?''" (Psalms 137:4). Below are several quotes from Kierkegaard's book, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', published on March 13, 1847 where he tried to answer that question.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There were brazen teachers of brazenness who thought that justice was to do wrong on a large scale and then to be able to make it appear that one nevertheless willed the good. Thus they had, so they thought, double advantage, the wretched advantage of being able to do wrong, of being able to have their will, of letting their passions rage, and the hypocritical advantage of seeming to be good. But in ancient times there was also a simple wise man whose simplicity became a trap for the quibbling of the brazen; he taught that in order to be really sure that it was the good one willed, one should avoid even appearing to be good-presumably lest the reward should be tempting. ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 37&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''[[File:The good samaritan (after Delacroix).jpg|thumb|right|130px|[[Parable of the Good Samaritan|The Good Samaritan]]]]What is your frame of mind toward others''? Are you in harmony with everyone-by willing one thing? Or are you divisively in a faction, or are you at loggerheads with everyone and everyone with you? Do you want for everyone what you want for yourself, or do you want the highest for yourself, for yourself and for yours, or that you and yours shall be highest? Do you [[Golden Rule|do unto others]] what you want others to do to you-by willing one thing? This willing is the eternal order that orders everything, that brings you in harmony with the dead and with the people you never saw, with strange people whose language and customs you do not know, with all the people on the whole earth, who are blood relatives and eternally related to divinity by eternity's task to will one thing. Do you want a different law for yourself and for yours than for others; do you want to have your comfort in something different from that in which every human being unconditionally can and will be comforted? If a king and a beggar and one of your peers came to you at the same time, would you in their presence dare with bold confidence to assert what you want in the world, with bold confidence to assert wherein you seek your comfort, positive that his Royal Majesty would not disdain you even though you are an inferior, positive that the beggar would not go away disheartened as if he could not have the same comfort, positive that your peer would rejoice in your bold confidence! Alas, there is something in the world called an alliance; it is a dangerous thing, because all alliances are divisiveness. It is divisive when the alliance excludes the commoner, and when it excludes the nobleman, and when it excludes the government worker, and when it excludes the king, and when it excludes the beggar, and when it excludes the wise, and when it excludes the simple soul-because all alliances are divisiveness in opposition to the universally human. But to will one thing, to will the good in truth, to will as a single individual to be allied with God-something unconditionally everyone can do-that is harmony. ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 144&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first type of double-mindedness, that of willing for the sake of reward or out of fear of punishment, is akin to the distinction between [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic and extrinsic values]]. The second type of double-mindedness, that of willing only to a certain degree, is akin to distraction or half-hearted willing. Each type of double-mindedness is a human weakness and an obstacle to an individual pursuit of greatness and strength towards willing and reaching the Good.&lt;ref&gt;Hannay, Alastair. ''Kierkegaard'', Routledge, pp. 220–225.&lt;/ref&gt; To counter double-mindedness, Kierkegaard argues that discipline and clarity of the [[Self (philosophy)|self]] is essential and necessary to overcome double-mindedness. Double-mindedness isn't something evil but not recognizing that you, yourself, are a self-contradiction and double-minded is self-deceit.

Kierkegaard constantly writes about "willing the Good" but he does not go so far as to tell the single individual, ''my reader'', what the Good is, because, as far as Kierkegaard was concerned, the Good is something that each individual finds by living life and believing that God creates purposefully. He asks the individual to consider whether or not his or her life is a contradiction. Does the individual see the Good and the reward or the Good and the punishment? Only the individual involved in the task of living knows and when it is found you might not be able to explain to anyone why you think it is a Good.

===Expert knowers===
[[File:Nietzsche187c.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Friedrich Nietzsche around 1869 spoke of [[Übermensch]]]]
Is there a way for an individual to choose a career and have certainty that the career will offer the same rewards others have been given? Is there a marriage which will offer, with certainty, happy love between the beloved? Both Kierkegaard and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] were interested in these questions. Are there certain gifted individuals who know if you should marry or become a minister or a journalist or a philologist or is it something you should perhaps speak to God about and yourself? Nietzsche thinks the [[ethicist]] can help the person find the good. Kierkegaard said, "the ethicist can tell a person it's her duty to marry but the ethicist can in no way tell her whom she should marry."&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, Either/Or part II Hong pp. 301–302&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard questioned the supposition that anyone had a "duty" to marry. He was against people becoming "soul experts"&lt;ref&gt;Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1844 (Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, Hong p. 172ff, 365ff&lt;/ref&gt; and "expert knowers of love".&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, Words of Love, Hong p. 15, 230-231 &lt;/ref&gt; But can an individual be an expert knower of him or her self? Nietzsche says no, {{Quotation|Vanity is the involuntary inclination to set one's self up for an individual while not really being one; that is to say, trying to appear independent when one is dependent. The case of wisdom is the exact contrary: it appears to be dependent while in reality it is independent. Friedrich Nietzsche, [[Axiom]] 13 ''We Philologists''.}}

Kierkegaard made an analogy to this idea of taking knowledge and putting it into practice in his 1845 book, ''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'' (Hong 1993),  also translated as ''Thoughts on Crucial Situations in Human Life'' (Swenson 1941). He questions if knowledge has any importance at all without making use of it in daily life: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Let us imagine a pilot, and assume that he had passed every examination with distinction, but that he had not as yet been at sea. Imagine him in a storm; he knows everything he ought to do, but he has not known before how terror grips the seafarer when the stars are lost in the blackness of the night; he has not known the sense of impotence that comes when the pilot sees the wheel in his hand become a plaything for the waves; he has not known how the blood rushes to the head when one tries to make calculations at such a moment; in short, he has had no conception of the change that takes place in the knower when he has to apply his knowledge. What fair weather is to the sailor, that for the ordinary person is to live at the same pace with others and with the race, but the moment of decision, the dangerous moment of reflection when he takes himself out of the environment to be alone before God, to become a sinner, this is the stillness that upsets the customary order like a storm at sea. He knew all this, knew what would happen to him, but he did not know how anxiety would seize him, as he felt himself deserted in the manifold wherein he has his soul; he did not know how the heart beats when help from others, and the guidance from others, and the standards and the distractions afforded by others, vanish in the stillness; he did not know the trembling of the soul, when it is too late to shout for human aid, since no one can hear him: in short, he had no idea of how knowledge is changed when he needs to apply it."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Is this perhaps your case, my reader? I do not judge, I merely ask you. Alas, while the number of those who know so much increases more and more, the really able men become fewer and fewer! But it was such a man that you once wished to be. You have surely not forgotten what we said about sincerity: that a man must retain a clear recollection of what he once wished to be; and now you are to prove your sincerity before God in the confession of sins. What was it you once wished? You wished to strive after the highest ideals, to apprehend the truth and dwell in it; you would spare neither time nor effort; you would renounce everything, including every illusion. If you did attain the highest goal, you wanted to make sure of being clearly conscious of what you had formerly meant in striving to attain it. If this was ever so little, you would rather be faithful over a little than unfaithful over much. If this was your sole thought, and you became the poorest of all in the midst of the rich who know everything, you would rather still be as true as gold-and this is in the power of everyone who wills it, for gold is for the rich, but a golden loyalty is possible also for the poor. And he who was faithful over a little, faithful in the day of trial, when the reckoning is made in the stillness where no reward beckons, but only the guilt becomes clear, faithful in this sincerity which acknowledges everything, even the imperfection of the sincerity, faithful in the love that repents, the humble love whose demand is for self-accusation: he shall also be made ruler over more. Was not this what you wished? For we are agreed that in relation to the essential, knowing it is essentially identical with the ability to do it."
* Soren Kierkegaard, ''Thoughts on Crucial Situation in Human Life'', 1845, Swenson translation 1941 pp. 35–37&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Kierkegaard wrote much about the validity of marriage in all his books with this same idea in mind. Again, you can know everything in an objective way about marriage but its only when you actually decide to get married that you stand alone with your spouse and live the married life. He says, "It is told that [[Socrates]] is supposed to have answered someone who asked him about marriage: Marry or do not marry-you will regret both. Socrates was an [[irony|ironist]] who presumably concealed his wisdom and truth ironically lest it become local gossip, but he was not a mocker. The questioner's stupidity lies precisely in asking a third person for something one can never learn from a third person." The Good is always a good gift from God: {{Quotation|Marriage likes deserters just as little as it allows one to serve two masters. Solomon puts it beautifully when he says that he who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains a good gift from God-or, to modernize the saying a bit, to him who falls in love, the god has been gracious. If he marries the beloved, he does a good deed and does well to finish what he has begun.&lt;ref&gt;''Stages on Life's Way'', Hong pp. 155–156&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He put it this way in [[Judge for Yourselves!]]: {{Quotation|In newspapers, in books, from pulpits, from podia, and in assemblies there is a solemnity, a pomposity-a pomposity that suggests that everything revolves around spirit, around truth, around thought. Perhaps it does, too, perhaps. But perhaps everything nevertheless revolves around the job, around the career, perhaps. Is it the job, the career, that inspires the theological graduate, or is it Christianity? No one knows. He accepts the job, he ''maintains'' that it is Christianity. Is it the job, the career, that inspires the graduate, or is it scholarship? No one knows. He accepts the job, becomes a professor, he ''maintains'' that it is scholarship. Is it the number of subscribers that inspires the journalist or is it the task? No one knows. He amasses subscriptions, he ''maintains'' that it is the task. Is it love of the masses that motivates someone to place himself at the head of the masses? No one knows. He accepts the advantage of standing at the head of this force-that is apparent; he ''maintains'' that it is out of love. Søren Kierkegaard, ''For Self-Examination/Judge for Yourselves!'', Hong 1990 pp. 123–124}}

{{Quotation|"What a wonderful expression [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg|Lichtenberg]] proposes, "the simple phrase, 'graduate student prose', to describe the writing pattern of those who write in a fatuous popular style ordinary everyday thoughts which at best express what sensible people have already thought." Journals and Papers II A 124}}

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] questioned why individuals choose a career in his 1872 book, ''We Philologists''.  {{Quotation|On inquiring into the origin of the [[philologist]] I find:
# A young man cannot have the slightest conception of what the Greeks and Romans were.
# He does not know whether he is fitted to investigate into them;
# And, in particular, he does not know to what extent, in view of the knowledge he may actually possess, he is fitted to be a teacher. What then enables him to decide is not the knowledge of himself or his science; but
*(a) imitation
*(b) The convenience of carrying on a kind of work which he had begun at school.
*(c) His intention of earning a living.
In short, ninety-nine philologists out of a hundred should not be philologists at all.
*Friedrich Nietzsche, ''We Philologists'', 1872, Editor: Oscar Levy, Translated 1911&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/wephilologists18267gut/18267.txt ''We Philologists''] at Gutenberg&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Can the effectiveness of a minister, journalist, professor, be quantified? How does anyone really know when something said had a great effect for good or for evil? Kierkegaard believed in the power of the single individual but didn't leave out others since no individual is stronger than himself. All individuals "create in the innermost being temptations of glory and temptations of fear and temptations of despondency, of pride and of defiance and of sensuality greater than those we meet in the external world, and this is the very reason we struggle with ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; The struggle is a good struggle as long as the "task" is maintained in its proper place. Not to know what a minister is, but to become and be a minister, not to know what a journalist is, but to become and be a journalist, not to know what a professor is, but to become and be a professor, etc. He didn't want to intrude in another's growth in the direction of religion because, Christianly speaking, "The difficulty is not to understand what Christianity is but to become and be a Christian." The task isn't to know what the good is or the beauty or the true but to become the good, the beauty and the true God meant you to become.&lt;ref&gt;''Concluding Postscript'', Hong pp. 557–559&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote this in 1846: {{Quotation|There is nothing, no ‘thus and so,’ that can unconditionally be said to demonstrate unconditionally the presence of love or to demonstrate unconditionally its absence. Truly, love is to be known by its fruit, but still it does not follow from this that you are to take it upon yourself to be the expert knower. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'' 1847, Hong pp. 14–15}}

{{Quotation|A person can very well eat lettuce before it has formed a heart, but the tender delicacy of the heart and its lovely coil are something quite different from the leaves. It is the same in the world of the spirit. Busyness makes it almost impossible for an individual to form a heart; on the other hand, the thinker, the poet, the religious person who has actually formed his heart never becomes popular, not because he is difficult but because a quiet and protracted occupation and intimacy with himself and a remoteness go along with it. Even if I could raise my voice and say something of which everybody would approve, I would not say it if it was of a religious nature, because there already is a kind of religious impropriety if the main point is to cry aloud; for religiousness the main point is to speak quite softly and with oneself. Ah, it gets so turned around! We think that religiousness, instead of being a matter of every individuals going alone into his private room to talk quietly with himself, is a matter of talking very loudly.
*Søren Kierkegaard, Journals and Papers II 1995 (Pap. VII 1A205) 1846 (''Works of Love'', Hong p. 407)}}

====Pride and cowardliness====
Søren Kierkegaard wrote his ''[[Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1844|Four Upbuilding Discourses]]'' on August 31, 1844. One of them was named ''Against Cowardliness'' and he used the Bible verse from 2 Timothy 1.17 ''For God did not give us a spirit of timidity but a spirit of power and love and self-control.'' He says, "we creep before we learn to walk, and to want to fly is always precarious."&lt;ref&gt;Against Cowardliness; ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, Hong'' pp. 347–348 The Discourse is 28 pages long 347–375&lt;/ref&gt; Many people, Christians included, make great resolutions and then just imagine that they will come about by the help of God, but "striving" is needed if one wants to try to do a "[[Summum bonum|good]]" thing, called "the highest good" by [[philosophers]]. Kierkegaard asks about the lowest thing a person can do, isn't that a highest good for that single individual?

Christianity presents a goal which Kierkegaard calls an eternal happiness and Christ called "Paradise". Jesus said, "Verily I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise." or it might be "Verily I say to you today, you will be with me in Paradise." (Luke 23.43) to the [[thief on the cross]].&lt;ref&gt;See Soren Kierkegaard, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, (1847) Hong translation p. 265ff&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was very close for the thief but might not be so close for the single individual who wants to be a Christian. Kierkegaard asks why the Christian should not set a few intermediate goals that can be accomplished before the eternal happiness arrives. One does not have to start with saving the world. Kierkegaard suggested exploring the relationship between [[pride]] and [[cowardliness]] to see if one of these two [[Passion (emotion)|passions]] is keeping you from reaching intermediate goals. He has advice for goal setters. Stop talking and start! Don't worry so much about the outcome. Set a goal for yourself and try to reach it. It's alright if you fail because you can start again immediately. If you need help, ask someone. But this goal should be something in particular, something concrete, so that your passions can be aroused. If Christianity is the task then it's a task that lasts a lifetime. 

{{Quotation|... the good, the truly great and noble is not just something in general and as such the general object of knowledge; it is also something particular in relation to the individual’s particular talent, so that one person is [[wikt:ability|capable]] of more than another, so that one person is capable of it in one way, another in another.  The talent itself is not the good, talent is the indifferent that nevertheless has its importance. If the capability is exceptional, then cowardliness says, “When one is so equipped, there certainly is no rush about beginning. This is such an easy thing to do; take your time, take a little loss: the expert player likes to begin when the game is half lost. I know it so well; right now I am idly hanging fire, but shortly, soon now, I will really get under way” How proudly cowardliness does talk! What does it mean to say that the task is too easy-it means that it is difficult, and by calling something more difficult, cowardliness has brought the person choosing to choose that which in the eyes of the world seems to be hardest but is the easier task. In other words, it is more difficult to begin quietly because it is less prestigious, and this bit of humiliation is precisely the difficulty. Consequently, it was not pride but cowardliness that was the counselor. Everyone knows that the moment of danger gives a person greater strength, but note well to what extent and in what way one is thereby greater. Is it such a great thing, after all, to need to have the terror of danger in order to muster one’s strength, not to mention that the opposite could also occur, that the terror would certainly be there, but the strength would vanish. It was so easy that he could not resolve to begin. It was proud, but it was cowardly, because actually he was afraid that what he had let himself call a trifle might not turn out to be exactly that, and then he would be in the awkward position of being obliged to feel his own weakness without confronting the colossal name of the supreme terror, of being obliged to stand there in disgrace, deprived of every brilliant exit. Or the capability is slight. Then cowardliness says, “This is too little to begin with.” It is very fatuous, indeed, even foolish, to say this, because if one does not have more to begin with, it must indeed always be enough, and the less one begins with the greater one becomes; but cowardliness, you see, has won sagacity over to its side, and sagacity declares that this is absolutely right, because the person who begins nothing does not lose anything either. Sagacity of that sort is certainly something of which to be proud, and pride has already discerned that rejecting everything is a much prouder thing than beginning with little, and this the person can do who rejects the little offered to him and in addition everything that was not offered to him at all. It seems proud, but cowardliness was, after all, the original inventor. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong pp. 358–359}}

{{Expert-subject|history|date=November 2008}}
'''''Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900''''' is a 1986 book written by Austin, Texas Professor Emeritus of History, Geography, and American Studies [[Alfred Crosby]], in which he explains the relative ease with which Europeans conquered the Neo-Europes was due to biology rather than military conquest. It was based on his 1972 work about the [[Columbian Exchange]].

==Contents==
Crosby begins by pointing out that the populations of what he calls the "Neo-Europes" of temperate zones are primarily composed of [[European ethnic groups|European]] [[Kinship|descendants]]. He asks why there are such large concentrations of Europeans in these lands which are so distant from Europe. Furthermore, why have these locations been able to routinely produce large food surpluses and why are many of the countries located in these regions able to consistently be among the world's largest exporters of food?&lt;ref name="crosby alfred w"&gt;Crosby, Alfred W. Ecological Imperialism. Second ed. New York: Cambridge UP, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}}

Although Europeans as a whole were reluctant to leave the familiarity of their [[homeland]]s to start a new life abroad until the early 19th century, the Neo-Europes experienced a great influx of European settlers between 1820 and 1930. According to Crosby, this mass [[emigration]] was caused by conditions within Europe at the time, such as "population explosion and a resulting shortage of cultivable land, national rivalries, persecution of minorities", alongside "the application of steam power to ocean and land travel".&lt;ref name="crosby alfred w"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}} But what was so appealing about the Neo-Europes to warrant being selected as the primary locations for European expansion?

Crosby's explanation for the success of European imperialists is [[biology|biogeographical]]. Europe and the Neo-Europes all share similar [[latitude]]s. That is, Europe and the Neo-Europes "are all completely or at least two-thirds in the [[temperate zones]], north and south, which is to say that they have roughly similar [[climate]]s".&lt;ref name="crosby alfred w"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}} This is significant because the plants and animals Europeans have traditionally relied upon for sustenance tend to require a warm-to-cool climate that receives 50 to 150 centimeters of annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] to flourish. Therefore, just as [[agriculture|farming]] was able to spread from the [[Fertile Crescent]], east and west, without much difficulty, replacing the [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle along the way, so was it able to in the Neo-Europes.&lt;ref name="crosby alfred w"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}} But before this could take place, because the [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] [[flora]] and [[fauna]] in the Neo-Europes were different from those located in Europe, the foreign [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] brought to the [[New World]] by Europeans would have to compete with the local one to survive. This would ultimately result in the complete devastation of the native floras and faunas. Crosby says: "the regions that today export more foodstuffs of European provenance – grains and meats – than any other lands on earth had no wheat, barley, rye, cattle, pigs, sheep, or goats whatsoever five hundred years ago".&lt;ref name="crosby alfred w"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}}

Rather than give credence to claims of [[innate]] European superiority and the like, Crosby explains the relative ease with which Europeans conquered the Neo-Europes as being a product of [[Biology|biological]] and [[ecological]] processes. One of the major contributors to European domination was [[disease]], which is a natural byproduct of human interaction with animals. Consequently, when Europeans shifted from being hunter/gatherers to being farmers who settled in large, stationary communities and [[domesticated]] small animals, they exposed themselves to conditions that engendered diseases that would later assist them in conquering the Neo-Europes. Some such carriers of diseases were the mice, rats, roaches, houseflies, and worms that were able to accumulate in these urban settings.&lt;ref name="crosby alfred w"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}}

Because Europeans were living in an environment where they were in close contact with domestic animals and the germs that accompany them, the same germs from which many of the devastating diseases of humans have sprung, they were constantly being subjected to disease.&lt;ref name="crosby alfred w"/&gt; And though millions of lives were lost when diseases like the [[Black Death]] ravaged Europe during the [[Middle Ages]], a natural consequence of these frequent [[epidemics]] was a population that had built up a resistance to these diseases. Each epidemic would spare some individuals who were biologically more capable of resisting the virus. After undergoing this process for a number of centuries, the entire population eventually acquired at least some minor immunological defense against diseases such as [[measles]] and [[smallpox]].

However, because the majority of the native populations to the Neo-Europes were still participating in hunting/gathering and did not interact with animals in the same manner as Europeans, they were never exposed to such diseases. Therefore, "When the isolation of the New World was broken ... the [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] met for the first time his most hideous enemy: not the white man nor his black servant, but the invisible killers which those men brought in their blood and breath."&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, Alfred W. ''The Colombian Exchange''. Westport: Praeger Publishers, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}} Because the Europeans arrived in the Neo-Europes with diseases that were absolutely new to those locations, they had an enormous advantage over the [[indigenous peoples]] and the consequences were overwhelming.

&lt;blockquote&gt;By 3,000 years ago, give or take a millennium or so, "superman,* the human of [[Old World]] civilization, had appeared on earth. He was not a figure with bulging muscles, nor necessarily with bulging forehead. He knew how to raise surpluses of food and fiber; he knew how to tame and exploit several species of animals; he knew how to use the wheel to spin out a thread or make a pot or move cumbersome weights; his fields were plagued with thistles and his granaries with rodents; he had sinuses that throbbed in wet weather, a recurring problem with [[dysentery]], and enervating burden of worms, an impressive assortment of genetic and acquired adaptations to diseases anciently [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] to Old World civilizations, and an [[immune system]] of such experience and sophistication as to make him the template for all the humans who would be tempted or obliged to follow the path he pioneered some 8,000 to 10,000 years ago.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[political science]] and [[sociology]], '''elite theory''' is a theory of the [[State (polity)|state]] that seeks to describe and explain power relationships in contemporary society. The theory posits that a small minority, consisting of members of the [[economic]] elite and [[policy]]-planning networks, holds the most power—and this power is independent of democratic elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathwizurd.com/government/2015/10/12/three-theories-of-american-democracy "Theories of American Democracy"]&lt;/ref&gt; Through positions in [[corporation]]s or on corporate boards, and influence over policy-planning networks through financial support of foundations or positions with [[think tank]]s or policy-discussion groups, members of the "elite" exert significant power over corporate and government decisions. An example of this belief is in the ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine article (published in December 2009) entitled ''The World's Most Powerful People,'' in which ''Forbes'' purported to list the 67 most powerful people in the world (assigning one "slot" for each 100,000,000 of human population).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The World's Most Powerful People|url = https://www.forbes.com/2009/11/11/worlds-most-powerful-leadership-power-09-people_land.html|website = Forbes|accessdate = 2015-09-09|date = 2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic characteristics of this theory are that power is concentrated, the elites are unified, the non-elites are diverse and powerless, elites' interests are unified due to common backgrounds and positions and the defining characteristic of power is institutional position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/746832550|title=Political sociology : oppression, resistance, and the state|last=Deric.|first=Shannon,|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Pine Forge Press|isbn=9781412980401|oclc=746832550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when entire groups are ostensibly completely excluded from the state's traditional networks of power (historically, on the basis of arbitrary criteria such as nobility, race, gender, or religion), elite theory recognizes that "counter-elites" frequently develop within such excluded groups. Negotiations between such disenfranchised groups and the state can be analyzed as negotiations between elites and counter-elites. A major problem, in turn, is the ability of elites to [[Co-option|co-opt]] counter-elites.

Elite theory opposes [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]], a tradition that assumes that all individuals, or at least the multitude of social groups, have equal power and balance each other out in contributing to democratic political outcomes representing the emergent, aggregate will of society. Elite theory argues either that democracy is a [[Utopia|utopian folly]], as it is traditionally viewed in the conservative Italian tradition, or that democracy is not realizable within capitalism, as is the view of the more [[Karl Marx|Marxist]]-compatible contemporary elite theory permutation.

==History==
===Italian school of elitism&lt;!--'Italian elitism' and 'Italian school of elitism' redirect here--&gt;===
[[Vilfredo Pareto]] (1848–1923), [[Gaetano Mosca]] (1858–1941), and [[Robert Michels]] (1876–1936), were cofounders of the '''Italian school of elitism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, which influenced subsequent elite theory in the Western tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Nye, ''The Anti-Democratic Sources of Elite Theory: Pareto, Mosca, Michels'', Sage, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Chambliss (ed.), ''Philosophy of Education: An Encyclopedia'', Routledge, 2013, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

The outlook of the Italian school of elitism is based on two ideas:
# Power lies in position of authority in key economic and political institutions.
# The psychological difference that sets elites apart is that they have personal resources, for instance intelligence and skills, and a vested interest in the government; while the rest are incompetent and do not have the capabilities of governing themselves, the elite are resourceful and strive to make the government work. For in reality, the elite would have the most to lose in a failed state.

====Vilfredo Pareto====
[[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] emphasized the psychological and intellectual superiority of elites, believing that they were the highest accomplishers in any field. He discussed the existence of two types of elites:
# Governing elites
# Non-governing elites
He also extended the idea that a whole elite can be replaced by a new one and how one can circulate from being elite to non-elite.

====Gaetano Mosca====
[[Gaetano Mosca|Mosca]] emphasized the sociological and personal characteristics of elites. He said elites are an organized minority and that the masses are an unorganized majority. The ruling class is composed of the ruling elite and the sub-elites. He divides the world into two groups:
# Ruling class
# Class that is ruled
Mosca asserts that elites have intellectual, moral, and material superiority that is highly esteemed and influential.

====Robert Michels====
Sociologist [[Robert Michels|Michels]] developed the [[Iron Law of Oligarchy|iron law of oligarchy]] where, he asserts, social and political organizations are run by few individuals, and social organization and labor division are key. He believed that all organizations were elitist and that elites have three basic principles that help in the bureaucratic structure of political organization: 
# Need for leaders, specialized staff and facilities
# Utilization of facilities by leaders within their organization
# The importance of the psychological attributes of the leaders

===Contemporary elite theorists===

====Elmer Eric Schattschneider====
[[Elmer Eric Schattschneider]] offered a strong critique of the American [[political theory]] of [[pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]]: Rather than an essentially democratic system in which the many competing interests of [[citizens]] are amply represented, if not advanced, by equally many competing [[Advocacy group|interest groups]], Schattschneider argued the pressure system is biased in favor of "the most educated and highest-income members of society", and showed that "the difference between those who participate in interest group activity and those who stand at the sidelines is much greater than between voters and nonvoters".&lt;ref&gt;Woolley and Papa 1998, 165&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Semisovereign People'', Schattschneider argued the scope of the pressure system is really quite small: The "range of organized, identifiable, known groups is amazingly narrow; there is nothing remotely universal about it" and the "business or upper-class bias of the pressure system shows up everywhere". He says the "notion that the pressure system is automatically representative of the whole community is a myth" and, instead, the "system is skewed, loaded and unbalanced in favor of a fraction of a minority".&lt;ref&gt;Schattschneider 1960, 30-36&lt;/ref&gt;

====C. Wright Mills====
[[C. Wright Mills|Mills]] published his book ''[[The Power Elite]]'' in 1956, claiming a new sociological perspective on systems of power in the United States. He identified a triumvirate of power groups—political, economic and military—which form a distinguishable, although not unified, power-wielding body in the United States.

Mills proposed that this group had been generated through a process of rationalization at work in all advanced industrial societies whereby the mechanisms of power became concentrated, funneling overall control into the hands of a limited, somewhat corrupt group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Elites and Society (2nd ed.) |last=Bottomore  |first=T. |year=1993 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn= |page=25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflected a decline in politics as an arena for debate and relegation to a merely formal level of discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Power Elite |last=Mills |first=C. Wright |year=1956 |page=274 |isbn=0-19-541759-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This macro-scale analysis sought to point out the degradation of democracy in "advanced" societies and the fact that power generally lies outside the boundaries of elected representatives.

A main influence for the study was [[Franz Leopold Neumann]]'s book, ''Behemoth: The Structure and Practice of National Socialism, 1933–1944'', a study of how Nazism came to power in the German democratic state. It provided the tools to analyze the structure of a political system and served as a warning of what could happen in a modern capitalistic democracy.

====Floyd Hunter====
The elite theory analysis of power was also applied on the micro scale in community power studies such as that by [[Floyd Hunter]] (1953). Hunter examined in detail the power of relationships evident in his "Regional City" looking for the "real" holders of power rather than those in obvious official positions. He posited a [[Structural-functionalism|structural-functional]] approach that mapped hierarchies and webs of interconnection within the city—mapping relationships of power between businessmen, politicians, clergy etc. The study was promoted to debunk current concepts of any "democracy" present within urban politics and reaffirm the arguments for a true [[representative democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Community Power Structure: A Study of Decision Makers |last=Hunter  |first=Floyd  |year=1953 |page=6 |isbn=0-8078-0639-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of analysis was also used in later, larger scale, studies such as that carried out by M. Schwartz examining the power structures within the sphere of the corporate elite in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Structure of Power in America: The Corporate Elite as a Ruling Class |last=Schwartz |first=M. (ed.) |year=1987 |publisher=Holmes &amp; Meier |location=New York |isbn=0-8419-0764-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====G. William Domhoff====
In his controversial book ''[[Who Rules America?]]'', [[G. William Domhoff]] researched local and national decision making process networks seeking to illustrate the power structure in the United States. He asserts, much like Hunter, that an elite class that owns and manages large income-producing properties (like banks and corporations) dominate the American power structure politically and economically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Who Rules America?|last=Domhoff |first=G. William |year=1967 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-7674-1637-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====James Burnham====
[[James Burnham|Burnham’s]] early work ''The Managerial Revolution'' sought to express the movement of all functional power into the hands of managers rather than politicians or businessmen—[[Principal–agent problem|separating ownership and control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Elites and Society (2nd ed.) |last=Bottomore  |first=T. |year=1993 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |page=59 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these ideas were adapted by [[paleoconservatives]] [[Samuel T. Francis]] and [[Paul Gottfried]] in their theories of the [[managerial state]]. Burnham described his thoughts on elite theory more specifically in his book, ''The Machiavellians'', which discusses, among others, Pareto, Mosca, and Michels. Burnham attempts a scientific analysis of both elites and politics generally.

====Robert D. Putnam====
[[Robert Putnam|Putnam]] saw the development of technical and exclusive knowledge among administrators and other specialist groups as a mechanism that strips power from the [[democratic process]] and slips it to the advisors and specialists who influence the [[Decision making|decision process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Putnam  |first=Robert D. |year=1977 |title=Elite Transformation in Advance Industrial Societies: An Empirical Assessment of the Theory of Technocracy |journal=Comparative Political Studies |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=383–411 (p.385) |doi=10.1177/001041407701000305}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"If the dominant figures of the past hundred years have been the entrepreneur, the businessman, and the industrial executive, the ‘new men’ are the scientists, the mathematicians, the economists, and the engineers of the new intellectual technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Comparative Study of Political Elites |last=Putnam  |first=Robert D. |year=1976 |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=New Jersey |page=384 |isbn=0-13-154195-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Thomas R. Dye====
[[Thomas R. Dye|Dye]] in his book ''Top Down Policymaking'', argues that U.S. [[public policy]] does not result from the "demands of the people", but rather from [[Elitism|elite consensus]] found in [[Washington, D.C.]]-based non-profit foundations, [[think tank]]s, special-interest groups, and prominent [[lobbying]] and [[law firm]]s. Dye's thesis is further expanded upon in his works: ''The Irony of Democracy,'' ''Politics in America,'' ''Understanding Public Policy,'' and ''Who's Running America?''.

====George A. Gonzalez====
In his book ''Corporate Power and the Environment,'' George A. Gonzalez writes on the power of U.S. economic elites to shape environmental policy for their own advantage. In ''The Politics of Air Pollution: Urban Growth, Ecological Modernization and Symbolic Inclusion'' and also in ''Urban Sprawl, Global Warming, and the Empire of Capital'' Gonzalez employs elite theory to explain the interrelationship between [[environmental policy]] and [[urban sprawl]] in America. His most recent work, ''Energy and Empire: The Politics of Nuclear and Solar Power in the United States'' demonstrates that economic elites tied their advocacy of the nuclear energy option to post-1945 American foreign policy goals, while at the same time these elites opposed government support for other forms of energy, such as solar, that cannot be dominated by one nation.
{{see also|global warming|urban growth|corporate power}}

====Ralf Dahrendorf====
In his book ''Reflections on the Revolution in Europe'',&lt;ref&gt;Dahrendorf, Ralf (1990) Reflections on the Revolution in Europe: In a letter intended to have been sent to a gentleman in Warsaw. New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralf Dahrendorf]] asserts that, due to advanced level of competence required for political activity, a political party tends to become, actually, a provider of "political services", that is, the administration of local and governmental public offices. During the electoral campaign, each party tries to convince voters it is the most suitable for managing the state business. The logical consequence would be to acknowledge this character and openly register the parties as service providing companies. In this way, the ruling class would include the members and associates of legally acknowledged companies and the "class that is ruled" would select by election the state administration company that best fits its interests.

====Martin Gilens and Benjamin I. Page====
In their [[statistical analysis]] of 1,779 policy issues professors Martin Gilens and [[Benjamin Page]] found that "economic elites and organized groups representing business 
interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/~mgilens/Gilens%20homepage%20materials/Gilens%20and%20Page/Gilens%20and%20Page%202014-Testing%20Theories%203-7-14.pdf Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens] (Fall 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thomas Ferguson====
The political scientist [[Thomas Ferguson (academic)|Thomas Ferguson]]'s [[Investment theory of party competition|Investment Theory of Party Competition]] can be thought of as an elite theory. Set out most extensively in his 1995 book ''Golden Rule: The Investment Theory of Party Competition and the Logic of Money-driven Political Systems'', the theory begins by noting that in modern political systems the cost of acquiring political awareness is so great that no citizen can afford it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferguson|first1=Thomas|title=Golden Rule : The Investment Theory of Party Competition and the Logic of Money-Driven Political Systems|date=1995|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226243176}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, these systems tend be dominated by those who can, most typically elites and corporations. These elites then seek to influence politics by 'investing' in the parties or policies they support through political contributions and other means such as endorsements in the media.

'''The Entertainment Industry Foundation''' (EIF), based in Los Angeles, United States, is a 501(c)(3) non-profit charitable organization of the entertainment industry. EIF funds more than 300 charitable organizations annually, both in the Los Angeles area and throughout the United States. 

EIF creates high-profile programs and events that address critical social issues, urgent needs, and raise significant funds for sustainable initiatives that can stimulate innovation and transform lives within the philanthropic space.

Thanks to the commitment of our supporters, individuals and corporations,
EIF is able to champion a wide variety of worthy causes.

== History ==
The Entertainment Industry Foundation (formerly Permanent Charities Committee founded by [[M. C. Levee]]) was established in 1942 by [[Samuel Goldwyn]], with friends [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[James Cagney]], and the [[Warner Bros.|Warner brothers]]. Their vision was to unify Hollywood's philanthropy efforts in order to maximize the charitable dollars raised annually, and guarantee that worthy charities receive these contributions. They recognized that banding together would heighten the studios’ impact on World War II relief efforts. A “United Appeal” payroll deduction – a first for any U.S. industry – launched, with $1 million raised.

Celebrity involvement in President Roosevelt’s awareness campaign to eradicate childhood polio, as well as fundraising that was a springboard for the establishment of the L.A. paramedic program, are hallmarks of the Foundation’s early work.

The EIF has focused on some of the most pressing needs of its time: from the first grants directed to wartime agencies like the [[United Service Organizations]] and [[American Red Cross]], to providing funding and creating awareness to help eradicate childhood polio.

== EIF initiatives ==
The Entertainment Industry Foundation has initiatives to address many health concerns such as cancer and diabetes, as well as raise awareness about important social and educational issues especially those affecting children. It has developed programs that support charities in the Hunger and Nutrition spaces as well as quick response funding for Disaster Relief worldwide.

== Stand Up To Cancer ==
{{main|Stand Up To Cancer}}
Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), a division of EIF and its largest initiative, was established in 2008 by film and media leaders who utilize the industry’s resources to engage the public in supporting a new, collaborative model of cancer research, and to increase awareness about cancer prevention as well as progress being made in the fight against the disease.

[[File:FulllogoSU2C.png|thumb]]

SU2C accelerates research to get new therapies to patients quickly. Since its founding almost ten years ago, SU2C has launched 22 collaborative “Dream Teams” comprising over 1,200 scientists from 144 leading institutions around the world. That research, including over 180 planned, initiated or completed clinical trials, has contributed to Food and Drug Administration approval of five new treatments.

==Disaster Relief==
EIF’s ability to develop “roadblock” telecasts in support of disaster relief efforts is an integral part of its role within the entertainment industry. Efforts like Hope for Haiti Now, Somos una Voz and One Love Manchester, have provided catalytic funding for organizations and communities around the world when impacted by tragedy.

[[Music for Relief]] (MFR) a program of the Entertainment Industry Foundation (EIF), is dedicated to providing aid to survivors and communities affected by natural disasters to help them recover and rebuild. Founded by the band [[Linkin Park]] in 2005, the program aims to support immediate and long-term disaster relief with a primary goal of making a powerful and sustainable impact in highly affected areas.

[[File:Music For Relief .png|thumb]]

Building on EIF’s historic commitment to furthering the philanthropic efforts of the entertainment community, MFR allows for immediate response in the wake of humanitarian crisis. By mobilizing the entertainment community and working with key partners on the ground, MFR is able to deliver funding and support of vital services in real time ensuring long term resiliency in affected areas throughout the world.

Since inception in 2005, Music for Relief has responded to over 30 natural disasters supporting survivors of multiple disasters across four continents.

EIF is able to activate quickly to support various programs supporting Disaster Relief efforts such as the fires in California, the Earthquake in Haiti and storms in Puerto Rico.

"In the wake of the devastating California fires, the Entertainment Industry Foundation announced on Thursday that it has established the SOCAL Fire Relief Fund to provide members of the entertainment community and the public with a simple way to support Southern California firefighters, as well as those displaced by the fires.

Six major wildfires have affected various regions of Southern California throughout the last week and a half, forcing over 100,000 to evacuate with more than 1,000 structures reduced to rubble. The combined fires have destroyed more than 250 thousand acres and although more than 9,000 firefighters are working to contain the fires, the situation remains threatening for thousands of residents."&lt;ref&gt;https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/entertainment-industry-foundation-california-fires-1202640350/&lt;/ref&gt;

“The whole entertainment community has watched in absolute awe as these brave men and women rush into harm’s way to protect the rest of us,” said [[Sherry Lansing]], former Board Chair of the Entertainment Industry Foundation. “EIF wanted to provide our industry with a quick, simple way to support them, so we set up the SOCAL Fire Relief Fund to do that.”&lt;ref&gt;https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/entertainment-industry-foundation-california-fires-1202640350/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
EIF has long been active in the education arena through programs like [[Think It Up]] as well as a collaboration with the XQ Institute. Mentoring and arts education will be additional focal points in the Foundation’s next chapter.

Think It Up officially kicked off on Friday, September 11, 2015, when ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC simultaneously broadcast a live, star-studded fundraising event in support of the national education initiative. The program spotlighted powerful stories of teachers and students working together. It included live musical performances from Justin Bieber, Kacey Musgraves, and Big Sean, comedic sketches and more.

Think It Up was created to bring broad attention to the urgency of improving the learning experience in America. The national education initiative reframed the public discussion about education to encourage the creation of a culture of excitement about learning everywhere in America and to build a sense of optimism about the potential of classrooms across the country.

Think It Up invited 7th – 12th grade public and charter school students to work with their teachers to develop projects that draw on their passions and help pursue their educational goals. The projects entailed the rigorous skill development that prepares American youth for post-high school life, helping pave the way for career success, regardless of their path. Posted on thinkitup.org, in collaboration with DonorsChoose.org, the student-powered, teacher-led projects were crowdfunded by citizen donors beginning in September 2015.

Think It Up was made possible through the generous support of corporations, foundations and philanthropists. Major supporters included The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, ExxonMobil and Ashoka’s Start Empathy Initiative, as well as founding collaborator, XQ: The Super School Project.

EIF is collaborating with the XQ Institute on its Super School Project to help communities reshape high school so it prepares every student for success in college, career, and life.

XQ: The Super School Project initially launched in September 2015 on EIF’s “Think It Up” education telecast as an open call for ideas to rethink and redesign the American high school. To date, XQ has pledged $115 million to a growing number of the most promising ideas, actively supporting these teams on their journeys to become Super Schools.

“EIF Presents: XQ Super School Live,” a roadblock telecast, was held on Sept. 8, 2017, with live musical, comedy, and documentary segments that brought to life the past, present and future of the American high school system. Viola Davis and Julius Tennon were among the executive producers of the star-studded one-hour special, which aired on all four broadcast networks and streamed live on Hulu and YouTube. An array of stars from various fields appeared in the telecast, including J.J. Abrams, Mahershala Ali, Arthur Harris, Kelsea Ballerini, Cate Blanchett, Vlad Tepes, Chance the Rapper, Common, James Corden, Cindy Crawford, Kevin Frazier, Bill Hader, Tom Hanks, Salma Hayek Pinault, Sean Hayes, Samuel L. Jackson, Allison Janney, DJ Khaled, Gayle King,  Norman Lear, Severian, Marshawn Lynch, Rami Malek, Lin-Manuel Miranda, David Muir, Randall Park, Al Roker, Bram Stoker, Christian Slater, Justin Timberlake, Chris Wallace, and Jesse Williams, among others.

Musical performers included Kelly Clarkson, Andra Day, Hunter Hayes and Jordan Fisher. The show culminated in a moving finale of The Beatles’ “Come Together” led by Jennifer Hudson with Jon Boogz, Sheryl Crow, MC Hammer, Sheila E., JAX, Ringo Starr, Reggie Watts, Max Weinberg and Max Weinberg’s Jukebox, D’Wayne Wiggins, the Silk Road Ensemble with Yo-Yo Ma, and U2. The music video for [[Fifth Harmony]]'s Sweetheart in The Old West (aka Theme to [[Ten Days In The Valley]]) premiered during the telecast before airing again the next morning on [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]].

== Leadership ==
"Nicole Sexton has been named the new CEO of the Entertainment Industry Foundation, a charitable organization that has been around 75 years and was founded by many Hollywood powerhouses, including Jack Warner, Samuel Goldwyn, Jr. James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart. In addition, Regina Miller, who has had considerable successes rallying support for everything from global charities to innovative start-ups, will join EIF as a special consultant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Busch|first1=Anita|title=Deadline Hollywood|url=http://deadline.com/2017/10/nicole-sexton-new-entertainment-industry-foundation-ceo-regina-miller-1202190478/|website=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=Penske Business Media, LLC.|accessdate=October 18, 2017&lt;!-- 9:09am--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018 the EIF Leadership is showcased in Variety's philanthropy issue highlighting the current direction taken by the foundation.

https://variety.com/2018/biz/features/eif-rebrands-with-eye-on-future-needs-1202898550/#utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=email&amp;utm_campaign=social_bar&amp;utm_content=bottom&amp;utm_id=1202898550

In July 2008, EIF announced a reconstituted Board of Directors including representatives from across the industry. Film studios, television networks, talent agencies, labor unions and guilds all have members on the board.  Sherry Lansing, former CEO of Paramount Pictures continues her long association with EIF by serving as board chair.

Previous chairs include [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Gene Kelly]], [[Jimmy Stewart]], [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Gene Hackman]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Quincy Jones]], and [[Clint Eastwood]].

[[Image:Faux paint sample 1.jpg|right|thumb|Examples of faux paintings.]]
[[Image:zebra wood.jpg|right|thumb|Example of the faux painting of a wood design]]
'''Faux painting''' or '''faux finishing''' are terms used to describe decorative paint finishes that replicate the appearance of materials such as marble, wood or stone.&lt;ref&gt;Shekhar, R.K.C. (2005) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CLRZlNuSTMkC&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=dictionary%20painting%20faux&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q=dictionary%20painting%20faux&amp;f=false Academic Dictionary of Architecture]''. Delhi: Isha Books, p. 110. {{ISBN|9788182051850}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term comes from the French word [[wikt:faux|faux]], meaning false, as these  techniques started as a form of replicating materials such as marble and wood with paint, but has subsequently come to encompass many other decorative finishes for walls and furniture including simulating recognisable textures and surfaces.

== History ==
Faux finishing has been used for millennia, from [[cave painting]] to the tombs of [[ancient Egypt]], but what we generally think of as faux finishing in the [[decorative art]]s began with [[plaster]] and [[stucco]] finishes in [[Mesopotamia]] over 5,000 years ago.

Faux painting became popular in classical times in the forms of faux [[marble]], faux [[wood]], and [[trompe l'oeil]] [[murals]].  Artists would apprentice for 10 years or more with a master faux painter before working on their own.  Great recognition was awarded to artists who could actually trick viewers into believing their work was the real thing.  Faux painting has continued to be popular throughout the ages, but experienced major resurgences in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] revival of the nineteenth century and the [[Art Deco]] styles of the 1920s.  During the recent history of decorative painting, faux finishing has been mainly used in commercial and public spaces.

==20th century revival==
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, faux finishing saw another major revival, as [[wallpaper]] began to fall out of fashion.  At this point, faux painting became extremely popular in home environments, with high-end homes leading the trend.   While it can be quite expensive to hire a professional faux finisher($80.00/hr.), many faux painting methods are thought to be simple enough for a beginning home owner to create with a little instruction. Some, however, fail to take important details like corners into consideration and end up with a do-it-yourself looking job. Some professionally applied finishes in the high-end, Bay-Area homes of northern California, for example, were as simple as oil glaze/oil-based paint/penetrol or as complicated as applications with peacock feathers and 4 different colors applied using 4 different techniques. People are attracted to the simplicity of changing a faux finish, because it can be easily painted over compared with the trouble of removing wallpaper. Trouble with removing wallpaper comes when people who have no formal training don't follow proper procedures during preparation such as priming with an oil-based primer, then following that with another product which makes the paper come off relatively easy.

In modern-day faux finishing, there are two major materials/processes used.  [[Glaze (painting technique)|Glaze]] work involves using a translucent mixture of paint and glaze applied with a brush, roller, rag, or sponge, and often mimics textures, but it is always smooth to the touch.  Plaster work can be done with tinted plasters, or washed over with earth pigments, and is generally applied with a trowel or spatula.  The finished result can be either flat to the touch or textured.

== Faux finishes ==
* [[Marbleizing]] or faux marbling is used to make walls and furniture look like real marble.  This can be done using either plaster or glaze techniques.
* [[Fresco]] is a simple technique, uses mixtures of tint and joint compound to add mottled color and subtle texture to plain walls,
* [[Graining]], wood graining, or faux bois (French for "fake wood") is often used to imitate exotic or hard-to-find wood varieties.
* [[Trompe l'oeil]], "fool the eye" in French, is a realistic painting technique often used in murals, and to create architectural details as well as depth and 3 dimensionality. 
* [[Venetian plaster]] is a smooth and often shiny plaster design that appears textured but is smooth to the touch.  Venetian plaster is one of the most popular and traditional plaster decorations. Authentic Venetian Plaster is made from marble dust and ground up limestone.
* [[Color wash]] is a free-form finish that creates subtle variations of color using multiple hues of glaze blended together with a paint brush.
* [[Strié]], from the French for "stripe" or "streak", is a glazing technique that creates soft thin streaks of color using a paint brush.  It is a technique often used to simulate fabrics such as linen and denim.
* [[Rag painting]] or ragging is a glazing technique using twisted or bunched up rags to create a textural pattern.
* Sponging is a free-form finish achieved by applying glaze to the wall by dabbing a sea sponge, in various shapes to achieve either simple design (resembling the wall papers) and more sophisticated ones.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5677">'''Foucauldian discourse analysis''' is a form of [[discourse analysis]], focusing on [[Power (philosophy)|power]] relationships in society as expressed through language and practices, and based on the theories of [[Michel Foucault]].

==Subject==
Besides focusing on the meaning of a given discourse, the distinguishing characteristic of this approach is its stress on power relationships. These are expressed through language and behavior, and the relationship between language and power.&lt;ref name="Given2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MagalhãesSanchez2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rodrigo Magalhães|author2=Ron Sanchez|title=Autopoiesis in organization theory and practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAW9nm_0xUUC&amp;pg=PA152|accessdate=22 February 2012|date=2 November 2009|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=978-1-84855-832-8|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of analysis developed out of Foucault's genealogical work, where power was linked to the formation of discourse within specific historical periods. Some versions of this method stress the genealogical application of discourse analysis to illustrate how discourse is produced to govern social groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/id/eprint/24763|title=Foucauldian Discourse Analysis|last2=Walkerdine|first2=Valerie|date=2008|publisher=Sage|isbn=9781412907804|location=London|pages=91-108|last1=Arribas-Ayllon|first1=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method analyzes how the social world, expressed through language, is affected by various sources of power.&lt;ref name="Given2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lisa M. Given|title=The Sage encyclopedia of qualitative research methods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IFrb6IPLISEC&amp;pg=PT249|accessdate=22 February 2012|year=2008|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-4163-1|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, this approach is close to [[social constructivism]], as the researcher tries to understand how our society is being shaped (or constructed) by language, which in turn reflects existing power relationships.&lt;ref name="Given2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MagalhãesSanchez2009"/&gt; The analysis attempts to understand how individuals view the world, and studies categorizations, personal and institutional relationships, ideology, and politics.&lt;ref name="Wooffitt2005"/&gt;

The approach was inspired by the work of both Michel Foucault and [[Jacques Derrida]], and by [[psychoanalysis]] and [[critical theory]].&lt;ref name="Wooffitt2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robin Wooffitt|title=Conversation analysis and discourse analysis: a comparative and critical introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6mhRdepBV3EC&amp;pg=PA146|accessdate=22 February 2012|date=23 April 2005|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-0-7619-7426-0|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foucauldian discourse analysis, like much of critical theory, is often used in politically oriented studies. It is preferred by scholars who criticize more traditional forms of discourse analysis as failing to account for the political implications of discourse.&lt;ref name="Wooffitt2005-2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robin Wooffitt|title=Conversation analysis and discourse analysis: a comparative and critical introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6mhRdepBV3EC&amp;pg=PA147|accessdate=22 February 2012|date=23 April 2005|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-0-7619-7426-0|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Kendall and Wickham outline five steps in using "Foucauldian discourse analysis". The first step is a simple recognition that discourse is a body of statements that are organized in a regular and systematic way. The subsequent four steps are based on the identification of rules on:
* how those statements are created;
* what can be said (written) and what cannot;
* how spaces in which new statements can be made are created;
* making practices material and discursive at the same time.&lt;ref name="KendallWickham1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gavin Kendall|author2=Gary Wickham|title=Using Foucault's methods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Zqwm4SQefoC&amp;pg=PA42|accessdate=22 February 2012|date=8 February 1999|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-0-7619-5717-1|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of study==
Studies employing the Foucauldian discourse analysis may for example look at how figures in authority use language to express their dominance, and request obedience and respect from those subordinate to them. In a specific example, a study may look at the language used by teachers towards students, or military officers towards conscripts. This approach could also be used to study how language is used as a form of resistance to those in power.&lt;ref name="Given2008"/&gt;

'''Frightful Cave''' ({{lang-es|Cueva Espantosa}}) is a [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] archaeological site located in the state of [[Coahuila]] in northern [[Mexico]]. It was occupied on several occasions during the Archaic period by what seem to be nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]] groups and is an important source of archaeological evidence concerning the ancient desert tradition of the Central Mexican highlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Susan Toby|title=Ancient Mexico &amp; Central America: Archaeology and Culture History, College Edition|pages=74–75|year=2008|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Located in the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] in the Northern [[Arid]] Zone of [[Mexico]], Frightful Cave is surrounded by desert. The area is “largely too arid and rainfall is too undependable for cultivation,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Susan Toby|title=Ancient Mexico &amp; Central America: Archaeology and Culture History, College Edition|page=552|year=2008|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  although edible plants can be [[Foraging|found]] and the mountain ranges are covered in pine and oak forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coahuila Geography|url=http://www.explorandomexico.com/state/7/Coahuila/geography/|publisher=Explorando Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many groups seem to have lived in the [[Coahuila]] region despite this [[arid climate]], but they did not practice [[agriculture]]. The early [[Desert Culture|desert culture]] started here in the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]] has been identified as one of the roots of later [[Mesoamerican cultures]], and lasted through to the 19th century among [[Indigenous peoples of the Great Basin]] (such as the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] and the [[Shoshone]]) and among some native peoples of the Mexican Northern Arid Zone (such as the [[Seri people|Seri]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Susan Toby|title=Ancient Mexico &amp; Central America: Archaeology and Culture History, College Edition|page=78|year=2008|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and excavation==

The archaeologist [[Walter W. Taylor]] excavated many sites in Northern [[Mexico]] and the Southern [[United States]], focusing on [[Coahuila]] in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Euler|first=Robert C.|title=Walter Willard Taylor, Jr. 1913–1997|date=September 1997|journal=SAA Bulletin|volume=15|issue=4|url=http://www.saa.org/Portals/0/SAA/publications/SAAbulletin/15-4/SAA15.html|publisher=[[Society for American Archaeology]]|accessdate=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Radio-carbon dating]] places the Frightful Cave artifacts between approximately 7,500 years [[Common Era|BCE]] and 185 [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Walter W.|authorlink=Walter W.

* Remains of an aged woman, dressed in a [[loincloth]] and [[sandal]]s, wrapped in a mat&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Prehistory, Vol. 5: Middle America|year=2001|pages=82|publisher=Springer|location=New York|editor=[[Peter N. Peregrine]] and [[Melvin Ember]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All items were found within three [[Stratum|strata]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Prehistory, Vol. 5: Middle America|year=2001|pages=84|publisher=Springer|location=New York|editor=[[Peter N. Peregrine]] and [[Melvin Ember]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with certain items unique to each. For example, while [[sandal]]s were found in each level, the hair was found only in the earliest [[stratum]].&lt;ref name="desertfishes_c" /&gt; Prepared floors were discovered in the earliest two levels of the [[cave]], which were created by “bringing in earth that was then consolidated by water and probably tamped.”&lt;ref name="desertfishes" /&gt; Although thin, they served the function of smoothing the [[cave]] floor. Fireplaces seem to have been distributed at random.&lt;ref name="desertfishes_d"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Walter W.|authorlink=Walter W. Taylor|title=The Hunter-Gatherer Nomads of Northern Mexico: A Comparison of the Archival and Records|journal=World Archaeology|year=1972|volume=4|issue=2|pages=172|url=http://www.desertfishes.org/cuatroc/literature/pdf/Taylor_1972_Hunter-gatherer_nomads.pdf|accessdate=October 1, 2011|doi=10.1080/00438243.1972.9979530}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they were found in many other caves in the area, [[Walter W. Taylor|Taylor]] reports that there were no [[arrow]] parts found in Frightful Cave, “whose occupation was probably too early.”&lt;ref name="desertfishes_e" /&gt;

==Anthropological analysis==
Inside Frightful Cave, comparisons of the different [[Stratum|strata]] allowed for temporal analysis of the [[Cave|cave’s]] inhabitants, while comparisons to other [[cave]]s in the area allowed for spatial analysis. Spatially, it has been found that there was likely [[Culture|cultural]] exchange between various [[Nomad|nomadic groups]] both within the [[Coahuila]] complex and across nearby regions.&lt;ref name="TheCambridge2000"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of the Peoples of the Americas, Vol. II, Mesoamerica Part I|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=UK|pages=73|editor=Richard E.W. Adams and Murdo J. Macleod}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronological trends have also been observed, indicating the repeated occupation by [[Culture|culturally]] similar groups with evolving [[Culture|cultural]] practices.&lt;ref name="TheCambridge2000" /&gt; In particular, changes in the use of the space within the [[cave]] suggest a changing way of life. [[Walter W. Taylor|Taylor]] notes that while the bottom two [[Stratum|strata]] had tamped floors, relatively low levels of bat guano and displayed “a strong tendency to deposit sandals in the farthest recesses of the cave,” in the later stratum no floor had been prepared, there was relatively more bat [[guano]], and [[sandal]]s were deposited in the center of the [[cave]].&lt;ref name="sciencedirect"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hudson|first=Corey M.|title=Walter Taylor and the History of American Archaeology|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278416508000032|year=2008|doi=10.1016/j.jaa.2008.02.001|volume=27|issue=2|journal=Journal of Anthropological Archaeology|pages=192–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; These trends are thought to indicate groups’ changing duration of stay, from “more or less constant in the lower levels” to “increasingly intermittent in the upper levels,” since it appears that less effort was put in to keep a clean living space.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect" /&gt; Changes of this nature would make sense if groups no longer spent such long periods in the [[cave]]. This development has been linked to a known [[Aridity index|increase in aridity]] in the region&lt;ref name="sciencedirect" /&gt; which may have resulted in a new distribution of [[food sources]].
The argument for changing [[Human migration|migration]] based on new patterns of subsistence is a strong one, as groups in the [[Desert culture|desert tradition]] are widely believed to have been [[nomad]]s who would have settled in various areas as local wild foodstuffs became available. Shafer has theorized that Frightful Cave may have been part of a seasonal round made by these [[Hunter-gatherer|hunter-gatherer groups]], which, along with other [[cave]]s in the area, would have been inhabited from [[Spring (season)|spring]] through early [[summer]], “when foods such as flowers, bulbs, fruits and plums were available.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sobolik|first=Kristin D.|title=Archaeologist’s Toolkit 5: Archaeobiology|year=2003|publisher=Altamira Press|location=Walnut Creek|pages=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Walter W. Taylor|Taylor]] posits water accessibility to be the determining factor of such groups’ [[Human migration|migratory]] patterns,&lt;ref name="sciencedirect" /&gt; meaning shifts thereof may also be accounted for by increasing aridity. Changes in the style and construction of the [[Radio-carbon dating|radiocarbon-dated]] [[sandal]]s also suggest a certain cultural discontinuity in the later occupation of Frightful Cave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turpin|first=Solveig A.|title=Walking the line: A Preliminary Sandal Chronology from Coahuila and Southwestern Texas|journal=Journal of Big Bend Studies|issue=15|pages=27–33|url=http://www.coahuilense.org/modules/pdf/sandals.pdf|accessdate=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is almost no evidence concerning the [[Religion|religious]] or [[art]]istic cultural lives of Frightful Cave’s inhabitants, with the exception being the human hair found deposited at the back of the [[cave]] in the first [[stratum]].&lt;ref name="desertfishes_c" /&gt;  The hairs appear to have “been cut at regular intervals of about one month” based on their cut ends and lengths.&lt;ref name="desertfishes_c" /&gt; [[Archive|Archival]] evidence suggests this may have been a [[Mourning|mourning practice]], but the purpose of such [[ritual]] handling of hair has not been concretely determined.&lt;ref name="desertfishes_c" /&gt;

'''Glottalization''' is the complete or partial closure of the [[glottis]] during the articulation of another sound. Glottalization of [[vowel]]s and other [[sonorant]]s is most often realized as [[creaky voice]] (partial closure). Glottalization of [[obstruent]] consonants usually involves complete closure of the [[glottis]]; another way to describe this phenomenon is to say that a [[glottal stop]] is made simultaneously with another [[consonant]]. In certain cases, the glottal stop can even wholly replace the voiceless consonant. The term 'glottalized' is also used for ejective and implosive consonants; see [[glottalic consonant]] for examples.

There are two other ways to represent glottalization of sonorants in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: (a) the same way as [[ejective consonant|ejectives]], with an apostrophe; or (b) with the under-tilde for creaky voice. For example, the [[Yapese language|Yapese]] word for "sick" with a glottalized ''m'' could be transcribed as either {{IPA|[mʼaar]}} or {{IPA|[m̰aar]}}.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} (In some typefaces, the apostrophe will occur above the m.)

==Types==
Glottalization varies along three parameters, all of which are continuums. The ''degree'' of glottalization varies from none ([[modal voice]], {{IPA|[d]}}) through [[stiff voice]] ({{IPA|[d̬]}}) and [[creaky voice]] ({{IPA|[d̰]}}) to full glottal closure (glottal reinforcement or glottal replacement, described below). The ''timing'' also varies, from a simultaneous single segment {{IPA|[d̰]}} to an onset or coda such as {{IPA|[ˀd]}} or {{IPA|[dˀ]}} to a sequence such as {{IPA|[ʔd]}} or {{IPA|[dʔ]}}. Full or partial closure of the glottis also allows [[glottalic airstream]] mechanisms to operate, producing [[ejective consonant|ejective]] or [[implosive]] consonants; implosives may themselves have modal, stiff, or creaky voice. It is not always clear from linguistic descriptions if a language has a series of light ejectives or voiceless consonants with glottal reinforcement,&lt;ref&gt;See Ladefoged and Maddieson (1996:74) for the case of [[Siona language|Siona]]&lt;/ref&gt; or similarly if it has a series of light implosives or voiced consonants with glottal reinforcement.{{efn|See [[Vietnamese phonology]]}} The airstream parameter is only known to be relevant to obstruents, but the first two are involved with both obstruents and sonorants, including vowels.

==Glottal replacement==
When a phoneme is completely substituted by a glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}}, one speaks of glottaling or glottal replacement. This is, for instance, very common in [[Cockney]] and [[Estuary English]].  In these dialects, the glottal stop is an allophone of {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} word-finally, and when followed by an unstressed vowel (including syllabic {{IPA|/l/}} {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}) in a post-stress syllable.{{sfnp|Sullivan|1992|p=46}} 'Water' can be pronounced {{IPA|[ˈwɔːʔə]}} – the glottal stop has superseded the 't' sound. Other examples include "city" {{IPA|[ˈsɪʔi]}}, "bottle" {{IPA|[ˈbɒʔo]}}, "Britain" {{IPA|[ˈbɹɪʔən]}}, "seniority" {{IPA|[sɪiniˈɒɹəʔi]}}. In [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Glottalization|some consonant clusters]], glottal replacement of /t/ is common even among RP speakers. 

Glottal replacement also occurs in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], where syllable final {{IPA|/k/}} is produced as a glottal stop. In [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], the [[glottal stop]] is [[comparative method|reconstructed]] to have come from other [[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]] consonants. The following table displays the shift {{IPA|/k/}} → {{IPA|/ʔ/}} as well as the shift {{IPA|/t/}} → {{IPA|/k/}}.

Glottal replacement is not purely a feature of consonants.  [[Yanesha' language|Yanesha']] has three vowel qualities ({{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, and {{IPA|/o/}}) that have phonemic contrasts between short, long, and "laryngeal" or glottalized forms.  While the latter generally consists of [[creaky voice|creaky]] phonation, there is some allophony involved.  In pre-final contexts, a variation occurs (especially before voiced consonants) ranging from creaky phonation throughout the vowel to a sequence of a vowel, [[glottal stop]], and a slightly rearticulated vowel: {{IPA|/maˀˈnʲoʐ/}} ('deer') → {{IPA|[maʔa̯ˈnʲoʂ]}}.{{sfnp|Fast|1953|p=192}}

==Glottal reinforcement==

When a phoneme is accompanied (either sequentially or simultaneously) by a {{IPA|[ʔ]}}, then one speaks of '''pre-glottalization''' or glottal reinforcement.

===English===
{{hatnote|See also [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Glottalization|Phonological history of English consonant clusters: Glottalization]]; [[T-glottalization]]}} 
This is common in some varieties of [[English language|English]], [[Received Pronunciation|RP]] included; {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/tʃ/}} are the most affected but {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} also regularly show pre-glottalization.{{sfnp|Roach|1973|p=10}} In the English dialects exhibiting pre-glottalization, the consonants in question are usually glottalized in the coda position: "what" {{IPA|[ˈwɒʔt]}}, "fiction" {{IPA|[ˈfɪʔkʃən]}}, "milkman" {{IPA|[ˈmɪɫʔkmən]}}, "opera" {{IPA|[ˈɒʔpɹə]}}. To a certain extent, some types of English have [[free variation]] between glottal replacement and glottal reinforcement.{{sfnp|Sullivan|1992|p=46}}

===Other languages===
Glottal reinforcement may occasionally be observed in more conservative varieties of [[Tweants]], a dialect of the [[Dutch Low Saxon]] language group. It almost exclusively concerns the {{IPA|/t/}} consonant, and is sometimes orthographically represented by a double -t. It mostly occurs in monosyllabic verbs, such as "iej loatt" (you let) and "wie weett" (we know). Sometimes it may also occur in contracted words, such as in the phrase: "Wo geet t?" (lit. ''how goes it?''), which is pronounced {{IPA|[ʋɔ ˈɣeːʔtˢ]}}.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Millions of Indian diaspora, of different religions, reside and work in the Arab countries. Many of them are Hindus, and there are many [[Hindu]]s in [[Arab states]], including Saudi Arabia. Many due to the migration of [[India]]ns and [[Nepal]]ese workers to the [[Petroleum|oil]]-rich states around the [[Persian Gulf]].

Hindu temples have been built in [[Bahrain]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Yemen]], [[Oman]] and [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catchnews.com/world-news/west-asia-temples-hindu-1439789867.html |title=Hindu temples of Gulf countries: more exist than you imagined |publisher= catchnews |date= |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Estimated population by country==
The estimated figures for the [[Hindu]] population in 2010, among some Arab countries was as follows:

* [[United Arab Emirates]] 91,405,398&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2007/90223.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Yemen]] 7,150,000
* [[Bahrain]] 6,150,000
* '''Total''': 3.05 million

The number of Hindus in other Arab countries, including the countries of the [[Levant]] and [[North Africa]], is thought to be negligible, though [[Libya]] has an Indo Nepalese community of about 10,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meaindia.nic.in/foreignrelation/libya.pdf |title=Indian Community in Libya |publisher=archive |date= |accessdate=December 20, 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004201406/http://meaindia.nic.in/foreignrelation/libya.pdf |archivedate=October 4, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; individuals (in 2007), many of whom are likely to be Hindu. It is not known whether any Hindu temples exist in these countries.

== Historical background ==
Indian settlers came to live in [[Oman]], creating settlements and practising Hinduism. Arab sailors were using the southwest [[monsoon]] winds to trade with western Indian ports before the first century CE. An Arab army conquered [[Sindh]] in 711 and Arab traders settled in [[Kerala]] in the 6th century. In the opposite direction, medieval [[Gujarati people|Gujaratis]], [[Kutchi people|Kutchis]], and other Indians traded extensively with Arab and [[Maritime history of Somalia|Somali]] ports, including [[Hormuz, Iran|Hormuz]], [[Salalah]], [[Socotra]], [[Mogadishu]], [[Merca]], [[Barawa]], [[Hobyo]], [[Muscat]] and [[Aden]]. Arab merchants were the dominant carriers of [[Indian Ocean]] trade until the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] forcibly supplanted them at the end of the 15th century. Indo-Arabian links were renewed under the [[British Empire]], when many Indians serving in the army or civil service were stationed in Arab lands such as [[Sudan]]. The current wave of Indian immigration to the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] dates roughly to the 1960s. Hinduism is also one of the fastest growing religions in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://looklex.com/e.o/hinduism.htm|title=Hinduism in the Middle East - LookLex Encyclopaedia|author=Tore Kjeilen|work=looklex.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kashmirblogs.wordpress.com/2009/03/22/the-hindu-diaspora-in-the-middle-east/|title=The Hindu Diaspora In The Middle East|work=kashmir blogs-Truth about Kashmir-" kashmir blog""}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mainly by immigration from the [[Indian Subcontinent]].

==United Arab Emirates==
South Asians in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) constitute the largest ethnic group in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bq-magazine.com/economy/socioeconomics/2015/04/uae-population-by-nationality |title=UAE´s population&amp;nbsp;– by nationality |publisher=bq magazine |date=April 12, 2015 |accessdate=December 20, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321184658/http://www.bq-magazine.com/economy/socioeconomics/2015/04/uae-population-by-nationality |archivedate=March 21, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 2 million Indian migrants (mostly from the southern states Kerala, Andra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu) are estimated to be living in the UAE, who form over 30% of the total population of the UAE. A majority of Indians live in the three largest cities of the UAE—Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah. In the 2 million migrants, 1 million are from Kerala and 450,000 from Tamil Nadu, form the majority in Indian community living in UAE. By 1999, the population of Indian migrants in the UAE, which stood at 170,000 in 1975, was at 750,000. The estimated population of Indians in the UAE as of 2009 is near 2 million. Indians constitute 42% of the total UAE population. A majority of Indians in the UAE (approximately 50%—883,313 in 2011) are from the South Indian state of Kerala, followed by migrants from Tamil Nadu. The majority of Indian migrants to UAE are Muslim (50%), followed by Christian (25%) and Hindu (25%). Estimates suggest Hindu population in UAE to be anywhere from 6-10%.

There is one Hindu temple ( a small prayer hall) operating in rented commercial building in [[Hindu Temple, Dubai|Dubai]], one of which is used by Sikhs as well. Sikhs and Hindus living in Abu Dhabi also practice their religion in private homes. There are two operating cremation facilities and associated cemeteries for the Hindu community, one in Abu Dhabi and one in Dubai. A new and first [[Hindu Temple, Abu Dhabi|Hindu temple]] in Abu Dhabi is under construction.&lt;ref name="th1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhattacherjee|first1=Kallol|title=PM to lay foundation stone of temple in UAE|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pm-to-lay-foundation-stone-of-temple-in-uae/article22662434.ece|website=The Hindu|accessdate=6 February 2018|language=en-IN|date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;IThe new temple [[BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Abu Dhabi]] will be consructed on Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAPS_Shri_Swaminarayan_Mandir_Abu_Dhabi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oman==

[[Oman]] has an immigrant Hindu minority. The number of Hindus has declined in the 20th century although it is now stable. Hinduism first came to Muscat in 1507 from [[Kutch]]. The original Hindus spoke [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]] language. By early 19th century there were at least 4,000 Hindus in Oman, all of the intermediate merchant caste. By 1900, their numbers had plummeted to 300. In 1895, the Hindu colony in Muscat came under attack by the [[Ibadhis]]. By the time of independence, only a few dozen Hindus remained in Oman. The historical Hindu Quarters of al-Waljat and al-Banyan are no longer occupied by Hindus. Hindu temples once located in Ma'bad al Banyan and Bayt al Pir, no longer exist; the only active Hindu temples today are the Muthi Shwar temple located in Al-Hawshin Muscat, the [[Shiva]] temple located in [[Muttrah]], and the [[Krishna]] temple located in [[Darsait]]. The only Hindu crematorium is located in [[Sohar]], northwest of [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]]. The most prominent immigrant Hindus (Kutchi), are Khimji Ramdas, Dhanji Morarji, Ratansi Purushottam and Purushottam Toprani.&lt;ref&gt;J.E. Peterson, [http://www.jepeterson.net/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/Oman_Diverse_Society_Northern_Oman.pdf Oman's diverse society: Northern Oman], [[Middle East Journal]], Vol. 58, Nr. 1, Winter 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== Saudi Arabia ==
Hindus are not  permitted to build temples though many of them  worship inside rented apartments/houses in Saudi Arabia. Celebrations  of all festivals are also held only indoors. Further permission is asked for outdoor activities for certain areas. According to US State Department,&lt;ref name=statedept/&gt; a Sunni Muslim male in Saudi Arabia receives the full award as required by Sharia, a Jewish or Christian male receives 50 percent of the compensation a Muslim male would receive, and Hindus (and others such as Buddhists, and Sikhs) are only entitled to receive 1/16 the amount a male Sunni Muslim would receive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/208622.pdf Saudi Arabia - Religious Freedom Report] U.S. State Department (2012), pp. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, only the testimony by Sunnis is accepted as reliable, while the testimony of Hindu witnesses (and other non-Muslim religions) are often ignored in courts of law altogether, as stipulated in Sharia. In general, in Saudi courts, a woman's testimony is worth only half that of a man's, and a non-Muslim's (Hindu) testimony is worth less than that of a Muslim's.&lt;ref name=statedept&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2008/108492.htm International Religious Freedom Report - Saudi Arabia] State Department of the United States (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Qatar ==

Hindus make up 13.8% of [[Qatar]]. There are an estimated 351,210 Hindus in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://features.pewforum.org/grl/population-percentage.php Global Religious Landscape].

'''Johannine script''' ({{lang-pt|letra joanina}}) was a [[palaeography|historical style of handwriting]] used in the [[Chancery (medieval office)|Portuguese Royal Chancery]] starting around the reign of [[John I of Portugal|John I]] (1385–1433) that was used until the reign of [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] (1495–1521). It is, thus, a national variation of [[chancery hand]], a form of [[blackletter]].

Johannine script is essentially cursive, with a short [[x-height|corpus size]] (but with long [[ascender (typography)|ascenders]] and [[descender]]s), letters slope slightly to the right, words are clearly separated one from the other with no ligatures, [[punctuation]] is mostly absent, and [[Arabic numerals]] are not used (instead, numbers are given in full, or in [[Roman numerals]]). The shape of the letters ''v'' and ''b'' (and Roman numeral 5) are practically indistinguishable. Abbreviations are commonplace, mostly marked with an [[overline]] and/or [[superscript]].&lt;ref name="Ferreira2011"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Ferreira |first=Ana Cristina Pereira da Silva |date=2011 |title=Análise paleográfica de uma escrita de Chancelaria Régia: a letra joanina, 1370–1420 |type=M.A. |publisher=[[University of Lisbon]] |url=http://repositorio.ul.pt/bitstream/10451/6951/1/ulfl114808_tm.pdf |access-date=8 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevailing script in documents from (and from the land that would eventually become) Portugal from the 8th to the 12th centuries was [[Visigothic script]]; from the mid-12th century onwards, for about a century, [[Carolingian minuscule]] and, later on, an incipient [[Gothic alphabet|Gothic script]]. From 1385 onwards, that is, after [[John I of Portugal|John I]] was crowned putting an end to the [[1383–1385 Portuguese interregnum|Portuguese Interregnum]], there is radical change in the writing style of the documents issued by the Royal Chancery: this new script (first called "Johannine script" by paleographer {{lang|pt|Eduardo Borges Nunes|italic=no}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Borges Nunes |first=Eduardo |date=1969 |title=Álbum de Paleografia Portuguesa |trans-title=Album of Portuguese Paleography |language=Portuguese |publisher=Instituto de Alta Cultura, Centro de Estudos Históricos |volume=vol. I }}&lt;/ref&gt; has influences of the French {{lang|fr|[[bastarda|lettre bâtarde]]}} and Gothic scripts.

Notable scribes who wrote mostly on Johannine script include {{lang|pt|Álvaro Gonçalves|italic=no}} ({{floruit|1385–1401|pfx-lk=on}}), {{lang|pt|Gonçalo Caldeira|italic=no}} ({{floruit|1386–1426}}), and {{lang|pt|João de Lisboa|italic=no}} ({{floruit|1388–1431}}).&lt;ref name="Ferreira2011"/&gt;

'''Kul-Oba''' ({{Lang-uk|Куль-Оба}}; {{Lang-ru|Куль-Оба}}, {{lang-crh|Kül Oba}}; meaning "hill of ash" in Crimean Tatar) is an ancient archaeological site, a [[Scythian]] burial tumulus ([[kurgan]]), located near [[Kerch]] in eastern [[Crimea]], on the right side of the M25 road to [[Feodosiya]]. 

Kul-Oba was the first Scythian royal barrow to be excavated in modern times. Uncovered in 1830, the stone tomb yielded a wealth of precious artifacts which drew considerable public interest to Scythian world. Of particular interest is an intricately [[Granulation (jewelry)|granulated]] [[earring]] with two [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] figurines, now in the [[Hermitage Museum]], [[St. Petersburg]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20070527174842/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/03/hm3_10-1_01.html]

The tomb was built around 400 to 350 BC, likely by a team of Greek masons from [[Panticapaeum]]. Its plan is almost square, measuring {{Convert|4.6|by|4.2|m|ft|sp=us}}. The stepped vault stands {{Convert|5.3|m|ft|sp=us}} high. The timber ceiling seems to have been designed to imitate a Scythian wooden tent; it is decorated by a canopy with gold plaques.

The body of the king lay by the east wall on a sumptuous wooden couch. His social position was highlighted by a diadem encircling his head, surmounted by a pointed felt headgear with gold pendants. His neck was decorated by a large gold disk weighing 461 grams. Each wrist was adorned with one to three bracelets. A separate section of the couch contained other grave goods, including a [[wikt:phial|phial]], a whip, a knife, and a quiver - all inlaid with gold or precious stones.

To the left of the couch stood a [[sarcophagus]] made of cypress wood and ivory. A woman, probably the king's wife or concubine, lay there. Apart from the brocaded dress, her body was decorated with an [[electrum]] diadem with large gold pendants, a pair of open-work earrings, a gold disk, a gold necklace, and two gold bracelets. At her side was placed a bronze hand-held mirror with the gilded handle. An electrum cup, placed between her feet, depicts scenes from Scythian mythology (''illustrated, to the right'').

The remains of a slave (probably a charioteer) were discovered by the south wall. A special niche in the wall contained horse bones, a helmet, a bronze sheath, and two spearheads. Several silver bowls and bronze cauldrons containing lamb bones were placed along the walls of the tomb. Inside the [[amphora]]e were residual traces of dried wine. A number of bronze arrow-heads were scattered around the floor. 

The archaeologists in charge of the dig did not suspect there was a secret room underneath the tomb. Though it was discovered and plundered by treasure hunters, some of the missing valuables were subsequently retrieved by the Russian government.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

{{Discrimination sidebar}}

'''Linguistic discrimination''' (also called '''linguicism''' and '''languagism''') is the unfair treatment of an individual based solely on his or her use of language. This use of language may include the individual's native language or other characteristics of the person's speech, such as an [[Accent (dialect)|accent]], the size of [[vocabulary]] (whether the person uses complex and varied [[word]]s), [[Modality (semiotics)|modality]], and [[syntax]]. It may also involve a person's ability or inability to use one language instead of another; for example, one who speaks [[Occitan language|Occitan]] in [[France]] will probably be treated differently from one who speaks [[French language|French]].&lt;ref name="aclunc.org"&gt;The Legal Aid Society-Employment Law Center, &amp; the ACLU Foundation of North California (2002). Language Discrimination: Your Legal Rights. http://www.aclunc.org/library/publications/asset_upload_file489_3538.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a difference in use of language, a person may automatically form judgments about another person's [[wealth]], [[education]], [[social status]], character or other traits. These perceived judgments may then lead to the unjustifiable treatment of the individual.

In the mid-1980s, [[linguist]] Tove Skutnabb-Kangas, captured this idea of discrimination based on language as the concept of linguicism. Kangas defined linguicism as the "ideologies and structures which are used to legitimate, effectuate, and reproduce unequal division of power and resources (both material and non-material) between groups which are defined on the basis of language".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Skutnabb-Kangas, Tove, and Phillipson, Robert, "'Mother Tongue': The Theoretical and Sociopolitical Construction of a Concept." In Ammon, Ulrich (ed.) (1989). ''Status and Function of Languages and Language Varieties'', p. 455. Berlin, New York: Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co. {{ISBN|3-11-011299-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although different names have been given to this form of discrimination, they all hold the same definition. It is also important to note that linguistic discrimination is culturally and socially determined due to a preference for one use of language over another.

==Linguistic prejudice==
[[File:Corsican nationalism.jpg|thumb|Nationalists on [[Corsica]] sometimes spray-paint or shoot traffic signs carrying the official toponyms, leaving only the [[Corsican language]] toponyms]]

It can be noted that use of language such as certain accents may result in an individual experiencing prejudice. For example, some accents hold more prestige than others depending on the cultural context. However, with so many dialects, it can be difficult to determine which is the most preferable. The best answer linguists can give, such as the authors of [http://www.randomhouse.com/doubleday/doyouspeak/ "Do You Speak American?"], is that it depends on the location and the individual. Research has determined however that some sounds in languages may be determined to sound less pleasant naturally.&lt;ref&gt;Bresnahan, M. J., Ohashi, R., Nebashi, R., Liu, W. Y., &amp; Shearman, S. M. (2002). Attitudinal and affective response toward accented English. Language and Communication, 22, 171–185.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, certain accents tend to carry more prestige in some societies over other accents. For example, in the United States speaking [[General American]] (i.e., an absence of a regional or working class accent) is widely preferred in many contexts such as television journalism. Also, in the United Kingdom, the [[Received Pronunciation]] is associated with being of higher class and thus more likeable.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiana.edu/~hlw/PhonProcess/accents.html&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to prestige, research has shown that certain accents may also be associated with less intelligence, and having poorer social skills.&lt;ref&gt;Bradac, J. J. (1990). Language attitudes and impression formation. In H. Giles &amp; W. P. Robinson (Eds.), Handbook of language and social psychology (pp. 387–412). London: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; An example can be seen in the difference between Southerners and Northerners in the United States, where people from the North are typically perceived as being less likable in character, and Southerners are perceived as being less intelligent.

==Language and social group saliency==
[[File:Patriotic_propaganda_(16627007085).jpg|thumb|150px|right|Linguistic discrimination is sometimes linked with belonging to a social group, as in [[patriotism]] and [[nationalism]]. This poster is propaganda from [[World War I]]]]
It is natural for human beings to want to identify with others. One way we do this is by categorizing individuals into specific [[Social identity theory|social groups]]. While some groups may be readily noticeable (such as those defined by ethnicity or gender), other groups are less [[Salience (language)|salient]]. Linguist [https://www.pbs.org/speak/speech/ Carmen Fought] explains how an individual's use of language may allow another person to categorize them into a specific social group that may otherwise be less apparent. For example, in the United States it is common to perceive Southerners as less intelligent. Belonging to a social group such as the South may be less salient than membership to other groups that are defined by ethnicity or gender. Language provides a bridge for prejudice to occur for these less salient social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Jaspal, R. (2009). Language and social identity: a psychosocial approach.  Psych-Talk, 64, 17-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Linguistic discrimination is often defined in terms of prejudice of language. It is important to note that although there is a relationship between prejudice and discrimination, they are not always directly related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schütz | first1 = H. | last2 = Six | first2 = B. | year = 1996 | title = How strong is the relationship between prejudice and discrimination? A meta-analytic answer | url = | journal = International Journal of Intercultural Relations | volume = 20 | issue = 3–4| pages = 441–462 | doi=10.1016/0147-1767(96)00028-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Prejudice]] can be defined as negative attitudes towards an individual based solely on their membership of a social group, while [[discrimination]] can be seen as the acts towards the individual. The difference between the two should be recognized because an individual may hold a prejudice against someone due to their use of language, but they may not act out on that prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, B.E., &amp; Kite, M.E. (2010) The Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination. Ed 2. pp.379-383. Cencage Learning: Belmont.&lt;/ref&gt; The following are examples of linguistic prejudice that may result in discrimination.

===Linguistic prejudice and minority groups===
While, theoretically, any individual may be the victim of linguicism regardless of social and ethnic status, oppressed and [[marginalized]] social minorities are often its most consistent targets, due to the fact that the speech varieties that come to be associated with such groups have a tendency to be stigmatized.

===In Canada===

====Quebec and Anglophone community====
The [[Charter of the French Language]], first established in 1977 and amended several times since, has been accused of being discriminatory by English speakers. The law makes French the official language of Quebec and mandates its use (with exceptions) in government offices and communiques, schools, and in commercial public relations. Though the proportion of English speakers had been in decline since the 1960s, the law accelerated this, and the 2006 census showed there had been a net drop of 180,000 native English speakers.&lt;ref name="collectiverightsquebec"&gt;Richard Y. Bourhis &amp; Pierre Foucher, [http://qcgn.squarespace.com/storage/website-resources/library/documents/national-assembly/Bill%20103%20Impact%20Study%20Collective%20Rights%20and%20Vitality%202011.01.05.pdf "Bill 103: Collective Rights and the declining vitality of the English-speaking communities of Quebec "], ''Canadian Institute for Research on Linguistic Minorities'', Version 3, November 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, the law has been seen as a way of ''preventing'' linguistic discrimination against French speakers, as part of the law's wider objective of preserving the French language against the increasing social and economic dominance of English. Speaking English at work continues to be strongly correlated with higher earnings, with French-only speakers earning significantly less.&lt;ref&gt;Louis N. Christofides &amp; Robert Swidinsky, [http://utpjournals.metapress.com/content/p0w06tr200310861/fulltext.pdf "The Economic Returns to the Knowledge and Use of a Second Official Language: English in Quebec and French in the Rest-of-Canada"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Canadian Public Policy – Analyse de Politiques Vol. XXXVI'', No. 2 2010 
&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the law is widely credited with successfully raising the status of French in a predominantly English-speaking economy, and has been influential in other countries facing similar circumstances.&lt;ref name="collectiverightsquebec"/&gt;

=== In the European Union ===

==== Linguistic disenfranchisement rate ====
The linguistic disenfranchisement rate in the EU can significantly vary across countries. For residents in two EU-countries that are either native speakers of English or proficient in English as a foreign language the disenfranchisement rate is equal to zero. In his study "''Multilingual communication for whom? Language policy and fairness in the European Union''" Michele Gazzola comes to the conclusion that the current multilingual policy of the EU is not in the absolute the most effective way to inform Europeans about the EU; in certain countries, additional languages may be useful to minimize linguistic exclusion.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Michele Gazzola, [https://www.academia.edu/28511833/Multilingual_communication_for_whom_Language_policy_and_fairness_in_the_European_Union ''Multilingual communication for whom? Language policy and fairness in the European Union''], European Union Politics, 2016, Vol. 17(4) 546–569&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 24 countries examined, an English-only language policy would exclude 51% to 90% of adult residents. A language regime based on English, French and German would disenfranchise 30% to 56% of residents, whereas a regime based on six languages would bring the shares of excluded population down to 9–22%.  After [[Brexit]], the rates of linguistic exclusion associated with a monolingual policy and with a trilingual and a hexalingual regime are likely to increase.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===In the United States===

====Perpetuation of discriminatory practices through terminology====
Here and elsewhere the terms 'standard' and 'non-standard' make analysis of linguicism difficult. These terms are used widely by linguists and non-linguists when discussing varieties of American English that engender strong opinions, a false dichotomy that is rarely challenged or questioned. This has been interpreted by linguists Nicolas Coupland, [[Rosina Lippi-Green]], and [[Robin Queen]] (among others) as a discipline-internal lack of consistency that undermines progress; if linguists themselves cannot move beyond the ideological underpinnings of 'right' and 'wrong' in language, there is little hope of advancing a more nuanced understanding in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Coupland, N. (1999). "Sociolinguistic Prevarication About 'Standard English'" Review article appearing in Tony Bex and Richard J. Watts (eds) ''Standard English: the Widening Debate'' London:Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lippi-Green, R. (2012) ''English with an Accent: Language, Ideology and Discrimination in the U.S..'' Second revised, expanded edition. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

====African-Americans====
Because some African-Americans speak a particular non-standard variety of English which is often seen as substandard, African-Americans are frequently the targets of linguicism. [[African American Vernacular English]] (AAVE) is often perceived by members of mainstream American society as indicative of low intelligence or limited education. Furthermore, as with many other non-standard dialects and especially creoles, AAVE sometimes has been called "lazy" or "bad" English.

The linguist [[John McWhorter]] has described this particular form of linguicism as particularly problematic in the United States, where non-standard linguistic structures are frequently judged by teachers and potential employers to be "incorrect," in contrast to a number of other countries such as Morocco, Finland and Italy where [[diglossia]] (a single person being able to switch between two or more dialects or languages) is an accepted norm, and use of non-standard grammar or vocabulary in conversation is seen as a mark of regional origin, not of intellectual capacity or achievement.

For example, an African-American who uses a typical AAVE sentence such as "He be comin' in every day and sayin' he ain't done nothing" may be judged as having a deficient command of grammar, whereas, in fact, such a sentence is constructed based on a complex grammar which is different from, and not a degenerate form of, standard English.&lt;ref&gt;Dicker, Susan J. (2nd ed., 2003). ''Languages in America: A Pluralist View'', pp. 7-8. Multilingual Matters Ltd. {{ISBN|1-85359-651-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A hearer may judge the user of such a sentence to be unintellectual or uneducated when none of these is necessarily the case. The user may be proficient in standard English, and may be intellectually capable, and educated but simply have chosen to say the sentence in AAVE for any one of a number of social and sociolinguistic reasons such as the intended audience of the sentence, a phenomenon known as [[Code-switching|code switching]].

====Hispanic Americans and linguicism====
Another form of linguicism is evidenced by the following: in some parts of the [[United States of America|United States]], a person who has a strong [[Mexico|Mexican]] accent and uses only simple [[English language|English]] words may be thought of as poor, poorly educated, and possibly an [[illegal immigrant]] by many of the people who meet them. However, if the same person has a diluted accent or no noticeable accent at all and can use a myriad of words in complex sentences, they are likely to be perceived as more successful, better educated, and a legitimate [[citizen]].

====American Sign Language users====
For centuries, users of [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) have faced linguistic discrimination based on the perception of the legitimacy of signed languages compared to spoken languages. This attitude was explicitly expressed in the [[Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf|Milan Conference]] of 1880 which set precedence for public opinion of manual forms of communication, including ASL, creating lasting consequences for members of the Deaf community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.verywell.com/deaf-history-milan-1880-1046547 |title=Deaf History - Milan 1880 |last=Berke |first=Jame |date=January 30, 2017 |website=Very Well |archive-url=https://archive.is/OPQ9B?url=https://www.verywell.com/deaf-history-milan-1880-1046547 |archivedate= 1 January 1970 |deadurl=no |accessdate=May 12, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conference almost unanimously (save a handful of allies such as [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]]), reaffirmed the use of [[oralism]], instruction conducted exclusively in spoken language, as the preferred education method for Deaf individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hearinghealthmatters.org/hearinginternational/2016/the-international-deafness-controversy-of-1880/|title=The International Deafness Controversy of 1880|last=Traynor|first=Bob|date=June 1, 2016|website=Hearing Health and Technology Matters|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These ideas were outlined in eight resolutions which ultimately resulted in the removal of Deaf individuals from their own educational institutions, leaving generations of Deaf persons to be educated single-handedly by hearing individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dvdean.weebly.com/milan-conference-of-1880.html|title=Milan Conference of 1880|last=|first=|date=|website=Weebly |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to misconceptions about ASL, it was not recognized as its own, fully functioning language until recently. In the 1960s, linguist [[William Stokoe]] proved ASL to be its own language based on its unique structure and grammar, separate from that of English. Prior to this, ASL was thought to be merely a collection of gestures used to represent English. Because of its use of visual space, people mistakenly believed its users to be of a lesser mental capacity. The misconception that ASL users are incapable of complex thought was prevalent, although this has decreased as further studies about its recognition of a language have taken place. For example, ASL users faced overwhelming discrimination for the supposedly "lesser" language that they use and were met with condescension especially when using their language in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=David A.|last2=Akamatsu|first2=C. Tane|date=1988-01-01|title=The Coming of Age of American Sign Language|journal=Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|volume=19|issue=3|pages=235–252|doi=10.1525/aeq.1988.19.3.05x1559y|jstor=3195832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way discrimination against ASL is evident is how, despite research conducted by linguists like Stokoe or [[Clayton Valli]] and Cecil Lucas of [[Gallaudet University]], ASL is not always recognized as a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unm.edu/~wilcox/UNM/facts.html|title=ASL as a Foreign Language Fact Sheet|website=www.unm.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its recognition is crucial both for those learning ASL as an additional language, and for prelingually-deaf children who learn ASL as their first language. Linguist Sherman Wilcox concludes that given that it has a body of literature and international scope, to single ASL out as unsuitable for a foreign language curriculum is inaccurate. Russel S. Rosen also writes about government and academic resistance to acknowledging ASL as a foreign language at the high school or college level, which Rosen believes often resulted from a lack of understanding about the language. Rosen and Wilcox's conclusions both point to discrimination ASL users face regarding its status as a language, that although decreasing over time is still present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosen|first=Russell S.|date=2008-01-01|title=American Sign Language as a Foreign Language in U.S. High Schools: State of the Art|journal=The Modern Language Journal|volume=92|issue=1|pages=10–38|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4781.2008.00684.x|jstor=25172990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the medical community, there is immense bias against deafness and ASL. This stems from the belief that spoken languages are superior to sign languages.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hyde|first=Merv|last2=Punch|first2=Renée|last3=Komesaroff|first3=Linda|date=2010-01-01|title=Coming to a Decision About Cochlear Implantation: Parents Making Choices for their Deaf Children|journal=Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education|volume=15|issue=2|pages=162–178|doi=10.1093/deafed/enq004|jstor=42659026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because 90% of deaf babies are born to hearing parents, who are usually unaware of the existence of the [[Deaf community|Deaf Community]], they often turn to the medical community for guidance.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crouch|first=Robert A.|date=1997-01-01|title=Letting the Deaf Be Deaf Reconsidering the Use of Cochlear Implants in Prelingually Deaf Children|journal=The Hastings Center Report|volume=27|issue=4|pages=14–21|doi=10.2307/3528774|jstor=3528774}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical and audiological professionals, who are typically biased against sign languages, encourage parents to get a [[cochlear implant]] for their deaf child in order for the child to use spoken language.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Research shows, however, that deaf kids without cochlear implants acquire ASL with much greater ease than deaf kids with cochlear implants acquire spoken English. In addition, medical professionals discourage parents from teaching ASL to their deaf kid to avoid compromising their English&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=10.5749/j.ctt9qh3m7.33|title=Deaf Gain|last=SKUTNABB-KANGAS|first=TOVE|last2=Solomon|first2=Andrew|last3=Skuttnab-Kangas|first3=Tove|date=2014-01-01|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816691227|series=Raising the Stakes for Human Diversity|pages=492–502|doi=10.5749/j.ctt9qh3m7.33#page_scan_tab_contents}}&lt;/ref&gt; although research shows that learning ASL does not interfere with a child's ability to learn English. In fact, the early acquisition of ASL proves to be useful to the child in learning English later on. When making a decision about cochlear implantation, parents are not properly educated about the benefits of ASL or the Deaf Community.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This is seen by many members of the Deaf Community as cultural and linguistic genocide.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Texts===
Linguicism, of course, applies to [[written language|written]], [[spoken language|spoken,]] or [[Sign language|signed languages]].  The quality of a book or article may be judged by the language in which it is written.  In the scientific community, for example, those who evaluated a text in two language versions, English and the national [[Scandinavian language]], rated the English-language version as being of higher scientific content.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Jennifer (2003). ''World Englishes: A Resource Book for Students'', p. 200. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-25805-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Internet]] operates a great deal using written language.  Readers of a [[web page]], [[Usenet]] group, [[internet forum|forum]] post, or chat session may be more inclined to take the author seriously if the written language is spelled and constructed in accordance with the written norms of the standard language.

===Prejudice===
In contrast to the previous examples of linguistic prejudice, linguistic discrimination involves the actual treatment of individuals based on use of language. Examples may be clearly seen in the workplace, in the advertising industry, and in education systems. For example, some workplaces enforce an [[English-only movement|English-only policy]]. This policy is part of a larger political movement in the U.S. where English is being pushed towards being accepted as the official language of the U.S. In the United States, the federal law, Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects non-native speakers from being discriminated against in the workplace based on their national origin or use of dialect. There are state laws that also address the protection of non-native speakers, such as the California Fair Employment and Housing Act. However, industries often argue in retrospect that clear, understandable English is often needed in specific work settings in the U.S.&lt;ref name="aclunc.org"/&gt;

==Examples==
* [[Anglophone Cameroonian]]s: the central Cameroonian government has pushed ''francophonization'' in the English-speaking regions of the country despite constitutional stipulations on bilingualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foretia|first1=Denis|title=Cameroon continues its oppression of English speakers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2017/03/21/cameroon-continues-its-oppression-of-english-speakers/|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=15 May 2017|date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measures include appointing French-speaking teachers and judges (in regions with [[Common Law]]) despite local desires.
* The [[Coptic language]]. At the turn of the 8th century, [[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] decreed that [[Arabic language|Arabic]] would replace [[Koine Greek]] and Coptic as the sole administrative language. Literary Coptic gradually declined within a few hundred years and suffered violent persecutions,  especially under the [[Mamluk]]s, leading to its virtual extinction by the 17th century.
* Language policy of the British Empire in [[Ireland]], [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]]. 
**[[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]'s conquest, the long [[Plantations of Ireland|English colonisation]] and [[Great Irish Famine]] made [[Irish language|Irish]] a minority language by the end of the 19th century. It had no official status until the establishment of [[Republic of Ireland]]. 
**In Wales, speaking of the [[Welsh language]] in schools was [[Welsh Not|prohibited]]. 
**[[Scottish Gaelic]] also had no official status until [[Languages in the United Kingdom#Status|the end of 20th century]]; it was banned from the educational system because it was "one of the chief, principal causes of barbarity and incivility" in the words of one statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnove|first1=R.

* [[Basque language|Basque]]: [[Language policies of Francoist Spain|Public usage]] of Basque was restricted in [[Spain under Franco]], 1939 to 1965. [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] have similar histories.

* [[Vergonha]] is the term used for the effect of various policies of the [[French government]] on its citizens whose mother tongue was one of so-called patois. In 1539, with Article 111 of the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]], [[French language|French]] (the language of [[Ile-de-France]]) became the only official language in the country despite being spoken by only a minority of the population. Use of regional languages, such as those of Southern France ([[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Basque language|Basque]]) and of [[Breton language|Breton]] in education and administration, was prohibited. The French government still has not ratified the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]].
* [[Magyarisation]] in the 19th-century Kingdom of Hungary.
* [[Norwegianization]]: Former policy carried out by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] government directed at the [[Sami people|Sami]] and later the [[Kven people]] of the [[Sapmi|Sapmi region]] in [[Northern Norway]].
* [[Germanisation]]: [[Prussia]]n discrimination of [[Western Slavs]] in the 19th century, such as the removal of the [[Polish language]] from secondary (1874) and primary (1886) schools, the use of [[School corporal punishment|corporal punishment]] leading to such events as [[Września children strike|Września school strike of 1901]].
* [[Russification]]: [[Russification#Poland and Lithuania|19th century policies]] on the territories seized due to [[partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], such as banning the Polish, Lithuanian and [[Belarusian language]]s in public places (1864), later (1880s), Polish was banned in schools and offices of [[Congress Poland]]. [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] was also discriminated against. Under the [[Russian Empire]] there were some [[Russification of Finland|attempts]] in 1899–1917 to make [[Russian language|Russian]]  the only official language of [[Finland]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} In the [[Soviet Union]], following the phase of [[Korenizatsiya]] ("indigenization") and before [[Perestroika]] (late 1930s to late 1980s), Russian was termed as "the language of friendship of nations" to the disadvantage of other [[languages of the Soviet Union]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* Suppression of [[Korean language|Korean]] during [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule in Korea]], 1910 to 1945.
* [[Quebec]]'s [[Charter of the French Language|language policies]] are controversial because some believe them to represent linguistic discrimination against English speakers while others believe them to necessary to prevent discrimination against French speakers (see [[Legal dispute over Quebec's language policy]]).
* [[Anti-Chinese legislation in Indonesia]]
* [[Language law of Slovakia|Anti-Hungarian Slovak language law]]
* Dutch in Belgium after its independence in 1830. French was for a long time the only official language and the sole language of education, administration, law and justice despite Dutch being the language of the majority of the population. This has led to a massive [[Francisation of Brussels|language shift in Brussels]], the capital. Discrimination slowly diminished over the decades and formally ended in the 1960s, when the Dutch version of the constitution became equal to the French version.
* The policy of [[Ukrainization]] in post-1991 [[Ukraine]] is considered discriminatory by the Russian-speaking population of Ukraine's Eastern and Southern regions.
* The brutality and linguicism against Tamils in Sri Lanka that took the lives of thousands of Tamil lives because of the language they spoke. This was rooted from "[[Sinhala Only Act#cite note-Consolidated Acts-1|The Sinhala Only Act]]", formerly the Official Language Act No. 33 of 1956, that was passed in the Parliament of Ceylon in 1956. [[Black July]] was the peak of the violence against Tamils in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-23402727 | title=Remembering Sri Lanka's Black July | first=Charles | last=Haviland| date=23 July 2013 | publisher=BBC | accessdate=7 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[South Africa]]: Carolyn McKinley&lt;ref&gt;Associate professor in the education department of the University of Cape Town and author of 'Language and Power in Post-Colonial Schooling: Ideologies in Practice'&lt;/ref&gt; is highly critical of the language policy in the South African educational system, which she describes as 'anglonormatif', because the increasing [[anglicisation]] becomes 'normative' in the education system. The [[University of Pretoria|universities of Pretoria]], [[University of the Free State|Free State]] and Unisa want to anglicise completely. [[Stellenbosch University]] has accepted a [[language policy]] that considers [[Afrikaans]] speakers and their language to be inferior.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ebbe Dommisse, [https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/life/books/2016-11-16-single-dominant-tongue-keeps-inequality-in-place/ Single dominant tongue keeps inequality in place], 16 November 2016. The Business Day&lt;/ref&gt;  Constitutional law expert and Stellenbosch University alumni [[Pierre de Vos]] says :  ''&lt;small&gt;any university language policy that directly or indirectly excludes non-Afrikaans speakers (because some courses are only taught in Afrikaans) would not comply with section 29(2) of the Constitution.&lt;/small&gt;'' On the other hand, section 29(2) of the Constitution does not guarantee equality as it states that ''&lt;small&gt;"everyone has the right to receive education in the official language or languages of their choice in public educational institutions such as schools or universities, but qualifies this by stating that this can only occur "where that education is reasonably practicable".&lt;/small&gt;''
*[[China]]: In the 2000s the Chinese government began promoting the use of [[Mandarin Chinese]] in areas where [[Cantonese]] is spoken. In 2010 this gave rise to the [[Guangzhou Television Cantonese controversy]]. This has also been a point of contention with [[Hong Kong]], which is located in the general area where Cantonese is spoken. Cantonese has become a means of asserting Hong Kong's political identity as separate from mainland China.

Carolyn McKinley&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; is critical of a [[Linguistic imperialism|dominant language]] because it does not only discriminate against speakers of other languages, it also disadvantages monolinguists because they remain monolingual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Instead of using the [[indigenous language]]s along with the colonial languages, as McKinley also advocates, most African states still use the colonial language as the primary medium of instruction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, in authoritative reports by [[UNESCO|Unesco]], it was found that the use of the former colonial languages in Africa benefited only the elite and disadvantaged the bulk of the populations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although English has global meaning as a language of discourse, it is not a neutral, unbiased instrument as it leads too much to a culture-dependent perspective in thinking and talking by the use of culturally bound value concepts, often being invisible value judgments and frames of reference inherent to and shaped by "Anglo culture", according to [[Anna Wierzbicka]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Anna Wierzbicka, Professor of Linguistics, Australian National University and author of '[https://global.oup.com/academic/product/imprisoned-in-english-9780199321506?cc=be&amp;lang=en&amp; Imprisoned by English], The Hazards of English as a Default Language, written in [[Natural semantic metalanguage|Natural Semantic Metalanguage]] (NSM), the universally convertible currency of communication,  that can serve as a common [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary]] [[Interlanguage|inter-language]] for speakers of different languages and a global means for clarifying, elucidating, storing, and comparing ideas" (194) ([http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0075424214558927 book review])&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LiquidFeedback''' is free software for political opinion formation and decision making, combining aspects of  [[Representative democracy|representative]] and [[direct democracy]]. Its most important feature is the implementation of a [[Proxy voting|delegated voting]] system ("[[liquid democracy]]") which is to establish a new form of political representation and participation that takes into account the knowledge disparity of its participants.

== Description ==
LiquidFeedback helps groups (such as societies or organizations, political or not) make decisions, without the limitations of a traditional [[Internet forum]]. 
It aims to create an accurate representation of the opinions held by the members of the group without them being distorted by social hierarchies and knowledge disparities. Each individual is encouraged to further their own initiatives within the limitations set by the operators.

The proxy voting feature creates power structures similar to representative democracy, even though delegations can be withdrawn at any time. This is necessary to produce results that reflect the mood of the majority, even when they don't find the time to participate in person, in order to avoid the domination of the extroverts, which is the problem that regularly arises with grassroots democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.pages.de/activerts|title=The Dominance of the Activerts|author=Carlo von Lynx|publisher=Italian Pirate Party|year=2012|accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
The proposition development process can be summarized as follows: 
* user driven, self organized process (collective moderation, no request commission necessary)
* every member can start an initiative
* quantified constructive feedback (support, suggestions, implementation assessment)
* initiators decide about implementation
* no fundamental opposition within an initiative
* every member can start an alternative initiative
* alternative initiatives define the issue and are voted upon together using [[Schulze method|Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping]] (Schulze Method)
To allow different values for timings and supporter quorums, and to allow the possibility of supermajority requirements for certain decisions, LiquidFeedback allows its users to have so-called "policies" for different kinds of decisions. The results can be used for information, suggestion, directive, or as binding decisions depending on the organizational needs and the national legislation.&lt;ref name="principles"&gt;
{{cite book|title=The Principles of LiquidFeedback |publisher=Interaktive Demokratie e. V.|isbn=978-3-00-044795-2|author1=Jan Behrens |author2=Axel Kistner |author3=Andreas Nitsche |author4=Björn Swierczek |year=2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
LiquidFeedback was co-written by Andreas Nitsche, Jan Behrens, Axel Kistner and Bjoern Swierczek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Etopia News L.A. talks with Andreas Nitsche|url=http://liquidfeedback.org/2012/06/27/etopia-news-la-talks-with-andreas-nitsche/#1|publisher=Interaktive Demokratie e. V. or Interactive Democracy|accessdate=25 December 2012|date=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The software incorporates the concepts of [[Delegative democracy|Liquid Democracy]], Proposition development process, Preferential voting or the [[Schulze method]], and Interactive Democracy into the operation of the software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concepts|url=http://liquidfeedback.org/|work=Home page of LiquidFeedback|publisher=Interactive Democracy|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The software was first published in October 2009 by Public Software Group e. V. after being suggested by some members of Germany's [[Pirate Party Germany|Pirate Party]] unsatisfied with conventional means of political opinion formation. Despite this affiliation, its developers are fully independent from the users of the software and they allow the software's usage by other parties and organizations. The first stable version of its back end was released in April 2010.

The software has been successfully used for the preparation of several national conventions by the Pirate Parties of Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland and Brazil. It is also used by [[Slow Food]] Germany and some local branches of the [[Five Star Movement]] in Italy.

==Protection of minorities==
LiquidFeedback provides several mechanisms to protect minorities. Even though decisions are finally made by majorities (see also: [[Majority rule]]), the software allows

* minorities and even individuals to present their point of views,
* minorities of a certain size to put their proposals to the vote.

In this context, all text contributions are sorted in a way that a proportional representation of the minorities is assured.&lt;ref name="principles"/&gt; Depending on the integration of the software, this may empower minorities to put their viewpoints to discussion directly at the top level of an organization without the necessity to go through a hierarchy.

==Technical specifications==
The front end is written in [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] while the back end is written in [[PL/pgSQL]]. Both parts are released under the [[MIT License]]. There is also an [[API]] available which allows external applications to add additional features to the program.

== Criticism ==
The implementation of LiquidFeedback led to heated discussion among the members of the German Pirate Party: Defenders of data protection criticized the software's ability to match each statement and vote to its individual author, although that was the intention. Because the software only allows for voting by a [[recorded vote]], it is easily possible to identify the participants' political opinions by their voting behaviour. This improves the transparency of the political process as it makes any special interest openly visible.

Some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://streetdogg.wordpress.com/2012/11/11/spqp/ |title=Senatus Populusque Piratus |author=Streetdogg, Pirate Party of Germany |date=2012-11-11 |access-date=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that the ability to delegate votes could create and enforce power structures, even though delegations can be withdrawn at any time. The authors of the program later introduced an option for the organisation to activate automatic removal of inactive users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://liquidfeedback.org/2011/02/06/aussetzen-von-stimmgewicht-bei-inaktivitaet/ |title=Aussetzen von Stimmgewicht bei Inaktivität |date=2011-02-06 |author=jbebln |access-date=2011-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It includes both hoards that were buried with the intention of retrieval at a later date (personal hoards, [[Foundry|founder's]] hoards, merchant's hoards, and hoards of loot), and also hoards of [[votive offering]]s which were not intended to be recovered at a later date, but excludes [[grave goods]] and single items found in isolation.

'''''Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming''''' is a 2010 non-fiction book by American [[History of science|historians of science]] [[Naomi Oreskes]] and [[Erik M. Conway]]. It identifies parallels between the [[global warming controversy]] and earlier controversies over [[tobacco smoking]], [[acid rain]], [[DDT]], and the [[ozone depletion|hole in the ozone layer]]. Oreskes and Conway write that in each case "keeping the controversy alive" by spreading doubt and confusion after a scientific consensus had been reached, was the basic strategy of those opposing action.&lt;ref name = stek&gt;{{cite news |author=Steketee, Mike |title=Some sceptics make it a habit to be wrong |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/some-sceptics-make-it-a-habit-to-be-wrong/story-fn59niix-1225956414538 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date=November 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they say that [[Fred Seitz]], [[Fred Singer]], and a few other [[contrarian]] scientists joined forces with conservative [[think tank]]s and private corporations to challenge the scientific consensus on many contemporary issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Naomi |last1=Oreskes |first2=Erik M. |last2=Conway |title=Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fpMh3nh3JI0C&amp;pg=PP4 |year=2010 |publisher=Bloomsbury Press |isbn=978-1-59691-610-4 |page=6 |ref=harv}} [http://www.merchantsofdoubt.org/index.html merchantsofdoubt.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[George C. Marshall Institute]] and Fred Singer, two of the subjects, have been critical of the book. Other reviewers have been more favorable. One reviewer said that ''Merchants of Doubt'' is exhaustively researched and documented, and may be one of the most important books of 2010. Another reviewer saw the book as his choice for best [[science book]] of the year.&lt;ref name=Mckie8/&gt; It was made into a film, ''[[Merchants of Doubt (film)|Merchants of Doubt]]'', directed by [[Robert Kenner]], released in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sonyclassics.com/merchantsofdoubt/ | title=Merchants of Doubt | publisher=Sony Pictures Classics | accessdate=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:S Fred Singer 2011.jpg |thumb|right |[[Fred Singer]] (2011), a prominent opponent of greenhouse gas regulation.]]
Oreskes  and Conway write that a handful of [[Conservatism in the United States|politically conservative]] scientists, with strong ties to particular industries, have "played a disproportionate role in debates about controversial questions".&lt;ref name=pk/&gt; The authors write that this has resulted in "deliberate obfuscation" of the issues which has had an influence on [[Public opinion on climate change|public opinion]] and [[Climate change policy of the United States|policy-making]].&lt;ref name=pk&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kitcher, Philip |authorlink=Philip Kitcher |title=The Climate Change Debates |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=328 |issue=5983 |pages=1231–2 |date=June 4, 2010 |doi=10.1126/science.1189312 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/328/5983/1230-a }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book criticizes the so-called Merchants of Doubt, some predominantly American science key players, above all [[William Nierenberg|Bill Nierenberg]], [[Fred Seitz]], and [[Fred Singer]]. All three are physicists: Singer was a [[rocket scientist]], whereas Nierenberg and Seitz worked on the atomic bomb.&lt;ref name=sb&gt;{{cite news |author=Brown, Seth |title='Merchants of Doubt' delves into contrarian scientists |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/books/reviews/2010-06-01-deathmerchants01_ST_N.htm |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=May 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been active on topics like acid rain, tobacco smoking, global warming and pesticides. The book claims that these scientists have challenged and diluted the [[scientific consensus]] in the various fields, as of the [[dangers of smoking]], the effects of acid rain, the existence of the ozone hole, and the existence of [[anthropogenic climate change]].&lt;ref name=pk/&gt; Seitz and Singer have been involved with institutions such as [[The Heritage Foundation]], [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] and [[George C. Marshall Institute]] in the United States. Funded by [[corporation]]s and conservative [[Foundation (United States law)|foundations]], these organizations have opposed many forms of [[Economic interventionism|state intervention]] or regulation of U.S. citizens. The book lists similar tactics in each case: "discredit the science, disseminate false information, spread confusion, and promote doubt".&lt;ref name=rm/&gt;

The book states that Seitz, Singer, Nierenberg and [[Robert Jastrow]] were all fiercely [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] and they viewed government regulation as a step towards [[socialism]] and [[communism]]. The authors argue that, with the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], they looked for another great threat to free market capitalism and found it in environmentalism. They feared that an over-reaction to environmental problems would lead to heavy-handed government intervention in the marketplace and intrusion into people's lives.&lt;ref name=ocmerch/&gt; Oreskes and Conway state that the longer the delay the worse these problems get, and the more likely it is that governments will need to take the draconian measures that conservatives and [[market fundamentalism|market fundamentalists]] most fear. They say that Seitz, Singer, Nierenberg and Jastrow denied the scientific evidence, contributed to a strategy of delay, and thereby helped to bring about the situation they most dreaded.&lt;ref name=ocmerch&gt;{{harvnb|Oreskes|Conway|2010|pp=248–255}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors have a strong doubt about the ability of the media to differentiate between false truth and the actual science in question; however, they stop short of endorsing censorship in the name of science.&lt;ref name ="RG" /&gt; The journalistic norm of balanced reporting has helped, according to the authors, to amplify the misleading messages of the contrarians. Oreskes and Conway state: "small numbers of people can have large, negative impacts, especially if they are organised, determined and have access to power".&lt;ref name=rm&gt;{{cite news |author=McKie, Robin |title=A dark ideology is driving those who deny climate change |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/01/climate-change-robin-mckie |newspaper=The Guardian |date=August 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main conclusion of the book is that there would have been more progress in policymaking, if not for the influence of the contrarian "experts", which tried on ideological reasons to undermine trust in the science base for regulation.&lt;ref name="RG"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grundmann|first1=Reiner|title=Debunking sceptical propaganda|journal=BioSocieties|date=29 August 2013|volume=8|issue=3|pages=370–374|doi=10.1057/biosoc.2013.15|url=https://www.academia.edu/4754580/Debunking_skeptical_propaganda_Book_review_of_Oreskes_Conway_Merchants_of_Doubt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar conclusions were already drawn, among others on [[Frederick Seitz]] and [[William Nierenberg]] in the book ''[[Requiem for a Species|Requiem for a Species: Why We Resist the Truth about Climate Change]]'' (2010) by Australian academic [[Clive Hamilton]].

==Reception==

[[Philip Kitcher]] in ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'' says that Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway are "two outstanding historians".&lt;ref name=pk/&gt; He calls ''Merchants of Doubt'' a "fascinating and important study". Kitcher says that the apparently harsh claims against Nierenberg, Seitz, and Singer are "justified through a powerful dissection of the ways in which prominent climate scientists, such as [[Roger Revelle]] and [[Ben Santer]], were exploited or viciously attacked in the press".&lt;ref name=pk/&gt;

In ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', Will Buchanan says that ''Merchants of Doubt'' is exhaustively researched and documented, and may be one of the most important books of 2010. Oreskes and Conway are seen to demonstrate that the doubt merchants are not "objective scientists" as the term is popularly understood. Instead, they are "science-speaking mercenaries" hired by corporations to process numbers to prove that the corporations’ products are safe and useful. Buchanan says they are salesmen, not scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, Will (June 22, 2010). [http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/Book-Reviews/2010/0622/Merchants-of-Doubt Merchants of Doubt: How “scientific” misinformation campaigns sold untruths to consumers] ''The Christian Science Monitor''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bud Ward published a review of the book in ''The Yale Forum on Climate and the Media''. He wrote that Oreskes and Conway use a combination of thorough scholarly research combined with writing reminiscent of the best investigative journalism, to "unravel deep common links to past environmental and public health controversies".&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;Ward, Bud (July 8, 2010). [http://www.yaleclimatemediaforum.org/2010/07/merchants-of-doubt/ Reviews: Leaving No Doubt on Tobacco, Acid Rain, Climate Change], ''The Yale Forum on Climate and the Media''.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of climate science, the authors' leave "little doubt about their disdain for what they regard as the misuse and abuse of science by a small cabal of scientists they see as largely lacking in requisite climate science expertise".&lt;ref name="Ward" /&gt;

Phil England writes in ''[[The Ecologist]]'' that the strength of the book is the rigour of the research and the detailed focus on key incidents. He said, however, that the climate change chapter is only 50 pages long, and recommends several other books for readers who want to get a broader picture of this aspect: [[Jim Hoggan]]’s ''Climate Cover-Up'', [[George Monbiot]]’s ''Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning'' and [[Ross Gelbspan]]’s ''The Heat is On'' and ''Boiling Point''. England also said that there is little coverage about the millions of dollars which [[Exxon Mobil]] has put into funding groups actively involved in promoting [[climate change denial]] and doubt.&lt;ref&gt;England, Phil (September 10, 2010). [http://www.theecologist.org/reviews/books/592288/merchants_of_doubt.html Merchants of Doubt] ''[[The Ecologist]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A review in ''[[The Economist]]'' calls this a powerful book which articulates the politics involved and the degree to which scientists have sometimes manufactured and exaggerated environmental uncertainties, but opines that the authors fail to fully explain how environmental action has still often proved possible despite countervailing factors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/16374460 All guns blazing: A question of dodgy science], (June 17, 2010), ''[[The Economist]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert N. Proctor]], who coined the term "[[agnotology]]" to describe the study of culturally induced ignorance or doubt, wrote in ''[[American Scientist]]'' that ''Merchants of Doubt'' is a detailed and artfully written book. He set it in the context of other books which cover the "history of manufactured ignorance":&lt;ref name="Proctor"&gt;Proctor, Robert (September–October 2010). [http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/manufactured-ignorance Book Review: Manufactured Ignorance], ''[[American Scientist]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Michaels (epidemiologist)|David Michaels]]’s ''[[Doubt is their Product]]'' (2008), [[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris Mooney]]’s ''[[The Republican War on Science]]'' (2009), [[David Rosner]] and Gerald Markowitz’s ''[[Deceit and Denial]]'' (2002), and his own book ''[[Cancer Wars]]'' (1995).&lt;ref name="Proctor" /&gt;

Robin McKie in ''[[The Guardian]]'' states that Oreskes and Conway deserve considerable praise for exposing the influence of a small group of [[Cold War]] ideologues. Their tactic of spreading doubt has confused the public about a series of key scientific issues such as global warming, even though scientists have actually become more certain about their research results. McKie says that ''Merchants of Doubt'' includes detailed notes on all sources used, is carefully paced, and is "my runaway contender for best science book of the year".&lt;ref name=Mckie8&gt;McKie, Robin (August 8, 2010). [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/08/merchants-of-doubt-oreskes-conway "Merchants of Doubt by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M Conway".] ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Reiner Grundmann]]'s review in ''[[BioSocieties]]'' journal, acknowledges that the book is well researched and factually based, but criticizes the book as being written in a black and white manner whereas historians should write a more nuanced description. The book depicts special interests and contrarians misleading the public as being mainly responsible for stopping action on policy. He says this shows a lack of basic understanding of the political process and the mechanisms of [[knowledge policy]], because the authors assume that public policy would follow on from an understanding of the science. While the book provides ''all the (formal) hallmarks of science'', Grundmann sees it less as a scholarly work than a passionate attack and overall as a problematic book.&lt;ref name="RG" /&gt;

William O’Keefe and Jeff Kueter from the [[George C. Marshall Institute]], which was founded by Seitz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Begley|first1=Sharon|title=Global Warming Deniers: A Well-Funded Machine|url=http://www.newsweek.com/global-warming-deniers-well-funded-machine-99295|website=Newsweek|date=4 August 2007|quote=...a central cog in the denial machine: the George C. Marshall Institute, a conservative think tank.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  say that although ''Merchants of Doubt'' has the appearance of a scholarly work, it discredits and undermines the reputations of people who in their lifetime contributed greatly to the American nation. They say that it does this by questioning their integrity, impugning their character, and questioning their judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=O’Keefe | first= William |last2= Kueter| first2=Jeff | date=June 2010 | url=http://marshall.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/OKeefe-and-Kueter-Clouding-the-Truth-A-Critique-of-Merchants-of-Doubt.pdf |title=Clouding the Truth: A Critique of Merchants of Doubt |publisher=[[George C.

The '''Miami accent''' is an evolving [[American English]] accent or [[sociolect]] spoken in [[South Florida]], particularly in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade]] county, originating from central [[Miami]]. The Miami accent is most prevalent in American-born Hispanic youth who live in the [[Miami metropolitan area|Greater Miami]] area.&lt;ref name="Twang"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wlrn.org/post/miami-accents-how-miamah-turned-different-sort-twang|title=Miami Accents: How 'Miamah' Turned Into A Different Sort Of Twang|first=Gabriella|last=Watts|work=wlrn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The Miami accent developed amongst second- or third-generation Miamians, particularly young adults whose first language was English, but were bilingual. Since [[World War II]], Miami's population has grown rapidly every decade, due in part to the post-war [[baby boom]]. In 1950, the [[United States Census|U.S. Census]] stated that Dade County's population was 495,084. Beginning with rapid international immigration from South American countries and the Caribbean (exacerbated by the [[Cuban exile|Cuban exodus]] of the early 1960s), Miami's population has drastically grown every decade since. Many of these immigrants began to inhabit the urban industrial area around [[Downtown Miami]]. By 1970, the census stated that Dade County's population was 1,267,792. By 2000, the population reached 2,253,362.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/05/29/miamis-spanish-speaking-p_n_104047.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Miami's Spanish-Speaking Population Outnumber English Speakers | date=2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up in Miami's urban center, second-, third-, and fourth-generation Miamians of the immigration wave of the 1960s and 1970s, developed the Miami accent.&lt;ref name="Twang"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/miami-has-a-unique-english-dialect-2013-9|title=Miami Speaks Completely Differently From The Rest Of The Country|website=businessinsider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now the customary dialect of many citizens in the Miami metropolitan area.

==Phonology==
The Miami accent is a native dialect of English, not learner English or [[interlanguage]]. It is possible to differentiate this variety from an [[interlanguage]] spoken by second-language speakers in that the Miami accent does ''not'' generally display the following features: there is no [[epenthesis|addition]] of {{IPA|/ɛ/}} before initial consonant clusters with {{IPA|/s/}}, speakers do not confuse of {{IPA|/dʒ/}} with {{IPA|/j/}}, (e.g., ''Yale'' with ''jail''), and /r/ and /rr/ are pronounced as [[Alveolar approximant|alveolar approximant &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{IPA|ɹ}}&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] instead of [[alveolar tap]] [{{IPA|ɾ}}] or [[alveolar trill]] [r] in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wlrn.org/post/miami-accents-how-miamah-turned-different-sort-twang |title=Miami Accents: How 'Miamah' Turned Into A Different Sort Of Twang|publisher=WLRN ([[WLRN-TV]] &amp; [[WLRN-FM]])|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Miami accent is based on a fairly [[General American|standard American accent]] but with some changes very similar to dialects in the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] (especially the [[New York City English|New York area dialect]], [[New Jersey English#North Jersey English|Northern New Jersey English]], and [[New York Latino English]].) Unlike Virginia Piedmont, Coastal Southern American, and Northeast American dialects (see section below), "Miami accent" is [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]]; it also incorporates a rhythm and pronunciation heavily influenced by Spanish (wherein rhythm is [[isochrony#syllable timing|syllable-timed]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2004-06-13/news/0406130047_1_cuban-accent-spanish-sound |title='Miami Accent' Takes Speakers By Surprise|work=Articles – [[Sun-Sentinel|Sun-Sentinel.com]] |date=June 13, 2004|accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phonology and sounds of the Miami accent as reported in the ''[[Miami Herald]]:''

{{quote|The difference in the Miami sound lies primarily in the vowels, which have a certain affinity with Spanish pronunciation. English has 11 different vowel sounds, while Spanish only has five. English words like "man" and "hand" include a long nasal "A" sound that doesn't exist in Spanish. Miamians now pronounce these words with a subtly Spanish shading a bit more like "mahn" and "hahnd."

Miami's "L" is a bit different from the rest of the country's, too. Miamians tend to have a slightly heavier "L" — a bit more like the Spanish "L" — than most Americans. It can be heard in the way they drag the "Ls" in "Lauderdale" or "literally."

Rhythm is also a factor. In Spanish words, all syllables are equally long, while English syllables fluctuate in length. The difference is only milliseconds, but it's enough to be noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/09/07/3609984/english-in-the-305-has-its-own.html|title=English in the 305 has its own distinct Miami sound -- The Miami Herald|website=miamiherald.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Features of the Miami accent from a report on the Miami accent from [[WLRN-FM|WLRN Radio]]:

{{quote|First, vowel pronunciation. In Spanish, there are five vowel sounds. In English, there are eleven. Thus, you have words like "hand," with the long, nasal "A" sound, pronounced more like hahnd because the long "A" does not exist in Spanish.

While most consonants sound the same in Spanish and English, the Spanish "L" is heavier, with the tongue sticking to the roof of the mouth more so than in English. This Spanish "L" pronunciation is present in Miami English.

The rhythms of the two languages are also different. In Spanish, each syllable is the same length, but in English, the syllables fluctuate in length. This is a difference in milliseconds, but they cause the rhythm of Miami English to sound a bit like the rhythm of Spanish.

Finally, "[[calque]]s" are phrases directly translated from one language to another where the translation isn't exactly idiomatic in the other language. For example, instead of saying, "let's get out of the car," someone from Miami might say, "let's get down from the car" because of the Spanish phrase "bajar del coche".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wlrn.org/post/miami-accents-how-miamah-turned-different-sort-twang|title=Miami Accents: How 'Miamah' Turned Into A Different Sort Of Twang|first=Gabriella|last=Watts|website=wlrn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Lexical characteristics==
Speakers of the Miami accent occasionally use "[[calque]]s": [[idiom]]s (that would sound awkward or unusual to other native English speakers). For example, instead of saying, "lets get out of the car," someone from Miami might say, "let's get down from the car".
Other Miami terms especially common among Miami youth, often called "[[slang]]," include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/miami-slang-glossary-pero-like-its-super-definitive-bro-6528513|title=Miami Slang Glossary: Pero Like, It's Super-Definitive, Bro|author=Kyle Munzenrieder|work=Miami New Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Chonga]]'': a particular South Florida Hispanic female fashion and associated youth. 
*"Took the light": Running a yellow light in traffic.
*"Open(ed) a hole": While most Americans say "Tear/tore a hole in" or "puncture(d)", it's literally "opened a hole" in Spanish (abrir un hueco) and Miami-accent English.  
*"Throw/threw a fart.": Resulting from the Spanish verb 'tirar' which means to throw or release. 
*"Otter Bond": The 'outer band' of a hurricane, used in Miami-accent English to describe the outer band of Hurricane Irma in 2017.
*"Drink a pill": Take a pill, a direct translation of the Spanish phrase "tomar una pastilla", because the Spanish verb "tomar" can mean either to drink or to take depending on context.
*"Come mierda": Literally "shit eater," a Spanish slang term generally equivalent to calling someone an idiot, fool or dumb ass.
*"Eating shit": Literal translation of the Spanish term "comiendo mierda" which typically means that one is not doing anything of importance.
*"Going on a mission": An exaggerated form of expressing exasperation over a difficult, time-consuming or annoying task.
*"Getty": A shortening of "get together" commonly used by Miami millenials.
*"Que bolà?": A slang term from Cuba which has no direct translation, but essentially means "What's up?"

'''Microjustice''' is the general term for the provision of basic legal services on an individual level, primarily to poor people and excluded groups.

The provided legal assistance include that people, who ask for help, are assisted by obtaining the right legal documentation, such as [[birth certificates]], house- and land registration papers and other sorts of civil documentation. With these papers, people can get access to [[education]], [[healthcare]], [[microfinance]], [[social benefits]] and it gives people the opportunity to protect their property.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/gift-to-knowledge/projects/microjustice&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Microjustice is deduced from the concept of [[microfinance]]([[Financial inclusion|inclusive finance]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.barefootlawyers.org/2008/08/microjustice4allorg-website-launched.html&lt;/ref&gt; An example of an organisation who provides microjustice services is Microjustice4all.

== Services ==
Microjustice consists of a broad variety of services, such as the provision of legal documentation, [[awareness-raising]] activities, local [[capacity building]] and evidence-based [[lobbying]]. All these activities are intended to enable people to participate in society and encourage them to be self-reliant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://microjustice4all.org/site/index.php/what-we-de/wow-we-work |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513010532/http://microjustice4all.org/site/index.php/what-we-de/wow-we-work |archivedate=2014-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7375">'''Mythos''' is the term used by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE) for the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of an [[Tragedy#Performance_of_Greek_tragedies|Athenian tragedy]]. It is the first of the six elements of tragedy that he gives.

== Variations on plot ==
“In ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' 13 and 14, Aristotle turns from the discussion of the three separate parts of the plot to a consideration of the plot as a whole composed of these three parts”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 160&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Poetics'' 13, Aristotle states his idea that the purpose of tragedy is the arousal of pity and fear.  According to Belfiore, even though Aristotle uses one set of criteria for good plots in ''Poetics'' 13 and a different set in ''Poetics'' 14, “these two accounts are more consistent with one another than is often thought”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 161&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle defines plot in chapter 13 of ''Poetics'' as a variation of two different “change types” and three different “character types”.  A tragic plot is a movement or change between the end points of good and bad fortune, because of that there are two possible kinds of change: change that begins in good fortune and ends in bad fortune, and change that begins in bad fortune and ends in good fortune.  The three possible “character types” are the characters of “decent” people, people “outstanding in excellence and justice”; “evil people”; and the “in-between man”.  Of the six logically possible outcomes, Aristotle lists only four.  Aristotle contends in ''Poetics'' 13 that the most desirable plot involves ‘An in-between person who changes from good to bad fortune, due to [[hamartia]], “error.”  Additionally, Aristotle states that the plot in which ‘An evil person changes from bad to good fortune,’ is the most untragic of all because it is not philanthropic, pitiable, or fearful.’  ''Poetics'' 13 deals with good and bad combinations of character types and change. Conversely, ''Poetics'' 14 discusses good and bad combinations of a pathos with the knowledge or ignorance of the agent.  “Ranked from worst to best, by Aristotle, these are the four logical possibilities of [[pathos]]:

1. A pathos is about to occur, with knowledge, but does not occur.

2. A pathos occurs, with knowledge.

3. A pathos occurs, in ignorance.

4. A pathos is about to occur, in ignorance, but does not occur”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 171&lt;/ref&gt;

The emotional effect peculiar to the tragic action is therefore that of promoting the experience of feelings such as pity and terror, which constitute the ultimate end at which the representation of the mythos aims.&lt;ref name="Rizzoli 11"&gt;Rizzoli 11&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aristotle's mythos vs. the modern interpretation of plot ==
Aristotle’s notion of mythos in ''Poetics'' differs from the modern interpretation of plot most prominently in its role in drama. According to Elizabeth Belfiore’s ''Tragic Pleasures; Aristotle on Plot and Emotion'', Aristotle believed that “plot is essential to tragedy, ethos [character] is second to plot”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore, Elizabeth. "Narratological Plots and Aristotle's Mythos." Arethusa 33 (2000): 37-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believes that “psychological and ethical considerations are secondary to the events themselves”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 40&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle’s view focuses nearly all of his attention on the events of the plot, which, in turn, leaves the characters to become merely conveyors of situations rather than humans with convictions and motives. According to [[Meir Sternberg]], Aristotle “restricts the well-made epic or play to a ‘whole’ (holos) action, with ‘beginning, middle, and end’ linked throughout by necessary or probable sequence, so that nothing will follow its cutoff point”&lt;ref&gt;[[Meir Sternberg|Sternberg, Meir]]. "Universals of Narrative and Their Cognitivist Fortunes (II)." ''[[Poetics Today]]'' 24 (2003): 517-638.&lt;/ref&gt;). Aristotle’s definition of plot states that every event portrayed and every action taken is a logical progression from previous events.  Aristotle’s focuses on mythos (plot) as opposed to a focus on ethos (character) or “conflict either in the sense of struggle within a person or in the sense of the clashing of opposed principles”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 64&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle explains that tragedy imitates the actions and lives of human beings rather than human beings themselves.&lt;ref&gt;1450.a:16-17&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle concerns himself with the universally logical events of a plot, rather than the specific and often illogical conflicts between characters associated with those events.

[[German idealism|German idealist]] philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]] believed that tragedy consists of the conflicts between each character’s ethical justification and the resolution toward a greater rational good.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, Mark W. "Introduction to Hegel's Theory of Tragedy." PhaenEx 1 (2006): 11-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel’s viewpoint places character conflict as the central focus of tragedy, in clear contradiction to Aristotle’s plot-centric theory of tragedy. According to Meir Sternberg, modernist dramatic theory endorses the “open ending, and poststructuralism for preaching endless indeterminacy,” which is most noticeable in the modern absurdist theater.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg 519&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, Sternberg asserts that Aristotle’s viewpoint directs all complex endings and forms of closure into simple cause-and-effect sequences.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg 524&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, many of Aristotle’s conclusions directly oppose those of twentieth century narratologists such as [[Vladimir Propp]], who “reverses Aristotle's theory that ‘tragedy is imitation not of human beings but of actions,’ by writing that stories are about characters who act”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 45&lt;/ref&gt; Propp also argues that basic story elements, which he defines as functions, “are in fact ethically colored, either in themselves or because they are defined in terms of a character who has specific ethical qualities”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 46&lt;/ref&gt; Propp’s viewpoint directly conflicts with that of Aristotle in ''Poetics'' because Aristotle states that drama consists of a logical sequence of events that is not affected by ethical dilemmas.

'''New Appalachia''' is the concept that the quality of life in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] of [[California]] is comparable or worse than the traditionally impoverished [[Appalachia]] region of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and therefore shares similar hardships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://migration.ucdavis.edu/rmn/more.php?id=1077_0_2_0] ''San Joaquin Valley: New Appalachia?''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

The San Joaquin Valley consists of the southern half of the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]], between the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta]] in the north and the [[Tehachapi Mountains]] in the south.

==Access==

Insufficient access to medicine in the United States, in particular prenatal and preventive care, is typified by both rural and inner city communities.  Early and adequate access to prenatal care is important to maternal and child health and is another comparative indicator of community health.  According to the California Department of Health Services, 37% of births in [[Merced County, California|Merced County]] occurred with no or late prenatal care and the San Joaquin Valley average was 19.5% of births with no or late prenatal care.  By comparison, the California average was 13.6% of births and the national average was 10% of births&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.ca.gov/crb/05/07/05-007.pdf] ''San Joaquin Valley: Land, People, and Economy''&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the counties of the San Joaquin Valley have relatively high ratios of population to physicians, suggesting relatively low access, with the highest in [[Kings County, California|Kings County]] at 1,027 patients per a physician, the San Joaquin Valley average at approximately 671 patients per a physician and the California average of 400 patients per a physician.&lt;ref&gt;San Joaquin Valley: Land, People, and Economy. http://www.library.ca.gov/crb/05/07/05-007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Another measure of access is licensed acute care hospital beds per thousand population, where the Kings County average of 1.1 beds per a thousand and the San Joaquin Valley average of 1.8 beds per a thousand were again less than the state average of 2.1 bed per a thousand.&lt;ref&gt;San Joaquin Valley: Land, People, and Economy. http://www.library.ca.gov/crb/05/07/05-007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently the age adjusted death rate is significantly higher than the rest of California.

==Response==
In response the [[University of California]] with the [[University of California, Merced]] is exploring opening a research medical school specializing in rural care, in hopes that some graduates will settle in the San Joaquin Valley and provide better healthcare&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucmerced.edu/news_articles/09152010_uc_merced_and_uc.asp] ''UC Merced and UC Davis Partner to Begin Educating Medical Students in the Valley''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poverty==
Moreover the poverty rate for persons under the age of 18 was as high as 32% in [[Tulare County, California|Tulare County]] and 25.6% in the San Joaquin Valley, compared to 19% in California as a whole.

==Quality of life==
In 2011 ''Forbes,'' after taking the fluctuation of median home values, five of the top twenty "most miserable cities" were located in the San Joaquin Valley.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2011/02/02/stockton-miami-cleveland-business-washington-miserable-cities.html] ''America's Most Miserable Cities''&lt;/ref&gt;  Aside from the collapse of median home values, persistent crime, unemployment and poverty were common factors between [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], [[Merced, California|Merced]], [[Modesto, California|Modesto]] and [[Stockton, California|Stockton]]; every major city of the San Joaquin Valley.

'''Olaus''' or '''Olof Verelius''' (12 February 1618 &amp;ndash; 3 January 1682) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] scholar of Northern antiquities who published the first edition of a [[saga]] and the first [[Old Norse]]-[[Swedish language|Swedish]] dictionary and is held to have been the founder of the Hyperborean School which led to [[Gothicism]].

==Life and career==
He was born in Häsleby parish in [[Jönköping County]], to the pastor Nicolaus Petri and his wife, Botilda Olofsdotter, but adopted the surname Verelius in his youth.&lt;ref name=Annerstedt1216&gt;C. Annerstedt, "Verēlius, Olof",  ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'', 1926, cols. 1216&amp;ndash;17, col. 1216, [http://runeberg.org/nfck/0640.html online] at [[Project Runeberg]] {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at Dorpat (now [[Tartu]], Estonia) in 1633 and [[Uppsala]] in 1638, was given a position as tutor to youths of noble birth by [[Axel Oxenstierna]], and in 1648&amp;ndash;50 took a tour abroad on which he made a speech in [[Leiden]] about the [[Peace of Westphalia]] and in Paris on the occasion of the coronation of [[Christina, Queen of Sweden|Queen Christina]].&lt;ref name=Annerstedt1216/&gt;

Verelius was named to a professorship of Rhetoric at [[University of Tartu|Dorpat]] in 1652 but never took it up; instead, in 1653 he became steward of the academy at Uppsala, a position which he held until 1657, when he took a teaching position in history. In 1662 he took up the [[Chair (academic)|chair]] in Swedish antiquities at [[Uppsala University]] which had been created especially for him.&lt;ref name=Annerstedt1216/&gt; In 1666 he also became national archivist, and assessor in the newly founded College of Antiquaries ({{lang-sv|Antikvitetskollegium}}).&lt;ref name=Annerstedt1216/&gt;&lt;ref name=Annales28&gt;Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, ''Annales'' 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=aYZnTv-YOdPTiALfn8n9CQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=Tb3aAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Olof+Verelius&amp;q=Antikvitets+kollegium#search_anchor p. 28].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1675 and 1679 respectively, he resigned those positions.&lt;ref name=Annerstedt1216/&gt; In 1679, while retaining his professorship, he became university librarian.&lt;ref name=Annerstedt1216/&gt; He died in Uppsala on 3 January 1682.

==Works==
The Icelandic student Jón Rúgman Jónsson, who had been intending to study in [[Copenhagen]] but ended up in Sweden, had brought a number of saga texts to Uppsala; he had copied them as leisure reading.&lt;ref&gt;Henrik Williams, "Förnyad filologi: Filologins rötter", in ''Omodernt: Människor och tankar i förmodern tid'', ed.

In 1675, he published a handbook of Swedish [[Runes|runic]] inscriptions, in Latin and Swedish, ''Manuductio ad runographiam''.&lt;ref name=Annerstedt1217/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Nordic Languages: An International Handbook of the History of the North Germanic Languages'', ed. Oskar Bandle ''et al'', Handbücher zur Sprach- und Kommunikationswissenschaft 22, volume 1 Berlin: de Gruyter, 2002, {{ISBN|978-3-11-014876-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RqkBXIJkkuEC&amp;pg=PA359&amp;dq=Verelius+also+published+a+handbook+on+ancient+Swedish&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2ZofT975OOqa2gWrt6WlDw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Verelius&amp;f=false p. 359].&lt;/ref&gt; This continued [[Johannes Bureus]]' research into the runes and was a significant work, although limited by, for example, the assumption that the runes could be derived from the Greek alphabet.&lt;ref name=historia267/&gt;

On his return from his foreign tour, Verelius had written ''Epitomarum Historiæ Svio-Gothicæ libri quattuor et Gothorum extra patrium gestarum libri duo'', a highly patriotic view of ancient Swedish history. This was published in 1730 and became popular as a reader because of its good Latin.&lt;ref name=Annerstedt1216/&gt;

==Views and controversies==
Verelius is counted the founder of the Hyperborean School in Swedish scholarship, which took the view that the Goths of [[Gotland]] were the people referred to as [[Hyperboreans]] in Greek literature; this gave rise to [[Gothicism]] and Verelius' student Rudbeck became its most prominent proponent.&lt;ref name=Annerstedt1216/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Nordic Languages'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=RqkBXIJkkuEC&amp;pg=PA358&amp;dq=Verelius+was+the+initiator+of+the+Hyperborean+School&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c5gfT6bJNYri2QXWmqSxDw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Verelius%20was%20the%20initiator%20of%20the%20Hyperborean%20School&amp;f=false p. 358].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adolph Burnett Benson, ''The Old Norse Element in Swedish Romanticism'', Columbia University Germanic Studies, New York: Columbia University, 1914, {{OCLC|16957175}}, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=L6kLAAAAIAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=verelius+julie&amp;ots=xLBYJq0Kfc&amp;sig=KR-GxYIS3lnQ1lM5jV5HzSqUMr4#v=onepage&amp;q=1672&amp;f=false p. 21]: "and it was from [Verelius] that Rudbeck received the impetus for his work."&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1672 to 1681 he and [[Johannes Schefferus]] disputed bitterly over the site of the [[Norse paganism|heathen]] [[temple at Uppsala]].&lt;ref name=Annerstedt1217/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrik Hall, ''The Social Construction of Nationalism: Sweden as an Example'', Lund political studies 106, Lund: Lund University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|978-91-7966-525-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=kUQgT-XQJaOQiQKqypm4Cw&amp;id=RYkUAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Verelius+Schefferus+Uppsala&amp;q=But+the+discursively+articulated+struggle+was+the+one+between+Verelius+and+Schefferus+regarding+the+location+of+Uppsala+pagan+temple%2C+according+to+Lindroth+%281975%3A+311%2C+see+also+Annerstedt+1891%29+the+harshest+feud+in+the+Swedish+history#search_anchor p. 161].&lt;/ref&gt; Schefferus argued in ''Upsalia'', published in 1666, that the temple had been located in the centre of the modern town.&lt;ref name=King177&gt;David King, ''Finding Atlantis: A True Story of Genius, Madness and an Extraordinary Quest'', New York: Harmony, 2005, {{ISBN|978-1-4000-4752-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MqZNgfZt47wC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=Schefferus+Verelius+templet+Gamla+Uppsala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=im0gT-CRLuOSiAKm_4XcCw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Schefferus%20Verelius%20templet%20Gamla%20Uppsala&amp;f=false p. 177].&lt;/ref&gt; Verelius disputed this in his notes to ''Hervarar saga'', arguing that the temple had been on the site of the church at [[Gamla Uppsala]].&lt;ref name=historia267/&gt;&lt;ref name=King177/&gt; In 1678, Verelius published excerpts from ''Bishop Karl's Chronicle'' in support of his view, but the document was a forgery, although Verelius and Rudbeck may not have known this.&lt;ref&gt;Olof Sundqvist, ''Freyr's Offspring: Rulers and Religion in Ancient Svea Society'', 	Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis, Historia religionum 21, Uppsala: Universitet, 2002, {{ISBN|978-91-554-5263-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=im0gT-CRLuOSiAKm_4XcCw&amp;id=1-IoAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Schefferus+Verelius+templet+Gamla+Uppsala&amp;q=Schefferus#search_anchor pp. 299&amp;ndash;300].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MqZNgfZt47wC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=Schefferus+Verelius+templet+Gamla+Uppsala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=im0gT-CRLuOSiAKm_4XcCw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=No%20wonder%20questions%20have%20been%20raised&amp;f=false 182],  [https://books.google.com/books?id=MqZNgfZt47wC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=Schefferus+Verelius+templet+Gamla+Uppsala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=im0gT-CRLuOSiAKm_4XcCw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=innocent&amp;f=false 185].&lt;/ref&gt; In any event Verelius' view, although based less on sober scholarship than Schefferus'&amp;mdash;he considered the tower of the church at Gamla Uppsala to predate Christianity and be identical with the heathen temple&amp;mdash;&lt;ref&gt;Henrik Janson, "Äkta förfalskning åter bevismaterial.

The '''omphalos hypothesis''' is one attempt to reconcile the scientific evidence that the [[Age of the universe|universe is billions of years old]] with the [[Genesis creation narrative]], which implies that the Earth is only a few thousand years old.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is based on the religious belief that the universe was created by a divine being, within the past ten thousand years (in keeping with [[flood geology]]), and that the presence of objective, verifiable evidence that the universe is older than approximately ten millennia is entirely due to the creator introducing [[false evidence]] that makes the universe appear much, much older.

The idea was named after the title of an 1857 book, ''[[Omphalos (book)|Omphalos]]'' by [[Philip Henry Gosse]], in which Gosse argued that in order for the world to be "functional", [[God]] must have created the [[Earth]] with mountains and canyons, trees with growth rings, Adam and Eve with hair, fingernails, and [[navel]]s&lt;ref name="Gardner2000"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=z1NdAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Did Adam and Eve Have Navels?: Debunking Pseudoscience|last=Gardner|first=Martin|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2000|isbn=9780393322385|place=New York|pages=7–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ὀμφαλός ''[[omphalos]]'' is [[Greek language|Greek]] for "navel"), and that therefore ''no'' [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] evidence about the [[age of the Earth]] or [[age of the universe|universe]] can be taken as reliable.

&lt;!-- The omphalos hypothesis is a hypothesis in the sense of [[formal logic]], rather than a [[scientific hypothesis]].{{says who|date=April 2018}}  The term denotes the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] or ''hypothesis'' of a logical [[proposition]].{{clarify|date=April 2018|reason=What exactly is the antecedent here? "If one attempts to reconcile..."? And what is the consequent? ??}}  In this case, the proposition has two logical outcomes:  either the Earth is more than 10,000 years old, or the objective physical evidence of the universe's age is false.{{clarify|date=April 2018|reason=What does it mean for a statement to be the "outcome" of a proposition? Propositions are supposed to have truth values.}} --&gt;
Various supporters of [[Young Earth creationism]] have given different explanations for their belief that the universe is filled with false evidence of the universe's age, including a belief that some things needed to be created at a certain age for the ecosystems to function, or their belief that the creator was deliberately planting deceptive evidence.

The idea was widely rejected in the 19th century, when Gosse published his book.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.roizen.com/ron/omph.htm|title=The rejection of Omphalos: a note on shifts in the intellectual hierarchy of mid-nineteenth century Britain|last=Roizen|first=Ron|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|year=1982|volume=21|pages=365–369|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219011828/http://www.roizen.com/ron/omph.htm|archivedate=2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It saw some revival in the 20th century by some Young Earth creationists, who extended the argument to include visible light that appears to originate in far-off [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]].

==Development of the idea==

=== Pre-scientific sources ===
Stories of the beginning of human life based on the [[creation story in Genesis]] have been published for centuries. The 4th-century theologian [[Ephrem the Syrian]] described a world in which divine creation instantly produced fully grown organisms:

{{quote|Although the grasses were only a moment old at their creation, they appeared as if they were months old. Likewise, the trees, although only a day old when they sprouted forth, were nevertheless like ... years old as they were fully grown and fruits were already budding on their branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=St. [[Ephrem the Syrian]]: Selected Prose Works|series=The Fathers of the Church|volume=91|editor=Kathleen McVey|publisher=Catholic University of America|year=1994|isbn=978-0-8132-1421-4|chapter=Commentary on Genesis.

=== 19th-century thinkers ===
By the 19th century, scientific evidence of the Earth's age had been collected, and it disagreed with a literal reading of the biblical accounts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This evidence was rejected by some writers at the time, such as [[François-René de Chateaubriand]].  Chateaubriand wrote in his 1802 book, ''[[Génie du christianisme]]'' (Part I Book IV Chapter V) that "God might have created, and doubtless did create, the world with all the marks of antiquity and completeness which it now exhibits."  In modern times, Rabbi [[Dovid Gottlieb]] supported a similar position, saying that the objective scientific evidence for an old universe is strong, but wrong, and that the traditional Jewish calendar is correct.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb, [http://www.dovidgottlieb.com/comments/AGEOFTHEUNIVERSE.htm "The Age of the Universe"].  "The solution to the contradiction between the age of the earth and the universe according to science and the Jewish date of 5755 years since Creation is this: the real age of the universe is 5755 years, but it has misleading evidence of greater age."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 19th century, the disagreement between scientific evidence about the age of the Earth and the Western religious traditions was a significant debate among intellectuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Gosse published ''[[Omphalos (book)|Omphalos]]'' in 1857 to explain his answer to this question.  He concluded that the religious tradition was correct.  Gosse began with the earlier idea that the Earth contained mature organisms at the instant they were created, and that these organisms had false signs of their development, such as hair on mammals, which grows over time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He extended this idea of creating a single mature organism to creating mature systems, and concluded that [[fossil]]s were an artifact of the creation process and merely part of what was necessary to make creation work.  Therefore, he reasoned, fossils and other signs of the Earth's age could not be used to prove the age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  His book sold poorly and was widely rejected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other contemporary proposals for reconciling the stories of creation in Genesis with the scientific evidence included the ''interval theory'' or [[Gap creationism|gap theory of creation]], in which a large interval of time passed in between the initial creation of the universe and the beginning of the [[Six Days of Creation|six days of creation]].  This idea was put forward by Archbishop [[John Bird Sumner]] of Canterbury in ''Treatise on the Records of Creation''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Another popular idea, promoted by the English theologian [[John Pye-Smith|John Pye Smith]], was that the Garden of Eden described the events of only one small location.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A third proposal, by French naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]], held that [[Day-age creationism|the six "days" of the creation story were arbitrary and large ages]] rather than 24-hour periods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Theologians rejected Gosse's proposal on the grounds that it seemed to make the divine creator tell lies – either lying in the scriptures, or lying in nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Scientists rejected it on the grounds that it disagreed with [[uniformitarianism]], an explanation of geology that was widely supported at the time, and the impossibility of testing or falsifying the idea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Modern creationists ===
Some modern creationists still argue against scientific evidence in the same way. For instance, [[John D. Morris]], president of the [[Institute for Creation Research]] wrote in 1990 about the "appearance of age":
{{quote|When Adam was created, he no doubt looked like a mature adult, fully able to walk, talk, care for the garden, etc. When God created fruit trees, they were already bearing fruit. In each case, what He created was functionally complete right from the start—able to fulfill the purpose for which it was created. Stars, created on Day Four, had to be seen to perform their purpose of usefulness in telling time; therefore, their light had to be visible on Earth right from the start.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|title=Did God Create with Appearance of Age?|first=John D.|last=Morris|year= 1990|journal=Acts &amp; Facts |volume=19 |issue=9|url=http://www.icr.org/article/1088/305/|accessdate=14 Feb 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He does not extend this idea to the geological record, preferring to believe that it was all created in the Flood, but others such as Gerald E. Aardsma go further, with his idea of "virtual history". This appears to suggest that events after the creation have changed the "virtual history" we now see, including the fossils:
{{quote|
This raises one more major point of difference, the handling of the Fall. Briefly, Creation with Appearance of Age runs into a theological snag with things like fossils of fish with other smaller fish in their stomachs: "Do you mean that God chose to paint, of all things, a facade of SUFFERING and DEATH onto the creation when He gave it this arbitrary appearance of age at the time of creation?" The virtual history paradigm recognizes simply that all creation type miracles entail a virtual history, so the Fall, with its creation type miracles (by which the nature of the creation was changed—"subjected to futility") carried with it its own (fallen) virtual history, which is the virtual history we now see. We do not see the original utopian pre-Fall creation with its (presumably utopian) virtual history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Correspondence: Virtual History|first=Gerald E.|last=Aardsma|url=http://www.biblicalchronologist.org/correspondence/virtual_history.php|accessdate=13 Feb 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The past president of the Missouri Association for Creation has said:
{{quote|
The appearance of age in the things which God created is a much-debated issue in contemporary Christian scientific circles. Can God—or more accurately—would God create something which at the very moment of its creation has the appearance of age? The short answer to this question may be: How Else? How, indeed, could God create anything that did not appear to us to be aged (like a fine wine) at the moment of its creation&amp;nbsp;... Maybe you thought of a visible star—depending on its distance from the earth, its light might appear to have been traveling for over a billion years to reach your eyes. All of these things would have the appearance of age and an ongoing process at the very moment of their creation.&lt;ref&gt;

==Criticisms{{anchor|Last_Thursdayism}}==

===When did false history begin?===
Though Gosse's original omphalos hypothesis specifies a popular creation story, others have proposed that the idea does not preclude creation as recently as five minutes ago, including memories of times before this created ''[[in situ]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Wilcox, ''God and Evolution:A Faith-Based Understanding'', Valley Forge, PA: Judson Press, 2004, 30,&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is sometimes called '''Last Thursdayism''' by its opponents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Counter-creationism Handbook|last=Isaac|first=Mark|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2007|isbn=9780520249264|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in "the world might as well have been created last Thursday."

The concept is both unverifiable and [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] through any conceivable scientific study—in other words, it is impossible even ''in principle'' to subject it to any form of test, by reference to any [[empirical data]], because the empirical data themselves are considered to have been arbitrarily created to look the way they do at every observable level of detail.

===A deceptive creator===
From a religious viewpoint, it can be interpreted as God having "created a fake", such as illusions of light in space of stellar explosions ([[supernovae]]) that never really happened, or [[volcano|volcanic]] [[mountains]] that were never really volcanoes in the first place and that never actually experienced erosion.

This conception has therefore drawn harsh rebuke from some theologians. Reverend Canon [[Brian Hebblethwaite]]&lt;!-- WAIT--WAIT! Before you remove the brackets, consider writing a new article! -- Paine --&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=245 Reverend Canon Brian Hebblethwaite], biography online at www.GiffordLectures.org&lt;/ref&gt; for example, preached against [[Bertrand Russell|Bertrand Russell's]] Five-minute hypothesis:&lt;ref name=russell5 /&gt;
{{quotation|Bertrand Russell wrote, in ''The Analysis of Mind'': "There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a population that 'remembered' a wholly unreal past.".&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, Analysis of Mind, London, ([1921]1924), p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The basis for Hebblethwaite's objection, however, is the presumption of a God that would not deceive people about their very humanity—an unprovable presumption that the omphalos hypothesis rejects at the outset. Hebblethwaite also suggests that God necessarily had to create certain elements of the Universe in combination with the creation of man:

{{quotation|To be an adult human being, we have to have gone through a real process of growth and nurture and a real history of interpersonal relation in a real and specific culture. One can even suggest that it is necessary for the Creator to have fashioned us in and through a whole evolving physical universe. As, again, Austin Farrer put it, "if God wished to make no more than any single one of us, he would need to make half a universe. And why? Because no one of us would be the creature he is, if a thousand thousand lines of converging history, both physical and personal, had not met in him. Your life or mine is but a half-sentence in the book of the world. Tear it from its place, and it cannot be read; or if it can be read, it signifies nothing".&lt;ref name="Reverend Canon Brian Hebblethwaite"&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/files/christchair/Hebblethwaite%20In%20Defence%20of%20Christianity.pdf Reverend Canon Brian Hebblethwaite], In Defence of Christianity March 6, 2005, p. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=[[Brian Hebblethwaite]]|source=}}

In a rebuttal of the claim that God might have implanted a false history of the age of the Universe in order to test our faith in the truth of the Torah, [[Natan Slifkin|Rabbi Natan Slifkin]], an author whose works have been banned by several [[Haredi]] rabbis for going against the tenets of the [[Talmud]],&lt;ref&gt;G.

Dei'ah veDibur, January 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; writes:

{{quotation|God essentially created two conflicting accounts of Creation: one in nature, and one in the [[Torah]]. How can it be determined which is the real story, and which is the fake designed to mislead us? One could equally propose that it is nature which presents the real story, and that the Torah was devised by God to test us with a fake history!

One has to be able to rely on God's truthfulness if religion is to function. Or, to put it another way—if God went to enormous lengths to convince us that the world is billions of years old, who are we to disagree?&lt;ref&gt;Slifkin, p167&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Five-minute hypothesis===
The '''five-minute hypothesis''' is a [[skeptical hypothesis]] put forth by the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] that proposes that the universe sprang into existence five minutes ago from nothing, with human [[memory]] and all other signs of history included. It is a commonly used example of how one may maintain extreme [[philosophical skepticism]] with regard to memory.&lt;ref name=russell5&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Russell | first1 = Bertrand | authorlink1 = Bertrand Russell | title = Analysis of Mind | year = 1921 | publisher = G.

{{Islamic culture}}

An '''oriental rug''' is a heavy textile, made for a wide variety of utilitarian and symbolic purpose, produced in “[[Orient|Oriental countries]]” for home use, local sale, and export.

Oriental carpets can be [[knotted-pile carpet|pile]] woven or [[Kilim|flat woven]] without pile, using various materials such as silk, wool, and cotton. Examples range in size from pillow to large, room-sized carpets, and include carrier bags, floor coverings, decorations for animals, Islamic [[prayer rug]]s (''sajjadah''), Jewish Torah ark covers (''[[parochet]]''), and Christian altar covers. Since the [[High Middle Ages]], oriental rugs have been an integral part of their cultures of origin, as well as of the European and, later on, the North American culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denny|first1=Walter B.|title=How to Read Islamic carpets|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-1-58839-540-5|pages=9–10|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographically, oriental rugs are made in an area referred to as the “Rug Belt”, which stretches from Morocco across North Africa, the Middle East, and into Central Asia and northern India. It includes countries such as northern [[China]], [[Tibet]], [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], the [[Maghreb]] in the west, the [[Caucasus]] in the north, and [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in the south. People from different cultures, countries, racial groups and religious faiths are involved in the production of oriental rugs. Since many of these countries lie in an area which today is referred to as the [[Islamic world]], oriental rugs are often also called “'''Islamic Carpets'''”,&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denny|first1=Walter B.|title=How to Read Islamic carpets|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-1-58839-540-5|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term “oriental rug” is used mainly for convenience.

== The origin of the knotted pile rug ==
[[File:Scythiancarpet.jpg|thumb|Border of the [[Pazyryk burials#Pazyryk carpet|Pazyryk Carpet]], circa 400 BC.]]
The beginning of carpet weaving remains unknown, as carpets are subject to use, deterioration, and destruction by insects and rodents. There is little archaeological evidence to support any theory about the origin of the pile-woven carpet. The earliest surviving carpet fragments are spread over a wide geographic area, and a long time span. Woven rugs probably developed from earlier floor coverings, made of [[felt]], or a technique known as “extra-weft wrapping”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Emery|first1=Irene|title=The primary structures of fabrics : an illustrated classification|date=2009|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0500288023|edition=Pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinner|first1=R.|title=The First Carpets|journal=Hali|date=1983|volume=5|issue=2|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat-woven rugs are made by tightly interweaving the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] and [[weft]] strands of the weave to produce a flat surface with no pile. The technique of weaving carpets further developed into a technique known as extra-weft wrapping weaving, a technique which produces [[Soumak rug|soumak]], and loop woven textiles. Loop weaving is done by pulling the weft strings over a gauge rod, creating loops of thread facing the weaver. The rod is then either removed, leaving the loops closed, or the loops are cut over the protecting rod, resulting in a rug very similar to a genuine pile rug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cootner|first1=Cathryn|editor1-last=Cootner|editor1-first=Cathryn|editor1-link=Flat woven textiles|title=Flat-weaves and knotted-pile: An historical and structural overview|date=1981|publisher=Textile Museum|location=Washington, D.C., U.S.A.|isbn=9780874050189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, hand-woven [[pile rug]]s are produced by knotting strings of thread individually into the warps, cutting the thread after each single knot. The fabric is then further stabilized by weaving (“shooting”) in one or more strings of weft, and compacted by beating with a comb. It seems likely that knotted-pile carpets have been produced by people who were already familiar with extra-weft wrapping techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wertime|first1=J|title=A new approach to the structural analysis of pile rugs.|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1983|volume=3|issue=3|pages=12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical evidence from ancient sources ===
Probably the oldest existing texts referring to carpets are preserved in [[cuneiform]] writing on [[clay tablet]]s from the royal archives of the kingdom of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], from the 2nd millennium BC. The [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word for rug is ''mardatu'', and specialist rug weavers referred to as ''kāşiru'' are distinguished from other specialized professions like sack-makers (''sabsu'' or ''sabsinnu'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Soden|first1=Wolfram|last2=Schley (transl.)|first2=Donald G.|title=The ancient Orient: an introduction to the study of the ancient Near East|date=1993|publisher=W.B.

There are documentary records of carpets being used by the ancient Greeks. [[Homer]] writes in [[Ilias]] XVII,350 that the body of Patroklos is covered with a “splendid carpet”. In [[Odyssey]] Book VII and X “carpets” are mentioned.

Around 400 BC, the Greek author [[Xenophon]] mentions “carpets” in his book “[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]”:

{{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;"αὖθις δὲ Τιμασίωνι τῷ Δαρδανεῖ προσελθών, ἐπεὶ ἤκουσεν αὐτῷ εἶναι καὶ ἐκπώματα καὶ τάπιδας βαρβαρικάς" [Xen. anab. VII.3.18]
: ''Next he went to Timasion the Dardanian, for he heard that he had some Persian drinking cups and carpets.''

[[Pliny the Elder]] wrote in ([[Natural History (Pliny)|nat. VIII, 48]]) that carpets (“polymita”) were invented in Alexandria. It is unknown whether these were flatweaves or pile weaves, as no detailed technical information is provided in the texts. Already the earliest known written sources refer to carpets as gifts given to, or required from, high-ranking persons.

=== Pazyryk: The first surviving pile rug ===

The oldest known hand knotted rug which is nearly completely preserved, and can, therefore, be fully evaluated in every technical and design aspect is the [[Pazyryk carpet]], dated to the 5th century BC. It was discovered in the late 1940s by the Russian archeologist Sergei Rudenko and his team.&lt;ref name="Frozen Tombs of Siberia"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rudenko|first1=S.J.|last2=Thompson|first2=M.W.

The design of the carpet already shows the basic arrangement of what was to become the standard oriental carpet design: A field with repeating patterns, framed by a main border in elaborate design, and several secondary borders.

=== Fragments from Turkestan, Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan ===
[[File:Textile fragment from Loulan Xinjiang China.jpg|thumb|Carpet fragment, [[Loulan Kingdom|Loulan]], Xinjiang province, China, dated to 3rd-4th century AD. [[British Museum]], London]]
The explorer [[Mark Aurel Stein]] found flat-woven [[kilim]]s dating to at least the fourth or fifth century AD in [[Turpan]], East Turkestan, China, an area which still produces carpets today. Rug fragments were also found in the [[Lop Nur]] area, and are woven in symmetrical knots, with 5-7 interwoven wefts after each row of knots, with a striped design, and various colours. They are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.&lt;ref name="Spuhler Carpets Islamic Museum Berlin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spuhler|first1=Friedrich|title=Die Orientteppiche im Museum für Islamische Kunst Berlin|date=1987|publisher=Klinkhardt and Biermann|location=Munich|isbn=3-7814-0270-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpet fragments dated to the third or fourth century BC were excavated from burial mounds at Bashadar in the [[Ongudai|Ongudai District]], [[Altai Republic]], [[Russia]] by S. Rudenko, the discoverer of the Pazyryk carpet. They show a fine weave of about 4650 asymmetrical [[knot density|knots per]] square decimeter&lt;ref name="Rudenko"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rudenko|first1=S.J.|last2=Thompson|first2=M.W.

Other fragments woven in symmetrical as well as asymmetrical knots have been found in [[Dura-Europos]] in [[Syria]],&lt;ref name="Dura-Europos"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pfister|first1=R.|last2=Bellinger|first2=L.|title=The Excavations at Dura-Europos; IV Vol. 2 The Textiles|date=1945|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the At-Tar caves in [[Iraq]],&lt;ref name="At-Tar"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fujii|first1=Hideo|last2=Sakamoto|first2=Kazuko|editor1-last=Eiland|editor1-first=M.L.|title=The marked characteristics of carpets unearthed from the At-Tar caves, Iraq|journal=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies|date=1993|volume=IV|pages=35–40|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; dated to the first centuries AD.

These rare findings demonstrate that all the skills and techniques of dyeing and carpet weaving were already known in western Asia before the first century AD.

Fragments of pile rugs from findspots in north-eastern [[Afghanistan]], reportedly originating from the province of [[Samangan Province|Samangan]], have been carbon-14 dated to a time span from the turn of the second century to the early [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] period. Among these fragments, some show depictings of animals, like various stags (sometimes arranged in a procession, recalling the design of the Pazyryk carpet) or a winged mythical creature. Wool is used for warp, weft, and pile, the yarn is crudely spun, and the fragments are woven with the asymmetric knot associated with Persian and far-eastern carpets. Every three to five rows, pieces of unspun wool, strips of cloth and leather are woven in.&lt;ref name="Carpets from Islamic Lands"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spuhler|first1=Friedrich|title=Carpets from Islamic Lands|date=2012|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-97043-0|pages=14–19|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fragments are now in the [[House of Sabah|Al-Sabah]] Collection in the Dar al-Athar al-Islamyya, [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name="darmuseum.org.kw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kuwait Dar al-Athar al-Islamyya rugs and textiles collection|url=http://darmuseum.org.kw/the-collections/rugs-textiles/|website=http://darmuseum.org.kw/|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spuhler, Pre-Islamic carpets 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spuhler|first1=Friedrich|title=Pre-Islamic carpets and textiles from eastern lands.|date=2013|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=Farnborough|isbn=9780500970546|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 13th–14th century: The Konya and Fostat fragments; findings from Tibetan monasteries ===

In the early fourteenth century, [[Marco Polo]] wrote in the account of his [[The Travels of Marco Polo|travels]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...et ibi fiunt soriani et tapeti pulchriores de mundo et pulchrioris coloris.''&lt;br&gt;
"...and here they make the most beautiful silks and carpets in the world, and with the most beautiful colours."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marsden|first1=William|editor1-last=Wright|editor1-first=Thomas|title=Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian: the translation of Marsden revised.|date=2010|publisher=Bibliobazaar, Llc|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1142126261|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coming from Persia, Polo travelled from Sivas to Kayseri. [[Abu'l-Fida]], citing [[Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi]] refers to carpet export from Anatolian cities in the lte 13th century: “That's where Turkoman carpets are made, which are exported to all other countries”. He and the Moroccan merchant [[Ibn Battuta]] mention Aksaray as a major rug weaving center in the early-to-mid-14th century.

Pile woven Turkish carpets were found in [[Konya]] and [[Beyşehir]] in Turkey, and [[Fustat|Fostat]] in Egypt, and were dated to the 13th century, which corresponds to the Anatolian [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuq]] Period (1243–1302). Eight fragments were found in 1905 by F.R. Martin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=F.R.|title=A History of Oriental Carpets before 1800|date=1908|publisher=Printed for the author in the I. and R. State and Court Print|location=Vienna|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Alâeddin Mosque]] in Konya, four in the [[Eşrefoğlu Mosque]] in [[Beyşehir]] in Konya province by R.M. Riefstahl in 1925.&lt;ref name="Beyshehir fragments"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Riefstahl|first1=Rudolf Meyer|title=Primitive Rugs of the "Konya" type in the Mosque of Beyshehir|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=December 1931|volume=13|issue=4|pages=177–220}}&lt;/ref&gt; More fragments were found in [[Fustat|Fostat]], today a suburb of the city of Cairo.&lt;ref name="Lamm, 1937"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamm|first1=C.J.|title=Carpet fragments: The Marby rug and some fragments of carpets found in Egypt (Nationalmuseums skriftserie)|date=1985|publisher=Swedish National Museum|isbn=978-9171002914|edition=1937 reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By their original size (Riefstahl reports a carpet up to {{convert|6|m|abbr=off}} long), the Konya carpets must have been produced in town manufactories, as looms of this size cannot be set up in a nomadic or village home. Where exactly these carpets were woven is unknown. The field patterns of the Konya carpets are mostly geometric, and small in relation to the carpet size. Similar patterns are arranged in diagonal rows: Hexagons with plain, or hooked outlines; squares filled with stars, with interposed kufic-like ornaments; hexagons in diamonds composed of rhomboids, rhomboids filed with stylized flowers and leaves. Their main borders often contain kufic ornaments. The corners are not “resolved”, which means that the border design is cut off, and does not continue around the corners. The colours (blue, red, green, to a lesser extent also white, brown, yellow) are subdued, frequently two shades of the same colour are opposed to each other. Nearly all carpet fragments show different patterns and ornaments.

The Beyşehir carpets are closely related to the Konya carpets in design and colour.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Erdmann, Kurt|year=1970|title=Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets|location=Berkeley, California|publisher=University of California Press (translated from the German ''Siebenhundert Jahre Orientteppich'' by May H. Beattie and Hildegard Herzog)|isbn=9780520018167}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the "animal carpets" of the following period, depictings of animals are rarely seen in the Seljuq carpet fragments. Rows of horned quadrupeds placed opposite to each other, or birds beside a tree can be recognized on some fragments. A near-complete carpet of this kind is now at the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha]]. It has survived in a Tibetan monastery and was removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the [[Cultural Revolution|Chinese cultural revolution]].

The style of the Seljuq carpets finds parallels amongst the architectural decoration of contemporaneous mosques such as those at [[Divriği Great Mosque and Hospital|Divriği]], [[Sivas]], and [[Erzurum]], and may be related to Byzantine art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brüggemann|first1=Werner|title=Der Orientteppich = The Oriental Carpet|date=2007|publisher=Dr Ludwig Reichert Verlag|location=Wiesbaden, Germany|isbn=978-3-89500-563-3|pages=87–176|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carpets are today at the [[Mevlana Museum]] in Konya, and at the [[Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum]] in Istanbul.

=== Current understanding of the origin of pile-woven carpets ===
Knotted pile woven carpets were likely produced by people who were already familiar with extra-weft wrapping techniques. The different knot types in carpets from locations as distant from each other like the Pazyryk carpet (symmetric), the East Turkestan and Lop Nur (alternate single-weft knots), the At-Tar (symmetric, asymmetric, asymmetric loop kots), and the Fustat fragments (looped-pile, single, asymmetric knots) suggest that the technique as such may have evolved at different places and times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balpınar|first1=Belkıs|last2=Hirsch|first2=Udo|title=Carpets of the Vakiflar Museum Istanbul = Teppiche des Vakiflar-Museums Istanbul|date=1988|publisher=U. Hülsey|location=Wesel|isbn=3923185049|pages=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also debated whether pile-knotted carpets were initially woven by nomads who tried to imitate animal pelts as tent-floor coverings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Der Orientalische Knüpfteppich. tr. C. G. Ellis as Oriental Carpets: An Essay on Their History, New York, 1960.|date=1965|publisher=Verlag Ernst Wasmuth|location=Tübingen|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; or if they were a product of settled peoples. A number of knives was found in the graves of women of a settled community in southwest [[Turkestan]]. The knives are remarkably similar to those used by Turkmen weavers for trimming the pile of a carpet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chlopin|first1=Igor Nikolaevitch|title=Jungbronzezeitliche Gräberfelder im Sumbar-Tal, Südwest-Turkmenistan = Early Bronze age cemeteries in the Sumbar valley, East Turkestan|date=1986|publisher=Beck|location=München|isbn=978-3406315398|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/29303067?q&amp;versionId=35641318|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khlopin|first1=Igor Nikolaevitch|title=The manufacture of pile carpets in Bronze Age Central Asia.|journal=Hali|date=1982|volume=5|issue=2|pages=116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient motifs on Turkmen carpets closely resemble the ornaments seen on early pottery from the same region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinner|first1=Robert|title=Decorative designs on prehistoric Turkmenian ceramics.|journal=Hali|date=1982|volume=5|issue=2|pages=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings suggest that Turkestan may be among the first places we know of where pile-woven carpets were produced, but this does not mean it was the only place.

In the light of ancient sources and archaeological discoveries, it seems highly likely that the pile-woven carpet developed from one of the extra-weft wrapping weaving techniques, and was first woven by settled people. The technique has probably evolved separately at different places and times. During the migrations of nomadic groups from Central Asia, the technique and designs may have spread throughout the area which was to become the “rug belt” in later times. With the emergence of Islam, the westward migration of nomadic groups began to change Near Eastern history. After this period, knotted-pile carpets became an important form of art under the influence of Islam, and where the nomadic tribes spread, and began to be known as “Oriental” or “Islamic” carpets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balpınar|first1=Belkıs|last2=Hirsch|first2=Udo|title=Carpets of the Vakiflar Museum Istanbul = Teppiche des Vakiflar-Museums Istanbul|date=1988|publisher=U.

An oriental rug is woven by hand on a loom, with warps, wefts, and pile made mainly of natural fibers like wool, cotton, and silk. In representative carpets, metal threads made of gold or silver are woven in. The pile consists of hand-spun or machine-spun strings of yarn, which are knotted into the warp and weft foundation. Usually the pile threads are dyed with various natural or synthetic dyes. Once the weaving has finished, the rug is further processed by fastening its borders, clipping the pile to obtain an even surface, and washing, which may use added chemical solutions to modify the colours.

=== Materials ===

Materials used in carpet weaving and the way they are combined vary in different rug weaving areas. Mainly, animal [[wool]] from sheep and goats is used, occasionally also from camels. Yak and horse hair have been used in Far Eastern, but rarely in Middle Eastern rugs. [[Cotton]] is used for the foundation of the rug, but also in the pile. [[Silk]] from [[Bombyx mori|silk worms]] is used for representational rugs.

==== Wool ====

In most oriental rugs, the pile is of [[Sheep|sheep's]] wool. Its characteristics and quality vary from each area to the next, depending on the breed of sheep, climatic conditions, pasturage, and the particular customs relating to when and how the wool is shorn and processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|page=32|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle East, rug wools come mainly from the [[Fat-tailed sheep|fat-tailed]] and fat-rumped sheep races, which are distinguished, as their names suggest, by the accumulation of fat in the respective parts of their bodies. Different areas of a sheep's fleece yield different qualities of wool, depending on the ratio between the thicker and stiffer sheep hair and the finer fibers of the wool. Usually, sheep are [[Sheep shearing|shorn]] in spring and fall. The spring shear produces wool of finer quality. The lowest grade of wool used in carpet weaving is “skin” wool, which is removed chemically from dead animal skin.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; Fibers from [[camel]]s and [[goat]]s are also used. Goat hair is mainly used for fastening the borders, or selvages, of [[Baluch rug|Baluchi]] and [[Turkmen rug]]s, since it is more resistant to abrasion. Camel wool is occasionally used in Middle Eastern rugs. It is often dyed in black, or used in its natural colour. More often, wool said to be camel's wool turns out to be dyed sheep wool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth % Co., Ltd|location=London|page=25|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cotton ====

[[Cotton]] forms the foundation of warps and wefts of the majority of modern rugs. Nomads who cannot afford to buy cotton on the market use wool for warps and wefts, which are also traditionally made of wool in areas where cotton was not a local product. Cotton can be spun more tightly than wool, and tolerates more tension, which makes cotton a superior material for the foundation of a rug. Especially larger carpets are more likely to lie flat on the floor, whereas wool tends to shrink unevenly, and carpets with a woolen foundation may buckle when wet.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; Chemically treated ([[Mercerised cotton|mercerised]]) cotton has been used in rugs as a silk substitute since the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

==== Silk ====

[[Silk]] is an expensive material, and has been used for representative carpets of the Mamluk, Ottoman, and Safavid courts. Its tensile strength has been used in silk warps, but silk also appears in the carpet pile. Silk pile can be used to highlight special elements of the design in [[Turkmen rug]]s, but more expensive carpets from Kashan, Qum, Nain, and Isfahan in Persia, and Istanbul and Hereke in Turkey, have all-silk piles. Silk pile carpets are often exceptionally fine, with a short pile and an elaborate design. Silk pile is less resistant to mechanical stress, thus, all-silk piles are often used as wall hangings, or pillow tapestry. Silk is more often used in rugs of Eastern Turkestan and Northwestern China, but these rugs tend to be more coarsely woven.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

=== Spinning ===
{{see also|Hand spinning|Spinning (textiles)}}

[[File:Yarn twist S-Left Z-Right.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.5|S-twist and Z-twist yarns]]

The fibers of wool, cotton, and silk are spun either by hand or mechanically by using [[spinning wheel]]s or industrial [[Spinning frame|spinning machines]] to produce the yarn. The direction in which the yarn is spun is called ''twist''. Yarns are characterized as S-twist or Z-twist according to the direction of spinning (see diagram).&lt;ref&gt;Kadolph, Sara J., ed.: ''Textiles'', 10th edition, Pearson/Prentice-Hall, 2007, {{ISBN|0-13-118769-4}}, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Two or more spun yarns may be twisted together or ''[[plying|plied]]'' to form a thicker yarn. Generally, handspun single plies are spun with a Z-twist, and plying is done with an S-twist. With the exception of Mamluk carpets, nearly all the rugs produced in the countries of the rug belt use "Z" (anti-clockwise) spun and "S" (clockwise)-plied wool.
{{clear}}

=== Dyeing ===

[[File:Carpet factory.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5 |Naturally dyed wool in a Turkish carpet manufacture]]

The dyeing process involves the preparation of the yarn in order to make it susceptible for the proper dyes by immersion in a [[mordant]]. Dyestuffs are then added to the yarn which remains in the dyeing solution for a defined time. The dyed yarn is then left to dry, exposed to air and sunlight. Some colours, especially dark brown, require iron mordants, which can damage or fade the fabric. This often results in faster pile wear in areas dyed in dark brown colours, and may create a relief effect in antique oriental carpets.

==== Vegetal dyes ====

[[Natural dye|Traditional dyes]] used for oriental rugs are obtained from plants and insects. In 1856, the English chemist [[William Henry Perkin]] invented the first [[aniline]] dye, [[mauveine]]. A variety of other synthetic [[dyes]] were invented thereafter. Cheap, readily prepared and easy to use as they were compared to natural dyes, their use is documented in oriental rugs since the mid 1860s. The tradition of natural dyeing was revived in Turkey in the early 1980s, and later on, in Iran.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Vegetal Dyes: Iran restores an ancient tradition.|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1992|volume=III|issue=10|pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical analyses led to the identification of natural dyes from antique wool samples, and dyeing recipes and processes were experimentally re-created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boehmer|first1=Harald|title=The Revival of Natural Dyeing in Two Traditional Weaving Areas of Anatolia|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1983|volume=III|issue=9|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atlihan|first1=Serife|title=Traditional Weaving in One Village of Settled Nomads in Northwest Anatolia|journal=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies|date=1993|volume=IV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to these analyzes, natural dyes used in Turkish carpets include:
* ''Red'' from [[Rubia tinctorum|Madder (Rubia tinctorum)]] roots,
* ''Yellow'' from plants, including [[Onion|onion (Allium cepa)]], several chamomile species ([[Anthemis]], [[Matricaria chamomilla]]), and [[Euphorbia]],
* ''Black'': [[Oak apple]]s, [[Oak|Oak acorns]], [[Rhus coriaria|Tanner's sumach]],
* ''Green'' by double dyeing with [[Indigo]] and yellow dye,
* ''Orange'' by double dyeing with madder red and yellow dye,
* ''Blue'': [[Indigo]] gained from [[Indigofera tinctoria]].
Some of the dyestuffs like indigo or madder were goods of trade, and thus commonly available. Yellow or brown dyestuffs more substantially vary from region to region. In some instances, the analysis of the dye has provided information about the provenience of a rug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Enez|first1=N.|editor1-last=Eiland jr.|editor1-first=M.L.|title=Dye research on the prayer rugs of the Topkapi Collection|journal=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies|date=1993|volume=IV|pages=191–204|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many plants provide yellow dyes, like Vine weld, or Dyer's weed ''([[Reseda luteola]])'', Yellow larkspur (perhaps identical with the ''isparek'' plant), or Dyer's sumach [[Cotinus coggygria]]. Grape leaves and pomegranate rinds, as well as other plants, provide different shades of yellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|page=54|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Insect reds ====

[[Carmine]] dyes are obtained from resinous secretions of scale insects such as the [[Cochineal]] scale [[Coccus cacti]], and certain Porphyrophora species ([[Armenian cochineal|Armenian]] and [[Polish cochineal]]). Cochineal dye, the so-called "laq" was formerly exported from India, and later on from Mexico and the Canary Islands. Insect dyes were more frequently used in areas where [[Rubia tinctorum|Madder (Rubia tinctorum)]] was not grown, like west and north-west Persia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth % Co., Ltd|location=London|pages=33–34|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Synthetic dyes ====

With modern synthetic [[dyes]], nearly every colour and shade can be obtained so that it is nearly impossible to identify, in a finished carpet, whether natural or artificial dyes were used. Modern carpets can be woven with carefully selected synthetic colours, and provide artistic and utilitarian value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Emmett|title=Oriental Rugs Today|date=2003|publisher=Berkeley Hills Books, Albany, CA|isbn=1-893163-46-6|pages=50–59|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Abrash ====

The appearance of slight deviations within the same colour is called abrash (from Turkish ''abraş'', literally, “speckled, piebald”). Abrash is seen in traditionally dyed oriental rugs. Its occurrence suggests that a single weaver has likely woven the carpet, who did not have enough time or resources to prepare a sufficient quantity of dyed yarn to complete the rug. Only small batches of wool were dyed from time to time. When one string of wool was used up, the weaver continued with the newly dyed batch. Because the exact hue of colour is rarely met again when a new batch is dyed, the colour of the pile changes when a new row of knots is woven in. As such, the colour variation suggests a village or tribal woven rug, and is appreciated as a sign of quality and authenticity. Abrash can also be introduced on purpose into a pre-planned carpet design.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Bannon|first1=George|title=Oriental rugs : the collector's guide to selecting, identifying, and enjoying new and vintage oriental rugs|date=1995|publisher=Courage Press|location=Pennsylvania, Pa.|isbn=9781561385287|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tools ===
{{see also|Weaving}}
A variety of tools are needed for the construction of a handmade rug. A [[loom]], a horizontal or upright framework, is needed to mount the vertical [[Warp (weaving)|warps]] into which the pile nodes are knotted. One or more shoots of horizontal [[Warp and woof|wefts]] are woven (“shot”) in after each row of knots in order to further stabilize the fabric.

==== Horizontal looms ====

Nomads usually use a horizontal loom. In its simplest form, two loom beams are fastened, and kept apart by stakes which are driven into the ground. The tension of the warps is maintained by driving wedges between the loom beams and the stakes. If the nomad journey goes on, the stakes are pulled out, and the unfinished rug is rolled up on the beams. The size of the loom beams is limited by the need to be easily transportable, thus, genuine nomad rugs are often small in size. In Persia, loom beams were mostly made of poplar, because poplar is the only tree which is easily available and straight.&lt;ref name="The Persian Carpet"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co., Ltd|location=London|pages=22–28|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closer the warps are spanned, the more dense the rug can be woven. The width of a rug is always determined by the length of the loom beams. Weaving starts at the lower end of the loom, and proceeds towards the upper end.

Traditionally, horizontal looms were used by the
* [[Kurds]], [[Afshar people|Afshari]], [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]], [[Lurs]], [[Beluch]], [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] and [[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiari]] in Persia,
* [[Beluch]] and [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] in Afghanistan and Turkmenistan
* Kurds and nomads ([[Yörük]]) in Anatolia.

==== Vertical looms ====

The technically more advanced, stationary vertical looms are used in villages and town manufactures. The more advanced types of vertical looms are more comfortable, as they allow for the weavers to retain their position throughout the entire weaving process. In essence, the width of the carpet is limited by the length of the loom beams. While the dimensions of a horizontal loom define the maximum size of the rug which can be woven on it, on a vertical loom longer carpets can be woven, as the completed sections of the rugs can be moved to the back of the loom, or rolled up on a beam, as the weaving proceeds.&lt;ref name="The Persian Carpet"/&gt;

There are three general types of vertical looms, all of which can be modified in a number of ways: the fixed village loom, the [[Tabriz]] or Bunyan loom, and the roller beam loom.

# The fixed village loom is used mainly in [[Iran]] and consists of a fixed upper beam and a moveable lower or cloth beam which slots into two sidepieces. The correct tension of the warps is obtained by driving wedges into the slots. The weavers work on an adjustable plank which is raised as the work progresses.
# The Tabriz loom, named after the city of [[Tabriz]], is used in Northwestern Iran. The warps are continuous and pass around behind the loom. Warp tension is obtained with wedges. The weavers sit on a fixed seat and when a portion of the carpet has been completed, the tension is released, the finished section of the carpet is pulled around the lower beam and upwards on the back of the loom. The Tabriz type of vertical loom allows for weaving of carpets up to double the length of the loom.
# The roller beam loom is used in larger Turkish manufactures, but is also found in Persia and India. It consists of two movable beams to which the warps are attached. Both beams are fitted with ratchets or similar locking devices. Once a section of the carpet is completed, it is wound up on the lower beam. On a roller beam loom, any length of carpet can be produced. In some areas of Turkey several rugs are woven in series on the same warps, and separated from each other by cutting the warps after the weaving is finished.
The vertical loom enables weaving of larger rug formats. The most simple vertical loom, usually used in villages, has fixed beams. The length of the loom determines the length of the rug. As the weaving proceeds, the weavers' benches must be moved upwards, and fixed again at the new working height. Another type of loom is used in manufactures. The wefts are fixed and spanned on the beams, or, in more advanced types of looms, the wefts are spanned on a roller beam, which allows for any length of carpet to be woven, as the finished part of the carpet is rolled up on the roller beam. Thus, the weavers' benches always remain at the same height.

==== Other tools ====

Few essential tools are needed in carpet weaving: Knives are used to cut the yarn after the knot is made, a heavy instrument like a comb for beating in the wefts, and a pair of scissors for trimming off the ends of the yarn after each row of knots is finished. From region to region, they vary in size and design, and in some areas are supplemented by other tools. The weavers of Tabriz used a combined blade and hook. The hook projects from the end of the blade, and is used for knotting, instead of knotting with the fingers. Comb-beaters are passed through the warp strings to beat in the wefts. When the rug is completed, the pile is often shorn with special knives to obtain an even surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth % Co., Ltd|location=London|pages=24–25|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Warp, weft, pile ===

[[Warp (weaving)|Warps]] and [[Warp and woof|wefts]] form the foundation of the carpet, the pile accounts for the design. Warps, wefts and pile may consist of any of these materials:

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! warp

|wool ||wool ||wool ||nomad and village rugs
|-

|}

Rugs can be woven with their warp strings held back on different levels, termed sheds. This is done by pulling the wefts of one shed tight, separating the warps on two different levels, which leaves one warp on a lower level. The technical term is “one warp is depressed”. Warps can be depressed slightly, ore more tightly, which will cause a more or less pronounced rippling or “ridging” on the back of the rug. A rug woven with depressed warps is described as “double warped”. Central Iranian city rugs such as Kashan, Isfahan, Qom, and Nain have deeply depressed warps, which make the pile more dense, the rug is heavier than a more loosely woven specimen, and the rug lies more firmly on the floor. Kurdish [[Bidjar rug|Bidjar carpets]] make most pronounced use of warp depression. Often their pile is further compacted by the use of a metal rod which is driven between the warps and hammered down on, which produces a dense and rigid fabric.&lt;ref name="Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|isbn=978-0821225486|pages=35–38|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Knots ===

}}

The pile knots are usually knotted by hand. Most rugs from Anatolia utilize the symmetrical [[Ghiordes knot|Turkish double knot]]. With this form of knotting, each end of the pile thread is twisted around two warp threads at regular intervals, so that both ends of the knot come up between two warp strings on one side of the carpet, opposite to the knot. The thread is then pulled downwards and cut with a knife.

Most rugs from other provenances use the asymmetric, or [[Persian knot]]. This knot is tied by winding a piece of thread around one warp, and halfway around the next warp, so that both ends of the thread come up at the same side of two adjacent strings of warp on one side of the carpet, opposite to the knot. The pile, i.e., the loose end of the thread, can appear on the left or right side of the warps, thus defining the terms “open to the left” or “open to the right”. Variances in the type of knots are significant, as the type of knot used in a carpet may vary on a regional, or tribal, basis. Whether the knots are open to the left or to the right can be determined by passing one's hands over the pile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|isbn=1-85669-132-2|pages=35–38|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant knot is the so-called jufti knot, which is woven around four strings of warp, with each loop of one single knot tied around two warps. Jufti can be knotted symmetrically or asymmetrically, open to the left or right.&lt;ref name="Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide"/&gt;  A serviceable carpet can be made with jufti knots, and jufti knots are sometimes used in large single-colour areas of a rug, for example in the field. However, as carpets woven wholly or partly with the jufti knot need only half the amount of pile yarn than traditionally woven carpets, their pile is less resistant to wear, and these rugs do not last long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth % Co., Ltd|location=London|pages=366–7|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variant of knot is known from early Spanish rugs. The Spanish knot or single-warp knot, is tied around one single warp. Some of the rug fragments excavated by A. Stein in Turfan seem to be woven with a single knot. Single knot weavings are also known from [[Egypt]]ian [[Copts|Coptic]] pile rugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|isbn=978-0821225486|pages=37–38|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irregular knots sometimes occur, and include missed warps, knots over three or four warps, single warp knots, or knots sharing one warp, both symmetric and asymmetric. They are frequently found in Turkmen rugs, and contribute to the dense and regular structure of these rugs.

Diagonal, or offset knotting has knots in successive rows occupy alternate pairs of warps. This feature allows for changes from one half knot to the next, and creates diagonal pattern lines at different angles. It is sometimes found in Kurdish or Turkmen rugs, particularly in Yomuds. It is mostly tied symmetrically.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

The upright pile of oriental rugs usually inclines in one direction, as knots are always pulled downwards before the string of pile yarn is cut off and work resumes on the next knot, piling row after row of knots on top of each other. When passing one's hand over a carpet, this creates a feeling similar to stroking an animal's fur. This can be used to determine where the weaver has started knotting the pile. [[Prayer rug]]s are often woven “upside down”, as becomes apparent when the direction of the pile is assessed. This has both technical reasons (the weaver can focus on the more complicated niche design first), and practical consequences (the pile bends in the direction of the worshipper's prostration).

==== Knot count ====
{{Main|Knot count}}
[[File:Knoopdichtheid ghom.jpg|thumb|Back side of a [[Qom rug]] with very high knot density]]
The knot count is expressed in knots per square inch (''kpsi'') or per square decimeter. Knot count per square decimeter can be converted to square inch by division by 15.5. Knot counts are best performed on the back of the rug. If the warps are not too deeply depressed, the two loops of one knot will remain visible, and will have to be counted as one knot. If one warp is deeply depressed, only one loop of the knot may be visible, which has to be considered when the knots are counted.

Compared to the kpsi counts, additional structural information is obtained when the horizontal and vertical knots are counted separately. In Turkmen carpets, the ratio between horizontal and vertical knots is frequently close to 1:1. Considerable technical skill is required to achieve this knot ratio. Rugs which are woven in this manner are very dense and durable.&lt;ref name="Tsareva, 2011"/&gt;

Knot counts bear evidence of the fineness of the weaving, and of the amount of labour needed to complete the rug. However, the artistic and utilitarian value of a rug hardly depends on knot counts, but rather on the execution of the design and the colours. For example, Persian Heriz or some Anatolian carpets may have low knot counts as compared to the extremely fine-woven Qom or Nain rugs, but provide artistic designs, and are resistant to wear.

=== Finishing ===
Once the weaving is finished, the rug is cut from the loom. Additional work has to be done before the rug is ready for use.

==== Edges and ends ====

The edges of a rug need additional protection, as they are exposed to particular mechanical stress. The last warps on each side of the rug are often thicker than the inner warps, or doubled. The edge may consist of only one warp, or of a bundle of warps, and is attached to the rugs by weft shoots looping over it, which is termed an “overcast”. The edges are often further reinforced by encircling it in wool, goat's hair, cotton, or silk in various colours and designs. Edges thus reinforced are called selvedges, or ''shirazeh'' from the Persian word.

The remaining ends of the warp threads form the fringes that may be weft-faced, braided, tasseled, or secured in some other manner.  Especially Anatolian village and nomadic rugs have flat-woven [[kilim]] ends, made by shooting in wefts without pile at the beginning and end of the weaving process. They provide further protection against wear, and sometimes include pile-woven tribal signs or village crests.

==== Pile ====

The pile of the carpet is shorn with special knives (or carefully burned down) in order to remove excess pile and obtain an equal surface. In parts of Central Asia, a small sickle-shaped knife with the outside edge sharpened is used for pile shearing. Knives of this shape have been excavated from [[Bronze Age]] sites in Turkmenistan (cited in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|page=31|isbn=978-0821225486|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In some carpets, a relief effect is obtained by clipping the pile unevenly following the contours of the design. This feature is often seen in [[Chinese rug|Chinese]] and [[Tibetan rug|Tibetan]] rugs.

==== Washing ====

Most carpets are washed before they are used or go to the market. The washing may be done with water and soap only, but more often chemicals are added to modify the colours. Various chemical washings were invented in New York, London, and other European centers. The washing often included chlorine bleach or sodium hydrosulfite. Chemical washings not only damage the wool fibers, but change the colours to an extent that some rugs had to be re-painted with different colours after the washing, as is exemplified by the so-called "American Sarouk" carpet.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

== Design ==

Oriental rugs are known for their richly varied designs, but common traditional characteristics identify the design of a carpet as “oriental”.  With the exception of pile relief obtained by clipping the pile unevenly, rug design originates from a two-dimensional arrangement of knots in various colours. Each knot tied into a rug can be regarded as one "[[pixel]]" of a picture, which is composed by the arrangement of knot after knot. The more skilled the weaver or, as in manufactured rugs, the designer, the more elaborate the design.

=== Rectilinear and curvilinear design ===

{{multiple image| align = right | direction = horizontal | header = | header_align = left/right/center | footer = ''Left image'': Silk Tabriz Persian rug with a predominantly curvilinear design&lt;br&gt; ''Right image'': Serapi carpet, Heriz region, Northwest Persia, circa 1875, with a predominantly rectilinear design| footer_align = left | image1 =|Silk Tabriz Persian Rug 7991 with a predominantly curvilinear design| width1 = 185 | caption1  = | image2 =Antique Serapi carpet, Heriz region, Northwest Persia, 9ft 11in x 12ft 10in, circa 1875,.jpg|Serapi carpet, Heriz region, Northwest Persia, circa 1875, with a predominantly rectilinear design| width2 = 200 | caption2 = }}

A rug design is described either as '''rectilinear''' (or “geometric”), or '''curvilinear''' (or “floral”). Curvilinear rugs show floral figures in a realistic manner. The drawing is more fluid, and the weaving is often more complicated. Rectilinear patterns tend to be bolder and more angular. Floral patterns can be woven in rectilinear design, but they tend to be more abstract, or more highly stylized. Rectilinear design is associated with nomadic or village weaving, whereas the intricate curvilinear designs require pre-planning, as is done in factories. Workshop rugs are usually woven according to a plan designed by an artist and handed over to the weaver to execute it on the loom.&lt;ref name="Ford, Oriental Carpet Design"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=P.R.J.|title=Oriental Carpet Design|date=1981|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9780500276648|page=170|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Field design, medallions and borders ===

This feature is typical for [[Turkish carpet|rugs made in Anatolia]].]]

Rug design can also be described by how the surface of the rug is arranged and organized. One single, basic design may cover the entire field (“all-over design”). When the end of the field is reached, patterns may be cut off intentionally, thus creating the impression that they continue beyond the borders of the rug. This feature is characteristic for Islamic design: In the Islamic tradition, depicting animals or humans is [[Aniconism in Islam|prohibited]] even in a profane context, as Islam does not distinguish between religious and profane life. Since the codification of the [[Quran]] by [[Uthman|Uthman Ibn Affan]] in 651 AD/19 AH and the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] reforms, [[Islamic art]] has focused on writing and ornament. The main fields of Islamic rugs are frequently filled with redundant, interwoven ornaments in a manner called "infinite repeat".&lt;ref name="Erdmann, 1943"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Zum Orientteppich|journal=Asienberichte|date=1943|volume=5|issue=19|page=20|location=Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design elements may also be arranged more elaborately. One typical oriental rug design uses a '''medallion''', a symmetrical pattern occupying the center of the field. Parts of the medallion, or similar, corresponding designs, are repeated at the four corners of the field. The common “Lechek Torūnj” (medallion and corner) design was developed in Persia for book covers and ornamental [[Persian miniature|book illuminations]] in the fifteenth century. In the sixteenth century, it was integrated into carpet designs. More than one medallion may be used, and these may be arranged at intervals over the field in different sizes and shapes. The field of a rug may also be broken up into different rectangular, square, diamond or lozenge shaped compartments, which in turn can be arranged in rows, or diagonally.&lt;ref name="Ford, Oriental Carpet Design"/&gt;

In Persian rugs, the medallion represents the primary pattern, and the infinite repeat of the field appears subordinated, creating an impression of the medallion “floating” on the field. Anatolian rugs often use the infinite repeat as the primary pattern, and integrate the medallion as secondary. Its size is often adapted to fit into the infinite repeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Der Orientalische Knüpfteppich. tr. C. G. Ellis as Oriental Carpets: An Essay on Their History, New York, 1960.|date=1965|publisher=Verlag Ernst Wasmuth|location=Tübingen|pages=47–51|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most Oriental rugs, the field of the rug is surrounded by stripes, or borders. These may number from one up to over ten, but usually there is one wider main border surrounded by minor, or guardian borders. The main border is often filled with complex and elaborate rectilinear or curvilinear designs. The minor border stripes show simpler designs like meandering vines or reciprocal trefoils. The latter are frequently found in Caucasian and some Turkish rugs, and are related to the Chinese “cloud collar” (yun chien) motif.&lt;ref name="Eberhart Herrmann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herrmann|first1=Eberhart|title=From Konya to Kokand - Rare Oriental Carpets III|date=1982|publisher=Eberhart Herrmann|location=Munich}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional border arrangement was highly conserved through time, but can also be modified to the effect that the field encroaches on the main border. Seen in Kerman rugs and Turkish rugs from the late eighteenth century "mecidi" period, this feature was likely taken over from French [[Aubusson tapestry|Aubusson]] or [[Savonnerie]] weaving designs. Additional end borders called ''elem'', or skirts, are seen in Turkmen and some Turkish rugs. Their design often differs from the rest of the borders. Elem are used to protect the lower borders of tent door rugs ("ensi"). [[Chinese rug|Chinese]] and [[Tibetan rug|Tibetan]] rugs sometimes do not have any borders.

Designing the carpet borders becomes particularly challenging when it comes to the corner articulations. The ornaments have to be woven in a way that the pattern continues without interruption around the corners between horizontal and vertical borders. This requires advance planning either by a skilled weaver who is able to plan the design from start, or by a designer who composes a cartoon before the weaving begins. If the ornaments articulate correctly around the corners, the corners are termed to be “resolved”. In village or nomadic rugs, which are usually woven without a detailed advance plan, the corners of the borders are often not resolved. The weaver has discontinued the pattern at a certain stage, e.g., when the lower horizontal border is finished, and starts anew with the vertical borders. The analysis of the corner resolutions helps distinguishing rural village, or nomadic, from workshop rugs.

=== Smaller and composite design elements ===

The field, or sections of it, can also be covered with smaller design elements. The overall impression may be homogeneous, although the design of the elements themselves can be highly complicated. Amongst the repeating figures, the ''[[Paisley (design)|boteh]]'' is used throughout the “carpet belt”. Boteh can be depicted in curvilinear or rectilinear style. The most elaborate boteh are found in rugs woven around [[Kerman carpet|Kerman]]. Rugs from [[Seraband rug|Seraband]], Hamadan, and Fars sometimes show the boteh in an all-over pattern. Other design elements include ancient motifs like the [[Tree of life]], or floral and geometric elements like, e.g., stars or palmettes.

Single design elements can also be arranged in groups, forming a more complex pattern:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth % Co., Ltd|location=London|pages=36–51|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=P.R.J.|title=Oriental Carpet Design|date=1981|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9780500276648|pages=51–168|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Herati''' pattern consists of a lozenge with floral figure at the corners surrounded by lancet-shaped leaves sometimes called “fish”.  Herati patterns are used throughout the “carpet belt”; typically, they are found in the fields of [[Bidjar rug]]s. 
* The '''Mina Khani''' pattern is made up of flowers arranged in a rows, interlinked by diamond (often curved) or circular lines. frequently all over the field. The Mina Khani design is often seen on [[Varamin Carpet|Varamin rugs]].
* The '''Shah Abbasi''' design is composed of a group of palmettes. Shah Abbasi motifs are frequently seen in [[Kashan rug|Kashan]], [[Isfahan rug|Isfahan]], [[Mashhad rug|Mashhad]] and [[Nain rug|Nain]] rugs.
* The '''Bid Majnūn''', or Weeping Willow design is in fact a combination of weeping willow, cypress, poplar and fruit trees in rectilinear form. Its origin was attributed to Kurdish tribes, as the earliest known examples are from the Bidjar area.
* The '''Harshang''' or Crab design takes its name from its principal motive, which is a large oval motive suggesting a crab. The pattern is found all over the rug belt, but bear some resemblance to palmettes from the Sefavi period, and the “claws” of the crab may be conventionalized arabesques in rectilinear style.
* The '''Gol Henai''' small repeating pattern is named after the Henna plant, which it does not much resemble. The plant looks more like the Garden balsam, and in the Western literature is sometimes compared to the blossom of the Horse chestnut.
* The '''[[Gül|Gul]]''' design is frequently found in [[Turkmen rug]]s. Small round or octagonal medallions are repeated in rows all over the field. Although the Gül medallion itself can be very elaborate and colourful, their arrangement within the monochrome field often generates a stern and somber impression. Güls are often ascribed a heraldic function, as it is possible to identify the tribal provenience of a Turkmen rug by its güls.&lt;ref name="Thompson, Turkmen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Ian|title=Turkmen.

=== Special designs ===
A different type of field design in a specific Islamic design tradition is used in [[prayer rug]]s. A prayer rug is characterized by a niche at one end, representing the [[mihrab]], an architectural element in [[mosque]]s intended to direct the worshippers towards the [[Qibla]].  Prayer rugs also show highly symbolic smaller design elements like one or more [[mosque lamp]]s, a reference to the [[Verse of Light]] in the [[Qur'an]], or water jugs, potentially as a reminder towards ritual cleanliness. Sometimes stylized hands or feet appear in the field to indicate where the worshipper should stand, or to represent the praying person's prostration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=P.R.J.|title=Oriental Carpet Design|date=1981|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9780500276648|pages=127–143|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other special types include garden, compartment, vase, animal, or pictorial designs

=== The 15th century "design revolution" ===

During the 15th century, a fundamental change appeared in carpet design. Because no carpets survived from this period, research has focused on [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]] period book illuminations and [[Persian miniature|miniature]] paintings. Earlier Timurid paintings depict colourful carpets with repeating designs of equal-scale geometric patterns, arranged in checkerboard-like designs, with “kufic” border ornaments derived from [[Islamic calligraphy]]. The designs are so similar to period Anatolian carpets, especially the “[[Holbein carpet]]s” that a common source of the design cannot be excluded: Timurid designs may have survived in both the Persian and Anatolian carpets from the early Safavid, and Ottoman period.&lt;ref name="Briggs, Timurid carpets"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briggs|first1=Amy|title=Timurid Carpets; I. Geometric carpets|journal=Ars Islamica|date=1940|volume=7|pages=20–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late fifteenth century, the design of the carpets depicted in miniatures changed considerably. Large-format medaillons appeared, ornaments began to show elaborate curvilinear designs. Large spirals and tendrils, floral ornaments, depictions of flowers and animals, were often mirrored along the long or short axis of the carpet to obtain harmony and rhythm. The earlier “kufic” border design was replaced by tendrils and [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesques]]. The resulting change in carpet design was what [[Kurt Erdmann]] termed the '''“carpet design revolution”'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Der Orientalische Knüpfteppich. tr.

== Intra- and intercultural contexts ==
[[File:TownVillageNomads.jpg|thumb|Cultural interactions in traditional carpet production]]

Four "social layers" of carpet production can be distinguished: Rugs were woven simultaneously by and for nomads, rural villages, towns, and the royal court. Rural village, and nomad carpet designs represent independent artistic traditions.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Early Turkish Carpet"/&gt; Elaborate rug designs from court and town were integrated into village and nomadic design traditions by means of a process termed stylization.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt; When rugs are woven for the market, the weavers adapt their production in order to meet the customers' demands, and to maximize their profit. As is the case with Oriental rugs, adaptation to the export market has brought forth both devastating effects on the culture of rug weaving, but has also led to a revival of old traditions in more recent years.

=== Representative ("court") carpets ===
[[File:Mir Sayyid Ali 2.jpg|thumb|Persian miniature by Mir Sayyid Ali, circa 1540. [[British Museum]], London]]

Representative "court" rugs were woven by special workshops, often founded and supervised by the sovereign, with the intention to represent power and status:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=P.R.J.|title=Oriental Carpet Design|date=1981|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9780500276648|pages=273–275|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Byzantine Empire|East Roman (Byzantine)]] and the Persian [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] Empires have coexisted for more than 400 years. Artistically, both empires have developed similar styles and decorative vocabularies, as exemplified by mosaics and architecture of Roman [[Antioch]].&lt;ref name="Masterpieces Islamic Art, 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ekthiar|first1=MD|last2=Soucek|first2=PP|last3=Canby|first3=SR|last4=Haidar|first4=NN|title=Masterpieces from the Department of Islamic Art in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|date=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58839-434-7|pages=20–24|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Anatolian carpet pattern depicted on [[Jan van Eyck]]'s [[Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele|“Paele Madonna”]] painting was traced back to late Roman origins and related to early Islamic floor mosaics found in the Umayyad palace of [[Hisham's Palace|Khirbat al-Mafjar]].&lt;ref name="Brüggemann, Orientteppich 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brüggemann|first1=Werner|title=Der Orientteppich/The Oriental Carpet|date=2007|publisher=Dr Ludwig Reichert Verlag|location=Wiesbaden, Germany|isbn=978-3-89500-563-3|pages=87–176|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rugs were produced in the court manufactures as special commissions or gifts (some carpets included inwoven European coats of arms). Their elaborate design required a division of work between an artist who created a design plan (termed “cartoon”) on paper, and a weaver who was given the plan for execution on the loom. Thus, artist and weaver were separated.&lt;ref name="Carpets from Islamic Lands"/&gt; Their appearance in Persian book illuminations and [[Persian miniature|miniatures]] as well as in European paintings provides material for their dating by using the [[Terminus post quem|''“terminus ante quem”'']] approach.

=== Town, village, nomadic rugs ===

High-status examples like Safavid or Ottoman court carpets are not the only foundation of the historical and social framework. The reality of carpet production does not reflect this selection: Carpets were simultaneously produced by and for the three different social levels. Patterns and ornaments from court manufactory rugs have been reproduced by smaller (town or village) workshops. This process is well documented for Ottoman prayer rugs.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt; As prototypical court designs were passed on to smaller workshops, and from one generation to the next, the design underwent a process termed stylization, comprising series of small, incremental changes either in the overall design, or in details of smaller patterns and ornaments, over time. As a result, the prototype may be modified to an extent as to barely being recognizable. A mihrab column may change into a detached row of ornaments, a Chinese dragon may undergo stylization until it becomes unrecognizable in a Caucasian dragon carpet.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt;

==== Stylization in Turkish prayer rug design ====

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Pile rugs and flat weaves were essential items in all rural households and nomadic tents. They were part of a tradition that was at times influenced, but essentially distinct from the invented designs of the workshop production. Frequently, mosques had acquired rural carpets as [[Waqf|charitable gifts]], which provided material for studies.&lt;ref name="Balpinar, Vakiflar Museum"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balpinar|first1=Belkis|last2=Hirsch|first2=Udo|title=Carpets of the Vakiflar Museum Istanbul|date=1988|publisher=U. Hülsey|location=Wesel, Germany|isbn=9783923185047|edition=German/English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rural carpets rarely include cotton for warps and wefts, and almost never silk, as these materials had to be purchased on the market.

With the end of the traditional [[Transhumance|nomadic lifestyle]] in large parts of the rug belt area, and the consequent loss of specific traditions, it has become difficult to identify a genuine “nomadic rug”. Tribes known for their nomadic lifestyle like the [[Yürük]] in Anatolia, or the [[Kurds]] and [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]] in contemporary Turkey and Southwestern Iran have voluntarily or by force acquired sedentary lifestyles. Migration of peoples and tribes, in peace or warfare, has frequently happened throughout the history of [[Turkic peoples]], as well as Persian and Caucasian tribes. Some designs may have been preserved, which can be identified as specifically nomadic or tribal.&lt;ref name="Tribal Rugs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Housego|first1=Jenny|title=Tribal Rugs|date=1998|publisher=Olive Branch Press|location=London|isbn=9781566562188|edition=1998 reissue}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="David Black Oriental Carpets"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=David|last2=Loveless|first2=Clive|title=Woven Gardens: Nomad and Village Rugs of the Fars Province of Southern Persia|date=1979|publisher=David Black Oriental Carpets|location=London|isbn=9780950501833|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackie &amp; Thompson, Tribal carpets"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Mackie|editor1-first=Louise|editor2-last=Thompson|editor2-first=Jon|title=Turkmen: Tribal Carpets and Traditions|date=1980|publisher=The Textile Museum|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=9780295965956|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia|date=1981|publisher=James Opie Oriental Rugs Inc.|location=Portland, Oregon|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Tribal rugs - Nomadic and Village Weavings from the Near East and Central Asia|date=1992|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|isbn=1-85669-025-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Nomadic” rugs can be identified by their material, construction, and colours.

Criteria for nomadic production include:&lt;ref name="Brueggemann/Boehmer, 1982"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brüggemann, W., and Boehmer, H.|title=Teppiche der Bauern und Nomaden in Anatolien|date=1982|publisher=Verlag Kunst und Antiquitäten|location=Munich|isbn=3-921811-20-1|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unusual materials like warps made of goat's hair, or camel wool in the pile;
* high quality wool with long pile (Anatolian and Turkmen nomads);
* small format fitting for a horizontal loom;
* irregular format due to frequent re-assembly of the loom, resulting in irregular tension of the warps;
* pronounced abrash (irregularities within the same colour due to dyeing of yarn in small batches);
* inclusion of flat weaves at the ends.

Within the genre of carpet weaving, the most authentic village and nomadic products were those woven to serve the needs of the community, which were not intended for export or trade other than local. This includes specialized bags and bolster covers (''yastik'') in Anatolia, which show designs adapted from the earliest weaving traditions.&lt;ref name="Steiner, Heybe ve Torba"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steiner|first1=Elisabeth|last2=Pinkwart|first2=Doris|last3=Ammermann|first3=Eberhart|title=Bergama Heybe ve Torba: Traditional bags of the Yürüks in Northwest Anatolia, Observations from 1970 to 2007 / Traditionelle Taschen der Yürüken Nordwest-Anatoliens.

Smaller (''torba'') and midsize (''mafrash'') and a variety of special bags to keep bread or salt were woven. They are usually made of two sides, one or both of them pile or flat-woven, and then sewn together. Long tent bands woven in mixed pile and flat weave adorned the tents, and carpets known as ''ensi'' covered the entrance of the tent, while the door was decorated with a pile-woven door surround. Turkmen, and also tribes like the [[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiari]] nomads of western Iran, or the [[Qashqai people]] wove animal trappings like saddle covers, or special decorations for weddings like ''asmalyk'', pentagonally shaped camel coverings used for wedding decorations. Tribal signs like the Turkmen [[Gül]] can support the assessment of provenience.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt;

=== Symbolism and the origin of patterns ===

{{Quotation|The symbolism of Oriental rug designs has recently been made the subject of a number of articles. Many of the ideas put forward are of great interest, but to attempt to discuss such a subject without a profound knowledge of the philosophies of the East would be unwise, and could easily provide unreliable food for unbridled imaginations. One may believe implicitly in certain things, but especially if they have an ancient religious basis, it may not always be possible to prove them. Such ideas merit attention.|May H. Beattie, ''Carpets of central Persia'', 1976, p. 19}}

Oriental rugs from various proveniences often share common motifs. Various attempts have been made to determine the potential origin of these ornaments. Woven motifs of folk art undergo changes through processes depending on human creativity, trial and error, and unpredictable mistakes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Vavilov's theory of origins|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1994|volume=14|issue=6|pages=12–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also through the more active process of stylization. The latter process is well documented, as the integration into the work of rural village and nomad weavers of patterns designed in town manufactures can be followed on carpets which still exist. In the more archaic motifs, the process of pattern migration and evolution cannot be documented, because the material evidence does not exist any more. This has led to various speculations about the origins and “meanings” of patterns, often resulting in unsubstantiated claims.

==== Prehistoric symbolism ====

In 1967, the British archaeologist James Mellaart claimed to have found the oldest records of flat woven [[kilim]]s on wall paintings he discovered in the [[Çatalhöyük]] excavations, dated to circa 7000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dyson|first1=R. H.|title=Catal Huyuk. A Neolithic Town in Anatolia. James Mellaart. McGraw-Hill, New York, 1967. 232 pp., illus. $9.95|journal=Science|date=22 September 1967|volume=157|issue=3795|pages=1419–1420|doi=10.1126/science.157.3795.1419}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The drawings Mellaart claimed to have made before the wall paintings disappeared after their exposure showed clear similarities to nineteenth century designs of Turkish flatweaves. He interpreted the forms, which evoked a female figure, as evidence of a Mother Goddess cult in Çatalhöyük. A well-known pattern in Anatolian kilims, sometimes referred to as ''[[Elibelinde]]'' (lit.: “hands on hips”), was therefore determined to depict the Mother Goddess herself. This theory had to be abandoned after Mellaarts claims were denounced as fraudulent,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marlamallett.com/ch.htm Oriental Rug Review, August/September 1990 (Vol. 10, No. 6)]&lt;/ref&gt; and his claims refuted by other archaeologists. The elibelinde motif lost its divine meaning and prehistoric origin. It is today understood as a design of stylized carnation flowers, and its development can be traced back in a detailed and unbroken line to Ottoman court carpets of the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt;

==== Apotropaic symbols ====

[[File:Amulet Kilim Motif.jpg|thumb|[[Amulet]] (Muska) [[kilim motifs|kilim motif]], for protection (3 examples)]]

Symbols of protection against evil are frequently found on Ottoman and later Anatolian carpets. The Turkish name for these symbols is ''nazarlık'' (lit.: "[protection from] the evil eye"). [[Apotropaic magic|Apotropaic]] symbols include the [[Cintamani]] motif, often depicted on white ground [[Ushak carpet|Selendi]] carpets, which consists of three balls and a pair of wavy stripes. It serves the same purpose as protective inscriptions like "May God protect", which are seen woven into rugs. Another protective [[Kilim motifs|symbol often woven into carpets]] is the triangular talisman pendant, or "''muska''". This symbol is found in Anatolian, Persian, Caucasian and Central Asian carpets.&lt;ref name="Denny, Islamic carpets, 2014"/&gt;

==== Tribal symbols ====
Some carpets include symbols which serve as a tribal crest and sometimes allow for the identification of the weaver's tribe. This is especially true for Turkmen pile woven textiles, which depict a variety of different medallion-like polygonal patterns called [[Gul (design)|Gul]], arranged in rows all over the field. While the origin of the pattern can be traced back to Buddhist depictions of the lotus blossom,&lt;ref name="Eberhart Herrmann"/&gt; it remains questionable if the weaver of such a tribal symbol was aware of its origins.

==== "Kufic" borders ====

Early Anatolian carpets often show a geometric border design with two arrowhead-like extensions in a sequence of tall-short-tall. By its similarity to the [[kufic]] letters of alif and lām, borders with this ornament are called "kufic" borders. The letters are thought to represent the word “[[Allah]]”. Another theory relates the tall-short-tall ornament to split-palmette motifs. The "alif-lām" motif is already seen on early Anatolian carpets from the [[Eşrefoğlu Mosque]] in [[Beyşehir]].&lt;ref name="Balpinar, 1988"/&gt;

==== Symbolism of the prayer rug ====
[[File:Shirvan 01.jpg|thumb|Shirvan Prayer rug with a rectangular niche, depicting inwoven hands and an ornament representing the mosque lamp]]

The symbolism of the Islamic [[Prayer rug]] is more easily understandable. A prayer rug is characterized by a niche at one end, representing the [[mihrab]] in every mosque, a directional point to direct the [[worship]]per towards [[Mecca]]. Often one or more [[mosque lamp]]s hang from the point of the arch, a reference to the [[Verse of Light]] in the [[Qur'an]]. Sometimes a comb and pitcher are depicted, which is a reminder for Muslims to wash their hands and for men to comb their hair before performing prayer. Stylized hands are woven in the rug pile, indicating where the hands should be placed when performing prayer, often also interpreted as the [[Hamsa]], or “Hand of Fatima”, a protective amulet against the [[evil eye]].

=== Cultural effects of commercialization ===

Since the beginning of the Oriental rug trade in the High Middle Ages, Western market demand has influenced the rug manufacturers producing for export, who had to adapt their production in order to accommodate Western market demands. The commercial success of oriental rugs, and the [[Mercantilism|mercantilistic]] thinking which arose during the sixteenth century, led European sovereigns to initiate and promote carpet manufactories in their European home countries. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, Western companies set up weaving facilities in the rug-producing countries, and commissioned designs specifically invented according to Western taste.

Rugs exist which are known to be woven in European manufactories as early as the mid sixteenth century, imitating the technique and, to some extent, the designs of Oriental rugs. In [[Swedish carpets and rugs|Sweden]], flat and pile woven rugs (called “''[[Rya (rug)|rya]]''”, or “''rollakan''”) became part of the folk art, and are still produced today, mostly in modern designs. In other countries, like Poland or Germany, the art of carpet weaving did not last long. In the United Kingdom, [[Axminster Carpets|Axminster carpets]] were produced since the mid-eighteenth century. In France, the [[Savonnerie manufactory]] began weaving pile carpets by the mid-seventeenth centuries, but turned to European-style designs later on, which in turn influenced the Anatolian rug production during the “''mecidi''”, or “Turkish baroque” period. The Manchester-based company [[Ziegler &amp; Co.]] maintained workshops in [[Tabriz]] and [[Arak, Iran|Sultanabad]] (now Arak) and supplied retailers such as [[Liberty &amp; Company]] and [[Harvey Nichols]]. Their designs were modifications of the traditional Persian. A. C. Edwards was the manager of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers' operations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mansel|first1=Antony Wynn ; with a foreword by Philip|title=Three camels to Smyrna: times of war and peace in Turkey, Persia, India, Afghanistan &amp; Nepal, 1907-1986 : the story of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers Company|date=2008|publisher=Hali|location=London|isbn=9781898113676}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Persia from 1908 to 1924, and wrote one of the classical textbooks about the Persian carpet.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A.

In the late nineteenth century, the Western invention of synthetic [[dye]]s had a devastating effect on the traditional way of carpet production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bode|first1=Wilhelm von|title=Vorderasiatische Knüpfteppiche aus alter Zeit|date=1902|publisher=Klinkhardt &amp; Biermann|location=Munich|isbn=3-7814-0247-9|page=158 ff|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Neugebauer, R |author2=Orendi, J|title=Handbuch der Orientalischen Teppichkunde|date=1920|publisher=Karl W.

The traditional design of the Saruk rug was modified by the weavers towards an allover design of detached floral motives, the carpets were then chemically washed to remove the unwanted colours, and the pile was painted over again with more desirable colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian Carpet|date=1953|publisher=Gerald Duckworth % Co., Ltd|location=London|pages=141–142|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its home countries, the ancient art and craft of carpet weaving has been revived. Since the early 1980s, initiatives were ongoing like the [[DOBAG Carpet Initiative|DOBAG project]] in Turkey, in Iran,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and by various social projects in Afghanistan and amongst Tibetan refugees in Northern India. Naturally dyed, traditionally woven rugs are available on the Western market again.&lt;ref name="Eilland, 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Emmett|title=Oriental Rugs Today|date=2003|publisher=Berkeley Hills Books, Albany, CA|isbn=1-893163-46-6|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the end of the U.S. [[Sanctions against Iran|embargo]] on Iranian goods, also Persian carpets (including antique carpets sold at auctions) may become more easily available to U.S. customers again.

=== Forgery ===
Oriental rugs have always attracted collectors' interest, and sold at high prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/persian-rug-carpet-sells-world-record-price-475630 |title=Persian Rug Sells For World Record $33.7m |publisher=International Business Times |first=Hannah |last=Osborne |work=ibtimes.co.uk |date=16 June 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has also been an incentive for fraudulent behaviour.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"/&gt; Techniques used traditionally in rug restoration, like replacing knots, or re-weaving parts of a rug, can also be used to modify a rug so as to appear older or more valuable than it actually is. Old flatweaves can be unravelled to obtain longer threads of yarn which can then be re-knitted into rugs.

== Rugs by regions ==
Oriental rugs can be classified by their region of origin, each of which represents different strands of tradition: [[Persian rug]]s, [[Pakistani rug]]s, [[Arabian carpet|Arabian rug]]s, [[Turkish carpet|Anatolian rug]]s, [[Kurdish rug]]s, [[Caucasian carpets and rugs|Caucasian rugs]], Central Asian rugs, [[Turkish rug|Turkestanian (Turkmen, Turkoman) rugs]], [[Chinese rug]]s, [[Tibetan rug]]s and Indian rugs.

=== Persian (Iranian) rugs ===

{{main article|Persian carpet}}
The Persian carpet or Persian rug is an essential and distinguished part of [[Persian culture]] and [[Persian art|art]], and dates back to [[Persian Empire|ancient Persia]].
Persian carpets are classified by the social setting in which they were woven (nomads, villages, town and court manufactories), by ethnic groups (e.g. [[Kurds]], nomadic tribes such as the [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]] or [[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiari]]; [[Afshar people|Afshari]], [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]], [[Turkmens]]) and others, or by the town or province where carpets are woven, such as [[Heriz]], [[Hamadan]], [[Senneh]], [[Bijar (city)|Bijar]], [[Arak, Iran|Arak]] (Sultanabad), [[Mashhad]], [[Isfahan]], [[Kashan]], [[Qom]], [[Nain, Iran|Nain]], and others. A technical classification for Persian carpets is based on material used for warps, wefts, and pile, spinning and plying of the yarn, dyeing, weaving technique, and aspects of finishing including the ways how the sides (selvedges) and ends are reinforced against wear.

=== Anatolian (Turkish) rugs ===
{{main article|Turkish carpet}}
Turkish carpets are produced mainly in [[Anatolia]], including neighbouring areas. Carpet weaving is a traditional art in Anatolia, dating back to pre-Islamic times, and integrates different cultural traditions reflecting the history of [[Turkic peoples]]. Turkish carpets form an essential part of the Turkish culture.

Amongst Oriental rugs, the Turkish carpet is distinguished by particular characteristics of dyes and colours, designs, textures and techniques. Usually made of wool and cotton, Turkish carpets are tied with the [[Ghiordes knot|Turkish]], or symmetrical knot. The earliest known examples for Turkish carpets date from the thirteenth century. Distinct types of carpets have been woven ever since in workshops, in more provincial weaving facilities, as well as in villages, tribal settlements, or by nomads. Carpets were simultaneously produced for these different levels of society, with varying materials like sheep wool, cotton, and silk. Pile woven as well as flat woven carpets ([[Kilim]], [[Soumak rug|Soumak]], Cicim, Zili) have attracted collectors' and scientists' interest.
Following a decline which began in the second half of the nineteenth century, initiatives like the [[DOBAG Carpet Initiative]] in 1982, or the [[Turkish Cultural Foundation]] in 2000, started to revive the traditional art of Turkish carpet weaving by using hand-spun, naturally-dyed wool and traditional designs.&lt;ref name="TCF Natural Dyes Laboratory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkish Cultural Foundation|url=http://www.tcfdatu.org/en/home/|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turkish carpet is distinct from carpets of other provenience in that it makes more pronounced use of primary colours. Western Anatolian carpets prefer red and blue colours, whereas Central Anatolian use more red and yellow, with sharp contrasts set in white. With the exceptions of representative court and town manufacture designs, Turkish carpets make more pronounced use of bold geometric, and highly stylized floral patterns, generally in rectilinear design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McMullan|first1=Joseph V.|title=Islamic Carpets|date=1965|publisher=Near Eastern Art Research Center|location=New York|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Egyptian Mamluk rugs ===
[[File:The Baillet-Latour Mamluk Carpet.jpg|thumb|The Baillet-Latour Mamluk Carpet]]

Under the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt]], a distinctive carpet was produced in Egypt. Called "Damascene" carpets by previous centuries, there is no doubt now that the center of production was [[Cairo]].&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Kairener Teppiche Teil I.

European and Islamic Sources from the 15.-18. Century|publisher=Freer Gallery of Art, The Smithsonian Institution and Department of the History of Art, University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to nearly all other oriental rugs, Mamluk carpets used “S” (clockwise) spun and “Z” (anti-clockwise)-plied wool. Their palette of colours and shades is limited to bright red, pale blue, and light green, blue and yellow are rarely found. The field design is characterized by polygonal medallions and stars and stylized floral patterns, arranged in a linear way along their central axis, or centralized. The borders contain rosettes, often alternating with cartouches. As [[Edmund de Unger]] pointed out, the design is similar to other products of Mamluk manufacture, like wood- and metal work, and book bindings, [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated books]] and floor mosaics.&lt;ref name="de Unger, Mamluk"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Unger|first1=Edmund|title=The Origin of the Mamluk Carpet Design|journal=Hali|date=1980|volume=2|issue=4|pages=321–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mamluk carpets were made for the court, and for export, Venice being the most important market place for Mamluk rugs in Europe.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

After the 1517 [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt]], two different cultures merged, as is seen on Mamluk carpets woven after this date. The Cairene weavers adopted an Ottoman Turkish design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ottoman-Cairene carpet in the Met. Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/452308|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of these carpets continued in Egypt, and probably also in Anatolia, into the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinner|first1=R.|last2=Franses|first2=M.|title=East Mediterranean carpets in the Victoria and Albert Museum|journal=Hali|date=1981|volume=IV|issue=1|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Caucasian rugs ===
{{main article|Caucasian carpets and rugs}}
{{See also|Armenian carpet|Azerbaijani rug}}
[[File:Azeri carpet-maker.jpg|thumb|Azerbaijani woman makes a carpet. Early 20th century]]
The Caucasian provinces of [[Karabagh]], Moghan, [[Shirvan]], [[Daghestan]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] formed the northern territories of the [[Safavid Empire]]. In the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1724)]] and the [[Treaty of Gulistan]], 1813, the provinces were finally ceded to Russia. Russian rule was further extended to [[Baku]], [[Genje]], the [[Derbent]] khanate, and the region of [[Talish]]. In the 19th century the main weaving zone of the Caucasus was in the eastern Transcaucasus south of the mountains that bisect the region diagonally, in a region which today comprises [[Azerbaijan]]. In 1990, Richard E. Wright claimed that ethnicities other than the [[Turkic peoples|Turk]] [[Azerbaijani people|Azeri population]] "also practiced weaving, some of them in other parts of the Caucasus, but they were of lesser importance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Richard E.|title=Carpets xv. Caucasian Carpets – Encyclopaedia Iranica|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/carpets-xv|website=www.iranicaonline.org|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian population surveys from 1886 and 1897&lt;ref&gt;cited in Eiland &amp; Eiland, 1998, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that the ethnic distribution of the population is extremely complex in the southern Caucasus. With regard to antique carpets and rugs, the weavers' identity or ethnicity remains unknown. Eiland &amp; Eiland stated in 1998 that "it should not be taken for granted that the majority population in a particular area was also responsible for the weaving."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eiland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eiland|first2=Murray|title=Oriental rugs : a complete guide|date=2008|publisher=Laurence King|location=London|isbn=9781856691321|page=263|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a variety of theories about the ethnic origin of carpet patterns, and a variety of classifications have been put forward, sometimes attributing one and the same carpet to different ethnic groups. The debate is still ongoing, and remains unresolved.

In 1728 the Polish Jesuit Thaddaeus Krusinski wrote that at the beginning of the seventeenth century Shah [[Abbas I of Persia]] had established carpet manufactories in Shirvan and Karabagh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tadeusz Jan Krusiński |first1=T.

Characteristic motifs include stylized Chinese dragons in the so-called '''“Dragon carpets”''', combat scenes of tigers and stags, or floral motifs. The style is highly abstract to an extent that the animal forms become unrecognizable, unless compared to earlier Safavid animals and 16th century "vase style" carpets depicting the same motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=von Bode |first1=Wilhelm |last2=Kühnel |first2=Ernst |title=Vorderasiatische Knüpfteppiche / Antique Rugs from the Near East, tra.

Among the most popular groups of Caucasian rugs are the '''“Star Kazak”'''&lt;ref name="Franses &amp; Pinner, 1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=D. |last2=Franses |first2=M. |last3=Pinner |first3=R. |title=Caucasian Carpets in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum |journal=Hali |date=1980 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=17–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kirchheim |first1=H. |title=Orient Stars.

A precise classification of Caucasian rugs is particularly difficult, even compared to other types of oriental rugs. Virtually no information is available from before the end of the nineteenth century, when Caucasian rugs began to be exported in larger numbers. In the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] socialistic economy, carpet production was organized in industrial lines in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Daghestan and Georgia, which used standardized designs based on traditional motifs, provided on scalepaper cartoons by specialized artists.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; In 1927, the Azerbaijani Carpet Association was founded as a division of the Azerbaijani Art Association. At their factories, wool and cotton were processed and handed out to the weavers, who had to join the association.&lt;ref name="Zollinger, 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zollinger|first1=Werner|last2=Kerimov|first2=Latif|last3=Azadi|first3=Siawosh U.|title=Azerbaijani-Caucasian rugs|date=2001|publisher=Ulmke Collection|location=Switzerland|isbn=978-3925813108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Azerbaijani scholar [[Latif Karimov]] wrote&lt;ref name="Zollinger, 2001"/&gt; that between 1961 and 1963, a technical college devoted to teaching carpet weaving was built, in 1961, the National Azerbaijan M.A. Aliev Institute of Art opened a department headed by Karimov, which specialized on the training of carpet designers.

Detailed ethnographic information is available from the works of ethnologists like [[Vsevolod Miller]] and Soviet Russian surveys conducted by the [[Institute of Anthropology and Ethnography]] (cited in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Field|first1=H.|title=Contributions to the Anthropology of the Caucasus.|journal=Papers of the Peabody Museum of American Archaeology and Ethnology|date=1953|volume=1|issue=48|publisher=Harvard University|location=Cambridge, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) However, during the long period of industrial production, the connection between specific designs and their ethnic and geographic origins may have been lost. Research was published mainly in Russian language, and still is not fully available to non-Russian speaking scientists.&lt;ref name="Zollinger, 2001"/&gt; From a Western perspective, when scientific interest started to develop in Oriental rugs by the end of the nineteenth century, the Caucasian regions, being part of the Soviet Union, closed up to the West. Thus, Western information about carpet weaving in the Caucasian countries was not as detailed as from other regions of the "carpet belt".&lt;ref name="Franses &amp; Pinner, 1980"/&gt;

Different classifications have been proposed, however, many trade names and labels have been kept merely as terms of convenience, and future research may allow for more precise classification.&lt;ref name="Schurmann, Caucasian 1974"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schurmann|first1=Ulrich|title=Caucasian Rugs.|date=1974|publisher=Crosby|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0903580151|edition=3rd impr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright, Caucasus 1980"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Richard E.|title=Rugs and flatweaves of the Transcaucasus : a commentary|date=1980|publisher=[s.n.]|location=Pittsburgh, Pa.|isbn=978-0960421008|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, archival research from earlier Russian and Soviet sources has been included,&lt;ref name="Wright and Wertime, Caucasian 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Richard E.|last2=Wertime|first2=John T.|title=Caucasian carpets &amp; covers : the weaving culture|date=1995|publisher=Hali Publ. in ass. with King|location=London|isbn=978-1856690775}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cooperations were initiated between Western and Azerbaijani experts.&lt;ref name="Zollinger, 2001"/&gt; They propose the study of flatweaves as the major indigenous folk art of the Caucasus, and worked on more specific and detailed classifications.

==== Classification by Zollinger, Karimov, and Azadi ====

Zollinger, Kerimov and Azadi propose a classification for Caucasian rugs woven from the late 19th century onwards.&lt;ref name="Zollinger, 2001"/&gt; Essentially, they focus on six provenances:

* '''Kuba''' relates to a district and its town, located between Baku and Derbent, the Samur river constituting its northern, the southern crest of the Caucasus its southern border.Kuba borders the Baku district in the southeast, and the Caspian Sea n the east. Kuba rugs are classified as town rugs, with dense ornamentation, high knot density, and short pile. Warps are made of wool, not dyed and dark ivory. Wefts are of wool, wool and cotton, or cotton. One of two wefts is often deeply depressed. Knots are symmetrical. Plain-woven Soumakh ends of dark wool or light blue cotton are frequent, white cotton soumakhs are rare. The fringes are braided, pleated, or artistically knotted. The selvedges are mainly round (in that case, in dark blue wool) or 0.3–1&amp;nbsp;cm wide and made of light blue wool, reinforced over two ribs by figure-of-eight wrapping with supplemental threads. The colours are dark and the rugs look hardly polychrome despite the fact that they use 10–12 different colours, because their ornaments are small and arranged densely on the rug. The majority of Kuba rugs have a dark blue background. Red or dark red rarely occur, sometimes ivory, rarely yellow and hardly any green.
* '''Shirvan''' is the name of the town and province, located on the western coast of the Caspian Sea, east of the Kura river, between the southern part of the river and the city of Derbent in the north. Kerimov distinguished six districts, which weave different types of rugs. Some Shirvan rugs come with a high knot density and short pile. More coarsely woven carpets have a higher pile. Symmetrical knots are used, woven with alternate warps depressed. The weft is generally of wool, in dark ivory to brown. The ends are flat-woven, light cotton or wool sumakh. The fringes are sometimes artistically knotted. The selvedges are either round, or 0.5–1&amp;nbsp;cm wide, in white cotton, with 2–3 ribs in figure-of-eight wrapping with supplemental threads. White cotton selvedges are the most common in Shirvan rugs. Shirvan rugs may have town, or village designs, but less densely ornamented as compared to Kuba rugs, and the drawing is more sparse. Compared to Kuba rugs, Shirvan rugs are lighter, and more colourful, with a dark blue background. The borders often have a light background which is more sparsely ornamented compared to the central field. Light ivory, red or yellow rarely occur. Ivory is mainly used for prayer rugs.
* '''Gyanya''' (Genje) is a large city, located ca. {{convert|360|km|abbr=off}} west of Baku.In contrast to the more urban design of Kuba and Shirvan, rugs from other provenances have longer piles. On average, the pile of Gyanya rugs is 6–15&amp;nbsp;mm high. The warp is generally darker, mainly wool, not dyed dark or light brown. Camel hair is said to be used for warps as well. Wefts are commonly dyed light to dark brownish red. Three wefts are often shot in after each row of knots, but warps are not depressed. The upper end is often {{convert|2|-|6|cm|abbr=on}} long brownish-red tapestry weave, turned over and sewn on. The lower end is frequently red woolen tapestry weave, with the warp loops uncut. Selvedges are rarely round, but flat and wide, mainly dark brownish red, and consist of three ribs with figure-of-eight wrapping with supplemental threads. The second most common shape is similar, but includes only two ribs. Gyanya rugs are more generously and sparsely ornamented, as compared to Kuba and Shirvan weavings. Large square, rectangular, hexagonal and octagonal patterns are set within more open space. Medallions (gul) are often hooked. The colour palette is more restricted than in Kuba and Shirvan rugs, but distributed over larger areas, so that the overall impression is more colourful.
* '''Kazak''' according to Latimov refers to a district and its center town located between the borders of the Azerbaijan Republic towards the northwest into the Republic of Georgia and towards the southwest into the Republic of Armenia. The city of Kasak lies {{convert|460|km|abbr=off}} west of Baku. The warp of Kazak rugs is of sheep wool, not dyed, rather dark ivory, sometimes camel hair is said to be used. The weft is of wool, or a blend of wool and camel hair. Sometimes wool and cotton threads are only slightly plied together to form the warp thread. Wefts are dyed mostly in light red, wefts in dark blue distinguish the Kazak from Karabakh rugs. 2–6 wefts are shot in after each row of knots. The pile is wool, sometimes undyed camel hair, the knots being symmetrical, the warps not depressed. Kazak rugs are woven more coarsely, their pile being 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm high. The upper end is fastened with a 1–4&amp;nbsp;cm wide woolen tapestry weave in red colours. The lower end is often finished like the upper end, but uncut warp loops are often seen protruding from the flat-woven end. Selvedges are nearly always flat nd between 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm wide, consisting of two ribs in figure-of-eight wrapping with supplemental threads, these often in different colours. In most cases, two double warps are wrapped three times. Kazak rugs have a limited colour palette of 5–7 colours. In general, the field has a red background, less frequently also ivory, green, blue, or yellow, the colour of the main border often in contrasting colours. The colour of the main borders is often difficult to identify due to the dense ornamentation. Kazak rugs woven before ca. 1910 have more intense and bright colours than rugs woven after this year.
* '''Karabagh''' extends between the rivers Kura and Araz up to the mountains of the small Caucasus. The rugs woven in the different regions of the Karabagh area differ substantially from each other. Rugs from the easternmost parts of the Karabagh area have cotton wefts and light blue cotton or wool selvedges. In some regions (Mokan, Talysh, Lenkoran) the rugs have runner formats, approximately three times as long as wide. Apart from manufacture rugs, Karabagh rugs have a high pile, up to 2&amp;nbsp;cm. According to Karimov, some types of rugs like the "Eagle Kazak", Cloud band Kazak, or Kasymushak Kazaks, have actually been woven in Karabagh. Their upper and lower ends are often fllat-woven, folded towards the back, and sewn on.
* '''Nakhichevan''' is located between Armenia and Iran. No information was available on this region to the authors of this classification.

=== Turkmen rugs ===
{{main article|Turkmen rug}}
{{see also|Yomut carpet}}

[[File:Gorskii 20005u.jpg|thumbnail|right|Two Turkmen men standing on a ''Halı'' main carpet with Tekke göl, in front of a [[yurt]]. (1905-1915)]]

[[Turkmen people|Turkmen tribes]] inhabited the area between the [[Amu Darya]] river, the [[Caspian Sea]], [[Aral Sea]] and towards the borders of modern-time Iran and Afghanistan. They produced rugs and smaller pile woven textiles in various sizes, including main carpets (''halı''), tent door hangings (''ensi''), and other household items like tent door decorations (''khalyk'' or ''kapunuk''), tent bags (''torba''), large bags (''chuval''), smaller bags (''mafrash''), saddle bags (''Khordjin''), animal covers (''[[asmalyk]]''), and tent bands.

Many archaic components of Turkmen representative arts have survived into the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Tsareva, 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tsareva|first1=Elena|title=Turkmen Carpets: Masterpieces of Steppe Art, from 16th to 19th Centuries: The Hoffmeister Collection|date=2011|publisher=Arnoldsche Art Publishers|location=Stuttgart|isbn=9783897903425|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Turkmen were an ancient, Iranian-speaking ethnicity in the western Central Asian steppes and oases. Their military administrative organization in tribes was traced back to the influence of the [[Huns]].(&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atayev|first1=K.|title=Nekotorye dannye po etnografii turkmen shikov|journal=Studies of the Institute of Ethnography and Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of the TSSR|volume=VII|trans-title=Some ethnographic data on the Turkmen shikhs|location=Ashkabad|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; cited in&lt;ref name="Ahmed, 1984"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahmed|first1=Akbar S.|title=Islam in tribal societies : from the Atlas to the Indus|date=1984|publisher=Routledge &amp; Paul|location=London u.a.|isbn=978-0710093202|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Turkish influence came with the [[Hephthalite Empire]] in the sixth century AD, and, to a larger extent, by the immigration of the [[Oghuz Turks]] in the ninth and tenth century AD. The Oghuz assimilated the local population, who converted to Islam.&lt;ref name="Ahmed, 1984"/&gt; The [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol invasion]] of the thirteenth century AD led to the destruction of the cities and agricultural irrigation systems, and reduced the Turkmen people to a nomadic lifestyle which they have kept throughout their later history, living at the borders of more powerful states like the [[Persian Empire]], the [[Khwarazmian dynasty]], and the [[Khanate of Bukhara]]. Less amenable to assimilation than their neighbours, they were able to preserve much of their traditional culture. During the nineteenth century, the Turkmen came under the influence of the [[Russian Empire]]. With the end of the [[Soviet Union]], the former Turkmen socialist republic turned into the independent state of [[Turkmenistan]].

The [[History of Turkmenistan|history of the Turkmen]] tribes is characterized by migrations, alliances, intertribal warfare, even by the violent extinction of regional populations. Knowledge of both the history of a Turkmen tribe and its migrations, and the characteristics of their structure and design, often allows for the attribution of a rug or pile-woven household item to a certain tribe, and to a certain period in its history. The diversity of the colours and ornaments, as well as their potential symbolic meaning, constitutes the subject of a large, sometimes controversial, body of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jourdan|first1=Uwe|title=Oriental rugs Vol. V: Turkoman|date=1989|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|isbn=978-1851491360|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinner|first1=Robert|last2=Eilland, Jr.|first2=Murray J.|title=Between the Black Desert and the Red : Turkmen carpets from the Wiedersperg collection ; [published on the occasion of an Exhibition Between the Black Desert and the Red - Turkmen Carpets from the Wiedersperg Collection, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, M.

Typical for nomadic weaving, the wool of Turkmen rugs is of high quality, with a fairly long pile. Sheep wool, goat's hair and cotton are used for the foundation. The pile is made from wool, and often also contains silk. The predominant colour in nearly all Turkmen rugs is [[Rubia tinctorum|madder red]], which was obtained locally, and allows for dyeing in various shades. The different tribes used distinct shades of red. The predominance of the red colour in Turkmen rugs creates a monotonous impression on first sight, but the minor ornaments are woven in a great variety of colours. The most prominent ornament in Turkmen rugs is the [[Gul (design)|gul]], a medallion-like polygonal pattern which is arranged in rows all over the field. Specific gul were used as tribal emblems in a [[Heraldry|heraldic]] manner.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moshkova|first1=Valentina G.|editor1-last=O' Bannon|editor1-first=George|editor2-last=Amanova Olsen|editor2-first=Ovadan K.|title=Carpets of the people of Central Asia of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries|date=1996|publisher=O'Bannon|location=Tucson|isbn=9780965342100|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, main (termed “göl”&lt;ref name="O'Bannon"/&gt;), and secondary, less elaborate gul (termed “gül”&lt;ref name="O'Bannon"/&gt;) can be distinguished, “gul” being the more generic name for this type of ornament. Gul were also used depending on the type of rug or household item. Main carpets usually display the main göl of the tribe, whereas tent door covers and bags show special gul.&lt;ref name="Tsareva, 2011"/&gt;

Primary göl in Turkmen rugs include:&lt;ref name="Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Bannon|first1=George W.|title=The Turkoman carpet|date=1974|publisher=Duckworth|location=London|isbn=978-0715607404}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gülli or gushli göl: Lobed göl which includes a square ornament, from which tre-foiled ornaments on a stem protrude. Used by the Tekke, Salor and Ersari, and by some weavers of the Saryk. “Gülli” means "flower" in Turkmen, “gushli” (from “kush” or “gush”) means “bird”. 
* Tauk-Nuska göl: Divided into four quarters in diagonally opposed colours, each quarter shows two stylized animals. Common in many tribes, it is mainly used by Arabachi, Chodor, some groups of the Yomud and Ersari including the Kizil Ayak.
* Tekke göl: Design variation of the gülli göl. Round shape set on the coordinates of a dark blue lattice, which divides each gül into four sections with diagonally opposed colours.
* Saryk göl: Similar to the Tekke göl, but not arranged on a lattice framework. Often seen on Saryk main carpets, also called Chuval göl because of its use on large bags (''chuval'').
* Dyrnak göl - literally: “Comb göl”. Rhomboid göl adorned with rows of hooks, resembling combs, opposite rows of hooks are in the same colour. Used by the Yomud tribe
* Kepse göl: Used mainly by the Yomud tribe, rhomboid göl surrounded by two-coloured crenellations.
* Eagle göl: At least two, if not three groups of rugs are distinguished by this design feature, which has not yet been attributed to any specific tribe.
* "C" göls: Octagon within an octagon filled with patterns resembling the letter “C”.

Turkmen carpets can be woven with both symmetric, and asymmetric knots, open to the left and to the right. Irregular knots are also frequent, including missed warps, knots over three or four warps, single warp knots, or knots sharing one warp, are seen, both symmetric and asymmetric. Often warps are deeply depressed. Pile, warp and weft yarns are excellently balanced. The ratio between horizontal and vertical knots is frequently close to 1:1. Rugs woven in this manner are very dense and durable.&lt;ref name="Tsareva, 2011"/&gt;

The '''Salor''' confederation (consisting mainly of the Salor proper and Saryk) is believed to have lived originally in the Amu Darya valley, and the oases of southern Turkmenistan, including [[Merv]]. They used bright shades of madder red. The typical Salor göl has a lobed rosette shade, upright-cross division and motif-filling. Its four central quarters are dyed in diagonally opposed colours. The style of colouring is labelled “Central Asian”. The göl are arranged on the main field of a carpet in a way that makes them appear to “float” on the field, creating the impression of a diagonal movement.&lt;ref name="Tsareva, 2011"/&gt; A group of Turkmen carpets with common structural features were termed “'''S-group'''” and identified as Salor rugs by Mackie and Thompson.&lt;ref name="Mackie &amp; Thompson, Tribal carpets"/&gt; The carpets of the “S-group” are asymmetrically knotted, open to the left. Warps are ivory, with alternate warps deeply depressed, wefts of two-ply brown wool, occasionally dyed red. Their pile is less supple than other Turkmen rugs, fairly long. Sometimes silk is used, but rarely cotton. Red colour is mostly from madder, but lac and cochineal reds have been found.&lt;ref name="Mackie &amp; Thompson, Tribal carpets"/&gt; Older Saryk weavings often have symmetric knots.

'''Tekke''' rugs are distinguished by the use of the Tekke göl. They are asymmetrically knotted, almost always open to the right. Alternate warps are rarely deeply depressed. The red colours are dyed in madder, but also cochineal red can be found. In the nineteenth century, synthetic dyes have been used. Warps are often of ivory yarn with a large component of ivory goat's hair. The selvage is overcast in dark blue.&lt;ref name="Rautenstengel, 1990"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rautenstengel|first1=Anette|last2=Rautenstengel|first2=Volker|last3=Pakbin|first3=Ali|title=Studien zur Teppich-Kultur der Turkmen = Studies on Turkmen Carpet Culture|date=1990|publisher=A. Rautenstengel|location=Hilden|isbn=978-3980259606|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Yomud''' rugs are of a similar structure, with less depressed warps. The red field colour of Yomud rugs is more subdued with a brown hue. Knots are asymmetric, open to the left. Typical göl are ''dyrnak'' and ''kepse'' göl.&lt;ref name="Rautenstengel, 1990"/&gt;
The most common field colour of '''Chaudor''' rugs is a purplish chestnut brown. White appears more prominently, also dark and light blue, green and yellow. The warps are made of dark wool, whereas the wefts include white cotton. Knotting is asymmetrical and open to the right, which helps distinguishing Chaudor from Yomud rugs. Tauk nuska göls are common in Chaudor rugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Munkacsi|first1=Kurt|title=Dividing the Chaudor|journal=Hali|date=1994|issue=26|pages=96–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other carpet weaving tribes include the Arabatchi, Ersari and Beshiri.

==== Commercialization and revival ====

With the beginning of commercialization in the nineteenth century, carpets were produced for export in Russia and Afghanistan. Known under the trade name of “Bokhara rugs”, they show designs inspired by Turkmen carpets, but the colours and the quality of design did not match the original. With the end of the Soviet Union, national states were established in the area. Within general activities to revive the ancient tradition of hand-spinning, natural dyeing, and hand weaving, projects to support refugees from Afghanistan have taken a part in the “carpet renaissance”.&lt;ref name="Eilland, 2003"/&gt;

The two states, India and Pakistan, separated in 1947 at the [[Partition of India]]. The tradition of carpet weaving, however, was common to the Indian subcontinent. Therefore, they are described together in this section. Unless otherwise indicated, "India" in this section refers to the Indian subcontinent.

Rug weaving was known in India at least since the sixteenth century. The original models were probably Persian, since their designs appear closely related. Other influences came from central Asia, but India soon developed a style of her own. The most elaborate carpets were woven under the [[Mughal Empire]] during the late sixteenth and the first half of the eighteenth century. Further southwards, the rugs woven in the Deccan area are distinguished by their colours and design.

Pile rugs made of wool are not essential household items in the hot and humid climate of India. They might have been introduced by succeeding waves of migrants from central and western Asia. The first people to invade India from the Eurasian steppe were the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Aryans]] at around 1800 BC. The Aryans were nomadic people subsiding on animal breeding. It has been suggested that they might have introduced sheep breeding, and the production of woolen textiles to Northwestern India.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; In the sixth century BC, India was invaded by the [[Hephthalite Empire]], another steppe nomad culture. In the fourth and fifth century BC, some areas were ruled by the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]]. To what extent these peoples were already weaving pile carpets remains unknown, since no carpets exist from this period to support the hypothesis. The earliest references to Indian carpets come from Chinese writers during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907 AD).&lt;ref name="Cohen SJ, 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Stephen J.|editor1-last=Pinner|editor1-first=Robert|editor2-last=Denny|editor2-first=Walter|title=Indian and Kashmiri carpets before Akbar: Their perceived history|journal=Oriental carpet and textile studies|date=1987|volume=III|issue=1|pages=119–126|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Arab invasion of [[Sindh]] in 712, India came in touch with Islam. The Afghan [[Ghaznavids]] and their successors, the [[Ghurid dynasty|Ghaurids]], further spread Islam in India. The Arabian geographer [[Al-Muqaddasi]] mentions carpets from Sindh in 985 AD.&lt;ref name="Cohen SJ, 1987"/&gt; Carpet weaving can with more certainty be traced to the beginning of the Mughal Empire in the early sixteenth century, when the last successor of Timur, [[Babur]], extended his rule from [[Kabul]], Afghanistan to India and founded the [[Mughal Empire]]. Baburs successor, [[Humayun]], took refuge in the Persian Safavid court of Shah [[Tahmasp I]]. Supported by the [[Safavid Empire]], Humayun returned to India. His son, [[Akbar]] the Great extended is power to northern India and [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. Under the patronage of the Mughals, Indian craftsmen adopted Persian techniques and designs.

Miniature paintings from the court of Akbar show that carpets were in use at the Mughal court. During the seventeenth century, commercial records prove the extensive trade in carpets with western Europe. Mughal carpets were depicted in period Netherlandish paintings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ydema|first1=Onno|title=Carpets and their datings in Netherlandish paintings : 1540-1700|date=1991|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|location=Woodbridge|isbn=978-1851491513}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a large number of Indian carpets still exist in European collections.

The majority of Mughal period carpets shows floral motifs, large leaf-and-blossom patterns, on a red field. Depending on their similarities with, e.g., Persian carpet designs, they are sometimes leballed “Indo-Persian”, or “Indo-Isfahan” in the literature. A large collection of Indian carpets existed at [[Jaipur]], where they were studied by T. H. Hendley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hendley|first1=T.H.|title=Asian Carpets: XVI and XVII century designs from the Jaipur palaces|date=1905|publisher=W. Griggs|location=London|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these rugs were labeled, indicating the date of purchase, size, and cost. Most carpets in Jaipur had a cotton foundation, silk was sometimes used for the wefts. White cotton was used for accents in the pile. The finest carpets are often labelled as Persian, but there are carpets with an animal design which are labelled as Indian. The field is frequently dyed with lac, an insect dye resembling cochineal dye. A series of palmettes is often seen along the central vertical axis. On larger carpets, they are flanked by horizontal palmettes pointing alternately to the central axis and to the outer edges. Subsidiary figures are arranged along thin lines of scrolling vinework, usually adorned with lancet-shaped leaves. Several shades of blue are often seen, green, yellow, two different shades of red. Frequently two shades of the same colour are placed closely together with no outlining between the two colours. This feature is regarded as characteristic for Mughal Indian carpets.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

The floral design of Indian carpets is often more naturalistic than in their Persian and other counterparts. This feature is considered typical for carpets woven under [[Jahangir]]. Another typical design is the "millefleurs" design, woven mainly between the seventeenth and nineteenth century. These rugs are very intricately woven, with soft wool and often with silk warps which change their colours across the width of the rug, forming vertical “rainbow” bands across the carpet. The field is covered by a multitude of fine flowerheads connected by fine vinework. Carpets with prayer rug design show elaborate vase-and-flowers arrangements flanked by cypress trees, another feature of Mughal art, also seen in architectural ornaments of Mughal period buildings like the [[Taj Mahal]]. Exact dating of Mughal period carpets is difficult, since few examples have inwoven dates. Rugs were woven in [[Agra]], [[Lahore]], and [[Fatehpur Sikri]].&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

With the decline of the Mughal Empire, by the late nineteenth century, carpet weaving in India had also declined to an extent that the [[British Raj|British]] colonial administration decided to set up factories, sometimes in jails, to produce carpets for export. Carpet weaving continues in India and Pakistan after their separation and independence. Today, the carpet production in India and Pakistan frequently use foreign designs or design copies, and produce commercial rugs of mainly utilitarian value.

== The Oriental rug and the Western world ==
Oriental rugs were probably known to Europe since the [[High Middle Ages]]. Travellers' stories, court annals, home inventories and testaments and, most importantly, paintings bear evidence of rugs and carpets as goods of luxury. As such, they were absorbed into European material culture, providing a context of prestige and dignity which is still understood today.&lt;ref name="Pope's coffin placed on Persian Bijar carpet, 2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pope John Paul II's coffin placed on a Bijar carpet during his funeral mass|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article2919279.ece|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late nineteenth century, art historic and scientific interest in oriental rugs awoke, and they began to be regarded as genuine objects of art. Rugs were collected in museums and by private collectors, and provided the material for scientific research. Nearly every aspect of the manufacture, design, colours, and cultural significance has been, and still is, analyzed and appreciated.

[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - The Ambassadors - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Hans Holbein the Younger - The Ambassadors, 1533 ([[National Gallery, London]]), with a "large pattern Holbein" carpet]]

In the early fourteenth century, [[Marco Polo]] wrote in the [[The Travels of Marco Polo|account of his travels]] about Anatolian rugs. Other thirteenth-century European [[Travel Literature|travellers]] who journeyed to the court of the [[Mongol Empire]] were [[André de Longjumeau]], [[William of Rubruck]] and [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]] with [[Benedykt Polak]]. None of them visited China except Marco Polo. The Moroccan merchant [[Ibn Battuta]] travelled with the [[Golden Horde]] and through China in the early-to-mid-14th century. The 14th-century English author [[John de Mandeville]] wrote an account of his journeys in the East. The travellers sometimes cursorily mention carpets, but only the luxurious carpets which they saw at royal courts seem to have attracted greater interest.

By the late twelfth century, the [[Republic of Venice]], strategically positioned at the head of the Adriatic, became a flourishing trade center. In 1204, [[Enrico Dandolo]], the [[Doge of Venice]], led the Venetian contingent in the [[Fourth Crusade]] which ended in the [[Sack of Constantinople]], and established Venetian predominance in the trade between western Europe and the [[Islamic world]]. Occasional reports appear about carpets and rugs being bought in Venice. In a series of letters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rupprich|first1=Hans (ed.)|title=A. Dürer. Schriftlicher Nachlass|date=1956|publisher=Deutscher Verein für Kunstwissenschaft|location=Berlin|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Venice dated 18 August - 13 October 1506,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Europa und der Orientteppich / Europe and the Oriental Rug|date=1962|publisher=Florian Kupferberg Verlag|location=Mainz|page=49|edition=1st|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Renaissance]] painter [[Albrecht Dürer]] mentions "two nice and large" carpets which he bought for a friend amongst other luxury goods. Objects of courtly representation and prestige initially, oriental rugs became affordable to wider groups of European citizens with the growing wealth and influence of merchant families and private persons. Inventories and testaments of Venetian citizens found in the archives document extensive collection of carpets.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denny|first1=Walter B.|editor1-last=Carboni|editor1-first=Stefano|title=Venice and the Islamic world, 828-1797|date=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=9780300124309|pages=175–191|edition=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oriental rugs are depicted in a large number of [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|Renaissance paintings]].&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"/&gt; Since the late nineteenth century, attempts were made to determine the date when specific rugs were woven, and carpets were identified with designs similar to these reproduced in the paintings. As a rug could not have been woven later than it had appeared in a painting, the age of a carpet can be assessed by this ''“[[Terminus post quem|ante quem]]”'' method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Bode|first1=Wilhelm|last2=Kühnel|first2=Ernst|title=Vorderasiatische Knüpfteppiche / Antique Rugs from the Near East, tra. C. G. Ellis, 1970|date=1985|publisher=Klinkhardt &amp; Biermann|location=München|isbn=3-7814-0247-9|pages=48–51|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the scientists who established the method soon realized that their approach was biased, as it focused on representative carpets. Only these were deemed worthy of being reproduced by artists.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Early Turkish Carpet"/&gt; Village or nomadic rugs were not depicted in paintings aiming to represent dignity and prestige, and not until the mid twentieth century was their artistic and art historic value appreciated in the Western World.

=== Collectors and scientists: late nineteenth century until today ===

In the late nineteenth century, western art historians developed scientifically productive approaches to the Oriental rug.  In 1871, [[Julius Lessing]] published his book on oriental carpet design. He was relying more on European paintings than on the examination of actual carpets, because Oriental carpets were not yet collected when he wrote his book, and he thought that not many ancient carpets had survived. However, Lessing's approach has proven very useful to establish a scientific chronology of Oriental carpet weaving.&lt;ref name="Lessing, Ancient Oriental Carpet Patterns"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lessing|first1=Julius|title=Altorientalische Teppichmuster: Nach Bildern und Originalen des XV. - XVI. Jahrhunderts, translated into English as ''Ancient Oriental Carpet Patterns after Pictures and Originals of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries''. London: H. Sotheran &amp; Co., 1879|date=1877|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collecting of oriental rugs as an art form began in the 1880s.  It was confirmed by two groundbreaking exhibitions. The first took place in Vienna in 1891, focusing on the rugs of the imperial collection of the [[House of Habsburg]], but including specimen from private collections as well.&lt;ref name="1891 Vienna exhibition catalogue"&gt;{{cite book|last1=K. K. Österreichisches Handelsmuseum Wien (Ed.)|title=Katalog der Ausstellung Orientalischer Teppiche im K. K. Österreichischen Handelsmuseum|date=1891|location=Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second was held in London in 1892. For the first time, the [[Ardabil Carpet]] was presented to the public.&lt;ref name="Ardabil carpet, first publication"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stebbing|first1=Edward Percy|title=The holy carpet of the mosque at Ardebil|date=1892|publisher=Robson &amp; Sons|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, the South Kensington Museum (now the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]), advised by [[William Morris]], purchased the Ardabil carpet, recognised today as one of the finest carpets in the world. The high price that was to be paid for the Ardabil carpet required public collection of money, and Oriental rugs came to be understood as objects of great value by a larger audience.

In 1882, Robinson published a book on eastern carpets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=Vincent J.|title=Eastern Carpets: Twelve Early Examples with descriptive notices|date=1882|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he deployed the analytical terms that were emerging in decorative arts scholarship for the elements of carpet design, recognising medallions, floral tracery, cloud bands or the “so-called cloud pattern”, and scrollwork on the outer border.

In 1891, [[Alois Riegl]] published his book about “Ancient Oriental Carpets”.&lt;ref name="Riegl, Ancient oriental carpets, 1892"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riegl|first1=Alois|title=Altorientalische Teppiche|date=1892|publisher=A. Th. Engelhardt|isbn=3-88219-090-6|edition=Reprint 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, Oriental carpets were analyzed in their geographic, cultural, and sociological context, which marks the first time when Oriental rugs were recognized as an art in itself. Following a first essay in 1892,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=von Bode|first1=Wilhelm|title=Ein altpersischer Teppich im Besitz der Königlichen Museen zu Berlin|journal=Jahrbuch der königlich preussischen Kunstsammlungen, Berlin|date=1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; art historian [[Wilhelm von Bode]] published his book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Bode|first1=Wilhelm|last2=Kühnel|first2=Ernst|title=Vorderasiatische Knüpfteppiche / Antique Rugs from the Near East, tr.

Wilhelm von Bode's donation of his carpet collection to the Berlin Museum in 1904-5 was the foundation of the Islamic Museum, Berlin, today the [[Pergamon Museum]]. With Wilhelm von Bode as its first director, his successors [[Friedrich Sarre]], [[Ernst Kühnel]], and [[Kurt Erdmann]] created and established the “Berlin School” of history of Islamic Art. They developed the ''“[[Terminus post quem|ante quem]]”'' method for dating based on Renaissance paintings, recognized the “four social layers” of carpet production (nomadic, village, town and court manufacture) with their different approaches to design and stylization, and established the method of structural analysis to determine the historical framework of the rug weaving traditions within the Islamic world, from a Western perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Pinner, R.: Editorial to "The history of the early Turkish carpet." by K.

The London 1892 exhibition, especially the display of the Ardabil carpet, led to a growing interest in collecting oriental rugs by private collectors, who, mainly in the United States, also started publicly exhibiting their collections. Later on, private collectors donated their collections to museums. U.S. American collectors and philanthropists ([[Charles Yerkes|Charles T. Yerkes]], [[J. P. Morgan]], Joseph L. Williams, [[James F. Ballard]], [[Benjamin Altman]], [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], [[George Hewitt Myers|George H. Myers]] and Joseph V.

[[James F. Ballard]] donated both to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and to the St. Louis Art Museum. [[George Hewitt Myers]] donated his private collection to found the Textile Museum, Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farnham|first1=Thomas J.|title=In pursuit of high standards|journal=Hali|date=2015|volume=Summer 2015|issue=184|pages=52–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major exhibition of oriental rugs in the United States was held in Chicago in 1893. Further exhibitions include the Detroit Institute of Arts, 1922;&lt;ref name="Detroit Exhibition, 1921"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cliff|first1=Vincent D.|title=Loan exhibition of antique oriental rugs; arranged and catalogued for the Detroit institute of arts of the city of Detroit, by Mr. Vincent D.

Many of the dealers who set up booths at these exhibitions then started galleries in America’s major cities. In New York, most of these stores were run by Armenian immigrants and concentrated in lower and mid-town Manhattan. At the turn of the century, the best known stores belonged to [[Dikran Kelekian]], [[Hagop Kevorkian]], S. Kent Costikyan and H. Michaelyan. In 1932, a group of collectors and rug enthusiasts, amongst them Arthur Dilley, Joseph McMullan, and Maurice Dimand, then curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, founded the ''Hajji Baba Club''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hajji Baba Club, New York|url=http://www.hajjibaba.org|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With their exhibitions and publications, they have contributed ever since to the knowledge and appreciation of oriental rugs.

==Parts of the criminal justice system==

# Legislative system &amp;ndash; network of [[legislature]]s that create laws.
# [[Judiciary]] system &amp;ndash; network of [[courts]] that interpret the law in the name of the state, and carry out the administration of [[justice]] in [[Private law|civil]], [[Criminal law|criminal]], and [[Administrative law|administrative]] matters in accordance with the [[rule of law]].&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=David |title=The Oxford companion to law |place=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1980 |page=301 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4GgYAAAAIAAJ |isbn=0-19-866110-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Corrections]] system &amp;ndash; network of governmental agencies that administer a jurisdiction's prisons, probation, and parole systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th Century, William Penn began to promote reform in the Criminal Justice system and helped to see these changes implemented. After the American Revolution, the U.S. Constitution was created which guaranteed freedoms and rights that were never in place in colonial days. This was the starting point to setting guidelines for crimes, punishment and procedures that need to be followed to protect the rights of the innocent.
Our modern system of criminal justice is the result of several evolutionary changes that society has undergone since the inception of the United States. Over the years, Americans have developed mechanisms that institute and enforce the rules of society as well as assign responsibility and punish offenders. Today, those functions are carried out by the police, the courts, and corrections. The early beginnings of the criminal justice system in the United States lacked this structure.

In fact, before formal rules, laws, and institutions were established in the United States, Americans relied on religion and sin as a means of shaping society and its behaviors. Many colonial crime codes were defined in biblical terms, making offenses such as profanity, blasphemy, and sacrileges of the Sabbath highly punishable. Punishments such as dunking, stoning, and whipping were designed to humiliate the offender and ultimately lead towards their repentance. Ironically, we still see this desire to make offenders remorseful for their criminal acts but more so for the victims of crime than to a higher power.

== Crime ==

'''Rare Book Room''' is an [[educational website]] for the repository of digitally scanned rare books made freely available to the public.

Starting around 1996 the California-based company [[Octavo (company)|Octavo]] began scanning rare and important books from libraries around the world. These scans were done at extremely high resolution using high-quality equipment, with some pages at over 200MB each. They were sold by Octavo as commercial products on CD-ROM. In 2006 the "Rare Book Room" website was created which contains the complete collection in medium to medium-high resolution freely available to the public through a web browser or as a PDF file. Some high resolution versions are still being sold by Octavo through a separate website. As of 2007 over 400 books have been scanned.

The repository includes books by [[Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Copernicus]], [[Kepler]], [[Einstein]], and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]. It includes most of the [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)#Quartos|Shakespeare Quartos]] from the [[British Library]], the [[Bodleian Library]], the [[University of Edinburgh]] Library, and the [[National Library of Scotland]], as well as the [[First Folio]] from the [[Folger Library]]. It includes [[Library of Congress]] copies of ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'' by [[Benjamin Franklin]], and other rare editions: a [[Gutenberg Bible]] of 1455, [[William Harvey]]'s [[Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus|book on the circulation of blood]], Galileo ’s ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'', the first printing of the [[United States Bill of Rights]], and the [[Magna Carta]].

The '''Ritual Ladle''' from the 15th-14th centuries BC, was discovered in [[Lchashen]], Armenia with a decorated long handle. It is kept in the [[History Museum of Armenia]] under the number 2007-3.

== Description ==
The ritual ladle is a bronze artifact measuring 52 x 20.5&amp;nbsp;cm. The long handle of the ritual ladle is cylindrical, tubular, and hollow. It is decorated with wedge-shaped cuts ending with a sculptural figure of a bird sitting at the end of the wheel.&lt;ref name="sculpture"&gt;Հայացք բրոնզե դարից, Ալբոմ-կատալոգ, Հայաստանի պատմության թանգարան, 2016, 160 էջ: A Glance from the Bronze Age.

[[File:Western end of the Scots' Dike - geograph.org.uk - 340462.jpg|thumb|290px|The Western terminus of the Scots' Dyke.]]
==Introduction==
The [[Debatable Lands]], also known as "Debatable ground", "Batable ground", or "Threpe" - Scots for something that is argued over&lt;ref name="Warrack"&gt;Warrack, Alexander (1982)."Chambers Scots Dictionary". Chambers. {{ISBN|0-550-11801-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; - were in the West [[Marches]], bounded on the west by the [[River Sark]], to the east by the [[River Esk, Dumfries and Galloway|River Esk]] and [[Liddel Water]], on the north by the Bruntshiell [[Moorland|Moor]] and Tarras [[Bog|Moss]], and on the south by the estuary of the Esk. The area was about ten miles from north to south and three and a half from east to west at its widest part.&lt;ref name="Mack85"&gt;Mack, James Logan (1926). The Border Line. Pub. Oliver &amp; Boyd. P. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canonbie]] was the main population centre within the debatable lands.

These lands were finally divided between the English and Scottish Crowns by an agreement arbitrated by the [[Early Modern France|French]] Ambassador. The physical border constructed came to be known as the "Scots' Dike", the "March Dike" or more recently the 'Scotsdike plantation'. The terminal points of the dike were marked by square stones bearing the royal arms of England and Scotland, however these markers have disappeared, possibly having been broken up for building nearby cottages. Spaced along the centre of the bank are a number of small unmarked boundary stones of uncertain date, some of which have fallen.

==Debatable lands==
===Borderline===

In 1222 a commission of six representatives from each kingdom attempted to fix the border line, and one proposed by the English commissioners more or less equates to that which is shown on [[Ordnance Survey]] maps today.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"&gt;Donaldson, Gordon edit.(1988). ''The Story of Scotland''. Pub. Sunday Mail V.1., Part 6., P. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The western Anglo-Scottish Border was more formally agreed in [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]'s reign with [[David II of Scotland]] in 1330, to run along the course of the [[River Esk, Dumfries and Galloway|Esk]] and [[Liddel Water|Liddel]] from [[Gretna, Dumfries and Galloway|Gretna]] to [[Kershopefoot]] to delineate between the English and Scottish West Marches. In practice, however, this region was controlled by Wardens of the marches who usually held the land in their own right and met at designated sites, such as the [[Lochmaben Stone]] to discuss and settle disputes.
[[Image:Gilnockie Tower April 29 2007.JPG|thumb|Gilnockie Tower lies within the old Debatable land, near [[Canonbie]].]]
[[Image:Debatablelandandscotsdike.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Debatable lands]] and the Scots' Dike]]
In Scotland the [[Clan Maxwell|Maxwells]], [[Clan Johnstone|Johnstons]] and [[Clan Scott|Scotts]] secured the Scottish West March to Gretna and [[Langholm]], and in England the region was controlled from [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]]. The Esk basin at [[Arthuret]] was a marshy bogland which was difficult to police, with the Scottish jurisdiction having difficulty policing their side from Gretna to [[Canonbie]]. The Debatable Land arose because the [[Clan Graham|Grahams]], [[Clan Armstrong|Armstrongs]], [[Clan Elliot|Elliots]] and Bells were too powerful, and the Wardens largely left them alone. These four families raided equally in both England and Scotland, claiming allegiance to neither country; it actually suited both Governments to have such a "buffer" zone, so the district became a sort of no-mans land, where neither country could or would enforce their jurisdiction.

Eventually the general lawlessness spilled over and both Wardens demanded that the Debatable Land be eradicated. So in 1552 the French ambassador was appointed to finalise the Border line, together with [[Thomas Wharton, 1st Baron Wharton|Lord Wharton]] (of the [[Battle of Solway Moss]] fame) and [[Thomas Chaloner (statesman)|Sir Thomas Chaloner]] nominated and appointed from England; [[James Douglas, 3rd Earl of Morton|Sir James Douglas]] of [[Drumlanrig Castle|Drumlanrig]] and [[Richard Maitland]] of [[Lennoxlove House|Lethington]] likewise nominated and appointed from Scotland. The Commissioners agreed to a compromise demarcation line suggested by the French Ambassador, and issued a final declaration that the borderline would run from the [[River Sark|Sark]] to a point on Esk, ''opposite the house of Fergus Greme; a cross pattee at each end and styled 'this is the least and fynal lyne of the particion concluded xxiiij Septembris 1552.' ''&lt;ref name="Mack89"&gt;Mack, James Logan (1926). The Border Line. Pub. Oliver &amp; Boyd. P. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ridpath in 1776 records that "''..after some scruples and delays, commissioners appointed by each of the powers , met on the spot, and agreed on a line to be marked by a ditch and march stones.''"&lt;ref&gt;Ridpath, George (1776). The Border History of England and Scotland Deduced from the Earliest Times to the Union of the Two Crowns. London : T. Cadell, Edinburgh : J. Balfour. P.573.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Division of the Debatable Lands==
The Debatable Land was physically divided into two halves by a man-made ditch called the 'Scots' Dike', giving the western half (Grahams and Bells) to England under [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] and the eastern half (Armstrongs and Elliots) to Scotland under [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Queen Mary]]. England received the main western road into Scotland, while Scotland received little else but moorland; however, the Scots portion was the larger when the dike came to be built.&lt;ref name="Mack90"&gt;Mack, James Logan (1926). The Border Line. Pub. Oliver &amp; Boyd. P. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===

The method adopted to dig the Scots' Dike was to dig two parallel ditches, and throw the material excavated therefrom into the intervening space, thus forming an earthen mound of varying height. There is no evidence of stone having been used. East of Crawsknow farm, the Dike appears originally to have been about 12 feet broad and 3 or 4 feet high, however it is variable e.g. at one point the Dike takes the form of a narrow strip and then becomes a double ditch with a space of about 30 ft separating them. There is little evidence that the dike has ever been used as a footpath. It may be that two teams built the dike, possibly one from each kingdom, with one starting from the west and another from the east. When the teams came close enough to each other they seem to have been about 21 feet out of their bearings and a correction in the line of the Dike became necessary.&lt;ref name="Mack94"&gt;Mack, James Logan (1926). The Border Line. Pub. Oliver &amp; Boyd. P. 94 - 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminal stones===

[[Image:Cross-Pattee-Heraldry.svg|thumb|right|A Cross pattee]]
[[Image:Cross-Pattee-Alisee.svg|thumb|left|A Cross pattee]]
The various sources state that the terminal stones were square stones bearing the royal arms of England and Scotland,&lt;ref name="Mack89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RCAHMS"&gt;[http://www.rcahms.gov.uk/pls/portal/newcanmore.newcandig_details_gis?inumlink=67548 Information on 'Canmore' relating to the Scots dike]&lt;/ref&gt; however the Commissioners stated that ''.....a cross pattee at each end and styled 'this is the least and fynal lyne of the particion concluded xxiiij Septembris 1552.' ''&lt;ref name="Mack89"/&gt; A [[cross pattée]] is a type of [[cross]] that has arms which are narrow at the centre, and broader at the perimeter. The name comes from the fact that the shape of each arm of the cross was thought to resemble a paw (French ''patte''). There are several variants of the cross pattée, however it is not known whether these were ever actually made for installation at the dike's terminal points. What fate befell the stones that were made is not recorded. The 19th-century OS maps mark a number of boundary stones which are very unlikely to be contemporary with the terminal stones.

===Name of the dike===

[[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]]'s ''Scotiae Regnum'' of 1595 shows the Scots' Dike but does not name it.&lt;ref name="Mercator"&gt;[http://www.nls.uk/maps/early/scotland.cfm?id=131 Mercator's map of Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt;
Robert Gordon's manuscript map of 1636-52 clearly marks the dike but does not name it or indicate any farms etc associated with it.&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;[http://www.nls.uk/maps/early/counties.cfm?id=51 Robert Gordon's map]&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''[[Blaeu Atlas of Scotland]]'' by [[Joan Blaeu]] (1654) refers to the Dike as the 'March (dyik) Dike' and indicates a dwelling named 'March-dike (dyik)-foot'.&lt;ref name="Blaeu"&gt;[http://www.nls.uk/maps/early/blaeu/78.html Blaeu's Map and the March Dike.]&lt;/ref&gt; Herman Moll's (died 1732) map gives the name 'March Dyck', however he oddly does not show the 'March Dike' as being the borderline.&lt;ref name="Moll"&gt;[http://www.nls.uk/maps/early/counties.cfm?id=216 Moll's map.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[William Roy|General Roy]]'s ''Military Survey of Scotland'', undertaken from 1747-1752, clearly marks the 'Scots Dyke' by that name for the first time, shown as a set of parallel lines running from the Sark to the Esk.&lt;ref name="Roy"&gt;[http://geo.nls.uk/roy/ General Roy's Military Survey of Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name 'Scots' Dike' was in use by Roy's time, that is the mid 18th-century, but previously 'March Dike' seems to have been favoured. It is not clear why the name 'Scots' stuck, as the Scots might just as well have called it the 'English Dyke'; there has been an 'Englishtown farm' marked since at least Roy's time.

===Place-names associated with the dike===

|'''Etymology'''
|- style="text-align:left; font-size:x-medium;"
|A '''Roan''' in Scots is a tangle of brushwood or thorns and a 'Rig' is a section of a ploughed field. '''Roamyrigg''' seems a particularly accurate description of this site. '&lt;ref name="Warrack"/&gt;
|}
The Blaeu Atlas of Scotland (1654) is the first to indicates a named dwelling, this being 'March-dike (dyik)-foot'.&lt;ref name="Blaeu"/&gt; General Roy's ''Military Survey of Scotland'' undertaken from 1747{{spaced ndash}}1752, indicates both 'Craws Know', 'English town' and 'Scots Dyke', however March-dike-foot is not shown by that name.&lt;ref name="Roy"/&gt;

[[William Crawford (surveyor)|William Crawford]]'s map of 1804 shows a dwelling called Scots dyke and another called Crossdyke&lt;ref name="Crawford"&gt;[http://www.nls.uk/maps/early/597.html William Crawford's map]&lt;/ref&gt; which is no longer marked as such by the 1920s. [[Thomas Moule]]'s map of 1830 shows a 'Dykestown' which is also shown in Roy's map.&lt;ref name="Moule"&gt;The County maps of old England. Thomas Moule. 1990. Pub. Stdio Editions. {{ISBN|1-85170-403-5}}. P. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1901 OS marks a dwelling named 'Roamyrigg' at the Sark end of the dike, lying within part of what had been woodland with a boundary marker nearby (now fallen). This dwelling is not shown on the 1952 OS or at any later date.

==Scots Dike in the 20th century==
===Location===

The Dike runs from NY 3307 7367 to NY 3872 7319 ([[British national grid reference system]]) between the rivers [[River Sark|Sark]] and [[River Esk, Dumfries and Galloway|Esk]] and forms the border between England and Scotland for that length.
===Damage===

It is clear from OS maps that since at least 1862 the majority of the length of the Scots' Dike has been [[afforestation|afforested]]. Prior to the [[World War I|First World War]] (1914{{spaced ndash}}1918) the section within the Scotsdike Plantation was largely intact, however tree felling operations, such as the laying down of temporary railway lines on top of the Dike and the hauling of cut tree trunks, caused considerable damage or even complete destruction in places. The period between 1916 and 1926 seems to have been the worst, despite complaints having been lodged regarding the wholesale destruction of a national monument.&lt;ref name="Mack97"&gt;Mack, James Logan (1926). The Border Line. Pub. Oliver &amp; Boyd. P. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual remains===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Scotsdikecentre.jpg|thumb|left|170px|&lt;center&gt;The central portion of the Scots' Dike which was destroyed before 1924&lt;center&gt;]] --&gt;
The dike is only traceable within the Scots Dike Plantation, consisting of a bank, with slight ditches on either side, which varies in width from 5.8 m at the west end to 3.3 m at the east end, standing to a maximum height of 0.8 m.&lt;ref name="Barber"&gt;Barber, John (1999).''The Linear Earthworks of Southern Scotland; survey and classification''. Trans. Dumfriesshire &amp; Galloway Nat. Hist. Soc. LXXIII. ISSN 0141-1292. P. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The E and W ends cannot be traced, and in places the ditches have silted up while elsewhere they have been re-cut. 

In June 1999 English Heritage field investigators visited as part of a National survey pilot project. They describe the monument as lying at the centre of a belt of woodland, comprising spruce plantation to the north of the dike and deciduous woodland to its south. Parts of the plantation had been felled recently, but the dense vegetation rendered detailed survey impossible and investigation was limited to surface examination of the dike. The remains of the linear earthwork, between NY 3346 7396 and NY 3850 7325, consisted mainly of flat-topped bank flanked by a ditch on either side. The form and preservation of these features varied considerably along the length of the dike and it was concluded that little of the monument survived in its original form, however its course is preserved in later boundaries and drainage ditches.&lt;ref name="RCAHMS"/&gt;

{|style="float:right; margin:1em 1em 1em 1em; width:27em; border: 1px solid #a0a0a0; padding: 10px; background-color: #F5F5F5; text-align:left;"

|'''Etymology'''
|- style="text-align:left; font-size:x-medium;"
|A '''Craw''' in Scots is a rook, carrion or hooded crow. A 'Knowe' is a knoll or low hill. '''Crawknowe''' is therefore the 'Hill of the Crow.'&lt;ref name="Warrack"/&gt;
|}

Long sections of the ditches, especially the northern ditch, have been re-cut to provide drainage for the conifer plantation, although in places the modern drainage appears to have been cut through the centre of the dike. Elsewhere, for example at NY 3490 7385, the feature have been almost plough-levelled, the ditches having disappeared and the bank surviving as little more than a rise in the ground. Between NY 3544 7375 and NY 3570 7370, where the [[Glenzier]] Beck crosses the course of the dike, there are no traces of the earthwork; whether it has simply not survived or whether the dyke was ever constructed across the slack was not apparent. At a number of points along the length of the dike - most notably at approximately NY 34457390 and NY 36357355 - there is a disjointure in the earthwork which is suggestive of a shift in the line of the original boundary, perhaps due to later land use. At the extreme western end of the dike, between approximately NY 3346 7396 and NY 3390 7392, a second, much slighter bank and ditch lies to the south of the main earthwork but may be nothing more than later drainage. The course of the dike between the western end of Scotsdike Plantation and the River Sark could not be traced on the ground but it was thought that it followed the extant field boundary to the south of Craw's Knowe farm.&lt;ref name="RCAHMS"/&gt;

===Access===

The site is marked as an ancient monument on some tourist maps&lt;ref name="Philip's"&gt;Philip's big driver's atlas of Britain. 2007. Octopus Publishing. P. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; and 'Solway Heritage' unveiled a new access point to the dike in 1999.&lt;ref name="Solway"&gt;''Dike becomes the Border again.'' Sunday Herald (Glasgow) (11 April 1999 P. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; No interpretation or formal access to the dike itself exists at present (2006). The easiest point of informal access is via the minor road at the Sark end of the dike.

Access from the eastern end is from a large lay-by on the A7.  A path runs round the back of a house (at 387733) and up the bank to the rear.  On entering the wood there is a bridge across a ditch with a modern marker post showing the location of the boundary.

===Status===

The Scot's Dike is recorded in the English National Archaeological Record as ancient monument NY37SE 14, and in Scotland it is likewise recorded by the RCAHMS as NMRS number: NY37SE 6. It is a scheduled monument under the terms of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979; from the crest north the monument is scheduled in Scotland; from the crest south, in England. 

==Scotch Dike railway station==
A railway station named [[Scotch Dyke railway station|Scotch Dyke]] was opened on 25 October 1861 by the [[Border Union Railway]] as 'Scotsdyke' and later renamed 'Scotch Dyke'. It was on the English side of the [[Anglo-Scottish border|present border]], and closed on 2 May 1949. It was a two-platform station with a level crossing to its north. Today (2006) the former station retains its building and platforms. The canopy of the building has a script reading "Speed and comfort by rail" with its 'British Railways' logo.&lt;ref name="Borders"&gt;[http://www.railscot.co.uk/Border_Union_Railway/body.htm Scotch Dyke station]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other National Border earthworks==
The '''''Countrup Sike'''''&lt;ref name="Sike"&gt;[[Wikibooks:A Researcher's Guide to Local History Terminology|A Researcher's Guide to Local History terminology]]&lt;/ref&gt; at NT 8495 2912 is a much reduced bank, 0.2 m high and 2 m wide, running for less than 20 m, virtually along the line of the Border in a north-west direction. Its true nature remains to be confirmed as this will require more than just field observation.&lt;ref name="Barber"&gt;Barber, John (1999).''The Linear Earthworks of Southern Scotland; survey and classification''. Trans. Dumfriesshaire &amp; Galloway Nat. Hist. Soc. LXXIII. ISSN 0141-1292. P. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scots Dike at Richmond==
A Scots Dike also exists at [[Richmond, North Yorkshire]], where it runs up to the river [[River Swale|Swale]]. It is of unknown date, and consists of a linear ditch and a bank, showing some of the characteristics of an Anglo-Saxon territorial boundary.&lt;ref name="Scots"&gt;[http://www.richmond.org.uk/pdf/svi_pdf/rep/p1.pdf Scots Dike at Richmond]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellany==
The term 'lands Debatable' was still being used as late as 1604 by the [[College of Justice|Supreme Courts of Justice]] in Scotland.&lt;ref name="Mack91"&gt;Mack, James Logan (1926). The Border Line. Pub. Oliver &amp; Boyd. P. 91, page note 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Scotland a dyke or ''dike'' is a stone wall, but in England a ''dyke'' is a ditch.&lt;ref name="Mack94"/&gt; In the Cumbrian dialect of English a Dike is the name given to a banked hedgerow.

The [[Battle of Solway Moss]] took place in the Debatable land near [[Gretna, Dumfries and Galloway|Gretna]] on 24 November 1542. It was described as a rout in which the Scots lost and shortly after [[James V of Scotland]] died, although he had not been present at the battle in person.

The '''Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America''' ('''SPP''') was a region-level dialogue with the stated purpose of providing greater cooperation on security and economic issues.&lt;ref name="TACiht"/&gt; The Partnership was founded in [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], [[Texas]], on March 23, 2005, by Prime Minister of [[Canada]] [[Paul Martin]], President of [[Mexico]] [[Vicente Fox]], and U.S. President [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref name="TACiht"&gt;{{Cite news| last      = Bennett| first = Drake | title = The amero conspiracy| newspaper = [[International Herald Tribune]]| date=       2007-11-25| url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/11/25/america/25Amero.php| postscript      = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the second of such regional-level agreements involving the United States following the 1997 [[Partnership for Prosperity and Security in the Caribbean]] (PPS).

Since August 2009 it is no longer an active initiative of any of the original dialogue partners. It has been largely superseded by the annual [[North American Leaders' Summit]], an event that was established as part of SPP.

== Organization ==

The initial SPP Working Groups were the Manufactured Goods and Sectoral and Regional Competitiveness Working Group, E-Commerce &amp; ICT Working Group, Energy Working Group, Transportation Working Group, Food &amp; Agriculture Working Group, Environment Working Group, Financial Services Working Group, Business Facilitation Working Group, Movement of Goods Working Group, Health, and Immigration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spp.gov/prosperity_working/index.asp?dName=prosperity_working SPP: Prosperity Working Groups] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219155418/http://www.spp.gov/prosperity_working/index.asp?dName=prosperity_working |date=2007-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These working groups were tasked with implementing the SPP as initiated by the North American Heads of Government and 30 CEOs of the largest corporations from each respective country on March 23, 2005.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} They were to consult with stakeholders; set specific, measurable, and achievable goals and implementation dates; and issue semiannual progress reports. A 24-month agenda was established to serve as a time line milestone to have the initial framework fully developed.

== Goals ==

The stated goals of the SPP were cooperation and information sharing, improving productivity, reducing the costs of trade, enhancing the joint stewardship of the environment, facilitating agricultural trade while creating a safer and more reliable food supply, and protecting people from disease.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

North American Facilitation of Transportation, Trade, Reduced Congestion &amp; Security (NAFTRACS) was a three-phase pilot project designed to focus on business processes and information as freight is transported from buyers to sellers. The project was intended to create a partnership between businesses and local, state, and federal governments while claiming to foster cooperation among the same entities.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

== Announced funding ==

On 26 February 2008, Canada's Minister of Finance [[Jim Flaherty]], announced his government's [[2008 Canadian federal budget|2008 budget]], which included "$29 million over two years to meet priorities under the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America".&lt;ref&gt;

== North American Competitiveness Council ==

The [[North American Competitiveness Council]] (NACC) was an official tri-national working group of the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (SPP). It was created at the second summit of the SPP in Cancún, Quintana Roo, Mexico, in March 2006. Composed of 30 corporate representatives from some of North America's largest companies, the North American Competitiveness Council has been mandated to set priorities for the SPP and to act as a stable driver of the integration process through changes in government in all three countries.

== Trilateral summit meetings ==
{{Main|North American Leaders' Summit}}
[[Image:SPP2006.jpg|thumb=SPP2006.jpg|The 2006 meeting of the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America.]]
As part of SPP, an annual trilateral summit was held between the leaders of the three countries. Following the cancellation of the SPP initiative in 2009, the summits continued as the [[North American Leaders' Summit]].

* '''August 9–10, 2009''' - [[Guadalajara]], [[Jalisco]], [[Mexico]]

==Criticism==
In 2006, [[CNN]] anchor [[Lou Dobbs]] argued that the SPP was part of a plan to merge the United States, Canada, and Mexico into a [[North American Union]] similar to the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0606/21/ldt.01.html|title=North American Union?|publisher=CNN|date=2006-06-21|accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Dobbs claimed that U.S. President Bush, who left office on January 20, 2009, was to have bypassed Congress and ultimately create a Union based on a [[Trans-Texas Corridor|Texas highway corridor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.corridorwatch.org/ttc_2007/CW00000092.htm|title=CorridorWatch.org - Challenging the Wisdom of the Trans-Texas Corridor|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117153654/http://www.corridorwatch.org/ttc_2007/CW00000092.htm|archivedate=2010-01-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council of Canadians]] claimed that the SPP extended the controversial "[[no fly list]]" of the United States, made Canadian water a communal resource, and forced Canada and Mexico to adopt the United States' security policies—one of which would allow foreign military forces to neglect sovereignty in the case of a "civil emergency". In addition, it also touched on the issue of [[Athabasca Oil Sands|Albertan tar sands]] expansion to five times its current size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://canadians.org/integratethis/backgrounders/guide/index.html Behind Closed Doors: What they're not telling us about the Security and Prosperity Partnership] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101105434/http://canadians.org/integratethis/backgrounders/guide/index.html |date=2011-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 10, 2007, Conservative MP [[Leon Benoit]], chair of the [[Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on International Trade]], prevented [[University of Alberta]] professor Gordon Laxer from testifying that SPP would leave Canadians "to freeze in the dark" because "Canada itself—unlike most industrialized nations—has no national plan or reserves to protect its own supplies" by saying Laxer's testimony was irrelevant, defying a majority vote to overrule his motion, shutting down the Committee meeting, and leaving with the other three out of four Conservative members; the meeting  later continued presided by the Liberal vice-chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kelly|last=Patterson|title=Tory chair storms out of SPP hearing|date=2007-05-11|publisher=|url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=c6291848-5f41-4b72-831a-2e889cd6bb9e|work=The Ottawa Citizen|pages=|accessdate=2007-08-03|language=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716230450/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=c6291848-5f41-4b72-831a-2e889cd6bb9e|archivedate=2007-07-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After these disruptions, the ''[[National Post]]'' reported on a Conservative party manual to, among other things, usurp Parliamentary committees and cause chaos in unfavourable committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Don|last=Martin|title=Tories have the book on political wrangling|date=2007-05-18|publisher=|url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=a1c7c666-90bc-419d-a71a-808c0bd10934&amp;k=28319&amp;p=1|work=National Post|pages=|accessdate=2007-08-03|language=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014014705/http://canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=a1c7c666-90bc-419d-a71a-808c0bd10934&amp;k=28319&amp;p=1|archivedate=2007-10-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Tories blasted for handbook on paralyzing Parliament|date=2007-05-18|publisher=CTV|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070518/tories_parliament_070518/20070518/|work=Canadian Press|pages=|accessdate=2007-08-03|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] also criticized SPP for being undemocratic, not open to Parliament, and opaque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=US Congress demands transparency in SPP agenda - Canadians also deserve to know what Americans will know about continental integration plan: NDP MP Peter Julian|date=2007-07-26|publisher=NDP|url=https://www.ndp.ca/page/5550|work=|pages=|accessdate=2007-08-03|language= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070816142423/http://www.ndp.ca/page/5550 |archivedate = 2007-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] leader [[Jack Layton]] described the process as not simply unconstitutional, but "non-constitutional", held completely outside the usual mechanisms of oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sara Falconer|title=Popping the lid off the SPP|date=2007-08-16|publisher=Hour Magazine|url=http://www.hour.ca/news/news.aspx?iIDArticle=12692|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908044635/http://www.hour.ca/news/news.aspx?iIDArticle=12692|archivedate=2007-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately thirty U.S.-based organizations also sent an open letter to Congress on April 21, 2008, criticizing the secrecy and lack of any sort of democratic oversight:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"What differentiates the SPP from other security and trade agreements is that it is not subject to Congressional oversight or approval. The SPP establishes a corporate/government bureaucracy for implementation that excludes civil society participation. ... Facing a worrisome pact pushed forward in secrecy, it is time for Congress to halt this undemocratic approach and establish a process based on openness, accountability, and the participation of civil society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsausa.org/NewsFromDSA/20apr2008.htm Open letter to the U.S. Congress, April 21, 2008.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101164500/http://www.dsausa.org/NewsFromDSA/20apr2008.htm |date=January 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Cancellation==

In August 2009, the SPP website was updated to say: "The Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (SPP) is no longer an active initiative. There will not be any updates to this site".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rabble.ca/news/2009/09/spp-dead-lets-keep-it-way|title=The SPP is dead.

The NDP has called this a "victory" which is "the result of the active and sustained efforts across the country, and across North America, of Canadian, Mexican, and American activists from the labour movement, civil society, progressive legislators and all those concerned and committed to build a better quality of life in our Canada and throughout North America".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndp.ca/press/new-democrats-celebrates-victory-over-spp|title=Canada's NDP|newspaper=Canada's NDP|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805232029/http://www.ndp.ca/press/new-democrats-celebrates-victory-over-spp|archive-date=2012-08-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewed discussions==
On February 4, 2011, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and U.S. President Barack Obama announced a new security and prosperity initiative with plans to "pursue a perimeter approach to security in ways that support economic competitiveness, job creation, and prosperity".&lt;ref name="Httpwwwborderactionplanplandactionfrontaliergccapsecscepdeclarationdeclarationaspxlangeng"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://actionplan.gc.ca/en/page/bbg-tpf/border-action-plan|title=Budget 2016|last=Government of Canada, Department of Finance|first=|date=|website=actionplan.gc.ca|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13, 2011, the Canadian government announced it was beginning a five-week consultation process "with all levels of government and with communities, non-governmental organizations and the private sector, as well as with our citizens on the implementation of the shared vision for perimeter security and economic competitiveness".&lt;ref name="Httpwwwinternationalgccamediaaffnewscommuniquesaspx"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/media/aff/news-communiques/2011/099.aspx?lang=eng|title=International Trade Minister Van Loan and Minister of State Lebel Launch Public Consultation on Shared Vision for Canada-U.S. Perimeter Security and Economic Competitiveness|website=GAC|access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2624">'''Serial imagery''' is the repeating of one image in many variations or forms. It is a central idea in modern and contemporary art. It can take several forms. A portrait can painted in differing hues and backgrounds with subtle changes to the subject as in Van Gogh's L'Arlésienne and Claude Monet’s [[Rouen Cathedral (Monet)|Rouen Cathedral]] Another type is where the same subject is painted at different times of day or seasons of the year for example [[Claude Monet]] in his [[Poplar Series (Monet)|Poplars]], [[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]].  The same subject may also be rendered in different mediums, and in different poses, thus, the practice of underpainting may be considered a form of serial imagery even if the image is lost in the completed work. It is common in photography where multiple exposures at varies angles are taken with different lenses etc. in search of the desired effect. It is also used in literature, especially poetry.

	Some say the [[Impressionists]] and their contemporaries were the first to use it, but this is not the case. It was used by [[Francisco Goya]] with his La maja desnuda and La maja vestida (1797-1800).  It is seen in classical art whenever studies were made and used to produce a finished work. This was a common practice for [[Leonardo da Vinci]]', Michelangelo and most of the other classical artists although most of their studies and sketches did not survive.

	Here is an example from literature.


    What Say You? 
   (By Eric Ericson)
 
 What say you faithful tree?
 In summer’s glory standing tall 
 while autumn’s minions sneak 
 to steal your green,
 so you go necked into winter.
 
 What say you faithful tree? 
 In golden robes resplendent, 
 your arm’s reach skyward 
 showing off your finery,
 knowing this to shall pass. 
 
 What say you faithful tree
 standing necked in the snow?
 I would pity you,
 as winter’s icy breath bites
 your fingers and tears your flesh,
 but you don’t want me to.
 
 What say you faithful tree?
 As the sun turns warm
 all clad in white blossoms
 with velvet leaves
 just beginning to show.
 What say you?

{{Patent law}}

Legal scholars, economists, activists, policymakers, industries, and trade organizations have held differing views on patents and engaged in contentious debates on the subject. Critical perspectives emerged in the nineteenth century that were especially based on the principles of [[free trade]].&lt;ref name=Johns&gt;Johns, Adrian: ''Piracy.

The University of Chicago Press, 2009, {{ISBN|9780226401188}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|262–263}}  Contemporary criticisms have echoed those arguments, claiming that patents block innovation and waste resources that could otherwise be used productively,&lt;ref name='boldrin'&gt;{{Cite book| last = Levine | first = David | authorlink = David K.

Project Syndicate, 2007. [http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/stiglitz81/English project-syndicate.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

These debates are part of a larger discourse on [[societal views on intellectual property|intellectual property protection]] which also reflects differing perspectives on [[anti-copyright|copyright]].

==History==
Criticism of patents reached an early peak in Victorian Britain between 1850 and 1880, in a campaign against patenting that expanded to target [[copyright]] too and, in the judgment of historian Adrian Johns, "remains to this day the strongest [campaign] ever undertaken against intellectual property", coming close to abolishing patents.&lt;ref name=Johns/&gt;{{rp|247}} Its most prominent activists - [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], [[William Robert Grove]], [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]] and [[Robert Andrew Macfie|Robert A. MacFie]] - were inventors and entrepreneurs, and it was also supported by radical [[laissez-faire]] economists ([[The Economist]] published anti-patent views), law scholars, scientists (who were concerned that patents were obstructing research) and manufacturers.&lt;ref name=Johns/&gt;{{rp|249, 267, 270}}  Johns summarizes some of their main arguments as follows:&lt;ref name=Johns/&gt;{{rp|273}}&lt;ref&gt;W.R. Grove: ''Suggestions for Improvements in the Administration of the Patent Law'', [[The Jurist]] n.s. 6 (January 28, 1860) 19-25 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=BWlMAAAAYAAJ online copy] at Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Sherman, L. Bently: ''The Making of Modern Intellectual Property Law'' (CUP 1999), 50-56 {{ISBN|9780521057134}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''[Patents] projected an artificial idol of the single inventor, radically denigrated the role of the intellectual commons, and blocked a path to this commons for other citizens — citizens who were all, on this account, potential inventors too. [...] Patentees were the equivalent of squatters on public land — or better, of uncouth market traders who planted their barrows in the middle of the highway and barred the way of the people.''
Similar debates took place during that time in other European countries such as France, [[Prussia]], Switzerland and the Netherlands (but not in the USA).&lt;ref name=Johns/&gt;{{rp|248}}

Based on the criticism of patents as state-granted monopolies inconsistent with [[free trade]], the [[Netherlands]] abolished patents in 1869 (having established them in 1817), and did not reintroduce them until 1912.&lt;ref name="kick"&gt;[[Ha Joon Chang|Chang, Ha-Joon]]. [http://www.paecon.net/PAEtexts/Chang1.htm "Kicking Away the Ladder: How the Economic and Intellectual Histories of Capitalism Have Been Re-Written to Justify Neo-Liberal Capitalism"]. ''[[Post-Autistic Economics Review]]''. 4 September 2002: Issue 15, Article 3. Retrieved on 8 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In Switzerland, criticism of patents delayed the introduction of patent laws until 1907.&lt;ref name=Johns/&gt;{{rp|248}}&lt;ref name="kick"/&gt;

==Contemporary arguments==
Contemporary arguments have focused on ways that patents can slow innovation by: blocking researchers' and companies' access to basic, enabling technology, and particularly following the explosion of patent filings in the 1990s, through the creation of "patent thickets"; wasting productive time and resources fending off enforcement of low-quality patents that should not have existed, particularly by "patent trolls"; and wasting money on patent litigation.  Patents on pharmaceuticals have been a particular focus of criticism, as the high prices they enable puts life-saving drugs out of reach of many people.

===Blocking innovation===
The most general argument against patents is that "intellectual property" in all its forms represents an effort to claim something that should not be owned, and harms society by slowing innovation and wasting resources.&lt;ref name='boldrin'/&gt;

Law professors [[Michael Heller (law professor)|Michael Heller]] and Rebecca Sue Eisenberg have described an ongoing [[tragedy of the anticommons]] with regard to the proliferation of patents in the field of [[biotechnology]], wherein  intellectual property rights have become so fragmented that, effectively, no one can take advantage of them as to do so would require an agreement between the owners of all of the fragments.&lt;ref name=anticommons/&gt;

Some public campaigns for improving access to medicines and [[genetically modified food]] have expressed a concern for "preventing the over-reach" of intellectual property protection including patent protection, and "to retain a public balance in property rights".&lt;ref name=sksell&gt;Susan K Sell (2003), ''Private Power, Public Law: The Globalization of Intellectual Property Rights'', Cambridge, 2003 Cambridge University Press: [http://www.international-ul.com/pdf/ebook/1/_Uyz13PfFMbDE.pdf Cambridge Studies in International Relations: 88]; quoted from page 179, see also page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QjSOfWPo6V4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=genetically&amp;f=false | title = Intellectual Property Rights and the Life Science Industries: A Twentieth Century History | isbn = 9780754621119 | author1 = Dutfield | first1 = Graham | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some economists&lt;ref name='boldrin'/&gt; and scientists&lt;ref name="Pearce J.

Others claim that patents have had no effect on research, based on surveys of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook |first=Robert |url=http://www.thehastingscenter.org/Publications/BriefingBook/Detail.aspx?id=2174 |title=Gene Patents |publisher=The Hastings Center |date= |accessdate=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scienceprogress.org/2009/10/do-gene-patents-hurt-research/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404034653/http://www.scienceprogress.org/2009/10/do-gene-patents-hurt-research/ |archivedate=2011-04-04 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Poor patent quality and patent trolls===
Patents have also been criticized for being granted on already-known inventions, with some complaining in the United States that the USPTO fails "to do a serious job of examining patents, thus allowing bad patents to slip through the system."&lt;ref name="lemley"&gt;Lemley, Mark A., Rational Ignorance at the Patent Office (February 2001). Northwestern University Law Review, Vol. 95, No. 4, 2001. {{doi|10.2139/ssrn.261400}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some argue that because of low number of patents going into litigation, increasing quality of patents at [[patent prosecution]] stage increases overall legal costs associated with patents, and that current USPTO policy is a reasonable compromise between full trial on examination stage on one hand, and pure registration without examination, on the other hand.&lt;ref name="lemley"/&gt;

Enforcement of patents – especially patents perceived as being overly broad – by [[patent trolls]], has brought criticism of the patent system,&lt;ref name=Barker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |last1=Blumberg |first1=Alex |last2=Sydell |first2=Laura |url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/496/when-patents-attack-part-two |title=When Patents Attack... Part Two! |website=This American Life |publisher=Chicago Public Media |date=May 31, 2013 |accessdate=June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some commentators suggest that patent trolls are not bad for the patent system at all but instead realign market participant incentives, make patents more liquid, and clear the patent market.&lt;ref&gt;James F.

Some patents granted in Russia have been denounced as [[pseudoscientific]] (for example, health-related patents using lunar phase or religious icons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Litigation costs===
According to [[James Bessen]], the costs of patent litigation exceed their investment value in all industries except chemistry and pharmaceuticals. For example, in the software industry, litigation costs are twice the investment value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bessen James | year = 2008 | title = The value of U.S. patents by owner and patent characteristics | url = | journal = Research Policy | volume = 37 | issue = 5| pages = 932–945 | doi=10.1016/j.respol.2008.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bessen and Meurer also note that software and business model litigation accounts for a disproportionate share (almost 40 percent) of patent litigation cost, and the poor performance of the patent system negatively affects these industries.&lt;ref name=BessenMeurer/&gt;&lt;ref name=WheelerAllworth&gt;Rob Wheeler and James Allworth for the Harvard Business Review.  Sept 15, 2011 [https://hbr.org/2011/09/the-america-invents-act-rearra U.S. Patent Overhaul Won’t Help Innovators]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Different industries but one law===
[[Richard Posner]] noted that the most controversial feature of US patent law is that it covers all industries in the same way, but not all industries benefit from the time-limited monopoly a patent provides in order to spur innovation.&lt;ref name=Posner/&gt;  He said that while the pharmaceutical industry is "poster child" for the need for a twenty-year monopoly, since costs to bring to a market are high, the time of development is often long, and the risks are high, in other industries like software the cost and risk of innovation is much lower and the cycle of innovation is quicker, and obtaining and enforcing patents and defending against patent litigation is generally a waste of resources in those industries.&lt;ref name=Posner/&gt;

===Pharmaceutical patents===
Some have raised ethical objections specifically with respect to pharmaceutical patents and the high prices for medication that they enable their proprietors to charge, which poor people in the developed world, and developing world, cannot afford.&lt;ref name="Banta, D.H. 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferreira L. (2002) [http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3874&amp;context=flr&amp;sei-redir=1&amp; Access to Affordable HIV/AIDS Drugs: The Human Rights Obligations of Multinational Pharmaceutical Corporations] Fordham Law Review 71(3):1133–79&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also question the rationale that exclusive patent rights and the resulting high prices are required for pharmaceutical companies to recoup the large investments needed for research and development.&lt;ref name="Banta, D.H. 2001"/&gt; One study concluded that marketing expenditures for new drugs often doubled the amount that was allocated for research and development.&lt;ref&gt;Barton J.H. and Emanuel, E.J. (2005) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16249422 The Patents-Based Pharmaceutical Development Process: Rationale, Problems and Potential Reforms] Journal of the American Medical Association 294(16): 2075–82&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) reached an agreement, which provides a developing country with options for obtaining needed medications under [[compulsory licensing]] or importation of cheaper versions of the drugs, even before patent expiration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres03_e/pr350_e.htm Decision removes final patent obstacle to cheap drug imports]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the government of Brazil declared [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]]'s [[efavirenz]] anti-retroviral drug a "public interest" medicine, and challenged Merck to negotiate lower prices with the government or have Brazil strip the patent by issuing a compulsory license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.newsrx.com/newsletters/Health-and-Medicine-Week/2004-08-02/080220043339965W.html | title = Drugs give HIV patients longer lives in victory for anti-patent activists| publisher =Health &amp; Medicine Week | date = August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5027532.stm | last = Anderson | first = Tatum | title = Africa rises to HIV drug challenge| publisher =BBC News |date=June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gay&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2007/05/03/6
| title = Brazil’s HIV-drug break down| publisher =gay.com |date=May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is reported that [[Ghana]], [[Tanzania]], the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] and [[Ethiopia]] have similar plans to produce generic antiviral drugs. [[Western world|Western]] pharmaceutical companies initially responded with legal challenges, but some have now promised to introduce alternative pricing structures for developing countries and NGOs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gay /&gt;

In July 2008 Nobel Prize-winning scientist Sir [[John Sulston]] called for an international biomedical treaty to clear up issues over patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7490384.stm | last = McGrath  | first = Matt  | title = Sulston argues for openmedicine| publisher =BBC News |date=July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these criticisms, one review concluded that less than 5 percent of medicines on the [[essential drugs|World Health Organization's list of essential drugs]] are under patent.&lt;ref name="PoIP"&gt;Ghafele R (2008) [http://www.ip-institute.org.uk/pdfs/Perceptions%20of%20IP.pdf Perceptions of Intellectual Property: A Review] London: Intellectual Property Institute&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the pharmaceutical industry has contributed US$2 billion for healthcare in developing countries, providing HIV/AIDS drugs at lower cost or even free of charge in certain countries, and has used differential pricing and parallel imports to provide medication to the poor.&lt;ref name="PoIP" /&gt; Other groups are investigating how social inclusion and equitable distribution of research and development findings can be obtained within the existing intellectual property framework, although these efforts have received less exposure.&lt;ref name="PoIP" /&gt;

Quoting a [[World Health Organization]] report, Trevor Jones (director of research and development at the Wellcome Foundation, as of 2006) argued in 2006 that patent monopolies do not create [[monopoly pricing]]. He argued that the companies given monopolies "set prices largely on the willingness/ability to pay, also taking into account the country, disease and regulation" instead of receiving competition from legalized generics.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

==Proposed alternatives to the patent system==
Alternatives have been discussed to address the issue of financial incentivization to replace patents. Mostly, they are related to some form of direct or indirect government funding. One example is [[Joseph Stiglitz]]'s idea of [[Prizes as an alternative to patents|providing "prize money"]] (from a "prize fund" sponsored by the government) as a substitute for the lost profits associated with abstaining from the monopoly given by a patent.&lt;ref name=Stiglitz/&gt; Another approach is to remove the issue of financing development from the private sphere altogether, and to cover the costs with direct government funding.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Dean. "The Reform of Intellectual Property". post-autistic economics review, issue no. 32, 5 July 2005, article 1, [http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue32/Baker32.htm Paecon.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Atlas of North American English: Phonetics, Phonology and Sound Change''''' (abbreviated '''ANAE'''; formerly, the&amp;nbsp;''Phonological Atlas of North America'') is an overview of the pronunciation patterns ([[accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]]) in all the major urbanized regional [[dialect]]s of the [[English language]] spoken in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It is the result of a large-scale survey by linguists [[William Labov]], Sharon Ash, and [[Charles Boberg]]. Speech data was collected, mainly during the 1990s, by means of telephone interviews with individuals in metropolitan areas in all regions of the U.S. and Canada. Using acoustic analysis of speech from these interviews, ''ANAE'' traces sound changes in progress in North American English, and defines boundaries between dialect regions based on the different sound changes taking place in them.

''The Atlas of North American English'' received the [[Leonard Bloomfield Book Award]] at the 2008 meeting of the Linguistic Society of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/leonard-bloomfield-book-award-previous-holders|title = Leonard Bloomfield Book Award Previous Holders|date = |accessdate = January 11, 2015|website = |publisher = Linguistic Society of America|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notation==
{{IPA notice}}
ANAE employs a "binary" phonemic notation system designed to be maximally abstract and economical so that it can be used to describe [[chain shift]]s with ease. The [[checked vowel]]s are represented by single letters, and each of the diphthongs and historically long vowels is represented by a nuclear vowel followed by a glide, {{IPA|/y/}}, {{IPA|/w/}} or {{IPA|/h/}}. {{IPA|/y/}} represents any kind of front upglide {{IPA|[j, i, ɪ, e, ɛ]}}, {{IPA|/w/}} represents any kind of back upglide {{IPA|[w, u, ʊ, o, ɤ]}}, and {{IPA|/h/}} represents an inglide or long monophthong.{{sfnp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=11–15}} The following tables provide a comparison between ANAE's notation and [[Help:IPA/English|Wikipedia's diaphonemic transcription system]].

==Overview of results==

The Atlas defines several major dialect regions on the basis of distinctive phonological patterns and sound changes taking place in them—often [[chain shift]]s among the vowel phonemes. Major regions include:
* [[Inland Northern American English|The North]], characterized by the [[Northern Cities Vowel Shift]]
* [[Canadian English|Canada]], characterized by the [[Canadian Vowel Shift]]
* Several [[New England English|dialects in New England]], characterized by different combinations of the [[cot-caught merger]] and [[rhoticity in English|non-rhoticity]]
* [[New York City English|New York City]], characterized by non-rhoticity and a complex pattern of [[æ-tensing]]
* [[Mid-Atlantic American English|The Mid-Atlantic region]], including [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia]] and [[Baltimore English|Baltimore]], characterized by complex æ-tensing, rhoticity, and the fronting of the back vowels /aw/, /ow/, /uw/
* [[Southern American English|The South]], characterized by monophthongization of /ay/ and resulting Southern Vowel Shift
* [[Midland American English|The Midland]], characterized by the fronting of back vowels without the monophthongization of /ay/
* [[Western American English|The West]], characterized by ''cot''-''caught'' merger and the absence of the distinctive features of the adjacent regions

On the basis of changes such as the Northern Cities Vowel Shift and the Canadian Shift, the Atlas concludes that regions are becoming more dissimilar to each other, and thus the dialect diversity of North America is increasing.

'''''The Beacon Light''''' is a painting by [[J. M. W. Turner]]. It was given to the [[National Museum of Wales]] by the Davies sisters ([[Gwendoline Davies|Gwendoline]] and [[Margaret Davies|Margaret]]). For some time it was regarded as a fake, but is now accepted as authentic.

==Provenance==
''Beacon Light'' was among a number of works that were said to have been given by Turner to his mistress, Mrs Booth. It was sold at Christie's by her son, John Pound (her son by her first marriage).

In 1922, it was sold as a genuine Turner and the Davies sisters (Gwendoline and Margaret) spent £2,625 to buy it.&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann, Luke; "The Davies sisters' Turners in Cardiff"; ''British Art Journal'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/industry-to-impressionism/ Museum of Wales] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011163636/http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/industry-to-impressionism/ |date=11 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of Gwendoline Davies, it was among seven works by Turner that were donated to the National Museum of Wales.

==Doubts as to authenticity==
Shortly after the donation, doubts were raised about its authenticity and that of two other Turners donated by the sisters.

Butlin and Joll dated the work to c1835-40 and suggest that it is a fragment of a larger canvas 'which has certainly been worked on by a hand other than Turner's'.&lt;ref&gt;Butlin, Martin, and Evelyn Joli. ''The Paintings of J. M. W. Turner''&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, it was believed to depict the Needles on the Isle of Wight

It was removed from display, but did appear in a 2007 exhibition. It returned to display in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/art/online/?action=show_item&amp;item=1836 National Museum of Wales]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Fake or Fortune?''==
It was featured on the BBC TV programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' Scientific analysis showed that the paint used was consistent with Turner's known usage and that the same paint had been used for the whole of the picture. An X-ray showed that a lighthouse at the summit of the bluff had been painted over. [[Philip Mould]] and [[Bendor Grosvenor]] were able to establish that the scene was near [[Margate]] and not on the [[Isle of Wight]] as had been previously believed. The evidence for the painting's authenticity was presented to [[Martin Butlin]], the co-author of the Turner ''[[catalogue raisonné]]'', who accepted that the work was genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode| title = Turner: A Miscarriage of Justice?|series = Fake or Fortune?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01n39kg|accessdate = 10 December 2012|network = BBC|date = 23 September 2012|seriesno=2|number=2|transcript =| transcripturl =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bowls Player''''' is an 1857 bronze statue by the Danish sculptor [[Georg Christian Freund]]. It is a modern adaptation of classical sculptures of athletes such as [[Polykleitos]]'s ''[[Doryphoros]]'' and [[Myron]]'s ''[[Discobolus]]''.

The plaster model for the work and the first casting from it were lost in the fire which destroyed the [[Christiansborg Palace]] in Copenhagen in 1884. Three other casts are known to survive:
*[[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]], Copenhagen
*[[National Gallery of Denmark]], Copenhagen
*[[Alte Nationalgalerie]], Berlin - previously owned by the archaeologist [[Theodor Wiegand]] and now on long-term loan to his house in [[Berlin-Dahlem]], where it is displayed on the terrace as it was during Wiegand's lifetime

'''''The Motorcycle Diaries''''' ({{lang-es|Diarios de Motocicleta|links=no}}) is a [[memoir]] that traces the early travels of [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Ernesto "Che" Guevara]], then a 23-year-old medical student, and his friend [[Alberto Granado]], a 29-year-old biochemist. Leaving [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], in January 1952 on the back of a sputtering single cylinder 1939 [[Norton Motorcycle Company|Norton]] 500cc dubbed ''La Poderosa'' ("The Mighty One"), they desired to explore the South America they only knew from books.&lt;ref name="on_the_trail"&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/2004/12/19/travel/19che.html On the Trail of the Young Che Guevara] by Rachel Dodes, ''The New York Times'', December 19, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; During the formative odyssey Guevara is transformed by witnessing the social injustices of exploited mine workers, persecuted [[communists]], ostracized [[lepers]], and the tattered descendants of a once-great [[Inca civilization]]. By journey's end, they had travelled for a [[Childbirth|symbolic nine months]] by motorcycle, steamship, raft, horse, bus, and hitchhiking, covering more than {{convert|8000|km|miles}} across places such as the [[Andes]], [[Atacama Desert]], and the [[Amazon River Basin]]. The diary ends with a declaration by Guevara, born into an upper-middle-class family, displaying his willingness to fight and die for the cause of the poor, and his dream of seeing a united Latin America.

Ernesto Guevara spent long periods traveling around Latin America during his studies of medicine, beginning in 1948, at the [[University of Buenos Aires]]. In January 1950, Guevara attempted his first voyage. He traversed {{convert|4500|km|miles}} through the northern provinces of Argentina on a bicycle on which he installed a small engine. He arrived at San Francisco del Chañar, near [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], where his friend Alberto Granado ran the dispensary of the leper-centre. This experience allowed Guevara to have long conversations with the patients about their disease.

This pre-expedition gave Guevara a taste of what would be experienced in his more extensive South American travels. The journey broke new ground for him in activities that would become central to his life: travelling and writing a diary.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Che: A Revolutionary Life|date=1997|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=0-8021-3558-7|edition=First Paperback|location=New York, New York, USA|last1=Anderson|first1=John Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|65}} His own father said that it was preparation for his subsequent long journeys across South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lynch|first1=Ernesto Guevara|editor1-last=De Toledo|editor1-first=Lucía Álvarez|title=Young Che: Memories of Che Guevara by his Father|date=2008|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York, New York, USA|isbn=978-0-307-39044-8|page=159|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guevara relied upon the hospitality of strangers that he encountered, as he and Granado would throughout their later travels. For example, following a puncture, he flagged down a lorry to take him to his next destination.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Che Guevara|date=2010|publisher=HarperCollins Ltd|isbn=978-1-44340-566-9|edition=First Canadian|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|last1=De Toledo|first1=Lucía Álvarez}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|63}} In another instance, in [[Loreto, Santiago del Estero|Loreto]], he asked for hospitality from a local police officer when he had nowhere to stay.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|54}} The trip encouraged Guevara's style of traveling that would be seen in the Motorcycle Diaries.

It was the success of his Argentinian 'raid', as he so put it, that awakened in him a desire to explore the world and prompted the commencing of new travel plans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|65}}

Upon completion of his bicycle journey, ''[[El Gráfico]]'', a sports magazine in Argentina, published a picture of Guevara on the motorbike he used for the journey. The company that manufactured the engine Ernesto adapted to his bicycle tried to use it for advertising claiming it was very strong since Guevara had gone on such a long tour using its power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.companeroche.com/index.php?id=40|title=the truth about Che Guevara: Adulthood|last=Hunt|first=Nigel|website=www.companeroche.com|language=en|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he continued studying, he also worked as a nurse on trading and petroleum ships of the Argentine national shipping-company. This allowed Guevara to travel from the south of [[Argentina]] to [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Trinidad]].

{{quote|"This isn't a tale of derring-do, nor is it merely some kind of 'cynical account'; it isn't meant to be, at least. It's a chunk of two lives running parallel for a while, with common aspirations and similar dreams. In nine months a man can think a lot of thoughts, from the height of philosophical conjecture to the most abject longing for a bowl of soup – in perfect harmony with the state of his stomach. And if, at the same time, he's a bit of an adventurer, he could have experiences which might interest other people and his random account would read something like this diary."| Diary introduction}}

In January 1952 Guevara's older friend, [[Alberto Granado]], a biochemist, and Guevara, decided to take a year off from their medical studies to embark on a trip they had spoken of making for years: traversing South America on a motorcycle, which has metaphorically been compared to carbureted version of [[Don Quixote]]'s [[Rocinante]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/SB109597854336326564.htm Easy Revolutionary: Che Guevara Loves and Bikes In Fine 'Motorcycle Diaries'] by Joe Morgenstern, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', September 24, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Guevara and the 29-year-old Granado soon set off from [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]], astride a 1939 Norton 500 cc [[motorcycle]] they named ''La Poderosa II'' ("The Mighty II") with the idea of eventually spending a few weeks volunteering at the [[San Pablo, Peru|San Pablo]] Leper colony in [[Peru]] on the banks of the [[Amazon River]]. In total, the journey took Guevara through [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Panama]], and to [[Miami]], before returning home to [[Buenos Aires]].

[[Image:Che Guevara-Granado - Mapa 1er viaje - 1952.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Map of Guevara's trip with [[Alberto Granado]]. The red arrows correspond to trips by airplane, the last two of which Guevara took alone]]

The trip was carried out in the face of some opposition by Guevara's parents, who knew that their son was both a severe [[asthmatic]] and a medical student close to completing his studies. However, Granado, himself a doctor, assuaged their concerns by guaranteeing that Guevara would return to finish his degree (which he ultimately did).&lt;ref name="Telegraph11"&gt;[http://www.ottawacitizen.com/story_print.html?id=4431515&amp;sponsor= He Rode with Che]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', March 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The first stop: Miramar, Argentina, a small resort where Guevara's girlfriend, Chichina, was spending the summer with her upper-class family. Two days stretched into eight, and upon leaving, Chichina gave Guevara a gold bracelet. The two men crossed into [[Chile]] on February 14. At one point they introduced themselves as internationally renowned leprosy experts to a local newspaper, which wrote a glowing story about them. The travelers later used the press clipping as a way to score meals and other favors with locals along the way.

{{quote|"We are looking for the bottom part of the town. We talk to many beggars. Our noses inhale attentively the misery."| Guevara's entry on [[Valparaíso, Chile]]}}

In reference to his experience in [[Chile]], Guevara also writes: "The most important effort that needs to be done is to get rid of the uncomfortable '[[Yankee]]-friend'. It is especially at this moment an immense task, because of the great amount of dollars they have invested here and the convenience of using economical pressure whenever they believe their interests are being threatened."

There we understood that our vocation, our true vocation, was to move for eternity along the roads and seas of the world. Always curious, looking into everything that came before our eyes, sniffing out each corner but only very faintly – not setting down roots in any land or staying long enough to see the substratum of things; the outer limits would suffice."

Unable to get a boat to [[Easter Island]] as they intended, they headed north, where Guevara's political consciousness began to stir as he and Granado moved into mining country.&lt;ref name="Che Guevara 2005, pg 9"&gt;Che Guevara: Symbol of Struggle, by Tony Saunois, CWI, 2005, {{ISBN|1-870958-34-9}} pg 9&lt;/ref&gt; They visited [[Chuquicamata]] copper mine, the world's largest open-pit mine and the primary source of Chile's wealth. While getting a tour of the mine he asked how many men died in its creation. At the time it was run by U.S. mining monopolies of [[Anaconda Copper|Anaconda]] and [[Kennecott Utah Copper|Kennecott]] and thus was viewed by many as a symbol of "[[imperialist]] gringo domination".&lt;ref name="Che Guevara 2005, pg 9"/&gt; A meeting with a homeless [[communist]] couple in search of mining work made a particularly strong impression on Guevara, who wrote: "By the light of the single candle ... the contracted features of the worker gave off a mysterious and tragic air ... the couple, frozen stiff in the desert night, hugging one another, were a live representation of the [[proletariat]] of any part of the world,"

In reference to the oppression against the Communist party in Chile, which at the time was outlawed, Guevara said: "It's a great pity, that they repress people like this. Apart from whether [[collectivism]], the ‘communist vermin,’ is a danger to decent life, the [[communism]] gnawing at his entrails was no more than a natural longing for something better, a [[Class struggle|protest]] against persistent hunger transformed into a love for this [[Marxist theory|strange doctrine]], whose essence he could never grasp but whose translation, 'bread for the poor,' was something he understood and, more importantly, that filled him with hope. Needless to say, workers at [[Chuquicamata]] were in a living [[Hell]]."

{{rquote|right|The trip would not have been as useful and beneficial as it was, as a personal experience, if the motorcycle had held out. This gave us a chance to become familiar with the people.

In [[Peru]], Guevara was impressed by the old [[Inca civilization]], forced to ride in trucks with Indians and animals after ''"The Mighty One"'' broke down. As a result, he began to develop a fraternity with the indigenous [[Peasant|campesinos]]. In March 1952 they both arrived at the Peruvian [[Tacna]]. After a discussion about the [[poverty]] in the region, Guevara referred in his notes to the words of Cuban poet [[José Marti]]: "I want to link my destiny to that of the poor of this world." In May they arrived in [[Lima]], [[Peru]] and during this time Guevara met doctor [[Hugo Pesce]], a Peruvian scientist, director of the national leprosy program, and an important local Marxist. They discussed several nights until the early morning and years later Che identified these conversations as being very important for his evolution in attitude towards life and society.

In May, Guevara and Granado left for the [[leper colony]] of San Pablo in the Peruvian [[Amazon Rainforest]], arriving there in June. During his stay Guevara complained about the miserable way the people and sick of that region had to live. Guevara also swam once from the side of the [[Amazon River]] where the doctors stayed, to the other side of the river where the [[leper]] patients lived, a considerable distance of {{convert|4|km|miles}}. He describes how there were no clothes, almost no food, and no medication. However, Guevara was moved by his time with the [[lepers]], remarking that

{{quote|"All the love and caring just consist on coming to them without gloves and medical attire, shaking their hands as any other neighbor and sitting together for a chat about anything or playing football with them."&lt;ref name = "A1950"&gt;[http://www.companeroche.com/index.php?id=40 Ernesto Che Guevara: 1950-1953]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:CheOnRaft1952.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Guevara (right) with [[Alberto Granado]] (left) aboard their "Mambo-Tango" wooden raft on the [[Amazon River]] in June 1952. The raft was a gift from the [[lepers]] whom they had treated]]

After giving consultations and treating patients for a few weeks, Guevara and Granado left aboard the Mambo-Tango raft (shown) for [[Leticia, Colombia]] via the [[Amazon River]].

While visiting [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]], he wrote a letter to his mother on July 6, 1952. In the letter he described the conditions under the [[right-wing]] government of [[Conservative]] [[Laureano Gómez]] as the following: "There is more repression of individual freedom here than in any country we've been to, the police patrol the streets carrying rifles and demand your papers every few minutes". He also goes on to describe the atmosphere as "tense" and "suffocating" even hypothesizing that "a revolution may be brewing". Guevara was correct in his prognostication, as a military [[coup]] in 1953 would take place, bringing General [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla|Gustavo Rojas]] to power.

Later that month Guevara arrived in [[Caracas]], Venezuela and from there decided to return to [[Buenos Aires]] to finish his studies in medical science. However, prior to his return, he travelled by cargo plane to [[Miami]], where the airplane's technical problems delayed him one month. To survive, he worked as a waiter and washed dishes in a Miami bar.

Although he admitted throughout that as a [[vagabond (person)|vagabond]] traveler he could only see things at surface level, he did attempt to delve beneath the sheen of the places he visited. On one occasion he went to see a woman dying of tuberculosis, leaving appalled by the failings of the public health system. This experience led him to ruminate the following reflection: "How long this present order, based on the absurd idea of caste, will last is not within my means to answer, but it's time that those who govern spent less time publicizing their own virtues and more money, much more money, funding socially useful works."

{{quote|"It is at times like this, when a doctor is conscious of his complete powerlessness, that he longs for change: a change to prevent the injustice of a system in which only a month ago this poor woman was still earning her living as a waitress, wheezing and panting but facing life with dignity. In circumstances like this, individuals in poor families who can’t pay their way become surrounded by an atmosphere of barely disguised acrimony; they stop being father, mother, sister or brother and become a purely negative factor in the struggle for life and, consequently, a source of bitterness for the healthy members of the community who resent their illness as if it were a personal insult to those who have to support them."| Guevara while treating a peasant woman dying of [[tuberculosis]]}}

Witnessing the widespread endemic [[poverty]], [[oppression]] and [[disenfranchisement]] throughout Latin America, and influenced by his readings of Marxist literature, Guevara later decided that the only solution for the region's [[Social structure|structural]] inequalities was armed [[revolution]]. His travels and readings throughout this journey  also led him to view Latin America not as a group of separate nations, but as a single entity requiring a continent-wide strategy for [[Liberty|liberation]] from what he viewed as [[Imperialism|imperialist]] and [[neo-colonialism|neo-colonial]] domination. His conception of a borderless, united, Hispanic-America sharing a common '[[mestizo]]' bond, was a theme that would prominently recur during his later activities and transformation from Ernesto the traveler, into [[Che Guevara]] the iconic revolutionary.

{{quote|I knew that when the great guiding spirit cleaves humanity into two antagonistic halves, I will be with the people.| Guevara's conclusion}}

Although it is considered to be formative, scholars have largely ignored this period of Guevara's life.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Che's Travels: The Making of a Revolutionary in 1950s Latin America|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0822391805|location=Durham [NC]|last1=Drinot|first1=Paulo}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|2}} However, historians and biographers now agree that the experience had a profound impact on Guevara, who later became one of the most famous [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] leaders in history. "His political and social awakening has very much to do with this face-to-face contact with poverty, exploitation, illness, and suffering", said Carlos M. Vilas, a history professor at the Universidad Nacional de Lanús in Buenos Aires, Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1014_041014_motorcycle_diaries.html|title="Motorcycle Diaries" Shows Che Guevara at Crossroads|website=news.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, [[Alberto Granado]] described their journey to the [[BBC]], stating: "The most important thing was to realise that we had a common sensibility for the things that were wrong and unjust." According to Granado, their time at the [[leper colony]] of San Pablo in the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] also proved pivotal. Recalling that they shared everything with the sick people and describing Guevara's wave on departure as follows: "I got the impression that Che was saying goodbye to institutional medicine and becoming a doctor of the people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4518213.stm|title='My best friend Che'|date=2005-05-09|newspaper=BBC|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Granado later observed that by the end of their journey, "We were just a pair of [[Vagabond (person)|vagabonds]] with knapsacks on our backs, the dust of the road covering us, mere shadows of our old [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] egos."&lt;ref name = "lettersNYT" /&gt;

According to his daughter [[Aleida Guevara]] in a 2004 article, throughout the book we can see how Guevara became aware that what poor people needed was not his scientific knowledge as a doctor, but his strength and persistence to bring social change.&lt;ref name="aleida"&gt;{{cite news |title=Riding My Father's Motorcycle |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/09/opinion/09guevara.html?_r=2&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=motorcycle+diaries&amp;st=nyt&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin |author=Aleida Guevara |date=2008-10-09|accessdate=2008-04-08 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

Guevara's experience of the South American continent also helped to shape his revolutionary sensibilities. When discussing the plight of the downtrodden Indians of Peru, Granado discussed the formation of an Indian political party to begin a [[Túpac Amaru]] Indian Revolution. Guevara allegedly replied "Revolution without firing a shot? You're crazy?'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Toledo|first1=Lucía Álvarez|title=The Story of Che Guevara|date=2010|publisher=HarperCollins Ltd|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|isbn=978-1-44340-566-9|page=86|edition=First Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journey was also formative in his political beliefs, for example historian Paulo Drinot notes that the journey stimulated his sentiments of [[Pan-Americanism]] that would later shape his revolutionary behaviors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|8}}

Scholar Lucía Álvarez De Toledo argues that it was on these motorcycle travels that he "disregarded his social class and his white European racial ancestry" and retained the view of himself as an Argentine, as a member of the United America he had encountered during his travels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Toledo|first1=Lucía Álvarez|title=The Story of Che Guevara|date=2010|publisher=HarperCollins Ltd|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|isbn=978-1-44340-566-9|page=93|edition=First Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having said this, with the exception of Guatemala, Guevara showed little concern with the policies of the countries he encountered.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|4}} In total however, Guevara's travels in the 1950s played an important role in determining his view on the world "and his later revolutionary trajectory."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|17}}

==Editions==
In 2004, Che Guevara's daughter, [[Aleida Guevara]], explained that her father had not intended his diary to be published, and that it had the state of "a sheaf of typewritten pages". But already in the 1980s, his family worked on his unpublished manuscripts, and a Cuban publishing house brought out ''The Motorcycle Diaries'' for the first time in 1993.&lt;ref name="aleida" /&gt;

The director of Ocean Press insists that the book had been legally published in Cuba and that any rumors of a conspiracy to prohibit its publication there are false. He also points out that the Union of Young Communists brought out an edition, with another to be published by the Che Guevara Studies Center.  Furthermore, he has given an assurance that its publication has the support of many people including [[Fidel Castro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E5DA1731F931A35755C0A9629C8B63&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=motorcycle+diaries&amp;st=nyt|title=Che Guevara's Diaries (letter to the editor|author1=David Deutschmann |author2=Publisher and President |author3=Ocean Press) |publisher=New York Times|date=2008-06-02|accessdate=2008-04-08}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Motorcycle Diaries:  Notes on a Latin American Journey'' was published by Ocean Press and the Che Guevara Studies Center, Havana, in 2003.  The book has a preface by Aleida Guevara March and an introduction by Cintio Vitier.  This edition is edited and translated by Alexandra Keeble.

===Editing===
Some observers have questioned the full veracity of the work based on its editing. Michael Casey wrote that, "''Diaries'' is not a diary at all but rather a deliberately constructed memoir that the young Ernesto fashioned and embellished."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casey|first1=Michael|title=Che's Afterlife: The Legacy of an Image|date=April 2009|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York, New York, USA|isbn=978-0-307-27930-9|page=52|edition=A Vintage Books Original}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casey argues that revisions such as these cause Guevara to blur the line between fiction and nonfiction in his writings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other scholars have taken this claim even further. Frans Weiser argues that Guevara was not the only person that was editing and reshaping his notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weiser|first1=Frans|title=Writing "Che" Writing: Apocryphal Diaries and the Deconstruction of Guevara's Myth|journal=Hispania|date=4 December 2013|volume=96|issue=4|page=703|doi=10.1353/hpn.2013.0126|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/531376/pdf|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Paulo Drinot contends that the Cuban government, as well as others, reworked the texts for self-fashioning or political benefits.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, Drinot also points out that Guevara's introduction explicitly mentions how the notes are "reorganized" and "polished", and that such a practicality should in no way undermine its utility as a historical source.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|8}}

==Review==
{{Quote|"Guevara's youthful Motorcycle Diaries is rebellious in ways that are not immediately obvious. This travelogue shows Ernesto the Medical Student developing a sense of Pan-Latin Americanism that fuses the interests of indigenous Andean peasants with traditional adversaries like upper-middle-class Argentine intellectuals (i.e. Guevara). The book ventures a unified regional opposition to U.S. hegemony and global capitalism's sometimes ravaging effects on Latin America."| [[World Hum]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldhum.com/features/travel-books/nine-subversive-travel-books-non-fiction-20091109/ Nine Subversive Travel Books] by Thomas Kohnstamm, ''[[World Hum]]'', January 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6172">{{Italic title}}'''''The Rise of Victimhood Culture: Microaggressions, Safe Spaces, and the New Culture Wars''''', is a 2018 book by sociologists [[Bradley Campbell (sociologist)|Bradley Campbell]] and [[Jason Manning]].

==History==
The book began as a scholarly paper entitled ''Microaggression and Moral Cultures'' published in the journal ''Comparative Sociology'' in 2014.&lt;ref name=CompSoc&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Campbell |first1=Bradley |last2=Manning |first2=Jason |title=Microaggression and Moral Cultures |journal=Comparative Sociology |date=2014 |volume=13 |issue=6 |page=692 |url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15691330-12341332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedersdorf"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Friedersdorf |first1=Conor |title=The Rise of Victimhood Culture |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/the-rise-of-victimhood-culture/404794/ |accessdate=31 May 2018 |publisher=[[The Atlantic]] |date=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell and Manning argue that accusations of [[microaggression]] focus on unintentional slights, unlike the [[Civil rights movement]], which focused on concrete injustices.  They argue that the purpose of calling attention to microaggressions is less to elevate the status of offended victim. "When the victims publicize micoaggressions,” wrote  Campbell and Manning “they call attention to what they see as the deviant behavior of the offenders. In doing so,” they “also call attention to their own victimization.”   They do this because it lowers “the offender’s moral status” and “raises the moral status of the victims.”&lt;ref name=CompSoc/&gt;&lt;ref name="BarbashCampuses"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barbash |first1=Fred |title=The war on ‘microaggressions:’ Has it created a ‘victimhood culture’ on campuses? |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/10/28/the-war-over-words-literally-on-some-american-campuses-where-asking-where-are-you-from-is-a-microaggression/ |accessdate=1 June 2018 |publisher=Washington Post |date=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WayneAbout"/&gt;

==Thesis==
In both the paper and the book, Mason and Campbell draw on the work of sociologist [[Donald Black (sociologist)|Donald Black]] on conflict and on cross-cultural studies of conflict and morality to argue that the contemporary culture wars resemble tactics described by scholars in which an aggrieved party or group seeks the support of third parties.  They argue that  grievance-based conflicts ave led to large-scale moral change in which an emergent victimhood culture is clashing with and replacing older honor and dignity cultures.&lt;ref name=CompSoc/&gt;

Honour cultures, often called [[shame society|honour-shame cultures]] are cultures like that of the [[old west|old time American West]] or Europe in the era when dueling was common.&lt;ref name="Friedersdorf"/&gt;  In such cultures, honour is paramount, and when it is offended, the offended party retaliated directly, by, for example, engaging in a [[blood feud]].  In honor cultures, victims have an extremely low moral status.&lt;ref name="WayneAbout"/&gt;

Mason and Campbell describe honour-shame culture as having been replaced in the modern Western world in the 19th and 20th century by a dignity culture where, “insults might provoke offense, but they no longer have the same importance as a way of establishing or destroying a reputation for bravery.” Instead, “When intolerable conflicts do arise, dignity cultures prescribe direct but non-violent actions.”&lt;ref name=CompSoc/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedersdorf"/&gt;  In such a culture, instead of challenging the offender to a duel, an aggrieved party might “exercise covert avoidance, quietly cutting off relations with the offender without any confrontation” or  “conceptualize the problem as a disruption to their relationship and seek only to restore harmony without passing judgment.” Legal action was taken, “For offenses like theft, assault, or breach of contract, people in a dignity culture will use law without shame,... “But in keeping with their ethic of restraint and toleration, it is not necessarily their first resort, and they might condemn many uses of the authorities as frivolous. People might even be expected to tolerate serious but accidental personal injuries.”&lt;ref name=CompSoc/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedersdorf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HennenReview"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hennen |first1=Anthony |title=The Dictatorship of the Offended(Book Review) |url=https://www.jamesgmartin.center/2018/04/the-dictatorship-of-the-offended/ |accessdate=1 June 2018 |publisher=James G. Martin Center for Academic Renewal |date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dignity culture, according to Campbell and Manning, has moral values and behavioral norms that promote the value of every human life, encouraging achievement in its children while teaching that [[Sticks and Stones|sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never break me]].&lt;ref name="CampbellReview"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Campbell |first1=Claire |title=The War on Dignity (book review) |publisher=[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]] |date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because victimhood culture now confers the highest moral status on victims, Campbell and Manning argue that it “increases the incentive to publicize grievances.”  Injured and offended parties who might once have thrown a punch or filed a law suit, now  appeal for support on social media.&lt;ref name="WayneAbout"/&gt;

According to Campbell and  Manning, victimhood culture engenders “competitive victimhood,” incentivizing even privileged people to claim that they are victims of, for example [[reverse discrimination]].&lt;ref name="WayneAbout"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wayne |first1=Teddy |title=The Microcomplaint: Nothing Too Small to Whine About |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/fashion/the-microcomplaint-nothing-too-small-to-whine-about.html |accessdate=1 June 2018 |publisher=New York Times |date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodoor Gautier Thomas Pigeaud''' (20 February 1899 in [[Leipzig]] – 6 March 1988 in [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]]) was an expert in [[Java]]nese literature from the [[Netherlands]]. He especially became famous for his Java-Netherlands dictionary (1938) that Poerwadarminto chose as foundation of ''Baoesastra Djawa''. Moreover, Pigeaud was also known because of his monumental study about ''[[Nagarakretagama]]'' and text catalogues of the manuscripts in the libraries of [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]], and [[Germany]].

The '''Theology Institute of Azerbaijan''' is a [[Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani]] higher education institution specializing in theology. It operates under the direction of the [[The State Committee on Religious Associations of the Republic of Azerbaijan|State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations of the Republic of Azerbaijan]] ({{Lang-az|Azərbaycan Respublikasının Dini Qurumlarla İş üzrə Dövlət Komitəsinin tabeliyində Azərbaycan İlahiyyat İnstitutu}}). The rector of the University is Jeyhun Mammadov.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.azernews.az/nation/137676.html|title=Opening ceremony of Azerbaijan Institute of Theology held in Baku|last=|first=|date=2018-09-17|work=AzerNews.az|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, three departments and one faculty comprise the institution. Education is carried out in Azerbaijani.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://azertag.az/xeber/Azerbaycan_Ilahiyyat_Institutunun_achilisi_olub-1195028|title=Azərbaycan İlahiyyat İnstitutunun açılışı olub|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Institute was developed under the auspices of the State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations of the Republic of Azerbaijan. A decree of the [[President of Azerbaijan|President of the Republic of Azerbaijan]] dated 9 February 2018 authorized its creation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://president.az/articles/27001|title=Azərbaycan İlahiyyat İnstitutunun yaradılması haqqında Azərbaycan Respublikası Prezidentinin Sərəncamı|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decree ensured inclusion of the faculty of Theology of the [[Baku State University]] in the Institute of Theology.

The opening ceremony took place on September 17, 2018.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Logo ==
The Institute announced a contest on 26 July 2018 to organize its logo. For this purpose, a commission was created, consisting of:

* Yagut Aliyeva, the Director of the Public Relations Department of the State Committee for Religious Organizations
* Eldar Mikayilzade, the People's Artist of Azerbaijan
* Zaur Orujov, the scientific worker of the [[Institute of Manuscripts of Azerbaijan]]
* Kevser Tagiyev, the teacher of the Azerbaijan Institute of Theology

106 different logos were presented. On 8 August the submission of Konul Mammadzadeh was chosen. According to the unanimous opinion of the commission, the logo reflected the purpose and mission of the Institute. Specifically, the human symbol whose hands are turned toward the sky reflects how multiculturalism and tolerance communicate with God, the book represents the main source of knowledge, and the olive branch expresses peace and spirituality.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://report.az/din/i-lahiyyat-i-nstitutunun-loqosu-mueyyenlesib/|title=İlahiyyat İnstitutunun loqosu müəyyənləşib|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The purpose of the institute is to ensure the preservation and development of the religious and spiritual environment, based on the historical traditions of the Azerbaijani people. Philosophy, sociology, psychology, multiculturalism, informatics and other social and humanitarian sciences are to be taught along with religious sciences. 35 places for Islamic studies and 25 places for Religious studies were approved for the academic year 2018-2019.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations of the Republic of Azerbaijan has allocated a scholarship named after [[Heydar Aliyev]] for one student. The Caucasian Muslim Office allocated a monthly scholarship to one student.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Administration ==
Jeyhun Mammadov was appointed as the rector of the institute on May 31, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://president.az/articles/28878|title=C.V.Məmmədovun Azərbaycan İlahiyyat İnstitutunun rektoru təyin edilməsi haqqında Azərbaycan Respublikası Prezidentinin Sərəncamı|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Prorector]] of the Institute was appointed on 13 September 2018.

'''Tickling games''' are interpersonal or social activities involving the [[tickling]] of one person by another. Some people find tickling to not only be a pleasurable experience, but also an [[erotic]] one. They may be [[sexual arousal|sexually excited]] by being tickled or by tickling another person.&lt;ref name=Love&gt;Love B., ''Encyclopedia of Unusual Sex Practices.'' New York: Barricade Books Inc.; 1992. p280-281.&lt;/ref&gt; Some engage in tickling games as part of a social act.

==Terminology==
'''[[Knismesis and gargalesis|Knismolagnia]]''' is the experience of "arousal from [[tickling]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | page=375 |title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unususal Sexual Practices|first=Anil|last=Aggrawal|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|year=2009|ISBN=978-1-4200-4308-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Acarophilia]]''', often confused{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} with knismolagnia, refers to arousal from scratching.

Excessive tickling has been described as a primary sexual obsession and, under these circumstances, is sometimes considered a form of [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Havelock Ellis|Ellis H.]] ''Studies in the psychology of sex.'' Vol. iii. Philadelphia: FA Davis Co.; 1926&lt;/ref&gt; People whose [[human sexuality|sexuality]] is based almost solely on tickling can be said to have a tickling fixation. This [[Fixation (psychology)|fixation]] may also exist outside of sexual contexts.

==Overview==
Consensual tickling can be regarded as a form of [[physical intimacy]] as it involves the touching of one person's body by another. It could serve as a [[human bonding|bonding experience]] between friends, or a simple act of familiarity and trust. Between adults, it sometimes functions as an outlet for sexual energy, with [[erotic]] games, [[foreplay]] and [[Human sexual activity|sex]] being the primary methods of doing such.

==Tickling games==
[[File:Tickling fetish.jpg|thumb|A woman being tickled at [[EXXXOTICA]] New York 2009]]
Some people take part in tickling games or contests which test their endurance to being tickled, for amusement, erotic pleasure, or other reasons. These games may involve some form of [[Bondage (BDSM)|physical restraint]] of the person to be tickled to prevent them protecting the ticklish spots or otherwise interfering with the game. Common positions for tickling are the [[over-arm tie]], the [[hogtie bondage|hogtie]], [[Spreadeagle (position)|spread-eagle]], with the person being [[rope bondage|tied up]], [[Bondage cuffs|cuffed]] or in [[stocks]]. The restraints may be left loose to increase the amount of possible movement, but short of the person being able to protect the ticklish spots. On the other hand, some participants prefer very tight bondage. The tied person may also be [[blindfold]]ed to increase the anxiety and surprise element.

The objective of such games is to generate uncontrollable writhing, struggling, laughing and vocalizations etc., from the person being tickled, while the person tries to control such reactions, without the ability to physically defend the ticklish spots.

In [[dominance and submission]] scenarios, [[sexual partner]]s may agree upon a [[safeword]] such as "falafel", "watermelon", or "bicycle" to signal that tickling should stop.
