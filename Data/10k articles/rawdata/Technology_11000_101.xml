'''.design''' is a [[top-level domain]] name. It was proposed in [[ICANN]]'s [[Generic top-level domain#New top-level domains|new generic top-level domain (gTLD) program]], and became available to the general public on May 12, 2015. [[Top Level Design]] is the [[domain name registry]] for the string.

==History==
In September 2014, [[Portland, Oregon]]-based [[Top Level Design]] (TLD) won the right to operate the .design [[top-level domain]] after beating out six other applicants in a private auction. According to TLD's CEO [[Ray King (entrepreneur)|Ray King]], winning the auction was "very important" and one of the company's top priorities, evidenced by its name. He told Domain Name Wire, "Think of all the things that require design. Design permeates all aspects of culture.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allemann|first1=Andrew|title=Top Level Design wins .design contention set|url=http://domainnamewire.com/2014/09/25/top-level-design-wins-design-contention-set/|publisher=Domain Name Wire|accessdate=May 27, 2015|date=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; design domain registrations became available to the general public on May 12, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allemann|first1=Andrew|title=This week’s new TLDs: .Design and four Early Access|url=http://domainnamewire.com/2015/05/12/this-weeks-new-tlds-design-and-four-early-access/|publisher=Domain Name Wire|accessdate=May 27, 2015|date=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to The Domains, more than 5,200 .design domains were registered on the first day of general availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berkens|first1=Michael|title=.Design Winds Up With Over 5K Domain Registrations After 1st Day|url=http://www.thedomains.com/2015/05/14/design-winds-up-with-over-5k-domain-registrations-after-1st-day/|publisher=The Domains|accessdate=May 27, 2015|date=May 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CentralNic]] provides backend services through an exclusive distribution agreement and shares in the global revenues from .design domain names. Ben Crawford, CentralNic's CEO, said of the top-level domain, "It has impressive commercial potential, and it will be adopted more quickly than many other TLDs as it caters, among many other groups, to one of the best-informed professions on new Internet developments – website designers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/73659/centralnic-group-wins-hotly-contested-top-level-domain-battle-73659.html|title=CentralNic Group wins hotly contested top level domain battle|first=John|last=Harrington|date=October 27, 2014|accessdate=October 27, 2014|publisher=Proactive Investors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of .design's launch, King said of the gTLD:

{{Quote|Design has always been fundamental to the way people, companies and products present themselves, and since the elegance of the Apple revolution there has been a conscious embrace of how design is a lot more than just how a product or service looks, but a fundamental carrier of one's message. Beyond that, design is what I call a 'horizontal-vertical', in that it is a broad term, but not generic like .web or .online. It touches on many clear vertical markets such as graphic design, interior design, lighting design, web design, fashion design and many more. These are all distinct markets whose survival depends on them being ahead of the curve and defining future trends — .design does just that.&lt;ref name=Lau&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lau|first1=Richard|title=NamesCon: Spotlight on ICANNWiki|url=http://www.domaininvesting.com/namescon-spotlight-icannwiki/|publisher=DomainInvesting.com|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''AdExtent''' (formally Semantinet) is an Israeli [[Startup Company]] dedicated to developing RTB Display technologies for various ad platforms.

==History==
The brainchild of Tal Muskal, who initially intended to create a development platform for the seamless integration of data, Semantinet was incorporated as a company in December 2006, after receiving a preseed investment from [[Yossi Vardi]].
The company completed hiring its development team in January 2008, and by April the same year the team completed development of the company's initial semantic web engine. Three months later, in July 2008, Semantinet released its first product, the Headup client, as a private [[Software release life cycle#Alpha|Alpha]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altsearchengines.com/2008/07/07/semantinet-the-alt-engine-that-thinks-for-you SemantiNet – The Alt Engine that Thinks for You] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020074405/http://altsearchengines.com/2008/07/07/semantinet-the-alt-engine-that-thinks-for-you/ |date=2008-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October the client was deemed ready for [[Open beta#Beta|Beta]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/headup_smarter_connections_across_social_networks.php Smarter Connections Across Your Social Networks ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416081443/http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/headup_smarter_connections_across_social_networks.php |date=2010-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mashable.com/2008/10/16/semantinet-headup SemantiNet Launches Power-Packed Headup Firefox Add-On]&lt;/ref&gt; and in February 2009 it was approved for distribution via [[Mozilla]]'s [[Firefox]] Addon directory.

In March 2009 Semantinet began the transition from client to server based solutions and in July it started a pilot of a semantic web [[WordPress]] plugin for bloggers. The product was made publicly available via the WordPress plugin directory in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wpgarage.com/plugins/semantic-wordpress-plugin Headup Semantic WordPress plugin automatically adds rich content to your blog]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010 the server based Headup solution was made available as a [[Joomla]] extension and in March it became available as a [[Drupal]] module.

==Products and services==
Semantinet has released to date two applications to Beta. The company's first application, the Headup Semantic Web [[Firefox extension]] enables users to highlight terms appearing in [[web content]] in order to discover related content provided in the extension's overlay window user interface.
The company's second application is the Headup website and blog extension, which automatically identifies and highlights topics appearing in a publisher's web content. Users interacting with the plugin's highlights are provided related articles, images, videos, Tweets, etcetera, via one of three configurable interfaces.

==Management==
Semantinet was founded and is currently managed by Tal Keinan and Tal Muskal, who, like many of Israel's startup community members,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redherring.com/Home/5375 Israeli army grads lead business revolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411235555/http://www.redherring.com/Home/5375 |date=2010-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; served in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] in [[information technology]] related roles. Keinan, who's assumed the role of CEO and serves on the company's board, worked at [[Morgan Stanley]]'s Risk Management Department prior to founding Semantinet, while Muskal, who invented Semantinet's core technology and now serves as its CTO, worked as an [[R&amp;D]] engineer at Go Networks, where he made his first pitch about the technology to Oz Leave, Go Networks' CEO, who now serves as the Chairman of Semantinet's Board of Directors.

==Board of directors==
Semantinet's Board of Directors is composed of one member besides Tal Keinan.
Eyal Niv of Giza Venture Capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gizavc.com/mang.asp#jumpm8 |title=Giza Venture Capital management |access-date=2010-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408033330/http://gizavc.com/mang.asp#jumpm8#jumpm8 |archive-date=2010-04-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eyal Niv funded XtremIO, which was acquired by EMC, and became the fastest growing business ever for EMC.

==Funding==
Semantinet is backed by Giza Venture Capital and a number of [[Angel Investors]] including Yossi Vardi,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vccafe.com/2008/01/25/seantic-web-search-lives-semantinet-got-17-million-from-giza-and-vardi-to-prove-it Semantic web search lives: Semantinet got $1.7 Million from Giza and Vardi to prove it]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeff Pulver]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://pulverblog.pulver.com/archives/008842.html Twitter gets a Semantic Web boost from Headup.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430014919/http://pulverblog.pulver.com/archives/008842.html |date=2010-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sir [[Ronald Mourad Cohen|Ronald Cohen]]. To date the company has raised US$4,400,000.

'''Batter boards''' (or ''battre boards'', Sometimes mispronounced as "battle boads") are temporary [[framing (construction)|frames]], set beyond the corners of a planned [[Foundation (construction)|foundation]] at precise elevations. These batter boards&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionaryofconstruction.com/definition/batter-boards.html&lt;/ref&gt; are then used to hold [[layout line]]s (construction twine) to indicate the limits&lt;ref&gt;http://homeguides.sfgate.com/purpose-batter-boards-laying-foundation-76196.html&lt;/ref&gt; (edges and corners) of the foundation.

'''Benzvalene''' is an [[organic compound]] and one of several [[isomer]]s of [[benzene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1002/anie.198105291| title = Benzvalene—Properties and Synthetic Potential| year = 1981| last1 = Christl | first1 = M.| journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English| volume = 20| issue = 67| pages =  529–546}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first synthesized in 1971 by Thomas J. Katz et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1021/ja00744a045| title = Benzvalene synthesis| year = 1971| last1 = Katz | first1 = T. J.| last2 = Wang | first2 = E. J.| last3 = Acton | first3 = N.| journal = [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]| volume = 93| issue = 15| pages = 3782 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1021/jo990883g| title = Synthesis of Benzvalene | year = 1999| last1 = Katz | first1 = T. J.| last2 = Roth | first2 = R. J.| last3 = Acton | first3 = N.| last4 = Carnahan | first4 = E. J.| journal = The Journal of Organic Chemistry| volume = 64| issue = 20| pages = 7663 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1971 synthesis consisted of treating [[cyclopentadiene]] with [[methyllithium]] in [[dimethyl ether]] and then with [[dichloromethane]] and methyllithium in [[diethyl ether]] at −45&amp;nbsp;°C.  It can also be formed in low yield (along with [[fulvene]] and [[Dewar benzene]]) by irradiation of benzene at 237 to 254 nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Louis|last2=Wilzbach|first2=K. E.|date=1968-06-01|title=Photolysis of benzene vapor. Benzvalene formation at wavelengths 2537-2370 A|url=https://doi.org/10.1021/ja01014a086|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=90|issue=12|pages=3291–3292|doi=10.1021/ja01014a086|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hydrocarbon in solution was described as having an extremely foul odor. Due to the high [[steric strain]] present in benzvalene, the pure compound (~71 kcal/mol higher in energy than benzene) easily detonates, for example by scratching.

The compound converts to benzene with a [[chemical half-life]] of approximately 10 days. This [[symmetry-forbidden]] transition is believed to take place through a [[diradical]] intermediate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cr60276a004| title = Rearrangements and interconversions of compounds of the formula (CH)n| journal = Chemical Reviews| volume = 72| issue = 2| pages = 181| year = 1972| last1 = Scott| first1 = Lawrence T.| last2 = Jones| first2 = Maitland.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polybenzvalene==
Benzvalene can be [[polymerized]] in a [[Ring opening metathesis polymerisation|ROMP]] process to '''polybenzvalene'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1021/ja00217a049| title = Strained rings as a source of unsaturation: polybenzvalene, a new soluble polyacetylene precursor| year = 1988| last1 = Swager | first1 = T. M.| last2 = Dougherty | first2 = D. A.| last3 = Grubbs | first3 = R. H.| journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society| volume = 110| issue = 9| pages = 2973 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This polymer contains  highly strained [[bicyclobutane]] rings which again makes it a sensitive material. The rings can be [[isomerization|isomerized]] to 1,3-dienes and for this reason polybenzvalene has been investigated as a precursor to [[polyacetylene]].

==Products and services==

===Black Hole Quencher dyes===
In 2000, Biosearch Technologies developed a [[dark quencher]] known as the [[Black Hole Quencher]] (BHQ) dyes, which has become an industry standard product and is currently licensed out to a number of other oligonucleotide manufacturers, biotechnology and molecular diagnostic manufacturers.  The series of Black Hole Quencher dyes have no native fluorescence, high signal-to-noise ratios providing greater sensitivity, and exceptional coupling efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Glen Research - Black Hole Quencher Webpage&lt;/ref&gt;  BHQ dyes are able to quench the entire visible spectrum and near IR spectrum, allowing for a broader range of fluorogenic reporter dyes, which makes the Black Hole Quenchers ideal for multiplexing assays.&lt;ref&gt;Sigma Aldrich - Black Hole Quencher Webpage&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluorogenic probes and primers===
The research team at Biosearch Technologies also developed other [[fluorescent dyes]] such as the CAL Fluor, Quasar, and Pulsar series of dyes, which emit fluorescence from 500-700 nanometers. Equipped with the various technology in fluorescent dyes and quenchers, much of Biosearch Technologies' business comes from the design and manufacture of custom probes and primers, which are commonly used for genomic applications such as [[quantitative PCR]] and [[SNP genotyping]].

===ValuPanel reagents===
During the 2009 [[H1N1]] Pandemic, Biosearch Technologies became the first to license from the CDC the H1N1 Influenza and Influenza A sub-typing panel signatures. They would later obtain a license for the “pdm” H1N1 signatures as well. With these licenses from the CDC, Biosearch Technologies manufactured probes and primers to discriminate the various flu signatures as part of their ValuPanel Reagents product line.

In 2013, Biosearch responded to the Avian Influenza A ([[H7N9]]) outbreak in China by providing an H7N9 detection panel.

===Stellaris FISH probes===
{{details|topic=the Stellaris FISH Technology|Fluorescence in situ hybridization#Stellaris FISH probes}}
In 2010, Biosearch Technologies acquired an exclusive license to the single molecule fish technology developed by scientists at [[University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umdnj.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/hpappweb/newsroom.cgi?headline=Foundation+Venture+Capital+Group,+a+Foundation+of+UMDNJ+Affiliate,+Sells+Interest+in+Longevica+Pharmaceuticals&lt;/ref&gt; The technology is now branded as Stellaris FISH, and is a method of detecting and quantifying mRNA and other long RNA molecules in cell culture or tissue samples. The technology is a refinement of earlier RNA [[In situ hybridization|ISH]] technologies, and uses multiple single [[fluorophore|labeled]] [[DNA]] [[hybridization probe|oligonucleotide probes]] to increase [[sensitivity and specificity]].

===Design service - RealTimeDesign===
Biosearch Technologies offers a free, web-based design service known as RealTimeDesign (RTD) equipped with comprehensive algorithms that allow the software to model and propose quantitative PCR and SNP genotyping assays. RealTimeDesign is meant to help scientists craft [[Oligonucleotide synthesis|custom oligonucleotides]], averaging 99% in amplification efficiency through a series of different features offered by the software. Some of those features include a direct link to [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]] and [[BLAST]] databases as well as a selection of user-modifiable parameters.&lt;ref&gt;Genetic Engineering News - RealTimeDesign&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Founding===
Although Biosearch Technologies was founded in 1993, its roots can be traced back to 1979 when it was preceded by Dr. Ronald Cook's first company, Biosearch, Inc.  Biosearch, Inc. experienced 9 years of DNA synthesis instrumentation and chemistry by playing a key role in engineering and manufacturing one of the first automated solid-phase [[Oligonucleotide synthesis|DNA synthesis]] instruments, the SAM I.  As time progressed, Biosearch was also able to bring other DNA synthesizers to market such as the Biosearch 8700, Biosearch 8800 Prep, and the Cyclone.

===Mergers and acquisitions===
In 1987, Biosearch was acquired by New Brunswick Scientific,&lt;ref&gt;New Brunswick Scientific's Company History on Answers.com&lt;/ref&gt; who sold the Biosearch unit to [[Millipore Corporation]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Millipore Corporation's Company History on Answers.com&lt;/ref&gt; By 1989, Biosearch was renamed Milligen-Biosearch.  Due to the loss of several corporate officers, Milligen-Biosearch was subsequently acquired by PerSeptive Biosystems which in turn was acquired by [[Applied Biosystems]] who eventually retired the Biosearch name and products.

After taking a short hiatus, Dr. Cook decided to return to the oligonucleotide industry and founded what is currently known as Biosearch Technologies, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;The Biosearch Story on Biosearchtech.com&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, Biosearch acquired the oligonucleotide manufacturing arm of [[DNA Technology]] and the entirety of [[VitraBio]], a maker of [[porous glass]].&lt;ref name=geneng2013/&gt;

===Recognition in PCR research===
When [[Kary Mullis]] received the Nobel Prize in 1993 and gave his Nobel Lecture concerning his invention of the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) method, he gratefully acknowledged Biosearch and Dr. Cook's role in providing him one of the first SAM I DNA synthesizers which was used in support of Kary Mullis' PCR research.&lt;ref&gt;Kary B. Mullis' Nobel Lecture, December 8, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2566">For typical three-dimensional metals, the [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity#Temperature dependence|temperature-dependence of the electrical resistivity]] ''ρ(T)'' due to the scattering of electrons by acoustic [[phonon]]s changes from a high-temperature regime in which ''ρ ∝ T'' to a low-temperature regime in which ''ρ ∝ T&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'' at a characteristic temperature known as the [[Debye temperature]]. For low density electron systems, however, the [[Fermi surface]] can be substantially smaller than the size of the [[Brillouin zone]], and only a small fraction of acoustic phonons can scatter off electrons.&lt;ref&gt;M.S. Fuhrer, "Textbook physics from a cutting-edge material," ''Physics'' '''3''', 106 (2010) {{doi|10.1103/Physics.3.106}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in a new characteristic temperature known as the '''Bloch–Grüneisen temperature''' that is lower than the Debye temperature. The Bloch–Grüneisen temperature is defined as ''2ħv&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;/k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''ħ'' is the [[Planck constant]], ''v&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the velocity of sound, ''ħk&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Fermi momentum]], and ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]].

When the temperature is lower than the Bloch–Grüneisen temperature, the most energetic thermal phonons have a typical momentum of ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T/v&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' which is smaller than ''ħk&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;'', the momentum of the conducting electrons at the [[Fermi surface]]. This means that the electrons will only scatter in small angles when they absorb or emit a phonon.
In contrast when the temperature is higher than the Bloch–Grüneisen temperature, there are thermal phonons of all momenta and in this case electrons will also experience large angle scattering events when they absorb or emit a phonon.

The Bloch–Grüneisen temperature has been observed experimentally in a [[two-dimensional electron gas]]&lt;ref&gt;H. L. Stormer, L. N. Pfeiffer, K. W. Baldwin, and K. W. West, "Observation of a Bloch–Grüneisen regime in two-dimensional electron transport," ''Phys. Rev. B'' '''41''', 1278–1281 (1990), {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevB.41.1278}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[graphene]].&lt;ref&gt;D.K. Efetov and P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5964">The '''CTX''' ('''C'''omputer '''T'''omography '''X'''-ray) is an explosive detection device, a family of [[X-ray machine|x-ray]] devices developed by [[InVision Technologies]] in 1990 that uses [[CAT scan]]s and sophisticated [[image processing]] software to automatically screen checked baggage for explosives.

==CTX-5000==
In 1994, the CTX-5000 became the first [[computed tomography]] explosive detection system certified by the [[US Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA). The certification of the CTX-5000 followed nine years of development. During that time the FAA invested $90 million in explosives detection and nearly $8.6 million in the specific technology. From 1995 to 1997, the CTX-5000 was tested to solve the challenges involved in integrating an explosives detection system into a baggage system and to validate the estimated costs of wide-scale deployment of the systems.

==CTX-5000 SP==
The CTX-5000 SP scanning system, an improved version of the CTX-5000 for checked baggage, was delivered to the FAA in 1997 and placed at several of the US's busiest and largest airports. From 1997 to 2000, more than 100 of the systems have been purchased by the FAA to install in US airports, according to [[InVision Technologies|InVision]].

==CTX-5500DS==
The CTX-5500DS is an automated explosives detection system that uses computed tomography to characterize materials in checked bags and automatically identify objects that could be [[improvised explosive device]]s. The CTX-5500DS is the most widely used, FAA-certified Explosives Detection System in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/ids/airport_security/equipment.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427033843/http://www.boeing.com/ids/airport_security/equipment.html |archivedate=2006-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used for either standalone applications or in an integrated manner with airport baggage handling systems. It can also be configured to detect other types of contraband material. The CTX-5500DS has an FAA-certified throughput of 384 bags per hour. Its Dynamic Screening (DS) capability offers flexibility by allowing manual or automatic switching between various screening modes.

==CTX-2500==
The CTX-2500 is a small-sized explosives detection system that is half the length of earlier CTX models. The CTX 2500 utilizes a single rotating X-ray source to acquire positioning images and CT-slice images, thus achieving its smaller size. The CTX 2500 system is the first FAA-certified Explosives Detection System (EDS) mounted on a truck for easy mobility and access to cargo. One of the units costs approximately US$700,000.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==CTX-9000==
The CTX-9000 DSi system is the world's fastest FAA-certified (Certification moved to TSA Transportation Security Lab in 2002) Explosives Detection System, handling 542 bags per hour. It features alternate operational modes yielding even higher throughputs. The CTX-9000 DSi is designed for integrated airport installations. Its 1-metre wide conveyor coordinates with standard airport baggage handling systems. The system's architecture utilizes modular components, helping to ease scanner upgrading and servicing. The scanner contains 4 active radiation-shielding curtains. In addition, the gantry rotates at 120 RPM, enabling a slice image to be generated within half a second. A high-speed [[Radio frequency|RF]] data link connects the rotating gantry to the stationary part of the unit. An air-conditioning unit ensures high performance and reliability in hot, dusty and humid airport environments.

==Competition==
In the late 1990s, [[L-3 Communications]] developed a competing computerized tomography system that also met FAA approval, however it was not TSA Qualified until late 2002. In November 1999, the FAA awarded a contract worth up to US$75 million to [[L-3 Communications|L-3]] to purchase up to 60 of its explosive detection systems. The [[eXaminer]] [[eXaminer 3DX 6000|3DX 6000]] explosive detection system developed by [[L-3 Communications|L-3]] operates similarly to the CTX system.

==Recent Developments==
Recent research has evaluated the use of [[computer vision]] based algorithms that operate on the volumetric data used collected as CT-slice images by these and other manufacturers [[computed tomography]] (CT) baggage scanner machines for the automatic detection of other threat types (e.g. guns, knives, liquid containers) using 3D object classification.&lt;ref name="megherbi10baggage"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Megherbi, N. |author2=Flitton, G.T. |author3=Breckon, T.P. | chapter=A Classifier based Approach for the Detection of Potential Threats in CT based Baggage Screening| title=Proc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2506">The '''calculated carbon aromaticity index''' (CCAI) is an index of the ignition quality of residual fuel oil.

The running of all [[internal combustion engines]] is dependent on the ignition quality of the fuel. For [[spark-ignition]] engines the fuel has an [[octane rating]]. For [[diesel engine]]s it depends on the type of fuel, for distillate fuels the [[cetane number]]s are used. Cetane numbers are tested using a special test engine and the existing engine was not made for residual fuels. For residual fuel oil two other empirical indexes are used: CCAI and [[Calculated Ignition Index]] (CII). Both CCAI and CII are calculated from the [[density]] and [[viscosity|kinematic viscosity]] of the fuel.

==Definition==
Formula for CCAI:

&lt;math&gt;CCAI=D-140.7 \log (\log (V+0.85))-80.6-210 \ln \left (\frac{t+273}{323} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to:

&lt;math&gt;CCAI=D-140.7 \log (\log (V+0.85))-80.6-483.5 \log \left (\frac{t+273}{323} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Where:&lt;br/&gt;
D= density at 15°C (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;
V= viscosity (cST)&lt;br/&gt;
t = viscosity temperature (°C)

==Use==
This will normally give a value somewhere between 800 and 880. The lower the value is the better the ignition quality. Fuels with a CCAI higher than 880 are often problematic or even unusable in a diesel engine. CCAI are often calculated under testing of marine fuel.
In case of high CCAI, the manufacturers recommendations and guidance limits should be consulted to ensure that the fuel falls within the permissible range for the engine type. Attention should be given to the combustion profile, peak pressures and exhaust temperatures on the Engine.

As the name suggests, CCAI is a calculation based on the density and viscosity of a given fuel. The
formula is rather complex but in general, the higher the CCAI, the poorer the ignition quality of the fuel
is considered to be. Once the CCAI goes above 860, it is an indication that some combustion problems
may occur.

Studies carried out by engine manufacturers indicate that combustion related problems caused by fuels with
high CCAI can be reduced by avoiding running the engine at part load. It is therefore suggested that
wherever possible, the engine load should be maintained above 50% and the chief engineer should listen
for indications of poor combustion (i.e. knocking). Should any such problems be noted then it is
recommended that an alternative fuel is used whilst further investigations are carried out on samples from this fuel

The '''Calutron Girls''' were a group of young women, mostly high school graduates who joined the [[World War II]] efforts in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="Freeman2015"/&gt;

Although they were not allowed to know at the time, they were monitoring dials and watching meters for a [[calutron]], a [[mass spectrometer]] that separates [[uranium isotopes]].&lt;ref name="Fanning2014"/&gt; The enriched uranium was used to make the first [[atomic bomb]].

Calutron Girls were trained and employed at the [[Y-12 National Security Complex]].&lt;ref name="Nickell2010"/&gt; Wartime labor shortages forced the Tennessee Eastman Corporation to hire women to work at the Y-12 plant.

According to Gladys Owens, one of the few Calutron Girls, a manager at the facility once told them: "We can train you how to do what is needed, but cannot tell you what you are doing. I can only tell you that if our enemies beat us to it, God have mercy on us!"

{{Climbing sidebar}}

'''Climbing protection''' is any of a variety of devices employed to reduce risk and protect others while [[climbing]] [[rock climbing|rock]] and [[ice climbing|ice]].&lt;ref name="freedom"&gt;{{cite book | edition = 7 | editor = Cox, Steven M. |editor2=Kris Fulsaas | title = [[Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills]] | publisher = The Mountaineers | isbn = 0-89886-828-9| location = Seattle | year = 2003–09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It includes such items as nylon [[webbing]] and metal [[nut (climbing)|nut]]s, [[Spring-loaded camming device|cams]], [[Bolt (climbing)|bolt]]s, and [[piton]]s.

Different forms of climbing draw on varying forms of protection and the systems that are created from its elements.

== Types of climbing ==

There are a number of ways to "protect" a climb, varying according to the type of climbing:

===Lead climbing===
{{main|Lead climbing}}
A lead climber places protection (temporary or permanent [[Anchor (climbing)|anchors]]) in the rock, snow, or ice establishing a climbing route. The rope is clipped through [[carabiners]] (often joined by a short length of webbing into a pair known as a [[quickdraw]]) which are in turn  connected to the protection. The [[belaying|belayer]] pays out rope during the ascent, and manually arrests the climber's fall by locking the rope, typically with some form of [[belay device]].

===Aid climbing===
{{main|Aid climbing}}
Aid climbing involves standing on or pulling oneself up via devices attached to fixed or placed protection is used to make upward progress. In contrast to free climbing protection, which can sustain the force of sometimes long falls, some aid protection is only designed to hold one's body weight.

===Top roping===
{{main|Top roping}}
Top roping involves either placing an anchor at the top of a route before climbing or utilizing a fixed one, then running a rope through it to a belayer on the ground.  Unlike in lead climbing, the belayer takes in rope as the climber advances and slack is practically eliminated from the rope, minimizing both the drop and shock load on the rope and protection system should the climber fall.

===Soloing===
{{main|Solo climbing}}
Solo climbing involves climbing without a partner. Soloing can be done with or without protection. A solo climber may place protection and clip in with a short tether for safety during a difficult move, then remove the protection and continue the ascent.  Or they may employ some form of [[self-locking device]], such as a [[self-locking device#Silent Partner|Silent Partner]], in lieu of a belayer, allowing a soloist to climb without a partner. Additionally, soloing can also be done using a top rope.

===Bouldering===
{{main|Bouldering}}
Bouldering involves climbing routes low to the ground without rope.  The chief form of protection from injury used is a [[bouldering mat]], a padded foam-cell mat placed on the ground below a climber. In bouldering, one can also utilize a "spotter". A spotter is someone who stands near the bouldering mat and guides the climber to the mat in the event of a fall.

== Equipment ==
{{main|Climbing equipment}}
[[File:Climing anchor.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Anchor (climbing)|climbing anchor]], incorporating a [[Hexcentric|hex]], and two [[Spring-loaded camming device|cams]], linked and equalized with [[Sling (climbing equipment)|slings]] and [[carabiner]]s.]]

The gear used to protect climbs includes:
* [[Sling (climbing equipment)|Slings]] are loops of [[nylon]] [[webbing]] (also called "tape"), cord, [[Dyneema]], or [[Kernmantle rope#Use as climbing rope|rope]].  They can be tied around natural features such as rock spikes or trees, threaded through natural holes in the rock, round natural [[chockstones]], or through artificial anchors such as metal hangers, chains, or rings.  Also known as ''runners'', they are used to temporarily attach a climber's [[climbing harness|harness]] directly to an anchor. They can also be used to extend other pieces of protection to avoid compromise due to rope drag.
* [[nut (climbing)|Nut]]s, chocks, or simple cams are metal devices placed in constrictions in cracks and attached to carabiners with wire or nylon slings.
* [[Tricam]]s, a nut/cam hybrid that can be placed as a nut or as a passive camming device
* [[Spring-loaded camming device]] (SLCDs) use multiple cams in opposition, which expand in a crack as the device is weighted.  These can be placed even in parallel and outward flaring cracks.
* [[Bolt (climbing)|Bolt]]s are anchors fixed in holes drilled in the rock and clipped by the climber with a carabiner. They are placed both by climbers putting up new routes, particularly in [[aid climbing]], and as permanent fixtures on popular routes to reduce wear on rock features.
* [[Piton]]s are metal spikes hammered or hand-placed in thin cracks and clipped through an eye in the piton to a carabiner.
* [[Skyhook (climbing)|Skyhook]]s are talon shaped hooks placed over very small ledges and flakes and secured to a carabiner. Usually found in [[aid climbing]], they are occasionally utilized in [[free climbing]] as extremely marginal protection.

'''''Fixed protection''''' usually consists of permanently anchored bolts fitted with hangers, a chain, and ring, or pitons left ''in situ''.

== Standards ==

There are two major standards for climbing equipment safety and reliability worldwide:
* [[Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme|UIAA (International Mountaineering and Climbing Federation)]]
* [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN (European Committee for Standardisation)]]

In recent years, the CEN has become an important standards organization, mainly in Europe since any products sold in Europe must by law be third-party certified to the relevant standards.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  There is no such requirement in most other countries, although most manufacturers voluntarily follow UIAA or CEN standards (much like electrical equipment in the US is almost always privately certified by [[Underwriters Laboratories]]).

===CEN===
In [[Europe]], equipment used by climbers has to meet the requirements of the Personal and Protective Equipment (PPE) Directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barnes|first1=Samuel|title=How a product complies with EU safety, health and environmental requirements, and how to place a CE marking on your product.|url=https://www.gov.uk/ce-marking|website=gov.uk|publisher=Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- EU Parliament reference anyone? --&gt;  Essentially, the equipment must be manufactured using a carefully controlled process and samples must pass various tests.  Equipment meeting the regulations is marked with the [[CE Mark]].  Various standards are used to specify how equipment is to be tested:

* EN 12270:1998 "Mountaineering equipment. Chocks. Safety requirements and test methods."
* EN 892:1997 "Mountaineering equipment. Dynamic Mountaineering ropes. Safety requirements and test methods"
* EN 12276:1999 "Mountaineering equipment. Frictional anchors. Safety requirements and test methods" (covers SLCDs)

There are many more, most of them appearing in [[ICS code]] 97.220.40 and having "Mountaineering" in the title.

===UIAA===
The UIAA Safety Commission develops and maintains safety standards for climbing equipment. These standards are implemented world-wide by the manufacturers who also participate in annual Safety Commission meetings. The Commission works with nearly 60 manufacturers world-wide and has 1861 products certified.

In the mid-nineties, CEN adopted the UIAA Safety Standards. Both commissions in CEN and UIAA share similar members.

'''Controlled traffic farming''' ('''CTF''') is a management tool which is used to reduce the [[soil degradation|damage to soil]]s caused by heavy or repeated [[agricultural machinery]] passes on the land. This damage and its negative consequences have been well documented and include increased [[fuel use]], poor [[seedbed]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.dpi.qld.gov.au/fieldcrops/3166.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724222656/http://www2.dpi.qld.gov.au/fieldcrops/3166.html |archivedate=2010-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; reduced [[crop yield]]s and poor soil function in terms of water infiltration, [[drainage]] and [[greenhouse gas]] mitigation due to [[soil compaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Controlled traffic farming is a system which confines all machinery loads to the least possible area of permanent [[traffic lane]]s. Current farming systems allow machines to run at random over the land, [[soil compaction|compacting]] around 75% of the area within one season and at least the whole area by the second season. Soils don’t recover quickly, taking as much as a few years (e.g., &gt;5 years, particularly in soils without swelling-shrinking properties).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Radford |first1=B.J. |last2=Yule |first2=D.F. |last3=McGarry |first3=D. |last4=Playford |first4=C. |title=Amelioration of soil compaction can take 5 years on a Vertisol under no till in the semi-arid subtropics |journal=Soil and Tillage Research |date=December 2007 |volume=97 |issue=2 |pages=249–255 |doi=10.1016/j.still.2006.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McHugh |first1=A.D. |last2=Tullberg |first2=J.N. |last3=Freebairn |first3=D.M. |title=Controlled traffic farming restores soil structure |journal=Soil and Tillage Research |date=June 2009 |volume=104 |issue=1 |pages=164–172 |doi=10.1016/j.still.2008.10.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The potential of controlled traffic farming to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and enhance carbon sequestration in arable land: a critical review |journal=Transactions of the ASABE |date=22 June 2015 |pages=707–731 |doi=10.13031/trans.58.11049}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proper CTF system on the other hand can reduce tracking to just 15% and this is always in the same place. CTF is a tool; it does not include a prescription for [[tillage]] although most growers adopting CTF use little or none because [[soil structure]] does not need to be repaired. The permanent traffic lanes are normally parallel to each other and this is the most efficient way of achieving CTF, but the definition does not preclude tracking at an angle. The permanent traffic lanes may be cropped or non-cropped depending on a wide range of variables and local constraints.

==Achieving controlled traffic farming==
Controlled traffic farming can be achieved on any scale but to get tracked areas to the minimum possible, there are three requirements:
* To match implement widths so that adjacent passes are in the same place for all machines working in the field.
* To match the track widths (the distance between wheel centres on the same [[axle]]) of all field machinery.
* To keep machines in exactly the same place year in year out.

Matching implement widths is a case of [[forward planning]], or making sure that if anything doesn’t match now, its replacement will. It’s also the case that the wider the implements are, the less will be the tracked area. Growers often find they can use wider machines because without soil damage, they are easier to pull and in the case of [[cultivator]]s, most likely don’t need to work anywhere near as deep.

Matching track widths is more difficult because grain [[Combine harvester|harvester]]s often come with a track of 3 m or more and matching to these would make all machines very wide and often impractical to use on a daily basis. Matching to the harvester track works well in [[Australia]] where properties are often remote, there is plenty of space and road travel may not be too extensive. In other parts to the world, including most of Europe, alternatives have been found. These may not be quite as efficient in minimising the tracked area, but achieving less than 20% is still perfectly feasible. 

In controlled traffic farming systems for [[vegetable]] cropping, track widths vary between 1.83 m (the 72” imperial standard) to customised systems of perhaps 3.2 m or more. [[Road transport]] with these wide systems can be difficult but their use in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Denmark]] is increasing and growers accept the constraints because of the advantages that the systems bring.

Keeping machines in exactly the same place is most easily achieved with a satellite guidance system based on an RTK correction signal and auto-steer. Only the RTK system can guarantee to keep vehicles in the same place year in year out and it also achieves the highest pass to pass accuracy of around ± 2&amp;nbsp;cm. 
Guidance systems have many other advantages and once a system of this nature has been adopted, the natural progression is to move to controlled traffic farming. 

The generic advantages of guidance include much reduced overlap between passes of machines, particularly of wide cultivators which may overlap by around 10%. Although planters and [[drill]]s use physical markers to match up between one pass and the next, cumulative errors can be large and non-cropped tracks created by these machines (tramlines) for chemical applications can often have an overlap of 5%. The implications of this are significant because tramlines are used for all chemical applications. A 5% overlap wastes the equivalent in increasingly expensive materials and through overdosing, damages crops and could lead to extra run-off and diffuse pollution.

==Advantages==
The main advantages are:
*improved crop yields, particularly in seasons with extreme dry or wet
*lower inputs for crop establishment, which:
**reduce fuel use
**reduce power demand meaning smaller [[tractor]]s to do the same job
**improve timeliness of operations
*better [[soil health]] and function, which:
**improves soil porosity meaning there is more space for water and air;
**improves water infiltration which reduces the potential for [[soil erosion]] and increases water availability to the crop;
**improves drainage which avoids waterlogging and the potential for [[nitrous oxide]] and [[methane emissions]] and methane oxidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

*improves field access, particularly when soil moisture is high. Field operations are often needed in less than ideal conditions and when carried out, can cause extensive damage. Controlled traffic farming provides a firmer base for these operations (the permanent tracks) and constrains the damage to narrow strips.

==Disadvantages==
More discipline is required in the field, and can increase journey times when removing large volumes of material, such as sugar beet or potatoes.

There is greater reliance on technology in the form of satellite guidance and auto-steer. If a machine is in a state of disrepair, an exact replacement with a matching track or implement width may not be available.

The cutting width of grain harvesters for example, seldom match up to cultivator or drill widths. More demand and time could solve this issue.

Once a field has been laid out with a controlled traffic farming system, it is not advantageous to change it. However, it is not impossible because only around 20% of the field may be compacted and the position of these strips is known.

==Future==
Although controlled traffic farming is still in its infancy as far as adoption is concerned (partially because the enabling technology of satellite guidance is still relatively new), there is a better engineering solution that would reduce tracked areas to less than 10%. This is not a recent concept, having been pioneered by Alexander Halkett in the 1850s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The concept is described in detail at controlled traffic farming Europe's wide span page&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.controlledtrafficfarming.com/content/widespan.aspx CTF Europe's wide span page]&lt;/ref&gt; and achieves the low tracked area by virtue of using one of the same wheel tracks on adjacent passes. The system also reduces reliance on [[Global Positioning System|satellite technology]] because a guiding wheel track for the next pass is automatically laid down. With implements mostly contained within its wheel track, part width operations, for example ploughing or root crop harvesting, are perfectly feasible, whereas with existing tractor systems they are not.

In broadcast television, '''cord-cutting''' refers to the pattern of viewers, referred to as '''cord-cutters''', cancelling their subscriptions to [[multichannel video programming distributor|multichannel subscription television]] services available over cable, dropping [[pay television]] channels or reducing the number of hours of subscription TV viewed in response to competition from rival media available over the [[Internet]] such as [[Amazon Prime]], [[Sling TV]], [[Crunchyroll]], [[Hulu]], [[Netflix]] and [[YouTube Premium]]. This Internet content is either free or significantly cheaper than the same content provided via cable.

As a market trend, a growing number of "cord cutters" do not pay for subscription television in favour of some combination of [[Internet access#Broadband access|broadband Internet]] and [[IPTV]], [[digital video recorder]]s, [[digital terrestrial television]] and/or [[free-to-air]] [[satellite television]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/amadoudiallo/2013/10/16/how-to-cut-the-cord-cable-tv/|title=Ready To Cut The Cable TV Cord? Here's How To Do It|author=Amadou Diallo|date=16 October 2013|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; broadcasts. A related group, the '''cord-nevers''', have never used commercial cable for television service, relying on internet sources from the start. A number of purely internet television services, part of the wider [[IPTV]] concept, have emerged to cater to these groups.

==Market impact==
Parks Associates estimated that in 2008, about 0.9 million American households relied entirely on the Internet for television viewing; by 2017, this figure had increased to 22.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fry|first=Erika|date=February 1, 2018|title=Super Bowl Ads Can't Save TV|url=&lt;!--citation is of a print article--&gt;|journal=Fortune|type=print mail distribution|volume=|pages=pg. 11|issn=0015-8259|quote=The ranks of cord cutters reached 22.2 million in 2017, a 33.2% increase from the yer before, according to eMarketer.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leichtman Research Group found that six percent of Americans watched at least one show online each week in 2008, a figure that grew to eight percent in 2009. The number of Americans subscribing to cable service increased two percent in 2008, but the growth had slowed. [[Sanford Bernstein|Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.]] found that in the fourth quarter of 2008, the increase was seven-tenths of one percent, or 220,000 homes, the lowest ever recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124347195274260829|title=More Households Cut the Cord on Cable|last=Lawton|first=Christopher|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=2009-05-28|accessdate=2011-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Centris report showed that 8% of Americans expected to cancel their pay television service by the third quarter of 2009. About half of Americans tried to get a better deal from a provider other than the one they were subscribed to. [[Amazon Video]], [[Hulu]], [[iTunes]], [[Netflix]], [[Sling TV]] and [[YouTube]], made cancelling service possible for those who would be unable to see their favorite programs over the air. Sports programming was a big reason for not cancelling pay television service, although online options existed for many events. Another problem was the inability to watch many programs live, or at least soon enough in the case of a television series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2010/01/your-guide-to-cutting-the-cord-to-cable-tv008.html|title=Your Guide to Cutting the Cord to Cable TV|last=Glaser|first=Mark|publisher=[[PBS]]|date=2010-01-08|accessdate=2011-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2010 was the first year that pay television saw quarterly subscriber declines. In the second quarter of 2012, Sanford Bernstein determined that losses took place in five quarters.&lt;ref name=Yahoo/&gt; Leichtman found that the decrease in pay subscriptions was not happening in large numbers. One reason was that some sports events, as well as other types of television (such as series airing on cable-originated networks), could not be seen online. Sanford Bernstein said the number of pay television subscribers increased by 677,000 during the first quarter of 2010, and a poll conducted by ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[CBS News]] showed that 88% of people surveyed had such a service, and only 15% had considered going exclusively to web services. People under the age of 45, the survey said, were four times more likely to use the Internet only. To combat the trend, pay television providers were allowing people to stream television programs on [[desktop computer|desktop]], [[laptop]] and [[tablet computer]]s. Craig Moffett of Sanford C. Bernstein still stated that high prices and other methods would eventually drive customers away, calling cord cutting "perhaps the most overhyped and overanticipated phenomenon in tech history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/business/media/23couch.html?_r=1&amp;ref=sofa_wars|title=In the Living Room, Hooked on Pay TV|last1=Richtel|last2=Stelter|first1=Matt|first2=Brian|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2010-08-23|accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comcast reported a loss of 275,000 subscribers in the third quarter of 2010, bringing the total for the calendar year to 625,000. The company said most of these losses were not from people leaving for another service. Moffett pointed out that cable companies needed to offer lower-cost packages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/28/business/media/28comcast.html?_r=1&amp;ref=media/|title=Comcast Loses More Subscribers Than Expected, but Its Earnings Top Estimates|last=Arango|first=Tim|work=The New York Times|date=2010-10-27|accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a survey by Strategy Analytics revealed financial considerations were not the primary reason. People were not satisfied with what they could get, and online sources had a wider array of content. The survey showed that 13% of cable subscribers intended to cancel service in the next year. Slightly more than half were under the age of 40, and nearly all had a high school education. Two-thirds had or planned further schooling, and just over half earned at least $50,000 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gigaom.com/video/cord-cutters-are-young-educated-and-employed/|title=Cord Cutters Are Young, Educated and Employed |last=Lawler|first=Ryan|work=gigaom.com|date=2010-10-29|accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In second quarter 2011, Comcast lost 238,000 television customers, compared to 265,000 a year earlier, though the company was making up for these losses with increases in other services such as Internet. Moffett said the slowing rate indicated that online sources were not making people drop cable as quickly. On the other hand, Time Warner Cable and [[Charter Communications]] lost more customers in the quarter than in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-03/comcast-second-quarter-profit-advances-16-as-video-subscriber-losses-slow.html|title=Comcast Second-Quarter Profit Advances 16% as Video-Subscriber Losses Slow|last=Sherman|first=Alex|work=Bloomberg|date=2011-08-03|accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Time Warner Cable lost 130,000, while [[Dish Network]] lost 135,000; by comparison, [[DirecTV]] gained 26,000 subscribers, compared to 100,000 the previous year. [[Nielsen Media Research]] estimated that the number of households with at least one television set had decreased from 115.9 million to 114.7 million, while also estimating an increase in program viewing by computer, tablets or [[smartphone]]s. Services such as [[U-verse]] were increasing their subscriber numbers by offering special features: U-verse's "My Multiview" option allowed people to watch four channels at once, while [[Cablevision]]'s "iO TV Quick Views" allowed the display of up to nine channels at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/465621-Cablevision_Tiles_Up_To_Nine_Favorite_Channels_On_One_Screen.php|title=Cablevision Tiles Up To Nine Favorite Channels On One Screen|last=Spangler|first=Todd|work=[[Multichannel News]]|date=2011-03-20|accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Nielsen report showed that during the fourth quarter of 2011, the number of people paying for television had dropped by 15 million people (a rate of 1.5 percent), and the number of cable subscribers dropped by 2.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/05/nielsen-cable-loses-2-9m-subscribers-as-1-5m-u-s-households-cut-cord-in-2011/#more-267092|title=Nielsen: Cable Loses 2.9M Subscribers As 1.5M U.S. Households Cut Cord In 2011|publisher=deadline.com|date=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 [[Deloitte]] report said 9% of television households dropped cable service during 2011 and an additional 11% planned to cancel their service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/06/24/2153676/why-your-cable-tv-bill-will-never.html|title=Why your cable TV bill will never get cheaper|last=Fottrell|first=Quentin|work=[[News &amp; Observer]]|date=2012-06-24|accessdate=2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanford Bernstein estimates 400,000 dropped pay video services during the second quarter of 2012, up from 340,000 in 2011. One reason for the drop was college students' returning home for the summer, while the companies made up for the loss in other quarters. However, the number of new homes paying for television service is less than the total number of new homes.&lt;ref name=Yahoo&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443792604577574901875760374?mod=djemMM_t |title=Evidence Grows on TV Cord-Cutting|last=Ramachandran|first=Shalini|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=2012-08-15|accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible reason is services, such as [[time shifting]] and live recording capabilities, that were once exclusive to pay television services, are now being offered to cord cutters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/2300-17742_7-10019233-19.html|title=Most anticipated tech of 2014 (pictures)|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the number of subscribers usually increases in the third quarter, in 2012 only 30,000 people added pay television service, according to a study by the International Strategy &amp; Investment Group. Cable lost 340,000 subscribers (with Time Warner Cable accounting for 140,000 of that number) and satellite gained only 50,000; telephone companies added 320 subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TV Execs Are Bullish on Q4|last=Lafayette|first=Jon|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout 2012, pay television added only 46,000 new subscribers, out of 974,000 new households overall, according to [[SNL Kagan]]. 84.7 percent of households subscribed, compared to 87.3 percent in early 2010.&lt;ref name=Nakashima/&gt;

Another category of cord-cutters was labeled by Nielsen in March 2013 as "Zero TV". In 2007, two million households had neither subscribed to a pay television service or received television programming via antenna. By 2013, this number had increased to five million. Most people in this category were younger and did not have children in the household. People could still view shows via online streaming through services such as [[Netflix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/vrichard/10-ways-to-cut-the-cord-on-cable-tv-in-2016-29811|title=10 ways to cut the cord on Cable TV in 2016|last=|first=|date=March 2016|website=Buzzfeed|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2013 [[National Association of Broadcasters]] Show, the solution for broadcasters was stated to be [[mobile television]].&lt;ref name=Nakashima/&gt; A 2013 Leichtman survey showed that the 13 largest MVPD companies, covering 94 percent of the country, experienced their first year-to-year subscriber losses. 80,000 subscribers dropped their service in the year ending March 31, 2013. 1.5 million cable customers dropped their service, with Time Warner Cable losing 553,000 and Comcast losing 359,000 subscribers. AT&amp;T and Verizon added 1.32 million subscribers; DirecTV and Dish added 160,000 subscribers, compared to 439,000 the previous year. Before 2013, only quarter-to-quarter losses had been recorded industrywide. Internet video and switching to receiving television programming by antenna were reasons. Bruce Leichtman described the subscription television industry as "saturated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/cord-cutting-at-last-hard-evidence-its-really-happening-1200484321/|title=Cord-Cutting: At Last, Hard Evidence It’s Really Happening|first=Todd|last=Spangler|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2013-05-20|accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A TDG study showed nearly 101 million U.S. households subscribed to television at the industry's peak in 2011, but the number would fall below 95 million in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paidcontent.org/2013/01/11/pay-tv-will-shrink-for-first-time-in-history-study-says-cable-watching-peaked-in-2012/|title=Pay TV will shrink for first time in history, study says cable watching peaked in 2011|author=Jeff John Roberts|date=2013-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the number of total subscribers to pay TV services fell by a quarter of a million.

In Q1 2017 the pay TV industry experience subscriber loss that was five times greater than Q1 of 2016. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cutthecord.com/press-release-cord-cutters-coup-detat/|title=Press Release: The Cord-Cutters Coup d'état - CutTheCord.com|date=2017-05-25|work=Cut The Cord|access-date=2017-09-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Statisica survey in 2015, 31.64% of people who [https://www.cutthecord.com cut the cord] said they did so because of price increase.

Some broadcasters have elected to embrace the concept of cord-cutting by establishing subscription-based over-the-top content offerings of their own, such as [[HBO Now]].&lt;ref name=verge-hbonowhandson&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/7/8363811/hbo-now-apple-tv-hands-on|title=HBO Now on Apple TV Hands On|accessdate=April 7, 2015|work=The Verge|date=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-15/how-hbos-new-streaming-service-shakes-up-cable-tv|title=How HBO's New Streaming Service Shakes Up the Cable-TV Business|last=Brustein|first=Joshua|work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek|date=2014-10-15|accessdate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the 2014 launch of [[CBS All Access]], [[Les Moonves]] stated that there was a "very strong possibility" [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] would also offer an OTT service—a plan which would be realized in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CBS Sets July Launch, $11 Monthly Fee For Showtime OTT Service|url=https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/cbs-showtime-ott-apple-tv-1201511351/|author=Cynthia Littleton|website=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=June 3, 2015|accessdate=July 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leslie Moonves Divulges Details on Showtime’s New Online Streaming Service|url=https://variety.com/2015/biz/news/leslie-moonves-showtime-cbs-ott-1201511637/|author=Cynthia Littleton|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=June 3, 2015|accessdate=July 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2014/digital/news/hbo-streaming-cbs-all-access-1201335778/|title=With HBO and CBS Cutting the Cord, Which Networks Will Follow Suit?|last=Spangler|first=Todd|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2014-10-22|accessdate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 31, 2016, Canadian sports channel [[Sportsnet]] (owned by media and telecom conglomerate [[Rogers Communications]]) announced an OTT service offering its four regional feeds and two main national channels.&lt;ref name="cbcnews-snnowott"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rogers to offer all Sportsnet content in streaming service|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/rogers-streaming-sportsnet-1.3514513|website=CBC News|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Cord-nevers"===
On November 28, 2011, a report by [[Credit Suisse]] media analyst Stefan Anninger said that young people who grew up accustomed to watching shows online would be less likely to subscribe to pay television services, terming these people as "cord-nevers". Anninger predicted that by the end of 2012, the industry's subscriber count would drop by 200,000 to 100.5 million; Anninger's report also stated that consumers were not likely to return to paying for television. In the case of [[Landline|land-line telephones]], people had believed younger people would eventually get them, but now numerous subscribers only have [[mobile phone]]s. Anninger predicted that the same would hold true for pay television, and that providers would need to offer lower-priced packages with fewer channels in order to reverse the trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/11/analyst-warns-of-bleak-outlook-for-cable-industry.html|title=Analyst warns of bleak outlook for cable industry|last=Flint|first=Joe|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2011-11-28|accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also using the term "cord-nevers" was Richard Schneider, whose company Antennas Direct was selling antennas through the Internet. After a decade in business, the company was selling 600,000 antennas a year. However, Schneider said some people only knew of the Internet and services such as [[Netflix]] and were not even aware broadcast television even existed.&lt;ref name=Nakashima&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10735794 |title=Broadcasters worry about 'Zero TV' homes|last=Nakashima|first=Ryan|work=[[Associated Press]]|date=2013-04-07|accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech on November 16, 2012, [[Time Warner]] CEO [[Jeff Bewkes]] said "cord nevers" did not see anything worth paying for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paidcontent.org/2012/11/16/time-warner-ceo-cord-cutters-not-an-issue-cord-nevers-might-be/|title=Time Warner CEO: Cord cutters not an issue, "cord nevers" might be|author=Jeff John Roberts|date=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cord shaving==
In 2013, specific channels were losing more subscribers than pay TV providers. This was because of what came to be known as "cord shaving", switching to a cheaper package of channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pay TV’s New Worry: ‘Shaving’ the Cord|last1=Hagey|first1=Keach|last2=Ramachandran|first2=Shalini|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=October 10, 2014|page=B1 (eastern edition)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadband-only TV products==
In an effort to entice cord cutters and cord nevers, some cable television providers have begun offering Internet-only streaming services. [[Cablevision]] began to offer "Cord Cutter" packages that include a free digital antenna and access to its Optimum WiFi network, as well as the option to add [[HBO Now]] to the service, making it the first ever cable provider to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Engadget|date=April 23, 2015|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/04/23/cablevision-cord-cutter/|author=Baldwin, Roberto|title=Cablevision offers 'Cord Cutter' packages with optional HBO Now}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Comcast]] and [[Time Warner Cable]] (TWC) began to trial television services delivered via their managed internet infrastructures; Comcast's "Stream" service offered access to broadcast networks, HBO, Xfinity StreamPix, and their respective TV Everywhere services. Outside of TVE apps, the service can only be accessed via Comcast home internet on supported devices.&lt;ref name="techhive-stream"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comcast’s new streaming service is not as terrible as you might think|url=http://www.techhive.com/article/2950499/streaming-services/comcasts-new-streaming-service-is-not-as-terrible-as-you-might-think.html|website=TechHive|publisher=IDG|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Engadget|date=July 12, 2015|title=Xfinity Internet Stream|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/07/12/comcast-xfinity-internet-stream/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, TWC began to trial a service under which subscribers are given a [[Roku]] 3 digital media player to access their service via the supplied TWC app, rather than a traditional set-top box. A TWC spokesperson emphasized that this offering would provide "the same TV and same packages delivered to the home today", but delivered over TWC-managed internet rather than a cable line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Time Warner Cable tests replacing your cable box with a Roku|author=Statt, Nick |date=November 9, 2015 |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/9/9700298/time-warner-cable-roku-cable-box-twc-tv|work=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Engadget|title=Time Warner Cable will test internet-only TV in NYC next week|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/10/23/time-warner-cable-internet-tv-beta-roku/|author=Lawler, Richard|date=October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Digital Trends|title=Time Warner Cable goes after cord cutters with new Internet TV service, free Roku|date=October 26, 2015 |author=Waniata, Ryan|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/comcast-launches-stream-internet-tv/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This service has since been transferred to the current [[Spectrum (cable service)|Spectrum]] service after Time Warner Cable's merger with [[Charter Communications|Charter]], with an equivalent [[Apple TV]] app forthcoming.

At the end of 2017, most new televisions had Internet capability. This contributed to the cord-cutting trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=OTT Fuels a Resurgence in Television Ads|last=Eason|first=Beth-Ann|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=November 6, 2017|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Cylinder Head Temperature gauge''' (CHT) measures the [[cylinder head]] [[temperature]] of an [[engine]]. Commonly used on air-cooled engines, the head temperature [[Gauge (instrument)|gauge]] displays the work that the engine is performing more quickly than an oil or water temperature gauge. As the [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] works at high speed or uphill, head temperature will increase quickly. The meter can be [[Voltmeter#Digital_voltmeter|digital]] or [[Voltmeter|analog]].

A [[air-cooled engine]] requires a steady flow of air for cooling. Unlike [[Radiator (engine cooling)|water cooled engine]], air cooled engines have no [[Thermostat#Mechanical_thermostats|thermostat]]. Over temperature can cause engine failure. Air-cooled engine are used in [[Aircraft engine controls|aircraft engine control]] and other [[air-cooled engine]]s as in cars and air-cooled [[motorcycle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ntsb.gov/about/employment/_layouts/ntsb.recsearch/Recommendation.aspx?Rec=A-12-007 National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Safety Recommendation A-12-007, Engine cylinder assemblies that fail]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CHT senders usually has a K-type [[thermocouple]] that is mounted under the spark plug. The [[Thermocouple#Type_K|K-type]] thermocouple is  pair of two dissimilar metals that produce a small voltage signal when heated. The metal closest to the spark plug is called the hot junction and the other close to the head cold junction. The ring under the spark plug is used to transfer the heat from the plug to the thermocouple. The gauge and cold junction are usually calibrated at room temperature  {{convert|72|F}}.  Because the thermocouple is calibrated for room temperature, the gauge readings will only be 100% accurate at that engine compartment temperature. If the engine compartment temperature is colder the CHT temperature will display higher. If the engine compartment temperature is higher the reading will be lower.  The error can be fixed with a cold-junction compensating [[thermistor]], which measures the temperature at the cold junction so the gauge can adjust the reading. Low budget gauges do not have this compensating thermistor.

'''Decapoint''', or ''raphigraphy'', was a tactile form of the [[Latin script]] invented by [[Louis Braille]] as a system that could be used by both the blind and sighted. It was published in 1839. Letters retained their linear form, and so were legible without training to the sighted, but the lines were composed of embossed dots like those used in [[braille]]. Each letter contained ten dots in the height and different dots in the width to produce the graphic form of print.

The reason for the development of this writing was that relatives of the students could not read braille.

These letters were not easy for the blind to write because of their height of ten dots despite grid. It therefore did not take long for the blind friend of Louis Braille [[Pierre-François-Victor Foucault]] in 1841 to build the first apparatus, the Raphigraph, which could push all the points of one column of characters at the same time into the paper. This font was now named '''[[:de:Raphigrafie|Raphigraphy]]''' (Raphigrafie or Raphigraphie).

When the first typewriters were invented, they repressed quickly the complicated Raphigraphy or decapoint, despite the impossibility for the blind to read the writing of typewriters. And so the Decapoint or Raphigraphy fell into oblivion, but it was the first digital font of Latin letters ever.

A '''decoupled debit card''' is a [[debit card]] in the US that is not issued by, and not tied to, any particular retail [[financial institution]], such as a [[bank]] or [[credit union]].  This is based on the ability in the US [[ACH Network]] payment system to make an electronic payment from any bank or credit union without needing to use a card issued by the bank or credit union.  A third party, such as a retailer, can create a decoupled debit card which will use this system to make a payment from the customer's [[checking account]].  They may do this as part of a [[Loyalty program|loyalty scheme]] or to reduce their own debit card processing costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eon.businesswire.com/news/eon/20120628006150/en/credit-cards/mobile-payments-debit-cards/mobile-wallet |title=Decoupled Debit is Alive and Well…in the Mobile Wallet |publisher=Enhanced Online News |date=June 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In May 2007, [[Capital One]] began a one-year decoupled [[debit card]] experiment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebankwatch.com/2007/06/04/capitalone-becomes-a-bank-with-checking-accounts/ CapitalOne becomes a Bank with checking accounts]&lt;/ref&gt; This card was novel in that prior to this launch, a debit card was always tied to a traditional financial institution. Capital One's [[MasterCard]]-branded decoupled card did not require an account be opened with a retail financial institution, and was made in partnership with the [[Ukrops]] grocery chain, based in Capital One's hometown of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Virginia]]. The card was also tied to a [[Loyalty program|reward program]] offered by Ukrops. The one-year experiment ended in May 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaltransactions.net/newsstory.cfm?newsid=1776 CapOne says its decoupled debit card pilots ended on schedule]&lt;/ref&gt; and was followed by a national rollout of its own version of a decoupled debit card tied to its own reward program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paymentindustryinsider.com/2008/07/decoupled-debit-card-lives-again/ Decoupled debit card lives again!]&lt;/ref&gt;

Decoupled Debit gained the attention of the financial services industry in May 2007 when Capital One announced they were going to add a decoupled debit card product. At the time Capital One did not offer checking accounts—only credit cards and this was a strategy to offer a debit card without actually owning the checking account relationship.  The one year pilot ended without Capital One citing specific reasons as why, leaving the industry with only speculation as to why.

Today, decoupled debit cards are typically issued and branded by retailers without any association to a national network such as Visa, MasterCard or Amex. The retailer has complete control over the issuing of the cards to their customers and the processing of the payment. By definition, decoupled debit cards are processed via the Federal Reserve ACH System as the mechanism for reaching a consumer’s checking account as a debit to their account for their purchase. The payment side of the product operates like an electronic check, but the product is more than just a payment card.

When the Durbin Amendment  became law in October 2011, there was new speculation that this was the end of decoupled debit. At the time there were only two main companies offering decoupled debit: Tempo and National Payment Card Association.  Tempo did in fact close their doors shortly after the roll-out of the Durbin Amendment—National Payment Card Association (NPCA) did not and is still thriving today in 2013.

Why one survived Durbin and the other did not is a function of their differences in business models and program structures. Tempo had a product model tied to Discover and accepted signature debit which resulted in a pricing model and risk profile that would no longer be attractive to retailers under Durbin.

National Payment Card Association  has a different pricing model – generally a fixed price per transaction of $.15 that retailers pay in processing fees, which is still very competitive even under Durbin regulation. The company also has a well articulated and easily understood value proposition for retailers:

Retailers reap swipe fee savings when they have a National Payment Card program when compared to what they pay in swipe fees for accepting Visa, MasterCard, AMEX, etc. The savings are used to fund rewards to the retailer’s customers which provides the incentive to the consumer to carry another payment card in their wallet.

The Target Red Card program is a great example of how the value proposition works. Consumers enroll with Target, provide their checking account to be debited and receive 5% discount at the register when they use the Red Card to pay. Target saves the fees they would have otherwise paid to the payment networks and banks and gives the savings back to their customers.

NPCA on the other hand has developed their niche in c-store petroleum.  The programs offer consumers an instant price rollback at the pump of anywhere between 3 cents and 10 cents off per gallon of fuel purchased. 
The programs offer another benefit to retailers and that is in building a customer data base. Since the consumer enrolls (generally online) into the program, the retailer gains baseline information about their cardholders (name, address, phone number, email addresses, etc.) and they gain the ability to track spending. This is information banks typically have when a customer uses a bank-issued payment card. Now the retailer has the information and can mine the data for use in targeted marketing to their customers.

On a going forward basis, the real payoff for decoupled debit might very well end up to be mobile payments.  The most noted program in this early life cycle of mobile payment using decoupled debit is Cumberland Farms SmartPay.    In this program, consumers can have a mobile payment app, a traditional mag stripe card, or both. The program tracks lifetime savings within the app and coupons and promotions can be delivered to the app while the Cumberland Farms customers are fueling.

In October 2013 payments technology firm [[Fidelity National Information Services|FIS]] announced a new private label, decoupled debit product called ''InterPayment''. InterPayment utilizes proprietary FIS technology and payment processing platforms.

{{Antennas|characteristics}}

In [[electromagnetism|electromagnetics]], '''directivity''' is a parameter of an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] or [[optical system]] which measures the degree to which the radiation emitted is concentrated in a single direction.  It measures the [[power density]] the antenna radiates in the direction of its strongest emission, versus the power density radiated by an ideal [[isotropic radiator]] (which emits uniformly in all directions) radiating the same total power.

An antenna's directivity is a component of its [[antenna gain|gain]]; the other component is its (electrical) [[antenna efficiency|efficiency]].  Directivity is an important measure because many antennas and optical systems are designed to radiate electromagnetic waves in a single direction or over a narrow angle.  Directivity is also defined for an antenna receiving electromagnetic waves, and its directivity when receiving is equal to its directivity when transmitting.

The directivity of an actual antenna can vary from 1.76 dBi for a [[dipole|short dipole]], to as much as 50 dBi for a large [[dish antenna]].&lt;ref name="antenna_tutorial"/&gt;

==Definition==

The ''directivity'', &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, of an antenna is the maximal value of its ''directive gain''. Directive gain is represented as &lt;math&gt;D(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;and compares the [[radiant intensity]] (power per unit [[solid angle]]) &lt;math&gt;U(\theta, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; that an antenna creates in a particular direction against the average value over all directions:

:&lt;math&gt;D(\theta,\phi) = \frac{U(\theta, \phi)}{P_\text{tot}/\left(4\pi\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; are the [[zenith angle]] and [[azimuth angle]] respectively in the standard [[spherical coordinate]] angles; &lt;math&gt;U(\theta, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[radiation intensity]], which is the power per unit solid angle; and &lt;math&gt;P_\text{tot}&lt;/math&gt;is the total radiated power. The quantities &lt;math&gt;U(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_\text{tot}&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the relation

:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{tot} = \int_{\phi=0}^{\phi=2\pi}\int_{\theta=0}^{\theta=\pi}U\sin\theta\,d\theta\,d\phi;&lt;/math&gt;
that is, the total radiated power &lt;math&gt;P_\text{tot}&lt;/math&gt; is the power per unit solid angle &lt;math&gt;U(\theta, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; integrated over a spherical surface. Since there are 4π [[steradians]] on the surface of a sphere, the quantity &lt;math&gt;P_\text{tot}/(4\pi)&lt;/math&gt; represents the ''average'' power per unit solid angle.

In other words, directive gain is the radiation intensity of an antenna at a particular &lt;math&gt;(\theta, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; coordinate combination divided by what the radiation intensity would have been had the antenna been an isotropic antenna radiating the same amount of total power into space.

''Directivity'', then, is the maximal directive gain value found among all possible solid angles:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 D &amp; = \max\left(\frac{U}{P_\text{tot}/\left(4\pi\right)}\right) \\
   &amp; = \frac{\left. U(\theta,\phi)\right|_\text{max}}{\frac{1}{4 \pi} \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^\pi U(\theta,\phi) \sin\theta \, d\theta\, d\phi}.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The word ''directivity'' is also sometimes used as a synonym for directive gain. This usage is readily understood, as the direction will be specified, or directional dependence implied. Later editions of the IEEE Dictionary&lt;ref name="IEEEdict1997"/&gt; specifically endorse this usage; nevertheless it has yet to be universally adopted.

== In antenna arrays ==
In an [[antenna array]] (a set of multiple identical [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] which work together as a single antenna), the directivity of the entire array is the multiplicative sum of the individual antenna's directivity function with a mathematical expression known as the '''array factor''' &lt;math&gt;AF&lt;/math&gt;, which typically depends on the location, the excitation and the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of each antenna element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engr.uky.edu/~cclu/EE522/NTS522_f.pdf|title=Array factors|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faculty.jacobs-university.de/jwallace/xwallace/courses/ap/ch5.pdf|title=Antennas and Propagation|publisher=Jacobs university|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall directivity function is given by

:&lt;math&gt;D_\text{array}(\theta, \phi) = \mathit{AF}\times D(\theta, \phi)&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt; D(\theta, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; is the directivity of a single element. This single element term is sometimes referred to as the ''element pattern''&lt;ref&gt;Electronically Scanned Arrays by Arik D. Brown&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Relation to beam width==

The beam [[solid angle]], represented as &lt;math&gt;\Omega_A&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as the solid angle which all power would flow through if the antenna radiation intensity were constant at its maximal value.  If the beam solid angle is known, then directivity can be calculated as

:&lt;math&gt;D = \frac{4\pi}{\Omega_A},&lt;/math&gt;

which simply calculates the ratio of the beam solid angle to the solid angle of a sphere.

The beam solid angle can be approximated for antennas with one narrow major lobe and very negligible minor lobes by simply multiplying the half-power [[beamwidth]]s (in radians) in two perpendicular planes.  The half-power beamwidth is simply the angle in which the radiation intensity is at least half of the peak radiation intensity.

The same calculations can be performed in degrees rather than in radians:

:&lt;math&gt;D \approx 4\pi\frac{(\frac{180}{\pi})^2}{\Theta_{1d}\Theta_{2d}} = \frac{41253}{\Theta_{1d}\Theta_{2d}},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Theta_{1d}&lt;/math&gt; is the half-power beamwidth in one plane (in degrees) and &lt;math&gt;\Theta_{2d}&lt;/math&gt; is the half-power beamwidth in a plane at a right angle to the other (in degrees).

In planar arrays, a better approximation is

:&lt;math&gt;D \approx \frac{32400}{\Theta_{1d}\Theta_{2d}}.&lt;/math&gt;
For an antenna with a ''conical'' (or approximately conical) beam with a half-power beamwidth of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; degrees, then elementary integral calculus yields an expression for the directivity as
:&lt;math&gt;D = \frac{2}{1 - cos\frac{\theta}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Expression in decibels==

The directivity is rarely expressed as the unitless number &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; but rather as a [[Decibel#Antenna measurements|decibel]] comparison to a reference antenna:

:&lt;math&gt;D_\text{dB} = 10 \cdot \log_{10}\left[\frac{D}{D_\text{reference}}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

The reference antenna is usually the theoretical perfect [[isotropic radiator]], which radiates uniformly in all directions and hence has a directivity of 1.  The calculation is therefore simplified to

:&lt;math&gt;D_\text{dBi} = 10 \cdot \log_{10} D.&lt;/math&gt;

Another common reference antenna is the theoretical perfect half-wave [[dipole]], which radiates perpendicular to itself with a directivity of 1.64:

:&lt;math&gt;D_\text{dBd} = 10 \cdot \log_{10}\left[\frac{D}{1.64}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

==Accounting for polarization==

When [[Polarization (antenna)|polarization]] is taken under consideration, three additional measures can be calculated:

===Partial directive gain===

'''Partial directive gain''' is the power density in a particular direction and ''for a particular component of the polarization'', divided by the average power density for all directions and ''all polarizations''. For any pair of orthogonal polarizations (such as left-hand-circular and right-hand-circular), the individual power densities simply add to give the total power density. Thus, if expressed as dimensionless ratios rather than in dB, the total directive gain is equal to the sum of the two partial directive gains.&lt;ref name="IEEEdict1997"/&gt;

===Partial directivity===

'''Partial directivity''' is calculated in the same manner as the partial directive gain, but without consideration of antenna efficiency (i.e. assuming a lossless antenna).  It is similarly additive for orthogonal polarizations.

===Partial gain===
{{main|Antenna gain}}
'''Partial gain''' is calculated in the same manner as gain, but considering only a certain polarization.  It is similarly additive for orthogonal polarizations.
==In other areas==
The term directivity is also used with other systems.

With [[directional coupler]]s, directivity is a measure of the difference in dB of the power output at a coupled port, when power is transmitted in the desired direction, to the power output at the same coupled port when the same amount of power is transmitted in the opposite direction.&lt;ref name="directional_coupler"/&gt;

In [[acoustics]], it is used as a measure of the radiation pattern from a source indicating how much of the total energy from the source is radiating in a particular direction. In electro-acoustics, these patterns commonly include omnidirectional, cardioid and hyper-cardioid microphone polar patterns. A loudspeaker with a high degree of directivity (narrow dispersion pattern) can be said to have a high ''Q''.&lt;ref name="rane_audio"/&gt;

A '''disability robot''' is a [[robot]] designed to help people who have physical [[disability|disabilities]] that impede with [[Activities of daily living|daily tasks]]. The field of expertise that creates such robots is called "disability robotics".

Disability robot has been proven to assist people who are recovering from strokes and people who have abstained injuries that effect their daily tasks. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sivan, Gallagher, Holt, Weightman, O'Connor, Levesley|first=Manoj, Justin, Ray, Andrew, Rory, Martin|date=6 February 2016|title=Employing the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health framework to capture user feedback in the design and testing stage of development of home-based arm rehabilitation technology|doi=10.1080/10400435.2016.1140689|journal=Assistive Technology|volume=28|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calabrò|first1=Rocco Salvatore|last2=Naro|first2=Antonino|last3=Leo|first3=Antonino|last4=Bramanti|first4=Placido|title=Usefulness of robotic gait training plus neuromodulation in chronic spinal cord injury: a case report|journal=The Journal of Spinal Cord Medicine|date=4 March 2016|pages=1–4|doi=10.1080/10790268.2016.1153275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vanoglio|first1=F.|last2=Bernocchi|first2=P.|last3=Mule|first3=C.|last4=Garofali|first4=F.|last5=Mora|first5=C.|last6=Taveggia|first6=G.|last7=Scalvini|first7=S.|last8=Luisa|first8=A.|title=Feasibility and efficacy of a robotic device for hand rehabilitation in hemiplegic stroke patients: A randomized pilot controlled study|journal=Clinical Rehabilitation|date=7 April 2016|doi=10.1177/0269215516642606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
In 1988 the National Institute of Disability and Rehabilitation Research, [[NIDRR]], awarded [[Gaulladet University]] a grant for the project “Robotic finger spelling hand for communication and access to text by deaf-blind persons.” Researchers at the University developed and tested a robotic hand. Although it was never commercialized the concept is relevant for current and future research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Robert J.|title=Rehabilitation robotics research at the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research|journal=The [[Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development]]|date=2006|volume=43|issue=5|pages=xvii|doi=10.1682/JRRD.2006.05.0041}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since this grant, many others have been written. [[NIDRR]] funded research appears to be moving from the fabrication of robotic arms that can be used by disabled persons to perform daily activities, to developing robotics that assist with therapy in the hopes of achieving long-term performance gains. If there is success in development of robotics, these mass-marketed products could assist tomorrow’s longer-living elderly individuals enough to postpone nursing home stays.&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Post Gazette"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gary|first=Rotstein|title=Robotic aids for the disabled and elderly|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/news/health/robotic-aids-for-the-disabled-and-elderly-510687/|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=9 April 2013|date=14 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Jim Osborn, executive director of the Quality of Life Technology Center, recently told a gathering of long-term care providers that if such advances could delay all nursing home admissions by a month, societal savings could be $1 billion monthly."&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Post Gazette"/&gt; Shortage of both paid personal assistants and available family members makes artificial assistance a necessity.

==Children==
Children with severe disabilities can develop [[learned helplessness]], which makes them lose interest in their environment. Robotic arms are used to provide an alternative method to engage in joint play activities.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, A., K. Howery, J. Gu, and M. Meng. 2000. "Robot enhanced interaction and learning for children with profound physical disabilities." Technology &amp; Disability 13, no. 1: 1. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed 9 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; These robotic arms allows children to manipulate real objects in the context of play activities.

==Gadgets==

Disability robotics is a broad category that includes [[wheelchairs]], robotic arms, and other robotic devices that assist disabled persons of all ability levels. This section will provide examples of the many types of robotic devices used to assist disabled persons.

===Wheelchair===

Persons with severe disabilities may be assisted with robotic wheelchairs when manual control is not possible. These devices can deter loss of residual skills and frustration. Traditionally wheelchairs either gave control to the person or robot depending on disability level.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Sandoval, et al. "Wheelchair Collaborative Control For Disabled Users Navigating Indoors." Artificial Intelligence In Medicine 52.3 (2011): 177-191. Academic Search Complete. Web. 9 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treadmill===
[[Bodyweight-supported treadmill training]] (BWSTT) are used to enhance walking ability of people with neurological injury. These machines are therapist-assisted devices that are used in the clinical setting, but is limited by the personnel and labor requirements placed on [[physical therapists]].&lt;ref name="BWSTT"&gt;Hornby, T. George, David H. Zemon, and Donielle Campbell. "Robotic-Assisted, Body-Weight–Supported Treadmill Training in Individuals Following Motor Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury." Physical Therapy 85, no. 1 (January 2005): 52-66. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed 9 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The BWSTT device, and many others like it, assist physical therapists by providing task-specific practice of walking in people following neurological injury.

The transponder gets its altitude information from an encoding altimeter mounted behind the instrument panel that communicates via the Gillham code.]]

'''Gillham code''' is a zero-padded 12-bit [[binary code]] using a parallel nine-&lt;ref name="Honeywell_2002"/&gt; to eleven-wire [[interface (computing)|interface]],&lt;ref name="Tooley-Wyatt_2009"/&gt; the '''Gillham interface''', that is used to transmit uncorrected [[Barometer|barometric]] [[altitude]] between an [[encoder|encoding]] [[altimeter]] or analog [[air data computer]] and a [[Digital data|digital]] [[Transponder (aviation)|transponder]]. It is a modified form of a [[Gray code]] and is sometimes referred to simply as a "Gray code" in [[avionics]] literature.&lt;ref name="Darryl_1998_MODEC"/&gt;

== History ==
The ''Gillham interface'' and ''code'' are an outgrowth of the 12-bit [[IFF Mark X]] system, which was introduced in the 1950s. The civil [[Transponder interrogation mode (aviation)|transponder interrogation mode]]s [[Mode A|A]] and [[Mode C|C]] were defined in [[air traffic control]] (ATC) and [[secondary surveillance radar]] (SSR) in 1960.&lt;!-- source needed! --&gt; The exact origin of the term ''Gillham code'' is unclear, but by 1962&lt;!-- not a specific date, just the earliest source using the term I could find so far. --&gt; the code was broadly recognized under this name&lt;ref name="CS_1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CE_1963"/&gt; and described in an [[FAA]] report.&lt;ref name="FAA_1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FI_1964"/&gt; By the mid-1960s the code was also known as ''MOA–Gillham code''&lt;ref name="Wheeler_1969"/&gt; or ''ICAO–Gillham code''. ''ARINC 572'' specified the code as well in 1968.&lt;ref name="ARINC_572"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ARINC_572-1"/&gt;

Once recommended by the [[ICAO]] for automatic height transmission for air traffic control purposes,&lt;ref name="FI_1964"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wightman_2017"/&gt; it is now discouraged&lt;ref name="Tooley-Wyatt_2009"/&gt; and has been mostly replaced by modern serial communication in newer aircraft.

== Altitude encoder ==
[[File:ACK A-30 Altitude Encoder 2.jpg|thumb|right|A typical altitude encoder, the ACK Technologies A-30. Note the 15-way D-type connector to send the Gillham code to the transponder and the port on the top of the case that connects to the aircraft's static pressure system.]]

An altitude encoder takes the form of a small metal box containing a [[pressure sensor]] and signal conditioning electronics.&lt;ref name="Ameriking_2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ACK Encoder"/&gt; The pressure sensor is often heated, which requires a warm-up time during which height information is either unavailable or inaccurate. Older style units can have a warm-up time of up to 10 minutes; more modern units warm up in less than 2 minutes. Some of the very latest encoders incorporate unheated 'instant on' type sensors. During the warm-up of older style units the height information may gradually increase until it settles at its final value. This is not normally a problem as the power would typically be applied before the aircraft enters the runway and so it would be transmitting correct height information soon after take-off.&lt;ref name="Shadin_2016"/&gt;

Light aircraft electrical systems are typically 14&amp;nbsp;V or 28&amp;nbsp;V. To allow seamless integration with either, the encoder uses a number of [[open-collector]] ([[open-drain]]) [[transistor]]s to interface to the transponder. The height information is represented as 11 binary digits in a parallel form using 11 separate lines designated D2 D4 A1 A2 A4 B1 B2 B4 C1 C2 C4.&lt;ref name="Darryl_1998_MODEC"/&gt; As a twelfth bit, the Gillham code contains a D1 bit but this is unused and consequently set to zero in practical applications.

Different classes of altitude encoder do not use all of the available bits. All use the A, B and C bits; increasing altitude limits require more of the D bits. Up to and including 30700&amp;nbsp;ft does not require any of the D bits (9-wire interface&lt;ref name="Honeywell_2002"/&gt;). This is suitable for most light general aviation aircraft. Up to and including 62700&amp;nbsp;ft requires D4 (10-wire interface&lt;ref name="Tooley-Wyatt_2009"/&gt;). Up to and including 126700&amp;nbsp;ft requires D4 and D2 (11-wire interface&lt;ref name="Tooley-Wyatt_2009"/&gt;). D1 is never used.&lt;ref name="Darryl_1998_ASCII"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DFS_2000"/&gt;

== Decoding ==
Bits D2 (msbit) through B4 (lsbit) encode the pressure altitude in 500&amp;nbsp;ft increments (above a base altitude of −1000±250&amp;nbsp;ft) in a standard 8-bit [[reflected binary code]] (Gray code).&lt;ref name="Darryl_1998_ASCII"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stewart_2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gray_1953"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steinbuch_1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steinbuch-Weber_1974"/&gt; The specification stops at code 1000000 (126500±250&amp;nbsp;ft), above which D1 would be needed as a most significant bit.

Bits C1, C2 and C4 use a mirrored 5-state 3-bit Gray BCD code of a [[Giannini Datex code]] type&lt;ref name="Wheeler_1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Datex_1965"/&gt; (with the first 5 states resembling [[O'Brien code type II]]&lt;ref name="O'Brien_1956"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steinbuch_1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steinbuch-Weber_1974"/&gt;) to encode the offset from the 500&amp;nbsp;ft altitude in 100&amp;nbsp;ft increments.&lt;ref name="Darryl_1998_MODEC"/&gt; Specifically, if the parity of the 500&amp;nbsp;ft code is even then codes 001, 011, 010, 110 and 100 encode &amp;minus;200, &amp;minus;100, 0, +100 and +200&amp;nbsp;ft relative to the 500&amp;nbsp;ft altitude. If the parity is odd, the assignments are reversed.&lt;ref name="Darryl_1998_ASCII"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stewart_2010"/&gt; Codes 000, 101 and 111 are not used.&lt;ref name="Decoder Patent"/&gt;{{Rp|13(6.17–21)}}&lt;!-- p. 13, Column 6, lines 17 through 21 --&gt;

The Gillham code can be decoded using various methods. Standard techniques use hardware&lt;ref name="Decoder Patent"/&gt; or software solutions. The latter often uses a lookup table but an algorithmic approach can be taken.&lt;ref name="Stewart_2010"/&gt;

In [[computer programming]], '''glue code''' is executable code (often [[source code]]) that serves solely to "adapt" different parts of code that would otherwise be incompatible. Glue code does not contribute any functionality towards meeting program [[requirement]]s. Instead, it often appears in code that lets existing [[Library (computing)|libraries]] or programs [[Interoperability#Software|interoperate]], as in [[language binding]]s or [[foreign function interface]]s such as the [[Java native interface]], when mapping [[Object (computer science)|objects]] to a [[database]] using [[object-relational mapping]], or when [[Systems integration|integrating]] two or more [[commercial off-the-shelf]] programs. Glue code may be written in the same language as the code it is gluing together, or in a separate [[glue language]]. Glue code is very efficient in [[rapid prototyping]] environments where several components are quickly put together into a single language or framework.

==Consequences==
Because each component is independent (i.e. it is unaware of its relations and is only connected to another component through glue code), the behavior of a component and its interactions can change during the execution of the script. In addition, a different version of one of the components may behave differently, breaking the glue code.

High-level programming languages can suffer from performance penalties because glue code must run through the language interpreter, even when connecting high-performance subsystems. If performance is crucial, using configuration scripting is often preferred to directly connecting binary interfaces of components. In object-oriented scripting languages, glue code often eliminates the need for class hierarchies and large numbers of classes.

[[File:Stirnspiegel HNO.jpg|thumb|300px|Head mirror]]
[[Image:Head mirror in use.png|right|thumb|300px|A doctor using a head mirror to illuminate his patient's nasal passages.]]
A '''head mirror''' is a simple diagnostic device, [[stereotype|stereotypically]] worn by [[physician]]s, but less so in recent decades as they have become somewhat obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enttoday.org/article/an-iconic-tool-is-there-still-a-place-for-the-head-mirror/ Enttoday.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

A head mirror is mostly used for examination of the ear, nose &amp; throat. It comprises a circular concave mirror, with a small hole in the middle, and is attached to a head band. The mirror is worn over the physician's eye of choice, with the concave mirror surface facing outwards and the hole directly over the physician's eye, providing illumination like a [[ring light]].

In use, the patient sits and faces the physician. A bright lamp is positioned adjacent to the patient's head, pointing toward the physician's face and hence towards the head mirror. The light from the lamp reflects off the mirror, along the line of sight of the user, with the light being somewhat concentrated by the curvature of the mirror. When used properly, the head mirror thus provides excellent shadow-free illumination.

Because they were once in common use, notably by [[general practitioner]]s and [[otolaryngology|otorhinolaryngologists]], head mirrors are often a stereotypical part of a physician's uniform by costumers and prop men e.g. in comic routines. The main drawback to head mirrors was that they require some skill to use well.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} They are rarely seen outside of the [[otolaryngology|ENT]] setting, having been largely replaced by pen lights among [[general practitioner]]s. They are still routinely used by otolaryngologists, particularly for examination and procedures involving the oral cavity.

An '''implant''' is a [[medical device]] manufactured to replace a missing biological structure, support a damaged biological structure, or enhance an existing biological structure. Medical implants are man-made devices, in contrast to a [[Organ transplant|transplant]], which is a transplanted [[biomedical tissue]]. The surface of implants that contact the body might be made of a [[Biomaterial|biomedical material]] such as [[titanium]], [[silicone]], or [[apatite]] depending on what is the most functional.&lt;ref name="WongBio12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mE9iK9UibNAC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Biomaterials: Principles and Practices |editor1=Wong, J.Y. |editor2=Bronzino, J.D. |editor3=Peterson, D.R. |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, Florida |pages=281 |year=2012 |isbn=9781439872512 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases implants contain electronics e.g. [[artificial pacemaker]] and [[cochlear implant]]s.

== Applications ==
Implants can roughly be categorized into groups by application.

===Sensory and neurological===
[[Perception|Sensory]] and [[Neurotechnology#Implant technologies|neurological]] implants are used for disorders affecting the major senses and the brain, as well as other neurological disorders. They are predominately used in the treatment of conditions such as [[cataract]], [[glaucoma]], [[keratoconus]], and other [[visual impairment]]s; [[otosclerosis]] and other [[hearing loss]] issues, as well as middle ear diseases such as [[otitis media]]; and neurological diseases such as [[epilepsy]], [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[treatment-resistant depression]]. Examples include the [[intraocular lens]], [[intrastromal corneal ring segment]], [[cochlear implant]], [[tympanostomy tube]], and [[Neurostimulation|neurostimulator]].&lt;ref name="WongBio12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FDAClassDB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McLatchieOx13"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UaLIRStfy6IC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Oxford Handbook of Clinical Surgery |editor1=McLatchie, G. |editor2=Borley, N. |editor3=Chikwe, J. |publisher=OUP Oxford |location=Oxford, UK |pages=794 |year=2013 |isbn=9780199699476 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardiovascular===
[[Circulatory system|Cardiovascular]] medical devices are implanted in cases where the heart, its valves, and the rest of the circulatory system is in disorder. They are used to treat conditions such as [[heart failure]], [[cardiac arrhythmia]], [[ventricular tachycardia]], [[valvular heart disease]], [[angina pectoris]], and [[atherosclerosis]]. Examples include the [[artificial heart]], [[artificial heart valve]], [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]], [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker|cardiac pacemaker]], and [[coronary stent]].&lt;ref name="WongBio12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FDAClassDB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McLatchieOx13" /&gt;

===Orthopedic===
[[Orthopedic surgery|Orthopaedic]] implants help alleviate issues with the bones and joints of the body. They're used to treat [[bone fracture]]s, [[osteoarthritis]], [[scoliosis]], [[spinal stenosis]], and [[chronic pain]]. Examples include a wide variety of [[internal fixator|pins, rods, screws, and plates]] used to anchor fractured bones while they heal.&lt;ref name="WongBio12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FDAClassDB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McLatchieOx13" /&gt;

Metallic glasses based on magnesium with zinc and calcium addition are tested as the potential metallic biomaterials for biodegradable medical implants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ibrahim|first1=H.|last2=Esfahani|first2=S.

Patient with orthopaedic implants sometimes need to be put under [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) machine for detailed musculoskeletal study. Therefore, concerns have been raised regarding the loosening and migration of implant, heating of the implant metal which could cause thermal damage to surrounding tissues, and distortion of the MRI scan that affects the imaging results. A study of orthopaedic implants in 2005 has shown that majority of the orthopaedic implants does not react with magnetic fields under the 1.0 [[Tesla (unit)|Tesla]] MRI scanning machine with the exception of external fixator clamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ritabh|first1=Kumar|last2=Richard|first2=A Lerski|last3=Stephen|first3=Gandy|last4=Benedict|first4=A Clift|last5=Rami|first5=J Abboud|title=Safety of orthopedic implants in magnetic resonance imaging: An experimental verification|journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Research|date=12 July 2006|volume=24|issue=9|pages=1799–1802|doi=10.1002/jor.20213|pmid=16838376}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at 7.0 Tesla, several orthopaedic implants would show significant interaction with the MRI magnetic fields, such as [[heel]] and [[fibula]]r implant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=David|first1=X Feng|last2=Joseph|first2=P McCauley|title=Evaluation of 39 medical implants at 7.0 T|journal=British Journal of Radiology|date=9 November 2015|volume=88|issue=1056|pages=20150633|doi=10.1259/bjr.20150633|pmid=26481696|pmc=4984944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contraception===
[[Birth control|Contraceptive]] implants are primarily used to prevent [[unintended pregnancy]] and treat conditions such as non-pathological forms of [[menorrhagia]]. Examples include [[IUD with copper|copper]]- and [[IUD with progestogen|hormone]]-based [[intrauterine device]]s.&lt;ref name="FDAClassDB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McLatchieOx13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FalconeClin07"&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YAejBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT419 |chapter=Chapter 27: Modern Concepts in Intrauterine Devices |title=Clinical Reproductive Medicine and Surgery |author1=Duke, J. |author2=Barhan, S. |editor1=Falcone, T. |editor2=Hurd, W. |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |year=2007 |pages=405–416 |isbn=9780323076593 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmetic===
[[Plastic surgery|Cosmetic]] implants — often [[prosthetics]] — attempt to bring some portion of the body back to an acceptable aesthetic norm. They are used as a follow-up to [[mastectomy]] due to [[breast cancer]], for correcting some forms of [[disfigurement]], and modifying aspects of the body (as in [[buttock augmentation]] and [[chin augmentation]]). Examples include the [[breast implant]], [[nose prosthesis]], [[ocular prosthesis]], and [[injectable filler]].&lt;ref name="WongBio12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FDAClassDB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McLatchieOx13" /&gt;

===Other organs and systems===
Other types of [[organ dysfunction]] can occur in the systems of the body, including the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urological systems. Implants are used in those and other locations to treat conditions such as [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]], [[gastroparesis]], [[respiratory failure]], [[sleep apnea]], [[urinary incontinence|urinary]] and [[fecal incontinence]], and [[erectile dysfunction]]. Examples include the [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease#Surgery|LINX]], [[Implantable gastric stimulation|implantable gastric stimulator]], [[Diaphragm pacing|diaphragmatic/phrenic nerve stimulator]], neurostimulator, [[surgical mesh]], and [[penile prosthesis]].&lt;ref name="FDAClassDB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McLatchieOx13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USCLINX"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.surgery.usc.edu/uppergi-general/gastroesophagealrefluxdisease-linx-beforeduringafter.html |title=Upper G.I.

==Classification==
===United States classification===
[[Medical devices]] are classified by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) under three different classes depending on the risks the medical device may impose on the user.According to 21CFR 860.3, Class I devices are considered to pose the least amount of risk to the user and require the least amount of control. Class I devices include simple devices such as arm slings and hand-held [[surgical instruments]]. Class II devices are considered to need more regulation than Class I devices and are required to undergo specific requirements before FDA approval. Class II devices include X-ray systems and physiological monitors. Class III devices require the most regulatory controls since the device supports or sustains human life or may not be well tested. Class III devices include replacement [[heart valves]] and implanted cerebellar stimulators. Many implants typically fall under Class II and Class III devices.&lt;ref name="SyringOver03"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qrasupport.com/FDA_MED_DEVICE.html |title=Overview: FDA Regulation of Medical Devices |author=Syring, G. |publisher=Quality and Regulatory Associates, LLC |date=6 May 2003 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FDAClassify"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Overview/ClassifyYourDevice/ |title=Classify Your Medical Device |work=FDA.gov/MedicalDevices |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |date=29 July 2014 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications==
[[File:Ruptured implant.JPG|thumb|300px|Complications can arise from implant failure. Internal rupturing of a breast implant can lead to bacterial infection, for example.]]
Under ideal conditions, implants should initiate the desired [[host response]]. Ideally, the implant should not cause any undesired reaction from neighboring or distant tissues. However, the interaction between the implant and the tissue surrounding the implant can lead to complications.&lt;ref name="WongBio12" /&gt; The process of implantation of medical devices is subjected to the same complications that other invasive medical procedures can have during or after surgery. Common complications include [[infection]], [[inflammation]], and [[pain]]. Other complications that can occur include risk of [[Transplant rejection|rejection]] from implant-induced [[coagulation]] and [[Foreign body response|allergic foreign body response]]. Depending on the type of implant, the complications may vary.&lt;ref name="WongBio12" /&gt;

When the site of an implant becomes infected during or after surgery, the surrounding tissue becomes infected by [[microorganisms]]. Three main categories of infection can occur after operation. Superficial immediate infections are caused by organisms that commonly grow near or on skin. The infection usually occurs at the surgical opening. Deep immediate infection, the second type, occurs immediately after surgery at the site of the implant. Skin-dwelling and airborne [[bacteria]] cause deep immediate infection. These bacteria enter the body by attaching to the implant’s surface prior to implantation. Though not common, deep immediate infections can also occur from dormant bacteria from previous infections of the tissue at the implantation site that have been activated from being disturbed during the surgery. The last type, late infection, occurs months to years after the implantation of the implant. Late infections are caused by dormant [[blood-borne]] bacteria attached to the implant prior to implantation. The blood-borne bacteria colonize on the implant and eventually get released from it. Depending on the type of material used to make the implant, it may be infused with [[antibiotic]]s to lower the risk of infections during surgery. However, only certain types of materials can be infused with antibiotics, the use of antibiotic-infused implants runs the risk of rejection by the patient since the patient may develop a sensitivity to the antibiotic, and the antibiotic may not work on the bacteria.&lt;ref name="BlackBio06"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kDLx3mKm1EC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Biological Performance of Materials: Fundamentals of Biocompatibility |author=Black, J. |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, Florida |year=2006 |pages=520 |isbn=9780849339592 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inflammation, a common occurrence after any surgical procedure, is the body’s response to tissue damage as a result of trauma, infection, intrusion of foreign materials, or local [[cell death]], or as a part of an [[Immune system|immune response]]. Inflammation starts with the rapid dilation of local [[Capillary|capillaries]] to supply the local tissue with blood. The inflow of blood causes the tissue to become swollen and may cause cell death. The excess blood, or edema, can activate pain receptors at the tissue. The site of the inflammation becomes warm from local disturbances of fluid flow and the increased cellular activity to repair the tissue or remove debris from the site.&lt;ref name="BlackBio06" /&gt;

Implant-induced coagulation is similar to the [[Coagulation#Physiology|coagulation process]] done within the body to prevent blood loss from damaged blood vessels. However, the coagulation process is triggered from [[protein]]s that become attached to the implant surface and lose their shapes. When this occurs, the protein changes conformation and different activation sites become exposed, which may trigger an immune system response where the body attempts to attack the implant to remove the foreign material. The trigger of the immune system response can be accompanied by inflammation. The immune system response may lead to chronic inflammation where the implant is rejected and has to be removed from the body. The immune system may encapsulate the implant as an attempt to remove the foreign material from the site of the tissue by encapsulating the implant in [[fibrinogen]] and [[platelet]]s. The encapsulation of the implant can lead to further complications, since the thick layers of fibrous encapsulation may prevent the implant from performing the desired functions. Bacteria may attack the fibrous encapsulation and become embedded into the fibers. Since the layers of fibers are thick, antibiotics may not be able to reach the bacteria and the bacteria may grow and infect the surrounding tissue. In order to remove the bacteria, the implant would have to be removed. Lastly, the immune system may accept the presence of the implant and repair and remodel the surrounding tissue. Similar responses occur when the body initiates an allergic foreign body response. In the case of an allergic foreign body response, the implant would have to be removed.&lt;ref name="DeeAnIntro02"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KEXVyjO8KQIC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=An Introduction to Tissue-Biomaterial Interactions |author1=Dee, K.C. |author2=Puleo, D.A. |author3=Bizios, R. |publisher=Wiley-Liss |location=Hoboken, NJ |year=2002 |pages=248 |isbn=9780471461128 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failures==
{{main|Implant failure}}
The many examples of [[implant failure]] include [[Breast implant#Implant rupture|rupture]] of silicone [[breast implant]]s, [[hip replacement]] joints, and [[artificial heart valves]], such as the [[Bjork–Shiley valve]], all of which have caused FDA intervention. The consequences of implant failure depend on the nature of the implant and its position in the body. Thus, heart valve failure is likely to threaten the life of the individual, while breast implant or hip joint failure is less likely to be life-threatening.&lt;ref name="WongBio12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeeAnIntro02" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WagenbergARetro06"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wagenberg |first1=B. |last2=Froum |first2=S.J. |title=A retrospective study of 1925 consecutively placed immediate implants from 1988 to 2004 |journal=The International Journal of Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Implants |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=71–80 |year=2006 |pmid=16519184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devices implanted directly in the grey matter of the brain produce the highest quality signals, but are prone to [[scar|scar-tissue]] build-up, causing the signal to become weaker, or even non-existent, as the body reacts to a foreign object in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Polikov, Vadim S. |author2=Patrick A.

'''Jane Nambakire Mulemwa''' is a [[Uganda]]n [[chemist]] and educator. She is the chairperson of the [[Petroleum Authority of Uganda]].

==Background and education==
She was born in the [[Central Region, Uganda|Central Region]] of [[Uganda]] on 18 September 1953. She attended [[Mount St Mary's College Namagunga]]. She studied chemistry and biology at [[Makerere University]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree and a concurrent [[Diploma of Education]]. From 1976 until 1979, she studied for her master's degree in chemistry, also at Makerere. She attended [[Queen's University Belfast]] from 1980 until 1982, graduating with a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in chemistry in 1982.&lt;ref name="Profile"&gt;{{cite web | location=Kampala | title=Dr. Jane N.

==Career==
While pursuing her master's degree at Makerere University from 1976 until 1979, Mulemwa taught undergraduates in the Department of Education at the university and taught high school students at the nearby [[Makerere College School]]. Between 1980 and 1982, while pursuing her doctorate degree in [[Belfast]], she was a "demonstrator" to undergraduates in chemistry at [[Queen's University Belfast]], Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt;

She returned to Uganda in 1982 to be a lecturer in chemistry and science education at Makerere University. In 1988, she served as senior lecturer in chemistry and science education at the Department of Science and Technical Education, serving in that capacity until 1998. She then joined the Education Service Commission, rising to the rank of deputy chairperson.&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt;

In 2015, she was appointed by President [[Yoweri Museveni]] to chair the newly created Petroleum Authority of Uganda, the autonomous regulator of the petroleum industry. In September 2015, [[Parliament of Uganda|Uganda's parliament]] approved her appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ugandaradionetwork.com/story/petroleum-authority-boss-oil-sector-requires-total-transparency | title=Petroleum Authority Boss Promises Sector Transparency | date=14 September 2015 | accessdate=23 February 2016 | first=Olive | last=Eyotaru | publisher=Uganda Radio Network | location=Kampala}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1410845/invest-energy-resources-development-capacity-museveni | title=Invest energy resources in development capacity - Museveni | accessdate=23 February 2016 | date=24 October 2015 | last=Vision Reporter | newspaper=[[New Vision]] | location=Kmpala}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chimpreports.com/museveni-commissions-national-oil-company-petroleum-authority | title=Museveni Commissions National Oil Company, Petroleum Authority | accessdate=23 February 2014 | date=24 October 2015 | publisher=Chimpreports.com | first=Linda | last=Kabuzire | location=Kampala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''JavaScript Interpreter SHell''' (or Jsi for short) is a scripting language designed for use in [[embedded systems]].

It is a language used primarily by applications written in [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[C++]] using [[GNU]] tool-chains.
[[MinGW]] provides [[Windows]] compatibility.

Jsi code compiles as either [[C99]] or C++, with the C++ support being native instead of "extern C".

== History ==

Jsi was created as an embedded application replacement for [[Tcl]] and JimTcl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jim.tcl.tk |title=Jim Tcl |accessdate=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Its main goal is to provide embedded scripting using
a mostly standard syntax ([[JavaScript syntax|JavaScript]]), as opposed to the
idiosyncratic ones used in Tcl, [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]].
A secondary goal is data compatibility with [[Web Browsers]] using [[JSON]].
Speed is not a major goal.

Life for Jsi started as a fork of the quad-wheel interpreter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://code.google.com/archive/p/quad-wheel/ |title=Quadwheel |accessdate=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Eventually, most of the major internal features of Tcl were added.
The current implementation is nearly 10 times the size of the original,
and very little of the original code remains.

== Features ==

Jsi comes with builtin support for [[SQLite]], [[WebSocket]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://libwebsockets.org/ |title=LibWebsockets |accessdate=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and a self-hosting [[zip (file format)|ZIP]] file-systems.
The jsish executable is unusual in that it
integrates a self-mounting file system containing builtin utilities and applications.
These include a Debugger and a Web-Server, which is used to provide web user-interfaces for the Debugger and Sqlite.
Each of these applications can be accessed via jsish command-line arguments.

Jsi is highly independent:

*  The configuration script for Jsi is itself written in Jsi.  To achieve this, a minimal standalone jsish is first built to bootstrap configuration.
*  An amalgamated source file is provided to support trivial integration into existing applications.
*  The jsish binary can be built and statically linked against [[musl]] to produce a standalone with no external dependencies.

Scripts and extensions are unusually robust due to functions that support [[Duck typing|duck]] typed-parameters.
The implementation is mature and has a rich and resilient development environment that
includes integrated logging, asserts and strict mode.

As of the December 2017 2.4 release, Jsi is considered to be feature-stable.

Jsi implements version 5.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/index.html |title=ECMAScript 5.1 |accessdate=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
of the [[ECMAScript]] standard,
with the following deviations:

* No [[automatic semicolon insertion]]. 
* Empty array/object elements are not supported, e.g. [1, 3]. 
* It is an error to use return inside of a try/catch body. 
* The Error object is unimplemented: the argument to catch() is just a string. 
* The Date object is unimplemented: use strftime/strptime. 
* The value of typeof [] is "array" instead of "object". 
* UTF is currently not supported.

There is one major extension: function definitions can use types and defaults.

A '''liquid-ring pump''' is a rotating positive-displacement [[pump]].

They are typically used as a [[vacuum pump]], but can also be used as a [[gas compressor]].
The function of a liquid-ring pump is similar to a [[rotary vane pump]], with the difference being that the vanes are an integral part of the rotor and churn a rotating ring of liquid to form the compression-chamber seal. They are an inherently low-friction design, with the rotor being the only moving part. Sliding friction is limited to the shaft seals. Liquid-ring pumps are typically powered by an [[induction motor]].

==Description of operation==
The liquid-ring pump compresses gas by rotating a vaned [[impeller]] located [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentrically]] within a cylindrical casing.  Liquid (usually water) is fed into the pump and, by centrifugal acceleration, forms a moving cylindrical ring against the inside of the casing.  This liquid ring creates a series of seals in the space between the impeller vanes, which form compression chambers.  The eccentricity between the impeller's axis of rotation and the casing geometric axis results in a cyclic variation of the volume enclosed by the vanes and the ring.

Gas, often air, is drawn into the pump through an inlet port in the end of the casing. The gas is trapped in the compression chambers formed by the impeller vanes and the liquid ring. The reduction in volume caused by the impeller rotation compresses the gas, which reports to the discharge port in the end of the casing.

Compressed gas on discharge of pump contains certain amount of working liquid which is usually removed in [[vapor–liquid separator]].

== History ==
The earliest liquid-ring pumps date from 1903, when a patent was granted in Germany to [[Siemens-Schuckert]]. US Patent 1,091,529, for liquid-ring vacuum pumps and compressors, was granted to [[Lewis H. Nash]] in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=7vJfAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=1,091,529 google.com]&lt;/ref&gt; They were manufactured by the [[Nash Engineering Company]] in Norwalk, CT. Around the same time, in Austria, Patent 69274 was granted to Siemens-Schuckertwerke for a similar liquid-ring vacuum pump.

==Types and Applications==
===Single- and multistage===
[[File:SIHI liquid-ring vacuum pump pic01.jpg|thumb|Single-stage vacuum pump&lt;br&gt;in bioethanol plant]]
Liquid-ring systems can be single- or multistage. Typically a multistage pump will have up to two compression stages on a common shaft. In vacuum service, the attainable pressure reduction is limited by the vapour pressure of the ring-liquid. As the generated vacuum approaches the vapour pressure of the ring-liquid, the increasing volume of vapor released from the ring-liquid diminishes the remaining vacuum capacity. The efficiency of the system declines as a result.

Single-stage vacuum pumps typically produce vacuum to 35 [[Torr]] (mm Hg) or {{Convert|47|mbar|kPa}}, and two-stage pumps can produce vacuum to 25 Torr, assuming air is being pumped and the ring-liquid is water at 15&amp;nbsp;°C (60&amp;nbsp;°F) or less. Dry air and 15&amp;nbsp;°C sealant-water temperature is the standard performance basis, which most manufacturers use for their performance curves.

===Recirculation of ring-liquid===
Some ring-liquid is also entrained with the discharge stream. This liquid is separated from the gas stream by other equipment external to the pump. In some systems, the discharged ring-liquid is cooled by a [[heat exchanger]] or [[cooling tower]], then returned to the pump casing. In some recirculating systems, contaminants from the gas become trapped in the ring-liquid, depending on system configuration. These contaminants become concentrated as the liquid continues to recirculate, eventually causes damage and reduced life to the pump. In this case, filtration systems are required to ensure that contamination is kept to acceptable levels.

In non-recirculating systems, the discharged hot liquid (usually water) is treated as a waste stream. In this case fresh cool water is used to make up the loss. Environmental considerations are making such "once-through" systems increasingly rare.
These simple, but highly reliable pumps have a variety of industrial applications. They are used to maintain condenser vacuum on large steam-turbine generator sets by removing incondensable gasses, where vacuum levels are typically 30–50 mbar. They are used on [[paper machine]]s to dewater the pulp slurry and to extract water from press felts. Another application is the vacuum forming of molded paper-pulp products ([[egg carton]]s and other packaging). Other applications include soil remediation, where contaminated [[ground water]] is drawn from wells by vacuum. In petroleum refining, [[vacuum distillation]] also makes use of liquid-ring vacuum pumps to provide the process vacuum. Liquid-ring compressors are often used in [[vapor recovery]] systems.

===Liquid type===
Liquid-ring vacuum pumps can use any liquid compatible with the process, provided it has the appropriate vapor pressure properties, as the sealant liquid. Although the most common sealant is water, almost any liquid can be used. The second most common is oil. Since oil has a very low vapor pressure, oil-sealed liquid-ring vacuum pumps are typically air-cooled. For dry chlorine gas applications concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] is used.

The ability to use any liquid allows the liquid-ring vacuum pump to be ideally suited for solvent (vapor) recovery. If a process, such as distillation or a vacuum dryer, is generating toluene vapors, for example, then it is possible to use toluene as the sealant, provided the cooling water is cold enough to keep the vapor pressure of the sealant liquid low enough to pull the desired vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wintek-corp.com/liquid-ring/solvent-sealed-liquid-ring.html|title=Solvent sealed liquid ring vacuum pump systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ionic liquids]] in liquid-ring vacuum pumps can lower the vacuum pressure from about 70 mbar to below 1 mbar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basionics.com/en/ionic-liquids/applications/engineering.htm basionics.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901122445/http://www.basionics.com/en/ionic-liquids/applications/engineering.htm |date=2009-09-01 }} Ionic liquids – designable materials for high-performing fluids.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Multi-objective Design Space Exploration of MultiProcessor-SoC Architectures for Embedded Multimedia Applications" (MULTICUBE)''' 
is a [[Seventh Framework Programme]] (FP7) project aimed to define innovative methods for the design optimization of computer architectures for the embedded system domain.

==Background==

[[Embedded systems]] are specialized computing systems for wide domain of applications ranging from [[mobile phones]] and [[Wearable computer|wearable electronics]] for military applications to control systems for [[automobile]],  [[factories]] and [[home automation]].
Even if all these domains are different, they are all characterized by their computational and programmability needs. All these applications need an underlying computing platform specially designed to cater to the application needs.

The improvements in Very Large Scale Integrations technology ([[VLSI]]) and the availability of the high  computational power provided by [[System-on-a-Chip]] (SoC) has enabled development of highly sophisticated embedded applications.&lt;ref&gt;Nan Yuan, Yongbin Zhou, Guangming Tan, Junchao Zhang, Dongrui Fan. "High Performance Matrix Multiplication on Many Cores." In proceedings of the 15th international Euro-Par conference on Parallel Processing. 2009-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Mariani, Vittorio Zaccaria, Gianluca Palermo, Prabhat Avasare, Geert Vanmeerbeeck, Chantal Ykman-Couvreur, Cristina Silvano. "An industrial [[design space exploration]] framework for supporting run- time resource management on multi-core systems". In DATE 2010 - International Conference on Design, Automation and Test in Europe. Dresden, Germany. March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the computer architectures are often designed in a [[multi-core]] paradigm, where more processors are integrated onto the same chip/die. This type of computer architecture can also be referred to as Chip-MultiProcessors (CMP), MultiProcessor-SoC (MPSoC) or, [[Network On Chip]] (NoC) where different processors communicate via a network infrastructure.

==Challenges in MPSoC Design Optimization==

Designing complex systems on chip many platform parameters has to be tuned. This is done in order to maximize platform performances while minimizing non functional costs such as the power consumption. This tuning phase is called [[Design Space Exploration]] (DSE). This process can be formalized as a [[multiobjective optimization]] problem where non-commensurable objectives have to be maximized (or minimized).

In the context of MPSoC design, the problem is two fold:

* Given the large amount of platform parameters and the large number of values that these parameters can assume, the design space of advanced computer architectures is huge. Theoretically, identifying the [[Pareto-optimal]] solutions in such space requires the evaluation of each platform configuration value sets. This is impracticable.
* The evaluation of a single candidate architecture configuration generally requires the performance analysis over a detailed system model. Generally this analysis is performed via computationally expensive [[simulations]]. Depending on platform and application complexity a single computer simulation can take hours or even days.

==MULTICUBE Approach==

With the aim to reduce the design time of future embedded systems, the MULTICUBE project faces the problems related to multiobjective DSE of MPSoC platforms.&lt;ref&gt;C. Kavka, L. Onesti, P. Avasare, G. Vanmeerbeeck, M. Wouters and H. Posadas. "Design Space Exploration for Embedded Parallel System-on-Chip Platforms using modeFRONTIER" at the Second Mini Conference on Theoretical Computer Science, 12th International Information Society Multiconference, Koper, Slovenia, October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
The MULTICUBE project defines an automatic framework for DSE providing advanced methodologies for heuristic optimization and techniques for analyzing the effects of platform parameters in order to restrict the search space to the crucial ones enabling an efficient optimization.

To have a trade-off between exploration speed and solution accuracy, the MULTICUBE project proposes a multilevel modeling methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Mariani, Gianluca Palermo, Cristina Silvano, Vittorio Zaccaria. "Multiprocessor System-on-Chip Design Space Exploration based on Multi-level Modeling Techniques" In Proceedings of IEEE IC- SAMOS'09 - International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, MOdeling, and Simulation, Samos, Greece, July 2009, pp. 118-124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gianluca Palermo, Cristina Silvano and Vittorio Zaccaria. "ReSPIR: A Response Surface-based Pareto Iterative Refinement for Application-Specific Design Space Exploration " In IEEE Transactions on Computer- Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems. Volume 28 Issue 12, December 2009 pp. 1816-1829&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying idea is that the expensive simulations with a detailed low-level system model are not always needed. Rather, for obtaining sufficient number of design points, approximate but faster evaluation methods are acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;H. Posadas, E. Villar, G. de Miguel. "Automatic generation of modifiable platform models in SystemC for Automatic System Architecture Exploration " In DCIS2009 - XXIV Conference on Design of Circuits and Integrated Systems, Zaragoza, Spain. 2009-11&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the multilevel system modeling enables quick analysis of many design points using high level models. The final configuration is obtained by performing a more accurate low level simulations on the most promising candidates obtained from the high level approximation methods.

Among other activities, the MULTICUBE project develops [[Open-source software|open source]] tools for MPSoC modeling and optimization providing to the research and engineering communities the above mentioned methodologies.

The '''Mead &amp; Conway revolution''' was a very-large-scale integration ([[VLSI]]) design revolution which resulted in a worldwide restructuring of academic education, and was paramount for the development of industries based on the application of [[microelectronics]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

== Details ==

Immediately after the invention and commercialization of the [[integrated circuit]] (with 100 or fewer transistors in a chip), the design was co-located with [[integrated circuit|integrated circuit technology]]. The circuits' design capability centered in the hands of industry, with universities falling behind in their capability to design computers and systems. But, as predicted by [[Moore’s law]], the number of transistors which fit in a chip doubled every two years, meaning that because of the high circuit complexity, the [[Semiconductor device|device]] physics experts were not qualified enough to cope. For this reason, [[Carver Mead]], who coined the term "Moore's law", called for a separation of design from technology throughout the 1970s in order to establish [[electronic design automation]] (EDA) as its own discipline developing its own methodologies.

In 1978–79, when approximately 20,000 transistors could be fabricated in a single chip, [[Carver Mead]] and [[Lynn Conway]] wrote the textbook ''Introduction to VLSI Systems'' ({{ISBN|0201043580}}) published in 1979 which became a bestseller. It was the first VLSI design textbook for non-technologists. The authors intended the book to fill a gap in the literature and introduce [[electrical engineering]] and [[computer science]] students to [[Architecture of Integrated Information Systems|integrated system architecture]]. This textbook triggered a breakthrough in education. Mead &amp; Conway VLSI design courses were created in many universities. Computer science and electrical engineering professors throughout the world started teaching VLSI system design and used this textbook. Many of them also obtained a copy of [[Lynn Conway]]'s notes for her famous [[MIT]] course in 1978, which included a collection of exercises.

An important milestone that followed was the [[Multi Project Chip]] (MPC) concept that allowed multiple designs to be fabricated on a single wafer, greatly reducing cost to the point that students' design exercises and prototypes could be fabbed in small numbers. The first successful run of an MPC line was demonstrated at Lynn Conway's 1978 VLSI design course at MIT. A few weeks after completion of their designs, the students had the fabricated prototypes in their hands, available for testing. Lynn Conway's improved new [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]] MPC VLSI implementation system and service was operated successfully for a dozen universities by late 1979. It was then transferred to [[University of Southern California]] [[Information Sciences Institute]], becoming the foundation for Metal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation Service ([[MOSIS]]), which has evolved since 1981 as a national infrastructure for fast-turnaround prototyping of VLSI chip designs by universities and researchers.

In 1980 [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] began the [[United States Department of Defense|DoD's]] new [[VLSI project|VLSI research program]] to support extensions of this work, resulting in many university and industry researchers being involved in following up the Mead-Conway innovations. The Mead &amp; Conway revolution rapidly spread around the world and many national Mead &amp; Conway scenes were organized, like the German multi-university [[:de:E.I.S.|E.I.S. project]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4514">'''Medarex''' (former NASDAQ symbol: '''MEDX''' ) was an [[United States|American]] [[biopharmaceutical]] company based in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]], with manufacturing facilities in [[Bloomsbury, New Jersey|Bloomsbury]] and [[Annandale, New Jersey|Annandale]], New Jersey, and research facilities in [[Milpitas, California|Milpitas]] and [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]], [[California]].  In 2009, Medarex was purchased by [[Bristol Myers Squibb]].

Medarex developed [[monoclonal antibodies]] to [[CTLA-4]] and [[PD-1]], which are proteins on the surface of [[T cells]]. T cells attack cancer cells, but CTLA-4 and PD-1 act as "brakes" on the T cell's anti-cancer activities. The monoclonal antibodies bind to these proteins and block them, releasing the T cell to attack cancer cells.&lt;ref name="Science"&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6165/1432.full Breakthrough of the Year: Cancer Immunotherapy], Science 20 December 2013, Vol. 342 no. 6165 pp. 1432-1433, DOI: 10.1126/science.342.6165.1432, Jennifer Couzin-Frankel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00094653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several monoclonal antibodies developed by Medarex have been approved for disease therapy. In 2009, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved [[Simponi]], a human monoclonal antibody to [[tumor necrosis factor alpha]] co-developed with [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]]'s [[Janssen Biotech]], for treatment of arthritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2009-05-04/marcial-medarex-a-bright-spot-in-biotechbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice|title=Marcial: Medarex, a Bright Spot in Biotech|last=Marcial|first=Gene|website=businessweek.com|date=4 May 2009|accessdate= 24 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2011, the U.S. FDA approved [[ipilimumab]], a monoclonal antibody to CTLA-4, for treatment of metastatic melanoma.&lt;ref name="Science"/&gt;

==History==

Medarex was founded in 1987 by a group of immunologists at [[Dartmouth Medical School]]—Dr. Michael W. Fanger, Dr. Paul M. Guyre, and Dr. Edward D. Ball — who partnered with [[Donald L. Drakeman]] and Charles Schaller of Essex Chemical Company, through its venture capital arm Essex Vencap. Drakeman, a [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] graduate, brought the parties together and served as the company's chief executive officer. The company went public in 1991, with 2,300,000 shares of common stock at $6.10 per share and 2,250,000 Redeemable Warrants offered at its IPO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/deals/199130138|title=Medarex raises $12.9M in IPO for R&amp;D of Biospecific|date=1 May 1991|accessdate=24 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The company's second president and CEO was Howard H. Pien, succeeding Drakeman in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.princetoninfo.com/index.php/component/us1more/?key=05-23-2007_f_01 | title=Life in the Fast Lane: New at Medarex | date=23 May 2007 | accessdate=24 Sep 2014 | website=pharmamedtechbi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Genmab]] was founded as a European spin-off of American Biotech company Medarex in February 1999.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5730">'''Micro heat exchangers,''' '''Micro-scale heat exchangers,'''  or '''microstructured heat exchangers''' are [[heat exchangers]] in which (at least one) [[fluid]] flows in lateral confinements with typical dimensions below 1&amp;nbsp;mm. The most typical such confinement are [[microchannel (microtechnology)|microchannel]]s, which are channels with a [[hydraulic diameter]] below 1&amp;nbsp;mm. Microchannel heat exchangers can be made from metal, ceramic,&lt;ref&gt;Kee, Robert J., et al. "The design, fabrication, and evaluation of a ceramic counter-flow microchannel heat exchanger." Applied Thermal Engineering 31.11 (2011): 2004-2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Microchannel heat exchangers can be used for many applications including:

==Background==
Investigation of microscale thermal devices is motivated by the single phase internal flow correlation for convective heat transfer:
:&lt;math&gt;h=\mathit{Nu}_c \frac{k}{d}&lt;/math&gt;
Where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the [[heat transfer coefficient]], &lt;math&gt;\mathit{Nu}_c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Nusselt number]], &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermal conductivity]] of the fluid and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the [[hydraulic diameter]] of the channel or duct. In internal [[laminar flow]]s, the Nusselt number becomes a constant. This is a result which can be arrived at analytically: For the case of a constant wall temperature, &lt;math&gt;\mathit{Nu}_c=3.657&lt;/math&gt; and for the case of constant [[heat flux]] &lt;math&gt;\mathit{Nu}_c=4.364&lt;/math&gt; for round tubes.&lt;ref name="Convection"&gt;Incropera &amp; Dewitt{{full|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last value is increased to 140/17 = 8.23 for flat parallel plates.[http://www.calpoly.edu/~kshollen/ME350/Examples/Example_14.pdf] As  [[Reynolds number]] is proportional to hydraulic diameter, fluid flow in channels of small hydraulic diameter will predominantly be laminar in character. This correlation therefore indicates that the heat transfer coefficient increases as channel diameter decreases. Should the hydraulic diameter in forced convection be on the order of tens or hundreds of micrometres, an extremely high heat transfer coefficient should result.

This hypothesis was initially investigated by Tuckerman and Pease.&lt;ref name="Tuckerman"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/EDL.1981.25367 |title=High-performance heat sinking for VLSI |year=1981 |last1=Tuckerman |first1=D.B. |last2=Pease |first2=R.F.W. |journal=IEEE Electron Device Letters |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=126–9}}{{psc|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their positive results led to further research ranging from classical investigations of single channel heat transfer&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;Santiago, Kenny, Goodson, Zhang{{full|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to more applied investigations in parallel micro-channel and micro scale [[plate fin heat exchanger]]s. Recent work in the field has focused on the potential of two-phase flows at the micro-scale.&lt;ref name="Kasagi"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijmultiphaseflow.2003.09.004 |title=Forced convective boiling heat transfer in microtubes at low mass and heat fluxes |year=2003 |last1=Yen |first1=Tzu-Hsiang |last2=Kasagi |first2=Nobuhide |last3=Suzuki |first3=Yuji |journal=International Journal of Multiphase Flow |volume=29 |issue=12 |pages=1771–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kandlikar"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1115/1.1778187 |title=An Experimental Investigation of Flow Boiling Characteristics of Water in Parallel Microchannels |year=2004 |last1=Steinke |first1=Mark E. |last2=Kandlikar |first2=Satish G. |journal=Journal of Heat Transfer |volume=126 |issue=4 |pages=518}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Purdue"&gt;Mudawar{{full|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification of micro heat exchangers==

Just like "conventional" or "macro scale" [[heat exchanger]]s, micro heat exchangers have one, two or even three&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19680014044.pdf] Noel C. Willis, Jr. "Analysis Of Three-Fluid, Crossflow Heat Exchangers." NASA Technical Report, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, D. C. May 1968, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; fluidic flows. In the case of one fluidic flow, [[heat]] can be transferred to the fluid (each of the fluids can be a [[gas]], a [[liquid]], or a [[multiphase flow]]) from electrically powered heater cartridges, or removed from the fluid by electrically powered elements like [[Thermoelectric effect|Peltier]] chillers. In the case of two fluidic flows, micro heat exchangers are usually classified by the orientation of the fluidic flows to another as "cross flow" or "[[Countercurrent exchange|counter flow]]" devices. If a chemical reaction is conducted inside a micro heat exchanger, the latter is also called a [[microreactor]].

[[File:POKEY chip on an Atari 130XE motherboard.jpg|thumb|Atari POKEY in an Atari 130XE]]
The '''Pot Keyboard Integrated Circuit''' ('''POKEY''')&lt;ref name="service-manual-name"&gt;{{cite manual |title=Atari Home Computer Field Service Manual - 400/800 |section= I. Theory of Operation |publisher=Atari, Inc. |pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a digital [[input/output|I/O]] [[Microprocessor|chip]] designed for the [[Atari 8-bit family]] of home computers and found in Atari [[arcade game]]s of the 1980s. POKEY combines functions for sampling ([[Analog to digital converter|ADC]]) [[potentiometer]]s (such as game [[paddle (game controller)|paddle]]s) and scan matrices of switches (such as a computer [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]]) as well as sound generation. It produces four voices of distinctive [[square wave]] sound, either as clear tones or modified with a number of distortion settings.&lt;ref name="dere"&gt;{{cite book|title=De Re Atari|publisher=Atari, Inc.|chapter=Chapter 7: Sound|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/dere/chapt07.php|date=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; POKEY chips are used for audio in many arcade games including ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'', ''[[Missile Command]]'', ''[[Asteroids Deluxe]]'', and ''[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)|Gauntlet]]''. Some of [[Atari System|Atari's arcade systems]] use multi-core versions with 2 or 4 POKEY chips in a single package for more sound voices. The [[Atari 7800]] console allows a game cartridge to contain a POKEY, providing better sound than the system's audio chip. Only two licensed games make use of this: the ports of ''[[Ballblazer]]'' and ''[[Commando (video game)|Commando]]'', with some later homebrews like ''Bentley Bear and the Crystal Quest'' also making use of it.

The [[Integrated circuit#LSI|LSI]] chip has 40 pins and is identified as C012294.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Current, [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/atari-8-bit/faq/section-12.html "What are the SALLY, ANTIC, CTIA/GTIA, POKEY, and FREDDIE chips?"], Atari 8-Bit Computers: Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/ref&gt; POKEY was designed by Atari employee [[Doug Neubauer]],&lt;ref name=halcyon&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/NEUBAUER.HTM | title=Interview with Doug Neubauer | last1=Hague| first1=James | work =Halcyon Days | date=2002-06-01 | accessdate=January 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who also programmed the original ''[[Star Raiders]]''. The [[USPTO]] granted U.S. Patent 4,314,236 to Atari on February 2, 1982 for an "Apparatus for producing a plurality of audio sound effects".&lt;ref name=uspto&gt;{{cite web | url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=4314236 | title=Apparatus for producing a plurality of audio sound effects | date=1979-01-24 | author = Atari, Inc. | work=United States Patent | accessdate=January 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This referred to POKEY's sound generation abilities.  The inventors listed are Steven T. Mayer and Ronald E. Milner.

No longer manufactured, POKEY is now emulated in software by classic arcade and Atari 8-bit emulators and also via the [[Atari SAP music format]] and associated player.

==Registers==
The Atari 8-bit computers map POKEY to the $D2xx&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt; page and the Atari 5200 console maps it to the $E8xx&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt; page.

POKEY provides 29 Read/Write registers controlling Sound, Paddle input, keyboard input, serial input/output, and interrupts. Many POKEY register addresses have dual purposes performing different functions as a Read vs a Write register. Therefore, no code should read Hardware registers expecting to retrieve the previously written value.

This problem is solved for some registers by Operating System "Shadow" registers implemented in regular RAM that mirror the values of hardware registers.  During the Vertical Blank the Operating System copies the Shadow registers in RAM for Write registers to the corresponding hardware register, and updates Shadow values for Read registers from the hardware accordingly.  Therefore, writes to hardware registers which have corresponding shadow registers will be overwritten by the value of the Shadow registers during the next vertical blank.

Reading values directly from hardware at an unknown stage in the display cycle may return inconsistent results (an example: reading potentiometers).  Operating System Shadow registers for Read registers would usually be the preferred source of information.

Some Write hardware registers do not have corresponding Shadow registers.  They can be safely written by an application without the value being overwritten during the vertical blank.  If the application needs to know the last value written to the register then it is the responsibility of the application to implement its own shadow value to remember what it wrote.

==Audio==
Pokey contains four audio channels with separate frequency, noise and voice level controls.

Each channel has an 8-bit frequency divider and an 8-bit register to select noise and volume.
*AUDF1 to AUDF4&amp;nbsp;– frequency register (AUDio Frequency)
*AUDC1 to AUDC4&amp;nbsp;– volume and noise register (AUDio Control)
*AUDCTL&amp;nbsp;– general register, which controls generators (AUDio ConTroL)

POKEY's sound is distinctive: when the four channels are used independently, there is noticeable detuning of parts of the 12-tone [[equal temperament]] scale, due to lack of pitch accuracy. Channels may be paired for higher accuracy; in addition, multiple forms of [[distortion]] are available, allowing a thicker sound. The distortion is primarily used in music for bass parts.

One of the sound-engines developed for the Atari 8-bit family was called the [[AMP engine]] (Advanced Music Processor). This was used by the musician [[Gary Gilbertson]].

===Audio Channel Frequency===

The AUDF* registers control the frequency or pitch of the corresponding sound channels.   The AUDF* values also control the POKEY hardware timers useful for code that must run in precise intervals more frequent than the vertical blank.

Each AUDF* register is an 8-bit value providing a countdown timer or divisor for the pulses from the POKEY clock.   So, smaller values permit more frequent output of pulses from POKEY, and larger values, less frequent.   The values $0&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt;/0&lt;sub&gt;dec&lt;/sub&gt; to $FF&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt;/255&lt;sub&gt;dec&lt;/sub&gt; are incremented by POKEY to range from $1&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt;/1&lt;sub&gt;dec&lt;/sub&gt; to $100&lt;sub&gt;hex&lt;/sub&gt;/256&lt;sub&gt;dec&lt;/sub&gt;.  The actual audible sound pitch is dependent on the POKEY clock frequency and distortion values chosen.   See [[POKEY#Audio Channel Control|Audio Channel Control]] and [[POKEY#AUDCTL $D208 Write|Audio Control]].

===Audio Channel Control===

The Audio Channel control registers provide volume and distortion control over individual sound channels.  Audio may also be generated independently of the POKEY clock by direct volume manipulation of a sound channel which is useful for playing back digital samples.

|-
| Noise 2 || Noise 1 || Noise 0 || Force Volume || Volume 3 || Volume 2 || Volume 1 || Volume 0 
|}

Bit 0-3: Control over volume level, from 0 to F.

Bit 4: Forced volume-only output. When this bit is set the channel ignores the AUDF timer, noise/distortion controls, and high-pass filter.  Sound is produced only by setting volume bits 0:3 . This feature was used to create digital audio via [[pulse-code modulation]].

Bit 5-7: Shift register settings for noises/distortion.  Bit values described below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Noise Value !! Bits Value !! Description
|-
| 0 0 0 ||  $00 || 5-bit then 17-bit polynomials
|-
| 0 0 1 ||  $20 || 5-bit poly only
|-
| 0 1 0 ||  $40 || 5-bit then 4-bit polys
|-
| 0 1 1 ||  $60 || 5-bit poly only
|-
| 1 0 0 ||  $80 || 17-bit poly only
|-
| 1 0 1 ||  $A0 || no poly (pure tone)
|-
| 1 1 0 ||  $C0 || 4-bit poly only
|-
| 1 1 1 ||  $E0 || no poly (pure tone)
|}

Generating random noises is served by reading 8 bits from top of 17-bit shift register.  That registers are driven by frequency 1.79&amp;nbsp;MHz for NTSC or 1.77&amp;nbsp;MHz for PAL. Its outputs can by used independently by each audio channels' divider rate.

===AUDCTL $D208 Write===

Audio Control allows the choice of clock input used for the audio channels, control over the high-pass filter feature, merging two channels together allowing 16-bit frequency accuracy, selecting a high frequency clock for specific channels, and control over the "randomness" of the polynomial input.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Bit 7 !! Bit 6 !! Bit 5 !! Bit 4 !! Bit 3 !! Bit 2 !! Bit 1 !! Bit 0
|-
| 17 vs 9 Poly || CH1 1.79 || CH3 1.79 || CH2 + 1 || CH4 + 3 || FI1 + 3 || FI2 + 4 || 64 vs 15kHz 
|}

"1" means "on", if not described:

;Bit 0: $01: (15&amp;nbsp;kHz), choice of frequency divider rate "0" - 64&amp;nbsp;kHz, "1" - 15&amp;nbsp;kHz 1
;Bit 1: $02: (FI2 + 4), high-pass filter for channel 2 rated by frequency of channel 4
;Bit 2: $04: (FI1 + 3), high-pass filter for channel 1 rated by frequency of channel 3
;Bit 3: $08: (CH4 + 3), connection of dividers 4+3 to obtain 16-bit accuracy
;Bit 4: $10: (CH2 + 1), connection of dividers 2+1 to obtain 16-bit accuracy
;Bit 5: $20: (CH3 1.79), set channel 3 frequency "0" is 64 kHz. "1" is 1.79&amp;nbsp;MHz NTSC or 1.77&amp;nbsp;MHz PAL
;Bit 6: $40: (CH1 1.79),  set channel 1 frequency "0" is 64 kHz. "1" is 1.79&amp;nbsp;MHz NTSC or 1.77&amp;nbsp;MHz PAL
;Bit 7: $80: (POLY 9), switch shift register "0" - 17-bit, "1"&amp;nbsp;– 9-bit

All frequency dividers (AUDF) can be driven at the same time by 64&amp;nbsp;kHz or 15&amp;nbsp;kHz rate.

Frequency dividers 1 and 3 can be alternately driven by CPU clock (1.79&amp;nbsp;MHz NTSC, 1.77&amp;nbsp;MHz PAL).
Frequency dividers 2 and 4 can be alternately driven by output of dividers 1 and 3.
In this way, POKEY makes possible connecting of 8-bit channels to create sound with 16-bit accuracy.

Possible channel configurations:
* four 8-bit channels
* two 8-bit channels and one 16-bit channel
* two 16-bit channels

==Potentiometers==
POKEY has eight analog to digital converter ports most commonly used for potentiometers, also known as Paddle Controllers.  The analog inputs are also used for the Touch Tablet controller, and the 12-button,video game Keyboard Controllers.   Each input has a drop transistor, which can be set on or off from software. The timers can also be used to support a [[light pen]], by connecting a [[photodiode]] to the drop transistor, which captures the timer when the electron beam in the television passes by the pen. The vertical position of the pen had to be read separately.

Paddle Controller 7 Input

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Bit 7 !! Bit 6 !! Bit 5 !! Bit 4 !! Bit 3 !! Bit 2 !! Bit 1 !! Bit 0
|-
| ? || ? || ? || ? || ? || ? || ? || ? 
|}

Each input has 8-bit timer, counting time when each TV line is being displayed. This had the added advantage of allowing the value read out to be fed directly into screen coordinates of objects being driven by the paddles.  The Atari Paddle values range from 0 to 228, though the maximum possible is 244.  The Paddle controller reads 0 when turned to its maximum clockwise position, and returns increasing values as it is turned counter-clockwise ending at its maximum value.

The Paddle reading process begins by writing to [[POKEY#POTGO $D20B Write|POTGO]] which resets the POT* values to 0, the [[POKEY#ALLPOT $D208 Read|ALLPOT]] value to $FF, and discharges the potentiometer read capacitors.  The POT* values increment as they are being scanned until reaching the resistance value of the potentiometer.  When the Paddle reading is complete the corresponding bit in [[POKEY#ALLPOT $D208 Read|ALLPOT]] is reset to 0.

The Paddle scanning process can take the majority of a video frame to complete.  The Atari Operating System takes care of Paddle reading automatically. The Paddles are read and paddle scanning initiated during the stage 2 vertical blank.  Paddle values are copied to shadow registers.  (Note that Paddle triggers are actually joystick direction input read from PIA.)

A faster mode of scanning the Paddles is possible by setting a bit in [[POKEY#SKCTL $D20F Write|SKCTL]].  The reading sequence completes in only a couple scan lines, but the value is less accurate.

===ALLPOT $D208 Read===
Potentiometer Scanning Status

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Bit 7 !! Bit 6 !! Bit 5 !! Bit 4 !! Bit 3 !! Bit 2 !! Bit 1 !! Bit 0
|-
| Paddle 7 || Paddle 6 || Paddle 5 || Paddle 4 || Paddle 3 || Paddle 2 || Paddle 1 || Paddle 0
|}

Each bit corresponds to one potentiometer input (the POT* registers).  When paddle scanning is started by writing to [[POKEY#POTGO $D20B Write|POTGO]] each paddle's bit in ALLPOT is set to 1.  When a paddle's scan is complete the corresponding bit in ALLPOT is reset to 0 indicating the value in the  associated POT* register is now valid to read.

===POTGO $D20B Write===
Start Potentiometer Scan

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Bit 7 !! Bit 6 !! Bit 5 !! Bit 4 !! Bit 3 !! Bit 2 !! Bit 1 !! Bit 0
|-
| - || - || - || - || - || - || - || - 
|}

Writing to POTGO initiates the potentiometer (Paddle) scanning process.  This resets the POT* values to 0, the [[POKEY#ALLPOT $D208 Read|ALLPOT]] value to $FF, and discharges the potentiometer read capacitors.  As each potentiometer scan completes the bit corresponding to the potentiometer in [[POKEY#ALLPOT $D208 Read|ALLPOT]] is cleared indicating the value of the associated POT* register is valid for reading.

==Serial input output port==
Contains:
* serial input line
* serial output line
* serial clock output line
* two-way serial clock data line
* registers SKREST, SEROUT, SERIN, SKCTL, SKSTAT

POKEY is a sort of [[UART]]. Usually one of the doubled audio channels is used as baud rate generator. The standard baud rate is 19.2 kbit/s, the maximum possible baud rate is 127 kbit/s. A byte put into the SEROUT register is automatically sent over the serial bus. The data frame contains 10 bits: 1 start bit, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit. The voltage levels are 0&amp;nbsp;V (logical 0) and +4&amp;nbsp;V (logical 1). It is possible to connect the Atari serial port with an RS-232 port by means of a simple voltage converter. 

Each [[input/output]] operation causes POKEY's internal shift registers to change value, so when programming for POKEY, it is necessary to re-initialise some values after each operation is carried out.

===SKREST $D20A Write===
Reset Serial Port Status (SKSTAT).

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Bit 7 !! Bit 6 !! Bit 5 !! Bit 4 !! Bit 3 !! Bit 2 !! Bit 1 !! Bit 0
|-
| - || - || - || - || - || - || - || - 
|}

A write to this register will reset bits 5 through 7 of [[POKEY#SKSTAT $D20F Read|SKSTAT]] which are latches to 1.  The latches flag keyboard overrun, Serial data input overrun, and Serial data input frame error.
 
===SEROUT $D20D Write===
Serial port data output byte.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Bit 7 !! Bit 6 !! Bit 5 !! Bit 4 !! Bit 3 !! Bit 2 !! Bit 1 !! Bit 0
|-
| - || - || - || - || - || - || - || - 
|}

This is a parallel "holding" register for the eight bit (one byte) value that will be transferred to the serial shift register for output one bit at a time.   When the port is ready to accept data for output a Serial Data Out interrupt informs the Operating System that it can write a byte to this output register.

===SERIN $D20D Read===
Serial port data input byte.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Bit 7 !! Bit 6 !! Bit 5 !! Bit 4 !! Bit 3 !! Bit 2 !! Bit 1 !! Bit 0
|-
| - || - || - || - || - || - || - || - 
|}

Like SEROUT, also a parallel "holding" register.  This holds the eight bit (one byte) value assembled by the serial shift register reading the data input one bit at a time.  When a full byte is read a Serial Data In interrupt occurs informing the Operating System that it can read the byte from this register.  

===SKCTL $D20F Write===
Serial Port Control

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Bit 7 !! Bit 6 !! Bit 5 !! Bit 4 !! Bit 3 !! Bit 2 !! Bit 1 !! Bit 0
|-
| Serial Break || Serial Mode2 || Serial Mode1 || Serial Mode0 || Serial Two-Tone || Fast Pot Scan || Enable KB Scan || KB debounce 
|}

Bit 0: Enable "debounce" scanning which is intended to eliminate noise or jitter from mechanical switches.  A value of 1 enables POKEY to use an internal comparison register while scanning keys.  A key must be detected in two simultaneous scans before it is identified as pressed, and it must be seen released for two consecutive scans to be considered released.  This should be enabled to maintain normal keyboard handling with the Operating System.

Bit 1: Set to 1 to enable keyboard scanning.  This should be enabled to maintain normal keyboard handling with the Operating System.

Bit 2: Set to 1 to enable fast, though less accurate Potentiometer scanning.  Fast Pot scanning increments the counter on every cycle and returns a usable result within two scan lines.  The Operating System uses the slow Pot Scanning which increments the counter once every 114 cycles (scan line) taking a frame (1/60th second) to produce a result.  The OS reads the Pot values during the its Vertical Blank Interrupt (VBI) and copies the result to the potentiometer Shadow registers in RAM.  It then resets POTGO for the next read during the next VBI. 

Bit 3: Enable Serial port two-tone mode.  When enabled, 1 and 0 bits output to the SIO bus are replaced by tones set by timers 1 and 2.  This is ordinarily used for writing analog tones representing digital data to cassette tape.

Bit 4-6: Clock Timing Control for serial port operation. Bit values described below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Port Control [6:4] !! Bits Value !! Input Clock !! Output Clock !! Bidirectional Clock
|-
| 0 0 0 ||  $00 || External || External || Input
|-
| 0 0 1 ||  $10 || Channels 3+4 (async) || External || Input 
|-
| 0 1 0 ||  $20 || Channel 4 || Channel 4 || Output Channel 4
|-
| 0 1 1 ||  $30 || Channel 3+4 (async) || Channel 4 (async) || Input
|-
| 1 0 0 ||  $40 || External || Channel 4 || Input
|-
| 1 0 1 ||  $50 || Channel 3+4 (async) || Channel 4 (async) || Input
|-
| 1 1 0 ||  $60 || Channel 4 || Channel 2 || Output Channel 4
|-
| 1 1 1 ||  $70 || Channel 3+4 (async) || Channel 2 || Input
|}

Bit 7: Forces a known 0 output, so that timer 2 can reset timer 1 in two-tone serial output mode.

===SKSTAT $D20F Read===
Serial Port Status

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Bit 7 !! Bit 6 !! Bit 5 !! Bit 4 !! Bit 3 !! Bit 2 !! Bit 1 !! Bit 0
|-

'''Passive daylighting''' is a system of both collecting [[sunlight]] using static, non-moving, and non-tracking systems (such as [[window]]s, [[sliding glass door]]s, most [[skylight]]s, [[light tube]]s) and reflecting the collected [[daylight]] deeper inside with elements such as [[light shelves]]. Passive daylighting systems are different from [[active daylighting]] systems in that active systems track and/or follow the sun, and rely on mechanical mechanisms to do so.

==Collecting==
Collecting devices rely on their position to most effectively capture sunlight.  A [[building]]'s position as well as architectural considerations are critical in the effectiveness of passive daylighting. Passive daylight systems are typically non-mechanical, and optimal [[daylighting]] efficiency is achieved by proper building and system orientation.  A southern facing orientation is optimal if a building or system is located in the [[northern hemisphere]], and a northern facing orientation is optimal if located in the [[southern hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/learning/re_passive_solar.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117213701/http://www.nrel.gov/learning/re_passive_solar.html |date=January 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reflecting==
Reflecting elements such as [[light shelves]], lighter wall colors, [[mirror]]ed wall sections, interior walls with upper glass panels, and clear or translucent glassed hinged [[door]]s and Sliding glass doors take the captured light and passively reflect it further inside. The light can be from passive vertical windows or overhead skylights-tubes or [[active daylighting]] sources. In traditional [[Japanese architecture]] the [[Shōji]] sliding panel doors, with translucent [[washi]] screens, are an original precedent. [[International style (architecture)|International style]], [[Modern architecture|Modernist]] and [[Mid-century modern]] [[architecture]] were earlier innovators of this passive penetration and reflection in industrial, commercial, and residential applications. 

The use of all these passive daylighting methods reduces energy consumption from artificial lighting use, creating a more [[sustainable architecture]]. They are some of the components in designing for [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED - Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] certification. Specifically, designing for daylighting applies to the IEQ credit "Daylighting and Views", and can contribute to the EA credit "Optimize Energy Performance".

'''Pigging''' in the context of [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] refers to the practice of using devices known as "pigs" to perform various maintenance operations. This is done without stopping the flow of the product in the pipeline.

These operations include but are not limited to cleaning and inspecting the pipeline. This is accomplished by inserting the pig into a "pig launcher" (or "launching station")&amp;nbsp;— an oversized section in the pipeline, reducing to the normal diameter. The launching station is then closed and the pressure-driven flow of the product in the pipeline is used to push the pig along down the pipe until it reaches the receiving trap&amp;nbsp;— the "pig catcher" (or "receiving station").

==Applications==
 {{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}} 
Pigging has been used for many years to clean large diameter pipelines in the oil industry. Today, however, the use of smaller diameter pigging systems is now increasing in many continuous and batch process plants as plant operators search for increased efficiencies and reduced costs.

Pigging can be used for almost any section of the transfer process between, for example, blending, storage or filling systems. Pigging systems are already installed in industries handling products as diverse as lubricating oils, paints, chemicals, toiletries, cosmetics and foodstuffs.

Pigs are used in lube oil or paint blending to clean the pipes to avoid cross-contamination, and to empty the pipes into the product tanks (or sometimes to send a component back to its tank). Usually pigging is done at the beginning and at the end of each batch, but sometimes it is done in the midst of a batch, such as when producing a premix that will be used as an intermediate component.

Pigs are also used in oil and gas pipelines to clean the pipes. There are also "smart pigs" used to inspect pipelines for the purpose of preventing leaks, which can be explosive and dangerous to the environment. They usually do not interrupt production, though some product can be lost when the pig is extracted. They can also be used to separate different products in a multiproduct pipeline.

If the pipeline contains [[butterfly valve]]s, or reduced port ball valves, the pipeline cannot be pigged. Full port (or full bore) [[ball valve]]s cause no problems because the inside diameter of the ball opening is the same as that of the pipe.

==Etymology==
Some early cleaning "pigs" were made from straw bales wrapped in barbed wire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Pigs' play crucial role in pipeline maintenance|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/pigs-play-crucial-role-in-pipeline-maintenance-2005-09-09/rep_id:4715/company:fluor-2016-07-04|website=Creamer Media Engineering News|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others used leather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Does Pipeline Pigging Work?|url=http://www.rigzone.com/training/insight.asp?insight_id=310|website=rigzone.com|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both made a squealing noise while traveling through the pipe, sounding to some like a [[pig]] squealing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=That's Some Smart Pig in the Pipeline|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5627707|website=NPR.org|accessdate=21 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which gave pigs their name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rigzone.com/training/insight.asp?insight_id=310&amp;c_id=19|title=How Does Pipeline Pigging Work?|publisher=RIGGZONE.com |date= |accessdate= 2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pipedata.net/store/books/Book04/Book04_TOC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; "PIG" is sometimes claimed as an acronym or [[backronym]] derived from the initial letters of the term "Pipeline Inspection Gauge" or "Pipeline Intervention Gadget".

==In production environments==
===Product and time saving===
A major advantage  for multi-product pipelines of piggable systems is the potential of product savings. At the end of each product transfer, it is possible to clear out the entire line contents with the pig, either forwards to the receipt point, or backwards to the source tank. There is no requirement for extensive line flushing.

Without the need for line flushing, pigging offers the additional advantage of much more rapid and reliable product changeover. Product sampling at the receipt point is faster with pigs, because the interface between products is very clear; the old method of checking at intervals to determine where the product is on-specification takes considerably longer.

Pigging can also be operated totally by a [[programmable logic controller]] (PLC).

===Environmental benefits===
Pigging has a significant role to play in reducing the environmental impact of batch operations. Traditionally, the only way that an operator of a batch process could ensure a product was completely cleared from a line was to flush the line with a cleaning agent such as water or a solvent, or even with the next product. The cleaning agent then had to be subjected to effluent treatment or solvent recovery. If a product was used to clear the line, it was necessary to downgrade or dump the contaminated portion of the product. All of these problems can now be eliminated due to the very precise interface produced by modern pigging systems.

===Safety considerations===
Pigging systems are designed so that the pig is loaded into the launcher, which is pressured to launch the pig into the pipeline through a kicker line. In some cases, the pig is removed from the pipeline via the receiver at the end of each run.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pipingtech.com/products/miscellaneous-fabricated-supports.htm Miscellaneous Fabricated Supports] Piping Technology &amp; Products, (retrieved May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; All systems must allow for the receipt of pigs at the launcher, as blockages in the pipeline may require the pigs to be pushed back to the launcher. Many systems are designed to pig the pipeline in either direction.

The pig is pushed either with a gas or a liquid; if pushed by gas, some systems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://servinox.com/wordpress/index.php/systeme-de-raclage/?lang=en |title=SERVINOX pig speed regulation unit |publisher=servinox.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be adapted in the gas inlet in order to ensure pig's constant speed, whatever the flow pressure is. The pigs must be removed, as many pigs are rented, pigs wear and must be replaced, and cleaning (and other) pigs push contaminants from the pipeline such as wax, foreign objects, hydrates, etc., which must be removed from the pipeline. There are inherent risks in opening the barrel to atmospheric pressure so care must be taken to ensure that the barrel is depressurized prior to opening. If the barrel is not completely depressurized, the pig can be ejected from the barrel and operators have been severely injured when standing in front of an open pig door. A pig was once accidentally shot out of the end of a pipeline without a proper pig receiver and went through the side of a house 500 feet away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wfaa.com/news/investigates/Pipeline-Flying-Pig-crashes-through-Grand-Prairie-home-105387413.html |title=Pipeline 'pig' crashes through Grand Prairie home |publisher=WFAA |first=Brett |last=Shipp |archive-date=2012-08-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829030105/http://www.wfaa.com/news/investigates/Pipeline-Flying-Pig-crashes-through-Grand-Prairie-home-105387413.html|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the product is sour, the barrel should be evacuated to a flare system where the [[sour gas]] is burnt. Operators should wear a [[self-contained breathing apparatus]] when working on sour systems.

A few pigging systems utilize a "captive pig", and the pipeline is only opened occasionally to check the condition of the pig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.piggingsystems.com/pigs.html |title=I.S.T. Molchtechnik GmbH |publisher=Piggingsystems.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413114933/http://www.piggingsystems.com/pigs.html |archivedate=2010-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At all other times, the pig is shuttled up and down the pipeline at the end of each transfer, and the pipeline is never opened up during process operation. These systems are not common.

====Mechanical interlocks====
There are many reports of incidents in which operators have been injured or even killed while performing a pigging operation. Common causes of such events are:
* opening of the closure door while the vessel is still pressurized; 
* opening of the main process valve while the closure door is not fully closed;
* opening of the closure door while a high concentration of H₂S or other toxins remains inside the vessel;
* the vent valve remaining open while the vessel is being pressurized with its medium.

All these causes are directly related to improper operation of the process valves and the closure door. A common method of avoiding these kinds of incidents is to add valve interlocks,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netherlocks.com/products/process-interlocking/ netherlocks.com]&lt;/ref&gt; which has been adopted by all global oil and gas operating companies.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Safety during pigging relies on strict adherence to safety procedures, which give detailed description of a safe valve operating sequence. By physically blocking incorrect operations, valve interlocks enforce such sequences. Valve interlocks are permanently mounted to both manual and motor operated valves and the closure door. The interlocks block operation of a valve or door, unless the appropriate keys are inserted.

The principle of valve interlocking is the transfer of keys. Each lock is equipped with two keys: a key for the locked open position and one for the locked closed position. During an operating procedure, only one key at a time is free. This key only fits in the interlock belonging to the valve that is to be operated next in the operating procedure. All keys are uniquely coded to avoid the possibility that valves can be unlocked at an inappropriate time.

Nowadays intelligent interlocking solutions enable the integration of field devices like pressure or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S meters in a valve interlocking sequence. This increases safety by integrating operator procedures&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netherlocks.com/process-interlocking/the-integration-of-electronic-components-into-mechanical-valve-interlocking-solutions/ netherlocks.com]&lt;/ref&gt; with DCS and SIS safety systems.

== Pig varieties ==
[[Image:PipelinePIG.jpg|thumb|A pig on display in a section of cutaway pipe, from the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System|Alaska Pipeline]]]]
[[Image:Pipeline device.jpg|thumb|right|A pig launcher/receiver, belonging to the natural gas pipeline in Switzerland.]]
A "pig" in the [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] industry is a tool that is sent down a pipeline and propelled by the [[pressure]] of the product flow in the pipeline itself. There are four main uses for pigs:
# Physical separation between different fluids flowing through the pipeline
# Internal cleaning of pipelines
# Inspection of the condition of pipeline walls (also known as an Inline Inspection (ILI) tool)
# Capturing and recording geometric information relating to pipelines (e.g., size, position).

One of the most common and versatile is the foam pig which is cut or poured out of open cell [[polyurethane]] foam into the shape of a bullet and is driven through pipelines for many reasons such as to prove the inner diameter of, clean, de-water, or dry out the line. There are several types of pigs for cleaning in various densities from 2 lb to 10 lb foam and in special applications up to 20 lb. Some have [[tungsten]] [[screw#Bolt|studs]] or abrasive wire mesh on the outside to cut [[rust]], [[fouling|scale]], or [[paraffin wax]] deposits off the inside of the pipe. Other types are fully or criss-cross coated in urethane, or there are bare polyurethane foam pigs with a urethane coating just on the rear to seal and assist in driving the pig. There are also fully molded urethane pigs used for liquid removal or batching several different products in one line.

[[Inline inspection]] pigs use various methods for inspecting a pipeline. A sizing pig uses one (or more) notched round metal plates as gauges. The notches allow different parts of the plate to bend when a bore restriction is encountered. More complex systems exist for inspecting various aspects of the pipeline. Intelligent pigs are used to inspect the pipeline with sensors and record the data for later analysis. These pigs use technologies such as magnetic flux leakage (MFL) and [[ultrasound]] to inspect the pipeline. Intelligent pigs may also use [[caliper]]s to measure the inside geometry of the pipeline.

In 1961, the first intelligent pig was run by Shell Development. It demonstrated that a self-contained electronic instrument could traverse a pipeline while measuring and recording wall thickness. The instrument used electromagnetic fields to sense wall integrity. In 1964 Tuboscope ran the first commercial instrument. It used MFL technology to inspect the bottom portion of the pipeline. The system used a black box similar to those used on aircraft to record the information; it was basically a highly customized analog tape recorder. Until recently, tape recording (although digital) was still the preferred recording medium. As the capacity and reliability of [[Solid-state electronics|solid-state memory]] improved, most recording media moved away from tape to solid-state.

Capacitive sensor probes are used to detect defects in polyethylene pipe gas pipeline. These probes are attached to the pig before it is sent through the polyethylene pipe to detect any defects in the outside of the pipe wall. This is done by using a triple plate capacitive sensor in which electrostatic waves are propagated outward through the pipe's wall. Any change in dielectric material results in a change in capacitance.&lt;ref&gt;http://gradworks.umi.com/14/71/1471527.html&lt;/ref&gt; Testing was conducted by NETL DOE research lab at the Battelle West Jefferson’s Pipeline Simulation Facility
(PSF) near Columbus, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/oil-gas/publications/td/dtrs56-benchmark_report_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intelligent pigging===
[[Image:Pigging-inserting pig into line.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Inserting a pig into a natural gas pipeline]]
Modern intelligent or "smart" pigs are highly sophisticated instruments that include electronics and sensors that collect various forms of data during their trip through the pipeline. They vary in technology and complexity depending on the intended use and the manufacturer.

The electronics are sealed to prevent leakage of the pipeline product into the electronics since products can range from being highly basic to highly acidic and can be of extremely high pressure and temperature. Many pigs use specific materials according to the product in the pipeline. Power for the electronics is typically provided by onboard batteries which are also sealed. Data recording may be by various means ranging from analog tape, digital tape, or solid-state memory in more modern units.

The technology used varies by the service required and the design of the pig, each pigging service provider may have unique and proprietary technologies to accomplish the service. Surface pitting and corrosion, as well as cracks and weld defects in steel/ferrous pipelines are often detected using [[magnetic flux leakage]] (MFL) pigs. Other "smart" pigs use [[electromagnetic acoustic transducer]]s to detect pipe defects.&lt;ref&gt;Stéphane Sainson, ''Inspection en ligne des pipelines. Principes et méthodes''. Ed. Lavoisier. 2007. {{ISBN|978-2743009724}}. 332 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Caliper pigs can measure the [[roundness (object)|roundness]] of the pipeline to determine areas of crushing or other deformations. Some smart pigs use a combination of technologies, such as providing MFL and caliper functions in a single tool. Trials of pigs using [[acoustic resonance technology]] have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gassco.no/en/media/news-archive/New-techonology-revolutionises-gas-pipeline-checks/ Press release from Gassco, 29 May 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the pigging run the pig is unable to directly communicate with the outside world due to the distance underground or underwater and/or the materials that the pipe is made of. For example, steel pipelines effectively prevent any significant radio communications outside the pipe. It is therefore necessary that the pig use internal means to record its own movement during the trip. This may be done by [[odometer]]s, gyroscope-assisted [[tilt sensor]]s and other technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gdengineering.com/hi_t_pigalert.asp PIG Signaller]&lt;/ref&gt; The pig records this positional data so that the distance it moves along with any bends can be interpreted later to determine the exact path taken.

====Location verification====
Location verification is often accomplished by surface instruments that record the pig's passage by either audible, magnetic, radio-transmission or other means. The sensors record when they detect the passage of the pig (time-of-arrival); this is then compared to the internal record for verification or adjustment. The external sensors may have [[Global Positioning System]] capability&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enduropls.com/products/tracking Pig tracking]&lt;/ref&gt; to assist in their location. A few pig passage indicators transmit the pig's passage, time and location, via satellite uplink.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tdwilliamson.com/en/Products/PiggingProducts/Indicators/Documents/PIG_SIG%20NI.pdf Pig Passage Indicator]&lt;/ref&gt; The pig itself cannot use GPS as the metal pipe blocks satellite signals.

After the pigging run has been completed, the positional data from the external sensors is combined with the pipeline evaluation data (corrosion, cracks, etc.) from the pig to provide a location-specific defect map and characterization. In other words, the combined data reveals to the operator the location, type and size of each pipe defect. This information is used to judge the severity of the defect and help repair crews locate and repair the defect quickly without having to dig up excessive amounts of pipeline. By evaluating the rate of change of a particular defect over several years, proactive plans can be made to repair the pipeline before any leakage or environmental damage occurs.

The inspection results are typically archived (perhaps in [[Pipeline Open Data Standard]] format) for comparison with the results of later pigging runs on the same pipeline.

==In popular culture==
A pig has been used as a plot device in three [[James Bond]] films: ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'', where Bond disabled a pig to escape from a pipeline; ''[[The Living Daylights]]'', where a pig was modified to secretly transport a person through the [[Iron Curtain]]; and ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'', where a pig was used to move a nuclear weapon through a pipeline.

A pig was also used as a plot device in the [[Tony Hillerman]] book ''[[The Sinister Pig]]'' where an abandoned pipeline from Mexico to the United States was used with a pig to transport illegal drugs.

A pig launcher was featured in the season 2 episode "Pipeline Fever" of the animated show ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)]]'', wherein [[Sterling Archer]] and [[List of Archer characters#Lana Kane|Lana Kane]] are tasked with going into a swamp and defending a pig launcher from radical environmentalist Joshua Gray.

{{Nihongo|'''Pioneer Corporation'''|パイオニア株式会社|Paionia Kabushiki-kaisha}} commonly referred to as '''Pioneer''', is a [[Japan]]ese [[multinational corporation]] based in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] that specializes in digital entertainment products. The company was founded by [[Nozomu Matsumoto]] in 1938 in [[Tokyo]] as a radio and [[Loudspeaker|speaker]] repair shop, and its current president is Susumu Kotani.

Pioneer played a role in the development of interactive [[cable TV]], the [[Laserdisc|Laser Disc]] player, the first automotive [[compact disc|Compact Disc]] player, the first detachable face car stereo, [[Supertuner]] technology, [[DVD]] and [[DVD recording]], [[plasma display]] (branded as [[Pioneer Kuro|Kuro]]), and [[organic light-emitting diode|Organic LED display]] (OLED). The company works with optical disc and display technology and software products and is also a manufacturer. [[Sharp Corporation]] took a 14% stake in Pioneer in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edn.com/blog/690000269/post/1840014784.html|title=EDN|work=EDN|accessdate=22 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119225050/http://www.edn.com/blog/690000269/post/1840014784.html|archivedate=19 November 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been reduced to 9%, but Sharp still remains the largest shareholder of Pioneer Corporation, followed by [[Honda|Honda Motor Co., Ltd.]] who owns roughly 4% of Pioneer shares following a memorandum between the two companies in 2010 to strengthen business ties.

In March 2010, Pioneer stopped producing televisions as announced on 12 February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.engadget.com/2009/02/12/pioneer-officially-leaving-the-tv-biz-by-march-2010-focusing-on/ |title= Pioneer officially leaving the TV biz by March 2010, focusing on audio |first= Richard| last= Lawler| website= Engadget.com | date= 12 February 2009| accessdate= 25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 25, 2009, Sharp Corporation agreed to form a joint venture on their optical business to be called Pioneer Digital Design and Manufacturing Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url= http://pioneer.jp/press-e/2009/pdf/0625-1.pdf | title= Pioneer and Sharp Sign Contract for Optical Disk Joint Venture| publisher= Pioneer Corporation, Sharp Corporation | date= 25 June 2009| location= Tokyo | website= Pioneer.jp| accessdate= 25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, Pioneer agreed to sell Pioneer Home Electronics (Home A/V) to [[Onkyo]], and in March 2015, Pioneer sold its DJ equipment business division to [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts|KKR]], which resulted in the establishment of Pioneer DJ as a separate entity, independent of Pioneer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2766">'''Sebakh''' ({{lang-ar|سباخ}}, less commonly transliterated as ''sebbakh'') is an [[Arabic]] word that translates to "fertilizer". This term is used to describe decomposed [[organic compound|organic]] material that can be employed both as an [[agricultural]] fertilizer and as a fuel for fires.

==Composition==
Most sebakh consists of ancient, deteriorated mud brick. Mud brick was a primary building material in [[ancient Egypt]]. This material is composed of ancient mud mixed with the [[nitrous]] 
[[compost]] of the [[hay]] and [[Crop residue|stubble]] that the bricks were originally formulated with to give added strength before being baked in the sun.

==Affecting archaeology==
[[File:Luxor temple.JPG|thumb|[[30th Dynasty]] mudbricks excavated in [[Luxor]]. Ancient mudbricks are a common source of ''sebakh'']]
A common practice in Egypt, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, was for farmers to obtain government permits to remove this material from ancient [[mound]]s; such farmers were known as 'sebakhin'. Mounds indicating the location of ancient cities are also known as a ''[[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]'', or ''tel''.

An [[archaeological]] site could provide an excellent source of sebakh because decomposed organic [[debris]] creates a soil very rich in [[nitrogen]]. Nitrogen is an essential component in fertilizers used for plant crops.

Numerous potentially valuable archaeological finds were unfortunately destroyed by farmers in this way. However, sebakh digging also led to the discovery of archaeological finds that might otherwise have gone undetected.

==Amarna==
Sebakh is most commonly associated with the finding of the site of [[Amarna]] (Arabic: العمارنة al-‘amārnä). In 1887, a local inhabitant who was delving into sebakh deposits accidentally discovered more than 300 [[cuneiform]] tablets that turned out to be Pharaonic records of correspondence. These tablet letters, known as the [[Amarna Letters]], have provided much valuable historical and chronological data, as well as information bearing on Egyptian diplomatic relations with her neighbors at that time.

'''Tantangara Dam''' is a major ungated [[Gravity dam|concrete gravity]] [[dam]] with [[Spillway#chute|concrete chute spillway]] across the [[Murrumbidgee River]] upstream of [[Adaminaby, New South Wales|Adaminaby]] in the [[Snowy Mountains]] region of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. The dam is part of the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]], a vast hydroelectricity and irrigation complex constructed in south-east Australia between 1949 and 1974 and now run by [[Snowy Hydro]]. The purpose of the dam includes water management and conservation, with much of the impounded headwaters diverted to [[Lake Eucumbene]]. The impounded [[Reservoir (water)|reservoir]] is called '''Tantangara Reservoir'''.

==Location and features==
Commenced in 1958 and completed in 1960, the Tantangara Dam is located on the Murrumbidgee River, approximately {{convert|6|km}} downstream of its [[confluence]] with Gurrangorambla Creek and is wholly within the [[Kosciuszko National Park]]. Her Royal Highness [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra of Kent]] visited the dam in 1959, during its construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=18907|title=HRH Princess Alexandra of Kent visits the Snowy Mountains Scheme, 1959|date=28 September 1959|accessdate=3 May 2013|work=Manuscripts, Oral History and Picture|publisher=[[State Library of New South Wales]]|author=Australian Photographic Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dam was constructed by Utah-Brown &amp; Root Sudamericana on behalf of the [[Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority]], and is now managed by Snowy Hydro Limited. The concrete gravity dam of {{convert|73800|m3}} is {{convert|45|m|ft}} high with a crest length of {{convert|216|m|ft}}. At 100% capacity, the dam wall holds back {{convert|254099|ML}} of water. The surface area of Tantangara Reservoir is {{convert|2117.7|ha}} and the catchment area is {{convert|460|km2}}. The spillway across the Murrumbidgee River is capable of discharging {{convert|900|m3/s}}.&lt;ref name=ancold&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancold.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Dams-Australia-2010-v1-for-website.xls|format=Excel (requires download)|title=Register of Large Dams in Australia|publisher=The Australian National Committee on Large Dams Incorporated|year=2010|accessdate=2 May 2013|work=Dams information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water flows 16.6 km from Tantangara Reservoir  to Lake Eucumbene via the 3.1 to 3.35m diameter Murrumbidgee-Eucumbene tunnel falling 40 m in the process. Flow is controlled by a 1.83 x 2.13 m regulating gate such that a maximum of 20 cumecs is allowed. Flow downstream into the Murrumbidgee River is controlled at the dam and comprises two {{convert|2.13|m}} by {{convert|3.05|m}} high shafts, from the outlet works tower and tapering to {{convert|2.13|m}} diameter before passing through a {{convert|1.50|m}} diameter nozzle to river diversion tunnel, with a capacity of
{{convert|70.8|m3/s}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Schedule 2: Water Management Works|title=Snowy Water Licence|date=4 October 2011|page=45|url=http://www.water.nsw.gov.au/ArticleDocuments/35/utilities_snowy_lic_snowy_water_licence_october2011.pdf.aspx|format=PDF|accessdate=8 May 2013|publisher=New South Wales Office of Water|work=Water licensing: Snowy Hydro Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water flows===
====Environmental Water====
The Snowy Water Initiative (SWI) is an agreement for water recovery and environmental flows between the NSW, Victorian and Australian Governments, and Snowy Hydro Limited (SHL) which is set out in the Snowy Water Inquiry Outcomes Implementation Deed 2002 (SWIOID 2002).  The SWI provides three main environmental water programs as part of rebalancing the impacts of the Snowy Hydro Scheme on montane rivers.  These three programs are increased flows for: (i) Snowy River, (ii) River Murray, and (iii) Snowy Montane Rivers.
&lt;ref&gt; Williams (2017) Ecological process: the basis for flow based river rehabilitation in the Snowy Montane Rivers, 2017-18|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316739410_Ecological_process_the_basis_for_flow_based_river_rehabilitation_in_the_Snowy_Montane_Rivers &lt;/ref&gt;
The Snowy Montane River Increased Flows (SMRIF) program identifies five montane rivers to receive environmental water.  The water availability for SMRIF is linked to the water availability for Snowy River Increased Flows (SRIF) (Williams 2017), which is determined by the water recovery in the western rivers and the preceding climatic conditions.  The SWIOID 2002 provides for SHL to forego up to 150 Giga Watt hours (GWHrs) of electricity generation to allow for environmental releases to be made to SMRIF.  This value of 150 GWHrs is converted into a volumetric allocation, but the conversion factor differs depending on the location of the releases in the Snowy Mountains Scheme, and thus influence the overall volume released.  In some locations water released can be re-used to generate electricity so a smaller conversion factor is applied (SWIOID 2002), however, where water is lost to the Snowy Scheme a higher conversion factor is applied.&lt;ref name="Williams 2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=S|title=Ecological process: the basis for flow based river rehabilitation in the Snowy Montane Rivers, 2017-18|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316739410_Ecological_process_the_basis_for_flow_based_river_rehabilitation_in_the_Snowy_Montane_Rivers_2017-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Releases to the Murrumbidgee River are made from Tantangara dam, a much larger structure than the other release points, for which a gated release structure is available.  Accordingly, the daily flow release strategy for the Murrumbidgee River differs from the other SMRIF release points.&lt;ref name="Williams 2017"/&gt;
 
The releases comprise two components: (i) the SMRIF and (ii) a Base Passing Flow (BPF).  The BPF has some key components, these being:
* A 2GL year volume is targeted over the longer term.
* A 32 ML/day discharge is to be targeted at Mittagang Crossing, near Cooma.
* A maximum of 3.5GL is set for any one year.&lt;ref name="Williams 2017"/&gt;

The Base Passing Flow releases typically occur during drier weather.&lt;ref name="Williams 2017"/&gt;

A modified ‘flow scaling’ approach used to set SRIF releases to the Snowy River has also been applied to the SMRIF in the Murrumbidgee River (&lt;ref&gt;Williams S. (2014) Strategy for the Snowy Montane Rivers Increased Flows 2014-15. NSW Government, Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt;; &lt;ref&gt;Williams S. (2015) Strategy for the Snowy Montane Rivers Increased Flows 2015-16. NSW Government, Sydney.5&lt;/ref&gt;; &lt;ref&gt;Williams S. (2016) Strategy for the Snowy Montane Rivers Increased Flows 2016-17. NSW Government, Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt;; &lt;ref&gt;Williams S. (2017) Ecological process: the basis for flow based river rehabilitation in the Snowy Montane Rivers. NSW Government, Sydney &lt;/ref&gt;).  This modified approach uses the recorded flows in a nearby natural catchment (in a year where similar volumes of flow occurred) to set daily releases.  For releases to the Murrumbidgee River from Tantangara dam, the initial daily flow targets were set using the flow sequence for the Murrumbidgee River above Tantangara (station No. 410535). Daily targets are then amended to account for operational implementation.&lt;ref name="Williams 2017"/&gt; 

The SWIOID 2002 identifies a target of 27GL (i.e. 30% of the Mean Annual Natural Flow- MANF) in a full allocation scenario.  Since 2005-06, environmental water has been released to the Upper Murrumbidgee River to repair the condition of the river. Over the period 2005 to 2018, an average of 17.7GL/year of environmental water has been released to the upper Murrumbidgee River.  The annual allocation varied between 4 GL/ year during the drought and 42.3 GL /year once sufficient water had been recovered.&lt;ref name="Williams 2017"/&gt;

The environmental water portfolio does not allow for environmental water to be released everyday of the year from Tantangara Dam.  Over the period 2005 to 2018, various environmental flow strategies have attempted to re-instate a winter-spring montane flow pattern.  These approaches have attempted to improve instream habitat and ecological processes as the basis for river recovery, rather than the traditional Australian e-water approach of managing rarity of aquatic biota. 

A 2011 report by the Snowy Scientific Committee stated that the Tantangara Dam was starving the upper Murrumbidgee River of environmental water flows from the Snowy Mountains; needed to restore river health. The committee claimed that there was an apparent "administrative and managerial void", with no river management strategy and no proper monitoring because of a lack of regulatory resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/water-issues/murrumbidgee-starved-because-of-manmade-drought--report-20110207-1ak9n.html#ixzz2SDwFQ8qw|title=Murrumbidgee starved because of man-made drought - report|last=Jopson|first=Debra|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=8 February 2011|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''teleprinter''' ('''teletypewriter''', '''Teletype''' or '''TTY''') is an [[electromechanical typewriter]] that can be used to send and receive typed messages through various communications channels, in both [[point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] and [[point-to-multipoint communication|point-to-multipoint]] configurations. The machines were adapted to provide a [[user interface]] to early [[mainframe computer]]s and [[minicomputer]]s, sending typed data to the computer and printing the response. Some models could also be used to create [[punched tape]] for [[Computer data storage|data storage]] (either from typed input or from data received from a remote source) and to read back such tape for local printing or transmission.

Teleprinters could use a variety of different communication media. These included a simple pair of wires; dedicated non-switched telephone circuits (leased lines); [[switched communication network|switched networks]] that operated similarly to the [[public telephone network]] ([[telex]]); and radio and [[microwave]] links (telex-on-radio, or TOR). A teleprinter attached to a [[modem]] could also communicate through standard switched public telephone lines. This latter configuration was often used to connect teleprinters to remote computers, particularly in [[time-sharing]] environments.

Teleprinters have largely been replaced by fully electronic [[computer terminal]]s which typically have a [[computer monitor]] instead of a printer (though the term "TTY" is still occasionally used to refer to them, such as in [[Unix]] systems). Teleprinters are still widely used in the aviation industry (see [[Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Network|AFTN]] and [[airline teletype system]]), and variations called [[Telecommunications device for the deaf|Telecommunications Devices for the Deaf]] (TDDs) are used by the [[hearing loss|hearing impaired]] for typed communications over ordinary telephone lines.

==History==
The teleprinter evolved through a series of inventions by a number of engineers, including [[Samuel Morse]], [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]], [[Royal Earl House]], [[David Edward Hughes]], [[Emile Baudot]], [[Donald Murray (inventor)|Donald Murray]], [[Charles L. Krum]], [[Edward Kleinschmidt]] and [[Frederick G. Creed]]. Teleprinters were invented in order to send and receive messages without the need for operators trained in the use of Morse code. A system of two teleprinters, with one operator trained to use a typewriter, replaced two trained Morse code operators. The teleprinter system improved message speed and delivery time, making it possible for messages to be flashed across a country with little manual intervention.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;{{Citation| title = Typewriter May Soon Be Transmitter of Telegrams
| newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = January 25, 1914| url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1914/01/25/100081424.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1835 [[Samuel Morse]] devised a recording telegraph, and [[Morse code]] was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/co32957/type-used-for-original-morse-telegraph-1835-movable-type|title=Type used for original morse telegraph, 1835|website=[[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-05|quote=Samuel Morse was one of the pioneers of electric telegraphy. Prompted by receiving news of his wife's death too late to attend her funeral, Morse was determined to improve the speed of long distance communications (which at that point relied on horse messengers). Morse invented an instrument that used a current to displace an electro-magnet, which moved a marker, therefore recording the breaks in the current - the invention of Morse Code.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1841 [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]] devised a printing telegraph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://distantwriting.co.uk/bain.html|title=Distant Writing - Bain|author=Steven Roberts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1846, the [[Samuel Morse|Morse]] telegraph service was operational between Washington, D.C., and New York. [[Royal Earl House]] patented his [[printing telegraph]] that same year. He linked two 28-key piano-style keyboards by wire. Each piano key represented a letter of the alphabet and when pressed caused the corresponding letter to print at the receiving end. A "shift" key gave each main key two optional values. A 56-character typewheel at the sending end was synchronised to coincide with a similar wheel at the receiving end. If the key corresponding to a particular character was pressed at the home station, it actuated the typewheel at the distant station just as the same character moved into the printing position, in a way similar to the [[daisy wheel printer]]. It was thus an example of a synchronous data transmission system. House's equipment could transmit around 40 instantly readable words per minute, but was difficult to manufacture in bulk. The printer could copy and print out up to 2,000 words per hour. This invention was first put in operation and exhibited at the [[Mechanics Institute]] in New York in 1844.

Landline teleprinter operations began in 1849, when a circuit was put in service between Philadelphia and New York City.&lt;ref&gt;''RTTY Journal'' Vol. 25 No. 9, October 1977: 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1855, [[David Edward Hughes]] introduced an improved machine built on the work of Royal Earl House. In less than two years, a number of small telegraph companies, including [[Western Union]] in early stages of development, united to form one large corporation – Western Union Telegraph Co. – to carry on the business of telegraphy on the Hughes system.&lt;ref name="Clarkson"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html | title = David Edward Hughes | accessdate =September 29, 2010 | date = April 14, 2007 | publisher = Clarkson University | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080422072443/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html | archivedate = April 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, [[Émile Baudot]] designed in 1874 a system using a five-unit code, which began to be used extensively in that country from 1877. The British Post Office adopted the Baudot system for use on a simplex circuit between London and Paris in 1897, and subsequently made considerable use of duplex Baudot systems on their Inland Telegraph Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hobbs  |first=Alan G. |title=Five-unit codes|url=http://www.nadcomm.com/fiveunit/fiveunits.htm| accessdate =May 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1901, Baudot's code was modified by [[Donald Murray (inventor)|Donald Murray]] (1865–1945, originally from New Zealand), prompted by his development of a typewriter-like keyboard. The Murray system employed an intermediate step, a keyboard perforator, which allowed an operator to punch a [[paper tape]], and a tape transmitter for sending the message from the punched tape. At the receiving end of the line, a printing mechanism would print on a paper tape, and/or a reperforator could be used to make a perforated copy of the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Foster |first=Maximilian |date=August 1901 |title=A Successful Printing Telegraph |magazine=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=II |pages=1195–1199 |id= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IF6tNZnhO7wC&amp;pg=PA1195|accessdate=July 9, 2009 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As there was no longer a direct correlation between the operator's hand movement and the bits transmitted, there was no concern about arranging the code to minimize operator fatigue, and instead Murray designed the code to minimize wear on the machinery, assigning the code combinations with the fewest punched holes to the most [[letter frequencies|frequently used characters]]. The Murray code also introduced what became known as "format effectors" or "[[control character]]s" – the [[Carriage return|CR]] (Carriage Return) and [[Newline|LF]] (Line Feed) codes. A few of Baudot's codes moved to the positions where they have stayed ever since: the NULL or BLANK and the DEL code. NULL/BLANK was used as an idle code for when no messages were being sent.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt;

In the United States in 1902, electrical engineer Frank Pearne approached [[Joy Morton]], head of [[Morton Salt]], seeking a sponsor for research into the practicalities of developing a [[printing telegraph]] system. Joy Morton needed to determine whether this was worthwhile and so consulted mechanical engineer [[Charles L. Krum]], who was vice president of the Western Cold Storage Company. Krum was interested in helping Pearne, so space was set up in a laboratory in the attic of Western Cold Storage. Frank Pearne lost interest in the project after a year and left to get involved in teaching. Krum was prepared to continue Pearne’s work, and in August, 1903 a patent was filed for a 'typebar page printer'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

In 1908, a working teleprinter was produced by the Morkrum Company, called the Morkrum Printing Telegraph, which was field tested with the Alton Railroad. In 1910, the Morkrum Company designed and installed the first commercial teletypewriter system on Postal Telegraph Company lines between Boston and New York City using the "Blue Code Version" of the Morkrum Printing Telegraph.&lt;ref name="Colin Hempstead, William E.

In 1916, [[Edward Kleinschmidt]] filed a patent application for a typebar page printer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = KLEINSCHMIDT | first = E. | title = TELEGRAPH PRINTER | publisher = USPO | date = Apr 14, 1916 | url = http://www.google.com/patents?id=QDRVAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=1448750 | accessdate =July 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, shortly after the [[Morkrum]] company obtained their patent for a start-stop synchronizing method for code telegraph systems, which made possible the practical teleprinter, Kleinschmidt filed an application titled "Method of and Apparatus for Operating Printing Telegraphs"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = KLEINSCHMIDT | first = E. | title = METHOD OF AND APPARATUS FOR OPERATING PRINTING TELEGRAPHS | publisher = USPO | date = May 1, 1919 | url = http://www.google.com/patents?id=lzlKAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=1463136 | accessdate =July 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included an improved start-stop method.&lt;ref name=historytelcom&gt;{{cite book | last = Huurdeman | first = Anton A. | title = The Worldwide History of Telecommunications | publisher = Wiley-IEEE | year = 2003 | pages = 302 | url = | id = | isbn = 0-471-20505-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic start-stop procedure, however, is much older than the Kleinschmidt and Morkrum inventions. It was already proposed by D'Arlincourt in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Deckert |first1=Jürgen |last2=Kösling |first2=Heinz |date=1987 |title=Fernschreibtechnik |trans-title=Teletype Technology |url= |language=German |location=Berlin |publisher=Militärverlag der [[East Germany|Deutschen Demokratischen Republik]] ([[Volkseigener Betrieb|VEB]])|isbn=3-327-00307-6 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of wasting time and money in patent disputes on the start-stop method, Kleinschmidt and the Morkrum Company decided to merge and form the [[Morkrum-Kleinschmidt]] Company in 1924. The new company combined the best features of both their machines into a new typewheel printer for which Kleinschmidt, Howard Krum, and Sterling Morton jointly obtained a patent.&lt;ref name=historytelcom/&gt;

In 1924 Britain's [[Creed &amp; Company]], founded by [[Frederick G. Creed]], entered the teleprinter field with their Model 1P, a page printer, which was soon superseded by the improved Model 2P. In 1925 Creed acquired the patents for Donald Murray's Murray code, a rationalised Baudot code. The Model 3 tape printer, Creed’s first combined start-stop machine, was introduced in 1927 for the Post Office telegram service. This machine printed received messages directly on to gummed paper tape at a rate of 65 words per minute. Creed created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the [[Daily Mail]] for daily transmission of the newspaper's contents. The Creed Model 7 page printing teleprinter was introduced in 1931 and was used for the inland [[Telex]] service. It worked at a speed of 50 baud, about 66 words a minute, using a code based on the Murray code.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

A Teletype system was installed in the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] Flight Service Station Airway Radio Stations system in 1928, carrying administrative messages, flight information and weather reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atchistory.org/History/fsshist.htm|title= Flight Service History 1920-1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1938, the FAA's Teletype network, handling weather traffic, extended over 20,000 miles, covering all 48 states except Maine, New Hampshire, and South Dakota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/media/b-chron.pdf|title=FAA HISTORICAL CHRONOLOGY, 1926-1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ways in which teleprinters were used==
There were at least five major types of teleprinter networks:
* Exchange systems such as [[Telex]] and [[Telex#Teletypewriter eXchange|TWX]]. These created a real-time circuit between two machines, so that anything typed on one machine appeared at the other end immediately. US and UK systems had actual telephone dials, and prior to 1981 five U.S. [[area codes]] were reserved for teletype use; German systems did "dialing" via the keyboard. Typed "chat" was possible, but because billing was by connect time, it was common to prepare messages on [[Punched tape|paper tape]] and transmit them without pauses for typing.
* [[Leased line]] and [[radioteletype]] networks arranged in point-to-point and / or multipoint configurations to support [[data processing]] applications for government and industry such as integrating the accounting, billing, management, production, purchasing, sales, shipping and receiving departments within an organization to speed internal communications.
* [[Message switching]] systems. This was an early form of E-mail, done with electromechanical gear. See [[Telegram]], [[Western Union]], [[Plan 55-A]]. Military organizations had similar but separate systems. See [[Autodin]].
* Broadcast systems such as weather information distribution and "news wires". See [[Associated Press]], [[National Weather Service]], [[Reuters]], and United Press (later [[UPI]]). News was received on receive-only teleprinters, without keyboards or dials.
* "Loop" systems, where anything typed on any machine on the loop printed on all the machines. Police departments used such systems to interconnect precincts. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Teleprinter operation==
[[Image:Baudotkeyboard.png|right|frame|422px|[[Alphanumeric keyboard|Keyboard]] of a [[Baudot code|Baudot Teletype]], with 32 keys, including the space bar]]
[[File:US_Navy_5-Unit_TTY_Code.png|thumb|The U.S. navy 5-unit teleteypwriter (TTY) code used for automated radioteletypewriter (RATT) communications. This is the ITA2 version of the Baudot–Murray code.]]
Most teleprinters used the 5-[[bit]] [[International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2]] (ITA2). This limited the character set to 32 codes (2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = 32). One had to use a "FIGS" (for "figures") [[shift key]] to type numbers and special characters. Special versions of teleprinters had FIGS characters for specific applications, such as weather symbols for weather reports. Print quality was poor by modern standards. The ITA2 code was used [[asynchronous start-stop|asynchronously with start and stop bits]]: the asynchronous code design was intimately linked with the start-stop electro-mechanical design of teleprinters. (Early systems had used synchronous codes, but were hard to synchronize mechanically). Other codes, such as [[FIELDATA]] and [[Flexowriter]], were introduced but never became as popular as ITA2.

''Mark'' and ''space'' are terms describing [[logic level]]s in teleprinter circuits. The native mode of communication for a teleprinter is a simple series [[direct current circuit|DC circuit]] that is interrupted, much as a [[rotary dial]] interrupts a telephone signal. The marking condition is when the circuit is closed (current is flowing), the spacing condition is when the circuit is open (no current is flowing). The "idle" condition of the circuit is a continuous marking state, with the start of a character signalled by a "start bit", which is always a space. Following the start bit, the character is represented by a fixed number of bits, such as 5 bits in the ITA2 code, each either a mark or a space to denote the specific character or machine function. After the character's bits, the sending machine sends one or more stop bits. The stop bits are marking, so as to be distinct from the subsequent start bit. If the sender has nothing more to send, the line simply remains in the marking state (as if a continuing series of stop bits) until a later space denotes the start of the next character. The time between characters need not be an integral multiple of a bit time, but it must be at least the minimum number of stop bits required by the receiving machine.

When the line is broken, the continuous spacing (open circuit, no current flowing) causes a receiving teleprinter to cycle continuously, even in the absence of stop bits. It prints nothing because the characters received are all zeros, the ITA2 blank (or [[ASCII]]) [[null character]].

Teleprinter circuits were generally leased from a communications [[common carrier]] and consisted of ordinary [[telephone cable]]s that extended from the teleprinter located at the customer location to the common carrier [[telephone exchange|central office]]. These teleprinter circuits were connected to switching equipment at the central office for [[Telex]] and [[Telegraphy#TWX|TWX]] service. [[Private line]] teleprinter circuits were not directly connected to switching equipment. Instead, these private line circuits were connected to [[network hub]]s and [[repeater]]s configured to provide point to point or point to multipoint service. More than two teleprinters could be connected to the same wire circuit by means of a [[current loop]].

Earlier teleprinters had three rows of keys and only supported upper case letters. They used the 5 bit ITA2 code and generally worked at 60 to 100 words per minute. Later teleprinters, specifically the [[Teletype Model 33]], used ASCII code, an innovation that came into widespread use in the 1960s as computers became more widely available.

"Speed", intended to be roughly comparable to [[words per minute]], is the standard term introduced by [[Western Union]] for a mechanical teleprinter data transmission rate using the 5-bit ITA2 code that was popular in the 1940s and for several decades thereafter. Such a machine would send 1 start bit, 5 data bits, and 1.42 stop bits. This unusual stop bit time is actually a rest period to allow the mechanical printing mechanism to synchronize in the event that a garbled signal is received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samhallas.co.uk/repository/telegraph/introduction_to_RTTY.pdf |title= Introduction to RTTY}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is true especially on [[High frequency]] radio circuits where selective fading is present. Selective fading causes the mark signal amplitude to be randomly different from the space signal amplitude. Selective fading, or [[Rayleigh fading]] can cause two carriers to randomly and independently fade to different depths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w7ay.net/site/Technical/RTTY%20Demodulators/index.html |title= RTTY Demodulators}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since modern computer equipment cannot easily generate 1.42 bits for the stop period, common practice is to either approximate this with 1.5 bits, or to send 2.0 bits while accepting 1.0 bits receiving.

For example, a "60 speed" machine is geared at 45.5 [[baud]] (22.0 [[millisecond|ms]] per bit), a "66 speed" machine is geared at 50.0 [[baud]] (20.0 ms per bit), a "75 speed" machine is geared at 56.9 baud (17.5 ms per bit), a "100 speed" machine is geared at 74.2 baud (13.5 ms per bit), and a "133 speed" machine is geared at 100.0 baud (10.0 ms per bit). 60 speed became the ''de facto'' standard for [[amateur radio]] [[radioteletype|RTTY]] operation because of the widespread availability of equipment at that speed and the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) restrictions to only 60 speed from 1953 to 1972. Telex, [[news agency]] wires and similar services commonly used 66 speed services. There was some migration to 75 and 100 speed as more reliable devices were introduced. However, the limitations of HF transmission such as excessive error rates due to multipath distortion and the nature of ionospheric propagation kept many users at 60 and 66 speed. Most Teletype audio recordings in existence today are of teleprinters operating at 60 words per minute, and mostly of the Teletype Model 15.

Another measure of the speed of a Teletype machine was in total "operations per minute (OPM)". For example, 60 speed was usually 368 OPM, 66 speed was 404 OPM, 75 speed was 460 OPM, and 100 speed was 600 OPM. Western Union Telexes were usually set at 390 OPM, with 7.0 total bits instead of the customary 7.42 bits.

Both wire-service and private teleprinters had bells to signal important incoming messages and could ring 24/7 while the power was turned on. For example, ringing 4 bells on UPI wire-service machines meant an "Urgent" message; 5 bells was a "Bulletin"; and 10 bells was a FLASH, used only for very important news, such as the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]].

The teleprinter circuit was often linked to a 5-bit [[punched tape|paper tape]] punch (or "reperforator") and reader, allowing messages received to be resent on another circuit. Complex military and commercial communications networks were built using this technology. Message centers had rows of teleprinters and large racks for paper tapes awaiting transmission. Skilled operators could read the priority code from the hole pattern and might even feed a "FLASH PRIORITY" tape into a reader while it was still coming out of the punch. Routine traffic often had to wait hours for relay. Many teleprinters had built-in paper tape readers and punches, allowing messages to be saved in machine-readable form and edited [[off-line]].

Communication by radio, known as ''[[radioteletype]]'' or ''RTTY'' (pronounced ''ritty''), was also common, especially among military users. Ships, command posts (mobile, stationary, and even airborne) and logistics units took advantage of the ability of operators to send reliable and accurate information with a minimum of training. [[Amateur radio]] operators continue to use this mode of communication today, though most use computer-interface sound generators, rather than legacy hardware teleprinter equipment.  Numerous modes are in use within the "ham radio" community, from the original ITA2 format to more modern, faster modes, which include error-checking of characters.

===Control characters===
{{Main|Control character}}
A typewriter or electromechanical printer can print characters on paper, and execute operations such as move the carriage back to the left margin of the same line ([[carriage return]]), advance to the same column of the next line ([[line feed]]), and so on. Commands to control non-printing operations were transmitted in exactly the same way as printable characters by sending control characters with defined functions (e.g., the ''line feed'' character forced the carriage to move to the same position on the next line) to teleprinters. In modern computing and communications a few control characters, such as carriage return and line feed, have retained their original functions (although they are often implemented in software rather than activating electromechanical mechanisms to move a physical printer carriage) but many others are no longer required and are used for other purposes.

===Answer back mechanism===
Some teleprinters had a "Here is" key, which transmitted a fixed sequence of 20 or 22 characters, programmable by breaking tabs off a drum. This sequence could also be transmitted automatically upon receipt of an [[ENQ]] (control E) signal, if enabled.&lt;ref name="Hereis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pdp8.net/asr33/pics/main_back.shtml |title=ASR 33 Teletype Rear View of Main Assembly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AnotherHereis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.k7tty.com/development/teletype/model-32/index.html |title=Teletype Model 32ASR}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was commonly used to identify a station; the operator could press the key to send the station identifier to the other end, or the remote station could trigger its transmission by sending the ENQ character, essentially asking "who are you?"

===Kleinschmidt Labs===
In 1931 Edward Kleinschmidt formed [[Kleinschmidt Inc|Kleinschmidt Labs]] to pursue a different type design of Teletype. In 1944 Kleinschmidt demonstrated their lightweight unit to the Signal Corps and in 1949 their design was adopted for the Army's portable needs. In 1956, Kleinschmidt Labs merged with [[Smith-Corona]], which then merged with the [[Marchant Calculator|Marchant Calculating Machine Co.]], forming the SCM Corporation. By 1979, the Kleinschmidt division was branching off into Electronic Data Interchange, a business in which they became very successful, and replaced the mechanical products, including teleprinters.

Kleinschmidt machines, with the military as their primary customer, used standard military designations for their machines. The teleprinter was identified with designations such as a TT-4/FG, while communication "sets" to which a teleprinter might be a part generally used the standard Army/Navy designation system such as AN/FGC-25. This includes Kleinschmidt teleprinter TT-117/FG and tape reperforator TT-179/FG.

===Teletype Corporation===
{{main|Teletype Corporation}}
The '''Teletype Corporation''', a part of [[AT&amp;T Corporation|American Telephone and Telegraph Company]]'s [[Western Electric]] manufacturing arm since 1930, was founded in 1906 as the Morkrum Company. In 1925, a merger between Morkrum and Kleinschmidt Electric Company created the Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Company. The name was changed in December 1928 to Teletype Corporation. In 1930, Teletype Corporation was purchased by the [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] and became a subsidiary of [[Western Electric]]. In 1984, the divestiture of the Bell System resulted in the Teletype name and logo being replaced by the AT&amp;T name and logo, eventually resulting in the brand being extinguished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kekatos.com/teletype/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603235022/http://www.kekatos.com/teletype/ |title=History of The Teletype Corporation|accessdate=March 3, 2010|archivedate=June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last vestiges of what had been the Teletype Corporation ceased in 1990, bringing to a close the dedicated teleprinter business. Despite its long-lasting trademark status, the word ''Teletype'' went into common generic usage in the news and telecommunications industries. Records of the United States Patent and Trademark Office indicate the trademark has expired and is considered dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/process/search/|title=Search trademark database|first=|last=Trademarks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teletype machines tended to be large, heavy, and extremely robust, capable of running non-stop for months at a time if properly lubricated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/teletype/138_Model15_Adj_Oct41.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitsavers.org%2Fpdf%2Fteletype%2F138_Model15_Adj_Oct41.pdf&amp;date=2010-12-05 | archivedate=December 5, 2010 | title=Adjustments, Type Bar Page Printer, (Model 15) |year=1941 |publisher=Teletype Corporation | location=Chicago }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Model 15 stands out as one of a few machines that remained in production for many years. It was introduced in 1930 and remained in production until 1963, a total of 33 years of continuous production. Very few complex machines can match that record. The production run was stretched somewhat by World War II—the Model 28 was scheduled to replace the Model 15 in the mid-1940s, but Teletype built so many factories to produce the Model 15 during World War II, it was more economical to continue mass production of the Model 15. The Model 15, in its receive only, no keyboard, version was the classic "news Teletype" for decades.
* Model 15 = Baudot version, 45 Baud, optional tape punch and reader
* [[Teletype Model 28|Model 28]] = Baudot version, 45-50-56-75 Baud, optional tape punch and reader
* Model 32 = small lightweight machine (cheap production) 45-50-56-75 Baud, optional tape punch and reader
* [[Teletype Model 33|Model 33]] = same as Model 32 but for 8 level ASCII-plus-parity-bit, used as computer terminal, optional tape punch and reader
* Model 35 = same as Model 28 but for 8 level ASCII-plus-parity-bit, used as heavy-duty computer terminal, optional tape punch and reader
* Model 37 = improved version of the Model 35, higher speeds up to 150 Baud, optional tape punch and reader
* Model 38 = similar to Model 33, but for 132 char./line paper (14 inches wide), optional tape punch and reader
* Model 40 = new system processor based, w/ monitor screen, but mechanical "chain printer"
* Model 42 = new cheap production Baudot machine to replace Model 28 and Model 32, paper tape acc.
* Model 43 = same but for 8 level ASCII-plus-parity-bit, to replace Model 33 and Model 35, paper tape acc.

Several different high-speed printers like the "Ink-tronic" etc.

==Telex==
{{main|Telex|Telegraphy#Teleprinters{{!}}Telegraphy#Telex}}
&lt;!-- Note: Do not drop the sub-item ==Telex== unless you update the links to it. There is at least one item that points to Telex using Teleprinter#Telex as the link. (probably should be redirected to telegraphy--agr) --&gt;
A global teleprinter network, called the "[[Telegraphy#Teleprinters|Telex network]]", was developed in the late 1920s, and was used through most of the 20th century for business communications. The main difference from a standard teleprinter is that Telex includes a switched routing network, originally based on pulse-telephone dialing, which in the United States was provided by Western Union. AT&amp;T developed a competing network called "[[Telegraphy#TWX|TWX]]" which initially also used rotary dialing and Baudot code, carried to the customer premises as pulses of DC on a metallic copper pair. TWX later added a second ASCII-based service using [[Bell 103 modem|Bell 103]] type modems served over lines whose physical interface was identical to regular telephone lines. In many cases, the TWX service was provided by the same telephone central office that handled voice calls, using class of service to prevent [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] customers from connecting to TWX customers. Telex is still in use in some countries for certain applications such as shipping, news, weather reporting and military command. Many business applications have moved to the Internet as most countries have discontinued telex/TWX services.

==Teletypesetter==
In addition to the 5-bit Baudot code and the much later seven-bit ASCII code, there was a six-bit code known as the Teletypesetter code (TTS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/od/pstartinventions/a/printing.htm The History of Printing and Printing Processes], retrieved 2008 July 15&lt;/ref&gt; used by news wire services. It was first demonstrated in 1928 and began to see widespread use in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Sloan"&gt;{{cite book|title=American Journalism: History, Principles, Practices|editor= W. David Sloan, Lisa Mullikin Parcell | page=365 | publisher=McFarland |date=April 10, 2002 |isbn=978-0-7864-1371-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of "shift in" and "shift out" codes, this six-bit code could represent a full set of upper and lower case characters, digits, symbols commonly used in newspapers, and typesetting instructions such as "flush left" or "center", and  even "auxiliary font", to switch to italics or bold type, and back to roman ("upper rail")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/LinotypeHandbookForTeletypesetterOperation1951|title=The Linotype Handbook for Teletypesetter Operation|last=Mergenthaler Linotype Company|date=1951|publisher=digital reprint by www.CircuitousRoot.com|others=Dr. David M. MacMillan|language=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The TTS produces aligned text, taking into consideration character widths and column width, or line length.

A Model 20 Teletype machine with a paper tape punch ("reperforator") was installed at subscriber newspaper sites. Originally these machines would simply punch paper tapes and these tapes could be read by a tape reader attached to a "Teletypesetter operating unit" installed on a [[Linotype machine]]. The "operating unit" was essentially a box full of solenoids that sat on type of the Linotype's keyboard and pressed the appropriate keys in response to the codes read from the tape, thus creating type for printing in newspapers and magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.smecc.org/teletypes_in_typesetting.htm |title=Teletypes in Typesetting |author=Doug Kerr |publisher=Southwest Museum of Engineering, Communications and Computation | publication-place=Glendale, Arizona, USA |access-date=2017-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years the incoming 6-bit current loop signal carrying the TTS code was connected to a minicomputer or mainframe for storage, editing, and eventual feed to a phototypesetting machine.

==Teleprinters in computing==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Line printer]] --&gt;
Computers used teleprinters for input and output from the early days of computing. [[Punched card]] readers and fast printers replaced teleprinters for most purposes, but teleprinters continued to be used as interactive [[time-sharing]] [[computer terminal|terminals]] until video [[computer display|displays]] became widely available in the late 1970s.

Users typed commands after a [[Command-line interface#Command prompt|prompt]] character was printed. Printing was unidirectional; if the user wanted to delete what had been typed, further characters were printed to indicate that previous text had been cancelled. When video displays first became available the user interface was initially exactly the same as for an electromechanical printer; expensive and scarce video terminals could be used interchangeably with teleprinters. This was the origin of the [[text terminal]] and the [[command-line interface]].

[[File:ASR-33 Teletype terminal IMG 1658.jpg|thumb|A Teletype Model 33 ASR with paper tape reader and punch, as used for [[modem]]-based computing]]
Paper tape was sometimes used to prepare input for the computer session off line and to capture computer output. The popular [[Teletype Model 33]] used 7-bit [[ASCII]] code (with an eighth [[parity bit]]) instead of Baudot. The common [[modem]] communications settings, ''Start/Stop Bits'' and ''Parity,'' stem from the Teletype era.

In early operating systems such as [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital's]] [[RT-11]], serial communication lines were often connected to teleprinters and were given device names starting with &lt;tt&gt;tt&lt;/tt&gt;. This and similar conventions were adopted by many other operating systems. [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s use the [[prefix]] &lt;tt&gt;tty&lt;/tt&gt;, for example &lt;tt&gt;/dev/tty13&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;pty&lt;/tt&gt; (for pseudo-tty), such as &lt;tt&gt;/dev/ptya0&lt;/tt&gt;. In many computing contexts, "TTY" has become the name for any text terminal, such as an external [[system console|console]] device, a user dialing into the system on a [[modem]] on a [[serial port]] device, a printing or graphical [[computer terminal]] on a computer's serial port or the [[RS-232]] port on a [[USB]]-to-RS-232 converter attached to a computer's USB port, or even a [[terminal emulator]] application in the window system using a [[pseudoterminal]] device.

Teleprinters were also used to record fault printout and other information in some [[TXE]] telephone exchanges.

==Obsolescence of teleprinters==

Although printing news, messages, and other text at a distance is still universal, the dedicated teleprinter tied to a pair of leased copper wires was made functionally obsolete by the [[fax]], personal computer, [[inkjet printer]], [[email]], and the Internet.

In the 1980s, [[packet radio]] became the most common form of digital communications used in amateur radio. Soon, advanced multimode electronic interfaces such as the AEA PK-232 were developed, which could send and receive not only packet, but various other modulation types including Baudot. This made it possible for a home or laptop computer to replace teleprinters, saving money, complexity, space and the massive amount of paper which mechanical machines used.

As a result, by the mid-1990s, amateur use of actual Teletype machines had waned, though a core of "purists" still operate on equipment originally manufactured in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.

Despite the obsolescence of teleprinters by the 21st century, its distinctive sound continues to be played in the background of newscasts on the New York City radio station [[WINS (AM)|WINS]], and Philadelphia's [[KYW (AM)|KYW]], a tradition dating back to the mid-1960s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25192">'''Time-Sensitive Networking''' ('''TSN''') is a set of standards under development by the Time-Sensitive Networking task group of the [[IEEE 802.1]] working group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/tsn.html Time - Sensitive networking task Group]&lt;/ref&gt; The TSN task group was formed in November 2012 by renaming the existing [[Audio Video Bridging|Audio Video Bridging Task Group]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/avbridges.html Audio Video Bridging Task Group]&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing its work. The name changed as a result of extension of the working area of the standardization group. The standards define mechanisms for the time-sensitive transmission of data over [[Ethernet]] networks.

The majority of projects define extensions to the IEEE 802.1Q{{snd}} [[Virtual LAN]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1Q.html  Virtual LANs]&lt;/ref&gt; These extensions in particular address the transmission of very low transmission latency and high availability. Possible applications include converged networks with real time Audio/Video Streaming and real-time control streams which are used in automotive or industrial control facilities.

Work is also currently being carried out in [[AVnu Alliance]]{{'}}s specially created Industrial group to define Compliance &amp; Interoperability requirements for TSN networked elements. 
== Key components ==
The different TSN standards documents that are specified by IEEE 802.1 can be grouped into three basic key component categories that are required for a complete real-time communication solution. Each and every standard specification can be used on its own and is mostly self-sufficient. However, only when used together in a concerted way, TSN as a communication system can achieve its full potential. The three basic components are:
# Time synchronization: All devices that are participating in real-time communication need to have a common understanding of time
# Scheduling and traffic shaping: All devices that are participating in real-time communication adhere to the same rules in processing and forwarding communication packets
# Selection of communication paths, path reservations and fault-tolerance: All devices that are participating in real-time communication adhere to the same rules in selecting communication paths and in reserving bandwidth and time slots, possibly utilizing more than one simultaneous path to achieve fault-tolerance

=== Time Synchronization ===
The name "Time-sensitive networking" is already quite descriptive in this regard: In contrast to standard [[Ethernet]] according to [[IEEE 802.3]] and Ethernet bridging according to [http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1Q.html IEEE 802.1Q], time plays an important role in TSN networks. For [[Real-time computing|real-time]] communication with hard, non-negotiable time boundaries for end-to-end transmission latencies, all devices in this network need to have a common time reference and therefore, need to synchronize their clocks among each other. This is not only true for the end devices of a communication stream, such as an industrial controller and a manufacturing robot, but also true for network components, such as [[Ethernet switch]]es. Only through synchronized clocks, it is possible for all network devices to operate in unison and execute the required operation at exactly the required point in time.

Time synchronization in TSN networks can be achieved with different technologies. Theoretically, it is possible to outfit every end device and network switch with a [[GPS clock]]. However, this is costly and there is no guarantee that the Radio or GPS clock has access to the radio or satellite signal at all times - for example if the network is installed in a moving car, on a factory floor or in a tunnel deep beneath the surface of the earth. Due to these constraints, time in TSN networks is usually distributed from one central time source directly through the network itself. In most cases, this is done using the [[Precision Time Protocol|IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol]], which utilizes Ethernet frames to distribute time synchronization information. In addition to the universally applicable IEEE 1588 specification, the Time-Sensitive Task Group of the [[IEEE 802.1]] committee has specified a profile of IEEE 1588, called [[IEEE 802.1AS]]. The idea behind this profile is to narrow the huge list of different IEEE 1588 options down to a manageable few critical options that are applicable to Home networks or networks in automotive car or industrial automation environments.

=== Scheduling and traffic shaping ===
Scheduling and traffic shaping allows for the coexistence of different traffic classes with different priorities on the same network - each with different requirements to available bandwidth and end-to-end latency. Standard bridging according to IEEE 802.1q uses eight distinct priorities with a strict priority scheme. On the protocol level, these priorities are visible in the [[802.1Q VLAN tag]] of a standard [[Ethernet frame]]. These priorities already allow to distinguish between more important and less important network traffic, but even with the highest of the eight priorities, no absolute guarantee for an end-to-end delivery time can be given. The reason for this are buffering effects inside the Ethernet switches. If a switch has started the transmission of an Ethernet frame on one of its ports, even the highest priority frame has to wait inside the switch buffer for this transmission to finish. With standard Ethernet switching, this non-determinism cannot be avoided. This is not an issue in environments where applications do not depend on the timely delivery of single Ethernet frames - such as office IT infrastructures. In these environments, file transfers, emails or other business applications have limited time sensitivity themselves and are usually protected by other mechanisms further up the protocol stack, such as the [[Transmission Control Protocol]]. In industrial automation and automotive car environments, however, where [[Closed-loop control|closed loop control]] or [[Functional safety|safety]] applications are using the Ethernet network, reliable and timely delivery is of utmost importance. For Ethernet to be used here, the strict priority scheduling of IEEE 802.1Q needs to be enhanced.

==== Different time slices for different traffic classes - the IEEE 802.1Qbv time-aware scheduler ====
TSN enhances standard Ethernet communication by adding mechanisms to ensure timely delivery with soft and hard real-time requirements. The mechanism of utilizing the eight distinct VLAN priorities is retained, to ensure complete backwards compatibility to non-TSN Ethernet. This has always been one of the design principles of the IEEE 802 group when developing Ethernet further - maintain backwards compatibility to maintain interoperability with the existing infrastructure and to allow a seamless migration towards new technologies.

With TSN, for each of the eight priorities, a user can select from different mechanisms how Ethernet frames are processed and priorities can be individually assigned to already existing methods (such as the IEEE 802.1Q strict priority scheduler) or new processing methods, such as the TSN IEEE 802.1Qbv time-aware traffic scheduler.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1bv.html IEEE 802.1Qbv]&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical use case for TSN is the communication of a Programmable Logic Controller ([[Programmable logic controller|PLC]]) with an [[industrial robot]] through an Ethernet network. To achieve transmission times with guaranteed end-to-end latency that can support the closed loop control that is operating between the PLC and the robot, one or several of the eight Ethernet priorities can be assigned to the IEEE 802.1Qbv time-aware scheduler. This scheduler is designed to separate the communication on the Ethernet network into fixed length, repeating time cycles. Within these cycles, different time slices can be configured that can be assigned to one or several of the eight Ethernet priorities. By doing this, it is possible to grant exclusive use - for a limited time - to the Ethernet transmission medium for those traffic classes that need transmission guarantees and can't be interrupted. The basic concept is a [[time-division multiple access]] (TDMA) scheme. By establishing virtual communication channels for specific time periods, time-critical communication can be separated from non-critical background traffic. By granting exclusive access to the transmission medium and devices to time-critical traffic classes, the buffering effects in the Ethernet switch transmission buffers can be avoided and time-critical traffic can be transmitted without non-deterministic interruptions. One example for an IEEE 802.1Qbv scheduler configuration is visible in figure 1:
[[File:Figure 1- Example IEEE 802.1Qbv schedule.svg|figure 1: Example IEEE 802.1Qbv schedule|none|thumb|957x957px]]

In this example, each cycle consists of two time slices. Time slice 1 only allows the transmission of traffic tagged with VLAN priority 3, and time slice 2 in each cycle allows for the rest of the priorities to be sent. Since the IEEE 802.1Qbv scheduler requires all clocks on all network devices (Ethernet switches and end devices) to be synchronized and the identical schedule to be configured, all devices understand which priority can be sent to the network at any given point in time. Since time slice 2 has more than one priority assigned to it, within this time slice, the priorities are handled according to standard IEEE 802.1Q strict priority scheduling.

This separation of Ethernet transmissions into cycles and time slices can be enhanced further by the inclusion of other scheduling or traffic shaping algorithms, such as the [[Audio Video Bridging|Audio- and Video Bridging]] traffic shaper IEEE 802.1Qav. IEEE 802.1Qav supports soft real-time.  In this particular example, IEEE 802.1Qav could be assigned to one or two of the priorities that are used in time slice two to distinguish further between audio/video traffic and background file transfers. The [http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/tsn.html IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking Task Group] specifies a number of different schedulers and traffic shapers that can be combined to achieve the nonreactive coexistence of hard real-time, soft real-time and background traffic on the same Ethernet infrastructure.

==== IEEE 802.1Qbv in more detail: Time slices and guard bands ====
When an Ethernet interface has started the transmission of a frame to the transmission medium, this transmission has to be completely finished before another transmission can take place. This includes the transmission of the [[CRC32]] checksum at the end of the frame to ensure a reliable, fault-free transmission. This inherent property of Ethernet networks - again- poses a challenge to the TDMA approach of the IEEE 802.1Qbv scheduler. This is visible in figure 2:
[[File:IEEE 802.1Qbv - time slice infringement.svg|figure 2: Frame that is sent too late in the best effort time slice infringes the high-priority time slice|none|thumb|957x957px]]

Just before the end of time slice 2 in cycle n, a new frame transmission is started. Unfortunately, this frame is too large to fit into its time slice. Since the transmission of this frame cannot be interrupted, the frame infringes the following time slice 1 of the next cycle n+1. By partially or completely blocking a time-critical time slice, real-time frames can be delayed up to the point where they cannot meet the application requirements any longer. This is very similar to the actual buffering effects that happen in non-TSN Ethernet switches, so TSN has to specify a mechanism to prevent this from happening.

The IEEE 802.1Qbv time-aware scheduler has to ensure that the Ethernet interface is not busy with the transmission of a frame when the scheduler changes from one time slice into the next. The time-aware scheduler achieves this by putting a guard band in front of every time slice that carries time-critical traffic. During this guard band time, no new Ethernet frame transmission may be started, only already ongoing transmissions may be finished. The duration of this guard band has to be as long as it takes the maximum frame size to be safely transmitted. For an Ethernet frame according to IEEE 802.3 with a single IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tag and including [[Interpacket gap|interframe spacing]], the total length is: 1500 byte (frame payload) + 18 byte (ethernet addresses, ethertype and CRC) + 4 byte (VLAN Tag) + 12 byte (Interframe spacing) + 8 byte (preamble and SFD) = 1542 byte.

The total time needed for sending this frame is dependant on the link speed of the Ethernet network. With Fast Ethernet and 100 Mbit/s transmission rate, the transmission duration is as follows:

&lt;math&gt;t_{maxframe} = \frac{1542\ byte}{12.5 \cdot 10^6\ byte \cdot \frac{1}{s}} = 123.36 \cdot 10^{-6} s&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the guard band has to be at least 123.36&amp;nbsp;µs long. With the guard band, the total bandwidth / time that is usable within a time slice is reduced by the length of the guard band. This is visible in figure 3:
[[File:TSN IEEE 802.1Qbv Example with guard band.svg|figure 3: Guard bands prevent the infringement of time slices with critical traffic|none|thumb|957x957px]]

Note: to facilitate the presentation of the topic, the actual size of the guard band in figure 3 is not to scale, but is significantly smaller than indicated by the frame in figure 2.

In this example, the time slice 1 always contains high priority data (e.g. for motion control), while time slice 2 always contains best effort data.Therefore, a guard band needs to be placed at every transition point into time slice 1 to protect the time slice of the critical data stream(s).

While the guard bands manage to protect the time slices with high priority, critical traffic, they also have some significant drawbacks:
* The time that is consumed by a guard band is lost - it cannot be used to transmit any data, as the Ethernet port needs to be silent. Therefore, the lost time directly translates in lost bandwidth for background traffic on that particular Ethernet link.
* A single time slice can never be configured smaller than the size of the guard band. Especially with lower speed Ethernet connections and growing guard band size, this has a negative impact on the lowest achievable time slice length and cycle time.
To partially mitigate the loss of bandwidth through the guard band, the standard IEEE 802.1Qbv includes a length-aware scheduling mechanism. This mechanism is used when [[Network switch|store-and-forward switching]] is utilized: after the full reception of an Ethernet frame that needs to be transmitted on a port where the guard band is in effect, the scheduler checks the overall length of the frame. If the frame can fit completely inside the guard band, without any infringement of the following high priority slice, the scheduler can send this frame, despite an active guard band, and reduce the waste of bandwidth. This mechanism, however, cannot be used when [[cut-through switching]] is enabled, since the total length of the Ethernet frame needs to be known a priori. Therefore, when cut-through switching is used to minimize end-to-end latency, the waste of bandwidth will still occur. Also, this does not help with the minimum achievable cycle time. Therefore, length-aware scheduling is an improvement, but cannot mitigate all drawbacks that are introduced by the guard band.

==== Frame pre-emption and minimizing the guard band ====
To further mitigate the negative effects from the guard bands, the IEEE working groups 802.1 and [http://www.ieee802.org/3/ 802.3] have specified the frame pre-emption technology. The two working groups collaborated in this endeavour, since the technology required both changes in the Ethernet [[Media access control|Media Access Control (MAC)]] scheme that is under the control of IEEE 802.3, as well as changes in the management mechanisms that are under the control of IEEE 802.1. Due to this fact, frame pre-emption is described in two different standards documents: IEEE 802.1Qbu&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1bu.html IEEE 802.1Qbu]&lt;/ref&gt; for the bridge management component and IEEE 802.3br&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee802.org/3/br/index.html IEEE 802.3br]&lt;/ref&gt; for the Ethernet MAC component.
[[File:TSN frame pre-emption.svg|Figure 4: Example of frame pre-emption|none|thumb|957x957px]]

Figure 4 gives a basic example how frame pre-emption works. During the process of sending a best effort Ethernet frame, the MAC interrupts the frame transmission just before the start of the guard band. The partial frame is completed with a CRC and will be stored in the next switch to wait for the second part of the frame to arrive. After the high priority traffic in time slice 1 has passed and the cycle switches back to time slice 2, the interrupted frame transmission is resumed. Frame pre-emption always operates on a pure link-by-link basis and only fragments from one Ethernet switch to the next Ethernet switch, where the frame is reassembled. In contrast to [[Internet Protocol|fragmentation with the Internet Protocol (IP)]], no end-to-end fragmentation is supported.

Each partial frame is completed by a CRC32 for error detection. In contrast to the regular Ethernet CRC32, the last 16 bit are inverted to make a partial frame distinguishable from a regular Ethernet frame. In addition, also the [[start of frame delimiter]] (SFD) is changed.

The support for frame pre-emption has to be activated on each link between devices individually. To signal the capability for frame pre-emption on a link, an Ethernet switch announces this capability through the [[Link Layer Discovery Protocol|LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol)]]. When a device receives such an LLDP announcement on a network port and supports frame pre-emption itself, it may activate the capability. There is no direct negotiation and activation of the capability on adjacent devices. Any device that receives the LLDP pre-emption announcement assumes that on the other end of the link, a device is present that can understand the changes in the frame format (changed CRC32 and SFD).

Frame pre-emption allows for a significant reduction of the guard band. The length of the guard band is now dependant on the precision of the frame pre-emption mechanism: how small is the minimum size of the frame that the mechanism can still pre-empt. IEEE 802.3br specifies the best accuracy for this mechanism at 64 byte - due to the fact that this is the minimum size of a still valid Ethernet frame. In this case, the guard band can be reduced to a total of 127 byte: 64 byte (minimum frame) + 63 byte (remaining length that cannot be pre-empted). All larger frames can be pre-empted again and therefore, there is no need to protect against this size with a guard band.

This minimizes the best effort bandwidth that is lost and also allows for much shorter cycle times at slower Ethernet speeds, such as 100 Mbit/s and below. Since the pre-emption takes place in hardware in the MAC, as the frame passes through, cut-through switching can be supported as well, since the overall frame size is not needed a priori. The MAC interface just checks in regular 64 byte intervals whether the frame needs to be pre-empted or not.

The combination of time synchronization, the IEEE 802.1Qbv scheduler and frame pre-emption already constitutes an effective set of standards that can be utilized to guarantee the coexistence of different traffic categories on a network while also providing end-to-end latency guarantees. This will be enhanced further as new IEEE 802.1 specifications, such as 802.1Qch are finalized.

=== Selection of communication paths, reservation and fault-tolerance ===
The TSN technology, especially the time-aware scheduler according to IEEE 802.1Qbv, have been developed for use in mission-critical network environments. In these networks, not only are timing guarantees relevant, but fault-tolerance is as well. Networks that support applications such as safety-relevant control loops or autonomous driving in vehicles have to be protected against faults in hardware or network media. The TSN task group is currently specifying the fault-tolerance protocol IEEE 802.1CB&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1cb.html IEEE 802.1CB]&lt;/ref&gt; for this purpose. In addition to this protocol, existing high-availability protocols such as [[High-availability Seamless Redundancy|HSR]] or [[Parallel Redundancy Protocol|PRP]] that are specified in IEC 62439-3, can be utilized.

To register fault-tolerant communication streams across a network, Path control and reservation as specified in IEEE 802.1Qca,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1ca.html IEEE 802.1Qca]&lt;/ref&gt; manual configuration or vendor-specific solutions can be used.

In the currently ongoing project IEEE 802.1Qcc, the TSN task group focuses on the definition of management interfaces and protocols to enable TSN network administration on large scale networks. Three different aspects are discussed here, both with a de-centralized approach as well as a fully centralized approach that re-uses configuration concepts from [[Software-defined networking|software-defined networking (SDN)]]. The current discussion can be followed through the public document archive of IEEE 802.1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee802.org/1/files/public/ public document archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''topological quantum computer''' is a theoretical [[quantum computer]] that employs two-dimensional [[quasiparticle]]s called [[anyon]]s, whose [[world line]]s pass around one another to form [[braid theory|braids]] in a three-dimensional [[spacetime]] (i.e., one temporal plus two spatial dimensions). These braids form the [[logic gate]]s that make up the computer. The advantage of a quantum computer based on quantum braids over using trapped quantum particles is that the former is much more stable. Small, cumulative perturbations can cause quantum states to [[quantum decoherence|decohere]] and introduce errors in the computation, but such small perturbations do not change the braids' [[braid theory|topological properties]]. This is like the effort required to cut a string and reattach the ends to form a different braid, as opposed to a ball (representing an ordinary quantum particle in four-dimensional spacetime) bumping into a wall. [[Alexei Kitaev]] proposed topological quantum computation in 1997. While the elements of a topological quantum computer originate in a purely mathematical realm, experiments in [[Fractional quantum Hall effect|fractional quantum Hall systems]] indicate these elements may be created in the real world using [[semiconductor]]s made of [[gallium arsenide]] at a temperature of near [[absolute zero]] and subjected to strong [[magnetic fields]].

==Introduction==
[[Anyon]]s are quasiparticles in a two-dimensional space. Anyons are neither [[fermion]]s nor [[boson]]s, but like fermions, they cannot occupy the same state. Thus, the [[world lines]] of two anyons cannot intersect or merge, which allows their paths to form stable braids in space-time. Anyons can form from excitations in a cold, two-dimensional electron gas in a very strong magnetic field, and carry fractional units of magnetic flux. This phenomenon is called the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]]. In typical laboratory systems, the electron gas occupies a thin semiconducting layer sandwiched between layers of aluminium gallium arsenide.

When anyons are braided, the transformation of the quantum state of the system
depends only on the topological class of the anyons' trajectories (which are classified
according to the [[braid group]]). Therefore, the quantum information which is stored in the state of the system is impervious to small errors in the trajectories.
In 2005, [[Sankar Das Sarma]], [[Michael Freedman]], and [[Chetan Nayak]] proposed a quantum Hall device which would realize a topological qubit.
In a key development for topological quantum computers, in 2005 Vladimir J. Goldman, Fernando E. Camino, and Wei Zhou were said to have created the first experimental evidence for using fractional quantum Hall effect to create actual anyons, although others have suggested their results could be the product of phenomena not involving anyons. It should also be noted that [[non-abelian group|non-abelian]] anyons, a species required for topological quantum computers, have yet to be experimentally confirmed. Possible experimental evidence has been found,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Willet|first=R.L.|date=January 15, 2013|title=Magnetic field-tuned Aharonov–Bohm oscillations and evidence for non-Abelian anyons at ν = 5/2|arxiv=1301.2639|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.186401|pmid=|access-date=|bibcode=2013PhRvL.111r6401W}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the conclusions remain contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.126807| title=Enhanced Bulk-Edge Coulomb Coupling in Fractional Fabry-Perot Interferometers|first1=Curt | last1=von Keyserling | first2=S.

==Topological vs. standard quantum computer==

Topological quantum computers are equivalent in computational power to other standard models of quantum computation, in particular to the [[quantum circuit]] model and to the [[quantum Turing machine]] model.  That is, any of these models can efficiently simulate any of the others.  Nonetheless, certain algorithms may be a more natural fit to the topological quantum computer model.  For example, algorithms for evaluating the [[Jones polynomial]] were first developed in the topological model, and only later converted and extended in the standard quantum circuit model.

===Computations===
To live up to its name, a topological quantum computer must provide the unique computation properties promised by a conventional quantum computer design, which uses trapped quantum particles. Fortunately in 2002, [[Michael H. Freedman]], [[Alexei Kitaev]], [[Michael J. Larsen]], and Zhenghan Wang proved that a topological quantum computer can, in principle, perform any computation that a conventional quantum computer can do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freedman|first=Michael|last2=Kitaev|first2=Alexei|last3=Larsen|first3=Michael|last4=Wang|first4=Zhenghan|date=2003-01-01|title=Topological quantum computation|url=http://www.ams.org/bull/2003-40-01/S0273-0979-02-00964-3/|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume=40|issue=1|pages=31–38|doi=10.1090/S0273-0979-02-00964-3|issn=0273-0979|arxiv=quant-ph/0101025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They found that a conventional quantum computer device, given an error-free operation of its logic circuits, will give a solution with an absolute level of accuracy, whereas a topological quantum computing device with flawless operation will give the solution with only a finite level of accuracy. However, any level of precision for the answer can be obtained by adding more braid twists (logic circuits) to the topological quantum computer, in a simple linear relationship. In other words, a reasonable increase in elements (braid twists) can achieve a high degree of accuracy in the answer. Actual computation [gates] are done by the edge states of a fractional quantum  Hall effect. This makes models of one-dimensional anyons important. In one space dimension, anyons are defined algebraically.

=== Error correction and control ===

Even though quantum braids are inherently more stable than trapped quantum particles, there is still a need to control for error inducing thermal fluctuations, which produce random stray pairs of anyons which interfere with adjoining braids. Controlling these errors is simply a matter of separating the anyons to a distance where the rate of interfering strays drops to near zero.  Simulating the dynamics of a topological quantum computer may be a promising method of implementing fault-tolerant quantum computation even with a standard quantum information processing scheme. Raussendorf, Harrington, and Goyal have studied one model, with promising simulation results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raussendorf|first=R.|last2=Harrington|first2=J.|last3=Goyal|first3=K.|date=2007-01-01|title=Topological fault-tolerance in cluster state quantum computation|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1367-2630/9/i=6/a=199|journal=New Journal of Physics|language=en|volume=9|issue=6|pages=199|doi=10.1088/1367-2630/9/6/199|issn=1367-2630|arxiv=quant-ph/0703143|bibcode=2007NJPh....9..199R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example: Computing with Fibonacci Anyons ==
One of the prominent examples in topological quantum computing is with a system of [[fibonacci anyons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trebst|first=Simon|date=2008|title=A Short Introduction to Fibonacci Anyon Models|url=http://stationq.cnsi.ucsb.edu/~wang/Publications/34.pdf|journal=Progress of Theoretical Physics Supplement No. 176|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These anyons can be used to create generic gates for topological quantum computing. There are three main steps for creating a model:
* Choose our basis and restrict our [[Hilbert space]]
* Braid the anyons together
* Fuse the anyons at the end, and detect how they fuse in order to read the output of the system.

=== State Preparation ===

Fibonacci Anyons are defined by three qualities:
# They have a topological charge of &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. In this discussion, we consider another charge — &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; — which is the ‘vacuum’ charge if anyons are annihilated with each-other.
# Each of these anyons are their own antiparticle. &lt;math&gt;\tau = \tau^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1 = 1^*&lt;/math&gt;.
# If brought close to each-other, they will ‘fuse’ together in a nontrivial fashion. Specifically, the ‘fusion’ rules are:
## &lt;math&gt;1 \otimes 1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
## &lt;math&gt;1 \otimes \tau = \tau \otimes 1 = \tau&lt;/math&gt;
## &lt;math&gt;\tau \otimes \tau = 1 \oplus \tau&lt;/math&gt;
# Many of the properties of this system can be explained similarly to that of two spin 1/2 particles. Particularly, we use the same [[tensor product]] &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; and [[direct sum]] &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; operators.
The last ‘fusion’ rule can be extended this to a system of three anyons:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau \otimes \tau \otimes \tau = \tau \otimes (1 \oplus \tau) = \tau \otimes 1 \oplus \tau \otimes \tau = \tau \oplus 1 \oplus \tau = 1 \oplus 2 \cdot \tau&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, fusing three anyons will yield a final state of total charge &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; in 2 ways, or a charge of &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; in exactly one way. We use three states to define our basis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nayak|first=Chetan|date=2008|title=Non-Abelian Anyons and Topological Quantum Computation|arxiv=0707.1889|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.80.1083|pmid=|access-date=|bibcode=2008RvMP...80.1083N}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because we wish to encode these three anyon states as superpositions of 0 and 1, we need to limit the basis to a two-dimensional Hilbert Space. Thus, we consider only two states with a total charge of &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. This choice is purely phenomenological. In these states, we group the two leftmost anyons into a 'control group', and leave the rightmost as a 'non-computational anyon'. We classify a &lt;math&gt;|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; state as one where the control group has total 'fused' charge of &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, and a state of &lt;math&gt;|1 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; has a control group with a total 'fused' charge of &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. For a more complete description, see Nayak.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Gates ===

Following the ideas above, [[Adiabatic theorem|adiabatically]] braiding these anyons around each-other with result in a unitary transformation. These braid operators are a result of two subclasses of operators:
* The F matrix
* The R matrix
The R matrix can be conceptually thought of as the topological phase that is imparted onto the anyons during the braid. As the anyons wind around each-other, they pick up some phase due to the [[Aharonov–Bohm effect|Aharonov-Bohm]] effect.

The F matrix is a result of the physical rotations of the anyons. As they braid between each-other, it is important to realize that the bottom two anyons—the control group—will still distinguish the state of the qubit. Thus, braiding the anyons will change which anyons are in the control group, and therefore change the basis. We evaluate the anyons by always fusing the control group (the bottom anyons) together first, so exchanging which anyons these are will rotate the system. Because these anyons are [[non-abelian group|non-abelian]], the order of the anyons (which ones are within the control group) will matter, and as such they will transform the system.

The complete braid operator can be derived as:

&lt;math&gt;B=F^{-1} R F&lt;/math&gt;

In order to mathematically construct the F and R operators, we can consider permutations of these F and R operators. We know that if we sequentially change the basis that we are operating on, this will eventually lead us back to the same basis. Similarly, we know that if we braid anyons around each-other a certain number of times, this will lead back to the same state. These axioms are called the [[pentagon]]al and [[hexagonal axiom]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s respectively as performing the operation can be visualized with a pentagon/hexagon of state transformations. Although mathematically difficult,&lt;ref&gt;Eric Paquette. Topological quantum computing with anyons, 1 2009. Categories, Logic and Foundations of Physics IV.&lt;/ref&gt; these can be approached much more successfully visually.

With these braid operators, we can finally formalize the notion of braids in terms of how they act on our Hilbert space and construct arbitrary universal quantum gates.

Explicit braids that perform particular quantum computations with Fibonacci anyons have been given by &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.140503|title=Braid Topologies for Quantum Computation | bibcode=2005PhRvL..95n0503B | volume=95|journal=Physical Review Letters|arxiv=quant-ph/0505065}}&lt;/ref&gt;
