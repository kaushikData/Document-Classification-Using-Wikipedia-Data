[[File:Annie Bindon Carter.jpg|thumb|Mrs Annie Bindon Carter MBE (1883-1969), co-founder of Painted Fabrics, Sheffield]]

== Early life ==

Annie Bindon Carter was born in Nottingham, England in 1883 and educated at Ladies’ Moravian School in Oakbrook, Derby. She excelled at art and design and won a scholarship to study at Sheffield Technical School of Art.&lt;ref&gt;City of Sheffield Education Committee Annual Prize Giving Ceremony, Mappin Art Gallery 1906 (brochure) p.2 &amp; p.6 and City of Sheffield Education Committee Annual Prize Giving Ceremony, Mappin Art Gallery, Sheffield, 1908 (brochure) p.7 &amp; p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

Annie, together with three other ex-art school students, her sister Dorothy Bindon Carter, Phyllis Lawton and [[Edith Jagger]], all volunteered at [[Middlewood Hospital|Wharncliffe War Hospital]], Sheffield during 1915/16. They assisted in the rehabilitation of servicemen returning injured from the Great War through informal art classes. The four women went on to found Painted Fabrics in 1917, with the aim of 'establishing a charitable organisation which would actively rehabilitate severely injured ex-servicemen through occupational therapy'.&lt;ref&gt;Nutt, Elizabeth Strying. ‘Sheffield Technical School of Art Student Magazine’ (Winter 1918) Volume 1, Number 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Painted Fabrics ==

The result was Painted Fabrics, a ground breaking charitable organisation designed to enable severely disabled soldiers and sailors, which included double amputees and those suffering from shell shock to work and to have a roof over their and their families' heads. A policy which adhered to the company's motto 'Work not Charity'.

Annie, was the wife of the successful Sheffield industrialist, Geoffrey Carter, who was himself, a serving officer abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Nutt, Elizabeth Strying. ‘Sheffield Technical School of Art Student Magazine’ (Winter 1918) Volume 1, Number 2&lt;/ref&gt; From the outset, Annie, being the dominant personality of the group was instrumental in making sure Painted Fabrics became a limited company in 1923. The company then acquired the lease to a former army camp at Norton, on the south-west edge of Sheffield. The wooden huts became print and design workshops and accommodation was supplied to the men and their families.&lt;ref&gt;Wills, Hilary. ‘Sheffield Artists 1840-1940’. Published by The Basement Gallery, Sheffield. 1996 p.11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The ex-servicemen hand-printed designs onto various fabrics, using a wide variety of printing techniques. These fabrics were then made up into a myriad of ‘Painted Fabrics products’, which included dresses, table cloths and curtains.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Annie Bindon Carter.jpg|thumbnail]] --&gt;
Annie, affectionately known as ''ABC'' by the employees of Painted Fabrics, dealt with the day-to-day running of the company. She acted as the conduit between the men, the press and the companies illustrious board. As one of the company's five directors and Honorary Secretary, Annie used her administrative skills perfectly, through her, the company were conferred with several [[Royal warrant of appointment|Royal Warrants]]. She was awarded an [[MBE]] in 1926, in recognition of her work ‘for disabled soldiers and sailors’.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, Malcolm Leary. ‘Painted With Pride’. Published by RMC Books, Sheffield. 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sheffield Telegraph|Sheffield Daily Telegraph]], in August 1930, wrote about Annie in the ‘Who’s Who in Sheffield’ ; ''It is difficult to write of Mrs. Carter without giving the history of Painted Fabrics, as she has been so closely associated with it. The greatness of the work has often over-shadowed the personality of its originator, who is one of the simplest and happiest of people. An instance of the fine effect that living for others has upon one’s own outlook.''&lt;ref&gt;The Sheffield Daily Telegraph, 16 August 1930&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1930’s, Painted Fabrics Limited employed 36 ex-servicemen and also supported their immediate families. The administration of Painted Fabrics took up most of her time. Despite national press coverage, exhibitions and displays across the country, sales fluctuated and the company faced continual financial hardship. The company effectively ceased in 1939, when the companies site at Norton was requisitioned by the War Office. Painted Fabrics was re-established after World War Two finished, though not to the same extent as its earlier incarnation. Driven by Annie’s self-belief it continued through until it was officially closed in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/exhibition/anniebindoncarter&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later years ==

She was awarded an honorary M.A. by the University of Sheffield in 1959. After a visit to the newly built main university library in 1961 (renamed Western Bank Library), she presented the librarian with a cheque for £1,000. These funds were used to purchase ‘outstanding examples of modern book production by private presses’.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/exhibition/anniebindoncarter&lt;/ref&gt;

Annie died in 1969. A blue plaque was unveiled in 2000, at the former site of Painted Fabrics, the plaque described Annie Bindon Carter as a ‘humanitarian’. An exhibition featuring work produced by Painted Fabrics entitled ‘Business and Benefaction: the colourful life of Sheffield artist Annie Bindon Carter’, was held at Weston Bank Library, The University of Sheffield in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/exhibition/anniebindoncarter&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}
An '''arbitration clause''' is a clause in a contract that requires the parties to resolve their disputes through an [[arbitration]] process. Although such a clause may or may not specify that arbitration occur within a specific [[jurisdiction]], it always binds the parties to a type of resolution outside the courts, and is therefore considered a kind of [[forum selection clause]].

==Enforceability==

In the United States, the federal government has expressed a policy of support of arbitration clauses, because they reduce the burden on court systems to resolve disputes. This support is found in the [[Federal Arbitration Act]], which permits compulsory and binding arbitration, under which parties give up the right to appeal an arbitrator's decision to a court. In ''[[Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co.]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court established the "separability principle", under which enforceability of a contract must be challenged in arbitration before any court action, unless the arbitration clause itself has been challenged.

Some jurisdictions exclude or restrict the possibility of arbitration for reasons of the protection of weaker members of the public, e.g. consumers. For example, German law excludes disputes over the rental of living space from any form of arbitration,&lt;ref&gt;Section 1030 subsection 2 ''Zivilprozessordnung''&lt;/ref&gt; while arbitration agreements with consumers are only considered valid if they are signed,&lt;ref&gt;To be correct: A certain form, as defined by statute, of an electronic signature using a chip card and a PIN code is also sufficient&lt;/ref&gt; and if the signed document does not bear any other content than the arbitration agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Section 1031 subesction 5 of the ''Zivilprozessordnung''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==

Mandatory arbitration clauses are widespread but not universal in the United States.  For example, they are used by [[Amazon.com]], 15 of the largest 20 U.S. credit card issuers, and 7 of the 8 largest cell phone companies, and 2 out of 3 major [[bike sharing]] companies in Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/bike-share-user-agreements-the-rights-you-give-up-by-renting-a-limebike-or-ofo/ Did you read the fine print? We did. These are the rights you give up by renting a LimeBike or ofo]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contractual language==

The [[American Arbitration Association]] provides the following template for an arbitration clause:&lt;ref name="aaa-drafting"&gt;{{cite web|author1=American Arbitration Association|authorlink1=American Arbitration Association|title=Drafting Dispute Resolution Clauses: A Practical Guide|url=https://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_002540|accessdate=July 31, 2016|page=10|format=PDF|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial [or other] Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In keeping with the informality of the arbitration process, the law in England and Wales is generally keen to uphold the validity of arbitration clauses even when they lack the normal formal language associated with legal contracts.  Clauses which have been upheld include:
* "arbitration in London – English law to apply"&lt;ref&gt;''Swiss Bank Corporation v Novrissiysk Shipping'' [1995] 1 Lloyd's Rep 202&lt;/ref&gt;
* "suitable arbitration clause"&lt;ref&gt;''Hobbs Padgett &amp; Co v J C Kirkland'' (1969) 113 SJ 832&lt;/ref&gt;
* "arbitration, if any, by ICC Rules in London"&lt;ref&gt;''Mangistaumunaigaz Oil Production v United Kingdom World Trade'' [1995] 1 Lloyd's Rep 617&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts{{where|date=August 2018}} have also upheld clauses which specify resolution of disputes other than in accordance with a specific legal system.  These include provision indicating:
* that the arbitrators "must not necessarily judge according to the strict law but as a general rule ought chiefly to consider the principles of practical business"&lt;ref&gt;''Norske Atlas Insurance Co v London General Insurance Co'' (1927) 28 Lloyds List Rep 104&lt;/ref&gt;
* "internationally accepted principles of law governing contractual relations"&lt;ref&gt;''Deutsche Schachtbau v R'As al-Khaimah National Oil Co'' [1990] 1 AC 295&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sample clauses==
A number of [[international arbitration]] bodies provide sample arbitration clauses for parties to use. Examples of these are:

'''Carlos Alberto Bulgheroni''' (March 9, 1945 – September 3, 2016) was an Argentine businessman prominent in the nation's [[Energy in Argentina|energy sector]], and the country's richest man at the time of his death.

==Early life==
Carlos Bulgheroni was born in [[Rufino, Santa Fe|Rufino]], [[Santa Fe Province]], to a [[Spanish Argentine|Spanish]] mother and an [[Italian Argentine|Italian]] father.&lt;ref name=blue&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bluechipmag.com/bc/content_detail.php?content=64 |title=Carlos Bulgheroni - the intrepid entrepreneur |work=Blue Chip |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110033932/http://www.bluechipmag.com/bc/content_detail.php?content=64 |archivedate=2010-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He enrolled at the [[University of Buenos Aires]], and earned a ''[[juris doctor]]'' in 1970. Bulgheroni developed [[lymphoma]] at age 24, but recovered.&lt;ref name=perfil&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2010/03/15/noticia_0018.html|title=Petróleo y millones: la historia de los Bulgheroni|work=Perfil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He joined his father Alejandro in [[Bridas Corporation]], founded by the Bulgheroni family in 1948 and by the 1970s one of the largest private firms in the Argentine energy sector. The senior Bulgheroni died in 1985 and left a controlling stake in the firm to Carlos and his elder brother, Alejandro. Carlos Bulgheroni became the firm's chief political point man, establishing good working relationships with the various administrations in power since 1983.&lt;ref name=perfil/&gt; He was named president and chairman in 1993; president of the [[British Petroleum|BP]]-controlled PanAmerican Energy in 1997; of [[Allis-Chalmers]]'s energy unit in 2006; and of EDIC, a company specializing in the exploration and production of [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] in the [[North Africa]]n, [[Russia]]n, [[Central Asia]]n, and [[Middle East|Middle]] and [[Far East]]ern markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=28799704&amp;ric=ALY&amp;previousCapId=1066957&amp;previousTitle=Allis-Chalmers%20Energy%2C%20Inc. ''BusinessWeek'': Carlos Alberto Bulgheroni]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulgheroni obtained, in 1992, some of the first gas exploration concessions granted in [[Turkmenistan]] to a foreign energy company.&lt;ref name=blue/&gt; He was further involved during 1997 in negotiations between Bridas and the ruling [[Taliban]] faction in [[Afghanistan]] to build the [[Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline|Trans-Afghanistan Gas Pipeline]] from Turkmenistan to [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2005/11/08/elpais/p-02003.htm ''Clarín'' (11/8/2005) {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; These negotiations were in competition with those undertaken by [[Unocal]],&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/west_asia/37021.stm Taleban in Texas for talks on gas pipeline (12/4/1997)]&lt;/ref&gt; and although an agreement with Unocal-led corporation [[CentGas]] was reached, the deal was forfeited in January 1998 in favor of one with Bridas.&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/s/w_asia/44521.stm BBC: Taleban says it's ready to sign Turkmen pipeline deal (1/4/1998)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Instability in Afghanistan delayed construction of the pipeline, however, and following the [[Operation Enduring Freedom|United States Invasion of Afghanistan]] in October 2001, the Bridas contract was rescinded in favor of the former one with Unocal. In 2006, Bulgheroni indicated interest in Bridas' involvement with the Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline project, which continued to be hampered by the [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|ongoing chaos]] in the Central Asian nation.&lt;ref name=envir&gt;[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/apr2006/2006-04-17-05.asp ''Environment News Service'': Afghanistan's New Pipeline Deal May Be Just Another Pipe Dream (4/17/2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulgheroni is a co-founder of the [[Teatro Colón|Colón Theatre]] Foundation (1978) and of the [[Policia Federal Argentina|Federal District Police]] Foundation (1989); the latter helps maintain the Churruca Police Officers Hospital, in [[Buenos Aires]]. He is also a member of the [[Buenos Aires Stock Exchange]], the Foundation for Latin American Economic Research (FIEL), the [[Peres Center for Peace]], the Argentine Russian Business Council, and the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] (CSIS). At CSIS, in addition to acting as a trustee, he also serves as an international councillor and a senior adviser to the [[Space Exploration Initiative]].&lt;ref name=csis&gt;[http://csis.org/expert/carlos-bulgheroni CSIS:Carlos Bulgheroni] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225062528/http://csis.org/expert/carlos-bulgheroni |date=2009-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He previously served as co-chairman of the International Committee at the [[Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] and currently serves as a member there. He is the founder and current partner of the U.S. &amp; Argentine Caucus. He was named Grand Officer of the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]]. Previously, Bulgheroni served as president of the Argentine Business Council, as a member of the Business Advisory Board of the [[World Trade Organization]] in [[Geneva]], as president and representative for [[Mercosur]] from 1990 to 2002 for the Mercosur European Business Forum, and as a member of the Executive Board of the [[International Chamber of Commerce|ICC]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=csis/&gt; The Bulgheroni brothers sold a 50% stake in Bridas to Chinese oil giant [[CNOOC]] in 2010 for US$3.1 billion.&lt;ref name=perfil/&gt; They retained a 20% stake in PanAmerican Energy (whose operations in Argentina had grown to become the nation's second-largest) through Bridas.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

==Death==
Bulgheroni died in Washington DC, on 3 September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infobae.com/sociedad/2016/09/03/murio-el-empresario-carlos-bulgheroni/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2108">A '''channel partner''' is a company that partners with a manufacturer or producer to market and sell the manufacturer's products, services, or technologies. This is usually done through a [[co-branding]] relationship. Channel partners may be distributors, vendors, retailers, consultants, systems integrators (SI), technology deployment consultancies, and [[value-added reseller]]s (VARs) and other such organizations.

== Managed services channel partner ==
The [[Managed services|Managed Services]] Channel Program (MSCP) defines managed services based on market and industry [[best practice]]s, validates a provider’s managed service against those standards, and offers escalating rewards tied to the value delivered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Channel partner programs|url=https://www.channelinstitute.com/successful-channel-partner-programs |accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outsourcing channel partner ==
The Outsourcing Channel Program is designed for partners who are taking over management of customer assets for multiple years across multiple technologies, either at the customer site or at another location like a remote [[data center]].

== Referral partner ==
The referral partner is any individual, usually a professional consultant, existing customer, or sales professional, who can refer new customers to the manufacturer in any number of ways.  Increasingly, companies are taking advantage of this type of partner as more and more individuals find work independently consulting and referring manufacturer solutions to their clients—which in essence provides a low cost way for manufacturers to manage their sales efforts.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== Partner relationship management (PRM) software ==
With the increased reliance on the channel to drive sales efforts, technology has emerged to help support these efforts. [[Partner relationship management]] (PRM) is the term most widely used to refer to this type of technology.

'''David R. Altman''' (1915-August 30, 2000) was an American advertising executive who co-founded the ''Altman, Stoller, Weiss'' advertising agency.&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/08/business/david-r-altman-85-is-dead-his-ads-built-several-brands.html New York Times: "David R. Altman, 85, Is Dead; His Ads Built Several Brands" by Mary Williams Walsh] September 8, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BalSunObit&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-09-12/news/0009120286_1_altman-household-names-north-alabama Baltimore Sun: "David R. Altman, 85, a fashion advertising executive who built several obscure clothing lines into household names, died Aug. 30 in New York"] September 12, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family,&lt;ref name=JVL&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/advertising Jewish Virtual Library: "Modern Jewish History: Advertising"] retrieved May 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Altman served as an Army weapons instructor during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt; After the war, he attended [[New York University School of Law]] at night on the [[G.I. Bill]].&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt; While in school, he worked during the day as the advertising director for the trade magazine, ''The Women's Reporter.''&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt; Although he earned a law degree, he instead accepted a job as an account executive with the fashion house, Irving Serwer Advertising.&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt; In 1950, he founded Altman &amp; Stoller with fellow Irving Serwer alumni [[Max Stoller]] where he served as chairman.&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/10/obituaries/max-stoller.html New York Times: "Obituary: Max Stoller"] May 10, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

Altman focused on the fashion industry which was ripe for development as most clothing manufacturers typically pitched their concepts direct to the stores rather than develop the brand with the general public.&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt; Through his ad campaigns, Altman was credited with transforming then unknown fashion brands into household names.&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt; He developed the [[Wrangler (jeans)|Wrangler jeans]] brand with ads that promised that the jeans would fade exactly how teenagers wanted them.&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt;  He transitioned Monet jewelry from being perceived as low-cost to a premier brand by photographing inexpensive pieces on supermodels.&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt; He promoted the [[Russ Togs]] brand with a red neon sign the read ''RRRRRRRRRuss Toggs'' at the entrance to the [[Queens–Midtown Tunnel|Midtown Tunnel]] in [[Manhattan]], elongating the name into a sexy purr.&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt; His creed was "Find your character; create your character; concentrate on your character."&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt;

In 1955, the firm became ''Altman, Stoller, and Chalk'' with the addition of [[Howard W. Chalk]] as a partner; Chalk left the company to start ''Chalk, Nissen, Hanft''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/19/business/howard-w-chalk-76-former-ad-executive.html New York Times: "Howard W. Chalk, 76, Former Ad Executive"] December 19, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  The firm became ''Altman, Stoller, Weiss'' in the mid 1970s after Melvin D. Weiss joined the firm.&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt; The firm then diversified out of fashion advertising winning accounts with the Spanish tourist board, Ezo denture adhesive, and Lanson champagne, and handled the introduction of [[Newsweek]]'s [[Inside Sports]] magazine.&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt; In 1978, he published an editorial in the New York Times that he was sickened by what television advertising had done to election campaigns which often promoted mediocre candidates stating "'A candidate is not a can of soup."

Altman, Stoller, Weiss was later purchased by Nadler &amp; Larimer Advertising where it was maintained as a subsidiary before being fully absorbed and the name retired in 1983.&lt;ref name=NYTNadler&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/04/business/advertising-nadler-larimer-absorbing-subsidiaries.html New York Times: "ADVERTISING; Nadler &amp; Larimer Absorbing Subsidiaries" By Philip H. Dougherty] August 4, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Altman became an executive vice president at Nadler &amp; Larimer.&lt;ref name=NYTNadler /&gt;

==Personal life==
He was married to Floria V. Lasky; they had two daughters, Emily Altman Heaps and Dara Altman Lennon.&lt;ref name=NYTAltmanObit /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/17/style/emily-m-altman-marries-alan-heaps.html New York Times: "Emily M. Altman Marries Alan Heaps"] June 17, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/24/style/dara-f-altman-is-married.html New York Times: "Dara F. Altman Is Married"] April 24, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1994 Bass obtained a court order to "formally oust the key managers of the Biosphere and seize the premises," and he dissolved Space Biospheres Ventures, a partnership, which the Los Angeles Times called a "volatile blend of New Age idealism and corporate sophistication."&lt;ref name=bannon/&gt; The Biosphere project had in 1992 installed an independent Science Advisory Committee (SAC), chaired by Thomas E. Lovejoy, a senior official at the Smithsonian Institution, and the members came to be at odds with Bass "on questions of scientific standards," and the science committee was dissolved in February 1993. Bass attempted to make [[Steve Bannon]] the interim chief executive officer.&lt;ref name=bannon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-24/news/mn-49890_1_biosphere-project/3 |title=Biosphere 2: Trouble in Paradise |date=1994-04-24 |accessdate=2017-03-28 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |author1=Hotz, Robert Lee |author2=Bauman, Adam S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existing management, however, refused Bannon admittance to the property, according to an affidavit Bass later submitted to a Fort Worth court, where he filed his dissolution suit.&lt;ref name=bannon/&gt;

In 1995, it was turned into a research facility overseen by [[Columbia University]], which declined to provide funding for continued research after June 2003.&lt;ref name="nytcolumbia" /&gt; In 2007, Bass sold some of the land adjacent to the project, and the building was leased to the [[University of Arizona]].&lt;ref name="wilson" /&gt; The total cost of the privately funded Biosphere project has been variously reported as $150 million&lt;ref name="nytreflect" /&gt; to $200 million.&lt;ref name="wilson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytcolumbia" /&gt; The University of Arizona announced a full acquisition of the Biosphere buildings and grounds in June 2011.&lt;ref name="UANewsBiosphere"&gt;{{cite news |title=Biosphere 2 to Have a Permanent Home With the UA |url=http://uanews.org/node/40358 |date=2011-06-27 |accessdate=2011-06-27 |publisher=Office of University Communications, The University of Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation efforts==
Bass has funded numerous projects focused on [[environmental conservation]], and has stated that he feels conservation "most effective when approached as an enterprise".&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news |author=Beatty, Sally |date=2007-10-05 |title=Gift of the Week: Millions for Wildlife From a Bass Brother |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |page=W2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His investment in Nepal also included conservation efforts for [[rhinoceros|rhinos]] and [[tiger]]s.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; He has supported and worked with [[World Wide Fund for Nature|the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)]], the [[New York Botanical Garden]], the [[Jane Goodall Institute]], and the National Environmental Education and Training Foundation.&lt;ref name=nytreflect/&gt;&lt;ref name=wwf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/wwf/annualreport07/ |title=World Wildlife Fund 2007 Annual Report |accessdate=2008-05-26 |page=64 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005053506/http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/wwf/annualreport07/ |archivedate=October 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=uaz&gt;{{cite web|title=Seven Honorary Degree Recipients to be Recognized During Spring Commencement |url=http://uanews.org/node/25469 |date=2009-04-29 |accessdate=2009-06-06 |publisher=[[University of Arizona]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently the vice chairman of the [[Botanical Research Institute of Texas]] and is the founder of the ecological nonprofit [[Philecology Trust]], which he created in 1986.&lt;ref name=uaz/&gt;

==Urban redevelopment==
Bass is a long-time supporter of downtown redevelopment, and has been described as a "leader in what is recognized as one of the most successful urban revitalization efforts in America".&lt;ref name=uaz/&gt; He and his family began the [[Sundance Square]] development in 1982.

==Life==
Eric Dent was raised in [[Boca Raton, Florida]], where he attended [[Saint Andrew's School (Boca Raton, Florida)|St. Andrew's School]]. After graduating, he attended Emory University, receiving M.S. and B.S. degrees in Computer Science. Dent then moved to Gaithersburg, Maryland where he worked for IBM, designing satellite communication systems. For several years Dent worked as a management consultant with Macro International. As Technical Director, he managed over $10 million of training and development contracts with the federal government. He most frequently consulted with [[The Royal Bank of Canada]], The [[United States Navy]], and [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]]. Dent later served as Vice President, Operations and General Manager of the Washington, DC office of the [[Todd Organization]], a national executive compensation consulting firm.

In 1993, Dent founded Always Improvement, a management consulting firm dedicated to organizational improvement. His recent work has been in the areas of executive coaching, organizational change, team-building, conflict resolution, strategic planning, [[total quality management]], leadership, and business process assessment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4685">'''European Works Councils''' (EWC) are information and consultation bodies representing employees in European [[multinational corporation|multinational]] companies.

== Purpose ==
The rationale behind the establishment of European Works Councils is related to the economic and political integration of the [[European Union]]. As companies became more transnational, the local information and consultation bodies (such as [[works council]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s) lacked a direct link to the level on which the real decisions are taken. As EWCs bring employee representatives of all over Europe together with the European management, they have an opportunity to be informed and consulted on the transnational companies strategy and status.

== Legal basis ==
European Works Councils are regulated by two European [[Directive (European Union)|directives]]. The first EWC directive was adopted in 1994 ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:31994L0045 94/45/EC]) and a revised [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] was adopted in 2009 ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32009L0038 2009/38/EC]). These directives are transposed into national legislation in all [[European Union]] and [[European Economic Area]] countries.

The adoption of the EWC Recast Directive came after a long period of discussion on the desirability of giving these councils extra rights and putting an extra burden on companies. In the end, the EWC Recast Directive adopted in 2009 contained some important changes regarding the definitions of information, consultation and transnational issues, included a right to training for employee representative and provided some more requirements for EWC agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0959680116685948|author=De Spiegelaere, S., &amp; Waddington, J.|title= Has the recast made a difference? An examination of the content of European Works Council agreements | doi=10.1177/0959680116685948 | journal=European Journal of Industrial Relations|page=095968011668594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Companies ==
European Works Councils can be established in multinationals operative in more than two EEA countries if they pass a certain threshold of number of employees. Currently, the company (or the group of companies) needs to employ at least 1000 employees in the EEA and at least 150 employees in two member states. If a company passes these thresholds, an initiative can be taken by the employer or the employees to establish a European Works Council.

After such an initiative, a Special Negotiation Body enters into negotiation on the practicalities of the European Works Council: the composition, the competences, the amount of meeting, the need for translation and interpretation in the meetings and much more. This negotiation results in an EWC agreement which forms the basis for all EWC functioning.

== Current situation ==
Since the first Directive on European Works Councils was adopted, over a 1000 EWCs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ewcdb.eu/stats-and-graphs|title = STATS &amp; GRAPHS|website = ewcdb.eu|access-date = 2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been created. According to estimations, they would cover an estimated amount of 19 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/netuf/2015/12/18/european-works-councils-progress-and-a-long-road-ahead/|title = European Works Councils: progress and a long road ahead|date = 2015-12-18|website = NETUF|language = en-US|access-date = 2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; employees in the EEA. Most EWCs are established in companies from the metal, chemical and services industries. Geographically, most EWCs are established in companies headquartered in Germany, the US, France and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etui.org/Publications2/Books/European-Works-Councils-and-SE-Works-Councils-in-2015.-Facts-and-figures|title=De Spiegelaere, S., &amp; Jagodzinski, R., (2015).

According to the EWC Recast Directive, the implementation of the Directive was to be evaluated no later than 5 June 2016. This evaluation was however postponed to the end of 2016 and further postponed to 2017. In the meantime, several evaluation studies have been published from the [https://www.etuc.org/sites/www.etuc.org/files/publication/files/europeanworks_councils_ces_01.pdf ETUC], the [https://soc.kuleuven.be/ceso/wo/erlm/files/permewc-final-report-eng Leuven University] and the [http://www.etui.org/Publications2/Reports/Too-little-too-late-Evaluating-the-European-Works-Councils-Recast-Directive ETUI].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10810">'''Global Management Challenge''' ('''GMC''') is a strategic management competition for managers and university students. Participants form teams of 3-5 members, and each team is placed in a group of 5-8 teams, depending the competition. The teams are then given a virtual company, initially identical to every other company in the competition. Each team then develops their company by making a series of decisions relating to every aspect of the business, such as how many machines to buy, or how much to spend on advertising. In each round, five sets of decisions are taken, corresponding to five quarters. A quarter is a period said to span three months.

These decisions - made on the Decision Sheet - are run through sophisticated business simulation software, which generates in-depth Management Reports, showing the consequences of the decisions. The aim is to finish the game with the highest share-price on the virtual stock exchange.

The competition is divided into rounds with usually 3 or 4 rounds on national level and 2 rounds on international level. The number of national rounds can vary in each country and depends on number of participants. Some countries use slightly different approach and combine Global Management Challenge with other competitions. In India teams compete in another competition which is more sector related (e.g. they run a car manufacturing company) and the last 8 teams join GMC national final. Also in Germany the participants play GMC only in their final round. As it might seem interesting it brings disadvantage to those teams because they are not so familiar with the simulation compared to other teams on the international level.

== History ==

The concept of the competition emerged in 1980 in Portugal by SDG – Simuladores e Modelos de Gestão – in partnership with [[Expresso (Portuguese newspaper)|Expresso]], a weekly newspaper.  The GMC computer model was designed by [http://www.edit515.co.uk Edit 515 Limited], registered in [[Scotland]], U.K.  It is updated frequently to reflect real world trading conditions and business risks, the aim being to present competitors with very realistic and complex business scenarios, with varied challenges and problems.

The Global Management Challenge is now the world's biggest strategic management competition - 20000 participants annually. More than 400,000 university students and company managers around the world participated since 1980.

Thirty-three countries currently participate in the contest: [[Angola]], [[Australia]], [[Belarus]], [[Belgium]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Ghana]], [[Greece]], [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong SAR (China)]], [[Hungary]], [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Latvia]], [[Macau|Macau SAR (China)]], [[Mexico]], [[Morocco]], [[People's Republic of China]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Singapore]], [[Slovakia]], [[Spain]], [[Turkey]], [[Ukraine]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Venezuela]].

For the 2010-2011 session, two new African countries are entering the contest: [[Ivory Coast]], [[Benin]], in partnership with Educarriere.net, a leading website in Ivory Coast which have been famous because it used to publish the result of many exams.

Each country organizes its own National competition, the model producing all material in the language of that country. The winners of the National competition meet to contest the International Semi-Finals and, if successful, go on to compete in the International Final (with results still in each of the countries' native language).

== World Champions ==
In 1980—the first year of the competition—only Portuguese teams competed. For the next two years, the GMC winner was decided by a Luso-Brazilian final, between Portugal and Brazil. Brazil won in 1981 and Portugal won in 1982. Since 1983, the winner has been decided at an International Final, hosted by one of the competing countries. The winners of each year's competition are listed below:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldgmc.com/index.php?cid=*F3350FAB648C17BC17B2A62C690F1370BCD6171C&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3307">'''Günter Herlitz''' (February 9, 1913 – September 11, 2010&lt;ref&gt;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, September 14th, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;) was born in [[Berlin]] as the son of [[:de:Carl Herlitz|Carl Herlitz]], founder of the [[Herlitz|Herlitz stationery company]].

==Biography==
Following the founding of the company by his father in 1904, Günter Herlitz took over the business in 1935. He expanded the company from Berlin into [[Province of Brandenburg|Mark Brandenburg]] and already counted six employees to help with the business. When he was conscripted for military service during the Second World War, Günter Herlitz’s mother took on the running of the business.

During the Second World War, the business premises were destroyed by bombs several times, and thus Günter Herlitz resumed business operations in 1945, following completion of his military service, in a basement in the Berlin district of [[Moabit]]. Initially selling bargains of all kinds, the Herlitz company was the only one of around 20 Berlin wholesalers to succeed in securing a minimal amount of goods during the [[Berlin Blockade]]. When the blockade ended, the company extended its product range considerably. As one of the most important wholesale firms nationwide, Herlitz was able to employ 50 people by 1950.

Due to the political situation in Germany at the time, it became increasingly difficult for the company to get its goods from West Germany to Berlin. As a result, Günter Herlitz decided to manufacture his own stationery. The company began with the production of exercise books, drawing pads and index cards. In 1955, the company was already processing 60 tons of paper each month. Even though the political situation at the time initially prevented Herlitz from supplying customers outside [[West Berlin]], the company was able to boast an annual turnover circa 1.1 million Euro.

Initial attempts to sell the products on the West German market were unsuccessful; however, in 1960, the breakthrough came about with notebooks and drawing pads with illustrated covers, which was an absolute novelty at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Der Tagessiegel, October 27th, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years, from 1960 to 1994, the company was able to double its turnover each year. This meant an increase in annual turnover from 2 million Euros in 1960 to 885 million Euros in 1994.

In 1996, Günter Herlitz was honoured for his life’s work at the company’s general meeting and resigned from the board of management. He became the company’s honorary chairman. From then on, he never attended another general meeting of the company.

To this day, the company headquarters are located in Berlin.

After the death of Günter Herlitz in September 2010, his family continues his social commitment and is amongst the most active families in Berlin. In 2003 his son, [[Klaus and Eva Herlitz|Dr Klaus Herlitz]] and his wife founded the [[Buddy Bear Help]] children's charities organization.

[[File:Hotel Wolcott from west.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Hotel Wolcott as seen from the west]]

The '''Hotel Wolcott''' at 4 [[31st Street (Manhattan)|West 31st Street]] between [[Fifth Avenue|Fifth]] and [[Avenue of the Americas|Sixth]] Avenues in the [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown East]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], was built between 1902 and 1904 by developer William C. Dewey and was designed by the prominent architect [[John H. Duncan]], who employed a bold French [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style combined with French [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo Classicism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Architects' and Builders' Magazine''(September 1903)&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel was named after Henry Roger Wolcott, a businessman, politician and philanthropist.&lt;ref name=desrep&gt;[[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] [http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/2423.pdf "Hotel Wolcott Designation Report"], (December 20, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hotel Wolcott entrance.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The entrance to the Hotel Wolcott]]

Before it was even completed, the building was leased by Dewey to James H. Breslin, a prominent hotelier of the time, for three years. Nonetheless, Dewey had difficulty with the financing for the building: unable to purchase steel locally, he imported it from Europe, which caused an unusually long construction period, which in turn made it difficult for Dewey to pay his creditors. In early 1905 The American Mortgage Company repossessed the building, which was sold at auction. Breslin's lease remained, but the hotel passed through the hands of a series of owners in the following decades.&lt;ref name=desrep /&gt;

The hotel was popular with travelers, but also housed many permanent residents, including dancer [[Isadora Duncan]] and [[Doris Duke]], the heiress. Other prominent guests of the hotel included [[Edith Wharton]] and [[Henry Miller]], and [[Buddy Holly]] and the [[Everly Brothers]] stayed there while recording at Beltone Studios, which was in the building. The hotel also hosted events such as the meeting where [[Jacob Ruppert|Col. Jake Ruppert]] and [[Tillinghast Huston|Col. Tillinghast Huston]] purchased the [[New York Yankees]] in 1914 and [[Fiorello La Guardia]]'s inauguration ball in 1938.&lt;ref name=desrep /&gt;

On December 20, 2011 the hotel was designated a [[List of New York City Landmarks|New York City landmark]] by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]].&lt;ref name=desrep /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3487">'''Jan Hugo Isidoor Coene''' (born in 1957), is a Belgian businessman who fell in disgrace because of the Picanol Scandal. 

As a young trainee, he joined [[Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie]] (BBC) Workshops in Brussels. In 1988, BBC merged with [[ASEA]], to become [[ABB Asea Brown Boveri]]. In 2001 he left ABB and became the CEO &amp; Chairman of [[Picanol]], a world-wide leader in textile machinery and related services.

In 2003, he became Chairman of [[Belgacom]], the Belgian national telephone company which he led to an [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]], working closely with its owner, the Belgian Government.

In 2004, the press revealed the level of his incomes from [[Picanol]].&lt;ref name="rtbf"&gt;Source: [http://old.rtbf.be/rtbf_2000/bin/view_something.cgi?type=article&amp;id=0168529_article&amp;menu=default&amp;pub=RTBF.PORTAIL%2FPORTAIL.FR.la_taille.SP.SOCI   RTBF.be's article (in french)]&lt;/ref&gt; These incomes were judged greatly excessive by the press, considering the usual Belgian remunerations for the functions of upper management. The lack of transparency was also pointed out, in particular by company's minority shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://www.deminor.com/articles.do?id=3591 Deminor's article (in french)]&lt;/ref&gt; Facing growing criticism, Jan Coene was forced to resign from both [[Picanol]] and [[Belgacom]] in October 2004.&lt;ref name="essent"&gt;Source: [http://cours.funoc.be/essentiel/article/article.php?idart=215&amp;id_result=Pierre-Henry%20Thomas L'Essentiel's article]&lt;/ref&gt; He accepted to reimburse ten million euros to [[Picanol]] (which because of the height of the sums reserved for Jan Coene had become financially unhealthy) but kept 12 million.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://www.hrmblogs.net/blogs.asp?iid=A64] HumanResourcesBlog (HMR Blog - in dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

The affair became a political issue in Belgium and a bill was introduced in Parliament (the "Picanol law") to force big companies to publish the remuneration of their upper management personnel.

In the meanwhile, the affair also shed another bad light on the Network of Vlerick-Boys, a circle of business men with low moral standards who all studied at the Vlerick Management School.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=GN19NUFI  Series of Articles Het Nieuwsblad (in dutch)]&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the circle include Jan Coene, Ronald Everaert, Luc Debruyckere and Louis Verbeke, who were all implied in scandals of greed, mismanagement and fraude (Lernout &amp; Hauspie, Ter Beke, Picanol).&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=GN19NUG3  Article Series Het Nieuwsblad (in dutch)]&lt;/ref&gt; The circle entertains business connections and helps its members to get in the direction committees of Belgian industry. As one of the only remaining "clean managers" Jan Coene was named president of the alumni of the Vlerick Management School. But he also had to quit presidency after the 2004 Picanol scandal.

Other of Jan Coene's professional activities include: Director and Board Member of various companies: Domo, Committee Koning Boudenwijnsticthing, Flanders, Federation of Flemish Enterprises, co-founder of BBE (Belgian Business for Europe), member of the World Economic Forum (since 2002), Chairman of Siveco Group SA, a company providing [[CMMS]] products worldwide.

Jan Coene is married with 2 children.

{{eastern name order|Kóka János}}
'''János Kóka''' (born 5 July 1972) is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] businessman, private investor, IT entrepreneur and manager of various enterprises, who served as Minister of Economy and Transport between 2004 and 2007. He was a member of the [[Alliance of Free Democrats]] (SZDSZ) and functioned as its chairman from 2007 to 2008. He also served as leader of the liberal party's parliamentary group until [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2010|2010]], when SZDSZ failed to win any seats after 20 years. Kóka left the party that year. In 2010 he returned to business life and presently works as Chairman and CEO of Cellum Global Zrt. and Chairman of the Board of Cellum Bulgaria. He is married to Edit Varga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.origo.hu/teve/20160503-varga-edit-interju-2016-virtuozok-jatek-hatarok-nelkul-hirado-mtv-duna-tv.html|title=Varga Edit: Otthon és a képernyőn is van értelmes feladatom|work=[[Origo (website)|Origo]]|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
He graduated from Temesvári Pelbárt Franciscan Grammar School in [[Esztergom]].  He continued his studies at [[Semmelweis University]] of Medicine, where he received his degree in 1996.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Business career==
Kóka got involved in the emerging Hungarian IT industry while still at university, working as Project Manager and later Sales Director at one of Hungary's first [[Internet Service Provider|ISPs]], Elender LLC from 1994 and 1996. From 1996 he served as Managing Director of Elender Computer LLC, then from 1998, following the company's transformation into a private limited company, as CEO of Elender IT, Inc. In 1999 Elender was acquired by [[PSINet|PSINet, Inc.]] and Kóka became Country Manager, then from 2000 European Vice President of Business Development. He also became Chairman of the Board of Webigen Inc. in July 2000. He returned to his former company in October 2002, serving as CEO of Elender Business Communications. In 2004 he was appointed President of Euroweb Internet Service Provider Inc.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

He was a board member of the ICT Association of Hungary (IVSZ) from 2000, and President from March 2003 until October 2004. From 2003 prior to his ministerial appointment he served as Member of the Board of EICTA (European ICT Association) based in Brussels, and Chairman of the Hungarian-Indonesian Joint Business Council. In 2000 he received the ’IT Manager of the Year’ award founded by the ICT Association of Hungary.

==Political career==
In October 2004, Kóka was appointed Minister of Economy and Transport, supported by [[Alliance of Free Democrats|SZDSZ]], which he later became a member of in 2006. During this period his main tasks included the development of a business-friendly environment, stimulating the growth of the corporate sector, promoting a knowledge-based economy and increasing the international presence of domestic businesses. In June 2006 he was reappointed Minister of Economy and Transport. Between 2007-2008 he served as President of the Liberal Party, and until 2010 as parliamentary group leader, member of the Budget Committee, and Chairman of the Nabucco Committee aiming to reduce the country's reliance on Russian gas.

His popularity began to drop in 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.szondaipsos.hu/hu/polvelkut/politikusok Politikusok népszerűsége] – A Szonda Ipsos honlapján&lt;/ref&gt; following the announcement of his Ministry's intention to shut down 14 regional lines of [[Hungarian State Railways]] on a total length of {{convert|474|km|abbr=on}}. The government, referring to obligation under the constitution, ensured access to public transit in all settlements by installing bus routes and buses from Volán, which, in cases of single railway stations for multiple villages, meant stations in the centers or ends of every settlement. It was expected that this and an increased service frequency could theoretically be achieved while reducing spending on fuel (diesel or electricity) and maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://index.hu/gazdasag/magyar/szemsz060705/ | title = Hív a vasút, zár a MÁV | work = Index | date = 2006-07-05 | accessdate = 2007-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considers the most important achievements of his ministerial activities to be the construction of 500&amp;nbsp;km of motorway, the influx of EUR 4-5 billion of operating capital annually into the country and the commencement of the construction of Megyeri Bridge.

On March 31, 2008, various reform-related disagreements between the [[Hungarian Socialist Party]] (MSZP) and SZDSZ led SZDSZ leader Kóka to announce that his party would quit the coalition by May 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080331/wl_nm/hungary_politics_dc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414164602/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080331/wl_nm/hungary_politics_dc |archivedate=April 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This also meant that MSZP would have to form the first [[minority government]] in [[Hungary]] since the political transition in 1990. However, the legitimacy of Kóka's position as party president became questioned when it was discovered that some signatures of the delegates to the assembly electing him had been forged. Since he had won his position by a very small margin over [[Gábor Fodor (politician)|Gábor Fodor]], these votes might have changed the outcome. Consequently, a new leadership election was held in June &lt;ref&gt;[http://nol.hu/cikk/488203/]&lt;/ref&gt; and Gábor Fodor was returned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://index.hu/politika/belfold/szdszpp08070/ Fodor nyerte az elnökválasztást] Index, 2008. június 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the parliamentary group he led ensured the majority of votes to elect [[Gordon Bajnai]] Prime Minister and facilitate the measures taken by the Bajnai Government. He did not run during the parliamentary elections in 2010 and he did not renew his party membership either.

==Post-political career==
After leaving politics in 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://hvg.hu/itthon.partonbelul/20100627_szdsz_szabadai_ujratervezes Az ősbölények leléptek – SZDSZ küldöttgyűlés], hvg.hu, 2010. június 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Kóka returned to the business world. First he was involved in the reorganization of Cellum Group as a consultant, then in 2011 he was appointed Chairman and CEO of Cellum Global Inc., established with the aim of international expansion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nol.hu/lap/gazdasag/20110910-koka_janos_visszatert Kóka János visszatér] – Népszabadság 2011. szeptember 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirszerzo.hu/profit/20110915_bulgaria_koka_cellum] – MTI 2011. szeptember 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.origo.hu/techbazis/hightech/20111025-mastercard-mobilba-koltozik-a-bankkartya.html Az sms mellett pénzt is küldhetünk a mobillal] – Origo, 2011. 10. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the representative of the company, in September 2011, he concluded a venture capital program agreement with Portfolion Zrt., member of [[OTP Bank]] Group, and soon afterwards he signed an agreement with Bulgaria's Corpbank on the establishment of a joint technological subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telecompaper.com/news/bulgarias-corporate-commercial-bank-to-offer-m-payments Bulgaria's Corporate Commercial Bank to offer m-payments], Telecom Paper, Friday 16 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Since January 2012 he has served as Chairman of the Board of Directors in the Cellum Bulgaria subsidiary, with its head office in [[Bulgaria]]. He is a board member in MPP Zrt., also a Cellum Group affiliate.  Under his management, the company has reported the conclusion of several international agreements of cooperation; for instance, Cellum developed the mobile payment application of [[MasterCard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepaypers.com/news/mobile-payments/mastercard-cellum-to-provide-mobile-payments-in-hungary/745654-16 MasterCard, Cellum to provide mobile payments in Hungary], The Paypers, Tuesday 25 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karl Mayländer''' (died early 1940s) was a Jewish businessman and [[art collector]] who was deported from Vienna to Lodz, in German occupied Poland, by the Nazis during the Second World War and later died in the Holocaust.

Mayländer was an art collector and critic who was a member of the board of the Volksheim Ottakring (later the [[Volkshochschule Ottakring]]), an adult education school which also hosted art exhibitions. Mayländer acquired the work of many young Austrian artists, including many drawings by [[Egon Schiele]] whom he knew personally.&lt;ref&gt;''Egon Schiele: The Ronald S. Lauder and Serge Sabarsky collections''. Prestel Publishing, 2005. p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art by Schiele owned by Mayländer has been the subject of restitution claims by his descendant in New York, Eva Zirkl, and in 2016 the [[Leopold Museum]] in Vienna agreed to return two watercolour paintings by Schiele to Zirkl.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.at/20160407/austrian-museum-returns-nazi-plundered-artwork Austrian museum returns Nazi plundered artwork.] The Local/AFP, 7 April 2016.

'''Kerry Ashby Gordy''' (born June 25, 1959) is a music industry executive and a member of the Gordy family of [[Motown]] fame. He is the son of [[Motown]] records founder [[Berry Gordy]], the half-brother of singer and rapper [[Redfoo]] and [[Rhonda Ross Kendrick|Rhonda Ross]], daughter of Motown legend [[Diana Ross]].

==Early years==
Gordy was born in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] the same year that his father, [[Berry Gordy|Berry Gordy, Jr.]], founded [[Motown]] Records. Gordy was brought home from the hospital to live in the historic home that housed the Hitsville Motown Recording Studios on West Grand Blvd. which was renamed Berry Gordy Jr. Blvd. Gordy’s mother, Raynoma, was a child prodigy in music and played eleven instruments and introduced him to music. Gordy followed in his mother’s footsteps and plays several instruments as well.

Gordy lived with his mother until the age of 13 and then moved to [[Los Angeles]] with his father Berry. He attended [[Beverly Hills High School]] with [[Benny Medina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.themarshallproject.org/2016/05/30/the-real-fresh-prince-of-bel-air-had-a-father-in-prison|title=The Real Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Had a Father in Prison|date=2016-05-31|website=The Marshall Project|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later Medina created the TV show [[Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]; a semi-autobiographical TV sit com loosely based on Gordy inviting Medina to move into the Gordy Estate in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]] when they were teenagers. Later the two wrote and produced records together for [[Motown]] and founded a teen idol band called [[Apollo (quintet)|Apollo]] for the Motown Records label. [[Teena Marie]] was originally in the group as the female lead, but dropped out before the band released their first single for Motown entitled ''Astro Disco''.

==Professional career==

Gordy's career began in 1973 working in the [[Motown Records]] mailroom. The early years of his career were spent in various administrative and creative capacities. Then in 1979, he released an album on Motown as a member of the group, [[Apollo (quintet)|Apollo]].  By the 1980s, he was known professionally as '''Kerry Ashby''' to separate himself at [[Motown Records|Motown]] from his father. He also worked as a writer and producer for various up and coming artists.

Later Gordy was promoted to the position of Director of [[A&amp;R]], where he worked on projects with artists such as [[The Temptations]], [[The Four Tops]], [[Rick James]] and [[Billy Preston]] among others. He also worked on compilation albums for [[Diana Ross]] and [[Michael Jackson]]. He became a Senior Executive for the Gordy Company (his father’s company after selling Motown) in 1988 where he was responsible for supervising Business Affairs, A&amp;R, Product Development, Administration and Personnel. Between 1991 and 1993 Gordy also consulted for [[Al Bell]]’s independently distributed label, [[Bellmark Records]]. 
 
In 1993, Gordy became the Vice President of two divisions for [[Paisley Park Records]], A&amp;R and Artist Development, (a joint venture between [[Time-Warner]] and the superstar "[[Prince (musician)|Prince]]"). He produced and co-wrote [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]]’s comeback hit "Paint the White House Black" utilizing icons of the rap and rock community such as Platinum artists [[Ice Cube]], [[Dr. Dre]] and the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. The following year, he orchestrated a joint venture between [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]’s N.P.G. label and [[Bellmark Records]]. This union again yielded a world wide # 1 smash single, "The Most Beautiful Girl In The World."
 
Gordy served as Vice President of A&amp;R for [[Warner Bros. Records]] Black Music Division, where in 1995 the [[R.I.A.A.]] (Recording Industry Association of America) awarded him with Gold records on [[Zapp and Roger]]'s "All the Greatest Hits" and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s "Come" Album. His production of "I’m Looking Out For You," was the theme song for "Real Stories of the Highway Patrol." It was broadcast six nights a week in over 190 markets, including [[CBS]] in [[Los Angeles]] and also aired on the REAL TV Network.
 
He managed [[Rick James]] from 1996 until Rick died in 2004. Prior to that, in 1994, Gordy Kerry negotiated and obtained a three-act production deal with [[Interscope Records]] joint venture partner B-Rite Records. The first release from that venture (Gospel Gangstaz) enjoyed success.

===Other ventures===
In 1998 Gordy partnered with Gordon Bizar under the name Gordy-Bizar to securitize artists' and publishers' royalties. Financing deals were signed with [[Alice Walton|Alice Walton's]] investment banking firm [[Llama Company]] as well as [[Lehman Brothers]].

In 2003 Gordy signed a deal with [[Clear Channel Entertainment]] to produce his company’s first theatrical. He also signed a worldwide deal with the [[William Morris Agency]] to be represented in that arena.
 
In 2004 Gordy co-founded Siebers Style with exercise guru Debbie Siebers who earlier that year struck a deal with [[Beachbody]] to sell the ''Debbie Siebers Slim in 6'' rapid weight loss program.  Debbie also became the fitness expert on the prime time reality show ''[[The Swan (TV series)|The Swan]]'' on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. Gordy negotiated two book deals for Debbie with Silverback Publishing entitled "Energy Boost" and "Nutritional Makeover". Gordy also started a fifty item clothing line for Debbie in conjunction with the Romar Group.

Gordy consults the "Writers Collective" and has also consulted for [[Stevie Wonder]].
 
In 2007, Gordy founded Kerry Gordy Enterprises, LLC, an intellectual property and branding company focused in entertainment. He has signed Debbie Siebers, Clark Anderson, and [[Reggie Benjamin]] to his company. He also closed a publishing deal for his long-time client, partner, and friend, [[Bruce Fisher]], songwriter of several number one hits including the ''[[You Are So Beautiful]]'' with Evergreen Publishing.
 
In 2008, Gordy teamed up with [[John Davis (producer)|John Davis]], to produce two urban genre movies.

In 2012, Gordy contributed to writing and executive producing on the entire season's episodes of the television series ''The Jadagrace Show''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5322">'''Junseok "Andy"{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Lee''' ({{ko-hhrm|이준석}}) is a South Korean [[entrepreneur]] and a founder of Edushare, an educational service organization. He was one of the 11-member [[Grand National Party]]’s (later Saenuri Party then [[Liberty Korea Party]]) Leadership Council, being the youngest member ever to sit on the Council that was given the power to overhaul the Party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20111228000921 26 year old grabs spotlight among new GNP leaders]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Lee studied in an American school in Indonesia for one year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/512645.html 한나라 비대위원 이준석 아버지, 유승민 의원과 친구]&lt;/ref&gt; and later attended and graduated from [[Seoul Science High School]]. Once admitted to [[KAIST]], Lee transferred to [[Harvard University]] and received a [[Bachelor's degree|B.A.]] in [[Economics]] and [[Computer Science]].

==Work Experience==
Lee interned as [[South Korea|South Korean]] lawmaker [[Yoo Seong-min]]'s assistant.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In lieu of military service, he did [[Alternative civilian service|alternative service]] at Innotive, an IT firm owned by [[Nexon]], as a junior [[software engineer]]. During his service he founded Edushare, a service organization similar to [[Teach for America]] to provide academic services to students who are a part of low-income families.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2011/12/116_101751.html Young start-up CEO steals show]&lt;/ref&gt; Lee first began the organization by an online plea in Seoul Science High Alumni website to recruit volunteers.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In 2010, he founded ClasseStudio, an online education [[startup company|startup]] along with the people he met at Innotive.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Grand National Party Leadership Council==
Handpicked by Rep. [[Park Geun-hye]], the party’s leading presidential candidate, Lee Jun-seok is the youngest ever to hold a leadership position in the history of the conservative ruling party. Being a part of the Leadership Council, Lee's role was to make key decisions on behalf of the party, including the selection of candidates to run in the parliamentary elections in April. Pundits view the appointment to appeal to the younger demographic and counter the surging popularity of [[Ahn Cheol-soo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arirang.co.kr/News/News_View.asp?nseq=124109&amp;code=Ne2&amp;category=2 GNP's New Leadership Holds First Official Meeting; DUP Pledge to Achieve Fair Elections]&lt;/ref&gt; Lee's background in computer science and a track record of public service resemble those of Ahn and some see that as the reason for the appointment. Lee remained as a member of [[Liberty Korea Party|Saenuri Party]] after Park Geun-hye became the [[President of South Korea]].

==After corruption scandal in 2016==
During [[2016 South Korean political scandal]], Lee harshly criticized the former president Park Geun-hye, whom Lee supported at [[South Korean presidential election, 2012|18th presidential election]]. Lee quit [[Liberty Korea Party|Saenuri Party]] (currently renamed as [[Liberty Korea Party]]) and joined [[Bareun Party]] with conservative lawmakers who had opposed Park.

==Controversies==
Lee's background and comments have been reported heavily in the Korean media upon his appointment.   Recently he asked the host of "[[I'm a Weasel]]", a progressive and popular podcast for political satire and criticism of the conservative Grand National Party, for help to investigate the political scandal that is plaguing the Grand National Party.  
[[Kang Yong-suk]], a national assemblyman made some attacks on Junseok Lee's qualifications.  The critics of the Grand National Party argue that Junseok Lee's old Tweets show his indifference to the average Korean and that he belongs to the upper elite as his Harvard education shows. Lee's tweet that stated "The National Council of the Victims of Forced Eviction must be mentally retarded" was viewed as evidence of his indifference and created particularly harsh criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biz.heraldm.com/common/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20111230000172 SBS 정성근 앵커, “이준석, 강용석과 같은 과”]&lt;/ref&gt; Lee apologized for the remark and his uncontrolled emotions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joongang.joinsmsn.com/article/834/7018834.html?ctg=1000&amp;cloc=joongang|article|outside_home 이준석 "박근혜, 의혹 신속히 털고 가야"]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a discrepancy between the 2009 numbers due to the various sources cited; i.e. the units sold by all ODMs add up to 144.3 million laptops, which is much more than the given total of 125 million laptops. The market share percentages currently refer to those 144.3 million total. Sources may indicate hard drive deliveries to the ODM instead of actual laptop sales, though the two numbers may be closely correlated.

'''M&amp;T Bank Stadium''' is a multi-purpose [[American football|football]] [[stadium]] located in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. It is the home of the [[Baltimore Ravens]] of the [[National Football League]]. The stadium is immediately adjacent to [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]], the home of the [[Baltimore Orioles]].  Often referred to as "Ravens Stadium",&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-10-11/sports/bal-mt-bank-stadium-is-named-one-of-the-toughest-venues-for-opposing-teams-to-play-in-in-the-nfl-20121011_1_m-t-bank-stadium-nfl-teams-theravens Ravens to M&amp;T Bank Stadium: 'Who loves ya, baby?'], Baltimore Sun&lt;/ref&gt; M&amp;T Bank Stadium officially opened in 1998, and is currently one of the most praised stadiums in the NFL for fan amenities, ease of access, concessions and other facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesportsroadtrip.com/baltimoreravens.html |title=Services |publisher=Thesportsroadtrip.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was originally known as '''Ravens Stadium at Camden Yards''', until [[PSINet]] acquired the [[naming rights]] in 1999, naming it '''PSINet Stadium'''. It then reverted to '''Ravens Stadium''' in 2002 when PSINet filed for bankruptcy. The naming rights deal for M&amp;T Bank Stadium was renewed for $60M over 10 years in 2014, extending the name through 2027.

==History==
Ground was broken for the new stadium in mid-1996, shortly after the arrival of the Ravens. The team played its first two years at [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]]. Although there was some sentiment from Baltimore residents in having the Ravens stay there permanently, it was deemed too old to host an NFL team. (The Orioles moved away from Memorial Stadium after the [[1991 Major League Baseball season|1991 season]].)

The stadium site was previously the site of the [[Wm. Knabe &amp; Co.]] piano factory, which closed during [[The Great Depression]]. A sidewalk keyboard mosaic on the southwest corner of the stadium honors the company's legacy.

In [[2003 NFL season|2003]], [[M&amp;T Bank]] acquired naming rights to the stadium. The bank had recently entered the Baltimore market with its purchase of Allfirst Bank. Two other companies were in the running to be granted naming rights to the stadium; they were reportedly [[Nextel]] and [[CarMax]]. Following the September 2002 death of [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]] [[quarterback]] [[Johnny Unitas]], public sentiment leaned toward renaming the then-sponsorless stadium after the Baltimore icon. However, the Ravens and the [[Maryland Stadium Authority]] held firm in their right to negotiate naming rights fees. In the end, the plaza in front of the main entrance to the Ravens' stadium was named "Unitas Plaza", complete with a bronze statue of the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]]. The plaza formerly featured large banners, each containing a picture of Unitas in his playing days, flanking the stadium entrance. After 10 years, these were replaced by large metal 19s (Unitas's number) for the [[2012 NFL season|2012 season]]. In 2014, the Ravens unveiled a new statue of long-time Raven [[Ray Lewis]] next to Unitas' statue. The bronze figure depicts Lewis in the final pose of his iconic "squirrel dance", which he would perform before every Ravens home game upon coming on to the field.

==Design==
The stadium contains five levels, being the lower bowl, club level, 300 suites level, 400 suites level, and the upper bowl. The lower bowl contains 42 rows of seats, split into two sections. The seats below the tunnel entrances are labeled from 1 to 18, while the seats above the tunnels are labeled from 19 to 42, except in sections 123-130, which contain rows 19-35, due to the press box taking up sideline space. On the club level, the rows are labeled from 1 to 13 on the sidelines, and 1 to 17 in the corners where no suites are located. In the upper bowl, the sideline seats are labeled from 1 to 32, while in the upper bowl end zones, the rows range from 1 to 26. Seat widths for the lower and upper bowls of the stadium vary from 19 to 21 inches, due to the curve design of the stadium, while the padded club seats range from 21 to 23 inches respectively.

The venue is served by the [[Hamburg Street (Baltimore Light Rail station)|Hamburg Street station]] of the [[Baltimore Light Rail]].

===Playing surface===

The stadium originally featured a natural grass surface. However, an artificial surface, Sportexe Momentum Turf, was installed for the [[2003 NFL Season|2003]] season, which in turn was replaced by a new-generation Sportexe Momentum 51 in [[2010 NFL season|2010]]. On December 4, 2015, the Ravens announced that in 2016 the team will go back to natural grass playing surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hensley|first=Jamison|title=Ravens Replace Artificial Turf at M&amp;T Bank Stadium|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-05-06/sports/bs-sp-ravens-turf-stadium-0506-20100504_1_turf-fields-lardarius-webb-ravens|accessdate=January 15, 2012|newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The listed capacity for M&amp;T Bank Stadium is 71,008.

However, when City College and Polytechnic joined the MPSSAA before 1994 season, the game was forced to be played in early November, due to MPSSAA rules and playoff schedule.

It served as Nextel Stadium, the home field for the fictional Washington Sentinels in the 2000 film ''[[The Replacements (film)|The Replacements]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2000/08/11/the-replacements-yet-another-replay/77ac5eaf-d037-402d-9be5-ef8cbb750b96/ O'Sullivan, Michael. "'The Replacements': Yet Another Replay," ''The Washington Post'', Friday, August 11, 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was also supposed to be the location{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} of the football game in the 2002 film ''[[The Sum of All Fears (film)|The Sum of All Fears]]'' and included footage of the presidential motorcade going to the building. However, the stadium used for the aerial shots is the domed [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]] in Montreal,{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} while the book used Denver as the locale for the attack.

It was featured in "Stadium," a 2013 [[television]] [[public service announcement]] which was part of the "I Want To Be Recycled" [[advertising campaign]] for [[Keep America Beautiful]] and the [[Ad Council]].

'''Marc Bolland''' (born 28 March 1959) is a Dutch businessman, who was the CEO of [[Marks &amp; Spencer]], after having been CEO of UK supermarket company [[Morrisons]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
He received a bachelor's degree from the [[Hotelschool The Hague]], and then an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] at the [[University of Groningen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/5741752/WM-Morrison-chief-executive-Marc-Bolland-on-how-he-has-transformed-the-supermarket-chain.html |newspaper=Telegraph |title=WM Morrison chief executive Marc Bolland on how he has transformed the supermarket chain |date=July 2009| accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heineken===
He began as a graduate at [[Amsterdam]]-based [[Heineken International]] [[Naamloze vennootschap|NV]], the third largest brewer in the world, in 1987. Bolland worked in various international management positions in Africa and Central Europe before joining the Heineken board in 2001. He became [[chief operating officer]] in 2005. Bolland has been credited with both building and rolling out the Heineken brand internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/788030.bolland_to_refresh_parts_of_morrisons/| newspaper=Bradford Telegraph and Argus |title=Bolland to refresh parts of Morrisons| first=Richard |last=Woodward |date=8 June 2006 |accessdate= 17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://2012-ny.bsr.org/en/speakers/view/marc-bolland| publisher=Business for Social Responsibility| title=Speaker: Marc Bolland| accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morrisons===
In September 2006, he was appointed CEO of the UK supermarket chain [[Morrisons]]. Morrisons had acquired [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]] in 2004 creating a 130,000 people strong retail conglomerate in the UK. The merger initially proved unsuccessful. Bolland joined after five profit warnings with a brief to turn round the company.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/18/marc-bolland-profile-marks-and-spencer| newspaper=The Guardian| title=High-flying Dutchman makes it to the top | first=David | last=Teather| date=18 November 2009 |accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2008 Morrisons had achieved strong growth in both market share and profits, and in 2008, Bolland was announced as The Times "Businessman of the year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.worldofceos.com/dossiers/marc-bolland| publisher=World of CEOs| title=Dossiers - Marc Bolland| accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/has-marks-spencer-boss-marc-bolland-failed-his-turnaround-plan-1449303| newspaper=International Business Times| title=Has Marks &amp; Spencer Boss Marc Bolland Failed in his Turnaround Plan?| first=Sean |last=Martin| date=20 May 2014| accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his guidance, Morrisons "...gained significant market share from rivals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ms-poaches-morrison-chief-to-be-ceo-2009-11-18| newspaper=Market Watch| title=M&amp;S appoints Morrison boss Marc Bolland CEO |date=18 Nov 2009| first=Aude
|last=Lagorce| accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marks &amp; Spencer===
In November 2009, it was announced that Bolland would become CEO of [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] Group PLC. In May 2010, he took over from the then chairman &amp; CEO [[Sir Stuart Rose]]. Bolland launched a plan to grow M&amp;S into an international multi-channel retailer.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; The [[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]] named Bolland as one of "London's 1000 most influential people" for 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-home/article-23897620-londons-1000-most-influential-people-2010-tycoons-and-retailers.do |newspaper=Evening Standard |title=London's 1000 most influential people 2010: Tycoons &amp; Retailers |date=15 November 2010 |accessdate=17 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303202728/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-home/article-23897620-londons-1000-most-influential-people-2010-tycoons-and-retailers.do |archivedate=3 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During September 2011, he announced a new look store environment for M&amp;S's UK stores, with a plan to complete the roll out to the entire UK estate by mid-2013. In 2011, M&amp;S returned to France after a 10-year absence and also started the development of a new digital platform that was launched in February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/apr/01/marks-spencer-paris-champs-elysees| newspaper=The Guardian| title=Marks &amp; Spencer makes Paris comeback with Champs Elysées store|first=Kim Willsher| last=Dan Milmo and Marie Winckler| date=1 April 2011| accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Bolland received an honorary doctorate from [[York St John University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honorary Graduates 2011 {{!}} York St John|url=http://www.yorksj.ac.uk/about/honorary-graduates/honorary-graduates-2011.aspx|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named as "Most Admired Leader" at Management Today magazine's "Britain's Most Admired Companies 2011" awards having been nominated by his peers in the FTSE 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/1107358| journal=Management Today| first=Rebecca |last=Burn-Callander| date=1 December 2011| title=Britain's Most Admired Companies 2011| accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Bolland was appointed as the Prince of Wales National Ambassador for Business in the Community and in Feb 2015 Bolland joined the board of Coca-Cola as a Director.

In January 2016, it was announced that Bolland would be retiring as CEO of Marks and Spencer effective April 2016, and would be replaced by [[Steve Rowe (businessman)|Steve Rowe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35249317| newspaper=The BBC| title=Marks and Spencer chief executive Marc Bolland to quit| date=7 January 2016| accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, it was announced that Bolland was appointed as a non-executive director of IAG (International Airlines Group).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/bolland-flies-in-to-british-airways-owner-iag-10258300|title=Bolland Flies In To British Airways Owner IAG|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/news/market-news/market-news-detail/IAG/12857177.html|title=Directorate Change - RNS - London Stock Exchange|website=www.londonstockexchange.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Patrick Donovan''' (23 December 1936 &amp;ndash; 11 March 2018) was a New Zealand [[amateur boxer]] and [[rugby union]] player. He represented his country in boxing at the [[Boxing at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956]] and [[Boxing at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Olympic Games]], and won bronze medals at the [[Boxing at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|1958]] and [[Boxing at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]]. He also played representative rugby for {{Rut Hawke's Bay}}.

==Early life and family==
Born in [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]] on 23 December 1936, Donovan was the son of Tommy Donovan, who won the 1927 New Zealand amateur featherweight boxing title, and then had 46 professional bouts between 1929 and 1935.&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=12012003 |title=Olympics boxer Paddy Donovan dies in Napier |date=13 March 2018 |work=Hawke's Bay Today |first=Doug |last=Laing |accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paddy Donovan grew up on his family's farm at Meeanee, and was educated at [[St John's College, Hastings]], where he was head boy.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

==Boxing==
Donovan won his first national amateur boxing title, in the featherweight division, in 1954, while he was still at school.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt; He went on to win the national lightweight title four times—in 1956, 1957, 1959, and 1962—and he was awarded the Jameson Belt for the most scientific boxer in 1956, 1959, and 1962.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

Donovan won the bronze medal in the men's 57–60&amp;nbsp;kg (lightweight) division at the [[1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]]. Four years later at the [[1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]] he again won the bronze medal in the same division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org.nz/athletes/paddy-donovan/ |title=Paddy Donovan |year=2018 |publisher=New Zealand Olympic Committee | accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He competed at two [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympics]], not making it past the first round of the lightweight division in [[Boxing at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956]] and [[Boxing at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]],&lt;ref name="SportsReference"&gt;{{Cite sports-reference | Paddy Donovan | https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/do/paddy-donovan-1.html | 27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was controversially omitted from the New Zealand team for the [[New Zealand at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympics]].&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

==1956 and 1964 Olympic results==
Below is the record of Paddy Donovan, a lightweight boxer from New Zealand, who competed at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics:

* Round of 32: lost to Toshihito Ishimaru (Japan) on points

Below is the record of Paddy Donovan, a lightweight boxer from New Zealand, who competed at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics:

* Round of 32: lost to Hector Pace (Argentina) referee stopped contest

==Rugby union==
A [[Rugby union positions#Scrum-half|halfback]] and [[Rugby union positions#Fly-half|first five-eighth]], Donovan played for the {{Rut Hawke's Bay}} rugby union team between 1955 and 1959.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

'''Paul Leopold Rosenfeld''' (May 4, 1890 – July 21, 1946) was an American [[journalist]], best known as a [[music critic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Brennan  |first=Marcia  |authorlink=   |title= Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Rosenfeld – An Aesthetics of Intimacy  |publisher=Rice University – History of Photography, Volume 23, Number 1, Spring 1999 |date= |url=https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/70695/An-Aesthetics-of-Intimacy.pdf?sequence=3  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in [[New York City]] into a German-Jewish family, the son of Clara (née Liebmann) and Julius Rosenfield. His mother was the granddaughter of brewer [[Samuel Liebmann]]. He studied at [[Riverview Military Academy]], [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]], and [[Yale University]], graduating in 1912.

After further education at the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]], he became a prolific journalist, writing on literature and art as well as music. He was one of the [[Alfred Stieglitz]] circle, and favoured an intellectually heavyweight and quite European approach. His friend [[Edmund Wilson]], writing two years after Rosenfeld's death, expressed the thought that his articles had become too uncompromising for the public taste, as time went by. Indeed, these days Rosenfeld is probably more famous for having inspired Wilson's tribute — republished in ''Classics and Commercials'' (1950) — than for anything he himself produced.

Magazines which published Rosenfeld's writing included ''[[The New Republic]]'', ''[[Seven Arts]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair magazine]]'', ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', ''[[The Dial]]'' and ''[[Modern Music (magazine)|Modern Music]]''.  He edited ''Seven Arts'' from 1916 to 1918, and was an editor of the ''American Caravan'' yearbooks.

''The Boy in the Sun'' (1928) was an [[autobiographical novel]].

The '''profit model''' is the linear, deterministic algebraic model used implicitly by most [[cost accounting|cost accountants]]. Starting with, profit equals sales minus costs, it provides a structure for modeling cost elements such as materials, losses, multi-products, learning, depreciation etc. It provides a mutable conceptual base for spreadsheet modelers. This enables them to run deterministic simulations or '[[What-if analysis|what if]]' modelling to see the impact of price, cost or quantity changes on profitability.

==Basic model==

: &lt;math&gt; \pi = pq - (F_n+wq) \, &lt;/math&gt;

where:

: {{pi}} is profit
: ''p'' is sales price
: ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is fixed costs
: ''w'' is variable costs per unit sold
: ''q'' is quantity sold

For an expansion of the model see below.

== Background ==
The justification for wanting to express profit as an [[algebra]]ic model is given by [[Richard Mattessich|Mattessich]] in 1961:
:'To some operations analysts the mere translation of accounting models into mathematical :terminology, without a calculus for determining an optimum, might appear to be a rather :pedestrian task. We are convinced, however, that as long as accounting methods are acceptable :to the industry the mere change to a mathematical formulation will be advantageous for :several reasons: (1) it can be considered a prerequisite for applying electronic data :processing to certain accounting problems, (2) it articulates the structure of the accounting :models and illuminates accounting methods from a new point of view, revealing many facets so :far neglected or unobserved, (3) it enables a general and hence more scientific presentation :of many accounting methods, (4) it facilitates the exploration of new areas, thereby :accelerating the advancement of accounting, (5) it leads to more sophisticated methods and :might help to lay the foundations for close cooperation of accounting with other areas of :management science.'&lt;ref name=Matt&gt;Mattessich, R. (1961). 'Budgeting models and system simulation', The Accounting Review, 36(3), 384–397.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the definitions in cost accounting are in an unclear narrative form, not readily associated with other definitions of accounting calculations. For example, preparing a comparison of fixed cost variances in stock under different stock valuation methods can be confusing. Another example is modelling labour variances with learning curve corrections and stock level changes. With the absence of a basic profit model in an algebraic form, confident development of such models is difficult.

The development of spreadsheets has led to a decentralisation of financial modelling. This has often resulted in model builders lacking training in model construction. Before any professional model is built it is usually considered wise to start by developing a mathematical model for analysis. The profit model provides a general framework plus some specific examples of how such an a priori profit model might be constructed.

The presentation of a profit model in an algebraic form is not new. Mattessich's model,&lt;ref name=Matt /&gt; while large, does not include many costing techniques such as learning curves and different stock valuation methods. Also, it was not presented in a form that most accountants were willing or able to read. This paper presents a more extended model analysing profit but it does not, unlike Mattessich, extend to the balance sheet model. Its form, of starting with the basic definition of profit and becoming more elaborate, may make it more accessible to accountants.

Most cost accounting textbooks &lt;ref&gt;Drury, C. (1988). Management and Cost Accounting, London: V.N.R&lt;/ref&gt; explain basic Cost Volume Profit modeling in an algebraic form, but then revert to an 'illustrative' &lt;ref&gt;Ijiri, Y. (1983). 'New dimensions in accounting education: computers and algorithms,' Issues In Accounting Research, 168–173.&lt;/ref&gt; approach. This 'illustrative' approach uses examples or narrative to explain management accounting procedures. This format, though useful when communicating with humans, can be difficult to translate into an algebraic form, suitable for computer model building. Mepham &lt;ref&gt;Mepham, M. (1980). Accounting Models, London: Pitmans&lt;/ref&gt; extended the algebraic, or deductive, approach to cost accounting to cover many more techniques. He develops his model to integrate with the optimizing models in operations research. The profit model comes out of Mephams work, extending it but only in a descriptive, linear form.

== Model extensions ==
The basic profit model is sales minus costs. Sales are made up of quantity sold multiplied by their price. Costs are usually divided between Fixed costs and variable costs.

Using:
* Sales revenue = ''pq'' = price × quantity sold
* Cost of sales = ''wq'' = unit cost × quantity sold
*Administration, selling, engineers, personnel etc. = ''Fn'' = fixed post-manufacturing overheads 
*Profit = ''π''

Thus the profit can be calculated from:

: &lt;math&gt; \pi = pq - (F_n + wq) \qquad\qquad (1) &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that ''w'' (average unit production cost) includes the fixed and variable costs.
The square brackets contain the cost of goods sold, ''wq'' not cost of good made ''wx'' where ''x'' = cost of good sold.

To show cost of good sold, the opening and closing finished goods stocks need to be included
The profit model would then be:

* Opening stock = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; ''w'' = opening stock quantity × unit cost
* Cost of stock = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''w'' = closing stock quantity × unit cost
* Cost of production = ''wx'' = unit production cost × quantity made:

: &lt;math&gt; \pi = pq - [F_n + wx + g_0 w - g_1 w] \qquad\qquad (2) &lt;/math&gt;

Presenting the profit calculation in this form immediately demands that some of the costs be more carefully defined.

=== Production costs ===
The unit production costs (''w'') can be separated into fixed and variable costs:

: &lt;math&gt; w = \frac{F_m + vx}{x} \qquad\qquad (3) &lt;/math&gt;
  
where

* ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; = manufacturing fixed costs;
* ''v'' = variable costs per unit; 
* ''x'' = production quantity.

The introduction of this separation of ''w'' allows for consideration of the behaviour of costs for different levels of production. A linear cost curve is assumed here, divided between the constant (''F'') and its slope (''v''). If the modeller has access to the details of non-linear cost curves then ''w'' will need to be defined by the appropriate function.

Replacing ''wx'' in (equation 2) and making ''F'' = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt; \pi = pq - [F + vx + g0w - g1w] \qquad \qquad (4) &lt;/math&gt;

=== Variable-cost elements ===
Moving on to other extensions of the basic model, the cost elements such as direct materials, direct labour and variable overheads can be included. If a non-linear function is available and thought useful such functions can be substituted for the functions used here.

The material cost of sales = m * µ * q, where

m is the amount of material in one unit of finished goods.

µ  is the cost per unit of the raw material.

The labour cost of sales = ''l λ q'', where

* ''l''  is the amount of labour hours required to make one unit of finished goods 
* ''λ''  is the labour cost (rate) per hour.

The variable overhead cost of sales = ''nq'' where ''n'' is the variable overhead cost per unit.

This is not here subdivided between quantity per finished goods units and cost per unit.

Thus the variable cost v * q can now be elaborated into:

: π  = pq - [F+(mµ q + l λq + nq)] …………(equation 5)

If the production quantity is required the finished goods stock will need to be added.

In a simple case two materials can be accommodated in the model by simply adding another m * µ. In more realistic situations a matrix and a vector will be necessary (see later).

If material cost of purchases is to be used rather than material cost of production it will be necessary to adjust for material stocks. That is,

: mx = md&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + mb - md&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;………… (equation 6)

where 
* d = material stock quantity, 
* 0 = opening, 1 = closing,  
* b = quantity of material purchased
* m = the amount of material in one unit of finished goods
* x = quantity used in production

=== Depreciation ===
All depreciation rules can be stated as equations representing their curve over time. The reducing balance method provides one of the more interesting examples.

Using c = cost, t = time, L = life, s = scrap value, Fd = time based depreciation:

: Depr/yr = Fd = c (s/c)(t-L)/L * [L(s/c)1/L] …………… (equation 7)

This equation is better known as the rule: Depreciation per year = Last year's written down value multiplied by a constant %

The limits are 0 &lt; t &lt; L, and the scrap value has to be greater than zero. (For zero use 0.1).

Remembering that time-based depreciation is a fixed cost and usage-based depreciation can be a variable cost, depreciation can easily be added into the model (equation 5).

Thus, the profit model becomes:

: π = pq - [F + F&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; + (mµ + lλ + n + n&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;)q]..........	(equation 8)

where, nd = usage (as q) based depreciation and π = annual profit.

=== Stock valuation ===
In the above, the value of the unit finished goods cost ‘w' was left undefined. There are numerous alternatives to how stock (w) is valued but only two will be compared here.

The marginal versus absorption costing debate, includes the question of the valuation of stock (w).

Should w = v or as (3) w = (Fm  + v x)/x.

(i)	Under marginal costing:  w = v. Inserting in (4),

: π  = pq- [F + v x + g&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;  - g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]

Becomes

: π  = pq- [F + v x + g&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;w&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;  - g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; v]

This can be simplified by taking v out and noting, opening stock quantity + production - closing stock quantity = sales quantity (q) so,

: π = p q - [F + v q]………….. (equation 9)

Note, v q = variable cost of goods sold.

(ii) Using full (absorption) costing
Using (equation 3), where xp = planned production, x1 = period production
w = (Fm + v xp)/xp = Fm/xp + v.
This can be shown to result in:

: π = p q - [F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; + v q + F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;/x&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; * (q-x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)]………..(equation 10)

Note the strange presence of 'x' in the model.
Notice also that the absorption model (equation 10) is the same as the marginal costing model (equation 9) except for the end part:
: F/x&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; * (q-x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)

This part represents the fixed costs in stock. This is better seen by remem¬bering q — x= go—g1 so it could be written

:F/x&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; • (g&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;—g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)

The model form with 'q' and 'x' in place of' g&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; allows profits to be calculated when only the sales and production figures are known.

A spreadsheet could be prepared for a company with increasing then decreasing levels of sales and constant production. It could have another column showing profit under increasing sales and constant production. Thus the effects of carrying fixed costs in stock can be simulated. Such modelling thus provides a very useful tool in the marginal versus full costing debate.

=== Modelling for losses ===
One way of modeling for losses is to use: 
 
*Fixed losses, (quantity) = δf, 
*Variable losses (%) = δv, 
*Material losses = mδ, 
*Production losses = pδ

The model, with all these losses together will look like,

: π = v q – [F + µ * mδf + {mµ(1 + mδv) + lλ+n) * (1+ pδ* (q +pδf)]........  (equation 11)

Note that labour and variable overhead losses could also have been included.

=== Multi-products ===
So far the model has assumed very few products and/or cost elements. As many firms are multi-product the model they use must be able to handle this problem. Whilst the mathematics here is straightforward the accounting problems introduced are enormous: the cost allocation problem being a good example. Other examples include calculation of break-even points, productivity measures and the optimisation of limited resources. Here only the mechanics of building a multi-dimension model will be outlined.

If a firm sells two products (a and b) then the profit model (equation 9),

: π = pq —(F +vq) becomes

: π = (pa *qa +pb *qb) - [F + va*qa + vb *qb]

All fixed costs have been combined in F

Therefore, for multiple products

: π = Σ(pq) - [F + Σ(vq)].... (equation 12)

Where Σ = the sum of. Which can be drafted as a vector or matrix in a spreadsheet

or

: π = Σpq - [F + Σ(Σmμ +Σlλ + Σn)q]..... (equation 13)

=== Variances ===
The profit model may represent actual data (c), planned data (p)or standard data (s) which is the actual sales quantities at the planned costs.

The actual data model will be (using equation 8):

: π = p&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;*q&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; - [F&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; + (mµ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; + lλ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; + n&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;)q&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;]

The planned data model will be (using equation 8):

: π = p&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;*q&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; - [F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; + (mµ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; + lλ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; + n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)q&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;]

The standard data model will be (using equation 8):

: π = p&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;*q&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; - [F&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; + (mµ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; + lλ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; + n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)q&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;]

Operating variances are obtained by subtracting the actual model from the standard model.

=== Learning Curve Model ===
It is possible to add non linear cost curves to the Profit model. For example, if with learning, the labour time per unit will decrease exponentially over time as more product is made, then the time per unit is:

: l = r * q&lt;sup&gt;−b&lt;/sup&gt;

where 
r = average time. 
b = learning rate.
q = quantity.

Inserting into equation 8

: π = pq - [F + (mµ + rq&lt;sup&gt;−b&lt;/sup&gt;λ + n)q]

This equation is best solved by trial and error, the [[Newton's method|Newton Raphson method]] or graphing. Like depreciation within the model, the adjustment for learning does provide a form of non-linear sub-modelling.

=== Percentage Change Model ===
Rather than the variable be absolute amounts, they might be percentage changes. This represents a major change in approach from the model above. The model is often used in the 'now that ... (say) the cost of labour has gone up by 10%' format. If a model can be developed that only uses such percentage changes then the cost of collecting absolute quantities will be saved.&lt;ref&gt;Eilon, S. (1984), ''The Art of Reckoning: analysis of performance criteria'', London: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The notation used below is of attaching a % sign to variables to indicate the change of that variable, for example, p% = 0.10 if the selling price is assumed to change by 10%,

Let x = q and C = contribution

Starting with the absolute form of the contribution model (equation (9) rearranged):

: π + F = C = (p — v)q.

The increase in the contribution which results from an increase in p, v and/or q can be calculated thus:

: C(l + C%) = [p(l+p%)- v(l + v%)]q(l+q%)

rearranging and using α = (p — v)/p,

: C% = ((l+q%)/α)[p%-(l - α)v%]+q%......	(equation 18)

This model might look messy but it is very powerful. It makes very few demands on data, especially if some of the variables do not change. It is possible to develop most of the models presented above in this percentage change format.

A '''secured creditor''' is a [[creditor]] with the benefit of a [[security interest]] over some or all of the assets of the [[debtor]].

In the event of the [[bankruptcy]] of the debtor, the secured creditor can enforce security against the assets of the debtor and avoid competing for a distribution on liquidation with the [[unsecured creditor]]s.

In most legal systems, secured creditors also have the option of releasing their security and proving in the [[liquidation]], although, in practice, they would rarely do so.

He eventually evolved into an events producer, which led him to be sought after to handle product launches and [[fashion show]]s.&lt;ref name="aj1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5122">In [[Germany|German]] [[corporate governance]], a '''''Vorstand''''' is the [[executive board]] of a [[corporation]] ([[public limited company]]). It is hierarchically subordinate to the [[supervisory board]] (''Aufsichtsrat''),&lt;ref name=Charkham&gt;{{cite book|title=Keeping Good Company: A Study of Corporate Governance in Five Countries|author=Jonathan P. Charkham|pages=14&amp;ndash;21|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-828987-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as German company law imposes a two-tier [[board of directors]].

German law confers executive powers on the executive board as a body. It is expected to act collectively and collegially. Unlike the [[Committee#Executive committee|executive committee]] (''aka'' operating committee or executive council) of a [[United States|US]] or [[United Kingdom|UK]] company, the executive board is not an adjunct of the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] (managing director). In contrast to [[Japan]]ese corporate governance, the German executive board has real decision-making power. It is, by law, the managing body of a company and cannot be instructed by any [[legal person]], be they natural or artificial, to act in such a way as to harm the business. Executive board members are personally liable for accepting any such instructions.&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt;

The specific scope of an executive board's duties varies from business to business. (A group of companies may each have their own individual executive boards, for example). The president of the executive board (i.e., the CEO) and the position's role are determined by the supervisory board. German law permits, but does not require, executive board members to elect a president/CEO from among their number.  There are no specific legal requirements regarding the CEO's role, or even for the title given to the holder of the CEO position, although in practice the most common title is simply ''Vorstandsvorsitzender'', literally, "''Vorstand'' chairman". A noticeable minority refer to their CEOs as ''[[wikt:Sprecher|Sprecher]]'' (lit., "[[Speaker (politics)|speaker]]"), implying that the CEO is no more than ''[[primus inter pares]]''&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt;; probably the best-known example for a company which uses this terminology is [[Deutsche Bank]].

The exact relationship between the CEO and the other executive officers depends on the company's type, how it was founded, and indeed the individual personalities of the people involved.  A family business could, for example, have a strong CEO who is a member of the founding family and exercises a great deal of power over the rest of the board.  In other companies, executive officers may hold themselves accountable to the executive board as a whole and not at all accountable to the CEO as an individual.&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt;

The relationships among executive officers can vary too. It is common practice for board members to be senior executives with specific areas of functional responsibility. However, the law requires that they oversee the activities of their fellow officers, since they are still personally liable for any failings outside their specific departments/subdivisions.&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt; Each board member has one vote.  Decisions are ''never'' escalated, when there is a lack of [[consensus]], to the supervisory board. Executive board meetings are commonly held on a weekly basis and can last up to a whole day.&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt;

Formally, the power to appoint executive officers to the board lies with the supervisory board, which can appoint officers with a two-thirds majority vote of approval, or a simple majority if multiple rounds of voting are required in order to reach a decision.  Since up to 50% of the supervisory board members are delegates of the employees (or even external trade union representatives, for details see [[Co-determination in Germany|Mitbestimmung]]), this prevents employees from blocking the appointment of executive officers to the executive board.&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt;

Executive officers have a certain degree of [[job security]], which is partly a preventative measure aimed at ensuring that executive boards are not dominated and that they are not "packed" with hand-picked appointees. Officers are usually appointed for the maximum statutory term—5 years. Removal must be for good cause, such as serious [[Breach of duty in English law|breach of duty]], and is subject to the supervisory board's veto. When an executive officer's ability to perform his duties is diminished due to old age, it is customary for him to serve out the remainder of his term but with a deputy to help perform his duties. Neither the shareholders nor the executive board can compel an officer to retire, whereas the supervisory board can.&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt;

Commonly, the CEO receives between 30% and 50% greater salary than that of the other executive officers. An officer's remuneration usually comprises 65% basic salary, and 35% that is equally split between annual bonuses and benefits.&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt;

{{Capitalism|Systems}}
'''Welfare capitalism''' is [[capitalism]] that includes social [[welfare]] policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/welfare%20capitalism |title=Welfare capitalism – Definition |publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |website=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welfare capitalism is also the practice of businesses providing welfare services to their employees. Welfare capitalism in this second sense, or '''industrial paternalism''', was centered on industries that employed [[skilled labor]] and peaked in the mid-20th century.

Today, welfare capitalism is most often associated with the models of capitalism found in Central Mainland and Northern Europe, such as the [[Nordic model]], [[social market economy]] and [[Rhine capitalism]]. In some cases welfare capitalism exists within a [[mixed economy]], but welfare states can and do exist independently of policies common to mixed economies such as [[state interventionism]] and extensive regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/files/Sweden%20Paper.pdf |title=The surprising ingredients of Swedish success – free markets and social cohesion |date=June 25, 2013 |publisher=International Economic Association |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
"Welfare capitalism" or "welfare corporatism" is somewhat neutral language for what, in other contexts, might be framed as "industrial paternalism", "industrial village", "[[company town]]", "representative plan", "industrial betterment", or "[[company union]]".&lt;ref name=ACWpreface&gt;{{cite book|author=Stuart D. Brandes|title=American Welfare Corporatism, 1880–1940|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|date=1984|isbn=0226071227|id=Preface|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 19th century, some companies—mostly manufacturers—began offering new benefits for their employees. This began in Britain in the early 19th century and also occurred in other European countries, including France and Germany. These companies sponsored [[sports team]]s, established [[social club]]s, and provided educational and cultural activities for workers. Some offered housing as well. Welfare corporatism in the United States developed during the intense [[industrial revolution|industrial development]] of 1880 to 1900 which was marked by labor disputes and strikes, many violent.&lt;ref name=ACW1-7&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stuart D. Brandes|title=American Welfare Corporatism, 1880–1940|date=1976|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226071227|pages=1–7|edition=Paperback edition 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooperatives and model villages===
[[File:New harmony vision.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Owen]] was a utopian socialist of the early 19th century, who introduced one of the first private systems of philanthropic welfare for his workers at the [[cotton mill]]s of [[New Lanark]]. He embarked on a scheme in [[New Harmony, Indiana]] to create a model cooperative, called the New Moral World, (pictured). [[Owenism|Owenites]] fired bricks to build it, but construction never took place.]]

One of the first attempts at offering philanthropic welfare to workers was made at the [[New Lanark]] mills in Scotland by the [[social reform]]er [[Robert Owen]]. He became manager and part owner of the mills in 1810, and encouraged by his success in the management of cotton mills in [[Manchester]] (see also [[Quarry Bank Mill]]), he hoped to conduct New Lanark on higher principles and focus less on commercial profit. The general condition of the people was very unsatisfactory. Many of the workers were steeped in theft and drunkenness, and other vices were common; education and sanitation were neglected and most families lived in one room. The respectable country people refused to submit to the long hours and demoralising drudgery of the mills. Many employers also operated the [[truck system]], whereby payment to the workers was made in part or totally by tokens. These tokens had no value outside the mill owner's "truck shop". The owners were able to supply shoddy goods to the truck shop and charge top prices. A series of "[[Truck Acts]]" (1831–1887) eventually stopped this abuse, by making it an offence not to pay employees in [[legal tender|common currency]].&lt;ref name="clayton"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nuspAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;ots=x2fIRmQvqi&amp;dq=%22a%20heterogeneous%20collection%20of%20radicals%22&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20heterogeneous%20collection%20of%20radicals%22&amp;f=false Robert Owen: Pioneer of Social Reforms] by Joseph Clayton, 1908, A.C. Fifield, London&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen opened a store where the people could buy goods of sound quality at little more than wholesale cost, and he placed the sale of alcohol under strict supervision. He sold quality goods and passed on the savings from the bulk purchase of goods to the workers. These principles became the basis for the [[cooperative store]]s in Britain that continue to trade today. Owen's schemes involved considerable expense, which displeased his partners. Tired of the restrictions on his actions, Owen bought them out in 1813. New Lanark soon became celebrated throughout Europe, with many leading royals, statesmen and reformers visiting the mills. They were astonished to find a clean, healthy industrial environment with a content, vibrant workforce and a prosperous, viable business venture all rolled into one. Owen’s philosophy was contrary to contemporary thinking, but he was able to demonstrate that it was not necessary for an industrial enterprise to treat its workers badly to be profitable. Owen was able to show visitors the village’s excellent housing and amenities, and the accounts showing the profitability of the mills.&lt;ref&gt;A. L. Morton. ''The Life and Ideas of Robert Owen'' (London, Lawrence &amp; Wishart, 1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen and the French socialist [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] were the fathers of the [[utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] movement; they believed that the ills of industrial work relations could be removed by the establishment of small cooperative communities. Boarding houses were built near the factories for the workers' accommodation. These so-called [[model village]]s were envisioned as a self-contained community for the factory workers. Although the villages were located close to industrial sites, they were generally physically separated from them and generally consisted of relatively high quality housing, with integrated community amenities and attractive physical environments.

The first such villages were built in the late 18th century, and they proliferated in England in the early 19th century with the establishment of [[Trowse]], [[Norfolk]] in 1805 and [[Blaise Hamlet]], [[Bristol]] in 1811. In America, boarding houses were built for textile workers in [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]], [[Massachusetts]] in the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reader's Companion to American History|year=1991|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co.|location=Boston|author=Barbara Tucker|authorlink=Textile Industry|editor=Eric Foner and John Garraty|page=1068}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The motive behind these offerings was paternalistic—owners were providing for workers in ways they felt was good for them.  These programs did not address the problems of long work hours, unsafe conditions, and employment insecurity that plagued industrial workers during that period, however.  Indeed, employers who provided housing in company towns (communities established by employers where stores and housing were run by companies) often faced resentment from workers who chafed at the control owners had over their housing and commercial opportunities.  A noted example was [[Pullman, Illinois]]—a site of a strike that destroyed the town in 1894. During these years, disputes between employers and workers often turned violent and led to government intervention.

===Welfare as a business model===
[[Image:Packing room, Bournville - Project Gutenberg eText 16035.jpg|thumbnail|right|The [[Cadbury's|Cadbury factory]] at [[Bournville]], c.1903, where workers worked in conditions that were very good for the time]]
In the early years of the 20th century, however, business leaders began embracing a different approach.&lt;ref name=Gilman/&gt; The [[Cadbury family]] of philanthropists and business entrepreneurs set up the model village at [[Bournville]], England in 1879 for their chocolate making factory. Loyal and hard-working workers were treated with great respect and relatively high wages and good working conditions; Cadbury pioneered [[pension]] schemes, joint works committees and a full staff medical service. By 1900, the estate included 313 '[[Arts and Crafts]]' cottages and houses; traditional in design but with large gardens and modern interiors, they were designed by the resident [[architect]] [[William Alexander Harvey]].

The Cadburys were also concerned with the health and fitness of their workforce, incorporating park and recreation areas into the Bournville village plans and encouraging [[human swimming|swimming]], [[walking]] and indeed all forms of outdoor sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Tolman  | first = W.

Rowheath Pavilion served as the clubhouse and changing rooms for the acres of sports playing fields, several bowling greens, a fishing lake and an outdoor swimming lido, a natural mineral spring forming the source for the [[lido (swimming pool)|lido]]'s healthy waters. The whole area was specifically for the benefit of the Cadbury workers and their families with no charges for the use of any of the sporting facilities by Cadbury employees or their families.

By 1914, the model village could house a population of 3,500. The garden village had allotments and public buildings including the [[Lady Lever Art Gallery]], a cottage hospital, schools, a concert hall, open air swimming pool, church, and a [[Temperance movement|temperance]] hotel. Lever introduced welfare schemes, and provided for the education and entertainment of his workforce, encouraging recreation and organisations which promoted art, literature, science or music.

Lever's aims were "to socialise and Christianise business relations and get back to that close family brotherhood that existed in the good old days of hand labour." He claimed that Port Sunlight was an exercise in [[profit sharing]], but rather than share profits directly, he invested them in the village. He said, "It would not do you much good if you send it down your throats in the form of bottles of whisky, bags of sweets, or fat geese at Christmas. On the other hand, if you leave the money with me, I shall use it to provide for you everything that makes life pleasant—nice houses, comfortable homes, and healthy recreation."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dta.org.uk/resources/history/historycontentsummary/industrial/ |title=William Hesketh Lever: Port Sunlight and Port Fishlight|publisher=Development Trust Association|accessdate=17 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America in the early 20th century, businessmen like [[George F. Johnson]] and [[Endicott, New York|Henry B. Endicott]] began to seek new relations with their labor by offering the workers wage incentives and other benefits. The point was to increase productivity by creating good will with employees. When [[Henry Ford]] introduced his $5-a-day pay rate in 1914 (when most workers made $11 a week), his goal was to reduce turnover and build a long-term loyal labor force that would have higher productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reader's Companion to American History|year=1991|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co.|location=Boston|author=John Steele Gordon|authorlink=John Steele Gordon|editor=Eric Foner and John Garraty|page=410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turnover in manufacturing plants in the U.S. from 1910 to 1919 averaged 100%.  Wage incentives and internal promotion opportunities were intended to encourage good attendance and loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Lizabeth|title=Making a New Deal|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Boston|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would reduce turnover and improve productivity. The combination of high pay, high efficiency and cheap consumer goods was known as [[Fordism]], and was widely discussed throughout the world.

Led by the railroads and the largest industrial corporations such as the [[Pullman Car Company]], [[Standard Oil]], [[International Harvester]], [[Ford Motor Company]] and [[United States Steel]], businesses provided numerous services to its employees, including paid vacations, medical benefits, pensions, recreational facilities, sex education and the like. The railroads, in order to provide places for itinerant trainmen to rest, strongly supported [[YMCA]] hotels, and built railroad YMCAs. The Pullman Car Company build an entire model town, [[Pullman, Chicago|Pullman, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="ACW10–19"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stuart D.

The economic upheaval of the Great Depression in the 1930s brought many of these programs to a halt.  Employers cut cultural activities and stopped building recreational facilities as they struggled to stay solvent.  It wasn't until after World War II that many of these programs reappeared—and expanded to include more blue-collar workers.  Since this time, programs like on-site child care and substance abuse treatment have waxed and waned in use/popularity, but other welfare capitalism components remain.  Indeed, in the U.S., the health care system is largely built around employer-sponsored plans.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Germany and Britain created "safety nets" for their citizens, including public welfare and [[unemployment insurance]]. These government operated welfare systems is the sense in which the term 'welfare capitalism' is generally understood today.

==Modern welfare capitalism==
The 19th century German economist, [[Gustav von Schmoller]], defined welfare capitalism as government provision for the welfare of workers and the public via social legislation. Western Europe, Scandinavia, Canada and [[Australasia]] are regions noted for their [[welfare state]] provisions, though other countries have publicly financed [[universal healthcare]] and other elements of the welfare state as well.

[[File:Medical Care Card USA Sample.JPG|thumb|right|A sample [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] card]]
Esping-Andersen categorised three different traditions of [[welfare state|welfare provision]] in his 1990 book 'The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism'; [[Social Democracy]], [[Christian Democracy]] (conservatism) and [[Liberalism]]. Though increasingly criticised, these classifications remain the most commonly used in distinguishing types of modern welfare states, and offer a solid starting point in such analysis. It has been argued that these typologies remain a fundamental heuristic tool for welfare state scholars, even for those who claim that in-depth analysis of a single case is more suited to capture the complexity of different social policy arrangements. Welfare typologies have the function to provide a comparative lens and place even the single case into a comparative perspective (Ferragina and Seeleib-Kaiser 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Welfare regime debate: past, present, futures|year=2011|publisher=Policy &amp; Politics|author=Emanuele Ferragina and Martin Seeleib-Kaiser|page=598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideal [[Social Democracy|Social-Democratic welfare state]] is based on the principle of universalism granting access to benefits and services based on citizenship. Such a welfare state is said to provide a relatively high degree of autonomy, limiting the reliance of family and market (Ferragina and Seeleib-Kaiser 2011).&lt;ref name="Emanuele Ferragina and Martin Seeleib-Kaiser 2011 584"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Welfare regime debate: past, present, futures|year=2011|publisher=Policy &amp; Politics|author=Emanuele Ferragina and Martin Seeleib-Kaiser|page=584}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, social policies are perceived as 'politics against the market' (Esping-Andersen 1985). [[Christian Democracy|Christian-democratic welfare states]] are based on the principle of subsidiarity and the dominance of social insurance schemes, offering a medium level of decommodification and a high degree of social stratification. The [[Liberalism|liberal regime]] is based on the notion of market dominance and private provision; ideally, the state only interferes to ameliorate poverty and provide for basic needs, largely on a means-tested basis. Hence, the decommodification potential of state benefits is assumed to be low and social stratification high (Ferragina and Seeleib-Kaiser 2011).&lt;ref name="Emanuele Ferragina and Martin Seeleib-Kaiser 2011 584"/&gt;

Based on the decommodification index Esping-Andersen divided into the following regimes 18 OECD countries (Esping-Andersen 1990: 71):

#[[Liberalism|Liberal]]: Australia, Canada, Japan, Switzerland and the US;
#[[Christian democratic]]: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany and Italy;
#[[Social democratic]]: Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden
#Not clearly classified: Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

These 18 countries can be placed on a continuum from the most purely social-democratic, Sweden, to the most liberal country, the United States (Ferragina and Seeleib-Kaiser 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Welfare regime debate: past, present, futures|year=2011|publisher=Policy &amp; Politics|author=Emanuele Ferragina and Martin Seeleib-Kaiser|page=597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Europe===
[[Image:VW Wolfsburg.JPG|thumb|The [[Volkswagen]] factory in [[Wolfsburg]]]]

European welfare capitalism is typically endorsed by [[Christian democrat]]s and [[social democrat]]s. In contrast to social welfare provisions found in other industrialized countries (especially countries with the [[Anglo-Saxon model]] of capitalism), European welfare states provide universal services that benefit all citizens (social democratic welfare state) as opposed to a minimalist model that only caters to the needs of the poor.

In Northern European countries, welfare capitalism is often combined with [[social corporatism]] and national-level [[collective bargaining]] arrangements aimed at balancing the power between labor and business. The most prominent example of this system is the [[Nordic model]], which features free and open markets with limited regulation, high concentrations of private ownership in industry, and tax-funded universal welfare benefits for all citizens.

An alternative model of welfare exists in Continental European countries, known as the [[social market economy]] or [[German model]], which includes a greater role for government interventionism into the macro-economy but features a less generous welfare state than is found in the Nordic countries.

In France, the welfare state exists alongside a [[Dirigisme|dirigiste]] mixed economy.

===In the United States===
Welfare capitalism in the United States refers to [[industrial relations]] policies of large, usually non-unionised, companies that have developed internal welfare systems for their employees.&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;Oxford Reference Online&lt;/ref&gt; Welfare capitalism first developed in the United States in the 1880s and gained prominence in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Tone, Andrea. ''The Business of Benevolence: Industrial Paternalism in Progressive America''. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoted by business leaders during a period marked by widespread economic insecurity, social reform activism, and labor unrest, it was based on the idea that Americans should look not to the government or to labor unions but to the workplace benefits provided by private-sector employers for protection against the fluctuations of the market economy.&lt;ref name=oconnor/&gt; Companies employed these types of welfare policies to encourage worker loyalty, productivity and dedication.  Owners feared government intrusion in the [[Progressive Era]], and labor uprisings from 1917 to 1919—including strikes against "benevolent" employers—showed the limits of paternalistic efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Lizabeth|title=Making a New Deal|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Boston|pages=160–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For owners, the corporation was the most responsible social institution and it was better suited, in their minds, to promoting the welfare of employees than government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Lizabeth|title=Making a New Deal|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Boston|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Welfare capitalism was their way of heading off radicalism and regulation then.

The benefits offered by welfare capitalist employers were often inconsistent and varied widely from firm to firm. They included minimal benefits such as [[cafeteria plan]]s, company-sponsored sports teams, lunchrooms and water fountains in plants, and company newsletters/magazines—as well as more extensive plans providing retirement benefits, health care, and employee profit-sharing.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Colin. ''New Deals: Business, Labor, and Politics in America, 1920–1935''. Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of companies that have practiced welfare capitalism include [[Kodak]], [[Sears]], and [[IBM]], with the main elements of the employment system in these companies including permanent employment, internal labor markets, extensive security and fringe benefits, and sophisticated communications and employee involvement.&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt;

==Anti-unionism==
Welfare capitalism was also used as a way to resist government regulation of markets, independent labor union organizing, and the emergence of a welfare state. Welfare capitalists went to great lengths to quash independent [[trade union]] organizing, [[strike action|strikes]], and other expressions of labor collectivism—through a combination of violent suppression, worker sanctions, and  benefits in exchange for loyalty.&lt;ref name=oconnor&gt;O'Connor, Alice. "Welfare Capitalism." Dictionary of American History. The Gale Group Inc. 2003. Encyclopedia.com. 3 Oct. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, employee stock-ownership programs meant to tie workers to the success of companies (and accordingly to management).  Workers would then be actual partners with owners—and capitalists themselves.  Owners intended these programs to ward off the threat of "Bolshevism" and undermine the appeal of unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Lizabeth|title=Making a New Deal|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Boston|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The least popular of the welfare capitalism programs were the company unions created to stave off labor activism.  By offering employees a say in company policies and practices and a means for appealing disputes internally, employers hoped to reduce the lure of unions.  They dubbed these employee representation plans "industrial democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Lizabeth|title=Making a New Deal|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Boston|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficacy==
In the end, welfare capitalism programs benefited [[white-collar worker]]s far more than those on the [[factory]] floor in the early 20th century. The average annual bonus payouts at [[U.S. Steel Corporation]] from 1929 to 1931 were approximately $2,500,000; however, in 1929, $1,623,753 of that went to the president of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Peace in Bethlehem|journal=The Literary Digest|date=August 1, 1931|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mickelsen|first=Gunnar|title=The Kohler Myth Dies|journal=The Nation|date=September 2, 1934|volume=139|pages=187–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real wages for unskilled and low-skilled workers grew little in the 1920s, while long hours in unsafe conditions continued to be the norm. Further, employment instability due to [[layoff]]s remained a reality of work life. Welfare capitalism programs rarely worked as intended, company unions only reinforced that authority of management over the terms of employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Lizabeth|title=Making a New Deal|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Boston|pages=186–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wage incentives (merit raises and bonuses) often led to a speed-up in production for factory lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Lizabeth|title=Making a New Deal|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Boston|pages=192–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As much as these programs meant to encourage loyalty to the company, this effort was often undermined by continued layoffs and frustrations with working conditions. [[Employee]]s soured on employee representation plans and cultural activities, but they were eager for opportunities to improve their pay with good work and attendance and to gain benefits like medical care. These programs gave workers new expectations for their employers. They were often disappointed in the execution of them but supported their aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Lizabeth|title=Making a New Deal|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Boston|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The post-[[World War II]] era saw an expansion of these programs for all workers, and today, these benefits remain part of employment relations in many countries. Recently, however, there has been a trend away from this form of welfare capitalism, as corporations have reduced the portion of compensation paid with health care, and shifted from defined benefit pensions to employee-funded defined contribution plans.
