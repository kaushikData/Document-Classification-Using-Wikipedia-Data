The [[Arab League]] 22nd Summit was held in [[Sirte]], in [[Libya]] on 27 March 2010.

Italian prime minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] spoke at the summit, stressing that [[Israel]] should return the [[Golan Heights]] to [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Berlusconi in Libya: Return Golan Heights to Syria|newspaper=Ynetnews|date=2010-03-27|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3868837,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] rejected pressure from Syria and Libya to quit the peace process.  His senior aide [[Nabil Abu Rdeneh]] said: "We are ready for any Arab option. If they want to go to war let them declare that and mobilize their armies and their people and we will follow suit."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hhsA9r1Y4zuh3pxw8aH5_CrXPwvQD9ENOCSO0 Arab leaders renew support for peace efforts]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''referendum on allowing President [[Alexander Lukashenko|Lukashenko]] to stand in further elections''' was held in [[Belarus]] on 17 October 2004, alongside [[Belarusian parliamentary election, 2004|parliamentary elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p252 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lukashenko was nearing the end of his constitutionally-limited two terms, and the change would allow him to run for a third term. The result was 88.9% in favour, with a turnout of 90.3%.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p257&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Caisse populaire Desjardins de l'Est de Drummond v Canada'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Caisse populaire Desjardins de l'Est de Drummond v. Canada|link=|year=2009|court=scc|num=29|format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[2009] 2 SCR 94|date=2009-06-19|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Canadian income tax law case of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] that has wide-ranging application to other areas of federal and provincial jurisdiction when dealing with [[recharacterization|cash collateral arrangement]]s and [[security interest]]s.

==Background==
In September 2000, Les Entreprises Camvrac Inc. was granted a [[line of credit]] of $277,000 by the [[Desjardins Group|Caisse populaire du Bon Conseil]] in [[Notre-Dame-du-Bon-Conseil, Quebec (village)|Notre-Dame-du-Bon-Conseil, Quebec]], and in return it made a [[term deposit]] of $200,000 which was neither negotiable nor transferable during the line's term. In the event of default, it was agreed that there would be compensation between the credit agreement and the term deposit.

In November 2000, Camvrac defaulted on the credit agreement and later made an assignment in bankruptcy. As it had failed to remit source deductions with respect to income taxes and [[employment insurance]] premiums, which are subject to a deemed trust under the ''Income Tax Act'' (Canada) and the ''Employment Insurance Act'', the Crown gave the Caisse notice to pay the amount owing to the Crown from the proceeds of the deposit. The Caisse challenged the recovery process, contending that its obligation applied only to the "proceeds from" the property subject to the trust, and that in reality it had not received any "proceeds from" the term deposit certificate.

==The courts below==
Mme [[Prothonotary]] Tabib of the [[Federal Court of Canada]], at first instance, held that the term deposit constituted a benefit to the Caisse, and by extension the "proceeds from a property" must be construed as including any set-off or benefit received in exchange or in consideration of the property. As she observed:

{{cquote|
[22] Thus the value of the benefit conferred on the defendant through the realization on its security interest in the certificate of deposit constitutes the proceeds from the certificate of deposit, and must be paid to the Receiver General. To conclude otherwise would allow secured creditors to elude the clear intention of Parliament by accepting, in consideration of the property held as security and also subject to the deemed trust, earnings or instruments that are convertible into cash, albeit not monetary.
}}

The judgment was sustained at a full trial in the Federal Court by [[Yvon Pinard|Pinard J]], and subsequently at the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] in a ruling by [[Gilles Létourneau|Létourneau JA]]. The Caisse appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.

==At the SCC==
The appeal was dismissed in a 5-2 ruling. [[Marshall Rothstein|Rothstein J]] wrote the ruling for the majority, and [[Marie Deschamps|Deschamps J]] delivered a detailed dissent.

===Majority ruling===
The primary issue was identified as to whether the Crown was the beneficial owner of Camvrac's term deposit to the extent of its liability to the Crown, under the deemed trust provisions of the Acts. Rothstein J held that it was:&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 8{{endash}}17&lt;/ref&gt;

:* s. 227(4.1) of the ''ITA'' declares that a deemed trust operates notwithstanding any "security interest" that may exist in property held by a taxpayer or a secured creditor
:* s. 224(1.3) provides for an expansive definition of a "security interest"
:* similar provisions exist in the ''EIA''
:* they are effective because "[f]or particular purposes Parliament can and does create its own lexicon,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Saulnier v. Royal Bank of Canada|link=|year=2008|court=scc|num=58|format=|pinpoint=par. 16|parallelcite=[2008] 3 SCR 166|date=2008-10-24|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is open to Parliament to define a term in an area of its own legislative competence
:* the current statutory régime was introduced to oust the previous patchwork of federal and provincial rules identified in ''Royal Bank of Canada v. Sparrow Electric Corp.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Royal Bank of Canada v. Sparrow Electric Corp.|link=|year=1997|court=scc|num=377|format=canlii|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[1997] 1 SCR 411|date=1997-02-27|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He further held that the right of compensation under ss. 1672{{endash}}1673 of the ''[[Civil Code of Quebec]]'' (analogous to the concept of [[Set-off (law)|set-off]] in the common-law provinces) can fall within the scope of a "security interest" as defined, but not in every case:

{{cquote|
[23] I do not think it is correct to make a blanket determination that a contractual right to compensation or a contractual right to set-off can never be associated with a "security interest" or that they are always associated with a "security interest".  Whether a contract providing for a right to compensation or a right to set-off also gives rise to a "security interest" within the meaning of s. 224(1.3) ''ITA'' requires that the terms of the contract be carefully considered to determine whether the parties intended to confer on one party or the other "any interest in property [of the other party] that secures payment or performance of an obligation".
}}

In the case at hand he held that it was:

{{cquote|
[30] It was the five-year term and the maintenance and retention of the $200,000 deposit, as well as Camvrac's agreement not to transfer or negotiate the deposit and that the deposit could only be used as security with the Caisse, that created the Caisse's interest in Camvrac's property for the purposes of s. 224(1.3) ''ITA''.  In the absence of these encumbrances on Camvrac's deposit, Camvrac could have withdrawn the deposit at any time. Should it have done so and still been indebted to the Caisse, the Caisse's right to compensation would be ineffective because it would not be indebted to Camvrac at the time the Caisse had to resort to the remedy of compensation. However, in this case the terms of the agreements provided that Camvrac agreed to the encumbrances on its deposit of $200,000 so that the Caisse would continuously be indebted to Camvrac and that on default there would be effective compensation.  It is the fact that the agreements secured the Caisse's right to effective compensation by conferring on the Caisse an interest in Camvrac's property that created a "security interest" for the purposes of s. 224(1.3) ''ITA''.
}}

===Dissent===

[[Marie Deschamps|Deschamps J]], in her analysis, held that the concept of "security interest" was not as broad as was expressed by Rothstein J:&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 78{{endash}}82&lt;/ref&gt;

:* the English and French definitions ("security interest" and "''garantie''") were not identical in scope, with the French definition being less precise
:* it is therefore important that the two versions be read together and that the meaning of the terms be harmonized
:* under the ''Interpretation Act'' (Canada), the law of the province is the relevant source
:* absent an express provision to the contrary, federal legislation must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the concepts and institutions of the legal system of the province in which it is to be applied

In that regard, the following observations can be made in how this should be applied in Quebec:&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 92{{endash}}105&lt;/ref&gt;

:* the common law concept of security interest therefore corresponds, in civil law terms, not to a personal right, but to a real right
:* in the ''CCQ'', the concept of real right includes forms of security that have been consolidated in the concept of the [[hypothec]]
:* the provisions relating to compensation fall within the ''CCQ'''s chapter on the extinction of obligations, and not in that relating to hypothecs
:* since compensation has not been included in the list of examples of what constitutes a "security interest" under the ''ITA'', the Caisse's right can constitute a security interest only if it entails a real right
:* the automatic extinction of mutual debts is an effect of compensation, but it does not constitute the enforcement of a real right in the property in question
:* the scope of the English term "security interest" is better expressed in French by the term "''sûreté''"

She would have allowed the appeal, and remanded the case back to the trial judge, as compensation cannot be considered to be a "security interest": the Caisse's contractual right may be set up against the Crown, because the Crown cannot have more rights than Camvrac itself had.

In response to Deschamps J's dissent, Rothstein J stated the following:&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 34{{endash}}55&lt;/ref&gt;

:* mutual obligations must exist for compensation to be an effective remedy
:* a contract containing a right to set-off can also confer on a creditor an interest in a debtor's property
:* while compensation does not appear grouped with hypothecs in the ''CCQ'', the issue is not whether compensation is a security interest: the list is non‑exhaustive, and so long as an agreement confers on a creditor an interest in property that secures the payment or performance of an obligation through compensation, the agreement will constitute  a "security interest" within the meaning of s. 224(1.3) ''ITA''
:* an agreement that provides for security together with a right of set-off to realize on that security is not expressly excluded in any of the common law [[Personal Property Security Act (Canada)|provincial personal property security statutes]]: what is required by them is a decision about whether a particular contract or agreement in a given case functions as a security interest. 
:* at both civil and common law, a claim, like a deposit, may be charged with a real right or become the subject of a creditor's interest in property
:* even if the obligation to maintain and the right to retain are residual and apply only after the five-year term of the deposit has expired, they are nonetheless encumbrances that could affect Camvrac's use of its property
:* the right of retention, the obligation to maintain and Camvrac's pledge not to hypothecate or use its term deposit as security in favour of anyone besides the Caisse were three of a series of encumbrances that created the Caisse's interest in or right over Camvrac's property to ensure that compensation would be an effective remedy.

==Impact==

The SCC ruling has proved to be controversial. Many legal scholars and commentators preferred Deschamps J's reasoning to that of Rothstein J's.&lt;ref name = "Holbrook"&gt;{{cite web|author = Deborah Holbrook|title = Cash Deposit Deemed a 'Security Interest' by the Supreme Court of Canada|url = http://www.airdberlis.com/Templates/Newsletters/newsletterFiles/126/Collateral%20Matters%20Dec%202009.pdf|publisher = Aird &amp; Berlis|date = December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the ''ITA'''s definition of "security interest" is quite similar to that embodied in the various provincial ''Personal Property Security Acts'',&lt;ref name="Dhowan"&gt;{{cite web|author = Sona Dhawan|title = Third party liability in insolvency cases favours Revenue Canada|url = http://www.thecourt.ca/2009/07/21/third-party-liability-in-insolvency-cases-favor-revenue-canada/|publisher = thecourt.ca|date = 21 July 2009|access-date = 2013-11-10|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090722185052/http://www.thecourt.ca/2009/07/21/third-party-liability-in-insolvency-cases-favor-revenue-canada/#|archive-date = 2009-07-22|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; lenders may be exposed to attack, not just from the [[Canada Revenue Agency]] but also from trustees in bankruptcy, and secured creditors from their depositors, if security interests are not perfected by registration in the common law provinces, or published as a movable hypothec without delivery in Quebec.&lt;ref name = "McMillan"&gt;{{cite web|author1 = Rob Scavone|author2 = Tobias Whitfield|title = Set-off or security interest? Supreme Court's expansion of enhanced federal deemed trust provisions raises some troubling issues|url = http://www.mcmillan.ca/Files/Set-Off_or_Security_Interest_1009.pdf|publisher = [[McMillan LLP]]|date = October 2009}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

This decision has the potential to have a significant impact on insolvency practice across Canada. By increasing personal liability, it widens the scope of liability where not only financial institutions, but all persons both dealing with tax debtors and receiving payments while a deemed trust exists, may be liable.&lt;ref name = "Dhowan"/&gt;

Cash collateral agreements commonly rely on what has been called a "triple cocktail" of set-off, security interest and "flawed asset". In effect, ''Caisse Populaire'' stands for the proposition that the first and third element of the "triple cocktail" automatically combine to form the second, even though the lender may regard them as conceptually distinct.&lt;ref name = "McMillan"/&gt;

Derivative agreements such as those embodied in [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association]] contracts may also fall within the scope of the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1 = James H.

A '''campsite''' or '''camping pitch''' is a place used for [[camping|overnight stay]] in an outdoor area. In UK English, a ''campsite'' is an area, usually divided into a number of pitches, where people can camp overnight using tents or camper vans or caravans; this UK English use of the word is synonymous with the US English expression ''campground''. In American English, the term ''campsite'' generally means an area where an individual, family, group, or military unit can pitch a tent or park a camper; a campground may contain many campsites.

There are two types of campsites:
* an impromptu area (as one might decide to stop while [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]] or [[hiking]], or simply adjacent to a road through the wilderness).
* a designated area with improvements and various facilities (see below).

==Campgrounds==
[[File:Tenting at Joseph A. Citta.jpg|thumb|250px|Semi-permanent [[tent]]s on [[Tent platform|wooden platforms]] at a scout camp]]
[[Image:Campsite-Oludeniz.JPG|thumb|250px|A campsite on [[Ölüdeniz]] beach]]
[[File:Gallanach Campsite - geograph.org.uk - 36570.jpg|thumb|250px|Undeveloped tent camping area]]
The term ''camp'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''campus'', meaning "field". Therefore, a '''campground''' consists typically of open pieces of ground where a camper can pitch a [[tent]] or park a [[Campervan|camper]]. More specifically a campsite is a dedicated area set aside for camping and for which often a user fee is charged. Campsites typically feature a few (but sometimes no) improvements.

Dedicated campsites, known as ''Campgrounds'',  usually have some amenities. Common amenities include, listed roughly in order from most to least common:
* Fireplaces or [[fire pit]]s in which to build [[campfire]]s (this can be a circle of rocks, a metal enclosure, a metal grate, a concrete spot, or even just a hole).
* [[Road]] access for [[vehicle]]s
* A gravel or concrete pad on which to park a vehicle
* [[Picnic]] tables
* Marked spaces indicating a boundary for one camper or a group of campers
* Reservations to ensure there will be available space to camp
* Utility hookups, such as [[electricity]] water, and [[sanitary sewer|sewer]], primarily for the use of [[Travel trailer]]s, [[Recreational vehicle]]s, or similar
* [[Tent platform|Raised platforms]] on which to set up [[tent]]s
* [[Plumbing|Piped]] [[Drinking water|potable water]]

Campgrounds may include further amenities:
* Pit toilets ([[outhouse]]s)
* [[Flush toilet]]s and [[shower]]s
* Sinks and mirrors in the bathrooms
* A small [[convenience store]]
* Shower facilities (with or without hot water)
* Wood for free or for sale for use in cooking or for a [[campfire]]
* Garbage cans or large rubbish bins in which to place refuse

Camping outside a designated campsite may be forbidden by law. It is thought to be a nuisance, harmful to the environment, and is often associated with [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]]. However some countries have specific laws and/or regulations allowing camping on public lands (see ''[[Freedom to roam]]''). In the United States, many [[national parks|national]] and [[state park]]s have dedicated campsites and sometimes also allow impromptu backcountry camping by visitors. U.S. [[United States National Forest|National Forests]] often have established campsites, but generally allow camping anywhere, except within a certain distance of water sources or developed areas. Camping may also be prohibited in certain ‘special areas’ of national forests containing unusual landforms or vegetation. And if conditions allow campfires, a campfire permit is required for campfires outside of developed campsites.

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], it is more commonly known as ''wild camping'', and is mostly illegal. However, [[Scotland]] has a relaxed view and wild camping is legal in the majority of Scotland.

In many parts of [[Canada]], "roughing it" is considered to be wilderness camping on government owned, public land known as [[crown land]] and commonly called "the bush". There are no amenities of any kind and typically no development except for possibly logging roads or ATV trails, and few rules beyond the requirement in some provinces to move the site at least 100 metres every 21 days.

===RV parks/caravan parks===
{{main|RV park}}
[[File:Legenda camping.svg|90px|thumb|A symbol used to indicate the availability of trailer or RV camping]]
In North America many campgrounds have facilities for [[Recreational Vehicle]]s and are also known as RV parks. Similar facilities in the UK are known as [[Caravan Park]]s. The [[Kampgrounds of America]] (KOA) is a large chain of commercial campgrounds located throughout the United States and Canada. Many travellers prefer to use [[Kampgrounds of America|KOA]], or similar campsites, as an alternative to [[hotel]]s or [[motel]]s.

Both commercial and governmental campgrounds typically charge a nominal fee for the privilege of camping there, to cover expenses, and in the case of an independent campground, to make a profit. However, there are some in North America that do not charge a use fee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freecampsites.net|title=Freecampsites.net - Directory of free and nearly free RV camping locations.|accessdate=2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rely on sources such as donations and tax dollars. Staying the night in a [[big-box store]] parking lot is also common (called "[[Recreational Vehicle#dry camping|boondocking]]"), and some retailers welcome RVs to their parking lots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.walmart.com/frequently-asked-questions#Park_RV|title=Walmart Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=16 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some RV parks provide year-round spaces.

===Trailer parks===
Frequently confused with campsites, campgrounds and RV parks, trailer parks are made up of long term or semi-permanent residents occupying mobile homes, park trailers or RVs.

===Holiday park===
[[File:Caravan Park Beer South Devon - geograph.org.uk - 42771.jpg|thumb|A caravan park at [[Beer, Devon|Beer]], in [[South Devon]], [[England]]]]
The holiday park is a [[United Kingdom]] version of the North American trailer park. Created to allow coastal resorts to enable temporary and high-income accommodation to be easily created, under [[Development control in the United Kingdom|UK planning laws]], no residents are permanent, and the park must be wholly shut to all for at least two months each year. All of the [[mobile homes]] are either available for rent from the land owner, or pitches are leased on a long-term basis from the land owner and the lease's own mobile home placed on the pitch. Permanent sites owners lease includes the provision by the land owner of water, sewerage and general site and grounds maintenance. Some holiday parks includes a small campsite for those touring the area, where they can pay to pitch tents or site touring caravans and motorhomes. Touring campsites have full access to the Holiday parks facilities, including [[clothes washing]] and showering. Most holiday parks include a central entertainments block, which can include a shop, restaurants, and a multi-purpose theatre used for both stage and activity-based entertainment.

=== '''Types of holiday park accommodation in the [[United Kingdom]]''' ===
'''Caravan Holiday Homes'''

Holiday parks vary in size and type, as do the kinds of accommodation available within them. Caravans are a popular choice with holiday makers, and modern varieties come complete with features like double glazing and central heating, cookers, fridges, showers, hot/cold water supplies, electricity and gas mains input.  A standard caravan is a single unit, built to a maximum of 14 feet wide.

Other types of mobile home include Lodges and Park Homes which are more expensive than caravans and offer more luxurious features. Higher end Lodges can be built using some of the same methods as traditional bricks and mortar buildings and include familiar materials like plasterboard and tongue and groove walls for an end result that’s very similar to a standard house.  A standard lodge uses similar materials as a standard caravan such as wood, gypsum board and plywood where the main difference being the extra width.  Lodges and Parkhomes can come in sizes up to 22 feet wide and 45 feet long, making them a popular choice with big families and large groups.

Holiday homes can be rented on an ad-hoc basis or purchased – caravans can be purchased from around £30,000 while park homes and lodges can cost between £100,000 and £500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parklink.uk|title=Find and buy holiday homes, parks and holiday in the UK with Parklink|last=|first=|date=|website=Parklink|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Certificated &amp; Certified Locations===
Certificated &amp; Certified Locations are smaller privately owned caravan sites which have to be approved by the UK based Camping &amp; Caravanning Club and The Caravan Club (and other organisations).  These campsites are normally reserved exclusively for Club members. These smaller campsites are allowed to operate under The Public Health Act 1936 and The Caravan and Control of Development Act 1960.

==Backcountry camping==
[[File:Camping at Head of Fionn Loch - geograph.org.uk - 47709.jpg|thumb|Backcountry camping in Scotland]]
In the U.S., ''backcountry camping'' is common in large undeveloped protected areas. These areas can only be reached on foot, bicycle, canoe or on [[horseback]]. The camping areas are usually established campsites or "zones", which have a predetermined maximum number of persons that are allowed to stay in the section per night. Strict regulations are imposed regarding food storage and resource protection. Usually in organized parks or wilderness areas, backcountry campsites require a permit, which may be free, obtainable at visitor centers and ranger stations. '''Dispersed camping''' in other areas may not require a permit.

==History==

===United States===
As with camping, campgrounds predated the automobile.  When President Theodore Roosevelt addressed Congress in 1901, he called for the creation of free campgrounds on Federal lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roosevelt|first1=Theodore|title=Extracts from President Roosevelt's Message to the Congress|journal=Science|date=1901|volume=14|issue=363|jstor=1627679|doi=10.1126/science.14.363.907|pages=907–912}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Already four national parks—Yellowstone, Sequoia, Yosemite, and Mount Rainier—were established and by the time Congress formally established the National Park Service in 1916, America had a dozen national parks.

While a handful of campgrounds, both public and private, could be found at  tourist destinations, as late as 1936 it was still difficult to find places to stop along the route to these parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woodall|first1=R. A.|title=The Trailer Park of 1937:  Good Parks were Rare in 1936--This Year Promises Improvement|journal=Trailer Travel Magazine|date=April 1937|volume=2|issue=4|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Instead, it was common for motorists to pull off the road and set up camp on private property.  This practice not only reinforced the negative, nomadic image of RV travelers, it was a detriment to expanding the trailer market.  The Trailer Coach Manufacturers Association began to lobby states to establish sanitation standards and worked with civic and business leaders to establish additional campgrounds, emphasizing the economic benefits of a campground in their community.  The Denver Civic Association wrote that a campground was just as essential to a town as a railway station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dixon|first1=Karl Hale|title=On and Off the Trail with the Editor:  What Constitutes a Modern Trailer Park|journal=Trailer Travel Magazine|date=June 1937|volume=2|issue=6|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The trailer industry's efforts were effective.  The number of campgrounds in the Trailer Travel Magazine's directory of campgrounds doubled to 1,650 by the end of 1936 and promised to double again by the end of 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sweeney|first1=Al J.|title=Trailer Park Growth Now on a Huge Scale|journal=Trailer Travel Magazine|date=June 1937|volume=2|issue=6|pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campgrounds themselves also changed.  Martin Hogue wrote, “The first public campgrounds in the United States were nothing more than large, dedicated clearings, free of trees, within which to concentrate groups of tourists.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hogue|first1=Martin|title=A Short History of the Campsite|url=https://placesjournal.org/article/a-short-history-of-the-campsite/.|website=Places|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A plant pathologist named Emilio Meinecke, was commissioned to study the effect of motor tourism in the Redwoods in 1929.  Meinicke's recommendations explained that instead of allowing campers to park haphazardly within a park, the camper's impact on the environment could be minimized through campground roads forming a one-way loop leading to individual parking spurs next to each campsite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meinecke|first1=Emilio Pepe Michael|title=A Report upon the Effect of Excessive Tourist Travel on the California Redwood Parks|date=1929|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015007490827;view=1up;seq=3.|accessdate=18 April 2015|location=Sacramento}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Although he would later continue to write of the effect of campers on nature, submitting a memorandum to the National Forest Service in 1935 entitled “The Trailer Menace,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meinecke|first1=Emilio Pepe Michael|title=The Trailer Menance|date=April 1, 1935|url=http://www.foresthistory.org/ASPNET/policy/Recreation/TrailerMenace.pdf|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had established the basic design for campgrounds still used today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18113">The '''capitalist peace''', or '''capitalist peace theory''', posits that according to a given criterion for economic development ([[capitalism]]), developed economies have not engaged in war with each other, and rarely enter into low-level disputes. These theories have been proposed as an explanation for the [[democratic peace theory]] by accounting for both democracy and the peace among democratic nations. The exact nature of the causality depends upon both the proposed variable and the measure of the indicator for the concept used.

==History==
The philosophical roots of capitalist peace can be traced back to [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Norman Angell]], and [[Classical liberalism|classical economic theory]]. In his 1795 essay Perpetual Peace, Immanuel Kant argued, among other things, that "the spirit of commerce . . . sooner or later takes hold of every nation, and is incompatible with war."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. 1939 [1795]. Perpetual Peace. Translated and Edited by Nicholas Murray Butler. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early twentieth century Norman Angell reasoned that trade interdependence in modern economies makes war unprofitable.&lt;ref&gt;Angell, Norman. 1913 [1911]. The Great Illusion: A Study of the Relation of Military Power to National Advantage. G.P. Putnam's Sons: London.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Joseph Schumpeter offered the observation that with the advancement of capitalism people form "an unwarlike disposition."&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter, Joseph. 1955. Imperialism ; Social Classes : Two Essays. Translated by Heinz Norden. New York : Meridian Books. Pp. 66-68&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern capitalist peace emerged with the democratic peace. In one of the earliest systematic confirmations of the democratic peace,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart A. Bremer, "Dangerous Dyads: Conditions Affecting the Likelihood of Interstate War, 1816-1965," ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'', 36:309-41 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart Bremer also examined the relationship between capitalism and war. He found capitalism to be a more powerful force for peace than democracy, yet the democratic peace accrued much more attention in the academic and policy literature. Today at least four theories of capitalist peace can be identified, with some of these theories claiming that a capitalist peace may subsume the democratic one, given that capitalism may be the cause of both democracy and peace.

==Definitions==
A key to explaining the capitalist peace rests on the indicative measures for capitalism. There are at least four different definitions of capitalism currently being employed. {{Citation Needed|reason=There's just so many claims here without any citation at all|date=June 2018}}

===Capitalism&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;===
A number of models of the capitalist peace equate free markets with capitalism. In this usage, free markets and trade cause economic development, which in turn accounts for the peace among nations with advanced economies.

===Capitalism&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===
A second understanding of capitalism is one that is conceptualized based on the intensity of market contracting in a society, where a capitalist economy is defined as one where most actors in the economy are integrated by contracting in the market. By definition contracts must be voluntary and undertaken without coercion.

===Capitalism&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;===
In the third measure for capitalism  inter-state trade is seen as an indicator for a developed, hence a capitalist economy. The level of trade interdependence, therefore, is the operationalized measure of this third type of capitalism.

===Capitalism&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;===
The final way that capitalism has been measured is with the size of government. States that have limited governments, hence large private sectors, are supposed to be capitalist economies. The size of government is used as an indicator for the level of capitalism a state has achieved.

==Explanations==
There are five primary theories that have attempted to explain the capitalist peace, each of which has used one of the above definitions of capitalism. Each theory has achieved varying levels of success and empirical corroboration, although they all rely on capitalism as the main explanatory variable for peace.

===Trade interdependence===
The interdependent trade explanation for the capitalist peace is built on the foundations of classical economic theory. This idea, which can be traced back to Kant, became the original theoretical explanation for the capitalist peace. In 1996, Erich Weede tied trade and free markets to development and peace, proposing that trade interdependence caused peace between nations.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Weede, Economic Development, Social Order, and World Politics. Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Weede followed this up with what he called the "capitalist peace".&lt;ref&gt;Erich Weede, Balance of Power, Globalization and the Capitalist Peace, Potsdam: Liberal Verlag (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the empirical findings of the link between trade and development have been drawn into question, as one study found that the proportion of GDP to foreign trade is only 0.08, measured by logged GDP per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/03050621003785074 | first = Michael | last = Mousseau | year = 2010 | title = Coming to Terms with the Capitalist Peace | url = | journal = International Interactions | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 185–192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic norms theory===
Economic norms theory links the economic conditions of [[clientelism]], which prevail in many lower income societies, and a contract-intensive economy, which prevails in many higher income societies, with divergent political interests and habits.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mousseau, "The Social Market Roots of Democratic Peace," ''International Security'', Vol. 33, No. 4 (Spring 2009), 52-86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mousseau, "Market Civilization and its Clash with Terror," ''International Security'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (Winter 2002-2003), 5-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic norms theory arose as an alternative explanation to the democratic peace, because it identified the causal relationship between democracy and peace as spurious. [[Michael Mousseau]] identified contract-intensive economies as a possible cause of both democracy and peace. The explanation is based on two aspects widely accepted in social science: (1) [[bounded rationality]]; and (2) divergent hierarchies between clientelism and contract-intensive economies. In contract-intensive societies, individuals have a loyalty towards the state that enforces the contracts between strangers. As a consequence, individuals in these societies expect that their states enforce contracts reliably and impartially, protect individual rights, and make efforts to enhance the general welfare. Moreover, with the assumption of bounded rationality, individuals routinely dependent on trusting strangers in contracts will develop the habits of trusting strangers and preferring universal rights, impartial law, and liberal democratic government. In contrast, individuals in contract-poor societies will develop the habits of abiding by the commands of group leaders, and distrusting those from out-groups.

According to economic norms theory, the people in contract-rich nations enjoy a permanent and positive peace. As long as their states accede to popular demands and remain reliably impartial, individuals in nations with contract intensive economies have an interest in everyone’s rights and material welfare, within and outside the nation. Consequently, contract-intensive nations not only avoid war with each other but engage in intense levels of mutual cooperation specifically aimed at promoting each other's material welfare. Leaders of nations with contract-poor economies, in contrast, pursue the interests of their dominant groups and have no interest in the security or welfare of members of out-groups, whether they are internal or external to the nation.

===Free capital markets/capital openness===
This theory, originally introduced by [[EriK Gartzke]], [[Quan Li (academic)|Quan Li]], and [[Charles Boehmer]],  argues that nations with a high level of capital openness are able to avoid conflict with each other and maintain a lasting peace. In particular, nations with freer capital markets are more dependent on international investors, because the investors are likely to withdraw if the country is engaged in a war or inter-state conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke, "The Capitalist Peace," ''American Journal of Political Science'', 51:166-191 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke and J. Joseph Hewitt, "International Crises and the Capitalist Peace," ''International Interactions'', 2010 (forthcoming)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, leaders of states give greater credibility to threats made by countries with higher levels of capital openness, causing the aforementioned countries to be more peaceful than others by avoiding the possibility of misrepresentation of information. One particular advantage of this theory is that it has been formalized, which helps ensure its internal consistency. The 2007 study performed by Gartzke claimed to make the democratic peace variable insignificant when capital openness was controlled for, but a later re-examination found this study to have several design errors.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Dafoe, "Democracy Still Matters: The Risks of Sample Censoring and Cross-Sectional and Temporal Controls," (2009). Available at www.allandafoe.com/research.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Using measured logged GDP per capita, development correlates with openness to foreign capital at 0.14, slightly higher than trade.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke, et al., "Investing in the Peace: Economic Interdependence and International Conflict," ''International Organization'', 55:391-438 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the most recent study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/03050621003784846 | author = Erik Gartzke and J. Joseph Hewitt | year = 2010 | title = International Crises and the Capitalist Peace | url = | journal = International Interactions | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 115–145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; failed to control for the variables of economic norms theory and the size of government explanation.

===Size of government===
The size of government explanation for the capitalist peace relies on the fourth definition of capitalism.  Introduced by [[Patrick J. McDonald]],&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. McDonald, "The Purse Strings of Peace," ''American Journal of Political Science'', 51:569-582 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/03050621003784911 | author = Patrick J. McDonald | year = 2010 | title = Capitalism, Commitment, and Peace | url = | journal = International Interactions | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 146–168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea is that smaller governments are more dependent than larger or socialist governments on raising taxes for fighting wars. This makes the commitments of nations with smaller governments more credible than those with larger ones, allowing for nations with smaller governments, and thus "capitalist" economies, to be better positioned for avoiding conflicts.

===Ruling others by force===
This theory, adduces that if men want to oppose war, it is [[statism]] that they must oppose. So long as they hold the tribal notion that the individual is sacrificial fodder for the collective, that some men have the right to rule others by force, and that some (any) alleged "good" can justify it—there can be no peace within a nation and no peace among nations.&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand (1966). "The Roots of War," [[Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]].&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
==Golden arches theory==

In [[Thomas L. Friedman]]'s 1999 book ''[[The Lexus and the Olive Tree]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas. (2000) ''The Lexus and the Olive Tree''. New York: Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt; the following observation was presented: "No two countries that both had McDonald's had fought a war against each other since each got its McDonald's". He supported that observation, as a theory, by stating that when a country has reached an [[economic development]] where it has a [[middle class]] strong enough to support a McDonald's network, it would become a "McDonald's country", and will not be interested in fighting wars anymore.

Shortly after the book was published, [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO bombed Yugoslavia]]. On the first day of the bombing, McDonald's restaurants in [[Belgrade]] were demolished by angry protesters and were rebuilt only after the bombing ended. In the 2000 edition of the book, Friedman argued that this exception proved the rule: the war ended quickly, he argued, partly because the Serbian population did not want to lose their place in a global system "symbolised by McDonald's" (Friedman 2000: 252&amp;ndash;253).

Critics have pointed to two other conflicts fought before 2000 as counterexamples, depending on what one considers "a war":

* The 1989 [[United States invasion of Panama]]
* In 1999, India and Pakistan fought a war over [[Kashmir]], known as the [[Kargil War]]. Both countries had (and continue to have) McDonald's restaurants. Although the war was not fought in all possible theatres (such as Rajasthan and Punjab borders), both countries mobilised their military all along their common borders and both countries made threats involving their nuclear capabilities.

In 2005, Friedman said that he framed this theory in terms of McDonald's [[Golden Arches]] "with [[tongue in cheek|tongue slightly in cheek]]".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas. (2005) [[The Guardian]], 21 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2005 book ''[[The World is Flat]]'' he offered an updated theory he labelled the [[Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention]].

Since 2005, there have been three more conflicts cited as counterexamples:

* The 2006 war between [[Israel]] and [[Lebanon]], following hostilities ongoing since 1973, with [[South Lebanon]] occupied until May 2000. (McDonald's franchises were established in Israel and Lebanon in 1993 and 1998, respectively.) However, the [[Lebanese Armed Forces]] were not a party to the fighting, the Israel Defense Forces action being taken instead against the paramilitary group [[Hezbollah]].
* The [[2008 South Ossetia war]] between [[Russia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Both countries had McDonald's at the time (restaurants began in the two countries in 1990 and 1999, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2008/08/russia-georgia-and-ir-theory-part-i.html Russia, Georgia, and IR Theory: Part 1], ''Lawyers, Guns, and Money'' (featuring photos of McDonald's in both countries)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[2014 Crimean crisis]] between Russia and [[Ukraine]]. Both countries had McDonald's at the time.

Friedman's point is that due to [[globalization]], countries that have made strong economic ties with one another have too much to lose to ever go to war with one another. Regardless of whether the statement is true, the conclusions to be drawn are unclear. The global expansion of McDonald's restaurants is a relatively recent phenomenon when put into the context of the [[history of warfare]], and, with a few notable exceptions, has proceeded into relatively stable markets.

==Dell theory==

The '''Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention''', also known as simply the '''Dell Theory''', has been presented by [[Thomas Friedman]] in his book ''[[The World Is Flat]]''. This theory is an updated version of his previous "[[Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention]]".

:"The Dell Theory stipulates: No two countries that are both part of a major global supply chain, like [[Dell]]’s, will ever fight a war against each other as long as they are both part of the same global supply chain."&lt;ref name="Friedman, 421"&gt;''The World is Flat'' ({{ISBN|1-59397-668-2}}), Thomas L. Friedman, pg 421&lt;/ref&gt;

That is, as long as corporations have major [[supply chain]] operations in countries other than that corporation's home country, those countries will never engage in armed conflicts.  This is due to the economic interdependence between nations that arises from a large corporation (such as [[Dell]]) having supply chain operations in multiple global locations and the reluctance of developing nations (in which supply chain operations commonly take place) to give up their newfound wealth.

In his previous book ''[[The Lexus and the Olive Tree]]'', Friedman argued that no two nations with a [[McDonald's]] franchise had ever gone to war with one another: this was known as the [[Golden Arches theory]].  Later, Friedman upgraded that theory into the "Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention" by saying that people or nations don't just want to have a better standard of living as symbolized by McDonald's franchise in their downtown, but want to have the lump of the labour sector that is created by [[globalization]]. That is, developing nations do not want to risk the trust of the multi-national companies who venture into their markets and include them in the global supply chain.

[[Thomas Friedman]] also warns in his book ''[[The World Is Flat]]'' that the Dell Theory should not be interpreted as a guarantee that nations who are deeply involved in global supply chains will not go to war with each other. It rather means that the governments of these nations and their citizens will have very heavy economic costs to consider as they contemplate the possibility of war. These costs include the long-term loss of the country's profitable participation in the global supply chain.

This theory relates with how conflict prevention occurred between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in their [[2001–2002 India–Pakistan standoff|2001 - 2002 nuclear standoff]], where India was at risk of losing its global partners. The relationship between the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] was also cited as an example of this theory - they both have strong supply relations with each other and a war between the two seems very unlikely today.

Its director is {{ill|Jozef De Witte|nl}}.

The Centre was founded in 1993 by an Act of the [[Belgian Chamber of People's Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diversiteit.be/CNTR/EN/legislation/Centre/leg_cntr_act93.htm |title=Act of February 15, 1993, pertaining to the foundation of a centre for equal opportunities and opposition to racism |accessdate=23 October 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012233422/http://www.diversiteit.be/CNTR/EN/legislation/Centre/leg_cntr_act93.htm |archivedate=2006-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tasks and goals==
The Centre lists as its principal tasks:
* ''Fighting Racism and Discrimination''
* ''Spotlight on Integration Policy''
* ''Foreigners' Rights and Recent Immigration''
* ''Fighting Poverty''
* ''Fighting Human Trafficking''
* ''Training / Documentation / Information Campaigns''

The CEOOR has as its main goal to aid victims of discrimination, after an act of discrimination has occurred, or to prevent such acts.

It has four ways of achieving this goal :
* ''Assisting discrimination victims. This can be done by giving (legal) advice or support, mediation or going to court.''
* ''Creating awareness among the public opinion for discrimination issues, by training, education, documentation and public relations.''
* ''Working with authorities and different actors in society on preventive anti-discrimination and integration policies.''
* ''Recommendations to policy makers on the different issues it addresses.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diversiteit.be/CNTR/EN/about_the_center/activities/ About the Centre - Activities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012211829/http://www.diversiteit.be/CNTR/EN/about_the_center/activities/ |date=October 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases==
The CEOOR was, together with the [[Human Rights League (Dutch-speaking Belgium)|Liga voor Mensenrechten (''Human Rights League'')]], a plaintiff in the law case that led to the conviction of three [[Vlaams Blok]] organisations for "incitement to hate and discrimination."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051028063026/http://jackosheas.com/news/newsstory.cfm?story_no=1124 Court says Vlaams Blok conviction is sound], Expatriate Online, 10 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3994867.stm Court rules Vlaams Blok is racist], BBC News, 9 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2002 the Centre lodged a complaint against the [[Centre Islamique et Culturel de Belgique]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centreislamique.be/|title=Centre Islamique et Culturel de Belgique|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of a video on its website in which Israel was equated with a Nazi dictatorship. In June 2002, the CEOOR lodged another complaint against the Belgian [[Arab European League]], also for racism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2001-2/belgium.htm Annual report %gt; Belgium] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123134145/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2001-2/belgium.htm |date=November 23, 2005 }}, The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary  Antisemitism and Racism, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July 2004, the Centre together with the Dutch-speaking Human Rights League in Belgium received the country's annual "Democracy Award". It is given to persons or organisations that "protect or enhance political democracy or facilitate the participation of citizens in society".&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.nieuwsblad.be/Article/Detail.aspx?articleID=ggs72a1j Prijs voor democratie naar Liga voor Mensenrechten en Centrum Gelijke Kansen] ("''Democracy Award to Human Rights League and Centre Equal Opportunities''"), Het Nieuwsblad, 1 July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The jury from the organisations, ''Trefpunt'' and the [[Anti-globalization|anti-globalist]] ''Democratie 2000'', awarded this prize to the Centre and Liga for their role in the condemnation of the [[Vlaams Blok]] in a case before the [[Ghent]] Court of Appeals.&lt;ref&gt;Prijs voor de democratie uitgereikt ("''Prize for the Democracy Awarded''"), ''[[De Tijd]]'', 1 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, the Centre came under scrutiny and received protests from Parliamentarians after that it was confronted with anti-Judaic texts published on their website regarding stoning of women. The Centre removed thereafter the racist texts from their site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vitelu.be/?p=802|title=Vitelu.be|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financials ==
The 2005 financial report of the Centre showed that of its total revenue of €6.2 million, €4.4 million came from the {{ill|Belgian National Lottery|nl|Nationale Loterij van België}} and €1.0 million from the Centre's projects. Expenditure for personnel were €4.0 million. The Centre posted a net result of €705,000 in 2005. The balance at the end of the year 2005 showed, that the Centre's equity was €4.94 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diversiteit.be/CNTR/EN/about_the_center/balance/ Financial report 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012211457/http://www.diversiteit.be/CNTR/EN/about_the_center/balance/ |date=October 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diversiteit.be/NR/rdonlyres/3026A1C6-7584-4007-8AB9-1AEDF2783AEC/0/05_jaarverslagcentrum.pdf Jaarverslag 2005]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the end of the [[Second World War]] to the beginning of the [[McCarthy era]] (1945–1950), the American professional theatre produced twenty shows on civil rights, nine of them on Broadway. 

Off-Broadway and out of town shows displayed a wider array of moral stances, ranging from gentle persuasion of ''Florence'' (1949) by [[Alice Childress]] and the religious fervor of ''[[Trial by Fire (play)|Trial by Fire]]'' (1947) by [[George Dunne (priest)|George Dunne]] to the activism of ''Earth and Stars'' (1946) by [[Randolph Edmonds]].

While musicals dominated commercial theatre in the 1940s, four dramas about the African Americans addressed the nations racial dilemma. The first, [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]'s, ''[[Native Son (play)|Native Son]]'' (1941), opened at the St. James Theatre on Broadway on 24 March 1941. Wright's novel had firmly laid the responsibility for Bigger’s brutality on the doorstep of white America, but in adapting the novel to the stage, [[Paul Green (playwright)|Paul Green]], a southern folk dramatist, had insisted that Bigger take some responsibility for the murders he had committed.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Errol, and James Vernon Hatch. A History of African American Theatre. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Houseman]] and [[Orson Welles]] preferred Wright’s original concepts and discarded the modifications made by Green, which had softened Bigger’s character. When Green saw the play he was angered and later published his own version. [[Canada Lee]] created the role of Bigger Thomas, receiving near unanimous praise from the critics. The production ran for 114 straight performances before touring major US cities and returning to New York to run for an additional eighty-four performances before closing, in part because of America’s declared war on 7 December 1941, which had refocused the nation’s attention. 

The second civil rights drama, ''Strange Fruit'' (1945), set in a small Georgia town, had been adapted from Lilian Smith’s controversial novel. Staged by José Ferrer, the play featured 23-year-old [[Jane White]] as Nonnie, a black girl made pregnant by a white boy played by [[Mel Ferrer]]. Other Blacks in the cast were [[Juano Hernandez]], Edna Thomas, [[Alonzo Bosan]], [[Ken Renard]], and [[Dorothy Carter]]. [[Robert Earl Jones]] played the lynch victim. The play lasted for sixty performances, in part because [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] wrote enthusiastically about it in her syndicated column, “My Day.” 

After the Allies defeated Germany and Japan in 1945, black soldiers returned home to segregated housing. On Whitman Avenue (1946), a civil rights drama on discrimination in the renting and sale of housing, starred Canada Lee, this time playing a decorated war hero trying to move his family into a white neighborhood. [[Abbie Mitchell]], [[Augustus Smith (actor)|Augustus Smith]], and [[Peter Morell]] played the members of Lee’s family. [[Margo Jones]], from Dallas, Texas, directed the drama, which was written by [[Maxine Wood]]. In response to unenthusiastic reviews, Eleanor Roosevelt observed in her weekly column that the American people were in a period of retrogression and did not want to be reminded of their shortcomings. With Roosevelt’s help and that of [[Langston Hughes]], the play remained alive for 148 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Errol, and James Vernon Hatch. A History of African American Theatre.

[[File:Europe 1815 map en.png|thumb|upright=2.05|The national boundaries within Europe set by the Congress of Vienna]]
The '''Congress of Vienna''' ({{lang-de|Wiener Kongress}}) also called '''Vienna Congress''', was a meeting of ambassadors of European states chaired by [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] statesman [[Klemens von Metternich]], and held in [[Vienna]] from November 1814 to June 1815, though the delegates had arrived and were already negotiating by late September 1814. The objective of the Congress was to provide a long-term peace plan for Europe by settling critical issues arising from the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The goal was not simply to restore old boundaries but to resize the main powers so they could balance each other and remain at peace.  The leaders were [[conservatism|conservatives]] with little use for [[republicanism]] or [[revolution]], both of which threatened to upset the [[status quo]] in Europe. France lost all its recent conquests while [[Prussia]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] made major territorial gains. Prussia added smaller German states in the west, [[Swedish Pomerania]] and 60% of the [[Kingdom of Saxony]]; Austria gained [[Venice]] and much of northern Italy. Russia gained [[Duchy of Warsaw|parts of Poland]]. The new [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] had been created just months before, and included formerly Austrian territory that in 1830 became [[Belgium]].

[[File:Berlin .Gendarmenmarkt .Deutscher Dom 010.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Frontispiece of the Acts of the Congress of Vienna]]
The immediate background was [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France's]] defeat and [[treaty of Paris (1814)|surrender in May 1814]], which brought an end to 25 years of nearly continuous war. Negotiations continued despite the outbreak of fighting triggered by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] dramatic return from exile and resumption of power in France during the [[Hundred Days]] of March to July 1815. The Congress's "final act" was signed nine days before his final defeat at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] on 18 June 1815.

The Congress has often been criticized for causing the subsequent suppression of the emerging national and liberal movements,&lt;ref name="Olson-Shadle"/&gt; and it has been seen as a reactionary movement for the benefit of traditional monarchs. However, others praise it for having created relatively long-term stability and peaceful conditions in most of Europe.&lt;ref name=Jarrett/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schroeder/&gt;

In a technical sense, the "Congress of Vienna" was not properly a congress: it never met in [[plenary session]], and most of the discussions occurred in informal, face-to-face sessions among the [[Great power|Great Powers]] of Austria, Britain, France, Russia, and sometimes Prussia, with limited or no participation by other delegates. On the other hand, the congress was the first occasion in history where, on a continental scale, national representatives came together to formulate treaties instead of relying mostly on messages among the several capitals. The Congress of Vienna settlement, despite later changes, formed the framework for European international politics until the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1914.

==Preliminaries==
The [[Treaty of Chaumont]] in 1814 had reaffirmed decisions that had been made already and that would be ratified by the more important Congress of Vienna of 1814-15. They included the establishment of a confederated Germany, the division of Italy into independent states, the restoration of the Bourbon kings of Spain, and the enlargement of the Netherlands to include what in 1830 became modern Belgium. The Treaty of Chaumont became the cornerstone of the European Alliance that formed the balance of power for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick B. Artz, ''Reaction &amp; Revolution: 1814–1832'' (1934) p 110&lt;/ref&gt; Other partial settlements had already occurred at the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] between France and the [[Sixth Coalition]], and the [[Treaty of Kiel]] that covered issues raised regarding [[Scandinavia]]. The Treaty of Paris had determined that a "general congress" should be held in [[Vienna]] and that invitations would be issued to "all the Powers engaged on either side in the present war".&lt;ref&gt;Article XXXII. See Harold Nicolson, ''The Congress of Vienna'', chap. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The opening was scheduled for July 1814.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=David|title=Vienna 1814: How the Conquerors of Napoleon Made Love, War, and Peace at the Congress of Vienna|publisher=Crown Publishing Group|year=2008|isbn=978-0-307-33716-0|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Congress functioned through formal meetings such as working groups and official diplomatic functions; however, a large portion of the Congress was conducted informally at salons, banquets, and balls.

===Four Great Powers and Bourbon France===
The Four Great Powers had previously formed the core of the [[Sixth Coalition]]. On the verge of Napoleon's defeat they had outlined their common position in the [[Treaty of Chaumont]] (March 1814), and negotiated the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)]] with the [[Bourbon dynasty|Bourbons]] during [[Bourbon Restoration|their restoration]]:
* [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] was represented by [[Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Prince Metternich]], the Foreign Minister, and by his deputy, [[Baron Johann von Wessenberg-Ampringen|Baron Johann von Wessenberg]]. As the Congress's sessions were in Vienna, Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis]] was kept closely informed.
* Britain was represented first by its [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Viscount Castlereagh]]; then by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], after Castlereagh's return to England in February 1815. In the last weeks it was headed by the [[Richard Le Poer Trench, 2nd Earl of Clancarty|Earl of Clancarty]], after Wellington left to face Napoleon during the [[Hundred Days]].
* Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] controlled the Russian delegation which was formally led by the foreign minister, Count [[Karl Robert Nesselrode]]. The tsar had two main goals, to gain control of Poland and to promote the peaceful coexistence of European nations. He succeeded in forming the [[Holy Alliance]] (1815), based on monarchism and anti-secularism, and formed to combat any threat of revolution or republicanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Harold|title=The Congress of Vienna; a Study in Allied Unity, 1812–1822|publisher=Constable &amp; co. ltd.|year=1946|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prussia was represented by Prince [[Karl August von Hardenberg]], the Chancellor, and the diplomat and scholar [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] was also in Vienna, playing his role behind the scenes.
* [[Bourbon Restoration|France]], the "fifth" power, was represented by its foreign minister, [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]], as well as the Minister Plenipotentiary the Duke of Dalberg. Talleyrand had already negotiated the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)]] for [[Louis XVIII of France]]; the king, however, distrusted him and was also secretly negotiating with Metternich, by mail.&lt;ref name=Malettke66&gt;{{cite book|last=Malettke|first=Klaus|title=Die Bourbonen 3.

Virtually every state in Europe had a delegation in Vienna – more than 200 states and princely houses were represented at the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Page 2 of King (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there were representatives of cities, corporations, religious organizations (for instance, abbeys) and special interest groups – e.g., a delegation representing German publishers, demanding a copyright law and freedom of the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zamoyski|first=Adam|title=Rites of Peace; the Fall of Napoleon and the Congress of Vienna|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|year=2007|pages=258, 295|isbn=978-0-06-077518-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Congress was noted for its lavish entertainment: according to a famous joke it did not move, but danced.&lt;ref&gt;According to King (2008), it was Prince de Ligne, an attendee at the conference, who wryly quipped, “the congress does not move forward, it dances.” ("Le congrès danse beaucoup, mais il ne marche pas.")&lt;/ref&gt;

==Talleyrand's role==
[[File:Talleyrand 02.jpg|thumb|alt=oil painting of Tallyrand, the French ambassador|[[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]] proved an able negotiator for the defeated French.]]

Initially, the representatives of the four victorious powers hoped to exclude the French from serious participation in the negotiations, but Talleyrand skillfully managed to insert himself into "her inner councils" in the first weeks of negotiations. He allied himself to a Committee of Eight lesser powers (including Spain, Sweden, and Portugal) to control the negotiations. Once Talleyrand was able to use this committee to make himself a part of the inner negotiations, he then left it,&lt;ref&gt;William, Sir Ward Adolphus (2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=cTxvfSPXz7sC&amp;pg=RA1-PA13&amp;dq=Talleyrand+left+Committee+of+Eight&amp;hl=cs&amp;ei=dwaaTIzfIovNjAf9upQ0&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Talleyrand%20left%20Committee%20of%20Eight&amp;f=false ''The Period of Congresses''], BiblioLife, p. 13. {{ISBN|1-113-44924-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; once again abandoning his allies.

The major Allies' indecision on how to conduct their affairs without provoking a united protest from the lesser powers led to the calling of a preliminary conference on protocol, to which Talleyrand and the [[Pedro Gómez Labrador, Marquis of Labrador|Marquis of Labrador]], Spain's representative, were invited on 30 September 1814.&lt;ref name="Nicolson"&gt;Nicolson, Sir Harold (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTC3IWC_py8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=congress+of+vienna&amp;hl=cs&amp;ei=5deZTM7GGI7KjAfCpsAO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Talleyrand%2030%20september&amp;f=false ''The Congress of Vienna: A Study in Allied Unity: 1812–1822''] Grove Press; Rep. Ed. pp. 140–164. {{ISBN|0-8021-3744-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress Secretary [[Friedrich von Gentz]] reported, "The intervention of Talleyrand and Labrador has hopelessly upset all our plans. Talleyrand protested against the procedure we have adopted and soundly [be]rated us for two hours. It was a scene I shall never forget."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Mary Alsop|title=The Congress Dances|location=New York|publisher=Harper &amp; Row, Publishers|year=1984|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The embarrassed representatives of the Allies replied that the document concerning the protocol they had arranged actually meant nothing. "If it means so little, why did you sign it?" snapped Labrador.

Talleyrand's policy, directed as much by national as personal ambitions, demanded the close but by no means amicable relationship he had with Labrador, whom Talleyrand regarded with disdain.&lt;ref&gt;Wenceslao Ramírez de Villa-Urrutia, Marqués de Villa-Urrutia, ''España en el Congreso de Viena según la correspondencia de D. Pedro Gómez Labrador, Marqués de Labrador''. Segunda Edición Corregida y Aumentada (Madrid: Francisco Beltrán, 1928), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Labrador later remarked of Talleyrand: "that cripple, unfortunately, is going to Vienna."&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Rodríguez-Moñino (ed.), ''Cartas Políticas'' (Badajoz: Imprenta Provincial, 1959), 14 (Letter IV, 10 July 1814). Labrador's letters are full of such pungent remarks, and include his opinions on bad diplomats, the state of the postal system, the weather, and his non-existent salary and coach and accompanying livery for the Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; Talleyrand skirted additional articles suggested by Labrador: he had no intention of handing over the 12,000 ''afrancesados'' – Spanish fugitives, sympathetic to France, who had sworn fealty to [[Joseph Bonaparte]], nor the bulk of the documents, paintings, pieces of fine art, and books that had been looted from the archives, palaces, churches and cathedrals of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Villa-Urrutia, ''España en el Congreso de Viena'', 61–2. Joseph had left Madrid with a huge baggage train containing pieces of art, tapestries, and mirrors. The most rapacious of the French was Marshal [[Nicolas Soult]], who left Spain with entire collections, which disappeared to unknown, separate locations around the world. According to Juan Antonio Gaya Nuño, at least "[the paintings] have come to spread the prestige of Spanish art around the whole word."&lt;/ref&gt;
===Polish-Saxon crisis===&lt;!-- the redirect Polish-Saxon crisis redirects to this section heading--&gt;
The most dangerous topic at the Congress was the so-called Polish-Saxon Crisis. Russia wanted most of Poland, and Prussia wanted all of Saxony, whose king had allied with Napoleon. The tsar would become king of Poland.&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Zawadzki, "Russia and the Re-Opening of the Polish Question, 1801-1814," ''International History Review'' (1985) 7#1 pp 19-44.&lt;/ref&gt;  Austria was fearful this would make Russia much too powerful, a view which was supported by Britain. The result was deadlock, for which Talleyrand proposed a solution: Admit France to the inner circle, and France would support Austria and Britain. The three nations signed a secret treaty on 3 January 1815, agreeing to go to war against Russia and Prussia, if necessary, to prevent the Russo-Prussian plan from coming to fruition.&lt;ref name="Nicolson"/&gt;

When the tsar heard of the secret treaty he agreed to a compromise that satisfied all parties on 24 October 1815. Russia received most of the Napoleonic [[Duchy of Warsaw]] as a "Kingdom of Poland" – called [[Congress Poland]], with the tsar as king ruling it independently of Russia. Russia, however, did not receive the [[province of Posen]] (Poznań), which was given to Prussia as the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]], nor [[Kraków]], which became a [[Free City of Kraków|free city]].  Furthermore, the tsar was unable to unite the new domain with the parts of Poland that had been incorporated into Russia in the 1790s.  Prussia received 60 percent of Saxony-later known as the [[Province of Saxony]], with the remainder returned to King [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony|Frederick Augustus I]] as his [[Kingdom of Saxony]].

[[File:Gains territoriaux de la France en 1814.svg|thumb|In pink, territories left to France in 1814 but removed after the [[Hundred Days]].]]
The Final Act, embodying all the separate treaties, was signed on 9 June 1815 (a few days before the [[Battle of Waterloo]]). Its provisions included:
* Russia was given most of the Duchy of Warsaw (Poland) and was allowed to keep [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]] (which it had annexed from Sweden in 1809 and held until 1917).
* Prussia was given three fifths of [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]], parts of the Duchy of Warsaw (the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]]), [[Danzig]], and the [[Rhineland]]/[[Westphalia]].
* A [[German Confederation]] of 39 states was created from the previous 300 of the Holy Roman Empire, under the presidency of the Austrian Emperor. Only portions of the territory of Austria and Prussia were included in the Confederation.
* The Netherlands and the [[Southern Netherlands]] (approx. modern-day Belgium) were united in a monarchy, the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], with the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] providing the king (the [[Eight Articles of London]]).
* To compensate for the Orange-Nassau's loss of the Nassau lands to Prussia, the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] were to form a [[personal union]] under the House of Orange-Nassau, with Luxembourg (but not the Netherlands) inside the [[German Confederation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Couvée|first=D.H.|author2=G. Pikkemaat|title=1813–15, ons koninkrijk geboren|publisher=N. Samsom nv|year=1963|location=Alphen aan den Rijn|pages=127–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Swedish Pomerania]], given to Denmark a year earlier in return for [[Norway]], was ceded by Denmark to Prussia. [[France]] received back [[Guadeloupe]] from Sweden in return for [[Guadeloupe Fund|yearly installments]] to the Swedish king.
* The neutrality of [[Switzerland]] was guaranteed.
* [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]] gave up the [[Duchy of Lauenburg]] to Denmark, but was enlarged by the addition of former territories of the [[Bishop of Münster]] and by the formerly Prussian [[East Frisia]], and made a kingdom.
* Most of the territorial gains of [[Bavaria]], [[Württemberg]], [[Baden]], [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Darmstadt]], and [[Duchy of Nassau|Nassau]] under the [[German mediatization|mediatizations]] of 1801–1806 were recognized. Bavaria also gained control of the [[Palatinate region|Rhenish Palatinate]] and parts of the Napoleonic [[Duchy of Würzburg]] and [[Grand Duchy of Frankfurt]]. Hesse-Darmstadt, in exchange for giving up the Duchy of Westphalia to Prussia, received [[Rhenish Hesse]] with its capital at [[Mainz]].
* Austria regained control of the [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] and [[Salzburg]]; of the former [[Illyrian Provinces]]; of [[Tarnopol]] district (from Russia); received [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia|Lombardy-Venetia]] in Italy and [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]] in [[Dalmatia]]. Former Austrian territory in Southwest Germany remained under the control of Württemberg and Baden, and the [[Southern Netherlands|Austrian Netherlands]] were also not recovered.
* Habsburg princes were returned to control of the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] and the [[Duchy of Modena]].
* The [[Papal States]] were under the rule of the pope and restored to their former extent, with the exception of [[Avignon]] and the [[Comtat Venaissin]], which remained part of France.
* Britain was confirmed in control of the [[Cape Colony]] in Southern Africa; [[Tobago]]; [[Ceylon]]; and various other colonies in Africa and Asia. Other colonies, most notably the [[Dutch East Indies]] and [[Martinique]], were restored to their previous owners.
* The King of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]] was restored in [[Piedmont]], Nice, and [[Savoy]], and was given control of [[Genoa]] (putting an end to the brief proclamation of a restored [[Republic of Genoa|Republic]]).
* The [[Duchy of Parma|Duchies of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla]] were given to [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie Louise]], Napoleon's wife.
* The [[Duchy of Lucca]] was created for the [[House of Bourbon-Parma]], which would have reversionary rights to Parma after the death of [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie Louise]].
* The Bourbon [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand IV]], King of Sicily was restored to control of the [[Kingdom of Naples]] after [[Joachim Murat]], the king installed by Bonaparte, supported Napoleon in the [[Hundred Days]] and started the [[Neapolitan War]] by attacking Austria.
* The [[slave trade]] was condemned.
* Freedom of navigation was guaranteed for many rivers, notably [[Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine|the Rhine]] and the Danube.

The Final Act was signed by representatives of Austria, France, [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], Prussia, Russia, [[Union between Sweden and Norway|Sweden-Norway]], and Britain. Spain did not sign the treaty but ratified it in 1817.

[[File:Alexander I of Russia by F.Kruger (1837, Hermitage).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=The Tsar mounted on his horse|[[Alexander I of Russia]] (1812) considered himself a guarantor of European security. ]]The Congress's principal results, apart from its confirmation of France's loss of the territories annexed between 1795–1810, which had already been settled by the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]], were the enlargement of Russia, (which gained most of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]]) and Prussia, which acquired the district of Poznań, Swedish Pomerania, Westphalia and the northern Rhineland. The consolidation of Germany from the nearly 300 states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (dissolved in 1806) into a much less complex system of thirty-nine states (4 of which were free cities) was confirmed. These states formed a loose [[German Confederation]] under the leadership of Austria and Prussia.

Representatives at the Congress agreed to numerous other territorial changes. By the [[Treaty of Kiel]], Norway had been ceded by the king of [[Denmark-Norway]] to the king of [[Sweden]]. This sparked the nationalist movement which led to the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Norway (1814)|Kingdom of Norway]] on [[Norway in 1814|May 17, 1814]] and the subsequent personal [[Union between Sweden and Norway|Union]] with [[Sweden]]. Austria gained [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia|Lombardy-Venetia]] in Northern Italy, while much of the rest of North-Central Italy went to Habsburg dynasties (the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], the [[Duchy of Modena]], and the [[Duchy of Parma]]).&lt;ref name="Stearns-Langer"&gt;Stearns, Peter N. – Langer, William Leonard (2001).

The [[Papal States]] were restored to the Pope. The Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia was restored to its mainland possessions, and also gained control of the Republic of [[Genoa]]. In Southern Italy, Napoleon's brother-in-law, [[Joachim Murat]], was originally allowed to retain his [[Kingdom of Naples]], but his support of Napoleon in the [[Hundred Days]] led to the restoration of the Bourbon [[Ferdinand IV of Naples|Ferdinand IV]] to the throne.&lt;ref name="Stearns-Langer"/&gt;

A large [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was formed for the [[Prince of Orange]], including both the old [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] and the formerly Austrian-ruled territories in the Southern Netherlands. Other, less important, territorial adjustments included significant territorial gains for the German Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]] (which gained [[East Frisia]] from Prussia and various other territories in Northwest Germany) and [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] (which gained the [[Palatinate region|Rhenish Palatinate]] and territories in [[Franconia]]). The [[Duchy of Lauenburg]] was transferred from Hanover to Denmark, and Prussia annexed [[Swedish Pomerania]]. [[Switzerland]] was enlarged, and Swiss neutrality was established. Swiss mercenaries had played a significant role in European wars for a couple of hundred years: the Congress intended to put a stop to these activities permanently.

During the wars, [[Portugal]] had lost its town of [[Olivenza|Olivença]] to Spain and moved to have it restored. Portugal is historically Britain's oldest ally, and with British support succeeded in having the re-incorporation of [[Olivenza|Olivença]] decreed in Article 105 of the Final Act, which stated that the Congress "understood the occupation of Olivença to be illegal and recognized Portugal's rights". Portugal ratified the Final Act in 1815 but Spain would not sign, and this became the most important hold-out against the Congress of Vienna. Deciding in the end that it was better to become part of Europe than to stand alone, Spain finally accepted the Treaty on 7 May 1817; however, [[Olivenza|Olivença]] and its surroundings were never returned to Portuguese control and this question remains unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, Richard James (1966).

Under the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]], Britain obtained a protectorate over the [[United States of the Ionian Islands]] and the [[Seychelles]].

==Later criticism==
The Congress of Vienna has frequently been criticized by 19th century and more recent historians for ignoring national and liberal impulses, and for imposing a stifling [[reactionary|reaction]] on the Continent.&lt;ref name="Olson-Shadle"&gt;Olson, James Stuart – Shadle, Robert (1991). [https://books.google.com/books?id=uyqepNdgUWkC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=congress+of+vienna+criticised+by+historians&amp;hl=cs&amp;ei=U-qZTLzpCJG7jAf5joHwDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Historical dictionary of European imperialism''], Greenwood Press, p. 149. {{ISBN|0-313-26257-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an integral part in what became known as the [[Conservative Order]], in which the liberties and civil rights associated with the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution]]s were de-emphasized, so that a fair balance of power, peace and stability, might be achieved.&lt;ref name="Olson-Shadle"/&gt;

In the 20th century, however, many historians came to admire the statesmen at the Congress, whose work prevented another widespread European war for nearly 100 years (1815–1914). Among these is [[Henry Kissinger]], who in 1954 wrote his [[doctoral dissertation]], ''[[A World Restored]]'', on it. Historian Mark Jarrett argues that the Congress of Vienna and the Congress System marked "the true beginning of our modern era". He says the Congress System was deliberate conflict management, and was the first genuine attempt to create an international order based upon consensus rather than conflict. "Europe was ready," Jarrett states, "to accept an unprecedented degree of international cooperation in response to the French Revolution."&lt;ref name=Jarrett&gt;Mark Jarrett, ''The Congress of Vienna and Its Legacy: War and Great Power Diplomacy after Napoleon'' (2013) pp. 353, xiv, 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Paul Schroeder argues that the old formulae for "[[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]]" were in fact highly destabilizing and predatory. He says the Congress of Vienna avoided them and instead set up rules that produced a stable and benign equilibrium.&lt;ref name=Schroeder&gt;Paul W. Schroeder, "Did the Vienna settlement rest on a balance of power?" ''American Historical Review'' (1992) 97#3 pp 683-706. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2164774 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The Congress of Vienna was the first of a series of international meetings that came to be known as the [[Concert of Europe]], which was an attempt to forge a peaceful [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] in Europe. It served as a model for later organizations such as the [[League of Nations]] in 1919 and the [[United Nations]] in 1945.

Before the opening of the Paris peace conference of 1918, the British Foreign Office commissioned a history of the Congress of Vienna to serve as an example to its own delegates of how to achieve an equally successful peace.&lt;ref&gt;Ragsdale, Hugh – Ponomarev, V. N. (1993). [https://books.google.com/books?id=bwvllKkPQtYC&amp;pg=PA413&amp;dq=Paris+peace+1918+British+Foreign+Office+history+of+the+Congress+of+Vienna&amp;hl=cs&amp;ei=qfiZTLLMIY2OjAez3vgU&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Paris%20peace%201918%20British%20Foreign%20Office%20history%20of%20the%20Congress%20of%20Vienna&amp;f=false ''Imperial Russian foreign policy''], [[Cambridge University Press]]; 1st ed. {{ISBN|0-521-44229-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, the main decisions of the Congress were made by the Four Great Powers and not all the countries of Europe could extend their rights at the Congress. The Italian peninsula became a mere "geographical expression" as divided into seven parts: [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia|Lombardy–Venetia]], [[Duchy of Modena and Reggio|Modena]], [[Kingdom of Two Sicilies|Naples–Sicily]], [[Duchy of Parma|Parma]], [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont–Sardinia]], [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]], and the [[Papal States]] under the control of different powers.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, Bertram (2008).

Vol. I, p. 7, {{ISBN|0-554-41246-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poland]] remained partitioned between Russia, Prussia and Austria, with the largest part, the newly created [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], remaining under Russian control.

The arrangements made by the Four Great Powers sought to ensure future disputes would be settled in a manner that would avoid the terrible wars of the previous 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Willner, Mark – Hero, George – Weiner, Jerry Global (2006).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6894">'''Conventionalism''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] attitude that fundamental principles of a certain kind are grounded on (explicit or implicit) agreements in society, rather than on external reality. Although this attitude is commonly held with respect to the rules of [[grammar]], its application to the propositions of [[ethics]], law, [[science]], mathematics, and logic is more controversial. 

==Linguistics==
{{also|Cratylism|True name}}
The debate on linguistic conventionalism goes back to [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' and the [[Mīmāṃsā]] philosophy of [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}
It has been the standard position of modern [[linguistics]] since [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s ''[[l'arbitraire du signe]]'', but there have always been dissenting positions of [[phonosemantics]], recently defended by [[Margaret Magnus]] and [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

==Philosophy of mathematics==
{{also|Preintuitionism}}
The French [[mathematician]] [[Henri Poincaré]] was among the first to articulate a conventionalist view.  Poincaré's use of [[non-Euclidean geometries]] in his work on differential equations convinced him that [[Euclidean geometry]] should not be regarded as an ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' truth.  He held that [[axioms]] in geometry should be chosen for the results they produce, not for their apparent coherence with &amp;ndash;possibly flawed&amp;ndash; human intuitions about the physical world.

==Epistemology==
Conventionalism was adopted by [[logical positivism|logical positivists]], chiefly [[Alfred Jules Ayer|A. J. Ayer]] and [[Carl Hempel]], and extended to both mathematics and logic.  To deny [[rationalism]], Ayer sees two options for [[empiricism]] regarding the necessity of the truth of formal logic (and mathematics): 1) deny that they actually are necessary, and then account for why they only appear so, or 2) claim that the truths of logic and mathematics lack factual content - they are not "truths about the world" - and then explain how they are nevertheless true and informative.&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, Alfred Jules. ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'', Dover Publications, Inc.: New York. 1952. p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Stuart Mill]] adopted the former, which Ayer criticized, opting himself for the latter.  Ayer's argument relies primarily on the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic/synthetic distinction]].

The French [[philosopher]] [[Pierre Duhem]] espoused a broader conventionalist view encompassing all of science.  Duhem was skeptical that human perceptions are sufficient to understand the "true," metaphysical nature of reality and argued that scientific laws should be valued mainly for their predictive power and correspondence with observations.

[[Karl Popper]] broadened the meaning of conventionalism still more. In ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', he defined a "conventionalist stratagem" as any technique that is used by a theorist to evade the consequences of a falsifying observation or experiment. Popper identified four such stratagems: 

* introducing an ad hoc hypothesis which makes the refuting evidence seem irrelevant;
* modifying the [[ostensive definition]]s so as to alter the content of a theory;
* doubting the reliability of the experimenter; declaring that the observations that threaten the tested theory are irrelevant;
* casting doubt on the acumen of the theorist when she does not produce ideas that can save the theory.

Popper argued that it was crucial to avoid conventionalist stratagems if [[falsifiability]] of a theory was to be preserved. It has been argued that the [[standard model of cosmology]] is built upon a set of conventionalist stratagems.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Merritt|Merritt, David]]. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1355219816301563 "Cosmology and Convention"], ''Studies In History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies In History and Philosophy of Modern Physics'', '''57'''(1):41-52, February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal philosophy==
Conventionalism, as applied to [[legal philosophy]] is one of the three rival conceptions of law constructed by American legal philosopher [[Ronald Dworkin]] in his work ''[[Law's Empire]]''. The other two conceptions of law are [[legal pragmatism]] and [[law as integrity]]. 

According to conventionalism as defined by Dworkin, a community's legal institutions should contain clear social [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] relied upon which rules are promulgated. Such rules will serve as the sole source of information for all the community members because they demarcate clearly all the circumstances in which [[state coercion]] will and will not be exercised.

Dworkin nonetheless has argued that this justification fails to fit with facts as there are many occasions wherein clear applicable legal rules are absent. It follows that, as he maintained, conventionalism can provide no valid ground for [[state coercion]]. Dworkin himself favored [[law as integrity]] as the best justification of state coercion.

One famous criticism of Dworkin's idea comes from [[Stanley Fish]] who argues that Dworkin, like the [[Critical Legal Studies]] movement, [[Marxists]] and adherents of [[feminist jurisprudence]], was guilty of a false 'Theory Hope'. Fish claims that such mistake stems from their mistaken belief that there exists a general or higher 'theory' that explains or constrains all fields of activity like state coercion.

Another criticism is based on Dworkin's assertion that positivists' claims amount to conventionalism. [[H. L. A. Hart]], as a soft positivist, denies such claim as he had pointed out that citizens cannot always discover the law as plain matter of fact. It is however unclear as to whether [[Joseph Raz]], an avowed hard positivist, can be classified as conventionalist as Raz has claimed that law is composed "exclusively" of social facts which could be complex, and thus difficult to be discovered.

In particular, Dworkin has characterized law as having the main function of restraining state's coercion.{{fact|date=January 2011}} [[Nigel Simmonds]] has rejected Dworkin's disapproval of conventionalism, claiming that his characterization of law is too narrow.

In law and government, '''de jure''' ({{IPAc-en|d|eɪ|_|ˈ|dʒ|ʊər|i|,_|d|i|-}}; {{lang-la|de iure|lit=in law}} {{IPA-la|deː juːre}}) describes practices that are legally recognised, whether or not the practice exist in reality.&lt;ref name=Dictionary.cm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Dictionary.com/browse/de-jure|title=de jure|publisher=Dictionary.com, LLC.|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, {{no wrap|''[[de facto]]''}} ("in fact" or "in practice") describes situations that exist in reality, even if not legally recognised.&lt;ref name="OxfordDF2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of 'de facto' adjective from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary|url=http://www.OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com/definition/english/de-facto_2|publisher=Oxford University Press|website=OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms are often used to contrast different scenarios: for a colloquial example, "I know that, de jure, this is supposed to be a parking lot, but now that the flood has left four feet of water here, it's a de facto swimming pool".&lt;ref name="WashULaw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal English: "De Facture/De Jure"|url=https://onlinelaw.wustl.edu/blog/legal-english-de-factode-jure/|publisher=Washington University School of Law|website=@WashULaw|date=28 December 2012|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To further explain, even if the signs around the flooded parking lot say "Parking Lot" (the signs effectively being the "law" determining what it is) it is "in fact" a swimming pool (with the water, the current practical circumstances, determining what it is).

==Examples==
It is possible to have multiple simultaneous conflicting (''de jure'') legalities, possibly none of which is in force (''de facto'').  After seizing power in 1526, [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] made his brother, [[Umar Din]], the lawful (''de jure'') [[Sultan]] of [[Adal Sultanate|Adal]].

However, from about 1882, the rulers had only ''de jure'' rule over Egypt, as it had by then become a British [[puppet state]].  Thus, Egypt was by Ottoman law ''de jure'' a province of the Ottoman Empire, but ''de facto'' was part of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cfJC1zLvBhQC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijoK6thuzWAhXJExoKHTYvBTE4ChDoAQgnMAA&amp;q=veiled%20protectorate|title=The British in Egypt: Community, Crime and Crises 1882-1922|last=Mak|first=Lanver|date=2012-03-15|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781848857094|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Law of the United States|American law]], particularly after ''[[Brown v.

The Massachusetts '''Depositors Insurance Fund''' is a [[deposit insurance]] scheme that protects depositors at Massachusetts savings [[bank]]s.  It was created in 1934&lt;ref name="start"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.difxs.com/DIF/Home.aspx |title=When Safety Is Key |publisher=Depositors Insurance Fund |accessdate=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[U.S. state|state]] [[government of Massachusetts]] in response to the large number of Massachusetts bank failures during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s. This fund was the inspiration for the formation of the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC). After the FDIC was created, the state fund was modified to cover all amounts not covered by the FDIC.  Typically the FDIC covers the first $250,000;&lt;ref&gt;https://secure.umassfive.org/news/250000_ncua_share_insurance.html&lt;/ref&gt; the Massachusetts fund will cover any amount above that. As a result, account holders in Massachusetts savings banks (and Massachusetts co-operative banks, whose excess deposits are similarly insured by the Share Insurance Fund of The Co-operative Central Bank) generally have all of their deposits insured by the combination of the state fund and the FDIC.

This fund is related to, but not the same as, the national Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) administered at the U.S. national level by the FDIC.

[[File:Kansallismuseo valtaistuin.jpg|thumb|The throne used by Emperor Alexander I at the Porvoo Diet in 1809. The throne has been part of the collection of the National Museum of Finland from 1919 onwards]]
[[File:Diet of Porvoo.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Porvoo]] Diet is opened by [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]]]]

The '''Diet of Finland''' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''Suomen maapäivät'', later ''valtiopäivät''; [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''Finlands Lantdagar''), was the [[Diet (assembly)|legislative assembly]] of the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] from 1809 to 1906 and the recipient of the powers of the Swedish [[Riksdag of the Estates]]. The term ''valtiopäivät'' today means an annual session of the [[Parliament of Finland]], the Swedish ''Riksdagen'' being the name for both the Parliament and its sessions.

== Åbo Lantdag ==
[[File:Maapäivät muistokivi.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A memorial for the meeting of the states of Finland in Helsinki in 1616]]
The first [[The Estates|States]] of Finland were held in [[Helsinki]] in 1616.&lt;ref name = "aatos"&gt;[http://www.aatos.fi/Hki450v/valtaher.html  Aatos].&lt;/ref&gt;  Other assemblies ''(Åbo [[landtag|lantdag]])'' where held in [[Turku]]  for example in 1676. The assembly was called together by [[Axel Julius De la Gardie]]. The estate of peasants was chaired by [[Heikki Heikinpoika Vaanila]].

== The Porvoo Diet ==
{{main|Diet of Porvoo}}
[[File:Me Alexander I - Suuri Ruhtinas Suomen maasa.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The sovereign's pledge, printed in Finnish]]

During the [[Finnish War]] between [[Sweden]] and [[Russia]], the four [[Estates of the realm|Estates]] of occupied [[Finland]] (''Nobility, Clergy, Bourgeoisie and Peasants'') were assembled at [[Porvoo]] ''(Borgå)'' by [[Tsar]] [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], the new [[Grand Duke of Finland]], between 25 March and 19 July 1809. The central event at Porvoo was the [[Oath of office|sovereign pledge]] and the oaths of the Estates in [[Porvoo Cathedral]] on 29 March. Each of the Estates swore their [[oath of allegiance|oaths of allegiance]], committing themselves to accepting the [[Emperor]] and [[Grand Duke]] of Finland as the true authority, and to keeping the [[constitution]] and the form of government unchanged. Alexander I subsequently promised to govern Finland in accordance with its laws. This was thought to essentially mean that the emperor confirmed the Swedish [[Instrument of Government (1772)|Instrument of Government]] from 1772 as the constitution of Finland, although it was also interpreted to mean respecting the existing codes and statutes. The diet had required that it would be convened again after the Finnish War, which separated Finland from Sweden, had been concluded. On 17 September that year, the conflict was settled by the [[Treaty of Fredrikshamn]], but it would be another five decades until the Finnish Estates would be called again.

== The Estates convene again ==
[[File:Valtiopäivät 1863.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The opening of the Diet in 1863]]
Not until June 1863, after the [[Crimean War]] had taken place, did [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] call the Estates again.  On 18 September the opening ceremony was held and the Emperor made his declaration where he promised to introduce changes to the constitution.  The changes included making the diet a regularly convening body, a promise which was kept by the Emperor when the diet convened again in January 1867, where it established an act on the working order of the diet.  The diet was to convene at least every fifth year but in  practice it would come to convene every third year.  The act on [[Freedom of the Press]] was seen to have been rejected by the diet in 1867, and as a consequence [[censorship]] was introduced.  The diets of the 1860s created a working and regularly convening Finnish parliament, but it also spelled an end to further promised constitutional reforms. 

In the elections for the diet of 1872, members of the two [[Finland's language strife|language-based parties]], the [[Fennoman]]s and [[Svecoman]]s, gained more ground at the expense of the [[Liberalism|liberals]]. After the [[Church of the Savior on Blood|assassination]] of Alexander II the special position of Finland in the Russian empire was in danger.  [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] announced that the Finnish [[Markka|monetary]], customs and [[Itella|postal]] systems were to be incorporated into their imperial counterparts. At the diet of 1882 the [[Governor-General of Finland|Governor-General]] gave the Emperors announcement that the diet would have the right to submit bills, but he would be the only one to initiate changes regarding the constitution and [[Military of the Grand Duchy of Finland|military]] issues.

== The first period of oppression ==
{{main|Russification of Finland}}
In 1899 [[Grand Duke of Finland|Grand Duke]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] signed what came to be known as the [[February Manifesto]]. The powers of the diet regarding Finland's internal affairs were weakened and transferred to the Russian ministers. The legal committee of the diet of 1899 adopted the opinion that the manifesto was not legally valid in Finland.

== Reform ==
The unrest during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] resulted in a [[Finnish general strike of 1905|general strike in Finland]] in October 1905. The most immediate result was the Emperor's manifesto that cancelled all illegal regulations. A parliament based on universal and equal suffrage was also promised. An extraordinary session of the diet in December 1905 was called to implement the parliamentary reforms. The proposal was presented to the Emperor on 15 March 1906 and after his approval it was submitted to the estates on 9 May. The reforms came to force on 1 October 1906. The diet was reformed from a legislative assembly of four Estates into a unicameral parliament of 200 members. At the same time [[universal suffrage]] was introduced, which gave all men and women, 24 years or older, the right to vote and stand for election. Acts on the right of parliament to monitor members of the government, on the [[Freedom of Speech]], [[Freedom of Assembly|Assembly]] and [[Freedom of Association|Association]], and [[Freedom of the Press]] were also introduced. These reforms established the hallmarks of today's [[Parliament of Finland]]. The first [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1907|election]] to the new parliament was arranged in 1907.

== Composition in 1869–1906 ==
From 1869 to 1906 the Diet of Finland was composed as follows:
* Nobility: 201 seats; the heads of noble families had the right to sit in person or name a family member as a representative.
* Clergy: 40 seats; included bishops, priests elected from each bishopric, university personnel and other senior teachers who elected their representatives.
* Bourgeoisie: 30–70 seats; these were the representatives of the people living in cities, only men with taxable wealth were eligible to vote. The number of seats rose when the population of the cities grew.
* Peasants: 70 seats; elected through indirect election in which only peasants that owned their own land (4.5% of the rural population in early 1900s) could vote. Each district sent a representative, which was locally elected by electors, wherein each municipality could send at least one elector.

All chambers debated separately. Ordinarily there were no joint sessions, and while it was possible to arrange a joint debating session where voting was however not permitted, such sessions were only arranged twice in the history of the Diet. Three chambers had to pass the bill before it could be approved by the [[Emperor of Russia|Emperor]]. However, consensus was sought in joint committees, and in case of disagreements, a committee was set to reconcile the differences between the versions passed by different chambers. Any bill affecting the privileges of an estate could be passed only with the consent of that estate. All four chambers had to agree in order to modify constitutional laws.

== Sessions and meeting places of the Diet ==
[[File:Säätytalo, Ständerhuset (Finland), Maison des États (Finlande), Houseof the Estates (Finland).jpg|thumb|right|300px|The House of the Estates in [[Johan Vilhelm Snellman|Snellmaninkatu]] in Helsinki was the meeting place of the [[Estates of the realm|lower estates]]]]

* 1863–1864 (September 1863 to April 1864);

* 1872 (February to June);

* 1885 (January to May);
* 1888 (January to May);
* 1891 (January to May);

* 1900 (January to June);
* 1904–1905 (December 1904 to April 1905);
* 1906 (January to September);

The Diet of Finland, and the four estates of which it was composed, met in a number of different locations during its existence. In the 1860s, all the estates met in the [[Finnish House of Nobility]]. Whilst the [[Finnish estate of nobility|Nobility of Finland]] continued to meet there until 1906, the three commoner estates later met in other locations, such as in 1888, when they met in the new building of the Ateneum Art Museum. From 1891 until the parliamentary reform of 1906 the three commoner estates of Clergy, Bourgeoisie and Peasants met in the newly built House of the Estates (Finnish ''[[Säätytalo]]'', Swedish ''Ständerhuset''). However, the meeting rooms of the house were too small for the 200-member unicameral parliament. The house has since seen sporadic use by the state and regular use by scientific and scholarly organizations.

The executive board has 11 members: five representatives from the board of directors, three gubernatorial appointees and three public representatives selected by the board of directors. The board of directors includes a representative from each member utility.

The consortium’s nuclear, hydro, wind, and solar projects deliver nearly 1,300 megawatts of electricity to the Northwest power grid. Current power projects include [[White Bluffs Solar Station]], [[Packwood Lake Hydroelectric Project]], [[Nine Canyon Wind Project]], and [[Columbia Generating Station]] [[nuclear power plant]].

Energy Northwest functions as a [[municipal corporation]], similar to a town or city. That legal status allows the agency to issue public bonds to raise the financial capital necessary to build additional power generating and other public utility facilities.

New power generating facilities currently under consideration include additional [[wind power]] sites throughout Washington; a 320-megawatt natural gas plant in [[Kalama, Washington|Kalama]] and a carbonless energy park in eastern Washington, as well as three solar projects in [[Oregon]] at 5-megawatts each. The agency also provides a variety of business services in the energy, power generation and technical fields, including a range of project management and facility operations and maintenance services.

In April 2006, Energy Northwest achieved [[ISO 14001|ISO 14001:2004]] registration, formalizing its environment stewardship program.

==History==
[[Image:Satsop Development Park 07780.JPG|thumb|Washington Public Power Supply System Nuclear Power Plants 3 and 5 were never completed. Funded by Joseph Collins.]]
[[File:Inside an Incomplete Satsop Cooling Tower - Mercator Projection.jpg|thumb|Inside an Incomplete Satsop Cooling Tower - Mercator Projection]]
The public power movement gained prominence in the 1920s and 1930s under the leadership of the [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Washington State Grange]], a non-partisan, grassroots advocacy group for rural citizens with both legislative programs and community activities. Public utility districts were created to provide reliable, low-cost power for the growing state.

On Jan. 31, 1957, the state legislature created the Washington Public Power Supply System, now known as Energy Northwest, as a joint operating agency to share the risks and rewards of building and operating electrical generating facilities. The power was to be provided, at the cost of production, to the ratepayers of those public utilities participating in the agency’s new projects.

The first generating source to be developed was the Packwood Lake Hydroelectric Project, located in Lewis County, Washington State approximately 20 miles south of Mount Rainier. The 27.5 megawatt project was designed to produce electricity while protecting the natural environment. Packwood continues to produce power into its fifth decade of operation. In February 2008, Energy Northwest submitted an application to renew the project’s operating license for an additional 50 years to the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]]. The agency expects to receive a license renewal for the project in 2010.

In September 1962, Congress passed and President [[John F. Kennedy]] signed a bill authorizing construction of a new dual-purpose nuclear reactor (the [[N Reactor]]) on the Hanford nuclear reservation. It was designed to produce both [[weapons-grade plutonium]] and steam to power turbine generators – thus its designation as a dual-purpose reactor. With support from U.S. Senator [[Henry "Scoop" Jackson]], the agency made a successful pitch to be the non-federal operator of the steam generator half of the project. President Kennedy presided over the groundbreaking in September 1963. Commercial operation of the 860-megawatt Hanford Generating Project began in April 1966.

For the agency, under the regionally developed Hydro-Thermal Power Program, the 1970s brought the challenge of attempting to simultaneously construct multiple nuclear power plants. Over-commitment to nuclear power brought about the financial collapse of the Washington Public Power Supply System, which undertook to build five large [[nuclear power plant]]s in the 1970s. Other groups, including the city of Seattle, questioned the feasibility of the project. In July 1976, the Seattle City Council voted against participating in the building of the project 4 and 5 nuclear power plants based, citing a 12-volume study that recommended a program of conservation and alternative energy sources instead of participation in the nuclear plants.&lt;ref name=lsoabnflr/&gt;

Managing director Neil Strand resigned in February 1980, after being under fire for several months due to the cost overruns and construction delays at the five nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name=wppsmgrs&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nQokAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IQgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6933%2C3992068|work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=WPPSS manager resigns |date=February 9, 1980 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been in the lead position for nearly three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JaQSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MvkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2938%2C2335807 |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=(Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=WPPSS chief resigning post |date=February 8, 1980 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1982, cost overruns and delays, along with a slowing of electricity demand growth, led to cancellation of two WPPSS plants and a construction halt on the two-reactor Satsop Nuclear Power Plant which was 75% complete.&lt;ref name=srscrap&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=C_lLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=l-4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1000%2C2782481 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=WPPSS director calls for slowdown on 3 other plants |date=January 23, 1982 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=termnupi&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vlUaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WicEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6973%2C1819763|work=Spokane Chronicle |location=(Washington) |agency=UPI |last=MacDonald |first=Jay |title=Termination |date=January 23, 1982 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eighteen months later in July 1983, WPPSS defaulted on [[United States dollar|$]]2.25&amp;nbsp;billion of [[municipal bonds]],&lt;ref name=bhptsodev&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=M1dOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=h_kDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5669%2C2313741 |work=Spokane Chronicle |location=(Washington)|last=Camden |first=Jim |title=Bondholders plan to sue over default |date=July 26, 1983 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wdefdecsp&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1983/07/26/wppss-default-is-declared-but-market-unmoved/329fe0a4-7df5-49de-8524-4a7d11aa4aa2/ |work=Washington Post |last=Ross |first=Nancy L. |title=WPPSS default is declared, but market unmoved|date=July 26, 1983 |accessdate=September 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the second largest municipal bond default in U.S. history.&lt;ref name="usnews.com" /&gt; The court case that followed took nearly a decade to resolve, and WPPSS acquired the unfortunate nickname "Whoops" in {{nowrap|the media.&lt;ref name="time.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780511389283 Cambridge University Press Nuclear Implosions: The Rise and Fall of the Washington Public Power Supply System] Retrieved 2008-11-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0QLT/is_2008_June/ai_n26676508 |title=Review of 'Nuclear implosions; the rise and fall of the Washington Public Power Supply System' |date=June 2008 |work=SciTech Book News |accessdate=2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2008082460_nukeop31.html |title=A Northwest distaste for nuclear power |last= Pope|first=Daniel |date=July 31, 2008 |work=Seattle Times |accessdate=2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fuel loading at Columbia Generating Station began on Dec. 25, 1983, and proceeded at a rate of 50 fuel assemblies per day. The process was completed Jan. 12, 1984, and Columbia was declared in commercial operation Dec. 13, 1984. On Jan 19, 2010, Energy Northwest submitted an application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a 20-year license renewal of Columbia Generating Station. The current license will expire near the end of 2023. License renewal is a NRC process that takes approximately 2½ years from the application submittal date.

The agency built and continues to operate White Bluffs Solar Station demonstration project, which was dedicated in May 2002. The low-maintenance, environmentally friendly project uses 242 photovoltaic panels to reach a production capacity of 38.7 kilowatts DC.

Energy Northwest next built and continues to operate the region’s first public power wind project – Nine Canyon Wind Project. It was dedicated in October 2002, with a second phase going online in December 2003, and the third and final phase in service in May 2008, bringing the total capacity to 95.9 megawatts.

{{Forensic science|all}}
'''Forensic science''' is the application of [[science]] to [[Criminal law|criminal]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil laws]], mainly—on the criminal side—during [[criminal investigation]], as governed by the legal standards of [[admissible evidence]] and [[criminal procedure]].

Forensic scientists collect, preserve, and analyze scientific [[evidence]] during the course of an investigation. While some forensic scientists travel to the scene of the crime to collect the evidence themselves, others occupy a laboratory role, performing analysis on objects brought to them by other individuals.&lt;ref name="job desc"&gt;{{cite web | title=Job Description for Forensic Laboratory Scientists | website=Crime Scene Investigator EDU | accessdate=28 August 2015 | url=http://www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org/forensic-scientist-job-description/ | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906092342/http://www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org/forensic-scientist-job-description/ | archivedate=6 September 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to their laboratory role, forensic scientists testify as [[expert witness]]es in both criminal and civil cases and can work for either the [[Prosecutor|prosecution]] or the defense. While any field could technically be ''forensic'', certain sections have developed over time to encompass the majority of forensically related cases.&lt;ref name="aafs sections"&gt;{{cite web | title=Sections | website=American Academy of Forensic Sciences | date=27 August 2015 | accessdate=28 August 2015 | url=http://www.aafs.org/about-aafs/sections/ | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150830013131/http://www.aafs.org/about-aafs/sections/ | archivedate=30 August 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Forensic science is the combination of two different Latin words: forensis and science. The former, forensic, relates to a discussion or examination performed in public. Because trials in the ancient world were typically held in public, it carries a strong judicial connotation. The second is science, which is derived from the Latin word for knowledge and is today closely tied to the scientific method, a systematic way of acquiring knowledge. Taken together, then, forensic science can be seen as the use of the scientific methods and processes in crime solving.

==Etymology==
The word ''forensic'' comes from the Latin term ''forensis'', meaning "of or before the forum".&lt;ref&gt;{{ShorterOxfordEnglishDictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the term originates from Roman times, during which a criminal charge meant presenting the case before a group of public individuals in the [[Roman Forum|forum]]. Both the person accused of the crime and the accuser would give speeches based on their sides of the story. The case would be decided in favor of the individual with the best argument and delivery. This origin is the source of the two modern usages of the word ''forensic'' – as a form of legal evidence and as a category of public presentation. In modern use, the term ''forensics'' in the place of ''forensic science'' can be considered correct, as the term ''forensic'' is effectively a [[synonym]] for ''legal'' or ''related to courts''. However, the term is now so closely associated with the scientific field that many dictionaries include the meaning that equates the word ''forensics'' with ''forensic science''.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}

===Origins of forensic science and early methods===
{{main|Forensics in antiquity}}
The [[Ancient history|ancient world]] lacked standardized forensic practices, which aided criminals in escaping punishment. Criminal investigations and trials heavily relied on forced [[Confession (law)|confession]]s and witness [[testimony]]. However, ancient sources do contain several accounts of techniques that foreshadow concepts in forensic science that were developed centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schafer|first=Elizabeth D.|title=Forensic Science|chapter=Ancient science and forensics|editor=Ayn Embar-seddon, Allan D. Pass (eds.)|publisher=Salem Press|year=2008|page=40|isbn=978-1-58765-423-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first written account of using [[medicine]] and [[entomology]] to solve criminal cases is attributed to the book of [[Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified|''Xi Yuan Lu'']] (translated as ''Washing Away of Wrongs''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/forensics/timeline.html |title=Forensics Timeline |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629040006/http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/forensics/timeline.html |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vizproto.prism.asu.edu/classes/sp05/todd_c/forensic_site/intro.html A Brief Background of Forensic Science] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216092646/http://vizproto.prism.asu.edu/classes/sp05/todd_c/forensic_site/intro.html |date=16 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), written in China by [[Song Ci]] (宋慈, 1186–1249) in 1248, who was a director of justice, jail and supervision,&lt;ref&gt;Song, Ci, and Brian E. McKnight. ''The washing away of wrongs: forensic medicine in thirteenth-century China''. Ann Arbor: Center for Chinese Studies, U of Michigan, 1981. Print. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Song dynasty]].

In one of Song Ci's accounts (''Washing Away of Wrongs''), the case of a person murdered with a sickle was solved by an investigator who instructed everyone to bring his sickle to one location. (He realized it was a sickle by testing various blades on an animal carcass and comparing the wound.) Flies, attracted by the smell of blood, eventually gathered on a single sickle. In light of this, the murderer confessed. For example, the book also described how to distinguish between a [[drowning]] (water in the [[lungs]]) and [[strangulation]] (broken neck [[cartilage]]), along with other evidence from examining corpses on determining if a death was caused by murder, suicide or an accident.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Methods from around the world involved saliva and examination of the mouth and tongue to determine innocence or guilt, as a precursor to the [[Polygraph test]]. In ancient [[India]],&lt;ref name=EDodD&gt;{{cite book|last=Parmeshwaranand|first=Swami|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of the Dharmaśāstra, Volume 1|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|location=[[New Delhi]]|isbn=8176253650|page=499|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDQVereyvj4C&amp;pg=PA499#v=onepage&amp;q=rice&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; some suspects were made to fill their mouths with dried rice and spit it back out.

===Development of forensic science===
[[File:Ambroise Paré.jpg|thumb|[[Ambroise Paré]]'s surgical work laid the groundwork for the development of forensic techniques in the following centuries.]]
In 16th-century Europe, medical practitioners in army and university settings began to gather information on the cause and [[manner of death]]. [[Ambroise Paré]], a French army [[surgery|surgeon]], systematically studied the effects of violent death on internal organs.&lt;ref name=GAB&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Jack|title=Gunpowder: Alchemy, Bombards, and Pyrotechnics: The History of the Explosive ...|publisher=Basic Books|location=[[New York City|New York]]|isbn=0465037186|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8xfs8tC8Ow0C&amp;pg=PA79|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723015656/https://books.google.com/books?id=8xfs8tC8Ow0C&amp;pg=PA79|archivedate=23 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porter|first1=Roy|title=The Cambridge History of Science: Volume 3, Early Modern Science|page=805|author2=Lorraine Daston|author3=Katharine Park}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[Italian people|Italian]] surgeons, Fortunato Fidelis and Paolo Zacchia, laid the foundation of modern [[pathology]] by studying changes that occurred in the structure of the body as the result of disease.&lt;ref name=THSC&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suter|first1=Patricia|title=The Hanging of Susanna Cox: The True Story of Pennsylvania's Most Notorious Infanticide and the Legend that Kept it Alive|publisher=Stackpole Books|location=Mechanicsberg|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=frLETA3uU08C&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=Fortunato+Fidelis+and+Paolo+Zacchia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=H-RoU-ytJIi5uATgrIGQCg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Fortunato%20Fidelis%20and%20Paolo%20Zacchia&amp;f=false|author2=Russell D.

As the rational values of the [[Enlightenment era]] increasingly permeated society in the 18th century, criminal investigation became a more evidence-based, rational procedure − the use of torture to force confessions was curtailed, and belief in witchcraft and other powers of the [[occult]] largely ceased to influence the court's decisions. Two examples of English forensic science in individual legal proceedings demonstrate the increasing use of [[logic]] and [[Procedure (term)|procedure]] in criminal investigations at the time. In 1784, in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], John Toms was tried and convicted for murdering Edward Culshaw with a [[pistol]]. When the dead body of Culshaw was examined, a pistol wad (crushed paper used to secure powder and balls in the muzzle) found in his head wound matched perfectly with a torn newspaper found in Toms's pocket, leading to the conviction.&lt;ref name=SW&gt;{{cite book|last=McCrery|first=Nigel|title=Silent Witnesses|publisher=Random House Books|location=London|isbn=9781847946836|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dynVJYcteEkC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513220434/https://books.google.com/books?id=dynVJYcteEkC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=13 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Warwick]] 1816, a farm laborer was tried and convicted of the murder of a young maidservant. She had been drowned in a shallow pool and bore the marks of violent assault. The police found footprints and an impression from corduroy cloth with a sewn patch in the damp earth near the pool. There were also scattered grains of [[wheat]] and chaff. The breeches of a farm labourer who had been threshing wheat nearby were examined and corresponded exactly to the impression in the earth near the pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Science Against Crime|vauthors=Kind S, Overman M |publisher=Doubleday|location=New York City|year=1972|isbn=0-385-09249-0|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toxicology and ballistics===
A method for detecting arsenious oxide, simple [[arsenic]], in corpses was devised in 1773 by the Swedish chemist, [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]].&lt;ref name=DPaC&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Suzanne|title=Drugs, Poisons, and Chemistry|publisher=Facts on File|location=[[New York City|New York]]|isbn=0816055106|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lq8IvpohnCwC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427082830/https://books.google.com/books?id=lq8IvpohnCwC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=27 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work was expanded, in 1806, by German chemist Valentin Ross, who learned to detect the poison in the walls of a victim's stomach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forensic Analysis and DNA in Criminal Investigations: INCLUDING COLD CASES SOLVED|last=Parker|first=RJ|publisher=RJ Parker Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781514348369|location=|pages=66|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Marsh test apparatus.jpg|thumb|left|Apparatus for the arsenic test, devised by [[James Marsh (chemist)|James Marsh]].]]
[[James Marsh (chemist)|James Marsh]] was the first to apply this new science to the art of forensics. He was called by the prosecution in a murder trial to give evidence as a chemist in 1832. The defendant, John Bodle, was accused of poisoning his grandfather with arsenic-laced coffee. Marsh performed the standard test by mixing a suspected sample with [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[hydrochloric acid]]. While he was able to detect arsenic as yellow [[arsenic trisulfide]], when it was shown to the jury it had deteriorated, allowing the suspect to be acquitted due to reasonable doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/visibleproofs/galleries/technologies/marsh.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007131101/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/visibleproofs/galleries/technologies/marsh.html |archivedate=7 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annoyed by that, Marsh developed a much better test. He combined a sample containing arsenic with [[sulfuric acid]] and arsenic-free [[zinc]], resulting in [[arsine]] gas. The gas was ignited, and it decomposed to pure metallic arsenic, which, when passed to a cold surface, would appear as a silvery-black deposit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McMuigan|first=Hugh|title=An Introduction to Chemical Pharmacology|publisher=P.

He first described this test in ''The Edinburgh Philosophical Journal'' in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Account of a method of separating small quantities of arsenic from substances with which it may be mixed|journal=Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal|volume=21|year=1836|pages=229–236|author=James Marsh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FR4AAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA229#v=onepage&amp;q=%22detecting%20the%20presence%22&amp;f=false|publisher=A. and C.

Henry Goddard at [[Scotland Yard]] pioneered the use of bullet comparison in 1835. He noticed a flaw in the bullet that killed the victim and was able to trace this back to the mold that was used in the manufacturing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.bryant.edu/~ehu/h453proj/forensic1/Ballistics.htm|title=Ballistics|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017052224/http://web.bryant.edu/~ehu/h453proj/forensic1/Ballistics.htm|archivedate=17 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthropometry===
[[Image:Bertillon - Signalement Anthropometrique.png|right|thumb|150px|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] from [[Alphonse Bertillon|Bertillon's]] ''Identification anthropométrique'' (1893), demonstrating the measurements needed for his anthropometric identification system.]]
The French police officer [[Alphonse Bertillon]] was the first to apply the anthropological technique of [[anthropometry]] to law enforcement, thereby creating an identification system based on physical measurements. Before that time, criminals could only be identified by name or photograph.&lt;ref&gt;As reported in, "A Fingerprint Fable: The Will and William West Case". {{cite web |url=http://www.scafo.org/library/110105.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110105229/http://www.scafo.org/library/110105.html |archivedate=10 November 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirsten Moana Thompson 2007"&gt;Kirsten Moana Thompson, ''Crime Films: Investigating the Scene''. London: Wallflower Press (2007): 10&lt;/ref&gt; Dissatisfied with the ''ad hoc'' methods used to identify captured criminals in France in the 1870s, he began his work on developing a reliable system of anthropometrics for human classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ginzburg|first=Carlo|authorlink=Carlo Ginzburg|year=1984|chapter=Morelli, Freud, and Sherlock Holmes: Clues and Scientific Method|page=105|editor1-last=Eco|editor1-first=Umberto|editor1-link=Umberto Eco|editor2-last=Sebeok|editor2-first=Thomas|editor2-link=Thomas Sebeok|title=The Sign of Three: Dupin, Holmes, Peirce|location=Bloomington, IN|publisher=''History Workshop'', Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-35235-4|lccn=82049207|oclc=9412985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bertillon created many other [[forensics]] techniques, including [[forensic document examination]], the use of [[galvanoplastic]] compounds to preserve [[footprint]]s, [[ballistics]], and the [[dynamometer]], used to determine the degree of force used in [[burglary|breaking and entering]]. Although his central methods were soon to be supplanted by [[fingerprinting]], "his other contributions like the [[mug shot]] and the systematization of crime-scene photography remain in place to this day."&lt;ref name="Kirsten Moana Thompson 2007"/&gt;

===Fingerprints===
Sir [[Sir William Herschel, 2nd Baronet|William Herschel]] was one of the first to advocate the use of fingerprinting in the identification of criminal suspects. While working for the [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|Indian Civil Service]], he began to use thumbprints on documents as a security measure to prevent the then-rampant repudiation of signatures in 1858.&lt;ref name="Herschel1916"&gt;{{Cite book|first=William J|last=Herschel|title=The Origin of Finger-Printing|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1916|isbn=978-1-104-66225-7|url=http://galton.org/fingerprints/books/herschel/herschel-1916-origins-1up.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725022215/http://galton.org/fingerprints/books/herschel/herschel-1916-origins-1up.pdf|archivedate=25 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fingerprints taken by William James Herschel 1859-1860.jpg|thumb|left|Fingerprints taken by [[William Herschel]] 1859/60.]]
In 1877 at Hooghly (near Kolkata), Herschel instituted the use of fingerprints on contracts and deeds, and he registered government pensioners' fingerprints to prevent the collection of money by relatives after a pensioner's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=William James|last=Herschel|title=Skin furrows of the hand|journal=Nature|volume=23|issue=578|page=76|date=25 November 1880|bibcode=1880Natur..23...76H|doi=10.1038/023076b0|url=http://galton.org/fingerprints/herschel-1880-nature-furrows.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615200727/http://galton.org/fingerprints/herschel-1880-nature-furrows.pdf|archivedate=15 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, Dr. [[Henry Faulds]], a Scottish surgeon in a [[Tokyo]] hospital, published his first paper on the subject in the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', discussing the usefulness of fingerprints for identification and proposing a method to record them with printing ink. He established their first classification and was also the first to identify fingerprints left on a vial.&lt;ref name=faulds1&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.galton.org/fingerprints/faulds-1880-nature-furrows.pdf|last=Faulds|first=Henry|title=On the skin-furrows of the hand|journal=Nature|volume=22|issue=574|page=605|date=28 October 1880|doi=10.1038/022605a0|bibcode=1880Natur..22..605F|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912031154/http://www.galton.org/fingerprints/faulds-1880-nature-furrows.pdf|archivedate=12 September 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to the UK in 1886, he offered the concept to the [[Metropolitan Police]] in London, but it was dismissed at that time.&lt;ref name=reid1&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reid|first=Donald L.|year=2003|title=Dr. Henry Faulds – Beith Commemorative Society|journal=Journal of Forensic Identification|volume=53|issue=2}} See also this on-line article on Henry Faulds: {{cite web|url=http://www.galton.org/fingerprints/faulds.htm#herschel1880|title=Henry Faulds: the Invention of a Fingerprinter|first=Gavan|last=Tredoux|date=December 2003|publisher=galton.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602152655/http://galton.org/fingerprints/faulds.htm#herschel1880|archivedate=2 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faulds wrote to [[Charles Darwin]] with a description of his method, but, too old and ill to work on it, Darwin gave the information to his cousin, [[Francis Galton]], who was interested in anthropology. Having been thus inspired to study fingerprints for ten years, Galton published a detailed statistical model of fingerprint analysis and identification and encouraged its use in forensic science in his book ''Finger Prints''. He had calculated that the chance of a "false positive" (two different individuals having the same fingerprints) was about 1 in 64 billion.&lt;ref name=galtonfps&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clpex.com/Information/Pioneers/galton-1892-fingerprints-lowres.pdf|last=Galton|first=Francis|year=1892|title=Finger Prints|location=London|publisher=MacMillan and Co|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012152917/http://www.clpex.com/Information/Pioneers/galton-1892-fingerprints-lowres.pdf|archivedate=12 October 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fingerprinting 1928.jpg|thumb|Women clerical employees of the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LA Police Department]] getting [[fingerprint]]ed and photographed in 1928.]]
[[Juan Vucetich]], an Argentine chief police officer, created the first method of recording the fingerprints of individuals on file. In 1892, after studying Galton's pattern types, Vucetich set up the world's first fingerprint bureau. In that same year, Francisca Rojas of [[Necochea]] was found in a house with neck injuries whilst her two sons were found dead with their throats cut. Rojas accused a neighbour, but despite brutal interrogation, this neighbour would not confess to the crimes. Inspector Alvarez, a colleague of Vucetich, went to the scene and found a bloody thumb mark on a door. When it was compared with Rojas' prints, it was found to be identical with her right thumb. She then confessed to the murder of her sons.

A Fingerprint Bureau was established in Calcutta ([[Kolkata]]), India, in 1897, after the Council of the Governor General approved a committee report that fingerprints should be used for the classification of criminal records. Working in the Calcutta Anthropometric Bureau, before it became the Fingerprint Bureau, were [[Azizul Haque (police officer)|Azizul Haque]] and [[Hem Chandra Bose]]. Haque and Bose were Indian fingerprint experts who have been credited with the primary development of a fingerprint classification system eventually named after their supervisor, [[Edward Henry|Sir Edward Richard Henry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Tewari|first1=RK|last2=Ravikumar|first2=KV|title=History and development of forensic science in India|journal=J Postgrad Med|year=2000|issue=46|pages=303–308}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jan102005/185.pdf|first1=J.S.|last1=Sodhi|first2=asjeed|last2=Kaur|title=The forgotten Indian pioneers of finger print science|journal=Current Science|year=2005|volume=88|issue=1|pages=185–191|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208112115/http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jan102005/185.pdf|archivedate=8 February 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Henry Classification System]], co-devised by Haque and Bose, was accepted in England and Wales when the first United Kingdom Fingerprint Bureau was founded in [[Scotland Yard]], the [[Metropolitan Police]] headquarters, London, in 1901.

In the United States, Dr. Henry P. DeForrest used fingerprinting in the [[New York Police Department|New York Civil Service]] in 1902, and by December 1905, [[New York City Police Department]] Deputy Commissioner Joseph A. Faurot, an expert in the [[Alphonse Bertillon|Bertillon]] system and a fingerprint advocate at Police Headquarters, introduced the fingerprinting of criminals to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to U.S. 23 Dec 1905 New York – The City Record Volume 33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uhlenhuth test===
The [[Uhlenhuth test]], or the antigen–antibody [[precipitin]] test for species, was invented by [[Paul Uhlenhuth]] in 1901 and could distinguish human [[blood]] from animal blood, based on the discovery that the blood of different species had one or more characteristic proteins. The test represented a major breakthrough and came to have tremendous importance in forensic science.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kurland, ''Irrefutable Evidence: A History of Forensic Science'' (p. 200), Dee, 2009, {{ISBN|9781461662396}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test was further refined for forensic use by the Swiss chemist Maurice Müller in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Inman, Norah Rudin, ''Principles and Practice of Criminalistics: The Profession of Forensic Science'' (p. 32), CRC Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===DNA===
Forensic [[DNA profiling|DNA analysis]] was first used in 1984. It was developed by Sir [[Alec Jeffreys]], who realized that variation in the genetic code could be used to identify individuals and to tell individuals apart from one another. The first application of DNA profiles was used by Jefferys in a double murder mystery in the small English town of [[Narborough, Leicestershire]] in 1985. A 15-year-old school girl by the name of Lynda Mann was raped and murdered in Carlton Hayes psychiatric hospital. The police did not find a suspect but were able to obtain a semen sample.

In 1986, Dawn Ashworth, 15 years old, was also raped and strangled in a nearby village of [[Enderby, Leicestershire|Enderby]]. Forensic evidence showed that both killers had the same blood type. Richard Buckland became the suspect because he worked at Carlton Hayes psychiatric hospital, had been spotted near Dawn Ashworth's murder scene and knew unreleased details about the body. He later confessed to Dawn's murder but not Lynda's.  Jefferys was brought into the case to analyze the semen samples. He concluded that there was no match between the samples and Buckland, who became the first person to be exonerated using DNA. Jefferys confirmed that the DNA profiles were identical for the two murder semen samples. To find the perpetrator, DNA samples from the entire male population, more than 4,000 aged from 17 to 34, of the town were collected. They all were compared to semen samples from the crime.  A friend of [[Colin Pitchfork]] was heard saying that he had given his sample to the police claiming to be Colin. Colin Pitchfork was arrested in 1987 and it was found that his DNA profile matched the semen samples from the murder.

Because of this case, DNA databases were developed. There is the national (FBI) and international databases as well as the European countries (ENFSI : European Network of Forensic Science Institutes). These searchable databases are used to match crime scene DNA profiles to those already in a database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploreforensics.co.uk/forensic-cases-colin-pitchfork-first-exoneration-through-dna.html|title=Forensic Cases: Colin Pitchfork, First Exoneration Through DNA|website=www.exploreforensics.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maturation===
[[File:JacktheRipperPuck.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Cartoon of a man holding a bloody knife looking contemptuously at a display of half-a-dozen supposed and dissimilar likenesses|Police brought to bear the latest techniques of forensic science in their attempts to identify and capture the serial killer [[Jack the Ripper]].]]
By the turn of the 20th century, the science of forensics had become largely established in the sphere of criminal investigation. Scientific and surgical investigation was widely employed by the [[Metropolitan Police]] during their pursuit of the mysterious [[Jack the Ripper]], who had killed a number of [[prostitute]]s in the 1880s. This case is a watershed in the application of forensic science. Large teams of policemen conducted house-to-house inquiries throughout Whitechapel. Forensic material was collected and examined. Suspects were identified, traced and either examined more closely or eliminated from the inquiry. Police work follows the same pattern today.&lt;ref name=canter12&gt;[[David Canter|Canter, David]] (1994), ''Criminal Shadows: Inside the Mind of the Serial Killer'', London: HarperCollins, pp. 12–13, {{ISBN|0-00-255215-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 2000 people were interviewed, "upwards of 300" people were investigated, and 80 people were detained.&lt;ref&gt;Inspector [[Donald Swanson]]'s report to the Home Office, {{Nowrap|19 October}} 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', p. 205; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 113; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation was initially conducted by the [[Criminal Investigation Department]] (CID), headed by Detective Inspector [[Edmund Reid]]. Later, Detective Inspectors [[Frederick Abberline]], [[Henry Moore (police officer)|Henry Moore]], and [[Walter Simon Andrews|Walter Andrews]] were sent from Central Office at [[Scotland Yard]] to assist. Initially, butchers, surgeons and physicians were suspected because of the manner of the mutilations. The alibis of local butchers and slaughterers were investigated, with the result that they were eliminated from the inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Inspector Donald Swanson's report to the [[Home Office]], {{Nowrap|19 October}} 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', p. 206 and Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Some contemporary figures thought the pattern of the murders indicated that the culprit was a butcher or cattle drover on one of the cattle boats that plied between London and mainland Europe.

[[File:Abbe-03.jpg|thumb|left|The popular fictional character [[Sherlock Holmes]] was in many ways ahead of his time in his use of forensic analysis.]]
''Handbook for Coroners, police officials, military policemen'' was written by the [[Austrians|Austrian]] criminal jurist [[Hans Gross]] in 1893, and is generally acknowledged as the birth of the field of criminalistics. The work combined in one system fields of knowledge that had not been previously integrated, such as psychology and physical science, and which could be successfully used against crime. Gross adapted some fields to the needs of criminal investigation, such as [[crime scene photography]]. He went on to found the Institute of Criminalistics in 1912, as part of the University of Graz' Law School. This Institute was followed by many similar institutes all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Green|first=Martin|title=Otto Gross, Freudian Psychoanalyst, 1877–1920|publisher=[[Edwin Mellen Press]]|year=1999|location=Lampeter,|isbn=0-7734-8164-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, [[Archibald Reiss]] founded the ''Institut de police scientifique'' of the [[University of Lausanne|University of Lausanne (UNIL)]], the first school of forensic science in the world. Dr. [[Edmond Locard]], became known as the "[[Sherlock Holmes]] of [[France]]". He formulated the basic principle of forensic science: "Every contact leaves a trace", which became known as [[Locard's exchange principle]]. In 1910, he founded what may have been the first criminal laboratory in the world, after persuading the Police Department of [[Lyon]] (France) to give him two attic rooms and two assistants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apsu.edu/oconnort/3210/3210lect02.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206090107/http://www.apsu.edu/oconnort/3210/3210lect02.htm|date=6 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic of the new found prestige of forensics and the use of reasoning in detective work was the popularity of the fictional character [[Sherlock Holmes]], written by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] in the late 19th century. He remains a great inspiration for forensic science, especially for the way his acute study of a crime scene yielded small clues as to the precise sequence of events. He made great use of [[trace evidence]] such as shoe and tire impressions, as well as fingerprints, [[ballistics]] and handwriting analysis, now known as [[questioned document examination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yMDWLq2FdrIC|title=Oxford studies in epistemology|editors=Tamar Szabo Gendler and John Hawthorne|author=Alexander Bird |chapter=Abductive Knowledge and Holmesian Inference |page=11 |isbn=978-0-19-928590-7 |date=27 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such evidence is used to test theories conceived by the police, for example, or by the investigator himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia Sherlockiana |author=Matthew Bunson |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aSgfAQAAIAAJ |page=50 |isbn=978-0-671-79826-0 |date=19 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the techniques advocated by Holmes later became reality, but were generally in their infancy at the time Conan Doyle was writing. In many of his reported cases, Holmes frequently complains of the way the crime scene has been contaminated by others, especially by the police, emphasising the critical importance of maintaining its integrity, a now well-known feature of crime scene examination. He used [[analytical chemistry]] for [[blood residue]] analysis as well as [[toxicology]] examination and determination for poisons. He used [[ballistics]] by measuring bullet [[caliber|calibres]] and matching them with a suspected murder weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fact and feeling: Baconian science and the nineteenth-Century literary imagination |page=214 |author=Jonathan Smith |year=1994 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hFn1Zx_desIC |isbn=978-0-299-14354-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Late 19th – early 20th centuries figures===
Hans Gross applied scientific methods to crime scenes and was responsible for the birth of criminalistics.

Edmund Locard expanded on Gross' work with Locard's Exchange Principle which stated "whenever two objects come into contact with one another, materials are exchanged between them". This means that every contact by a criminal leaves a trace. Locard was also known as the "Sherlock Holmes of France".

Alexander Lacassagne, who taught Locard, produced autopsy standards on actual forensic cases.

Alphonse Bertillon was a French criminologist and founder of Anthropometry (scientific study of measurements and proportions of the human body). He used anthropometry for identification, saying each individual is unique and by measuring aspect of physical difference, there could be a personal identification system. He created the Bertillon System around 1879, which was a way to identify criminals and citizens by measuring 20 parts of the body. In 1884, there was over 240 repeat offenders caught through the Bertillon system. Fingerprinting became more reliable than the Bertillon system.

Frances Glessner Lee, known as "the mother of forensic science,"&lt;ref&gt;https://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/nutshells&lt;/ref&gt; was instrumental in the development of forensic science in the US. She lobbied to have coroners replaced by medical professionals, endowed the Harvard Associates in Police Science, and conducted many seminars to educate homicide investigators. She also created the Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death, intricate crime scene dioramas used to train investigators. They are still in use today.

===20th century===
[[File:Alec Jeffreys -2008.jpg|thumb|[[Alec Jeffreys]] invented the [[DNA profiling]] technique in 1984.]]
Later in the 20th century several British pathologists, [[Mikey Rochman]], [[Francis Camps]], [[Sydney Smith (forensic expert)|Sydney Smith]] and [[Keith Simpson (professor)|Keith Simpson]] pioneered new forensic science methods. [[Alec Jeffreys]] pioneered the use of [[DNA profiling]] in forensic science in 1984. He realized the scope of DNA fingerprinting, which uses variations in the [[genetic code]] to identify individuals. The method has since become important in forensic science to assist police detective work, and it has also proved useful in resolving paternity and immigration disputes.&lt;ref name="welcome 2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_wtd020877.html |title=Discovering DNA fingerprinting:  Sir Alec Jeffreys describes its development |publisher=[[Wellcome Trust]] |date=4 February 2004 |first=Giles |last=Newton |accessdate=23 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uFbTpIUx?url=http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_wtd020877.html |archivedate=15 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA fingerprinting was first used as a police forensic test to identify the rapist and killer of two teenagers, Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, who were both murdered in [[Narborough, Leicestershire]], in 1983 and 1986 respectively. [[Colin Pitchfork]] was identified and convicted of murder after samples taken from him matched [[semen]] samples taken from the two dead girls.

Forensic science has been fostered by a number of national forensic science learned bodies including the [[Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csofs.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609094436/http://www.csofs.org/|date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (founded in 1959), then known as the Forensic Science Society, publisher of ''[[Science &amp; Justice]]'';.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csofs.org/publications |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615161534/http://www.csofs.org/Publications |archivedate=15 June 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Academy of Forensic Sciences]] (founded 1948), publishers of the ''[[Journal of Forensic Sciences]]'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aafs.org/journal-forensic-sciences ''Journal of Forensic Sciences''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123140138/http://www.aafs.org/journal-forensic-sciences |date=23 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Canadian Society of Forensic Science]] (founded 1953), publishers of the ''[[Journal of the Canadian Society of Forensic Science]]''; the British Academy of Forensic Sciences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafs.org.uk/cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi/|title=The British Academy of Forensic Sciences|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627092734/http://www.bafs.org.uk/cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi/|archivedate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (founded 1960), publishers of ''[[Medicine, Science and the Law]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafs.org.uk/cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi/journal|title=Medicine, Science and the Law|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627111139/http://www.bafs.org.uk/cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi/journal|archivedate=27 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Australian Academy of Forensic Sciences]] (founded 1967), publishers of the ''Australian Journal of Forensic Sciences''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''[http://www.isasi.org/Documents/Hawkins%20-%20Using%20a%20drone%20and%20photogrammetry%20software%20V4%20(PAPER).pdf Using a Drone and Photogrammetry Software to Create Orthomosaic Images and 3D Models of Aircraft Accident Sites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113120441/http://www.isasi.org/Documents/Hawkins%20-%20Using%20a%20drone%20and%20photogrammetry%20software%20V4%20(PAPER).pdf |date=13 January 2017 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st century ===
In the past decade, documenting forensics scenes has become more efficient. People started using laser scanners, drones and photogrammetry to obtain 3D point clouds of accidents or crime scenes. Reconstruction of an accident scene on a highway using drones involves data acquisition time of only 10–20 minutes and can be performed without shutting down traffic.The results are not just accurate, in centimeters, for measurement to be presented  in court but also easy to digitally preserve in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.isasi.org/Documents/Hawkins%20-%20Using%20a%20drone%20and%20photogrammetry%20software%20V4%20(PAPER).pdf|title=Using a Drone and Photogrammetry Software to Create Orthomosaic Images and 3D Models of Aircraft Accident Sites|last=Hawkins|first=Stuart|date=November 2016|work=UK AAIB|access-date=4 February 2017|via=International Society of Air Safety Investigators|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113120441/http://www.isasi.org/Documents/Hawkins%20-%20Using%20a%20drone%20and%20photogrammetry%20software%20V4%20(PAPER).pdf|archivedate=13 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Questionable techniques ==
Some forensic techniques, believed to be scientifically sound at the time they were used, have turned out later to have much less scientific merit or none.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Annual Review of Law and Social Science |volume=4 |pages=149–171 |doi=10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.4.110707.172303 |first1=Michael J. |last1=Saks |first2=David L. |last2=Faigman |year=2008 |title= Failed forensics: how forensic science lost its way and how it might yet find it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some such techniques include:

Real-life crime scene investigators and forensic scientists warn that popular television shows do not give a realistic picture of the work and often wildlly distorting the nature of the work, and exaggerating the ease, speed, effectiveness, drama, glamour, influence and comfort level of their jobs—which they describe as far more mundane, tedious and boring.&lt;ref name="how_accurate_are_crime_shows_2017_02_07_rasumssen_edu"&gt;Flavin, Brianna (quoting Brian McKenna, retired police Lieutenant and Crime Scene Investigator), [http://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/justice-studies/blog/crime-show-myths-debunked-forensic-experts-tell-what-life-is-real/ "How Accurate are Crime Shows on TV?

Some claim these modern TV shows have changed individuals' expectations of forensic science, sometimes unrealistically—an influence termed the "[[CSI effect]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Holmgren| first = Janne A.

Further, research has suggested that public misperceptions about criminal forensics can create, in the mind of a [[juror]], unrealistic expectations of forensic evidence—which they expect to see before convicting—implicitly biasing the juror towards the defendant. Citing the "CSI Effect," at least one researcher has suggested screening jurors for their level of influence from such TV programs&lt;ref name="csi_effect_and_juror_decisions_2015_alldredge" /&gt;

==Controversies==
Questions about certain areas of forensic science, such as fingerprint evidence and the assumptions behind these disciplines have been brought to light in some publications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=18 February 2009| title='Badly Fragmented' Forensic Science System Needs Overhaul| publisher=The National Academies| url=http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12589| accessdate=2009-03-09| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826234749/http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12589| archivedate=26 August 2009| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=18 February 2009| title=National Academy of Sciences Finds 'Serious Deficiencies' in Nation's Crime Labs| publisher=National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers| url=http://www.nacdl.org/public.nsf/newsreleases/2009mn06?OpenDocument| accessdate=2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the ''New York Post''.&lt;ref name=ForensicChallenge&gt;{{cite web| date=6 March 2009| title=CSI: Without a clue; A new report forces Police and Judges to rethink forensic science| author=Katherine Ramsland| work=[[The New York Post]], PostScript| url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/03072009/postopinion/opedcolumnists/csi__without_a_clue_158464.htm| accessdate=2009-03-07| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310062628/http://www.nypost.com/seven/03072009/postopinion/opedcolumnists/csi__without_a_clue_158464.htm| archivedate=10 March 2009| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article stated that "No one has proved even the basic assumption: That everyone's fingerprint is unique."&lt;ref name=ForensicChallenge /&gt; The article also stated that "Now such assumptions are being questioned – and with it may come a radical change in how forensic science is used by police departments and prosecutors."&lt;ref name=ForensicChallenge /&gt; Law professor Jessica Gabel said on NOVA that forensic science "lacks the rigors, the standards, the quality controls and procedures that we find, usually, in science."&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Gabel, lawyer and lecturer from NOVA [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/forensics-on-trial.html "Forensics on Trial"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627214550/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/forensics-on-trial.html |date=27 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, on 25 June 2009, the Supreme Court issued a 5-to-4 decision in ''[[Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts]]'' stating that crime laboratory reports may not be used against criminal defendants at trial unless the analysts responsible for creating them give testimony and subject themselves to cross-examination.  The Supreme Court cited the National Academies report ''Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12589 |title=Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward |publisher=Nap.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527111020/http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12589 |archivedate=27 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in their decision. Writing for the majority, Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] referred to the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] report in his assertion that "Forensic evidence is not uniquely immune from the risk of manipulation."

In 2009, scientists indicated that it is possible to fabricate DNA evidence, therefore suggesting it is possible to falsely accuse or acquit a person or persons using forged evidence.&lt;ref name=Pollack /&gt;

In America, another area of forensic science that has come under question in recent years is the lack of laws requiring the accreditation of forensic labs.  Some states require accreditation, but some states do not.  Because of this, many labs have been caught performing very poor work resulting in false convictions or acquittals.  For example, it was discovered after an audit of the Houston Police Department in 2002 that the lab had fabricated evidence which led George Rodriguez being convicted of raping a fourteen-year-old girl.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/05/us/new-doubt-cast-on-testing-in-houston-police-crime-lab.html|title = New Doubt Cast on Testing in Houston Police Crime Lab|date = 5 August 2004|accessdate = 24 October 2014|website = |publisher = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141031000519/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/05/us/new-doubt-cast-on-testing-in-houston-police-crime-lab.html|archivedate = 31 October 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The former director of the lab, when asked, said that the total number of cases that could have been contaminated by improper work could be in the range of 5,000 to 10,000.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;  This could have been avoided if the lab had been accredited by organizations such as ASCLD/Lab, which require crime labs to undergo rigorous assessments to show that they are able to perform multiple tests accurately.  Once they become accredited, they are periodically re-evaluated to ensure that the lab is still functioning at its best.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ascld-lab.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Why-become-an-acredited-lab.pdf|title = Why become an Accredited Laboratory?|date = |accessdate = 20 October 2014|website = American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors / Laboratory Accreditation Board|publisher = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141025053645/http://www.ascld-lab.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Why-become-an-acredited-lab.pdf|archivedate = 25 October 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Periodic evaluations of a lab's performance by an independent organization will help to prevent scandals from occurring in forensic science laboratories.

Although forensic science has greatly enhanced the investigator's ability to solve crimes, it has limitations and must be scrutinized in and out of the courtroom to avoid the occurrence of wrongful convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date=21 August 2012| title=How body parts evidence gets from crime scene to courtroom| author=Fabiola Carletti| publisher=[[CBC News]], PostScript| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/08/20/f-body-parts-investigation-breakdown.html| accessdate=2012-08-21| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821205039/http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/08/20/f-body-parts-investigation-breakdown.html| archivedate=21 August 2012| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies have discovered a difference in rape related injury reporting based on race, with white victims reporting a higher frequency of injuries than black victims.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Baker RB, Fargo JD, Shambley-Ebron D, Sommers MS. A source of healthcare disparity: Race, skin color, and injuries after rape among adolescents and young adults. Journal of Forensic Nursing, 2010; 6: 144-150&lt;/ref&gt; However, since current forensic examination techniques may not be sensitive to all injuries across a range of skin colors, more research needs to be conducted to understand if this trend is due to skin confounding healthcare providers when examining injuries or if darker skin extends a protective element.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In clinical practice, for patients with darker skin, one study recommends that attention must be paid to the thighs, labia majora, posterior fourchette and fossa navicularis, so that no rape related injuries are missed upon close examination.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Forensic science and humanitarian work ==
The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) uses forensic science for humanitarian purposes to clarify the fate of missing persons after armed conflict, disasters or migration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/what-we-do/forensic/index.jsp |title=Forensic science and humanitarian action |publisher=ICRC |date= |accessdate=2014-08-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707145212/http://www.icrc.org/eng/what-we-do/forensic/index.jsp |archivedate=7 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the services related to [[Restoring Family Links]] and Missing Persons. Knowing what has happened to a missing relative can often make it easier to proceed with the grieving process and move on with life for families of missing persons.

Forensic science is used by various other organizations to clarify the fate and whereabouts of persons who have gone missing. Examples include the NGO [[Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team]], working to clarify the fate of people who disappeared during the period of the 1976–1983 military dictatorship. The [[International Commission on Missing Persons]] (ICMP) uses forensic science to find missing persons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Forensic archeology and anthropology |url=http://www.ic-mp.org/activities/technical-assistance/?page_id=539 |title=Forensic archeology and anthropology |publisher=Ic-mp.org |date=28 February 2012 |accessdate=2014-08-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140624073824/http://www.ic-mp.org/activities/technical-assistance/?page_id=539 |archivedate=24 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example after the conflicts in the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ic-mp.org/icmp-worldwide/southeast-europe/ |title=Southeast Europe |publisher=Ic-mp.org |date=28 February 2012 |accessdate=2014-08-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813081559/http://www.ic-mp.org/icmp-worldwide/southeast-europe/ |archivedate=13 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognising the role of forensic science for humanitarian purposes, as well as the importance of forensic investigations in fulfilling the state's responsibilities to investigate human rights violations, a group of experts in the late-1980's devised a UN Manual on the Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, which became known as the [[Minnesota Protocol]]. This document was revised and re-published by the [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Executions/MinnesotaProtocolInvestigationPotentiallyUnlawfulDeath2016.pdf |title=Minnesota Protocol on the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death (2016) |accessdate=2017-06-30 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{judaism}}
'''Goel''' ''(the Go’el HaDahm)'' is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term which comes from the word ''lig'ol'' ("to redeem"), hence meaning "redeemer", which in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[rabbinic Judaism|rabbinical]] tradition denotes a person who as the nearest relative of another is charged with the duty of restoring the rights of another and avenging his wrongs. When ''goel'' is used in contexts involving revenge for wrongful death, [[English translations of the bible|English-language translations of the Bible]] generally refer to a goel as an "avenger of blood".&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/joshua/20-5.htm Joshua 20:5]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Book of Isaiah]], God is called the redeemer of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-14.htm Isaiah 41:14] and elsewhere in Isaiah&lt;/ref&gt; as God redeems his people from captivity; the context shows that the redemption also involves moving on to something greater. In [[Christianity]], the title goel is applied to [[Christ]], who redeems his believers from all evil by offering Himself as the Paschal Lamb.

==Duties of the goel==
[[Image:Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld- Ruth im Feld des Boaz.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld]]: ''Ruth in Boaz's Field'', 1828. The [[Book of Ruth]] tells the story of Ruth and her mother-in-law Naomi. After her husband's death they both move to Naomi's native land, where she is redeemed from poverty and widowhood through Ruth by her goel, Boaz.]] The obligations of the goel include the duty to redeem the relative from [[Slavery in antiquity#Old Testament or Tanakh|slavery]], if the latter had been obliged to sell himself into serfdom (Leviticus 25: 48-49); to repurchase the property of a relative who had had to sell it because of poverty; to avenge the blood of his relative; to [[Yibbum|marry his brother's widow]] in order to have a son for his brother, in case the brother had not got any son to pass his name forth (Deuteronomy 25:5-6); and to receive the restitution if the injured relative had died (Numbers 5:8).

{{bibleverse||Numbers|35:9-30|NKJV}} regulates the duties of the goel. The congregation has to judge the case before it puts a murderer in the hands of a goel. More than one witness is needed for conviction. In case of accidental manslaughter, the slayer can save his life by fleeing to a "[[Cities of Refuge|city of refuge]]" and staying there for the term of the [[Kohen gadol|high priest]] (who is appointed for his lifetime). Ransom is not accepted for murder. Revenge cannot be taken on the offender's children or parents (Deuteronomy 24:16). Leviticus 25:48-49 gives the order in which the nearest relative is considered the goel in the case of redeeming a slave: brother, uncle, male cousin and then other relatives. The same order was probably observed in the other cases, except in marrying a sister-in-law.

==Post-biblical tradition==
Jewish tradition has also ascribed to the blood avenger role performed in modern times by a [[prosecuting attorney]], who thus pleads on behalf of the victim the case against the criminal. Thus, he is responsible for bringing the offender to court, finding evidence against him, presenting the case to the court, and collecting damages from the offender. It is also his task to argue against any attempts to pardon the sinner. It is presumed that the court would be the party who would avenge the wrongful death via the usage of the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Itamar Varhaftig: ''Techumin,'' volume 11, page 326. Referred by Rabbi Uri Dasberg: [http://www.ou.org/torah/zomet/5758/vayishlach58.htm#article5 Torah and Law: Blood Vengeance] ''Shabbat-Zomet,'' December 13, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Incorporation (Inc.)''' is the formation of a new corporation (a corporation being a legal entity that is effectively [[corporate personhood|recognized as a person under the law]]). The corporation may be a [[business]], a [[nonprofit organization]], [[sports club]], or a [[government]] of a new [[city]] or [[town]]. This article focuses on the process of incorporation; see also [[corporation|Corporation]] (Corp.).

==USA==

===Certificate of Inc. (requirements)===
The information required differ in different states. However, there are some common information that are asked by almost all the states and so, must be incl. in the Certificate of Inc., accordingly. They are as follows:
*'''Business purpose''' – It would describe the incorporated tasks a Company (Co.) has to do or provide. At present, only two types of business purpose clauses are used. They are:

# General – General purpose clauses are accepted by some and not all states. It indicates that the budding company has been formed to carry out "all lawful business" in the region.
# Specific – Alternatively, some states have made it mandatory for the business owners to furnish a more detailed explanation of the products and/or services to be offered by their Co..

*'''Corp. name''' – A chosen name must be added to the Certificate of Inc.. This should be followed with the corporate identifier such as "Corp.", "Inc.", "Co.". A preliminary name availability search is advisable, prior to the submission of the Articles of Inc.. In case of online incorporation, the state will have final say with regards to the name chosen for the company and that the name shouldn't deceive or mislead the consumers.
*'''Regd. agent''' – Almost all the states require every corporation to have a registered agent of their own in the state of incorporation. Registered (Regd.) agents will receive all the important legal as well as tax documents on behalf of the corporation. A typical regd. agent will need a physical address (PO box nos.) in the state of incorporation and should be accessible during normal business hours.
*'''Inc.''' – An Inc. is the person who prepares and files the Certificate of Inc. with the concerned state.
*'''Share par value''' – It refers to the stated minimum value, and generally doesn't correspond to the actual value. Usually, $00.01, $01.00 or no par are some of the common par values. In reality, the value of a share is based on its fair market value, or whatever amount a buyer is willing to pay for the same.
*'''Nr. of authorized shares of stock''' – An Inc. needs to stipulate the exact number of shares they as a company are willing to authorize. Moreover, it is mandatory for every Corp., be it small or large, to have stock. A stock represents ownership in the corporation.
*'''Directors''' – Many states need the name and addresses of the initial directors of the corporation in the incorporation papers. They are responsible for the corporation's daily affairs and oversee major corporate decisions. Directors hold an [[elected office]] as chosen by the shareholders' mandate and will be responsible to appoint officers.
*'''Preferred shares''' – If a Co./Corp. is willing to permit both [[preferred stock|preferred]] as well as [[common stock|common shares]] of stock, then this should have a mention in the Articles of Incorporation, along with the voting rights information. Generally, preferred shares provide its shareholders preferential payments of distribution of assets or dividends, in case the company shuts down its operations. A lot of small business owners only allow shares of common stock. 
*'''Officers''' – Officers include president, vice president, secretary and treasurer have the responsibility towards the daily activities of the Corp.. Certain states require that officer information be included, while others have kept it optional.
*'''Legal address of the Co./Corp.''' – In many states, it is optional to provide the legal or principal business address. But in some states it is mandatory.

===Legal benefits===
*'''Protection of personal assets''' – One of the most important legal benefits is the safeguarding of personal assets against the claims of creditors and lawsuits. Sole proprietors and general partners in a [[partnership]] are personally and jointly responsible for all the [[legal liability|Legal Liability]] (LL) of a business such as loans, accounts payable, and legal judgments. In a corporation, however, [[stockholders]], [[board of directors|directors]] and [[Chief executive officer|officers]] typically are not liable for the company's debts and obligations. They are limited in liability to the amount they have invested in the corporation. For example, if a shareholder purchased $100 in stock, no more than $100.00 can be lost. Corporation (Corp.) and [[limited liability company|Limited Liability Company]] (LLC) may hold assets such as real estate, cars or boats. If a shareholder of a corporation is personally involved in a lawsuit or [[bankruptcy]], these assets may be protected. A creditor of a shareholder of a Corp. or LLC cannot seize the assets of the company. However, the creditor can seize ownership shares in the corporation, as they are considered a personal asset.
*'''Transferable ownership''' – Ownership in a Corp. or LLC is easily transferable to others, either in whole or in part. Some state laws are particularly corporate-friendly. For example, the transfer of ownership in a corporation incorporated in [[Delaware corporation|US-DE]] is not required to be filed or recorded. 
*'''Retirement funds''' – Retirement funds and qualified retirements plans, such as a [[401(k)]], may be established more easily.
*'''Taxation''' – In USA, Corp. are [[tax]]ed at a lower rate than individuals are. Also, they can own shares in other corporations and receive corporate dividends 80% tax-free. There are no limits on the amount of losses a corporation may carry forward to subsequent tax years. A sole proprietorship, on the other hand, cannot claim a capital loss greater than $3,000.00 unless the owner has offsetting capital gains.
*'''Raising funds through sale of stock'''. A Corp. can easily raise capital from investors through the sale of stock.
*'''Durability''' – A corporation is capable of continuing indefinitely. Its existence is not affected by the death of shareholders, directors, or officers of the corporation.
*'''Credit rating''' – Regardless of an owner's personal [[credit score]]s, a corporation can acquire its own [[credit rating]], and build a separate credit history by applying for and using corporate credit.

===Legal history===
Am. opinion of corporations has evolved significantly throughout history, and [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] cases provide a means to observe this evolution. While these cases may seem arbitrary and decontextualized when examined individually, when viewed successively and within historical context, a narrative emerges that offers an explanation for why such views are upheld.

====''Dartmouth College v. Woodward'', 1819====
1816 the [[New Hampshire]] state legislature passed a bill that would turn privately owned [[Dartmouth College]] into a publicly owned university with a Board of Trustees appointed by the governor.&lt;ref&gt;''Dartmouth College v. Woodward'', 1819&lt;/ref&gt; The board filed a suit challenging the constitutionality of the legislature. The suit alleged the college enjoyed the right to contract and the government changing that contract was not allowed. Chief Justice John Marshall delivered the majority opinion and affirmed that the right to contract exists between owners of private property rather than between a government and its citizens. The case was the first case in US history that asked fundamental questions about corporate entities and the protections they enjoy; it also was a precedent-setting case in extending "individual rights" to corporations.

====''Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad'', 1886====
The railroad was an expensive multi-year project that greatly changed and altered both the physical and commercial landscape of the country. As with most new technology developments that have a broad impact, there are disputes about how those technologies and the businesses they thrive in fit under the umbrella of laws that govern regulations and taxation. In 1886 one such taxation dispute arose between [[Santa Clara County]] and [[Southern Pacific Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;''Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad'', 1886&lt;/ref&gt; The railroad thought the tax code was misapplied to some of their property and assets. In deciding the case, a unanimous court ruled that governments must abide by the same tax code enforcement for individuals that it did for corporations. While not explicitly stated in the case, it was implied that this case extended equal protection rights to corporations under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th amendment]].

====''Liggett v. Lee'', 1933====
The booming economy the railroad corporations helped build from the late 19th into the early 20th centuries came to a screeching halt in 1929. [[The Great Depression]], as it came to be known, helped a view of corporations emerge that put them at odds with the normal working man. The election of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was a manifestation of many populist sentiments the country might have felt. In 1933 a [[Florida]] case came before the court, again disputing taxation.&lt;ref&gt;''Liggett v. Lee'', 1933&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Louis K. Liggett Co. v. Lee|''Liggett v. Lee'']] the court ruled that there could be a corporate tax, essentially saying the structure of business was a justifiably discriminatory criterion for governments to consider when writing tax legislation. This was a unique ruling handed down during a unique time in US history that denied a corporation freedom it sought in the courtroom.

====''First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti'', 1978====
From 1940 to 1990 the percent of total [[GDP]] made up by financial service professionals increased by 300%.&lt;ref&gt;Cracks in the Pipeline Part One: Restoring Efficiency to Wall Street and Value to Main Street&lt;/ref&gt; Along with that growth there was a growth in the profits this industry experienced as well. As the disposable income of banks and other financial institutions rose, they sought a way to use it to influence politics and policy. In response, [[Massachusetts]] passed a law limiting corporate donations strictly to issues related to their industry.&lt;ref&gt;''Bank of Boston v. Belloti'', 1978&lt;/ref&gt; The [[First National Bank of Boston]] challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and won. ''[[First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti]]'' allowed business to use financial speech in political causes of any nature.

====''Citizens United v. FEC'', 2010====
In 2010 amidst an outpouring of frustration and blame directed at [[Wall Street]] the issue of corporate contributions came before the court again.&lt;ref&gt;''Citizens United v. FEC'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'' the court said there was virtually no distinction between monetary contributions and political speech, and because we do not limit political speech unless it is tantamount to bribery, corporations have the right as people to donate unlimited amounts of money to any political cause so long as it is not to a direct campaign.

===Steps required for incorporation===
The '''[[articles of incorporation]]''' (also called a [[charter]], [[certificate of incorporation]] or [[letters patent]]) are filed with the appropriate state office, listing the purpose of the corporation, its principal place of business and the number and type of shares of stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawserver.com/maps/state-corporation-departments |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211035539/https://www.lawserver.com/maps/state-corporation-departments|title=State Corporation Departments: Interactive Map :: LawServer|archivedate=2013-02-11|date=2013-02-11|access-date=2017-11-01||work=LawServer}}&lt;/ref&gt; A registration fee is due, which is usually between $25 and $1,000, depending on the state.

A corporate name is generally made up of three parts: "distinctive element", "descriptive element", and a legal ending. All corporations must have a distinctive element, and in most filing jurisdictions, a legal ending to their names. Some corporations choose not to have a descriptive element. In the name "Tiger Computers, Inc.", the word "Tiger" is the distinctive element; the word "Computers" is the descriptive element; and the "Inc." is the legal ending. The legal ending indicates that it is in fact a [[legal corporation]] and not just a [[business License|business registration]] or [[partnership]]. Incorporated, [[limited company|limited]], and corporation, or their respective abbreviations (Inc., Ltd., Corp.) are the possible legal endings in the US.

Usually, there are also '''[[bylaw|corporate bylaws]]''' which must be filed with the state. Bylaws outline a number of important administrative details such as when annual shareholder meetings will be held, who can vote and the manner in which shareholders will be notified if there is need for an additional "special" meeting.

===Taxation===
{{Main article|Corporate tax in the United States}}
Corporations can only deduct net operating losses going back two years and forward 20 years.

===Reporting after incorporation===
Assuming a corporation has not sold [[stock]] to the public, conducting corporate business is straightforward. Often, it amounts to recording key corporate decisions (for example, borrowing money or buying real estate) and holding an annual meeting. These formalities can often be supplanted by written agreement and do not usually need a face-to-face meeting.

==In the United Kingdom==
{{Main article|Company formation}}
In the UK, the process of incorporation is generally called company formation. The United Kingdom is one of the quickest locations to incorporate, with a fully electronic process and a very fast turnaround by the national registrar of companies, the [[Companies House]]. The current [[Companies House]] record is five minutes to vet and issue a [[certificate of incorporation]] for an electronic application.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Types of companies===
There are many different types of UK companies:

* [[Public limited company]] (PLC)
* [[Private company limited by shares]] (Ltd.)
* [[Company limited by guarantee]]
* [[Unlimited company]] (Unltd.)
* [[Limited liability partnership]] (LLP)
* [[Community interest company]]
* [[Industrial and provident society]] (IPS)
* [[Royal charter]] (RC)

==International perspective==
{{See also|Types of business entity}}
The legal concept of incorporation is recognized all over the world.

* In the United States, there are many ways that a corporation can be identified. The four forms that are valid in all 50 states and the District of Columbia are "Corporation", "Incorporated", and the abbreviations "Corp." and "Inc." Some states allow the use of "Company" and some have additional optional names. A complete list of which names are allowed in each state can be found at [[Types of business entity#United States]].
* In [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]], the [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]] ("Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung", meaning "limited liability business association"), as well as the [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]] ("Aktiengesellschaft", meaning "business association with shares"), are the entities most similar to the corporations in the US.
* In the [[United Kingdom]], with the exception of an [[unlimited company]] or corporation which requires no designation as part of its legal company name, the titles [[Limited company|Ltd.]] (limited company) or [[Public limited company|plc]] (public limited company) are used for corporations.
* In [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]], the term "[[Sàrl|SARL]] ({{fr}}), (société à responsibilité limitée, company with limited liability)" or [[S.A. (corporation)|SA]] (société anonyme, anonymous corporation) or [[Société par actions simplifiée|SAS]] (Société par actions simplifiée, simplified anonymous joint-stock corporation) is used.
* [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]] and [[Latin America]] use the title [[S.A. (corporation)|SA]] (anonymous partnership) for stock corporations or Ltda (limitada or limited liability) for limited companies.

(Spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością, a partnership with limited liability) for limited companies. There is also Spółka komandytowa (Sp. K.), a partnership where at least one partner is fully liable and other one has limited liability, and Spółka komandytowo-akcyjna (Sp. K. A.){{snd}} a partnership where at least one partner is fully liable and other one is a stock shareholder not being liable.
* [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] use the title A/S for stock corporations ({{lang-da|Aktieselskab}}, {{lang-no|Aksjeselskap}}), while Sweden uses the similar AB ({{lang-sv|aktiebolag}}). [[Finland]] uses Oy ({{lang-fi|Osakeyhtiö}}), Oyj for stock corporations (Osakeyhtiö, julkinen) and Ay (Avoin yhtiö) or Ky (Kommandiittiyhtiö) for private enterprises.
* In [[India]], the term [[Pvt Ltd]] is used for a company that is private, an entity similar to an [[limited liability company|LLC]] in the United States. [[Limited company|Ltd]] is used for [[Publicly listed company|publicly listed companies]] (shares of a listed company are traded on the stock market) or a public [[corporation]], a similar entity to a corporation in the US.

* In the [[Netherlands]], [[Naamloze vennootschap|N.V.]] (''Naamloze Vennootschap'') and [[Besloten vennootschap|B.V.]] (''Besloten Vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid'') are used. In [[Belgium]], the abbreviations NV and Bvba are used for similar types of entity.
* [[Malaysia]] uses Sdn. Bhd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.companies.com.my companies.com.my]/&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ms|Sendirian Berhad}}), meaning "private limited", which is the equivalent of an incorporated entity in the US.
* [[Indonesia]] uses P.T. ({{lang-id|Perseroan Terbatas}}), meaning "private limited", which is the equivalent of an incorporated entity in the US. This legal title is stated in front of the corporation name. If the shares become publicly listed for trading in stock exchange, it is called Tbk. ({{lang-id|Terbuka}}), appended after the corporation name.
* [[Slovakia]] and the [[Czech Republic]] use s.r.o. ({{lang-sk|spoločnosť s ručením obmedzeným}}, {{lang-cz|společnost s ručením omezeným}} meaning “business with limited liability”) and a.s. ({{lang-sk|akciová spoločnosť}}, {{lang-cz|akciová společnost}} meaning “business with shares”).
* In [[Latvia]], the most commonly used title of a corporation is "S.I.A." ({{lang-lv|Sabiedrība ar Ierobežotu Atbildību}}) for "limited liability company", or "LLC", and "A/S" ({{lang-lv|Akciju Sabiedrība}}) for "joint stock company", or "JSC". The title "S.I.A." and "A/S" are put before the name of the corporation. [[Lithuania]] uses "UAB" ({{lang-lt|Uždaroji Akcinė Bendrovė}}) for "limited liability company" and "AB" ({{lang-lt|Akcinė Bendrovė}}) for "joint stock company", and, like in Latvia, they also appear before the corporation's name.

: Sole proprietorship (person fizik) – A business owned and managed by one individual who is personally liable for all business debts and obligations.
: Limited liability company (LLC) – A hybrid legal structure that provides the limited liability features of a corporation and the tax efficiencies and operational flexibility of a partnership.
: Corporation – A legal entity owned by shareholders.
: Non-profit – An organization engaged in activities of public or private interest where making a profit is not a primary mission. Some non-profits are exempt from federal taxes.
* [[Singapore]] uses Pte. Ltd., meaning "private limited", which is the equivalent of an incorporated entity in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/private-limited-company.html/ |title=Details on Private Limited Company |publisher=Businessdictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[China]] uses WFOE (or WOFE), to refer to a Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise (WFOE). This is the most popular form of business entity for foreign investors wanting to set up a company in China; it is a limited liability company.
* In [[Canada]], the process of incorporation can be done either at the federal or provincial level. Companies which incorporate with the federal government will generally need to register extra-provincially in the province that they elect to do business. Similarly, a provincial corporation may need to register extra-provincially if they are to have offices outside of their home province. Incorporations are effected quite quickly, depending upon the jurisdiction of registration, as several provinces and the federal government have started to allow for electronic filing. Incorporated Canadian companies can generally use either Limited, Incorporated or Corporation in their name, but this may vary from province to province.
* [[Dubai]] uses "LLC" to denote a limited liability company. Listed companies use "PJSC" to denote a public joint stock company.
* In [[Turkey]], Ltd. Şti. (which stands for ''Limited Şirketi'') is a common form to denote limited liability companies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2304">In the practice of [[law]], '''judicial estoppel''' (also known as '''estoppel by inconsistent positions''') is an [[estoppel]] that precludes a [[Party (law)|party]] from taking a position in a case that is contrary to a position it has taken in earlier legal proceedings. Although, in the [[United States]], it is only a part of [[common law]] and therefore not sharply defined, it is generally agreed that it can only be cited if the party in question successfully maintained its position in the earlier proceedings and benefited from it.

Judicial estoppel is a doctrine that may apply in matters involving closed bankruptcies, wherein the former debtor attempts to lay claim to an asset that was not disclosed on the bankruptcy schedules. In an early U.S. articulation of the doctrine, the United States Supreme Court, in [https://web.archive.org/web/20141128024630/https://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/196/196.US.115.73.html ''First National Bank of Jacksboro v. Lasater'', 196 U.S. 115 (1905)], held at 119: 
:"It cannot be that a bankrupt, by omitting to schedule and withholding from his trustee all knowledge of certain property, can, after his estate in bankruptcy has been finally closed up, immediately thereafter assert title to the property on the ground that the trustee had never taken any action in respect to it. If the claim was of value (as certainly this claim was, according to the judgment below), it was something to which the creditors were entitled, and this bankrupt could not, by withholding knowledge of its existence, obtain a release from his debts and still assert title to the property." 

The principle was used in 2001 by a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court in the [[Piscataqua River border dispute]], in which New Hampshire argued that the [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]] was in New Hampshire after having previously joined a [[consent decree]] that agreed on a border that would put it in Maine.

In the law of [[inheritance]], a '''laughing heir''' is an [[heir]] who is legally entitled to inherit the property of a person who has died, even though that heir is only distantly related to the deceased, and therefore has no personal connection or reason to feel [[Grief|bereaved]] over the death.

In most [[jurisdiction]]s, the law of [[intestacy]] requires that the property of a person who died without leaving a [[Will (law)|will]] must first go to that person's immediate family, such as a spouse, descendants, ascendants, or persons descended from the same parents or grandparents.  Under the [[common law]], if no such persons exist, the property passes to the nearest living person who can demonstrate some degree of kinship with the deceased, no matter how distant the relation.

Some jurisdictions have a '''laughing heir statute''', which cuts off the right of inheritance when the remaining relatives become too remote. In such jurisdictions, if no relative falls within the limitation set by the statute, then the property [[escheat]]s to the state. §2-103 of the [[Uniform Probate Code]], which has been adopted by a number of states, sets the outer limits of the right to inheritance with [[grandparent]]s, [[aunt]]s and uncles, and [[first cousin]]s. Under the code, heirs that are farther removed from the deceased are left with no claim to the estate at all.

By contrast, some US states (such as [[Virginia]]) have extended the principle to cover the family of a predeceased ''spouse''. In those states, if the decedent had been married, and their spouse had died before the decedent, and if the decedent had no blood relatives at all, then the decedent's property would pass to any living relatives of the ''spouse'', no matter how remote.

The '''Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS)''' is the current tax depreciation system in the United States.  Under this system, the capitalized cost (basis) of tangible property is recovered over a specified life by annual deductions for depreciation.  The lives are specified broadly in the [[Internal Revenue Code]].  The [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) publishes detailed tables of lives by classes of assets.    The deduction for depreciation is computed under one of two methods (declining balance switching to straight line or [[Depreciation#Straight-line depreciation|straight line]]) at the election of the taxpayer, with limitations.&lt;ref&gt;Note that under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/179- 26 USC 179], taxpayers may elect to claim a deduction for the full basis of certain amounts of property placed in service during the taxable year, subject to limitations.  This election supersedes MACRS deductions for the basis so deducted.&lt;/ref&gt;  See [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p946.pdf IRS Publication 946] for a 120-page guide to MACRS.

==History==
Tax deductions for depreciation have been allowed in the U.S. since the inception of the income tax.  Prior to 1971, these deductions could be computed in a variety of manners over a wide range of lives, under old Bulletin F.  In 1971, Congress introduced the Class Life Asset Depreciation Range (ADR) system in an attempt to simplify calculations and provide some uniformity.  Under ADR, the IRS prescribed lives for classes of assets based on the nature or use of the asset.  Such classes included general classes (such as office equipment) and industry classes (such as assets used in the manufacture of rubber goods).  Taxpayers could use their choice of several methods of depreciating assets, including straight line, declining balance, and sum of years digits.  Asset costs and accumulated depreciation were tracked by "vintage accounts" consisting of all assets within a class acquired in a particular tax year.  All vintage accounts for the same year were assumed placed in service in the middle of the year; however, a taxpayer could elect the modified half year convention with potentially favorable results.

In 1981, Congress again changed the depreciation system,&lt;ref&gt;[[Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981]].&lt;/ref&gt; providing generally for shorter lives for recovery of costs.  Under the Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS), broad groups of assets were assigned based on the old ADR lives (which the IRS has updated since).  Taxpayers were permitted to calculate depreciation only under the declining balance method switching to straight line or the straight line method.  Other changes applied as well.

The present MACRS system&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/168- 26 USC 168]; [http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:2.0.1.1.1.0.8.372&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.168(a)-1, et seq.]&lt;/ref&gt; was adopted as part of the [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]].

California is the only state which does not fully conform its depreciation schedule to MACRS.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Robyn. [http://taxfoundation.org/sites/taxfoundation.org/files/docs/2012_tax_foundation_index_bp62.pdf 2012 State Business Tax Climate Index]. Tax Foundation. January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depreciable lives by class==
Under MACRS a taxpayer must compute [[tax deductions]] for [[depreciation]] of [[tangible property]] using specified lives and methods.  Assets are divided into classes by type of asset or by business in which the asset is used.  (See tables of classes below.)  Where a general class based on the nature of the asset applies (00.xx classes below), that class takes precedence over the use class.

For each class, three lives are specified:  one for regular depreciation (GDS in the tables below), one for the alternative depreciation system (ADS), and a class life.  Taxpayers may be required to use ADS or otherwise may elect which of the three lives to use.  Lives for personal property vary from 3 years to 20 years.  Land improvements must be depreciated over 15 or 20 years.  Other real property must be depreciated over 27.5 years for residential property, 39 years for business property, and 40 years under ADS.

In addition, shorter lives are provided for certain property, including computers and peripheral equipment, certain high technology equipment, special purpose agricultural structures, and certain other items.  MACRS also excluded certain property in regulated industries, as well as films, video tapes, and sound recordings, and certain other items.  Also, leasehold improvements to realty are generally treated as real property under MACRS.

==Depreciation methods==
Only the declining balance method and straight line method of computing depreciation are allowed under MACRS.  Taxpayers using the declining balance change to the straight line method at the point at which depreciation deductions are optimized.  See the tables below.  All tangible personal property acquired during the year is considered placed in service in the middle of the tax year ("[[half-year convention]]").  Real property is considered placed in service in the middle of the month in which acquired ("mid-month convention").  Special rules apply for pro rating deductions for short tax years and for the first year of business, or where more than 40% of tangible personal property additions are in the final quarter of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:2.0.1.1.1.0.8.375&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.168(d)-1].&lt;/ref&gt;

The method and life used in depreciating an asset is an accounting method, change of which requires IRS approval.&lt;ref&gt;See IRS [https://www.irs.gov/app/picklist/list/formsInstructions.html?value=3115&amp;criteria=formNumber&amp;submitSearch=Find Form 3115] and instructions.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxpayers may track the basis and accumulated depreciation of assets individually or in vintage accounts, as in the old ADR system.  Where assets are tracked in vintage accounts, a first-in-first-out convention is usually applied to determine basis of assets retired.

==Special allowances and bonus depreciation==&lt;!-- [[Bonus depreciation]] redirects here --&gt;
At various times, additional depreciation deductions have been allowed to encourage investment.  These allowances generally have had limitations.  For example, an additional deduction of 50% of the cost of qualifying property is allowed for certain property acquired after December 31, 2007 and before January 1, 2011&lt;ref&gt;26 USC 168(k), which has been amended numerous times.&lt;/ref&gt;  A nearly identical allowance was available for property acquired after September 10, 2001 and before 2005.  The IRS recently issued guidance clarifying when taxpayers are eligible for 100 percent bonus depreciation.  In addition, the guidance provides procedures for electing 100 percent bonus depreciation and 50 percent bonus depreciation for certain property. In addition to extending the availability of bonus depreciation in general, the Tax Relief Act provided for a new 100 percent depreciation deduction for qualified property that is acquired and placed into service by the taxpayer between September 8, 2010, and January 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=[[McDermott Will &amp; Emery]]|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/irs-clarifies-when-100-percent-bonus-depreciation-applies |title=IRS Clarifies When 100 Percent Bonus Depreciation Applies |publisher=The National Law Review |date= April 21, 2011|accessdate=2012-04-16}} and [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Special rules have also applied for biofuel, recycling, and disaster assistance property.&lt;ref&gt;26 USC 168(l), (m), and (n).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Decoupling modification'' is a tax terminology resulting from the federal tax law enacted March 9, 2002, which created a new tax deduction for "bonus depreciation" that threatened to cost states very large amounts of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ovguide.com/decoupling-modification-9202a8c04000641f8000000013a2d17b |title=Watch Decoupling Modification Video |publisher=Ovguide.com |date=March 9, 2002 |accessdate=November 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal Bonus Depreciation, Section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John M.

==Alternative depreciation system==
Certain assets must be depreciated under the Alternative Depreciation System (ADS), using specified lives and the straight line method.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|26|168|g}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It may be applied at the election of the taxpayer in lieu of regular depreciation,{{sfn|IRS Pub 946|p=32}} and it must be used for the following types of property:{{sfn|IRS Pub 946|p=32}}

:* Listed property used 50% or less in a qualified business use.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|26|168|k|2|D|i|II}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Any tangible property used predominantly outside the United States during the year (subject to certain exceptions).&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|26|168|g|4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Any tax-exempt use property.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|26|168|h}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Any tax-exempt bond-financed property.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|26|168|g|5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* All property used predominantly in a farming business and placed in service in any tax year during which an election not to apply the uniform capitalization rules to certain farming costs is in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCFR|26|1.263A-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Any property imported from a foreign country for which an Executive Order is in effect because the country maintains trade restrictions or engages in other discriminatory acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|26|168|g|6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the ADS must be used for computing depreciation deductions for the [[Alternative Minimum Tax]].  ADS lives are the same as regular depreciation lives for a few classes, but are generally somewhat longer than regular lives for most classes.

==Example==
The following example is extracted from [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p946.pdf IRS Publication 946]:

You bought office furniture (7-year property) for $10,000 and placed it in service on October 13, 2013. You use the furniture only for business.

==Multiple-asset accounts==
A taxpayer may group assets together into a general asset account. The grouped assets must have the same life, method of depreciation, convention, additional first year depreciation percentage, and year (or quarter or month) placed in service. Listed property or vehicles cannot be grouped with other assets. Depreciation for the account is computed as if the entire account were a single asset.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:2.0.1.1.1.0.8.381&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.168(i)-1T]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement of MACRS assets==
Gain or loss may be deferred or recognized on retirement of assets under MACRS, at the taxpayer's election. Under default rules, proceeds from disposing of a depreciable asset in a multiple asset account are recognized as ordinary income, and depreciation on the account is unaffected by the retirement. An optional method allows the asset to be removed from the account at the start of the year from retirement, in which case gain or loss is on the asset is subject to regular rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:2.0.1.1.1.0.8.381&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.168(i)-1T(e)] and [http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:2.0.1.1.1.0.8.388&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.168(i)-8T]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DunmoresProclamation.jpg|thumb|upright|upright=1.15|[[Dunmore's Proclamation]] declaring Martial law in the proclaimed May 27, 1775, several months after the beginning of the [[American Revolutionary War]]]]

'''Martial law''' is the imposition of direct military control of normal civilian functions of government, especially in response to a temporary emergency such as invasion or major disaster, or in an [[military occupation|occupied]] territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/martial_law|title=Martial Law|first=|last=Anonymous|date=19 August 2010|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/martial-law|title=martial law|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martial law can be used by governments to enforce their rule over the public, as seen in multiple countries listed below.. Such incidents may occur after a [[coup d'état]] ([[2006 Thai coup d'état|Thailand in 2006]] and [[2014 Thai coup d'état|2014]], and Egypt in 2013); when threatened by popular protest (China, [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], 2009's [[Iranian Green Movement]] that led to the takeover by Revolutionary Guards); to suppress political opposition (Poland in 1981); or to stabilize insurrections or perceived insurrections (Canada, [[The October Crisis]] of 1970). Martial law may be declared in cases of major natural disasters; however, most countries use a different legal construct, such as a [[state of emergency]].

Martial law has also been imposed during conflicts, and in cases of occupations, where the absence of any other civil government provides for an unstable population. Examples of this form of military rule include post [[World War II]] reconstruction in Germany and Japan, the recovery and reconstruction of the former [[Confederate States of America]] during [[Reconstruction Era]] in the United States of America following the [[American Civil War]], and German occupation of northern France between 1871 and 1873 after the [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]] ended the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. 

Typically, the imposition of martial law accompanies [[curfew]]s; the suspension of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[civil rights]], and [[habeas corpus]]; and the application or extension of [[military law]] or [[military justice]] to civilians. Civilians defying martial law may be subjected to [[military tribunal]] ([[court-martial]]).

==By country==
==={{flag|Australia}}===
The [[Black War]] was a period of violent conflict between British colonists and Aboriginal Australians in Tasmania from the mid-1820s to 1832. With an escalation of violence in the late 1820s, Lieutenant-Governor [[George Arthur]] declared martial law in November 1828—effectively providing legal immunity for killing Aboriginal people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyce|first=James|title=Van Diemen's Land|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tarto-9aKqMC|year=2010|publisher=Black Inc.|isbn=978-1-921825-39-2|page=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=tarto–9aKqMC&amp;pg=PA266 266]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would remain in force for more than three years, the longest period of martial law in Australian history.

Brunei has been under a martial law since a rebellion occurred on 8 December 1962 known as the [[Brunei Revolt]] and was put down by British troops from Singapore. The Sultan of Brunei, [[Hassanal Bolkiah|Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzaddin Waddaulah]], is presently the head of state and also the Minister of Defense and Commander in Chief of Royal Brunei Armed Forces

{{See also|War Measures Act}}

The War Measures Act was a [[Government of Canada]] [[statute]] that allowed the government to assume sweeping emergency powers, stopping short of martial law, i.e. the military does not administer justice, which remains in the hands of the courts. The Act has been invoked three times: During [[World War I]], [[World War II]], and the [[October Crisis of 1970]]. In 1988, the War Measures Act was replaced by the [[Emergencies Act]].

During the [[British Empire|colonial era]], martial law was proclaimed and applied in the territory of the [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Province of Quebec]] during the [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invasion of Canada]] by the army of the American [[Continental Congress]] in 1775–1776. It was also applied twice in the territory of [[Lower Canada]] during the [[Lower Canada Rebellion|1837–1838 insurrections]]. On December 5, following the events of November 1837, martial law was proclaimed in the district of Montréal by Governor [[Archibald Acheson, 2nd Earl of Gosford|Gosford]], without the support of the [[Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada|Legislative Assembly]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada|Parliament of Lower Canada]]. It was imposed until April 27, 1838. Martial law was proclaimed a second time on November 4, 1838, this time by acting Governor [[John Colborne]], and was applied in the district of Montreal until August 24, 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Dubuc.

In Egypt, a [[State of Emergency]] has been in effect almost continuously since 1967. Following the [[Assassination of Anwar El Sadat|assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat]] in 1981, a state of emergency was declared. Egypt has been under state of emergency ever since; the Parliament has renewed the emergency laws every three years since they were imposed.

A State of Emergency gives military courts the power to try civilians and allows the government to detain for renewable 45-day periods and without court orders anyone deemed to be threatening state security. Public demonstrations are banned under the legislation. On 10 February 2011, the ex-president of Egypt, [[Hosni Mubarak]], promised the deletion of the relevant constitutional article that gives legitimacy to State of Emergency in an attempt to please the mass number of protesters that demanded him to resign. On 11 February 2011, the president stepped down and the vice president [[Omar Suleiman]] de facto introduced the country to martial law when transferring all civilian powers from the presidential institution to the military institution. It meant that the presidential executive powers, the parliamentary legislative powers and the judicial powers all transferred directly into the military system which may delegate powers back and forth to any civilian institution within its territory.

The military issued in its third announcement the "end of the State of Emergency as soon as order is restored in Egypt". Before martial law, the Egyptian parliament under the constitution had the civilian power to declare a State of Emergency. When in martial law, the military gained all powers of the state, including to dissolve the parliament and suspend the constitution as it did in its fifth announcement. Under martial law, the only legal framework within the Egyptian territory is the numbered announcements from the military. These announcements could for instance order any civilian laws to come back into force. The military announcements (communiques) are the de facto only current constitution and legal framework for the Egyptian territory. It means that all affairs of the state are bound by the [[Geneva Conventions]].

In 1916 during the [[Easter Rising]], [[Ivor Guest, 1st Viscount Wimborne|Lord Wimborne]] the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], declared martial law to maintain order in the streets of [[Dublin]]. This was later extended both in duration and geographical reach to the whole of the country with the consent of the British government. Much of Ireland was declared under martial law by the British authorities during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. A large portion of Ireland was also under de facto martial law during the [[Irish Civil War]].

The current Irish Constitution allows for martial law if the government declares a state of emergency, however capital punishment is prohibited in all circumstances, including a state of emergency.

If he subsequently infiltrated back into the country (including to his home village), he was regarded "as illegal" and could be summarily deported.

Following the 1967 war, in which the Israeli army occupied the [[West Bank]], [[Gaza Strip]], Golan Heights in Syria, and Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, martial law over the Palestinian population as well as the Jordanian, Syrian, and Egyptian populations in these areas was put in place. In 1993, Israel agreed to give autonomy to the people of Gaza and disengaged militarily from Gaza from 2005 until 2007, when a military blockade was put in place on Gaza in response to the election of Hamas to the local government.

During the [[2006 Lebanon war]], martial law was declared by Defense Minister [[Amir Peretz]] over the north of the country.

{{Main article|Military coups in Pakistan}}

Martial law was declared in [[Pakistan]] on 7 October 1958, by President Iskander Mirza who then appointed General Muhammad Ayub Khan as the Chief Martial Law Administrator and Aziz Ahmad as Secretary General and Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrator. However, three weeks later General Ayub—who had been openly questioning the authority of the government before the imposition of martial law—deposed Iskandar Mirza on 27 October 1958 and assumed the presidency that practically formalized the militarization of the political system in Pakistan. Four years later a new document, Constitution of 1962, was adopted. The second martial law was imposed on 25 March 1969, when President Ayub Khan abrogated the Constitution of 1962 and handed over power to the Army Commander-in-Chief, General Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan. On assuming the presidency, General Yahya Khan acceded to popular demands by abolishing the one-unit system in West Pakistan and ordered general elections on the principle of one man one vote.

The third was imposed by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the first civilian to hold this post in Pakistan after the Bangladesh Liberation War. On 21 December 1971, Bhutto took this post as well as that of President.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chief Martial Law Administrator#Pakistan]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth was imposed by the General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] on 5 July 1977. After several tumultuous years, which witnessed the secession of [[East Pakistan]], politician [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] took over in 1971 as the first civilian martial law administrator in recent history, imposing selective martial law in areas hostile to his rule, such as the country's largest province, [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]. Following widespread [[civil disorder]], General Zia overthrew Bhutto and imposed martial law in its totality on July 5, 1977, in a bloodless [[coup d'état]]. Unstable areas were brought under control through indirect [[military action]], such as Balochistan under Martial Law Governor, General [[Rahimuddin Khan]]. Civilian government resumed in 1988 following General Zia's death in an aircraft crash.

On October 12, 1999, the government of Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] was dissolved, and the Army took control once more. But no martial law was imposed. General [[Pervez Musharraf]] took the title of [[Chief Executive]] until the [[President of Pakistan]] [[Rafiq Tarar]] resigned and General Musharraf became president. Elections were held in October 2002 and [[Zafarullah Khan Jamali|Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali]] became [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]]. Jamali premiership was followed by [[Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain]] and [[Shaukat Aziz]]. While the government was supposed to be run by the elected prime minister, there was a common understanding that important decisions were made by the President General Musharraf.

On November 3, 2007, President General Musharraf declared the state of emergency in the country which is claimed to be equivalent to the state of martial law as the constitution of Pakistan of 1973 was suspended, and the Chief Justices of the Supreme Court were fired.

On November 12, 2007, Musharraf issued some amendments in the Military Act, which gave the armed forces some additional powers.

{{main article|Martial law in the Philippines}}
During the [[World War II in the Philippines|Second World War]], [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[José P. Laurel]] placed the [[Second Philippine Republic|Philippines]] (then a [[client state]] of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]]) under martial law via Proclamation № 29, dated 21 September 1944 and enforced the following day at 09:00 [[Philippine Standard Time|PST]]. Proclamation № 30 was issued on 23 September, declaring the existence of a [[war|state of war]] between the [[Philippines]] and the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], effective 10:00 that day.

The country was under martial law again from 1972 to 1981 under the administration of [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. [[Proclamation № 1081]] ("Proclaiming a State of Martial Law in the Philippines") was signed on 21 September 1972 and came into force on 22 September. The official reason behind the declaration was to suppress increasing civil strife and the threat of a [[CPP-NPA-NDF rebellion|communist takeover]], particularly after a series of bombings (including the [[Plaza Miranda bombing|Plaza Miranda Incident]]) and an assassination attempt on [[Secretary of National Defense (Philippines)|Defense Minister]] [[Juan Ponce Enrile]] in [[Mandaluyong]].

The policy of martial law was initially well received, but it eventually proved unpopular as the military's [[Human rights in the Philippines|human rights]] abuses (use of [[torture]] in intelligence gathering, [[forced disappearance]]s), along with the decadence and excess of Marcos allies, had emerged. Coupled with economic downturns, these factors fermented dissent in various sectors (e.g. the urban [[middle class]]) that crystallised with the [[assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr.|assassination]] of jailed oppositionist [[Senate of the Philippines|senator]] [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] in 1983, and widespread fraud in the [[Philippine presidential election, 1986|1986 snap elections]]. These eventually led to the [[1986 People Power Revolution]] that ousted Marcos and forced him into exile in [[Hawaii]] where he died in 1989; his rival presidential candidate and Aquino's widow, [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon]], was installed as his successor.

During this 9-year period, curfews were implemented as a safety measure. Majority of radio and television networks were suspended. Journalists who were accused of speaking against the government were taken as political prisoners, some of them to be physically abused and tortured by the authorities.

Others have stated that the implementation of Martial Law was taken advantage by the Marcos regime. Billion pesos worth of property and ill-gotten wealth was said to be acquired by Marcos' wife, Imelda Marcos. This alleged money laundering issue was brought back recently, particularly in the ''[[PiliPinas Debates 2016]]'' for the recently held Philippine Presidential Elections on May 9, 2016. Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos, Jr., Marcos' son, ran for Vice President and lost.

There were rumours that President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] was planning to impose martial law to end military ''[[coup d'etat]]'' plots, general civilian dissatisfaction, and criticism of her legitimacy arising from the dubious results of the [[Philippine presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential elections]]. Instead, a [[2006 state of emergency in the Philippines|State of National Emergency]] was imposed in 2006 from 24 February to 3 March, in order to quash a coup attempt and quell protesters.

On 4 December 2009, President Arroyo officially placed the [[Provinces of the Philippines|Province]] of [[Maguindanao]] under a state of martial law through Proclamation № 1959.&lt;ref name="gmanews.tv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/178575/arroyo-declares-martial-law-in-maguindanao|title=Arroyo declares martial law in Maguindanao province|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the last imposition, the declaration suspended the [[writ of habeas corpus]] in the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20091205-240233/Martial-law-declared-in-Maguindanao |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207090214/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20091205-240233/Martial-law-declared-in-Maguindanao |archivedate=2009-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement came days after hundreds of government troops were sent to the province to raid the armories of the powerful Ampatuan clan. The Ampatuans were implicated in the [[Maguindanao Massacre|massacre of 58 persons]], including women from the rival [[Esmael Mangudadatu|Mangudadatu clan]], human rights lawyers, and 31 media workers. Cited as one of the bloodiest incidents of political violence in Philippine history, the massacre was condemned worldwide as the worst loss of life of media professionals in one day.&lt;ref name="gmanews.tv"/&gt;

On 23 May 2017, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] of the [[Philippines]] declared martial law in [[Mindanao]], through [[Proclamation No. 216]], due to the [[Marawi crisis|attack]] of [[Maute Group]] in [[Marawi City]], [[Lanao del Sur]]. It was announced in a briefing in Moscow by Secretary [[Ernesto Abella]],&lt;ref name="news.abs-cbn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/05/23/17/duterte-declares-martial-law-in-mindanao|title=Duterte declares Martial Law in Mindanao|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will be in effect until December.

Martial law was introduced in [[Poland#Postwar communist Poland|Communist Poland]] on December 13, 1981 by Generals [[Czesław Kiszczak]] and [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] to prevent democratic opposition from gaining popularity and political power in the country. Thousands of people linked to democratic opposition, including [[Lech Wałęsa]], were arbitrarily arrested and detained. About 100 deaths are attributed to the martial law, including 9 miners shot by the police during the pacification of striking [[Wujek Coal Mine]]. The martial law was lifted July 22, 1983.

Following [[World War II]], the island of Taiwan came back to  [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|China]]'s control given the impending withdrawal of Japanese forces and colonial government.　Martial law was declared in 1949 despite the democracy promised in the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] (the [[Republic of China]] refused to implement the constitution on Taiwan until after 1949). After the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]]-led Republic of China government lost control of the mainland to the [[Communist Party of China]] and retreated to Taiwan in 1949, the perceived need to suppress Communist activities in Taiwan was utilised as a rationale for not lifting martial law until thirty-eight years later in 1987, just prior to the death of then President [[Chiang Ching-kuo]].

Today, still present martial law systems like in Syria (since the [[1963 Syrian coup d'état]]) or in the West Bank (since the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] with Israel) have surpassed Taiwan as longer ranging periods of active martial law.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Since the foundation of the Republic of [[Turkey]] in 1923 the [[Turkish Armed Forces|military]] conducted three [[Coup d'état|coups d'état]] and announced martial law.

On July 15, 2016 a section of the military in Turkey attempted a coup(failed) and said to have implied martial law in a broadcast on their national television TRT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/16/world/europe/military-attempts-coup-in-turkey-prime-minister-says.html|title=Turkish President Returns to Istanbul in Sign Military Coup Is Faltering|first1=Tim|last1=Arango|first2=Ceylan|last2=Yeginsu|date=15 July 2016|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The restrictions from martial law were defined in a 2015 law "On the Legal Regime of Martial Law". The president decides on the declaration of martial law and then parliament must approve it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/what-martial-law-in-ukraine-could-mean-for-nation.html|title=What martial law in Ukraine could mean for nation|publisher=Kyiv Post|author=Matthew Kupfer|date=26 November 2018|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://iportal.rada.gov.ua/en/news/News/108880.html|title=Verkhovna Rada adopts Law "On legal regime of martial law"|publisher=Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine|date=12 May 2015|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 November 2018, lawmakers in the Ukraine Parliament overwhelmingly backed the imposition of martial law along Ukraine's coastal regions and those bordering Russia and [[Transnistria]], a breakaway state of [[Moldova]] which has [[14th Army involvement in Transnistria|Russian troops stationed]] in its territory, in response to the [[2018 Kerch Strait incident|firing upon and seizure]] of Ukrainian naval ships by Russia near the Crimean peninsula a day earlier. A total of 276 lawmakers in Kiev backed the measure, which took effect on 28 November 2018 and will automatically expire in 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-ukraine-live-latest-update-martial-law-black-sea-ships-navy-crisis-a8651736.html|title=Kiev declares martial law after Russian seizure of Ukrainian ships in Black Sea|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{flag|SFR Yugoslavia}}===
During the [[Yugoslav Wars]] in 1991, a "State of Direct War Threat" was declared. Although forces from the whole [[SFRY]] were included in this conflict, martial law was never announced, but after secession, [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] declared martial law. On March 23, 1999, a "State of Direct War Threat" was declared in [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], following the possibility of [[NATO]] air-strikes. The day after strikes began, martial law was declared, which lasted until June 1999, although strikes ended on June 10, following [[Kumanovo Treaty]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==={{flag|United States}}===
{{Main|Martial law in the United States}}
{{See also|Suspension clause}}
In the United States, [[martial law]] has been used in a limited number of circumstances, such as directly after a foreign attack, such as Hawaii after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] or New Orleans during the [[Battle of New Orleans]], after major disasters, such as the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871 or the San Francisco [[earthquake of 1906]], by renegade local leaders seeking to avoid arrest, such as [[Nauvoo, Illinois]] during the [[Illinois Mormon War]], or [[Utah]] during the [[Utah War]], or in response to chaos associated with protests and mob action, such as the [[1934 West Coast waterfront strike]], or mob actions against the [[Freedom Riders]].  

The martial law concept in the [[United States]] is closely tied with the right of ''[[habeas corpus]]'', which is in essence the right to a hearing on lawful imprisonment, or more broadly, the supervision of law enforcement by the judiciary. The ability to suspend ''habeas corpus'' is related to the imposition of martial law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=G. Edward White|title=Law in American History: Volume 1: From the Colonial Years Through the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP1oAgAAQBAJ|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-972314-0|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP1oAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA442&amp;dq=%22martial+law%22+%22habeas+corpus%22 442]|quote=As the above details suggest, the imposition of martial law and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus are related, but do not perform identical functions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 1, Section 9 of the [[US Constitution]] states, "The Privilege of the Writ of ''Habeas Corpus'' shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it."  There have been many instances of the use of the military within the borders of the United States, such as during the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] and in the South during the [[Civil Rights Movement]], but these acts are not tantamount to a declaration of martial law. The distinction must be made as clear as that between martial law and [[military justice]]: deployment of troops does not necessarily mean that the civil courts cannot function, and that is one of the keys, as the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] noted, to martial law.

In [[United States law]], martial law is limited by several court decisions that were handed down between the [[American Civil War]] and [[World War II]]. In 1878, [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] passed the [[Posse Comitatus Act]], which forbids military involvement in domestic law enforcement without congressional approval.

In [[copyright law]], a '''mechanical license''' is a license that grants certain limited permissions to work with, study, improve upon, reinterpret, re-record (etc.) something that is neither a [[free content|free]]/[[open source]] item nor in the [[public domain]].

==Concept==
Most modern music consists of two distinct copyright elements. One is the composition itself, which consists of both the musical composition and the lyrics, each which may have separate copyrights. The second is the sound recording, which covers both tangible copies ("phonorecord") of the performance of the work (such as vinyl albums, cassette tapes, CDs, and digital formats like MP3s) and public performances of the recording (such as over the radio).&lt;ref name="verge march 2018"/&gt; The copyright between the composition and the sound recording is frequently held by different parties.&lt;ref name="verge march 2018"/&gt;

A mechanical license is a license provided by the holder of the copyright of the composition or musical work to another party to cover, reproduce, or sample specific parts of the original composition.&lt;ref name="verge march 2018"/&gt;  Within [[copyright law]] within the United states, such mechanical licenses are [[compulsory license|compulsory]]; any party may obtain a license without permission of the license holder by paying a set license fee, that as of 2018, was set at 9.1 cents per composition or 1.75 cents per minute of composition which are to go to the composition copyright holder.&lt;ref name="verge march 2018"/&gt; These fees are paid to agencies like the [[Harry Fox Agency]], who either already represent the composition copyright holders, or are able to direct the funds to the right party.&lt;ref name="verge march 2018"/&gt; Mechanical licenses do not apply the sound recording portion of the composition, and instead a separate non-mechanical license must be sought from the copyright holder of the sound recording (typically, the musical performer or their agency representing them).

For example:  Puff Daddy wants to sample the opening riff from “Every Breath You Take” by The Police.  He contacts the copyright holder of the underlying musical work and gets a mechanical license to use all or part of The Police’s song in his composition. He now has the right to reproduce all or part of “Every Breath You Take” in his new song. He cannot, however, purchase The Police’s Greatest Hits, take the CD (or MP3 from iTunes) into the studio, pull the track off of the phonorecord, and sample the riff into his new song.  For Puff Daddy to sample from the phonorecord of The Police’s music, he must get both a mechanical license from the copyright holder of the underlying musical work, ''and'' a license from the copyright holder of the phonorecord from which he copies the sample.  He is free to hire musicians to reproduce the Police's sound, but he cannot copy from any phonorecord with only a mechanical license.

A mechanical license can only be used after the original copyright holder has exercised their exclusive right of first publishing, or permission is negotiated.&lt;ref name="MBLG"&gt;{{cite book

  | page= 65 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In American law, US Code Title 17, Chapter 1, Section 115(a)(2) states: "A compulsory license includes the privilege of making a musical arrangement of the work to the extent necessary to conform it to the style or manner of interpretation of the performance involved, but the arrangement shall not change the basic melody or fundamental character of the work ..." thus preventing mechanical licenses being used to make substantially derivative works of a piece of music.&lt;ref name="USC17115"&gt;{{cite web

  | url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/115-
  | accessdate = 2008-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musicians often use this license for self-promotion. For instance, a cellist who performed a musical work on a recording may obtain a mechanical license so he can distribute copies of the recording to others as an example of his cello playing. Recording artists also use this when they record [[cover versions]] of songs. This is common among artists who don't usually write their own songs. In the [[United States]], this is required by [[U.S. Copyright Law|copyright law]] regardless whether or not the copies are for commercial sale.

A mechanical license is not required for artists who record and distribute completely original work.&lt;ref name="HFA"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2010-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea of mechanical licenses came about the turn of the 19th century, with the popularity of [[player piano]]s, with the ability to play songs encoded on a roll of paper. The [[sheet music]] industry then believed that the recreation of their songs was violation of copyright, and initiated legal action that resulted in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] case, ''[[White-Smith Music Publishing Co. v. Apollo Co.]]'' (209 U.S. 1) in 1908. The Supreme Court ruled that the piano rolls were not copies of the plantiff's music, but instead part of the machine that created music, and thus player piano and piano roll makers did not have to pay royalties to the sheet music composers. Songwriters lobbied to the [[United States Congress]] following the ruling, and succeeded in establishing the nature of mechanical licenses in the [[Copyright Act of 1909]].&lt;ref name="verge march 2018"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/14/17117160/spotify-mechanical-license-copyright-wixen-explainer | title = A $1.6 Billion Spotify Lawsuit Is Based On A Law Made For Player Pianos | first = Sarah | last=  Jeong | date = March 14, 2018 | accessdate=  March 14, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the nature of copyright law with respect to mechanical licenses have been continually updated to include new types of phonorecords mediums and recordings. For example, in October 2006 the [[United States Copyright Office|Register of Copyright]] ruled that [[ring tone]]s are subject to compulsory licensing.&lt;ref name="BDRW"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2007-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Music Modernization Act]] passed in 2018 implemented processes for digital streaming services to pay for the compulsory mechanical license through a new non-profit organization created by the law.

'''''Monsanto Co. v. Rohm and Haas Co.''''', 456 F.2d 592 (3d Cir. 1972), is a 1972 decision of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] interpreting what conduct amounts to fraudulent procurement of a [[patent]]. It is one of the early decisions following the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court's]] landmark 1964 decision in ''[[Walker Process v. Food Machinery]]'' holding fraud on the patent office as potentially violating the Sherman Antitrust Act, and one of the first (if not the first) to hold that failure to disclose material information to the Patent Office was fraudulent.

==Background==

[[Monsanto]] procured U.S. Patent No. No. 3,382,280, issued May 7, 1968, having the title ''3',4'-dichloropropionanilide'' (known as ''3,4-DCPA'' or ''[[propanil]]''), a herbicide that selectively killed weeds without killing crop plants such as rice.&lt;ref&gt;With an estimated use of about 8 million pounds in 2001, propanil is one of the more widely used herbicides in the United States. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, [http://www.epa.gov/oppbead1/pestsales/01pestsales/usage2001_2.htm 2000-2001 Pesticide Market Estimates].&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1969 Monsanto sued [[Rohm and Haas]] for patent infringement. The only substantial issue was the validity of the patent, and that ultimately turned on whether Monsanto had committed fraud on the Patent Office in procuring the patent.&lt;ref&gt;''Monsanto Co. v. Rohm &amp; Haas Co.'', 456 F.2d 592, 596 (3d Cir. 1972) ("In the view we take, it becomes necessary to reach only the misrepresentation issue.").&lt;/ref&gt;

The application that resulted in the '280 patent was the third of three successive applications, the first two of which were unsuccessful. In the first application, filed in 1957, Monsanto sought a patent on some 100 "compounds, including 3,4-DCPA and 3,4-DCAA (3,4-dichloroacetanilide), a chemical with some similar properties and a similar physical structure. Monsanto claimed that all the members of the class possessed "unusual and valuable herbicidal activity," while related compounds possessed "little or no herbicidal efficiency." Unpersuaded by Monsanto's arguments, the Patent Office rejected the application as unpatentable over the prior art. In 1961, Monsanto filed a new application claiming another large class of compounds, again including 3,4-DCPA and 3,4-DCAA and again asserting that the class possessed "unusual and valuable herbicidal activity." Again, the Patent Office rejected the application as unpatentable over the prior art. In 1967, Monsanto applied again, this time claiming only 3,4-DCPA and representing only that 3,4-DCPA had "unusual and valuable herbicidal activity" and that its activity was "surprising" because "related compounds possess little or no herbicidal efficiency." Again. the Patent Office (initially) rejected the application on the ground that the product was obvious over the prior art. But this time Monsanto overcame the rejection.&lt;ref&gt;456 F.2d at 596.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

A major issue in the Patent Office was whether the patent application should be denied because 3,4-DCPA was obvious from previously known products, the most significant of which was 3,4-DCAA (3,4-dichloroacetanilide), a chemical with some similar properties and a similar physical structure. Both were useful in making pigments and both had herbicidal properties. The structural difference between the two "closely related" compounds was that 3,4-DCAA "differ[ed] in its structural formula solely by having one less CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group" than 3,4-DCPA.&lt;ref&gt;456 F.2d at 596. Such pairs of compounds are termed "adjacent homologues" and they are known to have similar chemical and physical properties. See article [[homologous series]]. See also ''In re Henze'', 181 F.2d 196, 201 (CCPA 1950), in which the court stated, "In effect, the nature of homologues and the close relationship the physical and chemical properties of one member of a series bears to adjacent members is such that a presumption of unpatentability arises against a claim directed to a composition of matter, the adjacent homologue of which is old in the art."&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the similarity in structure between 3,4-DCPA and other chemicals, including 3,4-DCAA, the Patent Office rejected the patent application on obviousness grounds. Monsanto then tried to persuade the Office to withdraw the rejection by submitting documents to show that DCPA was not obvious, because it had greatly superior and unexpected selective herbicidal activity.

Monsanto filed the Husted Affidavit. The trial court found that this document "contains no affirmative misrepresentation and is accurate so far as it goes" but "it is misleading, and was intended to be misleading, in that it fails to state facts known to the applicant which were inconsistent with its position that propanil is a superior herbicide."&lt;ref&gt;''Monsanto Co. v. Rohm and Haas Co.'', 312 F. Supp. 778, 791 (E.D. Pa. 1970)&lt;/ref&gt; The court of appeals commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The patent was issued, however, .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. after Monsanto submitted an affidavit of Dr. Robert F. Husted, based on tests performed by him on twenty plant species at three different rates of application per acre. The report as presented to the Patent Office asserted that 3,4-DCPA completely killed or severely injured nine of the eleven species and failed to have any effect on only two. Eight other compounds were reported to have no effect on any of the eleven plants and two other compounds, one of them 3,4-DCAA, either had very slight or no effect. Significantly, although the Husted tests entailed tests on twenty species, at three separate rates of application per acre, the Patent Office was informed of tests on only eleven species and only at one rate of application, two pounds per acre. In all, the affidavit showed less than 25 per cent of Husted's results; of 899 tests, only 110 were submitted. The district court concluded that this close-cropping of Husted's findings amounted to misrepresentation.&lt;ref&gt;456 F.2d at 596-97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under applicable law, as understood by the court, if a compound on which a patent is sought is very similar in structure to a known compound, as 3,4-DCPA and 3,4-DCAA were, a rebuttable presumption arises that the later compound is obvious from the earlier one. "To rebut this presumption it must be shown 'that the claimed compound possesse[d] unobvious or unexpected beneficial properties not actually possessed by the prior art homologue.'&amp;#82239;"&lt;ref&gt;312 F. Supp. at 789. The court said that the reason for this rule is that "the characteristics normally possessed by members of a homologous series are principally the same, and vary but gradually from member to member. Chemists knowing the properties of one member of a series would in general know what to expect in adjacent members." ''Id''. at 790.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Husted Affidavit thus appeared to rebut the obviousness rejection by showing that 3,4-DCPA possessed an unexpected beneficial herbicidal property that 3,4-DCAA and other products lacked. The Husted Affidavit misled the Patent Office, the trial court said, because both 3,4-DCPA and 3,4-DCAA "in fact possess the newly discovered property of the claimed compound."&lt;ref&gt;312 F. Supp. at 790.&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial court said that Monsanto submitted a fraudulent affidavit in that: "It is, in short, composed of half-truths." The court pointed to such omissions as these which made the affidavit one of half-truths:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For example, one omitted test result showed that 3,4-DCAA had a complete kill on pigweed at 2 lbs. per acre of application, just as 3,4-DCPA did. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. Monsanto, by the Husted affidavit, attempted to show that closely related compounds do not possess unique herbicidal properties. The facts not stated were, therefore material."&lt;ref&gt;312 F.Supp. 791-92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The district court held the patent invalid and Monsanto appealed top the Third Circuit.

==Decision of Third Circuit==

The Third Circuit affirmed the district court's judgment of fraud (2-1) in an opinion by Circuit Judge Aldisert.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/19721048456F2d592_1896/MONSANTO%20COMPANY%20v.%20ROHM%20&amp;%20HAAS%20COMPANY 456 F.2d 592] (3d Cir. 1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Majority opinion===

The court looked at the Husted Affidavit in light of its place in the three successive Monsanto patent applications:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In view of Huffman's previously unsuccessful attempts to obtain a patent, it is reasonable to conclude that his success with his 1968 application, originally rejected by the examiner, and later accepted after presentation of the Husted Report, was attributed to his emphasis that the compound possessed properties of 'surprising .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. herbicidal efficiency' not possessed by related compounds.&lt;ref&gt;456 F.2d at 599.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whether 3,4-DCPA really was surprisingly superior to related compounds as a herbicide was therefore critical to the patent prosecution and to whether Monsanto had committed fraud on the Patent Office. The court rejected Monsanto's argument that in the affidavit it was merely putting its best foot forward:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Husted affidavit to the Patent Office did not nearly reflect the total Husted test as transmitted to Huffman. Indeed, an examination of the report permits, if not compels, the misleading inference that it constituted a complete and accurate analysis of all the testing instead of an edited version thereof. Concealment and nondisclosure may be evidence of and equivalent to a false representation, because the concealment or suppression is, in effect, a representation that what is disclosed is the whole truth.&lt;ref&gt;456 F.2d at 599. The Third Circuit noted but rejected the conclusion of a Texas district court that addressed these issues in ''Monsanto v. Dawson Chemical Corp.'', 312 F.Supp. 452 (S.D. Tex. 1970). The Third Circuit said: "We do not find persuasive that court's treatment of the misrepresentation issue or its conclusion that Monsanto 'did nothing more than put their best foot forward.'&amp;#8239;" 456 F.2d at 597 n.4 (quoting 312 F. Supp. at 463).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Looking at this pattern of conduct, the court said, "[W]e cannot bring ourselves to say that the application for the 1968 patent displayed that standard of conduct demanded under the circumstances." Rather, "Monsanto was obliged to disclose more information as to the herbicidal properties of related compounds to the Patent Office than it did." The reason is that "what is at issue is not merely a contest between the parties but a public interest" that spurious patents should not issue. As a result of Monsanto's truncated disclosure of the facts concerning 3,4-DCPA's comparative efficacy as a herbicide, "it was impossible for the Patent Office fairly to assess Monsanto's application against the prevailing statutory criteria."&lt;ref&gt;456 F.2d at 600.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, Monsanto's failure to disclose amounted to misrepresentation transgressing equitable standards of conduct owed the public by the applicant in return for its monopoly. Accordingly, Monsanto was not entitled to the patent monopoly, and the district court did not err in [invalidating the patent].&lt;ref&gt;456 F.2d at 600-01.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Dissent===

Judge Kalodner dissented. First, he said, the majority decided the case on the basis of the preponderance of evidence but it should have used the "clear and convincing evidence" standard.&lt;ref&gt;The majority opinion took issue with this assertion, which was based with a colloquy with counsel. The trial court's conclusions of law stated that "[u]pon our examination of the record, we have concluded that Rohm and Haas has met its burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing proof." 456 F.2d at 601 n.14 (quoting 312 F.Supp. at 797).&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, the district court erroneously said that it was not necessary to prove specific intent to deceive the Patent Office "when there is evidence of a deliberate withholding of material information," and that the patent must be rejected "even if the decision not to disclose was motivated by nothing more than bad judgment as to the materiality of the information."&lt;ref&gt;The majority opinion took issue with this assertion, pointing out that it was an alternative holding and that the district court's statement in full was, "&amp;#8239;'Even if we were persuaded to change our mind' and find that 'Monsanto did not intend to mislead, .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. a specific intent to deceive is not necessary where there is evidence of deliberate withholding of material information'&amp;#8239;" 456 F.2d at 601 n.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, it was not shown that the Patent Office "would not have issued the patent but for the claimed fraudulent conduct." There was no proof that the Patent Office was misled.&lt;ref&gt;456 F.2d 603-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary==

In an article in the ''George Washington Law Review'', Irving Kayton criticized "the Third Circuit's ignorance of the accepted manner and practice, defined by statute and rule, in which patent prosecution takes place."&lt;ref&gt;Irving Kayton, John F. Lynch, Richard H. Stern, [http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?men_tab=srchresults&amp;handle=hein.journals/gwlr43&amp;id=14&amp;size=2&amp;collection=journals&amp;terms=Patent%20Fraud&amp;termtype=phrase&amp;set_as_cursor= ''Fraud in Patent Procurement: Genuine and Sham Charges''], 43 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1, 99 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; Kayton said that it was the responsibility of the patent examiner to review the records of the earlier stages of the patent prosecution, and there is a legal presumption that the examiner did that; that examination would have disclosed the information that Monsanto withheld in the Husted Affidavit. Accordingly, Kayton argued, "Monsanto['s] patent solicitor was thus completely justified in attributing actual, but at the least, constructive knowledge to the examiner of the contents of the disclosures of both the 1961 and 1957 applications."&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Co-author [[Richard H. Stern]] disagreed with his colleague on this issue. Stern maintained, "The proposed reliance on constructive knowledge, and the indulgence in legal fictions and presumptions that follows, has far more flavor of a determination not to learn damaging facts than it has of the candor required in such cases."&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 100 n.*.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, argued Kayton, the fact that the Third Circuit and the judge in the similar Texas case disagreed over whether Monsanto was just "putting its best foot forward" or instead was intentionally defrauding the Patent Office indicates that reasonable men can differ: "This being so, is it not an inescapable conclusion .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. that the Monsanto patent solicitor's [conduct] .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. was at worst a nonculpable mistake of judgment?"&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, co-author Stern disagreed: "No. The Third Circuit, on the contrary, appears to have thought that Judge Singleton's views were plainly erroneous, and that his acceptance of the patentee's theory that 'it is all right to put your best foot forward with the Patent Office' was contrary to the legal standard as to candor required in ex parte proceedings of this type. Given so thoroughly erroneous a concept of the standard of candor, it is neither surprising that in the circumstances
of this case the judge using that legal standard found no fraud nor surprising that the judges rejecting it found fraud."&lt;ref&gt;''Id'' at 99 n.*.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another discussion of this case faults the district court's decision for purporting to invalidate the patent for fraud, and by implication the subsequent Third Circuit affirmance. The stated basis of the criticism is that fraudulent procurement does not invalidate a patent, but merely makes it permanently unenforceable.&lt;ref&gt;See Donald R. Dunner, James B, Gambrell, and Irving Kayton, [http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?men_tab=srchresults&amp;handle=hein.journals/annam1970&amp;id=433&amp;size=2&amp;collection=journals&amp;terms=fraud|Monsanto|PATENT|Patent&amp;termtype=phrase&amp;set_as_cursor= ''Patent Law (1969-70)''], in [1970] {{smallcaps|Ann.

'''Movielink''' was a [[World Wide Web|web]]-based [[video on demand]] (VOD) and [[electronic sell-through]] (EST) service offering movies, TV shows and other videos for rental or purchase. Movielink drew its content offerings from the libraries of [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Universal Studios]], [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Entertainment]], [[Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group|Buena Vista Pictures]] (including [[Miramax Films|Miramax]]), [[Twentieth Century Fox]], [[Koch Entertainment]] and others on a non-exclusive basis.  While it was only available to users in the United States, it was the first company in the world to offer legally downloadable movies from major studios.

In general, movies obtained through Movielink could only be viewed on the computer or a TV connected to the computer that the movie was purchased from.  However, consumer electronics devices such as the [[Xbox 360]] game console also allowed users to more easily view these digital media on a traditional TV screen.&lt;ref name="PC to TV"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.movielink.com/kb/user/article.jsf?id=4 |title=Movielink FAQ: How do I connect my PC to my TV? |accessdate=2007-08-10 |publisher=Movielink.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812033259/http://www.movielink.com/kb/user/article.jsf?id=4 |archivedate=August 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, Movielink had deals with certain set top box companies to offer its movies downloaded directly to people's TV's (including AT&amp;T's Homezone product).&lt;ref name="Homezone"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.movielink.com/store/web/help/watchOnTV.jsp |title=Movielink - Watch Movielink on Your TV! |accessdate=2007-08-10 |publisher=Movielink.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712030356/http://www.movielink.com/store/web/help/watchOnTV.jsp |archivedate=July 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experimentation with other [[business model]]s was underway, including a feature which allowed users to purchase, download, and burn a DVD of a selected film.

==History==
Movielink was launched on November 11, 2002. Movielink used [[digital rights management]] software from [[Microsoft]] and [[RealNetworks]] to protect their content.  Consequently, compatibility was limited to [[Wintel|Intel-based computers]] running [[Microsoft Windows 2000]], [[Microsoft Windows XP|XP]],or [[Microsoft Windows Vista|Vista]] and [[Windows Media Player]] version 9 or later.&lt;ref name="Sys Req"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.movielink.com/kb/user/article.jsf?id=300007 |title=Movielink FAQ: What are the system requirements? |accessdate=2007-08-10 |publisher=Movielink.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016101903/http://movielink.com/kb/user/article.jsf?id=300007 |archivedate=October 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They offered daily weekday specials for under 99 cents, and certain films for half price every week.

On June 1, 2006, it was revealed that Movielink's initial investors—a joint venture of Paramount, Sony, MGM, Universal, and Warner Bros—were looking to sell the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/may2006/tc20060531_484649.htm?campaign_id=rss_tech |title=Bloomberg Business |work=Bloomberg.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625083655/http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/may2006/tc20060531_484649.htm?campaign_id=rss_tech |archivedate=2006-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This came shortly after numerous studios announced their intent to work with a range of potential Movielink competitors, such as [[Amazon.com]], [[Apple Computer]], [[BitTorrent Inc.]], [[Jaman]] and [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox]].

On August 8, 2007, Blockbuster purchased Movielink.  According to the 8-K filing by Blockbuster, the total purchase price was $6.6 million. The deal included content agreements thus giving Blockbuster access to one of the largest libraries of downloadable movies.  With the acquisition of Movielink, Blockbuster was positioned for media content delivery in [[brick and mortar]] rentals, [[DVD-by-mail]], and online delivery of movies.&lt;ref name="Blockbuster acquisition"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/070809/mvw073.html?.v=1|title=Press Release: MultiVu Video Feed: Blockbuster Inc.

On December 16, 2008, the Movielink website was shut down. The site was re-directed to the [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster]] [[home page]]. Customers were notified 30 days in advance that all movies rented or purchased prior to the shutdown date must be downloaded by no later than 12/15/08 11:59 P.M. Pacific Time.

'''Note issuance facility (NIF)''' is an [[underwriting]] agreement/arrangement in the [[Eurocurrency]] market under which borrowers place short/medium term (one to six months) notes via a [[syndicate]] of prime/[[commercial bank]]s, and the borrowers' issue is backed by the commitment of the syndicate banks to purchase any paper which the borrowers may be unable to sell.&lt;ref&gt;OECD – Glossary http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=1850&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reserve Bank of India http://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/content/pdfs/87359.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Since the facility/guarantee itself is contingent, the creation of NIF does not give rise to an entry in the [[financial account]] and will be treated as an off-[[balance sheet]] item in the guarantor books. When the underwriting institution is requested to make funds available, it will acquire the actual asset (notes) and will be recorded in the financial account.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18412">'''Oil and gas law in the United States''' is the branch of law that pertains to the acquisition and [[property law|ownership rights]] in [[oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] both under the soil before discovery and after its [[rule of capture|capture]], and [[adjudication]] regarding those rights.

== Overview ==
[[Image:Oil2.JPG|thumb|Drilling companies most often lease the rights to drill for and produce oil.]]
The law regulating oil and gas ownership in the US generally differs significantly from laws in Europe because oil and gas are often owned privately in the US as opposed to being owned by the national government in many other countries.

=== Jurisdiction ===
In the [[United States|U.S.]], extraction of oil and gas is generally regulated by the individual states through [[statute]]s and [[common law]]. [[United States federal law|Federal]] and [[United States constitutional law|constitutional law]] apply as well.

== Ownership ==
In the United States, oil and gas rights to a particular parcel may be owned by private individuals, corporations, Indian tribes, or by local, state, or federal governments. Oil and gas rights extend vertically downward from the property line. Unless explicitly separated by a deed, oil and gas rights are owned by the surface landowner.

Oil and gas rights [[offshore drilling|offshore]] are owned by either the state or federal government and leased to oil companies for development. The [[tidelands controversy]] involve the limits of state ownership.

Although oil and gas laws vary by state, the laws regarding ownership prior to, at, and after extraction are nearly universal.

=== Prior to and at extraction ===
Because oil and gas are fluids, they may flow in the subsurface across property boundaries. In this way, an operator may permissibly extract oil and gas from beneath the land of another, if the extraction is lawfully conducted on his own property&lt;ref&gt;''Kelly v. Ohio Oil Co.'', 57 Ohio St. 317, 49 N.E. 399 (1897).&lt;/ref&gt;. An operator may not angle a well to penetrate beneath property not owned by or leased to him.

The two conflicting legal doctrines covering oil and gas extraction are the [[rule of capture]], and the [[correlative rights doctrine]].  Which of the doctrines applies in a particular case depends on state law, which varies considerably from state to state, or in the case of the federal offshore zone, on U.S. federal law.

The rule of capture provides that an oil producer with a wellbore on his property is allowed to drain oil out from underneath his land—even if some of that oil originated from a neighbor's land, migrating to the oil producer's land through geologic forces or drainage. The rule of capture gives landowners an incentive to pump out oil as quickly as possible by accelerating operations or drilling multiple wells to capture the oil of their neighbors. Such practice may deplete the gas pressure needed to force oil from the ground, which will reduce the amount of oil available for recovery from that reservoir. State law often limits the rule of capture to protect correlative rights of neighboring owners.&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Lowe]], ''Oil and Gas Law in a Nutshell'' (5th ed. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Government agencies and state oil and gas conservation commissions, such as the [[Texas Railroad Commission]], have developed conservation laws which regulate extraction by individual owners to protect the rights of the mineral owners and to prevent economic and physical waste.

===Split estates===
Mineral rights may be severed by a deed from the surface rights. Such a condition is called a split estate. Once severed from surface ownership, oil and gas rights may be bought, sold, or transferred, like other real estate property. Ownership in the oil and gas rights for different horizontal layers, or strata, may be further divided and sold to different parties. In some states, severed mineral rights revert to the landowner if the mineral right not exercised for a certain time period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/when_do_mineral_rights_revert_to_the_landowner When do severed mineral rights revert to the landowner?] Michigan State Extension Service, accessed 8 Nov. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In most states, unless otherwise specified by a deed, the owner of the oil and gas interest is presumed to have the right to occupy as much of the surface property as is reasonably needed to extract the oil and gas, subject to regulations for minimum distances from homes or buildings. Courts have generally held that, without this implied right of access and surface occupancy, ownership of the oil and gas rights would be meaningless. This is called subsurface supremacy.

=== Ownership of extracted oil and gas ===

Refined [[hydrocarbons]] that escape into the ground are not subject to the [[law of capture]], unless evidence shows that the refiner abandoned them.&lt;ref&gt;''Champlin Exploration, Inc. v. Western Bridge &amp; Steel Co., Inc.'', 597 P.2d 1215 (Okla. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Extracted oil and gas which are subsequently stored in underground reservoirs are considered as [[personal property]], rather than as an interest in real estate.&lt;ref&gt;''Texas American Energy Corporation v. Citizens Fidelity Bank &amp; Trust Company'', 736 S.W.2d 25 (Ky. 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lease ==
Oil and gas producing companies do not always own the land they drill on. Often, the company (the ''lessee'') leases the [[mineral rights]] from the owner (the ''lessor''). Major points in a lease include the description of the property, the term (duration), and the payments to the lessor.

Lessees of mineral rights have a right of reasonable access to [[lease]]d land to explore, develop, and transport minerals&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hunt Oil Co.]] v. Kerbaugh'', 283 N.W.2d 131 (N.D. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;, unless the lease specifies otherwise (a "no-surface access" lease).

===Term of the lease===
A lease remains in effect for a certain period of time, called the primary term, as long as the lessee pays the annual rental. The lease expires after the primary term, unless drilling or oil and gas production has started on the lease. If production is established, the lease will remain in effect past the primary term, as long as the lease continuously produces oil or gas. The lease can however, be revived by virtue of delay rentals. '''Delay rentals''' are fees paid to the lessor, to delay production or commencement of drilling, without terminating the lease. There are other clauses that also revive the lease.

To commence drilling a well under the [[habendum clause]] means that substantial preparations for such drilling has to be undertaken, as long as such measures have been commenced in [[good faith]] and with [[due diligence]]&lt;ref&gt;''Breaux v. Apache Oil Corp.'', 240 So. 2d 589 (La. Ct. App. 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;. The habendum clause sets out these terms, as well as most significantly, identifying the parties to the transaction and their interests in the conveyed real property.

An oil and gas lease generally includes a ''[[force majeure]]'' clause. Such agreement relieves the lessee from liability for breach, if the party's performance is impeded as the result of a natural cause that could not have been anticipated or prevented. This [[Act of God]] must completely prevent performance and must be unanticipated. Courts often construe this clause very strictly and rarely enforce it.  For example, a [[tornado]] preventing performance in [[Oklahoma]] would not trigger the ''force majeure'' clause, since tornadoes are a common occurrence in Oklahoma.

The Responsible Federal Oil and Gas Lease Act (2008), also called the "Use It or Lose It" bill ([[United States House of Representatives|HR]] 6251 IH), proposed prohibiting the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] from issuing new federal oil and gas leases to holders of existing leases who do not either diligently develop the lands subject to such existing leases or [[wikt:relinquish|relinquish]] such leases.&lt;ref&gt;http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.6251:&lt;/ref&gt;  This bill failed to pass in the House of Representatives.

===Pugh clauses===
Unless specified otherwise, establishing commercial production from a single well within the lease will hold the entire lease as long as production continues. Language to the contrary is called a Pugh clause. A Pugh clause may specify that a producing well may hold only a specified area around that well; after the primary term, the mineral owner is free to lease the rest of the land to others. 

A vertical Pugh clause limits the lease to certain depths or certain geological formations. A common form of a vertical Pugh clause limits the depths held by production from the ground surface down to the deepest producing formation established by the end of the primary term. 

===Payments===
Payments to the lessor typically take three forms:  bonus, rental, and [[royalties]], as negotiated between the parties. The bonus is an up-front payment made at the time the lease takes effect.  The rental is an annual payment, usually made until such time as the property begins producing oil or gas in commercial quantities.

The royalty is a portion of the gross value of any oil or gas produced from the lease that is paid to the mineral owner. It is not a portion of profits, for it is paid without deducting costs of drilling, completing, or operating the well. Whether or not the operator can deduct costs of treating, transporting, or marketing the oil and gas, if not specified in the lease, has been a matter of legal dispute. The traditional royalty rate for oil and gas in the United States was one-eighth (12.5 percent), although today it is often higher. Some states, such as Pennsylvania and West Virginia, have set the legal minimum royalty for private oil and gas leases to one-eighth.&lt;ref&gt;State of Pennsylvania, [http://law.psu.edu/_file/aglaw/Marcellus_Shale/Oil_and_Gas_Leases.pdf Oil and gas leases], Pennsylvania statutes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sean |last=Cassidy |url= http://www.emlf.org/clientuploads/directory/whitepaper/Cassidy_10.pdf |format=PDf |title=Division of royalty: who gets what? |work= Energy and Mineral Law Institute |year= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an "unless-delay rental" lease, a lessee agrees to pay delay rentals so long as the lessee is not drilling on the property. An "unless" oil and gas lease terminates automatically, if the lessee fails to drill within the specified time or pay the delay rentals as called for in the lease&lt;ref&gt;''Schwartenberger v. Hunt Trust Estate'', 244 N.W.2d 711 (N.D. 1976).&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Contract ==

Oil and gas [[contract]]s have nuances which differ from standard contracts. For example, when an [[Assignment (law)|assignment]] of an oil and gas lease expressly provides that any extension or renewal of the lease is subject to an overriding [[Royalties|royalty]], a new lease that is substantially similar to the first lease and procured by the assignee during the term of the first lease, is regarded, as a matter of law, as an extension of renewal of the first lease.&lt;ref&gt;''Reynolds-Rexwinkle Oil, Inc. v. Petex, Inc.'', 268 Kan. 840, 1 P.3d 909 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Statutes can override agreements made by parties. For instance, a [[statute]] may void an agreement to indemnify a construction worker as to liability for death or bodily injury incurred on an oil well, regardless of the indemnitee's [[negligence]], without affecting the validity of an insurance contract. It affirms the right of an individual party to obtain insurance, not to protect the interests of the indemnitee.&lt;ref&gt;''Amoco Production Co. v. Action Well Service, Inc.'', 107 N.M. 208, 755 P.2d 52 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; These suits for negligence are typically brought by drilling site workers known as [[roustabout]]s.

The two most common contractual agreements entered into by oil and gas companies are the [[Farmout_agreement|Farmout Agreement]] and the Joint Operating Agreement. A farmout agreement, generally, is between one company that owns a lease, and another company that wishes to drill the property. The company wishing to drill, called the farmee, provides drilling services in exchange for a majority interest in the lease owned by the farmor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brister|first=Austin|title=Farmout Agreements: The Basics, Negotiations and Motivations|url=http://www.oilandgaslawdigest.com/ogagreements/farmout-agreements-basics-negotiations-motivations/|publisher=Oil and Gas Law Digest|accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Joint operations===
In some cases, oil and gas rights or leases in a drilling unit are held by more than one company or person who wish to participate in drilling and production. In such cases, the various interests sign a Joint Operating Agreement, a contract entered into by two or more ownership or leasehold co-tenants to jointly explore and develop the oil and gas property, including operations, voting mechanisms, subsequent operations, risk-sharing, indemnities and exculpatory provisions, revenue allocation, title examination and title issues, and future acquisitions and divestitures in the contract area. One company is designated as the operator, and operates the property on a day-to-day basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brister|first=Austin|title=Introduction to Joint Operating Agreements|url=http://www.oilandgaslawdigest.com/back-to-basics/introduction-joint-operating-agreements/|publisher=Oil and Gas Law Digest|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various terms describing ownership interests in an oil or gas well. An interest signifying a duty to pay expenses is called:
*'''Working Interest''': the share of well drilling or operating expenses paid. The owner of a working interest will also own a corresponding, but usually lower, net revenue interest.

Interests in receiving income include:
*'''Net Revenue Interest''': the share of income received, connected to a working interest
*'''Royalty Interest''': the share of income received, unrelated to a working interest, and therefore received without paying any well expenses; usually connected to a leased mineral ownership. When a mineral owner signs a lease, he receives a royalty interest.
*'''Overriding Royalty Interest''': a share of income received, unconnected to either mineral ownership or working interest. A person or company may receive an overriding royalty by a contract with an owner of a net revenue interest.  This is typically received for performing some service for working interest owners. The original owner of an oil and gas lease will sometimes retain an overriding royalty as part of a farmout agreement. 

For any oil and gas property, the total working interests must add up to 100%. The sum of the net revenue interests, royalty interests, and overriding royalty interests, must also add up to 100%.

== In education and practice ==

[[Law school|Law school classes]] teaching oil and gas law generally require that students first take a class in property and contract law.  In [[Texas]] and [[Wyoming]], oil and gas law is tested on the [[bar examination|bar exam]].

Oil and gas law [[Lawyer|practitioners]] usually fall into three broad categories.  First, oil and gas companies usually have in-house attorneys that advise the company of its rights and the legal issues. These attorneys are usually assisted by  [[landman (oil worker)|landmen]], who examine property titles, land oil and gas rights, and acquire property for the company. Landmen may be lawyers themselves. Second, practitioners may represent private parties.  When an oil company attempts to obtain land from a private party, a party may retain counsel to be better informed of his or her rights and to negotiate a favorable bargain with the oil company. Last, oil and gas attorneys work for federal and state governments that oversee energy and environmental policy and land acquisitions.

There are several not-for-profit foundations that exist to further the practical and scholarly study of oil and gas law, for example the [[Energy and Mineral Law Foundation]] and the [[Rocky Mountain Mineral Law Foundation]].

==Regulation==

Regulation of oil and gas drilling and production are largely left to the states, except for federal offshore waters, where operations are regulated by the [[Bureau of Ocean Energy Management]]. The names and organizational structures of the state agencies overseeing oil and gas extraction vary. In Texas, oil and gas are regulated by the [[Texas Railroad Commission]], in Oklahoma by the [[Oklahoma Corporation Commission]], and in North Dakota by the Industrial Commission. In Colorado and Wyoming, the agencies are the state Oil and Gas Conservation Commissions.

Local control of oil and gas operations is contentious. The key legal issue is generally whether, or to what extent, state regulations preempt local controls. The result varies state-to-state.

States require a drilling permit before a well begins drilling. Requirements to receive drilling permits generally include minimum setbacks from lease or unit boundaries, and adequate casing and cementing programs. 

States generally require permits for or notices of major work done on a well, and periodic reports of oil and gas produced.

When a well reaches the end of economic production, it must be plugged according to the terms of a plugging permit.

Where the onshore oil and gas rights are owned by the federal government, as is the case for much land in the western United States, the various permits must also be obtained from the [[Bureau of Land Management]] as well as the state, which may have different requirements than the equivalent state permits.

Many of Open Knowledge International's projects are technical in nature. Its most prominent project, [[CKAN]], is used by many of the world's governments to host open catalogues of data that their countries possess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=data.gov.uk|title=Project Info: Who is Involved with the project?|url=http://data.gov.uk/about/|publisher=HM Government|quote=These include the Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network (CKAN): CKAN stores the catalogue behind data.gov.uk and a growing number of open data registries around the world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation tends to support its aims by hosting infrastructure for semi-independent projects to develop. This approach to organising was hinted as one of its earliest projects was a project management service called KnowledgeForge, which runs on the [[KForge]] platform. ''KnowledgeForge'' allows sectoral [[working group]]s to have space to manage projects related to open knowledge. More widely, the project infrastructure includes both technical and [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] aspects. The organisation hosts several dozen mailing lists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Open Knowledge Foundation|title = lists.okfn.org Mailing Lists|url = http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo|accessdate = 1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for virtual discussion, utilises [[IRC]] for real-time communications and also hosts events.

=== Advocacy ===

Open Knowledge International is an active partner with organisations working in similar areas, such as open educational resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Open Educational Resources Commons|title = About|url = http://www.oercommons.org/about|accessdate = 1 November 2015|quote = Strategic Development and Outreach Partners ... Open Knowledge Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open Knowledge International has produced the [[Open Knowledge Definition]], an attempt to clarify some of the ambiguity surrounding the terminology of openness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://opendefinition.org/|title = Open Definition|publisher = Open Definition|date = 2011-06-17|accessdate = 1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Open Software Service Definition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blog.okfn.org/2008/07/14/open-software-service-definition-launched/|title = Open Software Service Definition Launched|accessdate = 1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also supported the development of the [[Open Database License]] (ODbL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Creative Commons|title = CC Salon Berlin and openeverything focus – Feb. 26|url = https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12919|accessdate = 29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of technology, Open Knowledge International plays a role in advocating for openness broadly. This includes supporting the drafting of reports, facilitating consultation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Open Society Foundations|title = Public Feedback Solicited on Access to Information and Open Government Data|url = http://www.soros.org/initiatives/information/focus/communication/news/access-consultation-20100910|accessdate = 1 November 2015|date = September 2010|quote = Information Program grantee Access Info Europe, together with the Open Knowledge Foundation, are holding a public consultation on open government data and the right of access to information.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Electronic Frontier Foundation|title = Digital Rights Management: A failure in the developed world, a danger to the developing world|url = https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-rights-management-failure-developed-world-danger-developing-world|accessdate = 1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and producing guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Dietrich|first = Daniel|title = Open Data Manual|url = http://opendatamanual.org/|accessdate = 1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rufus Pollock, one of Open Knowledge International's founders, and current board secretary sits on the [[UK government]]'s [[Public Sector Transparency Board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = data.govt.uk|title = New Public Sector Transparency Board and Public Data Transparency Principles|url = http://data.gov.uk/blog/new-public-sector-transparency-board-and-public-data-transparency-principles|publisher = HM Government|accessdate = 1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technical ===
[[File:Geo-datos.jpeg|frame|Banner for the [[Geodata]] project in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]]][[File:OpenGLAM Logo.svg|thumb|OpenGLAM logo]]
The foundation places a strong interest in the use of [[open source]] technologies. Its software projects are hosted on [[GitHub]], which utilises the [[Git (software)|Git]] [[version control software]]. Some of the projects are listed below:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.okfn.org/projects|title = projects - The Open Knowledge Foundation|accessdate = 1 November 2015}} Open Knowledge Projects&lt;/ref&gt;

* CKAN, a tool that provides store for metadata. This enables governments to quickly and cheaply provide a catalogue of their data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Feature Tour {{!}} ckan            - The open source data portal software|url = http://ckan.org/features/|website = ckan.org|accessdate = 1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the type of data (and its conditions of use), Datahub may also be able to store a copy of the data or host it in a database, and provide some basic visualisation tools.
* Open bibliography, broadly construed as efforts to catalogue and build tools for working with and publishing bibliographic resources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/inf11/jiscexpo/jiscopenbib.aspx|title = Open Bibliography|publisher = JISC|accessdate = 1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://openbiblio.net/|title = Open bibliography and Open Bibliographic Data &amp;#124; Open Bibliographic Data Working Group of the Open Knowledge Foundation|work = Openbiblio.net|accessdate = 1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with particular emphasis on those works that are in the [[public domain]] and [[public domain calculators]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17039">'''''Operation Backfire''''' is a multi-agency criminal investigation, led by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), into destructive acts in the name of [[animal rights]] and environmental causes in the United States described as [[eco-terrorism]] by the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/speeches/mueller012006.htm Federal Bureau of Investigation - Major Executive Speeches - January 20, 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409123308/https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/speeches/mueller012006.htm |date=April 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The operation resulted in convictions and imprisonment of a number of domestic terrorists, many of which were members of the [[Animal Liberation Front]] and [[Earth Liberation Front]].

== Background ==
In 2004 the FBI merged seven independent investigations from its [[Portland, Oregon]] field office and called them ''Operation Backfire''. According to an agency statement, the operational focus is on investigating acts of [[domestic terrorism]], carried out on behalf of two activist groups, the [[Earth Liberation Front]] (ELF) and [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/page2/jan06/elf012006.htm Federal Bureau of Investigation - Press Room - Headline Archives - Eco-Terror Indictments] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060308152116/https://www.fbi.gov/page2/jan06/elf012006.htm |date=March 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arrests ==
In December 2005 and January 2006, with assistance from the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF), the FBI [[indicted]] six women and seven men on a total of 65 charges, including [[arson]], conspiracy, use of destructive devices, and destruction of an energy facility. The defendants were named as Joseph Mahmoud Dibee]], Chelsea Dawn Gerlach, Sarah Kendall Harvey (née Kendall Tankersley), [[Daniel G. McGowan|Daniel McGowan]], Stanislas Meyerhoff, Josephine Sunshine Overaker, Jonathan Paul, Rebecca Jeanette Rubin, Suzanne Savoie, Justin Franchi Solondz, [[Darren Thurston]], Kevin Tubbs, and Briana Waters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/page2/jan06/elf012006.htm Eco-terror Indictments -  'Operation Backfire' Nets 11] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817222138/https://www.fbi.gov/page2/jan06/elf012006.htm |date=August 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other unindicted co-conspirators were also named. A 13th alleged co-conspirator, [[William C. Rodgers|William "Bill" Rodgers]], also known as Avalon, committed [[suicide]] while in police custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indybay.org/archives/archive_by_id.php?id=3945&amp;category_id=14 |title=Eco-Defense Arrestee Bill Rodgers Found Dead in Cell in Arizona |publisher=Indybay.org |date=2005-12-22 |accessdate=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2006, a number of self-described ELF members pleaded guilty to arson and other charges in U.S. federal courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.oregonlive.com/newsflash/regional/index.ssf?/base/news-17/1166084876304650.xml&amp;storylist=orlocal | work=The Oregonian | title=Sign in to OregonLive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 11, 2006, Joyanna Zacher, Nathan Block, Daniel McGowan and Jonathan Paul pleaded guilty to several eco-sabotage related charges, as part of a global resolution agreement with prosecutors. Judge Ann Aiken presided over the hearings. The change of pleas from the four defendants resolves all current "Operation Backfire" cases in Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.interactivist.net/article.pl?sid=06/11/14/1649245 Notes from Oregon Eco-Sabotage Plea Hearings | Interactivist Info Exchange&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, 2006, Chelsea Dawn Gerlach and Stanislas Gregory Meyerhoff, pleaded guilty to $20 million worth of arsons committed between 1996 and 2001 by the Eugene-based cell of the ELF known as "The Family". Their fire-bombing of a Vail ski resort resulted in damages totaling $12 million, with the FBI characterizing the ELF as the United States' "top domestic terrorism threat".  Gerlach has previously pleaded guilty to 18 counts of arson in other attacks, saying she was motivated by "a deep sense of despair and anger at the deteriorating state of the global environment," but adding that she has "since realized the firebombings did more harm than good."  Meyerhoff has renounced ELF and pleaded guilty to 54 counts, but is still under indictment in Michigan, Arizona, Washington, Wyoming and California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freenewmexican.com/news/53743.html Two plead guilty in 1998 Vail ski resort fire] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210543/http://www.freenewmexican.com/news/53743.html |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==
The indictments of the 18 activists for alleged acts of [[eco-terrorism]] have drawn condemnation from activists and alternative media organizations. The [[National Lawyers Guild]] condemned the operation and the resulting indictments, arguing that "life sentences for property damage offenses where the actor has no intent to harm an individual are simply unconstitutional."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Azadeh Shahshahani, President |url=http://www.nlg.org/news/statements/greenscare2006.htm |title=National Lawyers Guild |publisher=Nlg.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714131330/http://www.nlg.org/news/statements/greenscare2006.htm|archivedate=July 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal liberation activist and physician [[Jerry Vlasak]] accused the FBI of targeting "a bunch of above-ground, well-known, peaceful animal-rights activists and environmental activists and charg[ing] them with being members of the ALF and the ELF."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0130/p20s01-sten.html |title=Backstory: Eco-vigilantes: All in 'The Family?' |publisher=csmonitor.com |date=2006-01-30 |accessdate=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, then-U.S. Attorney General [[Alberto R. Gonzales]] argued that "there's a clear difference between constitutionally protected advocacy — which is the right of all Americans — and violent criminal activity."&lt;ref name="arizona.indymedia.org" /&gt;

'''Directive 2012/28/EU''' is a [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] of the [[European Parliament]] and [[European Council]] enacted on 25 October 2012 that pertains to certain uses of [[orphan works]].&lt;ref name="Directive 2012/28/EU"&gt;{{cite web|title=Orphan works|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/orphan_works/index_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The directive sets out common rules on the digitisation and online display of orphan works.&lt;ref name="Directive 2012/28/EU"&gt;{{cite web|title=Orphan works|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/orphan_works/index_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a diligent search has been completed a work can be registered at the orphan works register of the European Union Intellectual Property Office. Registering a work at that database allows for certain permitted uses of that work by cultural heritage institutions.

==Basis==

Orphan works are works like books, newspaper articles, or films, which may be protected under [[copyright]] but for which the copyright holder cannot be found. A substantial portion of the collections of Europe's cultural institutions are orphan works (e.g. the British Library estimates that 40 per cent of its copyrighted collections, 150 million works in total, are orphan works).&lt;ref name="European Commission Memo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Memo – Orphan works – FAQ|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-12-743_en.htm?locale=en|work=europa.eu|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orphan works are not available for legal use by filmmakers, archivists, writers, musicians, and broadcasters. Public libraries, educational institutions and museums, that digitise old manuscripts, books, sound recordings and film, may choose to not digitise orphan works, or make orphan works available to the public,&lt;ref name= Netanel&gt;{{Cite book| last= Netanel| first= Neil| title= Copyright's paradox| publisher= Oxford University Press US| year= 2008| page= 200| url= https://www.google.com/books?id=vo9G-0iZNQIC&amp;dq=orphan+works&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =978-0-19-513762-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for fear that a re-appearing rights-holder may sue them for damages.&lt;ref name= Borgman&gt;{{Cite book| last= Borgman| first= Christine L.| title= Scholarship in the digital age: information, infrastructure, and the internet| publisher= MIT Press| year= 2007| page= 108| url= http://Google.com/books?id=ZDDu3CuzDdMC&amp;dq=orphan+works+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn= 978-0-262-02619-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU has set out large-scale digitisation programs (such as [[Europeana]]) and in order for these programs to be successful, common rules on how to deal with orphan works need to be established.&lt;ref name="European Commission Memo" /&gt;

==Works Covered by the Directive==

This directive applies to the following orphan works that were created in the EU:

* printed works (books, journals, magazines and newspapers)
* [[cinematographic]] and audio-visual works
* [[Sound recording|phonogram]]s
* works embedded or incorporated in other works or phonograms (e.g. pictures in a book)

Under certain conditions, the directive can also apply to unpublished works (such as letters or manuscripts).&lt;ref name="European Commission Memo" /&gt;
If orphaned software and video games ("[[Abandonware]]") fall under the ''audiovisual works'' definition is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiig.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Maier_JIPITEC-2015-120_Games-as-cultural-heritage.pdf|title=Games as Cultural Heritage Copyright Challenges for Preserving (Orphan) Video Games in the EU |accessdate=18 January 2016 |first=Henrike |last=Maier |publisher=[[Humboldt Universität zu Berlin]] |date=2015 |format=PDF |work=JIPITEC |pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==

The directive provides regulations on how to identify orphan works. An organisation that wishes to digitise a work in question has to conduct a scrupulous search to find its copyright holder. In this search, it should rely on sources such as databases and registries like ARROW&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arrow-net.eu&lt;/ref&gt; for text and image-based works. A registry for [[orphan film]] is currently developed by ACE – [[Association of European Film Archives and Cinematheques]] in the FORWARD project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.project-forward.eu&lt;/ref&gt; A diligent search guideline and tool has also been developed by the EnDOW project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heritageportal.eu/News-Events/Latest-News/EnDOW-Heritage-Plus-Project-Profile.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Its [http://diligentsearch.eu/ tool] for diligent searches is available for 20 European Union Member states. It is hoped that other sectors will develop similar information databases.&lt;ref name="European Commission Memo" /&gt;

The directive also establishes that if a search does not find the identity or location of the copyright holder, the work shall be officially recognised as an orphan work. This status shall be valid for the whole of the [[European Union]], which means the organisation will be able to make it available online in all Member States. The directive also foresees the establishment of a single European registry of all recognised orphan works that will be set up and run by [[European Union Intellectual Property Office|EUIPO]], the European Union Intellectual Property Office based in [[Alicante]].&lt;ref name="European Commission Memo" /&gt;

Works identified as orphan works can be used by beneficiary organisations to achieve aims related to their public interest mission. They will be allowed to conclude public-private partnerships with commercial operators and to generate revenues from the use of orphan works to cover digitisation costs.&lt;ref name="European Commission Memo" /&gt;

Under this directive, a reappearing copyright-holder can assert his/her copyright and thereby end the orphan work status.&lt;ref name="European Commission Memo" /&gt;

Pearson filed suit against Soo Chung, Jin Nam Chung, and Ki Y.

== Lawsuit ==
Pearson sued a D.C. [[dry cleaning]] establishment, Custom Cleaners, for over $67 million for the loss of a pair of pants. On May 3, 2005, Pearson allegedly left a pair of gray pants that could be distinguished by a unique trio of belt loops on both sides of the front waistband. After a delay due to the pants being mistakenly sent to another dry cleaners, the pants were offered back completed several days after May 5, 2005, the initial pickup date. Pearson refused to accept the pants, claiming they were not his, despite confirmation by the cleaners' records, tags, and Pearson's receipt. Pearson demanded what he claimed to be the price of the pants as compensation, an amount of over $1000, which the Chungs refused. As a result, Pearson filed suit in the [[Superior Court of the District of Columbia|District of Columbia's Superior Court]]. The judge to whom the case was presented decided to bring it to trial on the basis of two of Pearson's claims. The first claim was the issue of the ownership by Pearson of the presented pair of pants. The second claim was on the issue of signs posted outside the business, advertising "Same Day Service" and "Satisfaction Guaranteed," which Pearson claimed to be misleading.&lt;ref name='Manning Sossamon'&gt;{{cite news|last=Manning |first=Christopher |publisher=Manning Sossamon |title=The Facts of Pearson V.

Over time, the Chungs presented three settlement offers in the amounts of $3000, $4600, and $12,000—all of which were rejected by Pearson. [[Superior Court of the District of Columbia|D.C. Superior Court]] Judge Neal Kravitz stated that "the court has significant concerns that the plaintiff is acting in [[Bad faith#In law|bad faith]]."  The judge resolved some of the issues in the Chungs' favor in response to their [[Summary judgment#United States|motion for summary judgment]] (which was filed at the close of [[Discovery (law)|discovery]]), but could not dismiss the case because some facts were in dispute.

The owners of the business, [[South Korea]]n immigrants Jin Nam Chung, Soo Chung, and their son, Ki Chung, were reportedly considering moving back to South Korea.&lt;ref name=lawsuit&gt;{{cite news |last=[[Associated Press]] |title=54 million dollars lawsuit against South Korean dry cleaner over pair of trousers is in full swing |url=http://english.pravda.ru/news/world/21-06-2007/93815-lawsuit-0/ |accessdate=June 30, 2016 |newspaper=pravda.ru |date=21 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an outpouring of support for the Chungs from members of the public, a website was set up to accept donations for the Chungs' legal defense.&lt;ref name=defensefund&gt;{{cite web|title=Custom Cleaners Defense Fund |url=http://www.customcleanersdefensefund.com/ |accessdate=2007-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070605221200/http://www.customcleanersdefensefund.com/ |archivedate=June 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 30, 2007, Pearson reduced his demands to $54 million in damages rather than $67 million. Among his requests were $500,000 in attorney's fees, $2 million for "discomfort, inconvenience, and [[Negligent infliction of emotional distress|mental distress]]," and $15,000, which he claimed would be the cost to rent a car every weekend to drive to another dry cleaning service. The remaining $51.5 million would be used to help similarly dissatisfied D.C. consumers sue businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/13/AR2007061302033.html |title=Wearing Down the Judicial System with a Pair of Pants |date=June 14, 2007 |accessdate=June 30, 2016 |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |first=Marc |last=Fisher}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/rawfisher/2007/06/pants_extra_inside_the_courtro.html |title=Pants Extra: Inside the Courtroom |date=June 14, 2007 |accessdate=2007-06-14 |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511221852/http://blog.washingtonpost.com/rawfisher/2007/06/pants_extra_inside_the_courtro.html |archivedate=May 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearson also re-focused his lawsuit from the missing pants to  the removal of window signs for "Satisfaction Guaranteed" and "Same Day Service." Pearson claimed the signs represented [[Fraud#United States|fraud]] on the part of the Chungs. The Chungs' lawyer, Christopher Manning, alleged that the signs could only be considered fraud if a [[reasonable person]] would be misled by them, and that a reasonable person would not see the signs as an unconditional promise. The Chungs' lawyer portrayed Pearson as a bitter, financially insolvent man; under questioning, Pearson admitted that, at the start of the court case, he had only $1000–2000 in the bank due to divorce proceedings, and was collecting unemployment benefits.

=== Trial ===
On June 12, 2007, the trial began. Pearson broke down in tears during an explanation about his frustration after losing his pants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2007/06/14/DI2007061401447.html |title=Pants Lawsuit |date=June 15, 2007 |accessdate=June 30, 2016 |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |first=Emil |last=Steiner}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a short recess had to be declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/12/AR2007061201667.html?hpid=moreheadlines |title=Judge Who Seeks Millions for Lost Pants Has His (Emotional) Day in Court |date=June 13, 2007 |accessdate=June 30, 2016 |quote=Before trial began yesterday in the case of the D.C. judge who sued his neighborhood dry cleaners after they lost his pants, the most extraordinary fact was Roy Pearson's demand for $65 million in damages.

It was before an 89-year-old woman in a wheelchair told of being chased out of the cleaners by an angry owner. And it was before she compared the owners of Custom Cleaners in open court to Nazis. |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |first=Marc |last=Fisher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decision ===
On June 25, 2007, the trial ended with District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Judith Bartnoff ruling in favor of the dry cleaners, and awarding them [[court costs]] pursuant to a [[motion (legal)|motion]] which the Chungs later withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Administrative Law Judge Loses $54 Million Pants Lawsuit |quote=A D.C.

=== Post-trial motions and appeal ===
Pearson made a motion on July 11, 2007, to reconsider in the trial court, stating that he felt the judge had "committed a [[Coram nobis|fundamental legal error]]," and had failed to address his legal claims.&lt;ref name="CBC712"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=CBC.CA | title=Customer pursues $54M lawsuit against dry cleaners |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/customer-pursues-54m-lawsuit-against-dry-cleaners-1.677215 |date=2007-07-12 |accessdate=June 30, 2016 |work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pearson stated he believed the court had imposed its own conditional interpretation of "satisfaction guaranteed," rather than what Pearson believes is an offer of unconditional and unambiguous satisfaction.  The court denied the motion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wusa9.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=60842 WUSA9.com | Washington, DC | Judge Refuses To Reconsider Ruling In Pants Case&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203608/http://www.wusa9.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=60842 |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was revealed on August 2, 2007 that a panel recommended Pearson not be given a ten-year term as an administrative law judge after his initial two-year term expired mid-2007, in part because his suit against Mr. Chung demonstrated a lack of "judicial temperament." Pearson was appointed in 2005 and stood to lose his $100,512 salary if a hearing upheld that decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/rawfisher/2007/08/first_pants_man_loses_case_nex.html |title=First, Pants Man Loses Case.

Roy Pearson filed suit against Washington, D.C. on May 2, 2008, claiming that he had been wrongfully dismissed for exposing corruption within the Office of Administrative Hearings. Pearson sought $1 million in compensation for lost wages and [[Punitive damages#United States|punitive damages]] as well as his job back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |author=Emil Steiner |title=Roy Pearson's Latest Lawsuit |url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/offbeat/2008/05/roy_pearson_suing_district_to.html |date=2008-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706044629/http://blog.washingtonpost.com/offbeat/2008/05/roy_pearson_suing_district_to.html |archivedate=July 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 23, 2009, federal district judge [[Ellen Segal Huvelle]] dismissed Pearson's May 2008 lawsuit, ruling the District of Columbia had not broken the law by declining to reappoint him as an administrative law judge.

The Chungs moved to recover $83,000 in attorneys' fees and to impose sanctions, but withdrew the motion after recovering their costs through fund-raising. The Chungs stated that they did so in the hopes of persuading Pearson to stop litigating,&lt;ref name=Cauvin&gt;{{cite news |title=Judge Who Filed Suit Plans to Appeal Defeat |author=Henri E.

On July 24, 2007, the [[American Tort Reform Association]] and the [[Institute for Legal Reform]] of the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]] hosted a fundraiser for the Chungs to help pay their attorneys fees that reported having raised up to $64,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chungfundraiser.com/ Support the Chungs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705124926/http://www.chungfundraiser.com/ |date=July 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chungs say they have received close to $100,000 from supporters to cover their attorneys' fees and lost business.&lt;ref name=Cauvin/&gt;

On September 19, 2007, citing a loss of revenue and emotional strain from the lawsuit, the Chungs announced they had closed and sold the dry cleaning shop involved in the dispute. The Chungs still owned one additional dry cleaning shop and said they would be focusing their attention and resources on their remaining shop.&lt;ref name="abc_01"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/national_world&amp;id=5665422 | title= Dry Cleaner in Pants Suit Closes (Associated Press) | date= September 19, 2007 | accessdate= 2011-06-25 | work= Action News 6abc.com | publisher= [[WPVI-TV|WPVI-TV Philadelphia, PA]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Järvelaid is a professor in the [[University of Tallinn]].&lt;ref&gt;http://law.tlu.ee/gb/39&lt;/ref&gt; He has developed semiotic and personality-centered research direction, writing hundreds of articles mostly about the European and Estonian legal history and education, published in Estonian, English, German, French, Russian, Latvian, Finnish, Lithuanian and Swedish. Since 2006 his studies have been increasingly concentrated on the international relations in the 20th century, which among others has required intensive archival researches in German and Polish archives. Since 2012 Järvelaid has placed his research emphasis on the German diplomatic missions, with a specific interest in German diplomatic representation in Tallinn.

He then moved to the [[University Nord]], which later evolved into the Tallinn University Law School in 2010, where he was Professor of Law, Head of Studies and Dean. In 1997-2000, Järvelaid was the advisor to the [[Estonian Ministry of Justice]]; he also has been the Rector of the [[Estonian Academy of Security Sciences]] (2003-2005) and the [[Estonian Maritime Academy]] (2006-2007).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

[[File:2017-us-green-card-specimen.png|thumb|Sample of a 2017 [[lawful permanent residents (United States)|permanent resident card]] (green card) of the [[United States]], which permits its holder to live and work anywhere in the country similar to that of all other [[Americans]]. Before a person is naturalized as a [[citizenship of the United States|U.S. citizen]], they must be a green card holder for at least 5 years and satisfy all other naturalization requirements.&lt;ref name="LPR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Green Card"/&gt;]]
'''Permanent residency''' refers to a person's [[residency (domicile)|resident]] status in a country of which they are not a [[citizenship|citizen]]. This is usually for an indefinite period; a person with such status is known as a permanent resident.

Permanent residency itself is distinct from [[right of abode]], which waives immigration control for such persons. Persons having permanent residency still require immigration control if they do not have right of abode. However, a right of abode automatically grants people permanent residency. This status also gives [[work permit]] in most cases.&lt;ref name="LPR"/&gt;

==Countries with permanent residency systems==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2009}}
Not every country allows permanent residency. Rights and application may vary widely.

All European Union countries have a facility for someone to become a permanent resident, as EU legislation allows an EU national who moves to another EU country to attain permanent resident status after residing there for five years. The European Union also sets out permanent residency rights for [[Long-term resident (European Union)|long-term resident]] third country nationals under directive (2003/109/EC). A novel approach was the granting of rights across the national borders of states adhering to the directive.

Other countries have varying forms of such residency and relationships with other countries with regards to permanent residency.

===Other forms of permanent residency===
* India does not permit dual citizenship, but former Indian citizens, and persons of Indian origin, are eligible to apply for an ''[[Overseas Citizen of India]] (OCI)'' card that allows them to live and work freely in India, apart from running for certain political office posts and occupying constitutional posts. They also cannot vote or buy agricultural land. Spouses who have no other connection to India other than being married to someone with or eligible for OCI can also apply for OCI if they have been married for at least two years. Once the marriage is dissolved, OCI status is automatically lost for spouse with no connection to India. Recently in 2016 India allowed Permanent Resident Status to foreigners with some conditions.
* Turkey allows dual citizenship, and former Turkish citizens who have given up their Turkish citizenship (for example, because they have naturalized in a country that usually does not permit dual citizenship, such as Germany, Austria, South Korea or Japan) can apply for the "Blue Card" (''mavi kart''), which gives them some citizens' rights back, e.g. the right to live and work in Turkey, the right to possess land or the right to inherit, but not the right to vote.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* Some countries have made '''treaties regulating travel and access to the job markets (non-government/non-military-related work)''': A citizen of an EU country can live and work indefinitely in other EU countries and in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland (and citizens of these countries can live and work in EU countries). The [[Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement]] between Australia and New Zealand allows citizens of the two countries to live and work in the other country. A citizen of a [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] (GCC) member state (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates) can live and work in other member states.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
: However, for voting, being voted and working for the public sector or the national security in a country, citizenship of the country concerned is almost always required.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==== Golden Visas ==== 
A "[[golden visa]]" is a permanent residency visa issued to individuals who invest, often through the purchase of property, a certain sum of money into the issuing county. Dating back to the 1980s, golden visas became much more popular and available in the 21st century. Golden visas require investments of anywhere from $100,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldenvisas.com/dominica/]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Dominica]] up to £2,000,000 in the U.K.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldenvisas.com/uk/]&lt;/ref&gt; The most common method for obtaining a golden visa is through the purchase of real estate with a minimum value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ceciliarodriguez/2013/09/29/want-to-live-in-europe-buy-a-residency-permit/ |title=Want To Live In Europe? "Buy" A Residency Permit |website=Forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries such as Malta and Cyprus also offer "[[golden passports]]" (citizenship) to individuals if they invest a certain sum.&lt;ref&gt;Where is the cheapest place to buy citizenship?, By Kim Gittleson BBC reporter, New York, 4 June 2014, https://www.bbc.com/news/business-27674135&lt;/ref&gt;

The issuing of so-called "golden visas" has sparked controversy in several countries.&lt;ref&gt;Canada kills investor visa popular with Chinese, by Sophia Yan   @sophia_yan March 25, 2014: 2:21 AM ET , CNN, [http://money.cnn.com/2014/02/12/news/canada-chinese-immigration/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21633854-schemes-effect-sell-visas-rich-foreigners-come-under-fire-buying-their-way Buying their way in, Economist 22 november 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations of permanent residents ==
Depending on the country, permanent residents usually have the same rights as citizens except for the following:
* they may not [[vote]] (though in some cases such as the UK's [[Commonwealth citizen]]s, New Zealand and Belgium, voting is allowed)
* they may not stand for [[public office]] (except [[European Union]] citizens permanently residing in other EU member states who may stand in local and European elections)
* in most cases they may not hold [[public sector]] employment. Canada and New Zealand allow this; some countries, such as Brazil and Portugal, allow it only for permanent residents holding citizenship of another country of [[colonialism|shared heritage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto/D70391.htm |title=D70391 |website=Planalto.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* they may not usually apply for employment involving [[national security]]. In Singapore, male PRs who have been granted PR before the age of 18 have to serve [[national service]]. Most first-generation males are exempted.
* they may not own certain classes of [[real estate]]
* they are not issued the [[passport]] of that country (unless otherwise stateless or unable to obtain a passport from their country of nationality, in which case they may be entitled to a [[certificate of identity]] instead)
* they do not have access to the country's [[consul (representative)|consul]]ar protection (some countries such as Australia allow this)&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111127063444/http://www.smartraveller.gov.au/services/consular-services-charter.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzembassy.com/iran/new-zealanders-overseas/embassy-services-new-zealanders |title=Embassies &amp;#124; New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade |website=Nzembassy.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* they may qualify to [[naturalisation|apply for citizenship]] after meeting a specified period of residence

== Obligations of permanent residents ==
Permanent residents may be required to fulfil specific residence obligations to maintain their status. In some cases, permanent residency may be conditional on a certain type of employment or maintenance of a business.

Many countries have compulsory [[conscription|military service]] for citizens.  Some countries, such as Singapore, extend this to permanent residents.  However, in Singapore, most first generation permanent residents are exempted, and only their sons are held liable for NS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatexperience.sg/moving-singapore/singapore-permanent-residency |title=Singapore Permanent Residency |work=Expat Experience Singapore |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215205030/http://www.expatexperience.sg/moving-singapore/singapore-permanent-residency/ |archivedate=2015-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar approach, the United States has [[Selective Service]], a compulsory ''registration'' for military service, which is required of all male citizens and permanent residents ages 18 to 26; this requirement theoretically applies even to those residing in the country illegally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sss.gov/QA.HTM#quest7 |title=Selective Service Systems &gt; Home |website=Sss.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications for citizenship may be denied or otherwise impeded if the applicant cannot prove having complied with this requirement.

Permanent residents may be required to reside in the country offering them residence for a given minimum length of time (as in Australia and Canada). Permanent residents may lose their status if they stay outside their host country for more than a specified  period of time (as in the United States).

Permanent residents have the same obligations as citizens regarding taxes.

== Loss of status ==
Permanent residents may lose their status if they fail to comply with [[Residency (domicile)|residency]] or other obligations imposed on them. For example:
* they leave the country beyond a maximum number of days (varies among countries but usually more than 2 years)
* they become a threat to national security, or they commit serious crimes and become subject to deportation or removal from the country

== Access to citizenship ==
Usually permanent residents may apply for citizenship by [[naturalization]] after a period of permanent residency (typically five years) in the country concerned.
[[Dual citizenship]] may or may not be permitted.

In many nations an application for naturalization can be denied on character grounds, sometimes allowing people to reside in the country (as non-domiciled) but not become citizens. In the United States the residency requirements for citizenship are normally five years, even though permanent residents who have been married to a US citizen for three years or more may apply in three years. Those who have served in the armed forces may qualify for an expedited process allowing citizenship after only one year, or even without any residence requirement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uscis.gov/policymanual/HTML/PolicyManual-Volume12-PartD.html General Naturalization Requirements] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307173800/https://www.uscis.gov/policymanual/HTML/PolicyManual-Volume12-PartD.html |date=March 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Golden Passports===
Since the 1990s, in addition to [[golden visa]]s some countries have begun to offer [[golden passport]]s to foreign nationals who invest (often through the purchase of property) a certain sum into the issuing country's economy.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Citizenship, Ayelet Shachar, Chapter 35, Citizenship For Sale?, pg. 790, Oxford University Press, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The issuing of EU passports by [[Malta]] and [[Cyprus]] has sparked controversy but is expected to produced billions of euros in revenue for the issuing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Malta’s golden passport scheme draws fresh criticism, Concerns centre on selection of Jersey consultancy to run operation targeted at the wealthy, FT.com, https://www.ft.com/content/6f98892e-fbf3-11e5-b3f6-11d5706b613b&lt;/ref&gt;

== Automatic entitlement ==
Full permanent residence rights are granted automatically between the following:
* Ireland and the United Kingdom including general election voting rights.
* the states of the [[Nordic Council]]
* [[Russian Federation]] and [[Republic of Belarus]]

In some cases (e.g., the member states of the [[European Union]]) citizens of participating countries can live and work at will in each other's states, but don't have a status fully equivalent to that of a permanent resident. In particular, under the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement, Australia and New Zealand grant each other's citizens the right to reside permanently and work in each country; however, the rights and entitlements of New Zealanders living in Australia under this arrangement (the so-called [[Special Category Visa]]) are somewhat short of those of [[Australian permanent resident]]s, in particular with respect to unemployment benefits and similar benefits.

==Proof of permanent residency==
People who are granted permanent residency in a country are usually issued some sort of documentary evidence as legal proof of this status. In the past, many countries merely stamped the person's passport indicating that the holder was admitted as a permanent resident or that he/she was exempt from immigration control and permitted to work without restriction. Other countries would issue a photo ID card, place a visa sticker or certificate of residence in the person's passport, or issue a letter to confirm their permanent resident status.

In Australia and New Zealand, a printout of permanent residence visa or resident visa is stuck to a page of the permanent resident's passport. 
(On 1 September 2015, Australia ceased issuing visa labels to holders of Australian visas.) &lt;ref&gt;https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/aboutyourvisa&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, permanent residents are issued a photo ID card known as Permanent Resident Card.

In Costa Rica, permanent residents are issued a photo ID card commonly referred to as a "cedula".

In the countries of the European Union, [[Residence card (European Union)|residency permits are a photo ID card]] following a common EU design.

In Germany, resident permits ''([[German residence permit|Aufenthaltstitel]])'' have been issued as photo ID cards following a common EU design since 1 September 2011. Prior to that date, residence permits were stickers (similar to visas) which were affixed to the resident's passport.

In Ghana, permanent residents are issued an Indefinite Residence permit which is in the form of a sticker attached into the resident's passport.

In Hong Kong, permanent residents are issued a Hong Kong Permanent Identity Card.

In Japan and South Korea, all resident foreigners are issued a residence card, and for permanent residents this status is indicated.

In Lithuania, permanent residents are issued a photo ID ''(Leidimas gyventi)'' following a common EU design.

In Macau, permanent residents are issued a Macao Permanent Resident Identity Card (''Bilhete de Identidade de Residente Permanente'').

In Malaysia, permanent residents are issued with a [[MyPR]] card similar to the [[MyKad]] issued to Malaysian citizens, the difference being the colour (red instead of blue) and additional information stating the cardholder's country of origin.

In Singapore, permanent residents are issued a blue identity card with their photograph, thumb print and other personal particulars similar to citizen's pink identity card

In Slovakia, permanent residents are issued a red photo ID.

In South Africa, permanent residents who have their passport endorsed, are issued a certificate and a standard national green identity book showing "NON S.A. CITIZEN".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lissa.com/permanent-residence-permit/|title=LISSA  Permanent Residence Permit - Legal Migration Services|work=LISSA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Switzerland, permanent residents are issued either a biometric ID card in accordance with Schengen regulations if they are non EU/EFTA national, or a paper permit in a yellow-coloured plastic wallet if they are an EU/EFTA national.

In Taiwan, permanent residents are issued a blue photo ID card (APRC). A separate open work permit can also be issued to permanent residents allowing them to accept employment in any non-governmental positions for which they are qualified.  
 
In the United Kingdom, the applicant is issued with a photo ID card known as a [[UK Borders Act 2007|Biometric Residence Permit]] which states that the permit is a Settlement permit for Indefinite Leave to Remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://contact-ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/settlement/ |title=UK Border Agency - Settling in the UK |accessdate=2014-03-07 |publisher=Home Office |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308033932/https://contact-ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/settlement/ |archivedate=2014-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.narrowboat-waiouru.co.uk/2013/11/no-need-to-hide.html |title=nb Waiouru: No need to hide |accessdate=2014-03-07 |publisher=Thomas Everard Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, permanent residents are non-citizens issued a photo ID card which is officially known as a [[lawful permanent residents (United States)|Permanent Resident Card]], also known as a "green card".&lt;ref name="Green Card"&gt;{{cite web |title=Green Card |url=https://www.uscis.gov/greencard |date=February 22, 2018 |accessdate=2018-10-17 |publisher=[[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services|U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LPR"&gt;{{uscsub|8|1101|a|20}} ("The term '[[lawful permanent residents (United States)|lawfully admitted for permanent residence]]' means the status of having been lawfully [[wikt:accord#English|accorded]] the [[wikt:privilege#English|privilege]] of residing [[wikt:permanently#English|permanently]] in the United States as an [[wikt:immigrant#English|immigrant]] ...."); see also {{cite web |title=Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR) |url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/lawful-permanent-residents |date=October 2, 2018 |accessdate=2018-10-17 |publisher=[[United States Department of Homeland Security|U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security]] (DHS)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10975">'''R5''', in the [[film]] business, is a DVD of a movie sold in [[Russia]] much closer after the first screening in cinema, at reduced wholesale prices.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ANTiX" /&gt; It is made with a [[telecine]] machine from an analog source and is typically of a lower quality than other&lt;!--any region--&gt; retail releases.&lt;ref name="paramount" /&gt;&lt;!--"studio-produced unmastered telecine"--&gt;

In [[telecine]] (TK)&lt;!-- not a 'TC', but the process of transferring a motion picture film into video--&gt; is the digitization performed by the studio itself with very professional (and expensive) equipment and usually from the original source.&lt;ref name="district9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="norman" /&gt; The purpose of it is to create a high quality digital copy (usually for a later [[DVD]] release). But unlike a DVD, an R5 is released before the digital post-processing is finished.&lt;ref name="pukka" /&gt; The quality of the rips can widely differ, but an R5 can be almost indistinguishable from a DVDRip since many unauthorized film copies are published onto DVD with minimal editing.

This digital post-processing is an important step, and provides many qualitative benefits to the finished conversion and should not be under-appreciated.  From color correction to grain removal/reduction there are many steps that improve the transfer that generally the R5 does not have, even if done by the originating studio.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;!-- "Minor changes and adds from a Hollywood insider" http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=R5_(bootleg)&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=399340792 --&gt;

The name R5 refers to [[DVD region code|DVD Region]] 5.&lt;ref name="scenelingo" /&gt; In an effort to compete with [[copyright infringement]] in these areas, the [[movie industry]] chose to create a new format for DVD releases that could be produced more quickly and less expensively than traditional DVD releases.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tvcenter.ru" /&gt; R5 releases differ from normal releases in that they often lack both the image post-processing and special features that are common on DVD releases.&lt;ref name="rlslogmoviesrc" /&gt; This allows the film to be released for sale at the same time that DVD [[Screener (promotional)|screener]]s are released. Since these screeners are the chief source of high-quality pre-DVD release unauthorized film copies (in comparison to [[Cam (bootleg)|cam]] or [[telesync]], mostly), this allows the movie studios to beat the infringers to market.&lt;ref name="paramount" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dvdtalk" /&gt; [[Bootleg recording|Bootlegged]] copies of these releases are often distributed on the internet and in some cases, R5 DVDs may be released without an English audio track, requiring the encoder to use the direct line audio from the film's theatrical release. In this case, the unauthorized release will be tagged with "LiNE" to distinguish it from a release with a DVD audio track.&lt;ref name="district9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scenelingo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="releasedates" /&gt;
Before PUKKA/DREAMLiGHT introduced the R5 tag to the [[warez scene]]&lt;!-- as in they were the first scene group tagging with R5 --&gt;, the R5 releases were tagged as [[Telecine_(piracy)|TC]], [[Screener (promotional)|DVDSCR]] or [[DVD-Rip|DVDRip]].&lt;ref name="pukka" /&gt;

The image quality of an R5 release is generally comparable to a DVD Screener release, except without the added scrolling text and black and white scenes that serve to distinguish screeners from commercial DVD releases. R5 quality can be somewhat better than transfers produced by movie bootleggers because the transfer is performed using professional-grade film scanning equipment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;!--&lt;ref name="paramount" /&gt; "studio-produced unmastered telecine"--&gt;

{{unreferenced|date=May 2008}}The {{nihongo|'''Railway Construction Act'''|鉄道敷設法|Tetsudō Fusetsu-hō''|Law No. 4 of 1892|lead=yes}} was promulgated by the [[Diet of Japan]] on June 21, 1892, and designated government support for a network of thirty-three [[railway]] lines covering most of Japan, with the exception of [[Hokkaidō]]. On April 11, 1922, the Diet amended the law to add an additional network of regional and local routes. Today, these lines form the backbone of the national railway network, [[Japan Railways Group|JR]] (although JR has relinquished control of some of the more minor ones).

The [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|Victorian Government]]'s '''Act No. 821''', '''Railway Construction Act 1884''', authorised the construction of 59&lt;ref&gt;Some sources give this figure as 66.&lt;/ref&gt; new railway lines. Created by the Minister for Railways, [[Thomas Bent]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM01222b.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and passed on 12 December 1884, it became notorious for the excessive number of inner-city railways it created, and received the nickname "the '''Octopus Act'''". The depression of the 1890s soon rendered many of these lines unviable.

==Implementation==
The task of implementing the act fell to [[Richard Speight]], Railway Commissioner at the time,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A060189b.htm&lt;/ref&gt; a role created by the [[Victorian Railways Commissioners Act]] of 1883.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brightoncemetery.com/HistoricInterments/150Names/kibblew.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Beneficiaries of the act included construction engineers such as [[Andrew O'Keefe (engineer)|Andrew O'Keefe]], and politicians such as Thomas Bent himself, who reaped the rewards of commissioning construction in their own electorates.

Construction of the lines was complete by April 1890.&lt;ref&gt;http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3516141&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1892, outrage at the excesses of this construction boom, including a number of "white elephants", led to the sacking of Speight, [[Richard Ford (railway commissioner)|Richard Ford]]  and [[A J Agg]], the other commissioners. Then, the [[Railways Act of 1892]], attempted to reverse some of the damage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2238">In canon law, '''Right of Option''' is a way of obtaining a [[benefice]] or a [[title]], by the choice of the new titulary himself.

== History ==

Many chapters enjoyed this right formerly and it is still the privilege of some: the [[Canon (priest)|canon]], who has held his office for the longest time may, in conformity with the statutory regulation, resign the [[prebend]] he enjoys to accept another that has become vacant.

A second right of option existed in [[France]] before 1789: by virtue of a custom a prebendary, who was appointed to and had entered into possession of a benefice incompatible with one he already held, was entitled to select whichever of the two he preferred, when, according to the [[common law]], he had already lost the incompatible benefice which he had previously held. The right of option still exists with regard to [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]itial titles.

== Derivations in public law ==
In this way the canon law first established an ‘’incompatibility’’, giving life to the prohibition of the simultaneous possession of two ecclesiastical benefices. Since this sanction forward, also public law enshrined the same solution&lt;ref&gt;Italian Parliament, Chamber of deputies, IV legislature, Assembly, Official records, 31 jan. 1968, p. 43308.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to prevent the conflict of interests (for example between electoral mandates or different public offices) in a way less drastic than an [[Ineligibility Clause|ineligibility]]&lt;ref&gt;Temistocle Martines said the disqualification to be the effect, while the incompatibility is a cause, which has different effects depending on the choice of the legislature: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Incompatibilità delle cariche politiche tra Stato, Regioni e diritto comparato

{{Judicial interpretation}}
'''The rule of lenity''' (also called '''the rule of strict construction''') is a principle of [[Criminal law|criminal]] [[statutory interpretation]] that requires a court to apply any unclear or ambiguous law in the manner most favorable to the defendant. It has a long history in the law and has been an important element of the relationship between the courts and legislature, although its role in modern jurisprudence is less clear.

==Overview==
{{see|Separation of powers}}
Today, determining legislative intent is a critical job that arises from the distinct and separate roles played by the [[judiciary]] and the [[legislature]] in administering justice. [[Court|Judges]] are routinely required to apply the relevant laws and rules passed by the legislature to the decisions they make. There are reasons this can be difficult.

For one, laws are intended to apply generally and it would be impossible for the legislature to foresee all the possible situations to which they might apply after their enactment. Second, the manner in which laws are passed, which includes the influence of [[lobbying]] and interest groups, can sometimes obscure their purpose when finally enacted. Finally, the two branches are not allowed to "confer" with one another. Neither is the legislature allowed to add to a law it has already passed in order to affect a court's ruling, nor are the courts allowed to "inquire" as to how a law should be applied in the cases before them.

The two institutions have evolved tools to make the job easier. For instance, statutes often contain "definition" sections, which attempt to make plain how the statute should be read. The courts have developed "canons of construction", rules which are intended to guide the manner in which a statute is to be applied.

The rule of lenity is one such canon. Implicit in its provisions is the additional [[Burden of proof (law)|burden]] placed on the prosecution in a criminal case and the protection of [[Due process|individual rights]] against the powers of the state. It also furthers the fundamental principle of requiring [[notice]] in criminal law. Individuals should not be punished for their acts when the law fails to communicate to the public that such acts are forbidden.

It is intended only to apply to those instances where the court recognizes the existence of more than one interpretation ''and'' where the decision that the court reaches harms or benefits the defendant to some greater or lesser degree. In that case, the rule requires the court to select the interpretation most beneficial (or least detrimental) to the defendant.

==History==
The traditional rule, also called the rule of strict construction, arose for a very different purpose in the [[English common law]] than those cited in [[Laws of the United States|U.S. law]].

===English common law===
Originally, the rule was conceived by English judges trying to limit [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]'s use of the [[Death penalty in the United Kingdom|death penalty]]. When the facts of a case were not expressly described by a law, the court would "strictly construe" it so as to exclude its application to the case in question.

A 1547, a law passed that denied [[Benefit of clergy|a lesser sentence]] to first-time offenders convicted of "felonious stealing of Horses, Geldings or Mares" among other offenses.&lt;ref&gt; 1 Edw. VIII c.12(X)(3), (1547), {{cite book |last1=Ruffhead |first1=Owen |last2=Adams |first2=John |author-link1=Owen Ruffhead |author-link2=John Adams |date=1763 |title=The statutes at large: from Magna Charta, to the end of the last parliament, 1761.

The following year, Parliament explicitly addressed the rule's use with the passage of a new law, solely dedicated to horse thievery. They pointed to the prior law's "ambiguous" wording and its construction by the courts. The new law explicitly stated that those convicted of stealing "any Horse, Gelding, or Mare" shall be treated the same as those charged with "stealing two Horses, two Geldings, or two Mares, or any other".&lt;ref&gt; 2 &amp; 3 Edw. VIII c.37(X)(3), (1547), {{cite book |last1=Ruffhead |first1=Owen |last2=Adams |first2=John  |date=1763 |title=The statutes at large: from Magna Charta, to the end of the last parliament, 1761.

Under the reign of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], another law concerning first-offenders and livestock was similarly limited by the courts. This time, the act ambiguously referred to "Sheep, or other Cattle."&lt;ref&gt; 14 Geo. II c.6(I), (1547), {{cite book |last1=Ruffhead |first1=Owen |last2=Adams |first2=John  |date=1765 |title=The statutes at large: from Magna Charta, to the end of the last parliament, 1761.

In it, they expressly spell out that it shall apply to "any Bull, Cow, Ox, Steer, Bullock, Heifer, Calf and Lamb, as well as sheep".

===Early American law===
Laying out the rule's application in the American courts, it was first cited in 1820 by [[Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]] in ''[[United States v. Wiltberger]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The rule that penal laws are to be construed strictly, is perhaps not much less old than construction itself. It is founded on the tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals; and on the plain principle, that the power of punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial department.
...
[T]hough penal laws are to be construed strictly, they are not to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intention of the legislature. The maxim is not to be so applied as to narrow the words of the statute... in their ordinary acceptation, or in which the legislature has obviously used them.... The intention of the legislature is to be collected from the words they employ. Where there is no ambiguity in *the words, there is no room for construction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15837139254241140507&amp;q=united+states+v.+wiltberger&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39&amp;as_vis=1 18 US 76, 95 (Supreme Court 1820)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===20th century===
After its initial wide acceptance, other canons, such as the [[clear statement rule]] and the [[vagueness doctrine]], have encroached on the rule and its use by the courts. In 1961, [[Felix Frankfurter|Justice Frankfurter]] wrote in ''[[Callanan v. United States]]'', that the rule is for expressing the will of Congress, not protecting defendants from it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The rule of lenity [is] for resolving an ambiguity, not [creating one].... The rule comes into operation at the end of the process of interpreting what Congress has expressed, not at the beginning as an overriding consideration of being lenient to wrongdoers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10261023883092961366&amp;q=callanan+v+united+states&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39 364 U.S. 587, 596 (Supreme Court 1961)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Islamic law==
[[Sharia|Islamic law]] has a similar tenet which allows the imposition of [[Hudud|punishments]] only in the absence of "doubt or ambiguity".{{sfnp|Rabb|2011|page=1316-1317}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Intisar A.|last=Rabb |author-link=Intisar Rabb |title=Islamic Legal Maxims as Substantive Canons of Construction: Ḥudūd-Avoidance in Cases of Doubt |journal=Islamic Law and Society |volume= 17 |pages= 63–125 at 66 |date=2010 |url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1484&amp;context=lsfp |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern status==
The rule is today seen as an expression of [[legislative supremacy]].{{sfnp|Rabb|2011|page=1305}} It is infrequently cited in contemporary{{clarify|contemporary with what?|date=September 2018}} opinions.{{sfn|Price|2004|page=902}}

During oral arguments for the 2016 case, ''[[Lockhart v. United States (2016)|Lockhart v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?scidkt=18180785990255627732&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;hl=en 136 S. Ct. 958  (Supreme Court 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] ''[[sua sponte]]'' raised the question of the rule's application:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"... what I worry about is the rule of lenity. You have these dueling canons, and you have a rule that when the government sends somebody to jail for 10 years, it has to cross sharp corners. It has to dot every i and cross every t. It has to be clear!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Scalia Sticks Up for a Child Pornography Convict |last=Stern |first=Mark Joseph |work=[[Slate.com|Slate]] |date=3 November 2015 |access-date=3 October 2017|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/supreme_court_dispatches/2015/11/supreme_court_lockhart_case_scalia_argues_for_lenity.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the end, he joined the majority in refusing to apply the rule.&lt;ref&gt; 136 S. Ct. 958 at 968 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See the dissent by Justices [[Elena Kagan]] and [[Stephen Breyer]]. They expressly support the rule and its use in the case before them (136 S. Ct. at 977).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''State v. Thonesavanh'', The [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] expressly rejected the position that the rule "...allows a defendant to prevail in every instance in which a criminal statute is ambiguous."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18215598182342264352&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39 State v. Thonesavanh No.A15-2017, pt. III, para. 1 (decided Sep. 6, 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt; At issue was the question of whether the word "take" as used in the state's law against auto theft&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.52  Minn. Stat. 609.52, subd. 2(a)(17)]&lt;/ref&gt; required the accused to actually move the vehicle, or, as in the case before them, merely to enter it and lock the doors. The court relied on the doctrine of ''in pari materia'' in holding that the mere "temporary control" of the car was enough under the statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jones |first=Barbara L. |title=Supreme Court reverses ruling in auto theft that went nowhere |url=http://minnlawyer.com/2017/09/08/supreme-court-reverses-ruling-in-auto-theft-that-went-nowhere/ |date=8 September 2017 |work=Minnesota Lawyer |access-date=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] cited the rule in ''Commonwealth vs. Dayton'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?scidkt=10722638148962002824&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;hl=en No. SJC-12213, Discussion para. 2 (decided June 1, 2017)]&lt;/ref&gt; in ruling that the ambiguous language in the state's [[D.U.I.|OUI law]] did not permit a suspect to be held without bail unless they have been convicted three times under the statute, as opposed to merely being ''arrested'' three times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dunn |first=Bob |title=Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court finds OUI law ambiguous |url=http://www.berkshireeagle.com/stories/court-finds-oui-law-ambiguous,510169 |date=11 June 2017 |work=The Berkshire Eagle |access-date=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State codification===
The states of Florida and Ohio have [[Codification (law)|codified]] the rule.{{sfn|Price|2004|page=902}} The [[Florida Statutes|Florida statute]] states that the code "shall be strictly construed; when the language is susceptible of differing constructions, it shall be construed most favorably to the accused."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=  Florida Stat. Ann. |title = Sec. 775.021  |url=http://leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0700-0799/0775/Sections/0775.021.html|access-date=3 October 2017 |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Price|2004|page=902}} The [[Ohio Revised Code|Ohio law]] states simply that offenses and penalties shall be "strictly construed against the state and liberally construed in favor of the accused."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work= Ohio Rev. Code |title= Sec. 2901.04  |url=http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2901.04v1 |access-date=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A greater number of states, however, have statutorily eliminated the rule.{{sfn|Price|2004|page=903}}

'''Thai nationality law''' includes principles of both ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' and ''[[jus soli]]''. [[Thailand]]'s first Nationality Act was passed in 1913. The most recent law dates to 2008.

==''Jus sanguinis''==
{{Expand section|date=January 2013}}

Persons born anywhere in the world to at least one parent with Thai citizenship themselves are entitled to Thai citizenship at birth.
&lt;ref name="Embassy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canberra.thaiembassy.org/doc/info/info_migration.pdf|title=To Acquire a Thai Nationality|publisher=Royal Thai Embassy|place=Canberra, Australia|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Jus soli''==
[[File:Fongchan Suksaneh.jpg|thumb|right|Fongchan Suksaneh was one of the first people to gain ''jus soli'' citizenship under the 2008 Nationality Act]]

The first Thai Nationality Act of 1913 and most subsequent acts have included the principle of ''[[jus soli]]'', though at times with various restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Loos|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=C5ZcrsWCCtEC&amp;pg=PA134 134]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1952 Nationality Act rescinded the 1913 act's provisions for ''jus soli'', in response to concerns over the integration of the children of [[Thai Chinese|Chinese immigrants]], but unlimited ''jus soli'' was restored just four years later by the 1956 Nationality Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suryadinata|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qv-4ScjTO-AC&amp;pg=PA251 251]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, due to illegal immigration from Burma and concerns over communist insurgency in border areas, the Nationality Act was amended to require that both parents be legally resident and domiciled in Thailand for at least five years in order for their child to be granted Thai citizenship at birth, and revoked citizenship from many people who had it under the earlier act.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yang|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osg.gov.ph/index.php/component/content/article/36-country/365-thailand|title=Thailand|publisher=Office of the Solicitor General|publication-place=Republic of the Philippines|accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused difficulties for members of hill tribes in border areas who were not registered in the 1956 census, since they had no way to prove that their parents were Thai as opposed to having entered the country as refugees.&lt;ref name="BangkokPost20120610"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/print/297403/ |title=Reaching out to the people languishing in nowhere land |work=Bangkok Post |date=2012-06-10 |accessdate=2012-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jurist.org/dateline/2009/01/thailand-indigenous-population-faces.php|first=Necia|last=Hobbes|title=Thailand: Legal Obstacles to Citizenship for Indigenous Groups|work=Jurist Legal News and Research International Edition|date=2009-01-31|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 23 of the 2008 Nationality Act reversed the 1972 act, restoring citizenship to those who had it before, and allowing people born in Thailand before 1992 to apply for Thai citizenship anew. However, applicants have reported various difficulties in getting government officials to process their applications. Following the act's passage, one of the first people to gain citizenship under Article 23 was Fongchan Suksaneh, a child of American missionaries to the [[Mlabri people]] who was born in [[Chiang Mai Province]].&lt;ref name="BangkokPost20120610"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Napaumporn|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children, neither of whose parents are citizens and at least one of whose parents is an illegal alien, remain not entitled to ''[[jus soli]]'' citizenship.&lt;ref name="Embassy"/&gt; Furthermore, someone who has Thai citizenship by sole virtue of ''jus soli'' may still lose Thai citizenship under various conditions of the 2008 act (such as living abroad) which do not apply to people who have Thai citizenship by virtue of ''jus sanguinis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thailawforum.com/database1/Amendments-to-the-nationality-act.html|title=Amendments to the Nationality Act 2008|journal=Government Gazette of Thailand|volume=125|date=2008-02-27|accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the [[Ministry of Interior (Thailand)|Ministry of Interior]] proposed new immigration regulations, based on Section 7 of the 2008 Nationality Act, to declare children who did not gain Thai citizenship at birth as illegal immigrants and have them deported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/331366/ministry-cops-flak-over-push-to-deport-kids|title=Ministry cops flak over push to deport kids| work=Bangkok Post|date=2013-01-18|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naturalisation==
The strictness of Thailand's requirements for naturalisation have varied over the years, beginning with fairly loose restrictions, which were tightened in the mid-20th century before being loosened again.&lt;ref name="Suryadinata252"&gt;{{harvnb|Suryadinata|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qv-4ScjTO-AC&amp;pg=PA252 252]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nationality Act of 1939 tightened the requirements, stipulating that applicants for naturalisation had to abandon their foreign names and take [[Thai name]]s, as well as send their children to Thai schools; these rules were part of a broader trend of laws designed to promote the assimilation of the Thai Chinese community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chansiri|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xEMsg-FkbJIC&amp;pg=PA71 71]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1935 to 1958, a total of 4,652 Chinese naturalised as Thai citizens. More than half of the naturalisations occurred in 1943 alone, during the [[Japanese occupation of Thailand]], apparently driven by the desire to escape wartime restrictions on foreigners.&lt;ref name="Suryadinata252"/&gt;

Under the 1992 Nationality Act, naturalisation as a Thai citizen requires five years of residence in Thailand, as well as proof of a certain minimum income and [[renunciation of citizenship|renunciation]] of one's previous citizenship. The period of residence is reduced to three years for foreign women married to Thai men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://thethaiger.com/issues-answers/asked/thai-nationality-for-foreign-women|first=Suraphan|last=Suphachaiwat|title=Thai nationality for foreign women|work=Phuket Gazette|date=2003-10-30|accessdate=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{fv|date=January 2018&lt;!-- and see sections 10-12 of http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/506c08862.pdf --&gt;}} In 2003, 48 people applied for naturalisation, of whom ten were approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://thethaiger.com/issues-answers/asked/thai-citizenship-procedure|first=Somdej|last=Khanthawong|title=Thai citizenship procedure|work=Phuket Gazette|date=2004-10-28|accessdate=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Section 99 of the [[2007 Constitution of Thailand]], a naturalised citizen does not gain the  right to vote until five years after naturalisation; under Sections 101, 115, 174, and 205, naturalised citizens have no right at all to stand for election to the House of Representatives or the [[Senate (Thailand)|Senate]], or to be appointed as a minister or a justice of the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianlii.org/th/legis/const/2007/1.html|title=Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand (Unofficial Translation)|publisher=Asian Legal Information Institute|year=2007|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statelessness==
{{Asof|2016}} there were 443,862 stateless people in Thailand who were born in Thailand and live there. Mostly they are from hill tribes or are the children of illegal migrants, most of them from Myanmar. Stateless people in Thailand suffer serious disadvantages. Unlike Thai citizens, they cannot use government facilities where they must first show an ID card. They cannot go to a clinic or hospital for treatment of illness or injury. They cannot open a bank account. They cannot buy and use a smartphone, or own and drive a car, or buy property or a home. Some progress is being made, but "...these efforts are halfhearted and plagued with bureaucratic hurdles" according to the ''[[Bangkok Post]]''. It gives as an example a new law, passed in 2008, that grants Thai citizenship to stateless people. But it applies only to those who were born before 26 February 1992, thus impacting the young most harshly. The good news is that stateless children can now attend state schools. Also, a new law allows stateless people to seek employment in professions not explicitly reserved for Thais. State hospitals now issue birth certificates to all children, a formality often neglected in the past. Importantly, the Thai military government has adopted the goal of "zero statelessness" by 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Plight of the stateless|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1153413/plight-of-the-stateless|accessdate=7 December 2016|work=Bangkok Post|date=7 December 2016|format=Editorial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tort law in India''' is a relatively new [[common law]] development supplemented by codifying statutes including statutes governing [[damages]]. While India generally follows the UK approach, there are certain differences which may indicate [[judicial activism]], hence creating controversy. [[Tort]] is breach of some duty independent of [[contract]] which has caused damage to the plaintiff giving rise to civil [[cause of action]] and for which [[Legal remedy|remedy]] is available. If there is no remedy it cannot be called a tort because the essence of tort is to give remedy to the person who has suffered injury.

==Sources of law==

Tort law in India, like her common law counterparts, stems from both statute and common law.

===Statutes===

Similar to other common law countries,&lt;ref&gt;See Defamation Act 1952 of UK and Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) of Australia&lt;/ref&gt; aspects of tort law have been codified.&lt;ref&gt;See Motor Vehicle Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the [[Indian Penal Code]] criminalises certain areas of tort law.&lt;ref&gt;Defamation and certain areas of negligence are criminalised in the [[Indian Penal Code]], Act No. 45 of 1860&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common law===

As tort law is a relatively young area of law in India, apart from referring to local judicial precedents, courts have readily referred to [[case law]] from other common law jurisdictions, such as UK,&lt;ref&gt;See ''J. Kuppanna Chetty, Ambati Ramayya Chetty and Co. v Collector of Anantapur and Ors'' 1965 (2) ALT 261 at [39].&lt;/ref&gt; Australia,&lt;ref&gt;See ''Rattan Lal Mehta v Rajinder Kapoor'' [1996] ACJ 372 at [10].&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Rattan v Rajinder'' (1996) ACJ 372 at [8], [11], and [13].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relevant local customs and practices===

However, attention is given to local [[Cultural practice|socio-cultural practices]] and conditions in applying foreign legal principles. The legislature have also created statutes to provide for certain social conditions; for example, due to the nature of Indian families, a statute was passed to simplify determination of damages in the event of family members.{{Clarify|date=January 2014|reason=This sentence is not complete.}}&lt;ref name="motor"&gt;Motor Vehicles Act 1988, Act No. 59 of 1988, Second Schedule, inserted by Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 1994 of UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories of torts==
===Offences to the person===
====Assault====

Indian courts have held that to constitute [[assault]] it is not necessary that there should be some actual hurt caused. A [[threat]] constitutes assault.&lt;ref&gt;''Rupabati v. Shyama'' [1958] Cut 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ingredients are set out below:&lt;ref name="penal"&gt;The Indian Penal Code Act No. 45 of 1860 s 350.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Making of any gesture or preparation by a person in the presence of another.
*Intention or knowledge of likelihood that such gesture or preparation will cause the person present to apprehend that the person making it is about to use criminal force on him.

====Battery====

The criteria for [[Battery (crime)|battery]] is equivalent to that of criminal force&lt;ref&gt;The Law of Tort, P. S. Atchuthen Pillai (Eastern Book Co, 8 Ed, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; defined in Section 350 of the Indian Penal Code.&lt;ref&gt;S350 of the Indian Penal Code: "Whoever intentionally uses force to any person, without that person's consent in order to the committing of any offence or intending by the use of such force he will cause injury, fear, or annoyance to the person to whom the force is used is said to use criminal force to that other".&lt;/ref&gt;

====False imprisonment====

[[False imprisonment]] "is the complete deprivation of his liberty for any time, however short, without lawful cause&amp;nbsp;... There need not be any actual imprisonment in the ordinary sense."&lt;ref&gt;The Law of Tort, P. S. Atchuthen Pillai (Eastern Book Co, 8 Ed, 1987) at p 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ingredients of this tort are listed below:&lt;ref&gt;'The Law of Tort, P. S. Atchuthen Pillai (Eastern Book Co, 8 Ed, 1987) at pp 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Restraint must be complete.
*There must be no reasonable condition imposed by occupiers of premises.
*There must be no reasonable and honest belief which would justify the confinement.

===Negligence===

In regard to [[negligence]], Indian jurisprudence have approved the approach stated in ''Ratanlal &amp; Dhirajlal: The Law of Torts'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|editor-last=Singh J|editor-first=G.P.|title=The Law of Torts|author=Ratanlal &amp; Dhirajlal|publisher=Butterworths|edition=24th.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the case of Ms Grewal &amp; Anor v Deep Chand Soon &amp; Ors [2001] L.R.I. 1289 at [14], the court held that "negligence in common parlance mean and imply failure to exercise due care, expected of a reasonable prudent person. It is a breach of duty and negligence in law ranging from inadvertence to shameful disregard of safety of others. ... negligence represents a state of the mind which however is much serious in nature than mere inadvertence. ... whereas inadvertence is a milder form of negligence, negligence by itself means and imply a state of mind where there is no regard for duty or the supposed care and attention which one ought to bestow."&lt;/ref&gt; laying down three elements:

*A legal duty to exercise "ordinary care and skill".
*The breach of [the] duty caused by the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided by those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs would do, or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do.
*Resulting in injury to the plaintiff's person or property.

====Professional negligence====

The Indian approach to [[Professional negligence in English law|professional negligence]] requires that any skilled task requires a skilled professional.&lt;ref&gt;''Jacob Mathew v State of Punjab'' [2005] S.C. 0547, per R.C. Lahoti.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a professional would be expected to be exercising his skill with reasonable competence.&lt;ref name="JM"&gt;''Jacob Mathew v State of Punjab'' at [8]&lt;/ref&gt;

Professionals may be held liable for negligence on one of two findings:

*He was not possessed of the requisite skill which he professed to have possessed.
*He did not exercise, with reasonable competence in the given case, the skill which he did possess.

The standard to be applied for judging negligence would be that of an ordinary competent person exercising ordinary skill in that profession. It is not necessary for every professional to possess the highest level of expertise in that branch which he practices.&lt;ref name="JM"/&gt; Professional opinion is generally accepted, but courts may rule otherwise if they feel that the opinion is "not reasonable or responsible".&lt;ref&gt;''Vinitha Ashok v Lakshmi Hospital &amp; Ors'' [2001] 4 L.R.I.292 at [39].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contributory negligence====

Indian Courts recognise the concept of [[contributory negligence]]. Contributory negligence means the failure by a person to use reasonable care for the safety of either of himself or his property, so that he becomes blameworthy in part as an "author of his own wrong".&lt;ref&gt;''Pramodkumar Rasikbhai Jhaveri v Karmasey Tak and Ors''. [2002] S.C. 5436, as per Balakrishnan J.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of reasonable care on the part of the claimant, courts are likely to reduce the liability of the injurer. "The rule of negligence with the defense of contributory negligence holds an injurer liable if and only if he was negligent and the victim was not. In India, this rule requires proportional sharing of liability when both parties were negligent. That is, the compensation that the victim receives gets reduced in proportion to his or her negligence."&lt;ref&gt;Relationship between Liability Regimes and Economic Development: A Study of Motor Vehible Accidents in India, Ram Singh, CSLG Working Paper Series, CSLG/WP/09/03&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defamation===

The tort of [[defamation]] in India has largely followed the approach taken by the UK. Indian courts have endorsed the defences of absolute&lt;ref&gt;''Pukhraj v State of Rajasthan'' [1973] SCC (Cri) 944.&lt;/ref&gt; and qualified privilege,&lt;ref&gt;''Rustom K. Karanjia and Anr v Krishnaraj M.D. Thackersey and Ors.'' (1970) 72 BOMLR 94.&lt;/ref&gt; fair comment&lt;ref&gt;‘’Ram Jethmalani Vs. Subramaniam Swamy'’ 2006 (87) DRJ 603.&lt;/ref&gt; and justification.&lt;ref&gt;''Santosh Tewari and Ors V State of U.P. and Anr'' 1996 (20) ACR 808.&lt;/ref&gt; In UK, if the defendant is only successful in proving the truth of some of the several charges against him, the defence of justification might still be available if the charges not proved do not materially injure the reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Defamation Act, 1952 (England).&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no such provision in India, the law is possibly the same.&lt;ref name="analysis"&gt;{{citation|author=Ayesha|title=The Tort of Defamation: An Analysis of the Law in India and the United Kingdom|date=6 October 2010|url=http://jurisonline.in/2010/10/the-tort-of-defamation-an-analysis-of-the-law-in-india-and-the-united-kingdom/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001185414/http://jurisonline.in/2010/10/the-tort-of-defamation-an-analysis-of-the-law-in-india-and-the-united-kingdom/|archivedate=1 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, incidents of defamation in relation to public figures are highlighted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mylaw.net/Article/Defamation_law_in_India/?past=Article%20List#.Uc1SYfkwdNM,Samarjit Pattnaik, Aju John 'Defamation Law in India'2 March 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in India, the weight of the authorities is for discarding between libel and slander and making both of them actionable ''[[Per se (terminology)|per se]]''.&lt;ref name="analysis"/&gt; In UK, only libel and certain types of slander is actionable ''per se''.&lt;ref&gt;''English and Scottish Co-operative Properties Mortgage and Investment Society Ltd v Odhams Press Ltd'' [1940] 1 All ER 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal libel in UK was abolished in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2009/ukpga_20090025_en_6 |title=Coroners and Justice Act 2009 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=17 August 2010|accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while both slander and libel remain criminal offences in India,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Indian Penal Code Chapter XXI|year=1860|url=http://www.helplinelaw.com/docs/THE%20INDIAN%20PENAL%20CODE,%201860/CHAPTER%20XXI%20OF%20DEFAMATION.}}&lt;/ref&gt; making people liable not just to the extent of damages but also undergoing imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author= Vibhor Verdhan|title=Online Defamation &amp; Various Legal Issues|date=4 September 2001|url= http://legalserviceindia.com/article/l380-Online-Defamation.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; An injunction may also be granted to stop further publication of defamatory material.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Prameela Ravindran v. P. Lakshmikutty Amma'' A.I.R. 2001 Mad 225 and ‘Douglas V Hello! Ltd’ (2005) 3 WLR 881.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic torts===

[[Economic Torts]] seek to protect a person in relation to his trade, business or livelihood.&lt;ref name="mark"&gt;{{citation|title=Markesinis and Deakin’s tort law 6th ed|author=Simon Deakin, Angus Johnston and Basil Markesinis|publisher=Clarendon press, Oxford|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Indian courts has been reluctant to award damages for the economic torts of simple and unlawful conspiracy as well as inducing breach of contract due to the confused state of the law,&lt;ref&gt;''Rohtas Industries Ltd. and Anr. V Rohtas Industries Staff Union and Ors'' [1976] 3 SCR 12.&lt;/ref&gt; the court has allowed damages for torts affecting economic interests under the conspiracy to injure, and in doing so, referred to UK authorities on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;''Rajlal Sindhi V Kaka &amp; Company, Satna and Anr'' ILR [1984] MP 645.&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts have however been more willing to adopt the law in UK in areas such as the tort of deceit,&lt;ref&gt;''Ellerman &amp; Bucknall Steamship Co. Ltd v Sha Misrimal Bherajee'' [1966] SuppSCR 92.&lt;/ref&gt; unlawful interference with trade,&lt;ref&gt;''Gujarat Bottling Co. Ltd. and others vs Coca Cola Company and others'' 1995 (2) ARBLR 249 (SC).&lt;/ref&gt; intimidation,&lt;ref&gt;''Bavisetti Venkata Surya Rao V Respondent: Nandipati Muthayya'' AIR1964AP382&lt;/ref&gt; and malicious falsehood.&lt;ref&gt;''Dabur India Ltd. V Colortek Meghalaya Pvt. Ltd.'' 2010 (42) PTC 88 (Del).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land torts===

Land torts seek to prevent interference with land in the possession of another.&lt;ref name="entick"&gt;''Entick v Carrington''(1765) 95 ER 807.&lt;/ref&gt; Interference may take the form of entering land or part of it, or of remaining there after the withdrawal of permission, or of dispossessing the occupant.&lt;ref name="mark"/&gt;

====Trespass to land====

[[Trespass to land]] is any direct interference with land in the possession of another and is actionable ''per se''.&lt;ref name="mark"/&gt; Examples of trespass are unauthorised entry to land, placing things on land and inducing animals to enter.&lt;ref&gt;''Tutton v A. D. Walter Ltd'' [1986] QB 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, continuing trespass, which is actionable from day to day,&lt;ref&gt;''Holmes v Wilson'' (1839) 10 A&amp;E 503.&lt;/ref&gt; occurs when there is continuation of presence after permission is withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;''Lonskier v B. Goodman Ltd'' [1928] 1 KB 421.&lt;/ref&gt; The position taken with regards to the elements of trespass is similar in the UK and India.&lt;ref&gt;''Kewal Chand Mimani(d) by Lrs. v S.K. Sen and Ors'' (2001) 3 SCR 1056.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nuisance====

[[Nuisance]] is a form of lesser interference with land.&lt;ref name="mark"/&gt; It may be private or public, and private nuisance has come to cover the conduct of the defendants which affects the claimant's interest in the land.&lt;ref&gt;''Goldman v Hargrave'' [1967] 1 AC 645.&lt;/ref&gt; This could be done by:

*Affecting materially his land.
*Affecting his use or enjoyment of it.
*Interfering with servitudes and similar rights over the land.&lt;ref name="mark"/&gt;

While private nuisance is always actionable, [[public nuisance]] is not. A claimant of public nuisance has to establish special loss over and above the inconvenience suffered by the public in general,&lt;ref&gt;''Ricket v Metropolitan Ry. Co'' (1867) LR 2 HL 175.&lt;/ref&gt; as public nuisance is a crime and it would be unreasonable for everyone inconvenienced by it to be allowed to claim.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Rimmington and Goldstein'' [2006] 1 AC 459.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction was followed in India,&lt;ref&gt;''Datta Mal Chiranji Lal V L. Ladli Prasad and Anr'' 1960 AII 632.&lt;/ref&gt; along with the UK principles of nuisance.&lt;ref&gt;''Roshan Lal and Anr.v Banwari Lal and Anr'' 1986 (2) WLN 733.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rule in ''Rylands v Fletcher''====

Anyone who in the course of "non-natural" use of his land "accumulates" thereon for his own purposes anything likely to do [[mischief]] if it escapes is answerable for all direct damage thereby caused.&lt;ref&gt;''Rylands v Fletcher'' (1868) LR 3 HL 330.&lt;/ref&gt; It imposes strict liability on certain areas of nuisance law.&lt;ref name="mark"/&gt;

While in the UK, this rule is strictly "a remedy for damage to land or interests in land" and "damages for personal injuries are not recoverable under the rule",&lt;ref&gt;''Transco plc v Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council'' [2003] UKHL 61.&lt;/ref&gt; in India, the courts have developed this rule into a separate area of absolute liability rule, where an enterprise is absolutely liable, without exceptions, to compensate everyone affected by any accident resulting from the operation of hazardous activity.&lt;ref name="mehta"&gt;''MC Mehta v Union of India'' AIR 1987 SC 1086 (Oleum Gas Leak Case).&lt;/ref&gt; This differs greatly from the UK approach as it includes all kinds of resulting liability other than damage to land.&lt;ref name="mehta"/&gt;

===Constitutional torts===

Another area of tort that developed in India which differs from the UK is the availability of constitutional torts. Creating constitutional torts is a public law remedy for violations of rights, generally by agents of the state, and is implicitly premised on the strict liability principle.&lt;ref&gt;The landmark case on this was ''Rudul Sah v State of Bihar'' (1983) 4 SCC 141 – a case on illegal detention.&lt;/ref&gt; The tort was further entrenched when the court allowed compensation to be awarded as "a remedy available in public law; based on strict liability for the contravention of fundamental rights to which the principle of sovereign immunity does not apply, even though it may be available as a defence in private law in an action based on tort".&lt;ref&gt;''Nilabati Behara v State of Orissa'' (1993) 2 SCC 746.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is vastly different from the approach taken in UK as compensation for damages is not an available public law remedy.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rookes v Barnard]]'' [1964] UKHL 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Damages==

===Calculation of damages===

[[File:Personalinjury.png|thumb|Heads of claims under personal injury]]
[[Damages]] in the law of torts in India are premised on the concept of ''[[restitutio ad integrum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Destruction of Public and Private Properties v State of A.P. and Ors'' (2009) 5 SCC 212.&lt;/ref&gt; India adopts a compensatory method and advocates "full and fair compensation" in all cases.&lt;ref&gt;''Rattan v Rajinder''(1996) ACJ 372 at [19].&lt;/ref&gt;

In determining the quantum of damages, the Indian court will look to similar cases that may enable comparison.&lt;ref&gt;The court acknowledged that "no two cases are alike, but still, it is possible to make a broad classification which enables one to bring comparable awards together" ''P Satyanarayana v I Babu Rajendra Prasad &amp; Anor'' 1998 ACJ 88 at [26].&lt;/ref&gt;

India’s formulation of damages for tort cases is premised on the multiplier method, awarding compensation based on the degree of compromise to the earning ability of the victim.&lt;ref&gt;''Bijoy Kumar Dugar v. Bidya Dhar Dutta'' (2006) 3 SCC 242; ''Spring Meadows Hospital v. Harjot Ahluwalia'' (1998) 4 SCC 39 and ''Klaus Mittelbachert v. East India Hotels'' AIR 1997 Del 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the multiplier method, the fair and just amount represents

{{quote|the number of years' purchase on which the loss of dependency is capitalised. Then allowance to scale down the multiplier would have to be made taking into account the uncertainties of the future. The allowance for immediate lump sum payment the period over which the dependency is to last being shorter and the capital feed also to be spent away over the period of dependency is to last.&lt;ref&gt;''general manager, Kerala State Road Transport Corporation, Trivandrum v. Susamma Thomas (Mrs.) and Ors'' at [17].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The multiplier principle is encapsulated in a statutory form for tortious cases involving personal injuries caused by motor vehicles, under the Motor Vehicle Act.&lt;ref&gt;Motor Vehicle Act c163A (India) Second Schedule.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in so calculating, the court will take into account inflation in calculating damages.&lt;ref&gt;''Nagappa v Gurudayal Singh &amp; Ors'' [2003] 1 LRI 76 at [26].&lt;/ref&gt;

For instances of pecuniary damages with regards to personal injury, the following heads{{Clarify|date=January 2014|reason=Heads, what does that mean?}} will be taken into account:&lt;ref&gt;''Lata Wadhwa &amp; Ors v State of Bihar &amp; Ors'' [2001] 3 LRI 1112.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Loss of earning.
*Medical, hospital and nursing expenses.
*The loss of matrimonial prospects.

In instances of non-pecuniary loss, the following will be taken into consideration:&lt;ref&gt;''Lata Wadhwa &amp; Ors''.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Loss of expectation of life.
*Loss of amenities or capacity for enjoying life.
*Loss or impairment of physiological function.
*Pain and suffering.

Aggravated damages may be awarded to compensate victims for their wounded feelings in tortious cases in certain cases.&lt;ref&gt;These cases are cases where the damages are at large and not limited to pecuniary loss&lt;/ref&gt; These damages are determined by examining if the defendant's conduct aggravated the plaintiff's damage by injuring "feelings of dignity, safety and pride".&lt;ref&gt;''Destruction of Public and Private Properties v State of A.P. and Ors.'' AIR 2009 SC 2266 at [5].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approach towards pain and suffering===

In analysing [[pain and suffering]], several factors such as severity of injury, medical treatment required, psychological stress&lt;ref&gt;''Lata Wadhwa &amp; Ors'' at [5]&lt;/ref&gt; and long-term physical and emotional scars, would be taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;''Nagappa v Gurudayal Singh &amp; Ors'' [2003] 1 LRI 76 at [25]&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of victims who were unconscious, one must award not only for the "loss of amenities and loss of expectation of life, but also for pain and suffering".&lt;ref&gt;''Rattan v Rajinder'' (1996) ACJ 372 at [19].&lt;/ref&gt; Such damages are awarded not as a matter of "solace".&lt;ref name="rat"&gt;''Rattan v Rajinder'' at [19].&lt;/ref&gt; This view comes close to that expressed by [[Lord Scarman]] in ''Lim Poh Choo v Camden and Islington Area Health Authority'',&lt;ref&gt;''Lim Poh Choo v Camden and Islington Area Health Authority'' [1979] UKHL 1.&lt;/ref&gt; difference being that an award must be "made even for pain and suffering in case of unconscious plaintiffs".&lt;ref name="rat"/&gt; The reason for so doing is that it "looks strange that wrongdoer whose negligence makes the victim unconscious is placed in a more advantageous position than one who inflicts a lesser injury which does not render the victim unconscious".&lt;ref&gt;''P Satyanarayana v I Babu Rajendra Prasad &amp; Anor'' (1988) ACJ 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three guiding principles in measuring the quantum of compensation for pain and suffering:&lt;ref&gt;''Klaus Mittelbachert v East India Hotels Ltd'' at [64].&lt;/ref&gt;

*Amount of compensation awarded must be reasonable and must be assessed with moderation.
*Regard must be had to awards made in comparable cases.
*The sum awarded must to a considerable extent be conventional.

===Punitive damages===

Being influenced by ''[[Rookes v Barnard]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Rookes v Barnard|link=Rookes v Barnard|court=UKHL|year=1964|num=1|parallelcite=[1964] AC 1129|date=21 January 1964}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the India Court ruled that [[punitive damages]] can be awarded in only three categories:&lt;ref&gt;''Rustom K. Karanjia and Anr. v Krishnaraj M.D. Thackersey and Ors'' (1970) 72 BOMLR 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Cases where the plaintiff is injured by the oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional action by a servant of the government.
*Cases in which the defendant’s conduct has been calculated by him to make a profit for himself which may well exceed the compensation payable to the plaintiff.
*Where provided by statute.

However, this stand has since shifted with an expanding tort jurisdiction. The [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] accepted a committee's suggestion to evolve a "principle of liability – punitive in nature – on account of vandalism and rioting".&lt;ref name="dppp"&gt;''Destruction of Public and Private Properties'' at [4].&lt;/ref&gt; The reasoning given was that it "would deter people from similar behaviour in the future".&lt;ref name="dppp"/&gt;

In an environmental tort case, the defendant was made to pay exemplary damages 	"so that it may act as deterrent for others not to cause pollution in any manner".&lt;ref&gt;''M. C. Mehta v. Kamal Nath'' (1997) 1 SCC 388 at [24].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tortious litigation==

Despite being often cited as a litigious country,&lt;ref&gt;Marc Galanter, "Part I Courts, Institutions, and Access to Justice: “To the Listed Field …”: The Myth of Litigious India” (2009) 1 Jindal Global Law Rev. 65 at 70&lt;/ref&gt; the rate of litigation is low,  due to problems such as long delays, heavy expenses and meagre damage awards.&lt;ref name="Galanter, at 74"&gt;Galanter, at 74.&lt;/ref&gt; There has apparently been an increase in litigation over the past years, especially with cases involving the government.&lt;ref name="chugh"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.legalserviceindia.com/article/l452-Litigation-&amp;-Delays-in-India.html|title=Litigation &amp; Delays in India|publisher=Legal Service India|author=Bharat Chugh|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been said to be due to India’s socio-economic growth and the resultant sensitisation regarding legal rights.&lt;ref name="chugh"/&gt;

===Difficulties in the legal system===

The delay in delivery of justice is a major problem plaguing India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_pendency-of-cases-are-gigantic-problems-sc-judge_1264662|title=Pendency of cases are "gigantic problems": SC Judge|publisher=Daily News &amp; Analysis|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been attributed to reasons such a low judge to population ratio (1 judge per 100,000 capita, with a small number of courts available),&lt;ref&gt;''Pendency of cases are "gigantic problems": SC Judge.'' see table 1.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as poor administrative governance.&lt;ref name="gal"&gt;Galanter, at 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outmoded procedural laws allow for delaying tactics, such as interlocutory appeals and stay orders.&lt;ref name="gal"/&gt; The government has also been accused of employing delay tactics whenever it is a litigant, appealing even when the chance of success is remote.&lt;ref&gt;Galanter, at 73-74.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the system appears to resemble a "sunk cost auction", where litigants invest ever-increasing amounts to stave off higher losses.&lt;ref name="Galanter, at 74"/&gt;

===Reforms===

Due to the problems noted above, it has been stated that reformation lay with the parliamentarians and legislators. [[Law reform|Structural reforms]] are to be brought about by amendments to legislation, while operational reforms can only be brought about by "a change in mindset".&lt;ref&gt;''Pendency of cases are "gigantic problems": SC Judge.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
[[File:Art21.png|thumb|Article 21 is at contention here with regards to constitutional torts.]]

===Absolute liability===

One of the controversies in Indian tort law concerns the rule on [[absolute liability]]. The extremely strict approach, where even [[Act of God|acts of God]] are not recognised as a defence is severely criticised especially since it disregarded the "generally accepted parameter of minimum competence and reasonable care".&lt;ref name="Ghosh"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.lawyersclubindia.com/articles/Strict-and-Absolute-Liability-A-critique-1451.asp|title=The Concept of Strict and Absolute Liability: A Critique|publisher=Lawyers Club India|author=Indranil Ghosh|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of such a rule endangers the growth of science and technical industries, as investors have to take the risk of liability given that there is no defence to the rule.&lt;ref name="Ghosh"/&gt;

===Judicial activism===

The judiciary has been criticised for being overly [[Judicial activism|activist]] and overstepping its jurisdiction. By creating constitutional torts, they are accused of usurping both legislative and administrative functions.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Cassels, "Judicial Activism and Public Interest Litigation in India: Attempting the Impossible" (1989) 37 Am. J. Comp. L. 495 at 509.&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy further arose when judges began to read such obligations of the state into Article 21 of the [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;''Noor Mahmmad Usmanbhai Mansuri v State of Gujarat'' (1997) 1 GujLH 49 at [57].&lt;/ref&gt; to impose [[vicarious liability]] on the state.&lt;ref&gt;Such situations include custodial violence (''Lawyers' Forum for Human Rights v State of West Bengal'' (1997) 1 CalHCN – a case where a man died in police custody; held that "it is the paramount duty of police officials to protect his body" at 491), medical negligence (''Rasikbhai Ramsing Rana v State of Gujarat'' (1998) 9 SCC 604 – here the prison officials neglected in providing medical treatment to a prisoner assaulted by other inmates, resulting in the victim’s death), encounter deaths (extra-judicial killings in staged encounters; see ''People’s Union for Civil Liberties v Union of India'' (1997) 3 SCC 433), illegal detention, disappearances (see ''Sebastian Hongray v Union of India'' (1984) 1 SCC 339), and culpable inaction.&lt;/ref&gt; However, such judicial activism in India has been used for "achieving social and distributive justice."&lt;ref&gt;P N Bhagwati, "The Role of the Judiciary in the Democratic and Judicial Restraint" (1992) 18 CommwLBull 1262 at 1266.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Registration of Trademarks ==

=== Meaning of Trademark ===
Per the Amendment,  a trademark means, sign or combination of signs including words such as personal names, letters, numerals, and figurative elements.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;The Amendment, s 1&lt;/ref&gt; A trademark may consist of words, personal names, designs, letters, colours, numerals, shapes, holograms, sounds or a combination of any of these elements; slogans, where they are not long enough to be protected by [[Copyright|copyrights]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Application for Registration ===
The application for registration of a trademark must be filed with the [http://rgd.gov.gh/index.php/services/intellectual-property/trademark-registration/ Registrar] and is contingent on the payment of a prescribed fee.&lt;ref&gt;The Amendment, s 4(1)&lt;/ref&gt; The application must contain a reproduction of the trademark and a list of goods or services for which for which the registration of the trademark is made and the applicant must have a ''bona fide'' intention for which the trademark is to be used in relation to goods or services.&lt;ref&gt;The Amendment, s 4(2)&lt;/ref&gt; The application may contain a declaration claiming the priority of an earlier national or regional application filed by the applicant or the predecessor in title of the applicant.&lt;ref&gt;The Act, s 4(3)&lt;/ref&gt;	

An application for registration can be refused on several grounds such as where the trademark is a trade name, it is incapable of distinguishing the goods or services of one enterprise from the goods or services of another enterprise or devoid of distinctive character,  it is contrary to public order or morality or it is likely to mislead the public or trade circles with particular reference to the geographical origin of the goods or services, their nature or characteristics among others.&lt;ref&gt;The Amendment, s 5&lt;/ref&gt; 

Once the Registrar has examined the application for registration of the trademark and is satisfied that it complies with all the Act, the Registrar shall then publish the application as to allow any interested person to file a notice of opposition claiming that one or more of the requirements have not been met.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;The Act, s 6 &lt;/ref&gt;  When the Registrar sends a copy of the notice of opposition to the applicant and the applicant does not respond to the claims of the notice, the applicant will be deemed to have abandoned the application.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Where the application has not been opposed within the prescribed time limit or any oppositions were granted in favour of the applicant and the Registrar is satisfied that the application has met all necessary requirement, the Registrar shall then register the trademark, publish a reference to the registration and issue the applicant with a certificate of registration.&lt;ref&gt;The Act, s 7&lt;/ref&gt; When the trademark has been published trademark enjoys the same rights and privileges as if the trademark has been registered so long as the application has been published.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Meaning of Collective Mark ===
The Amendment defines a collective mark is a visual sign capable of distinguishing the origin or any other characteristic of different enterprises which use the sign under the control of a registered owner from any other enterprises or a collective mark can be a visual sign cable of distinguishing the origin of the quality of goods or services of different enterprises which use the sign under the control of a registered owner from goods and services of any other enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;The Amendment, s 2&lt;/ref&gt; The former meaning can be described as a collective membership mark as the mark only serves to show membership in a collective group of enterprises and the collective itself does not use the mark to identify its products or services. The latter meaning of collective mark can be described as a collective mark for commerce as the mark is intended to identify the goods or service as belonging to a certain membership of enterprises.

=== Registration of Collective Mark ===
The registration procedure for collective marks is the same as the registration procedure for trademarks, and thus the Registrar may grant an applicant a registration certificate for a collective mark once he is satisfied that all requirements have been met. The only difference between the registration of trademarks and collective marks is that an application for registration of a collective mark shall designate the trademark as a collective mark and shall be accompanied with a copy of the regulations governing the use of the collective mark.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;The Act, s 8&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Rights Conferred by the Registration of Trademarks and Collective Marks ===
A person other than a registered owner of a trademark shall not knowingly infringe the rights of the owner of a registered trademark by using a trademark in relation to goods or services for which the trademark was registered without the consent of the owner.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;The Act, s 9&lt;/ref&gt;  A person may also not use signs that are similar and identical to the registered trademark as the registered owner's right extend to such identical signs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  In the Ghanaian case of ''Menkish Impex Limited v Pam Ventures Limited''&lt;ref&gt;Suit No.IPR/2/09&lt;/ref&gt;, it was held that, in relation to the two marks ‘’Heaven’’ and ‘’Dhoom’’, they are not so similar as to qualify for an infringement of trademark. The defendant’s mark ‘’Dhoom’’ was held not to resemble the Plaintiff’s registered mark as to cause the likelihood of confusion and deception.

Although the registered owner of a trademark has exclusive rights, such rights are limited to an extent. The rights conferred by registration do not extend, thus in turn no infringement claim can arise, to acts in respect of articles which have been put on the market in any country by the registered owner or with the consent of the owner.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

Once the registered owner establishes an infringement of trademark, either by the authorised use of the registered trademark or acts likely to infringe the trademark, the registered owner may institute court action against a person who infringes a registered trademark and such a person may be held to have committed an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of two hundred and fifty (250) penalty units or term of imprisonment not exceeding one year or both.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

=== Duration of Trademark and Collective Mark Protection ===
The duration of a registered trademark is for a period of ten(10) years from the filing date of the application for registration and may be renewed for a consecutive period of ten years subject to the payment of a prescribed fee for renewal.&lt;ref&gt;The Act, s 10&lt;/ref&gt; The registration of a collective mark enjoys the same duration and renewal rights as a trademark.&lt;ref&gt;The Act, s 8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Invalidation of Trademark and Collective Mark ===
An already registered trademark may be invalidated on two grounds, namely; 
* Where it is proved that the registered trademark did not comply with any of the requirements in the Act.

* Where the registered trademark has become a common name in the trade for goods or services for which it is registered.&lt;ref&gt;The Act, s 12&lt;/ref&gt; 
An already registered collective mark may be invalidated on three grounds, namely; 
* Where only the registered owner uses the trademark to the exclusion of any other enterprises 

* Where the registered owner permits the use of the trademark in contravention of the regulations of the collective mark

* Where the registered owner uses or permits the use of the trademark such a way as will likely to cause confusion to trade circles or the public as to the origin of the goods or services concerned.&lt;ref&gt;The Act, s 13&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Removal of Trademark and Collective Mark from Registration for Non-use ===
An already registered trademark, although not invalid, may be removed from the register of trademarks where a person interested in a trademark requests the Registrar to remove a trademark from the register because the trademark had not been used for a continuous period of five years or more.&lt;ref&gt;The Act, s 14&lt;/ref&gt; A collective mark may also be removed from the register in accordance with the procedure applied to trademarks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Change in Ownership of a Trademark and Collective Mark ===
An application for a change in the ownership of a trademark or collective mark shall be in writing and be filed with the Registrar.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;The Act, s 15&lt;/ref&gt; The owner of a trademark may transfer the trademark in whole or in part for the goods or services for which it has been registered.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Also where a person transfers an enterprise's, it is impliedly deemed that such a person has also transferred the trademark rights of the enterprise.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Licence Contract ===
A licence contract concerning the registration of a trademark or an application for registration shall be filed with the Registrar for which the contents shall be kept confidential but a reference to it will be published and if the said licence contract is not properly filed with the Registrar it is ineffective against third parties. For a licence contract to be valid, the licensor must have effective control over the quality of the goods or services of the licensee in connection with which the mark is used.&lt;ref&gt;The Act, s 16&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agency ===
An applicant who has a registered trademark in Ghana but is an ordinary resident outside of Ghana's jurisdiction must be represented by a legal practitioner resident in the country.&lt;ref&gt;The Act, s 17&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Trademark Registry ==

=== The Trademark Register ===
The registry is mandated to make a register of trademarks for keeping records of all registered trademarks. In cases of collective marks (trademarks of companies) the registry is required to provide a special section in the register to keep them.&lt;ref&gt;The Act, s 19&lt;/ref&gt; Application for a trademark is to be in writing and it would only be granted if it is applied directly for a trade description or applied to goods; or it is applied to a covering label, reel, or any other thing in which the goods are sold or manufactured.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;The Act, s 23&lt;/ref&gt; After the application has been granted, a person (whether natural or legal) could be represented by the said trademark, the person is entitled to use it in businesses or in any kind of advertisement.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

An entry in the register would be rectified or erased upon request where there has been an omission, error or a defect in the registration by the affected person. This request may be made to the registrar who further forwards the application to the high court. The application for rectification does not in any way affect the validation of the trademark unless it found that the trademark was made fraudulently.&lt;ref&gt;The Act, s 20&lt;/ref&gt; The time for correction of the errors may be extended on notice to the parties concerned and on the terms directed by the Registrar.&lt;ref&gt;The Act, s 22&lt;/ref&gt; The register as provided by the act is opened to the public; it is to be published in the gazette.&lt;ref&gt;The Act, s 21&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Trade Description and Fraudulent Marks ==

=== Offences under the Act ===
An offence under The Act is any offence that is in relation to the unauthorised use of a trademark in relation to goods or any offence involving dishonesty and deception with a trademark.

A person is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding five hundred penalty units or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years or to both the fine and the imprisonment when he applies a false trade description to goods; or forges a trademark; or use or possesses an article or instrument to forge a trademark; or sells or exposes for sale or for any purpose of trade or manufacture goods or things to which a forged trademark or false trade description is applied.  In cases where prosecution for an offence where goods are imported, evidence of the port of shipment is ''prima facie'' evidence of the place of origin of the goods.

Where a person is convicted of an offence the goods and things of any kind by means of or in relation to which the offence is committed are liable, at the discretion of the Court, to be surrendered to the State.

However, a person may not be prosecuted after three years from the commission of the offence, or one year after the first discovery of the commission, by the prosecutor, whichever occurs first.

Again a person for the purpose of gain or the intent to cause loss to an owner of a trademark applies that trademark or a trademark that is likely to be mistaken for a registered one to goods or labelling or advertising of goods or as a business paper in relation to goods or has possession of goods with that sign of trademark, or has an article in possession his or her control or in the course of business with the intent to sell ,hire or distribute for any purpose of trade commits an offence and is liable on a summary conviction to a fine of not less than two thousand penalty units and not more than seven thousand penalty units or to a term of imprisonment not less than five years and not more than fifteen years or both. A person who is charged with these offences is not entitled to bail, food, drugs, medical services, household chemicals, cosmetics, vehicle machine parts or electrical appliances.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Defences ===
A person may claim the acts done were of pure intent thus not for defrauding purposes. Also, he could claim he in good faith believed the trademark was genuine. Again reasonable precautions were taken against committing the offence charged or the relevant information was given to the police officer with respect to the persons on whose behalf the trademark, mark, or description was applied.&lt;ref&gt;The Act, s 27&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forfeiture of Goods ===
A person may apply to the court for an order for the forfeiture goods which bears an identical sign or likely to be mistaken to his and are in connection with the investigation or prosecution of an offence for the court to release the goods materials or articles on condition that the person causes the sign to be obliterated and complies with any order to pay costs which has been made against that person. A person aggrieved by the order of the decision of the court may appeal.&lt;ref&gt;The Amendment, s 10&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implied Warranty on the Sale of Goods ===
A buyer is mandated to accept trademarked good or trade description from a seller if there are no issues of fraud or forgery to the trademarked good.&lt;ref&gt;The Act, s 31&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functions of Registrar and Legal Proceedings ==
The Act deals with the power of the Registrar to award costs. The Registrar may award costs and direct how and by which parties they are to be paid in proceedings under the Act. By leave of the court, order for costs may be enforced in the same manner as a judgement or order of the court.&lt;ref&gt;The Act, s 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Per the Act in all legal proceedings relating to a registered trade mark, registration of the trademark by the owner shall be ''prima facie'' evidence of the validity of the original registration of the trade mark and all subsequent assignments and transmission of it.&lt;ref&gt;The Act, s 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The certificate of validity. In legal proceedings, where there is an issue about the validity of the registration of a registered trademark, the court may certify validity in favour of the owner. In subsequent legal proceedings concerning validity, the owner of the trade mark is entitled to costs and expenses between legal practitioner and client on obtaining a final judgement, unless the court certifies otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;The Act, s 36&lt;/ref&gt; The orders of the Registrar are subject to judicial appeal.&lt;ref&gt;The Act, s 39&lt;/ref&gt; The Act provides the procedure for where an applicant has an option to make an application to the court or to Registrar. The application shall be made to the court if an action concerning the trademark in question is before the Court; or where the application is to the Registrar, the Registrar may refer the application to the court at any stage of the proceedings or may determine the question.&lt;ref&gt;The Act, s 31&lt;/ref&gt;

A copy of any entry in the register, purporting to be certified and sealed with the official seal of the Registrar shall be admissible in a court without further proof of the original. Also, a person may obtain a certified copy of a register entry from the Registrar on payment of the prescribed fee.&lt;ref&gt;The Act, s 42&lt;/ref&gt;

== Miscellaneous provisions ==

=== Falsification of Entries in Register ===
Under the Act, it is provided that a person who knowingly makes or causes a false entry to be made in the register commits an offence and is fixed with the liability of summary conviction of a fine not exceeding five hundred penalty unit and a term of imprisonment not exceeding one year or both.&lt;ref&gt;The Act, s 44&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Offences of Falsely Representing a Trademark as Registered ===
Per the Act it is an offence to negligently make a fraudulent representation for the purpose of falsely representing a trademark as registered, or that a partly registered trademark is separately registered as a Trademark or that a registered trademark is registered in respect of specific goods or that a registered trademark gives an exclusive right to use taking into account the limitations entered on the register. The offender shall be liable to imprisonment, fine or both. However, the continuance of offence attract a further fine for each day during this continuation.&lt;ref&gt;The Act, s 45&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the USA first successful fraud case of ''In Re Bose Cooperation''.&lt;ref&gt;91 U. S. P. Q 2d 1938( federal Circuit 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Hexwave Inc, filed a use-based application to register the mark Hexwave, for a variety of electronic goods it claimed to be using in commerce. Bose corporation (“Bose”) opposed Hexwave's application based on fraud and likelihood of confusion with Bose’s registered WAVE Mark for a variety of electronic goods. Hexwave filed a counterclaim to cancel Bose’s registration on grounds of fraud and furnished evidence in this regard. Bose insisted that its renewal application was based on its honest, good faith belief that its receipt, repair and return of its previously sold audio tape recorder and players bearing wave Mark was sufficient to support its renewal application. The court held that trademark was obtained, procured or maintained fraudulently when an applicant or registrant makes false, material representation of fact in connection with a trademark application or registration with the intent to deceive the patent and trademark office.
