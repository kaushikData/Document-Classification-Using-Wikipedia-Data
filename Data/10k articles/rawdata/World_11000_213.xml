On February 10, 2007, [[Kosovo Albanians]] protested against the [[Ahtisaari Plan]]. The crowd in Pristina protested against a UN plan on the future status of [[Kosovo]]. Many ethnic Albanians were unhappy that the plan fell short of granting full independence for Kosovo. The proposals, unveiled on February 2 by chief UN envoy [[Martti Ahtisaari]], recommended a form of self-rule - which in itself was strongly opposed by Serbia. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Two dead following Kosovo clashes |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6351575.stm |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arben Xheladini and Mon Balaj were killed on February 10, 2007, during a demonstration after the [[Romanian Police]] serving in the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, UNMIK, fired rubber bullets. Others were seriously injured. The international rights watchdog Amnesty International urged the UN Special Representative in Kosovo to persuade the UN mission in Kosovo, UNMIK, to apologize for the “failure to protect the lives of Mon Balaj and Arben Xheladini ... and provide the complainants with full reparation for the damage suffered”. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Amnesty Seeks Justice for Killed Kosovo Protesters |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/amnesty-calls-un-to-bring-justice-to-two-killed-kosovo-albanians-02-09-2017 |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''600 Seconds''''' ({{lang-ru|600 секунд}}; 1987 to 1993) was an immensely popular TV news program that aired in the [[Soviet Union]] and briefly in [[post-Soviet]] [[Russia]]. It was a nightly broadcast from [[Leningrad TV]] with [[news presenter|anchor]] [[Alexander Nevzorov]].&lt;ref name=nyt090789&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/07/arts/hip-hot-and-hyper-soviet-tv-cuts-loose.html?pagewanted=all " Hip, Hot and Hyper: Soviet TV Cuts Loose"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 7, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

The program of the ''[[glasnost]]'' period was distinguished by its fast tempo and the display of the countdown from 600 to zero.&lt;ref name=nyt090789/&gt; The anchor Nevzorov used the broadcast in order to criticize corrupt Soviet officials and promote preserving the Soviet Union (in the Baltic States, he is known as a fierce opponent of the national independence movements). Later – during the early [[Boris Yeltsin|Yeltsin]] years – the broadcast became a mouthpiece of Russian Nationalist opposition to Yeltsin's policies and was banned twice – definitively after Yeltsin's [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|victory in his conflict]] with the rebel parliament.  The [[Letter of Forty-Two]] called for it to be cancelled.&lt;ref name=letter&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Писатели требуют от правительства решительных действий |url=http://vivovoco.rsl.ru/VV/PAPERS/HONOUR/LETT42.HTM |accessdate=21 August 2011 |newspaper=[[Izvestia]] |date=5 October 1993 |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716043414/http://vivovoco.rsl.ru/VV/PAPERS/HONOUR/LETT42.HTM |archivedate=16 July 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
{{Main|Animax Asia|Animax (South Korea)}}
Animax launched separate Asian versions of the channel featuring its anime programming within separate networks and feeds in the respective regions and languages beginning in 2004. The first one was launched in [[Taiwan]] and the [[Philippines]] on January 1, 2004, and in [[Hong Kong]] on January 12, 2004. A week later, Animax launched in [[Southeast Asia]] on January 19, 2004, featuring its programming within feeds in [[English language|English]] audio, as well as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] audio, with English subtitling, and other languages in the region, becoming the company's first English-language network.&lt;ref name="Asia"&gt;''[http://www.animax-asia.com/corporate/default.asp Animax Asia - Corporate Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614202738/http://www.animax-asia.com/corporate/default.asp |date=2006-06-14}}'' - ''Animax Asia official website''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 5, 2004, Animax started operations across [[South Asia]] including [[Animax (India)|India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nepal]] and [[Maldives]], featuring its programming within an English-language feed. On April 29, 2006, Animax started its operations in South Korea, broadcasting separately from Seoul.&lt;ref name="ann-launchinkorea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2006-04-24/animax-crashes-korea-on-saturday|title=Animax Crashes Korea on Saturday|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-10-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071029223812/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2006-04-24/animax-crashes-korea-on-saturday| archivedate= 29 October 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, 2006, Animax launched its [[Malaysia]]n feed.

Animax used the latest logo launched on May 3, 2010, until it reverted to their previous logo sometime in 2013.

Animax ceased its operations in India and was replaced by Sony Yay on April 18, 2017. The channel later moved to its digital platform Sony LIV in HD and Asian feed instead.

===Latin America===
{{main|Animax (Latin America)}}
Animax was launched in [[Latin America]] on July 31, 2005, replacing [[Locomotion (TV channel)|Locomotion]] after Sony's purchase from [[Hearst Corporation]] and [[Corus Entertainment]], in January 2005.&lt;ref&gt;"Silex-IT Client Case Studies" [http://www.silex-it.com/static/resources/16.pdf Animax Channel Client Profile: Sony Corporation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105163441/http://www.silex-it.com/static/resources/16.pdf |date=January 5, 2009 }} silex-it.com Retrieved on May 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The channel's non-anime programming were removed from the lineup, which was later replaced with an all-anime lineup. Animax Latin America began operating across the entire region and broadcasting its anime programming. Unlike Animax's networks in other countries, Animax Latin America was distributed by [[HBO Latin America Group]] under license from Sony.

The network's initial programming lineup consisted of shows that originally aired on [[Locomotion (TV channel)|Locomotion]], which were ''[[Saber Marionette#Saber Marionette J|Saber Marionette J]]'', ''[[Saber Marionette#Saber Marionette J to X|Saber Marionette J to X]]'', ''[[Soul Hunter (anime)|Soul Hunter/Senkai-den Hōshin Engi]]'', ''[[Serial Experiments Lain]]'', ''[[The Candidate for Goddess]]'' and ''[[Earth Girl Arjuna]]'', and newer series such as ''[[Di Gi Charat Nyo!]]'', ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]'', ''[[GetBackers]]'', ''[[.hack//Sign]]'', ''[[Hellsing (anime)|Hellsing]]'', ''[[Hungry Heart: Wild Striker]]'', ''[[Hunter × Hunter]]'', ''[[Initial D]]'', ''[[Last Exile]]'', ''[[Lunar Legend Tsukihime]]'', ''[[Martian Successor Nadesico]]'', ''[[Pita-Ten]]'', ''[[The Prince of Tennis]]'', ''[[Crayon Shin-chan]]'', ''[[Stratos 4]]'', and ''[[Vandread]]'' (which [[Locomotion (TV channel)|Locomotion]] intended to air).

Over the years, Animax has aired various anime series, with the Spanish versions being dubbed in [[Venezuela]] by Estudios Lain and after in [[Mexico]], and the Portuguese versions dubbed in Brazil, most of whom have never been shown before locally. Its programs include, ''[[Noir (anime)|Noir]]'', ''[[Wolf's Rain]]'',  ''[[Twin Spica]]'', ''[[Planet Survival]]'', ''[[Excel Saga]]'' (which [[Locomotion (TV channel)|Locomotion]] intended to air), ''[[Samurai 7]]'', ''[[Gun Frontier]]'', ''[[Gantz]]'', ''[[Heat Guy J]]'', ''[[Galaxy Angel]]'', ''[[Burst Angel]]'',  ''[[Blood+]]'', ''[[Hell Girl]]'', ''[[Mushishi]]'', ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'', ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' (which previously aired on Locomotion), ''[[Rurouni Kenshin|Samurai X]]'', ''[[The Mythical Detective Loki Ragnarok]]'', ''[[Death Note]]'', ''[[Fate Stay Night]]'', ''[[Black Cat (anime)|Black Cat]]'', ''[[SoltyRei]]'', ''[[R.O.D. The TV]]'', ''[[xxxHolic]]'', ''[[Bokurano]]'', ''[[Yōkai Ningen Bem|Humanoid Monster Bem]]'', ''[[Speed Grapher]]'', ''[[Basilisk]]'', ''[[Trinity Blood]]'', ''[[Black Jack (manga)|Black Jack]]'', ''[[Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo|Gankutsuou]]'', ''[[Legend of Blue]]'', ''[[009-1]]'' and ''[[Musumet]]''.

Starting January 2007, Animax changed its lineup and some anime series were removed. Animax Latin America announced a new rebrand from August 2007, as well as the premiere of a new adult-oriented programming block (named ''Lollipop''). Likewise, on March 18, 2008, it was announced that the mobile service Animax Mobile, available on Japan and Australia, was to be launched as well in Mexico and eventually in other Latin American countries.&lt;ref name="animaxmobilela"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espanol.frecuenciaonline.com/home/contenidos.php?id=131&amp;identificaArticulo=2057|title=Las señales de TV alistan sus contenidos multiplataformas|author=Anabella Marciello|date=2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shift from anime to live-action programing====
Since late 2010, Animax Latin America had gradually shifted its focus from anime to more live-action programming, contrary to the network's programming and history in other regions; this led to several fans airing their discontent on the Latin American discussion forums, which were subsequently shut down in January 2011.&lt;ref name="anmtv.xpg.com.br"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anmtv.xpg.com.br/animax-anuncia-fechamento-de-seu-forum/ |title=Animax anuncia fechamento de seu fórum &amp;#124; Anime, Mangá e TV – ANMTV |publisher=Anmtv.xpg.com.br |date=2010-12-23 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anmtv.xpg.com.br"/&gt;

====Aftermath====
Animax Latin America was rebranded to '''[[Sony Spin]]''' on May 1, 2011, with anime retained at the late-night slot.&lt;ref&gt;This rebrand marked the disappearance of the Animax name from Latin America.&lt;/ref&gt; By March 2012, anime no longer aired on the channel. Sony Spin was discontinued on July 1, 2014 and replaced with a local version of [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]], an [[United States|American]] [[Women's interest channel|women's interest]] [[Cable network|cable]] and [[satellite]] [[television network]] that is owned and operated by [[Lifetime Entertainment Services]], a subsidiary of the [[A+E Networks]] joint venture between the [[Disney–ABC Television Group]] unit of the [[The Walt Disney Company#Disney Media Networks|Disney Media Networks]] subsidiary of [[The Walt Disney Company]] and [[Hearst (media)|Hearst Corporation]], which was announced on April 23, 2014 by Sony Pictures Television in association with A+E Networks' [[A+E Networks#A+E Networks Latin America|Latin American division]], which was the company's joint venture with Ole Communications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ae-networks-latin-america-and-sony-pictures-television-to-launch-lifetime-in-latin-america-256290091.html|title=Lifetime to Launch in Latin America as Joint Venture Between A+E Networks Latin America and Sony Pictures Television Distributed by HBO Latin America Group|website=PR Newswire}}&lt;/ref&gt; and currently distributed by HBO Latin America Group from its launch down (similar to its predecessor Sony Spin when that channel was known as Animax).

===North America===
Animax has sponsored several anime-based events across [[North America]], including hosting an anime festival, in association with other anime distributive enterprises such as [[Bandai Entertainment]] and [[Viz Media]], across Sony's [[San Francisco]]-based entertainment shopping complex [[Metreon]] in October 2001, during which it aired numerous of its anime titles across the centre, including special ''[[Gundam]]'', ''[[Metropolis (2001 film)|The Making of Metropolis]]'', and ''[[Love Hina]]'' screenings.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/article.php?id=1081 Sony Metreon media release]'', ''Anime News Network'', 9 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

====[[Sony]] plans to launch Animax as cable TV channel in North America along with [[Comcast]]====
The noted international business newspaper ''[[Financial Times]]'', reported, in September 2004, of Sony planning and being "keen" to launch Animax across the United States and North America, after Sony had signed an agreement with the largest [[cable television|cable company]] in the United States, [[Comcast]], with whom it had co-partnered in a US$4.8 billion acquisition of legendary [[Hollywood]] studio [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], to bring at least three of Sony's television networks across the region.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.ft.com/cms/s/7ab174d4-0cc6-11d9-b543-00000e2511c8.html Sony and Comcast plan new channels]'', Tim Burt, ''[[Financial Times]]'', 22 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/article.php?id=5528 Animax could be available in North America soon.]'', ''Anime News Network'', 23 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

====[[#Animax Mobile|Animax Mobile]] enters into [[Canada]]====
On June 13, 2007, Sony Pictures Television International officially announced that Animax would be launching its mobile television service, Animax Mobile, in [[Canada]] from July 2007, on [[Bell Mobility|Bell Digital]]'s mobile phone service.&lt;ref name="spti-animaxmobile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2007-06-13/sony-pictures-television-international's-global-animax-brand-goes-mobile|title=Sony Pictures Television International's Global Animax Brand Goes Mobile|publisher=Sony Pictures Television International|date=2007-06-13|accessdate=2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was Animax Mobile's third major expansion, after initially launching the mobile television service in Japan from April 2007 and [[Australia]] from June 12, 2007.&lt;ref name="animaxmobile-ann"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-06-15/sony's-animax-channel-goes-mobile-in-australia-further-information|title=Sony's Animax Channel Goes Mobile in Australia - Further Information|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2007-06-15|accessdate=2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17, 2012, the streaming service [[Crackle.com|Crackle]], added Animax to their lineup&lt;ref name="Animax Launches on Crackle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2012-01-17/animax-launches-on-crackle |title=Animax Launches on Crackle |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2012-01-17 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the North America region, marking the network's first launch in the United States (although not on television). Its programming has included for the first time several of Animax's English language dubs, including that of shows that had never yet been adapted into English and had only aired in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]] prior, such as ''[[Nodame Cantabile]]'', ''[[Yōkai Ningen Bem]]'' and several others. Towards the end of 2013, the Animax branding was dropped, though Crackle continues to stream anime titles.

===Europe===
{{See also|Animax Eastern Europe}}
In April 2007, Animax launched across several countries in [[Europe]], including [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], with Sony announcing plans to launch in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[France]], [[Poland]] (put on hiatus) and other major countries in the continent, with discussions at an advanced stage.&lt;ref name="c21media"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/news/detail.asp?area=79&amp;article=35237|title=Sony drives Animax across Europe|accessdate=2007-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="worldscreen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldscreen.com/newscurrent.php?filename=spti041107.htm|title=Animax Heads to Europe|accessdate=2007-04-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070504115119/http://www.worldscreen.com/newscurrent.php?filename=spti041107.htm  |archivedate = 2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch marked Animax's first major expansion into Europe.&lt;ref name="c21media"/&gt;&lt;ref name="worldscreen"/&gt; The network then soon launched in [[Germany]] in May 2007, [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] in 2008.

The channel was closed on 31 March 2014.

====United Kingdom====
In October 2007, further details emerged on Animax's launch details in the United Kingdom, with Sony Pictures Television International senior-vice president of international networks Ross Hair being quoted by Brand Republic's ''Media Week'' as stating that Sony was preparing to launch Animax in the United Kingdom initially as a [[video on demand]] service alongside other Sony television networks, with Sony also looking at launching Animax across the free [[digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom|digital television service]] [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] subject to new frequencies and slot being available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/745080/Sony-pay-TV-channels-will-UK-VoD-services/|title=Sony pay-TV channels will come to UK as VoD services|author=Tristan O'Carroll|publisher=Media Week|date=2007-10-16|accessdate=2007-10-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081206161253/http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/745080/Sony-pay-TV-channels-will-UK-VoD-services/| archivedate=December 6, 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2011, one of Sony's 3 channels that they were planning to launch in the UK since 2007, [[Sony Entertainment Television (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sony Entertainment Television]], is now available there on [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]] following Sony's acquisition of channel slots 157 and 190, which were previously owned by [[Film 24 (channel)|Film 24]] and [[Open Access (UK and Ireland TV channels)|Open Access 3]], respectively, not only making it now possible that Sony can launch Animax in the UK but also marking [[Sony Pictures Television]]'s entry into both the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] markets. On October 15, 2013, Sony Pictures Television announced it will launch a UK version of Animax as a SVOD service. SPT also announced a multi-year volume deal with Viz Media to secure exclusive content for the service.&lt;ref&gt;http://sonypicturestelevision.com/landings/spt/aboutspt/viewPR.php?id=195{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SVOD service launched online on October 24, 2013, with three simulcast series and over twenty archive series&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uk-anime.net/newsitem/Animax_UK_now_online.html&lt;/ref&gt; including many titles which originally debuted on Kaze's Anime On Demand service. Some content has also appeared on [[Sony Movie Channel]]'s Late Night Anime block,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sonymoviechannel.co.uk/programs/late-night-anime&lt;/ref&gt; with the channel's website referencing Animax. Starting from March 2014, the Late Night Anime block has since been rebranded to Animax. An app for [[PlayStation 4]] was released in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2014-10-08/animax-expands-onto-ps4/.79696|title=Animax Expands onto PS4|publisher=Anime News Network|date=2014-10-08|accessdate=January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 5, 2015, [[Scuzz]] launched ''Animax Movie Nights'', a weekly block that aired anime movies on Thursday nights for the next month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uk-anime.net/newsitem/Scuzz_TV_launch_Animax_Movie_Nights.html|title=Scuzz TV launch Animax Movie Nights|publisher=UK Anime Network|date=March 2, 2015|accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 2018 the service will be closed down and subscribers are being directed to [[Funimation]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.animaxtv.co.uk/|title=Animax|last=|first=|date=07/10/2018|website=Animax UK homepage|archive-url=https://www.animaxtv.co.uk/|archive-date=07/10/2018|dead-url=|access-date=07/10/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hungary, Romania, Czech Republic and Slovakia====
In 2006, [[Sony Pictures Television International]] bought the satellite/cable TV station A+ Anime, re-branding it as Animax in 2007. At first Animax only broadcast series that it had previously purchased, but later bought new series, often with Czech dubbing.
In 2010, the channel changed its focus, targeting a more broad young adult audience and adding more American television series. At the same time, the channel dropped support of its forums on its website and, in September 2013, closed them entirely. From the end of 2013, rumors circulated that the channel would be shutting down. On March 31, 2014, the channel was indeed closed down and replaced with [[AMC Networks International Central Europe|C8]].

Meanwhile, in Romania, AXN Spin was launched on 1 March 2013 on RomTelecom's digital lineup, a few months after both Minimax and Animax were dropped from that platform. AXN Spin's schedule resembled Animax's schedule from that time, but with Animax closed in March 2014 and with the rights expired for all acquired content, AXN Spin doesn't air anime anymore. It is uncertain the channel's future as the schedule mainly consists in reruns from AXN, AXN Black and AXN White, without any adverts or self-promotions. Interestingly, AXN Spin is also available in Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia, countries in which neither AXN Black or AXN White have been launched.

====Spain and Portugal====
{{See also|Animax Spain|Animax Portugal}}
Animax began as a programming block in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] in the channel [[AXN]]. Shows broadcast on the block include ''[[InuYasha]]'', ''[[Outlaw Star]]'', ''[[Trigun]]'', ''[[Orphen]]'', ''[[Excel Saga]]'' and ''[[Samurai Champloo]]''. Later shows include ''[[Corrector Yui]]'', ''[[The Law of Ueki]]'', ''[[Detective Conan]]'', ''[[Lupin III]]'' and ''[[Kochikame]]''. These shows were shown in Portugal and Spain from October 2007 until September 2008, airing weekends from 13:00 to 16:00.

The full channel was subsequently launched on April 12, 2008 on the [[Movistar TV]] and [[Digital+]] platforms in Spain and [[Meo (Portugal)|Meo]] and [[Clix (ISP)|Clix]] in Portugal. Among the series broadcast across Animax's networks in Spain and Portugal were  ''[[Nana (manga)|Nana]]'', ''[[Black Lagoon]]'', ''[[Love Hina]]'', ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'', ''[[Chobits]]'', ''[[Devil May Cry: The Animated Series|Devil May Cry]]''. As of 2011, the Portuguese feed was removed due to low ratings and was replaced by AXN Black, an offshoot of AXN. In 2013, the Spanish feed rebranded and eliminated all of its western programming in favor for anime, although the programming consisted on continuous reruns of four anime, later reduced to two. On December 31, 2013, the Spanish feed was also removed due to its low ratings.

====Italy====
Animax in Italy began as a nighttime 1-hour programming block on sister channel [[AXN|AXN Italy]] on January 12, 2008, indicating that it will eventually launch as a 24/7 channel. The programs that aired on the block were ''[[Planetes]]'', ''[[The Vision of Escaflowne]]'', ''[[.hack//SIGN]]'', and ''[[Noein]]''. The block hasn't aired since 2009, likely to avoid competition with [[MTV Italy|MTV]], who also aired anime and was more widely available.

====Germany====

On May 14, 2007, Sony announced Animax would be launching in [[Germany]] from early June 2007, becoming the country's first ever television network solely dedicated to anime programming.&lt;ref name="animaxgermany-pressrelease"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2007-05-14/animax-the-anime-channel-from-sony-pictures-television-international-to-launch-in-germany |title=Animax, the {{Sic|Anim|é|nolink=yes}} Channel from Sony Pictures Television International, to Launch in Germany |date=2007-05-14 |accessdate=2007-05-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516184011/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2007-05-14/animax-the-anime-channel-from-sony-pictures-television-international-to-launch-in-germany |archivedate=16 May 2007 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117964887.html?categoryId=1050&amp;cs=1|title=Animax toons in Teutons|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2007-05-15|accessdate=2007-05-14 | first=Steve | last=Clarke| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070526203638/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117964887.html?categoryid=1050&amp;cs=1| archivedate= 26 May 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ann-animaxgermany"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-05-14/animax-channel-expands-into-germany-with-unity-media|title=Animax Channel Expands into Germany with Unity Media|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2007-05-14|accessdate=2007-05-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070626024046/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-05-14/animax-channel-expands-into-germany-with-unity-media| archivedate= 26 June 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animax launched in the country from June 5, 2007 on Unity Media's digital subscription television service in the regions of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Hesse]] and other regions.&lt;ref name="animaxgermany-pressrelease"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ann-animaxgermany"/&gt;&lt;ref name="variety-animaxgermany"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117966582.html?categoryId=2525&amp;cs=1|title=Sony launches anime channel|author=Ed Meza|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|date=2007-06-08|accessdate=2007-06-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070611120239/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117966582.html?categoryid=2525&amp;cs=1| archivedate= 11 June 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the first anime series premiering on Animax Germany were ''[[.hack//Sign]]'', ''[[Dragon Ball]]'', ''[[Earth Girl Arjuna]]'', ''[[Eureka Seven]]'', ''[[Gundam SEED]]'', ''[[Oh My Goddess!]]'', ''[[One Piece]]'', ''[[Record of Lodoss War]]'', ''[[School Rumble]]'', ''[[The Candidate for Goddess]]'', ''[[X (manga)|X]]'' and numerous others.&lt;ref name="variety-animaxgermany"/&gt;&lt;ref name="animaxgermany"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animaxtv.de/|title=Animax Germany official website|accessdate=2007-05-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070524123815/http://www.animaxtv.de/| archivedate= 24 May 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel later launched into Austria and Switzerland.

The TV channel closed on July 7, 2016, Animax continues as VOD in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

====Poland====
Start of network in [[Poland]] was in plans, following on other similar expansions around Central Europe. But currently, plans have stopped and there are no longer plans to do due to financial reasons. It was, however, available as a daily block on [[AXN Spin HD]] (which is an offshoot of AXN Poland) airing on late mornings, the afternoon, and sometimes late at night. Programs airing on the block included ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'', ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[Vampire Knight]]'', ''[[Kilari]]'', ''[[Deltora Quest (anime)|Deltora Quest]]'', ''[[D.gray-man]]'', ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos]]'', the ''[[Slayers]]'' series, and ''[[Soul Eater (manga)|Soul Eater]]''.

Previously, Animax had also been similarly launched as a three-hour programming block in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] on [[AXN]] (also similarly owned by Sony Pictures Entertainment), beginning from 2007 and then subsequently fully launching as a separate 24-hour anime network on April 12, 2008. As of 2016, the block is no longer on air.

Animax programming has also been available since June 12, 2007 through its mobile television service, Animax Mobile, available on [[Hutchison 3G|3 mobile]]'s 3G network.&lt;ref name="animaxmobile-ann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aap-animaxmobile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/mobiles--handhelds/anime-channel-for-mobiles/2007/06/14/1181414442380.html|title=Anime channel for mobiles|publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=2007-06-14|accessdate=2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its initial programming on launch consisted of four full-length anime series, ''[[Blood+]]'', ''[[R.O.D the TV]]'', ''[[Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' and ''[[Last Exile]]''.&lt;ref name="spti-animaxmobile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="animaxmobile-ann"/&gt; As of 2016 Animax Mobile doesn't exist anymore in Australia.

====South Africa====
The network began broadcasting on [[DStv]] on November 3, 2007, until it was terminated on October 31, 2010, and featured English language programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mybroadband.co.za/news/Telecoms/1663.html|title=Five more channels for DSTV|publisher=MyBroadband|date=2007-10-17|accessdate=2007-10-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071019015500/http://mybroadband.co.za/news/Telecoms/1663.html| archivedate= 19 October 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been lauded by publications such as ''[[The Sunday Times (South Africa)|The Times]]'' for having singularly spread awareness about anime than any other platform,&lt;ref name="times-za"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.za/PrintEdition/Article.aspx?id=910538|title=Anime Kingdom|author=Benji Pienaar|publisher=[[The Sunday Times (South Africa)|The Times]]|date=2009-01-04|accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and celebrated its first year of broadcasts in South Africa in November 2008.&lt;ref name="times-za"/&gt; Sony Pictures Television International manager Philipp Schmidt was quoted by ''The Times'' as saying that Animax's primary goal was to "establish itself as the destination for anime programming" in South Africa, and also that the feedback that it has received has shown it has been making an impact in the country.&lt;ref name="times-za"/&gt; Animax South Africa premiered programs such as ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (anime)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', ''[[Tenjo Tenge]]'', ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]'', ''[[Record of Lodoss War]]'', ''[[.hack//SIGN]]'', ''[[Negima!

'''''Anoplogaster cornuta''''', the '''common fangtooth''', is a [[species]] of deep sea fish found in temperate and tropical oceans worldwide. It is found at depths of from {{convert|2|to|5000|m|ft|-1}} with the adults usually found from {{convert|500|to|5000|m|ft|-1}} and the young usually found near the surface. This species grows to a [[fish measurement|total length]] of about {{convert|18|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}. While a source of food for [[pelagic]] carnivorous fishes, this species is of no interest for human [[Fishery|fisheries]].

==Description== 
The common fangtooth has a distinctive appearance and grows to a total length of about {{convert|18|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}. Adults are dark brown to black, the head is very large, bony and finely sculptured but does not bear any spines. The eye is small and the gill rakers have bony bases and are tooth-like. The body is deepest just behind the head, tapering rapidly to the caudal peduncle. The mouth is well-armed with sharp fangs and the skin is granular. The dorsal fin has no spines and 17 to 20 soft rays while the anal fin has no spines and 7 to 9 soft rays. The lateral line takes the form of an open groove, bridged in places by overlapping scales. Many deep sea fish do not have [[swim bladder]]s, but the common fangtooth does.&lt;ref name=Fitch&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fitch, John E.|author2=Lavenberg, Robert J.|title=Deep-water Teleostean Fishes of California |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9YfkpT5KEqoC&amp;pg=PA94 |year=1968 |publisher=University of California Press |pages=94–96 |id=GGKEY:8SEC4LN8T3G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FishBase&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fishbase.se/summary/Anoplogaster-cornuta.html |title=''Anoplogaster cornuta'' Valenciennes, 1833 |work=FishBase |accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juveniles look very different from adults, so much so that they were at one time believed to be a different species.&lt;ref name=Fitch/&gt; The juveniles were [[Species description|first described]] as ''Anoplogaster cornuta'' by the French zoologist [[Achille Valenciennes]] in 1833, and it was fifty years later that the adults were described and given the name ''Caulolepis longidens''. Not until 1955 was it appreciated that the two were the same species. The juveniles are a much paler colour and somewhat triangular in cross section. They have several long spines on the head, large eyes and slender, pointed gill rakers, but have small teeth and lack the fangs of the adult fish.&lt;ref name=Fitch/&gt;&lt;ref name=FishBase/&gt; The skin is largely unpigmented and clad in unpigmented scales, but there is a black patch on the belly formed by dark-coloured cup-like scales. As the juvenile reaches adulthood, it becomes darker as black scales grow to cover its still-unpigmented skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lee, Milton Oliver|author2= Llano, George Albert|title=Biology of the Antarctic Seas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6PYofJXWMJ0C&amp;pg=PA213 |year=1964 |publisher=American Geophysical Union |isbn=978-0-87590-105-3 |page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
The common fangtooth has a global distribution being found in tropical and temperate waters in both the eastern and western Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Off the western seaboard of America its range extends from British Columbia southwards to south of the equator. It is a [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] fish occurring between {{convert|2|and|5000|m|ft|-1}}, with adults between {{convert|500|to|5000|m|ft|-1}}; adults occur in deep water and are often caught in trawls at about {{convert|2000|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}. Juveniles are found at lesser depths.&lt;ref name=Fitch/&gt;

==Behaviour==
The common fangtooth is a predator and feeds on other fish, [[crustacean]]s and [[cephalopod]]s. They are themselves preyed on by such fish as [[tuna]], [[marlin]] and [[albacore]]. It is a schooling fish and is often found in small groups, though it may be solitary. Off the west coast of North America, the common fangtooth seems to breed in the summer months. The fish are [[Oviparity|oviparous]] and the developing larvae are [[plankton]]ic.&lt;ref name=FishBase/&gt; From examination of the [[otolith]]s (bony structures behind the eyes), it appears that this fish lives for at least three years.&lt;ref name=Fitch/&gt;

A '''Bough pot''' is a vessel for holding stems of flowers and branches to decorate a interior, especially a [[fireplace]] during summer.  They are typically ceramic, and have a body to hold water, with a number of small openings for the stems in the top. Often the top lifts off. The [[tulipiere]] and [[flower brick]] are types that allow larger numbers of flowers. 

The term "bough pot" was common in use in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/bough-pot&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During summer in Europe, the fireplace was not used in a house. Instead, they were decorated with floral arrangements. These arrangements consisted of vessels and pots, The term "bough pot" was a colloquial term and came to mean the pots that were used for decorating the fireplace.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.presentcompanyltd.co.uk/bough-pot/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Coat of arms of Kharkiv''' is the official [[coat of arms]] of both [[Kharkiv]] city and [[Kharkiv Oblast]].

It is also a historical flag of [[Sloboda Ukraine]].

==History==
The oldest arms of the city, known from the early 17th century, showed a bow and arrow. These arms, of unknown meaning or origin, were used until 1781. On September 21, 1781, the city was granted new arms, showing a [[Cornucopia|horn of plenty]] (cornucopia) and a staff of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] ([[caduceus]]), symbols for agriculture and trade.

On July 5, 1878 the arms were replaced. The new arms showed a horse-head, symbol for the famous stud farms in the city, with in the chief two coins and a star (see above). The coins symbolised trade and wealth, the star the new university. These arms were, at the request of the nobility, replaced by the old 1781 arms again on May 21, 1887.

[[File:Полтавський шлях, 67.jpg|thumbnail|right|A mosaic with the Soviet coat of arms of the city.]]
The arms with the staff and cornucopia remained in use until 1918. During Soviet times the city had no official arms until December 26, 1968. The new arms were a typical example of Soviet heraldry, showing a wheel for industry, an atom for knowledge and a wheat-ear for agriculture, as well as the name of the city.

Finally, on September 14, 1995, the city council adopted the arms from 1878 again as the new city arms.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Description==

The coat of arms consists of a verdant shield with gold trim. A [[caduceus]] and a [[cornucopia]] are crossed on it. The caduceus symbolises commerce, while the cornucopia, also called the "horn of plenty", emphasises an abundance of food. The shield is wreathed with golden oak leaves tied with a blue ribbon. The upper half of a [[sprocket]] is visible above the shield, symbolising industry. Four stalks of [[rye]], two on either side of the sprocket, symbolise agriculture. The sprocket is surmounted by an open book with an [[atom]]ic symbol, symbolising [[education]] and [[science]].

The city of [[Ragusa, Sicily]] has similar heraldic combination (caduceus and cornucopia).

It is divided administratively into two [[woreda]]s, the city proper and the non-urban woreda of [[Gurgura]]. 
  
Dire Dawa lies in the eastern part of the nation, on the [[Dechatu River]], at the foot of a ring of cliffs that has been described as "somewhat like a cluster of tea-leaves in the bottom of a slop-basin."&lt;ref&gt;C.F.

At a latitude and longitude of {{coord|9|36|N|41|52|E|region:ET-DD_type:city(398000)|display=inline,title}}, Dire Dawa is the second largest city in Ethiopia.

The city is an industrial centre, home to several [[market (place)|market]]s and the [[Aba Tenna Dejazmach Yilma International Airport]].The city was first founded and settled by the Gurgure clan of Dir and now is home of many different people from all over Ethiopia.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The region of Dire Dawa was already populated by human beings in Mesolithic times, as revealed by rock paintings and Middle-Stone-Age artifacts in the cave of Porc-Épic, only a few kilometers from Dire Dawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perlès|first=Catherine|date=1974|title=Réexamen typologique de l'industrie du Porc Épic (Éthiopie): les pointes et pièces pointues|url=|journal=L'Archéologie|volume=78|pages=529-552|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=John|last2=Williams|first2=Kenneth|last3=Michaels|first3=Joseph|last4=Marean|first4=Curtis|date=1984|title=A Middle Stone Age Occupation Site at Porc Epic at Dire Dawa (East-Central Ethiopia)|url=|journal=African Archaeological Review|volume=2|pages=37-71|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Dire Dawa Station.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Dire Dawa Railway Station]]
Historically, the city of Dire Dawa was originally called Dir Dhabe and used to be part of [[Adal Sultanate]] during the medieval times and was exclusively settled by the [[Gurgure]] [[Dir (clan)|Dir]] clan which is a major Somali tribe and after the weakening of Adal Sultanate, the [[Oromos]] took advantage and were able to penetrate through the city and settle into these areas and also assimilate some of the local [[Gurgura]] clan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YgIwAQAAIAAJ |title=The conquest of Abyssinia: 16th century|last=ʻArabfaqīh|first=Shihāb al-Dīn Aḥmad ibn ʻAbd al-Qādir |date=2003-01-01 |publisher=Tsehai Publishers &amp; Distributors |others=Annotation: Dir, According to Huntingford a settlement which may be modern Dire Dawa. |year= |isbn= |location= |page=24 |pages= |language=en |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1902-1936 ===
The present-day town of Dire Dawa ((311 km by rail from Djibouti), however, is of very recent origin. It owes its foundation to a technical problem: when it became impossible to lay the [[Ethio-Djibouti Railways|Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway]] via [[Harar]] because of the steep access to the town, ''atse'' [[Menelik II]] accepted (in a later dated 5 November 1896) that the first part of the line might finish at a village at the foot of the mountains, which should be named Addis Harar ("New Harrar").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The railway reached this location on 24 December 1902, a date which may be considered the day of Dire Dawa's foundation. The new name, however, did not win recognition. In the long run, the local name Dire Dawa was generally accepted. Dire Dawa most probably derives from [[Somali language|Somali]] ''Dir dabo'' (limit of the Dir confederation of the Somali) and popularly etymologizes in its [[Amharic]] form as "hill of uncultivated land".

For financial and diplomatic reasons the railway was not continued until 1909 and the final inauguration of the whole line from Djibouti to Addis Ababa-again delayed by the revolution of 1916-only took place on 7 Jun 1917. During all this time, Dire Dawa was practically the town profited much and became a "boom city", attracting most of the trade which formerly passed through Harar. By 1902 the Ethiopian government, anticipating the future economic importance of Dire Dawa, had already transferred the customs station for trade with the Red Sea from Gildessa to Dire Dawa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Dire Dawa developed into two settlements separated by the [[Dechatu River|Dekato River]], which was dry for most of the year and became a torrent only when it rained. The north-western part of the town was planned and constructed very regularly, mostly by the engineers of the railway company. At first, this part of the town mostly housed the employees of the railway company, but it later attracted, besides the French, also Greeks, Armenians, other Europeans and Arabs, who opened shops and hotels and founded some industry as well. In 1909 the French Capuchin Mission settled in Dire Dawa. At that time Dire Dawa looked like a French town.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The other part of the town, southeast of the river, concentrated around the market and was inhabited mainly by Ethiopian, Somali and a few Arab traders.

In September 1916 the fleeing troops of ''lij'' [[Iyasu V|Iyasu]] took hold of the town. Though ''lij'' Iyasu's governor there, the Syrian Hasib al-Idlibi, assured their security, 400 Europeans left the town and the rail traffic had to be suspended. After the battle of Maeso, the governmental troops from Addis Ababa re-established a regular administration.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le chemin de fer de Djibouti à Addis-Abeba|last=van Gelder de Pineda|first=Rosanna|publisher=Harmattan|year=1995|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=268-271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s, the south-eastern part of the town also started to develop. Its inhabitants were mostly Somali and Oromo, the other Ethiopians playing only a minor role. The population here grew to 3,000, while that of the whole town numbered 20,000. Between the two World Wars, two hospitals were established in Dire Dawa, one by the railway company and another in 1934 by the government. Education on a primary level was provided by a government school, a Catholic mission school and several schools for the different foreign communities in the town (Greek, Italian, Indian).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Ethiopian Towns: from the Mid-Nineteenth Century to 1935|last=Pankhurst|first=Richard|publisher=|year=1985|isbn=|location=Stuttgart|pages=271-274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dire Dawa's first governor was [[Ato Mersha Nahusenay]]. Formerly the governor of the strategic village of Gildessa and its environs, Mersha was instrumental in the construction of the first railway and establishment of the railway city.&lt;ref&gt;Pankhurst (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bekele, Shiferaw (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; The imperial railway company (Cie) played a key role in the early development of the city, particularly Gezira (aka Kezira), under the authority of the Ethiopian government. The original failed company was reörganized as the joint-government [[Franco-Ethiopian Railway]] in 1908 and, after a period of financial negotiation and recapitalization, construction began anew, linking the city with the Ethiopian capital [[Addis Ababa]] in 1917. The Dire Dawa-Harar road was improved in 1928, shortening the travel time to only a few hours.&lt;ref&gt;Pankhurst, Richard R.K. ''An Economic History of Ethiopia'', pp.&amp;nbsp;289&amp;ndash;290. Haile Selassie University Press (Addis Ababa), 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, the [[Bank of Ethiopia]] opened its first branch in the city&lt;ref name=NAI-web/&gt; and, a generation later, the writer C.F. Rey described the city as the most "advanced" urban center in the area, with good roads, electric lights, and piped water.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Pankhurst (1968), p.&amp;nbsp;620.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1936-1941 ===
[[File:Dire Dawa Station Blackshirts 1936.jpg|thumb|Italian troops taking possession of the Dire Dawa railway station in 1936]]

On 9 May 1936 Dire Dawa was occupied by Italian troops coming from Harar, after Somali troops from Djibouti had prevented looting during the period of interregnum. [[Pietro Badoglio|Badoglio]] and [[Rodolfo Graziani|Graziani]] celebrated their meeting on the railway station of Dire Dawa. The Italians constructed several new buildings in Dire Dawa, especially for the administration and the Fascist party. They also improved the roads and enlarged the airport so that their military planes could take off from there to bomb the patriot forces in the Gara Mulleta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brotto|first=Enrico|date=1938|title=Dire Daua|url=|journal=Rivista delle Colonie|volume=12|pages=37-44|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for other towns, the Italians conceived a "piano regolatore" for the construction of an Italian town in Dire Dawa. However, their occupation ended before they could complete these plans.

During the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian invasion]], [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] ordered that Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa be spared air attacks (which included the use of [[chemical weapons]] such as [[mustard gas]]) and other destruction as a response to the demands of the United States and certain European countries for the safety of their citizens. The Italian army entered the country from the colonies of [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]] in the north and [[Italian Somaliland|Somalia]] in the southeast. Following all major engagements of the war, Dire Dawa was the location of the meeting of the two Italian forces. General [[Graziani]]'s units, advancing from Harar, reached the city's barbed-wire fence on 6 May 1936, the day after the occupation of Addis Ababa and Emperor [[Haile Selassie]]'s flight along the railroad to [[Djibouti]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. They were met by two French armed cars: the railway remained under French administration and they had remained to protect the French interests. The next day, the first train under Italian control left Addis Ababa: it brought Italy's 46th Infantry Regiment and finally closed the pincers of the two Italian invasion forces. The occupation of the town was more or less a formality,&lt;ref name=NAI-web&gt;Nordic Africa Institute. "[http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/d/ORTDIL.pdf Local History in Ethiopia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528061210/http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/d/ORTDIL.pdf |date=2008-05-28 }}". Accessed 1&amp;nbsp;Mar 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; although resistance fighters known as ''Arbegnoch'' ("Patriots") continued to operate throughout the conflict. It was officially known by its Italian spelling ''Dire Daua'' during the occupation.

=== 1941-1974 ===
In June 1940 the British started to bomb the town and on 29 March 1941 Dire Dawa was liberated by the Allied forces from Harar. The town remained under British Military Administration, being the headquarters for the British Reserved Areas (Ogaden), till it was handed over to the Ethiopian government in 1947. In the following decades the town greatly expanded and the population grew to 160,000. The infrastructure was ameliorated and several industrial plants were established.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Following the restoration of the empire in 1941, Dire Dawa was among the early provincial towns to have its own [[soccer]] league. Around 1947, their team{{mdash}}the Taffari{{mdash}}participated in the [[Ethiopian Football Federation|Ethiopian Championship series]]. That same year, the [[Railroad Workers Syndicate of Dire Dawa]], a [[Trade unions in Ethiopia|labor union]], was formed for welfare purposes.&lt;ref name=NAI-web/&gt; Although its leadership coöperated with the government, its attempt to strike in 1949 was brutally suppressed by imperial troops; at the time, all strikes were seen as forms of insurrection or treason.&lt;ref&gt;Keller, Edmund J. ''Revolutionary&amp;nbsp;Ethiopia'', p.&amp;nbsp;147. Indiana University Press ([[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, a public address system was installed in the central square to receive and rebroadcast state radio transmissions.&lt;ref name=NAI-web/&gt;

=== 1974-1991 ===
The [[Ethiopian Civil War|Ethiopian revolution]] affected the city in many ways. Starting March 1974, there was some worker unrest; six people were wounded when police opened fire on demonstrating railwaymen and students on 17 April. Many Europeans, Yemeni Arabs, and Indians left Dire Dawa; the Greek and Armenian churches were eventually closed due to dwindling membership. On 3 February 1975, the [[Derg]] announced that the Cotton Company of Ethiopia was among 14 textile enterprises to be fully [[nationalization|nationalized]]. The [[portland cement|cement]] factory was also later nationalized. In August 1976, the entire leadership of the local branch of the [[Ethiopian Teachers' Association|teachers' union]] was sacked for alleged anti-revolutionary activities. Ten new officials were appointed pending fresh elections.&lt;ref name=NAI-web/&gt;

Dire Dawa again played a role in the Ethio-Somali War of 1977/78. It was besieged by the Somali troops till November 1977, when the Ethiopians, Cubans and Russians under General Vasiliy Petrov took the offensive and pushed the Somalis back. In May 1979, 250 Oromos who were detained in the prisons of Dire Dawa were executed by the [[Derg]] regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Wagner |first=Ewald |author-link= |editor-last=Uhlig |editor-first=Siegbert |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encylopaedia Aethiopica |title=History of Dire Dawa |access-date=23 July 2018 |year=2005 |publisher=Harrassowitz |series= |volume=2 |location=Wiesbaden}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gebru Tareke, the success of the [[Ethiopian Army]] in holding Dire Dawa (17–18 August 1977) against the [[Somali Army]] was decisive in winning the [[Ogaden War]].&lt;ref&gt;Tareke, Gebru.

Accessed 13 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The war led to [[Somali diaspora|widespread dislocation]] of Ethiopia's native Somali population and subsequent repopulation from other areas of the country greatly decreased their importance around Dire Dawa.

=== 1991-Present ===
Dire Dawa was occupied by the [[EPRDF]] on 31 May 1991. There were reports of about 100 people killed resisting the EPRDF. In 1991, when the [[Somali National Movement]] took control of northern Somalia, they dismantled and sold the only publicly owned industry in the whole Somali northern region, a cement factory near Berbera, which was shipped off to help expand the cement factory in Dire Dawa.&lt;ref name=NAI-web/&gt; Both the [[Issa and Gurgura Liberation Front]] and the [[Oromo Liberation Front]] claimed the city. As a result, there were numerous clashes between the two groups from 1991 until 1993. When the [[Somali Region|Somali Regional State]] was being established in 1993, it wanted Dire Dawa to be its capital. This was opposed by the [[Oromia Region]], so the federal government placed the city under its own jurisdiction to avoid territorial conflict between the two regions.&lt;ref name=Kefale2014&gt;{{cite journal |author=Asnake Kefale &lt;!-- Kefale is his patronym, not his last name. --&gt; |date=2014 |title=Ethnic decentralization and the challenges of inclusive governance in multiethnic cities: The case of Dire Dawa, Ethiopia |journal=Regional &amp; Federal Studies |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=589–605 |doi=10.1080/13597566.2014.971772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 June 2002, a small explosive was detonated at the headquarters of the Ethiopian Railway Commission in Dire Dawa. The Oromo Liberation Front afterwards claimed responsibility for this attack in retaliation "for the continuing harassment of Oromo students, merchants, and farmers by the Ethiopian government." Although blamed for other isolated incidents, this was the latest bombing inside Ethiopia for which the OLF claimed responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tkb.org/Incident.jsp?incID=10529 MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base "Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) attacked Government target (June 24, 2002, Ethiopia)"], last accessed 22 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dire Dawa moved out of federal administration to become a chartered city in 2004 after the federal parliament approved the city charter in proclamation 416/2004.&lt;ref name=Kefale2014/&gt;

The city was flooded in August 2006 when both the ''Dechatu River'' and the ''Gorro River'' overflowed their banks. About 200 people were reported dead, thousands were displaced and there was extensive damage to homes and markets especially along the Dechatu River. Floods are fairly common during the June–September [[wet season|rainy season]]; over 200 people in the region had been killed by flooding in 2005 that did millions of dollars in damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5250386.stm Scores killed in Ethiopia floods], [[BBC News]], 6 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

An overturned truck, heading from [[Dengego]] to Dire Dawa, killed 41 people 4 March 2009. The truck was carrying an unknown number of day laborers when the accident happened, and 38 were immediately killed and as many as 50 were injured. Dead and injured were taken to Dil-chora Hospital in Dire Dawa. The cause was not immediately known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ena.gov.et/EnglishNews/2009/Mar/05Mar09/82179.htm "Death toll for recent road accident reaches 41: Police"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [[Ethiopian News Agency]] website, dated 5 March 2009 (accessed 14 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there are plans to revitalize the city. A historic and popular part of the city is to be demolished and replaced by a financial center, malls, mixed-use buildings, hotels, recreational facilities, and hospitals. As part of the plan, historical buildings will be renovated, and a new space will be allotted for building new homes and businesses for those displaced by the move. New roads, parks, and an industrial zone will also be built, and major railway project is expected to greatly increase business activity in the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://addisababaonline.com/dire-is-booming-but-landmark-get-the-axe/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ena.gov.et/en/index.php/economy/item/804-industrial-park-to-be-constructed-in-adama-dire-dawa-cities&lt;/ref&gt;

Censuses record that Oromo are the greatest percentage of the city, based on the number who claim Oromo identity and speak the Oromo language. Traditionally the Nole Oromo clan used the area as grazing land, and farming in the Laga Harre district. They live alongside the [[Gurgura]] clan which share both Oromo and Somali identities, speaking the Oromo language and tracing their genealogy to the [[Dir (clan)|Dir]], a Somali clan family.&lt;ref name=Kefale2014/&gt; The [[Issa (clan)|Issa]] subclan of the [[Dir (clan)|Dir]] make up a huge number of urban and rural Dire Dawa, whereas a small  fraction of the [[Gadabuursi]] subclan of the [[Dir (clan)|Dir]] mainly reside in the rural areas to the east of the chartered city state &lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=P5AZyEhMtbkC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=dire+dawa+gadabursi&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimk87Aq7fQAhXCVxoKHc8NBPcQ6AEIRTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=dire%20dawa%20gadabursi&amp;f=false|title=Saints and Somalis: Popular Islam in a Clan-based Society|last=Lewis|first=I.

About 2007, a [[concrete sleeper]] factory was established, sited near the cement factory.

Dire Dawa is home to several market centers, the biggest being Taiwan along with Qefira which is on the flood plain. Near Dire Dawa and what is now Kebele 01, trading happened in the town called Melka Jebdu. It has been the gateway for most of the goods sold in places such as Taiwan.

==Transportation==

Dire Dawa is served by a station on the [[Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway]], which is located 10 km northwest of the city centre close to the town of Melka Jebdu. In addition, the city is served by the [[Ethio-Djibouti Railways]] with its western terminus located in the city centre. The [[Dire Dawa Airport]] offers flights to and from the city. Additionally, the [[Selam Bus Line Share Company]] provides inter-city bus service.

The '''Estonian mark''' ([[Estonian language|Estonian]]: ''Eesti mark'') was the [[currency]] of [[Estonia]] between 1918 and 1927. It was initially equivalent to the [[German ostmark]], which had been circulating alongside the [[Russian ruble]] since the [[German occupation of Estonia during World War I|German occupation]]. It was divided into 100 ''penns'' (in Nominative case: ''penn''). It was replaced in 1928 by the [[Estonian kroon]] at a rate of 1 kroon = 100 marka.

Until 1919 there were also Russian rubles, [[German ostruble]]s and [[Finnish mark]]s in circulation.

==Coins==

Coins were issued in denominations of 1, 3, 5 and 10 marka between 1922 and 1926. The 1922 issues were struck in [[cupro-nickel]] whilst the later issues were in nickel-bronze.

==Banknotes==

In 1919, treasury notes ("kassatäht") were issued in denominations of 5, 10, 20 and 50 penni, 1, 3, 5, 10, 25 and 100 marka along with 50 marka banknotes ("pangatäht"). Later, treasury notes were issued in denominations up to 1000 marka, along with banknotes up to 5000 marka. Exchange notes ("vahetustäht") were also issued, in 1922, in denominations of 10 and 25 marka.

The '''European Union withholding tax''' is the common name for a [[withholding tax]] which is deducted from interest earned by [[European Union]] residents on their investments made in another member state, by the state in which the investment is held. The [[European Union]] itself has no taxation powers, so the name is strictly a misnomer. The aim of the tax is to ensure that citizens of one member state do not [[tax evasion|evade taxation]] by depositing funds outside the jurisdiction of residence and so distort the single market. The tax is withheld at source and passed on to the EU Country of residence.  [[#Countries providing for tax withholding under the Transitory Provisions|All but three member states]] disclose the recipient of the interest concerned. Most EU states already apply a withholding tax to savings and investment income earned by their nationals on deposits and investments in their own states. The Directive seeks to bring inter-state income into the same arrangement, under the [[Single Market]] policy.

== Creation ==
The tax was introduced at the time of the introduction of the [[European Union Savings Directive]] (EUSD), a [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] on the taxation of interest income from savings within the European Union that came into effect on 1 July 2005.

== Objective of the EU Savings Directive ==
The original aim of the EUSD was that all countries would freely disclose interest earned by a resident of an EU country in order to ensure that the interest was fully declared in his country of residence. The plan was that non-EU countries would also agree to disclose information about the interest earned by EU residents. Many non-EU states and countries agreed to introduce similar measures. These countries included most tax havens and dependent territories of the EU countries. Countries such as the Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey, Cayman Islands, Andorra, Turks &amp; Caicos, British Virgin Islands, Monaco, Switzerland, and many others thus agreed to implement similar or transitional arrangements (see below). The transitional arrangements involved the payment of a [[withholding tax]] whilst bank secrecy remained protected.

== Maintenance of bank secrecy laws and the EU withholding tax ==
Some countries agreed to fully comply with the EU Savings Directive by disclosing the names of their account holders and the interest that they earned. However, several other EU and non-EU countries, such as Switzerland, objected to the disclosure of account holders' names on the grounds that such a disclosure would be contrary to their bank secrecy laws. [[Bank secrecy]] laws prevent the disclosure of information about account holders, their assets, and their interest or other income.

Finally an agreement was struck with the objecting countries. The objecting countries achieved agreement from the [[European Commission|EC]] that no further attempt would be made to commence negotiations regarding bank secrecy rules for at least 7 years, in return for which individual account holders could, if they so wished, voluntarily elect to waive bank secrecy and authorise disclosure. Those individuals who did not make any election would see a withholding tax deducted from their bank and bond interest. To avoid the withholding tax, certain types of individuals could also prove that they were exempt from taxation in their country of residence. Exempt individuals include certain diplomats and others with a special tax status in their country of residence.

Accordingly, in order to guarantee privacy and bank secrecy for EU residents who have accounts within certain territories such as Switzerland, a withholding tax of 35% is being levied on the interest earned by those EU residents. This withholding tax, which applies only to certain interest income NOT considered as sourced in Switzerland, such as interest earned on fiduciary reposits, is passed on ''anonymously'' to the EU countries concerned, and is known informally as the '''EU Withholding Tax'''.

== Example with interest on a fiduciary deposit ==

In the example below we use Greece as an example, but the same mechanism applies to any Member State.

If a Greek individual receives e.g. EUR 500 of interest income from a fiduciary deposit in a Swiss bank, the individual would have 2 possibilities:

(1) to accept the levying of the 35% "retention" tax under the EU-CH agreement (as discussed above), or

(2) to expressly authorise the Swiss bank to report that he has received the interest payments to the Swiss authorities that are then obliged to pass on automatically the information to the Greek competent authority (Art. 2 of the EU-CH agreement).

If the beneficial owner decides to be subject to the 35% "retention" tax under the EU-CH agreement, upon filing the Greek tax return, that tax is fully creditable, with possible subsequent reimbursement by Greece under Article 9(1) of the EU-CH agreement: "Where this amount exceeds the amount of tax due on the total amount of interest subject to retention in accordance with its national law, the Member State of residence for tax purposes shall repay the excess amount of tax withheld to the beneficial owner.". In the example, the "retention" tax under the EU-CH agreement is 500*0.35=175. 75% of that EUR 175 (175*0.75=131.25) would be transferred ''anonymously'' to Greece. Upon filing his tax return, the Greek beneficial owner is entitled to full credit, not only for the amount paid to Greece (EUR 131.25), but for the total "retention" tax levied under the EU-CH agreement (EUR 175). Therefore, if the Greek tax liability would be 500*0.10=50 and the credit would be EUR 175, the credit would cover 100% of the Greek tax liability and would exceed it by 50-175=-125. That excess credit (EUR 125) must be refunded to the beneficial owner by Greece.

If the beneficial owner chooses option (2) and authorises the Swiss bank to report the information, he will be only taxed in Greece according to the Greek domestic rate of 10% and the Greek competent authority will have the possibility to check that he has correctly declared the interest payments received from the Swiss bank.

== Example with interest on an ordinary bank account (i.e. NOT a fiduciary deposit) ==

In the example below we use Greece as an example, but the same mechanism applies to any Member State.

If a Greek beneficial owner has an ordinary bank account (i.e. not a fiduciary deposit) that produced interest income of e.g. EUR 500, he will be subject to 35% anticipatory tax in Switzerland under its domestic law (i.e. NOT under the EU-CH Agreement), i.e. 500*0.35=175.

Then, if the beneficial owner would like to use the reduced rate under GR-CH double tax treaty (10%), he would have to file a refund claim to the Swiss tax authorities. That claim would have to be accompanied by a certificate of tax residence issued by the Greek tax authorities. When requesting this certificate, the beneficial owner is effectively signalling to the Greek tax authorities the fact that he has earned or will earn income from a foreign source. Once he has filed the refund claim to the Swiss authorities, the Greek beneficial owner will be entitled to a refund for the difference between the anticipatory tax (500*0.35=175) and the maximum tax under the double tax treaty (500*0.10=50), which is 175-50=125. So, the actual tax burden in Switzerland after the application of the refund procedure is EUR 50. Now if the Greek domestic tax on the inbound interest income is 10%, it would in principle be levied on a gross basis, i.e. the tax base would be the full amount of interest income received (EUR 500). The Greek tax liability would be 500*0.10=50. However, under Art. 22 of the GR-CH Double tax treaty "Where a resident of Greece derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention may be taxed in Switzerland, Greece shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the income of that resident an amount equal to the income tax paid in Switzerland. Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the Greek tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable to the income which may be taxed in Switzerland." The Greek beneficial owner would therefore be entitled to credit the EUR 50 levied in Switzerland against his tax liability in Greece, which is also EUR 50. Therefore, after the application of the credit, the Greek beneficial owner would not owe any Greek tax on that interest income.

== Income on which the EU tax is deducted ==
The EU withholding tax applies only to bank interest, bond interest, and analogous income, such as income from bond funds, [[money market fund]]s, loans, and mortgages.

== Anti-avoidance ==
Certain anti-avoidance measures exist, for example, to levy the tax where interest has been converted to some form of capital gain. Typically this would apply where, for example, a zero coupon bond has been bought and sold at a profit, or where a bond fund, or a money-market fund, does not pay out its interest and the fund is subsequently sold at a profit. The rules define how much of the fund's assets must be in bonds for it to be classified as "interest earning".

Initial reports as to the amounts of funds raised by the withholding tax suggest that the anti-avoidance measures have not been particularly effective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/ae51ab84-0d9f-11db-a385-0000779e2340,_i_nbePage=d89d6328-51da-11da-9ca0-0000779e2340.html FT.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Income gains and profits which are not taxed ==
The EU withholding tax is not levied on any other forms of income such as employment income, trading profits, commercial activities, royalties, annuities and similar income. Also, the EU withholding tax does not apply to dividends from shares, nor to capital gains and other profits realised on investments. All these types of income and profits are described as being "out of scope".

== Individuals and accounts which are not affected ==
The EU withholding tax is levied only on individuals and not on [[company|companies]], [[discretionary trust]]s, [[foundation (charity)|foundation]]s, [[stiftung]]s, [[anstalt]]s, [[investment fund]]s, etc., except in very special circumstances, e.g. a "[[bare trust]]".

The EU withholding tax is not deducted from individuals who reside outside the European Union.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  Thus, for example, a resident of [[Jersey]] or of Switzerland, would not pay the tax, even though these countries have signed the agreement with the EU. Neither Jersey nor Switzerland are in the [[European Union]].

== Companies ==
The EU withholding tax does not apply to interest paid to companies.  A separate EU directive, the Interest and Royalties Directive, applies to interest (or royalties) paid by a company in one member state to an associated company in another member state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0049:en:HTML European Union Interest and Royalties Directive]&lt;/ref&gt;  Such interest is exempt from withholding tax, although in many cases interest paid is in any event exempt from  withholding tax under the terms of [[tax treaty|double tax treaties]] between member states.

== UK resident but not UK domiciled individuals ==
In the UK such individuals have a special tax status which limits them to paying tax on income and gains from UK sources, and on foreign income and gains which are remitted to the UK.  A similar status can be accorded to individuals in some other European countries (e.g. Belgium and the Netherlands), because they are only temporarily resident for the purpose of employment. Certain countries such as Jersey and Switzerland accept that these individuals may be exempt from tax on income earned and retained overseas, and are thus not subject to any retention. The exemption needs to be proven.

==Beckham Law==
Spain has introduced a similar concept to the UK non-domiciled rule above, known as the [[Beckham law]].  The law gained its nickname after the footballer [[David Beckham]] became one of the first foreigners to take advantage of it.  However the law is aimed at all foreign workers (particularly the wealthier ones) living in Spain.  Upon application and acceptance such individuals are only liable for Spanish taxes on their Spanish source income and assets.  As with the UK non-domiciled individuals, exemption from tax on foreign income must be proven to the financial institution to avoid the EU Savings Tax deduction.

== The transitory provisions of the Withholding Tax ==
The Countries that would be applying the transitory provisions, instead of exchanging information will retain withholding tax as follows:

:*15% in the first three years (2005-07-01 – 2008-06-30),
:*20% in the next three years (2008-07-01 – 2011-06-30), and
:*35% after 2011-07-01.

With regard to the distribution of their withholding tax, the Directive provides that all Countries that are withholding it will retain 25% of all receipts at their end and will transfer the remaining 75% to the Member State where the beneficiary owner is resident.

With regard to double taxation, the Directive provides that the Member State where the beneficiary owner is resident, and therefore where he normally pays his tax dues, should ensure that tax is not paid more than once when applying the withholding tax rates.

== Countries providing for the exchange of information ==
{{As of|2018}}, all EU member states exchange information with each other, per EU Council directive 2014/107/EU.

Prior to 2017, there were several exceptions for member countries. The most recent exception was Austria. Belgium decided to discontinue applying the transitional withholding tax in 2010 and exchange information afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/personal_tax/savings_tax/rules_applicable/index_en.htm European Commission Taxation and Customs Union – Rules applicable]&lt;/ref&gt; In Luxembourg, clients could choose between exchange of information and withholding tax retention until 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawlegal.eu/withholding-tax/ European Withholding Tax system, including Luxembourg new Bill]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gibraltar]] is deemed to be part of the UK for the purposes of the EU Savings Directive and thus will exchange information with other EU countries such as Spain and the UK. Residents of  [[Gibraltar]] will either suffer withholding tax on interest arising overseas, or have that income reported to the UK who will pass it on to Gibraltar authorities.

Among the third countries signatories there are also, [[Anguilla]], '''[[Cayman Islands]]''',  [[Montserrat]] and [[Aruba]] who have agreed to exchanging information.

== Countries providing for tax withholding under the Transitory Provisions ==
Countries that are not EU member states that also maintain bank secrecy:{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

*Andorra
*[[British Virgin Islands]]
*[[Channel Islands]]
*Lebanon
*Liechtenstein
*Monaco
*[[Netherlands Antilles]]
*San Marino
*Switzerland, although on 25 Sep 2009, Switzerland was added to the OECD list of countries having substantially implemented the internationally agreed tax standards
*[[Turks and Caicos Islands]]

==Countries and territories of E.U. members who did not sign any agreement==
[[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Bermuda]] and [[Barbados]] did not sign any agreement.

Bermuda, a UK dependent territory was missed out by EU by accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lowtax.net/specials/std.html |title=EU Savings Tax Directive Report |quote=So the deed is done, and the EU Savings Tax Directive will come into force in all member states, and all those offshore jurisdictions beholden in one way or another to the member states, on 1st July, 2005.

'''Presidential elections''' were held in [[the Gambia]] on 24 November 2011. Incumbent President [[Yahya Jammeh]], in office since seizing power in a [[1994 Gambian coup d'état|1994 coup]], faced [[Ousainou Darboe]] of the [[United Democratic Party (Gambia)|United Democratic Party]] and [[Hamat Bah]] of the [[National Alliance for Democracy and Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15851706 | publisher=BBC News | title=Gambia: Ecowas observers boycott 'unfair poll' | date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral system==
Voting took place using marbles dropped into coloured containers each containing a gong.&lt;ref name="aljazeera"/&gt;

==Conduct==
The elections were monitored by the [[African Union]] who praised the process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/African-Union-Observers-Impressed-With-Gambia-Election--134467893.html |title=African Union Observers Impressed With Gambia Election |work=VOA |year=2011 |accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[European Union]], [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name="aljazeera"/&gt; The [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) did not send any monitors because of "an unacceptable level of control of the electronic media by the party in power... and an opposition and electorate cowed by repression and intimidation".&lt;ref name="aljazeera"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/11/2011112574417929393.html |title=Gambia's Jammeh wins disputed elections |publisher=Al Jazeera |year=2011 |accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the elections Jammeh had claimed "I will never compromise peace and stability at the altar of so-called democracy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2011/11/gambians-vote-in-election-condemned-by-regional-body-ecowas.html |title=Gambians vote in election condemned as unfair |work=Los Angeles Times |quote='I will never compromise peace and stability at the altar of so-called democracy,' |accessdate=26 November 2011 |date=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "there is no way I can lose unless you tell me that all Gambian people are mad" and in response to press criticism said "The journalists are less than 1% of the population and if anybody expects me to allow less than 1% of the population to destroy 99% of the population, you are in the wrong place."&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

There was also criticism of the election organisation as many voters went to the wrong polling station.&lt;ref name="aljazeera"/&gt;

26 August 2007 - In [[Kongolo, Katanga|Kongolo]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], 14 of 15 aboard died when an overloaded  [[Antonov An-32|Antonov An-32B]] ([[NATO reporting name]] "Curl", registration ''9Q-CAC'') owned by [[Agefreco Air]] and operated by the Great Lakes Business Company [[2007 Kongolo Antonov An-32B crash|crashed]] short of the runway while attempting to return to the airport after experiencing engine problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1462">'''Gårdlösa''' is the site of an [[Iron Age]] settlement in the parish of [[Smedstorp]] in [[Skåne]], [[Sweden]]. It was inhabited shortly during the late [[Nordic Bronze Age]], and from the 1st century BC–11th century AD.

In 1949, a woman's grave from the [[Roman Iron Age]] was found in Gårdlösa. It had a silver [[Brooch|fibula]] on which there was a [[Elder Futhark|runic inscription]]. In 1963–1976, there were archaeological excavations of house foundations, grave fields and a shrine. The rich and varied material has enabled scholars to perform cross-domain studies of the inhabitants' social, economic and religious life, giving a good picture of an Iron Age agricultural settlement and its resources.

There are two [[stone circle (Iron Age)|stone circles]], and two irregularly shaped cobble-clad graves and a smaller one, as well as a circular formation of stones from the late [[Vendel Age]] or the [[Viking Age]].

The '''kakaki''' is a three to four metre long metal [[trumpet]] used in [[Hausa people|Hausa]] traditional ceremonial music. ''Kakaki'' is the name used in [[Chad]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Ghana]], [[Benin]] [[Niger]], and [[Nigeria]]. The instrument is also known as ''waza'' in Chad and [[Sudan]], and ''malakat'' in [[Ethiopia]].

An ancient instrument, the kakaki was predominant among [[Songhai people|Songhai]] [[cavalry]]. Its sound is associated with royalty and it is only played at events at the palace of the king or sultan in Hausa societies. It is used as part of the ''sara'', a weekly statement of power and authority. Kakaki are exclusively played by men.

'''Malkh''' is a festival dedicated to the [[Deela-Malkh]] in [[Vainakh mythology]]. 25 December was the birthday and the festival of the Sun. During the ceremonies suppliants turned to the east. Also in Nakh architecture temples and house façades were directed to east. Nakh people believed that Sun went to visit her mother Aza at the summer and winter solstices. The journey took her six months to complete. Nakh people used the [[fylfot]] as symbol of Deela-Malkh on their buildings and tomb-stones.&lt;ref name="chechhand"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaimoukha|first=Amjad M.|title=The Chechens: a handbook|publisher=Routledge|date=2005-03-01|edition=1st|pages=110|isbn=978-0-415-32328-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PnjAlei9fe0C&amp;pg=PA110 |accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miloud'''(ميلود in Arabic) is a masculine [[Given name]] which refers to the birth of [[the Prophet of Islam]] Muhamed '''El Mawlid Ennabawi ''' (and deriving from the latter). In the Middle-East, the name is '''Miled''', with the same root.

This name is  mainly used in [[Maghreb]] and in [[Europe]] by families from North Africa living in Europe, notably in France.

It is a custom to give a son the name  '''Miloud''' or '''Miled''' if he happens to be born on the day of the Prophet's Birth.

== Variants ==

A female variant of this name, ''Milouda'', has appeared, mostly in [[Maghreb]] and [[Europe]]:  it is merely the feminine derivation of '''Miloud''' and has the same meaning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2805">The '''National Expert Commission of Ukraine on the Protection of Public Morality''' ({{lang-uk|Національна експертна комісія України з питань захисту суспільної моралі}}) was a state body that from late 2004 till early 2015 operated  to evaluate media to check they observed Ukrainian morality laws, which ban inciting religious hatred, producing or disseminating pornography, and propagating alcoholism and smoking.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.tyzhden.ua/post/133662&lt;/ref&gt; The commission was disbanded by the [[Ukrainian parliament]] on 10 February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiosvoboda.mobi/a/26839747.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On 17 November 2004 the commission was established by then Prime Minister [[Viktor Yanukovych]].&lt;ref&gt;http://zakon4.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/1550-2004-п&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010 then-President Yanukovych issued a decree to eliminate the commission.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.tyzhden.ua/post/71154&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, the body gained media attention in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2189857/Ukraine-wants-ban-cartoon-Spongebob-Squarepants--promotes-homosexuality.html&lt;/ref&gt; for reviewing allegations that popular children's properties, such as ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Disney films]], ''[[Shrek]]'', and ''[[Teletubbies]]'' are inappropriate for children and need to be banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marson|first=James|title=Ukraine's Morality Police Probe 'Gay' SpongeBob|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2012/08/15/gay-spongebob-offends-ukraine-morality-commission/|accessdate=February 2, 2014|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission was eliminated by the [[Ukrainian parliament]] on 10 February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiosvoboda.mobi/a/26839747.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The (law that created the) body was criticised by the [[Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group]] for being dangerously open to subjective interpretation what precisely “harms public morality”.&lt;ref&gt;http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1423052539&lt;/ref&gt; But it noted that the commission was never used to limit [[freedom of speech in Ukraine|freedom of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1423052539&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OpenELEC''' (short for '''Open Embedded Linux Entertainment Center''') is a [[Linux distribution]] designed for [[home theater PC]]s and based on the [[Kodi (software)|Kodi]] (formerly XBMC) media player.

OpenELEC is an extremely small and very fast-booting [[Linux|Linux based]] distribution, primarily designed to boot from [[flash memory|flash]] [[memory card]] such as [[CompactFlash]] or a [[solid-state drive]], similar to that of the [[XBMCbuntu]] (formerly [[XBMC Live]]) distribution but specifically targeted to a minimum [[set-top box]] hardware setup based on an ARM SoCs or Intel x86 processor and graphics.&lt;ref name="Lifehacker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="XBMC-Focused OpenELEC 1.0 Released"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OpenELEC 1.0 released 26 October 2011 natethomas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OpenELEC.tv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OpenELEC Media Center Software on Launchpad"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Thursday, 20 October 2011 04:18 |url=http://openelec.tv/news/item/207-openelec-1-released |title=OpenELEC 1.0 Released |publisher=Openelec.tv |date=20 October 2011 |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110172657/http://www.openelec.tv/news/item/207-openelec-1-released |archivedate=10 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Since 2011, the OpenELEC team usually releases a new major version, following the Kodi release schedule.

Since 2014, specifics builds supporting a set of Graphics/GPU chipsets (ION, Fusion, Intel,...) are deprecated. And since version 6, [[x86]] builds are deprecated too. Builds are currently available for [[x86-64]] systems (as "Generic Build"), [[Raspberry Pi]], [[Raspberry Pi 2]], Raspberry Pi 3 and the first generation [[Apple TV]].

{{cquote|If you think your investment in the Pi and openELEC is worth the difference in price toward a fully featured smart TV or a home media center, then you should definitely spend more time tweaking and taming this little box. As far as XBMC goes, it surely shows a lot of potential, and I'm rather pleased with openELEC. Surprised and delighted. Except the setup, which is bollocks.}}
Nathan Willis from [[LWN.net]] wrote review of OpenELEC 5:&lt;ref&gt;[https://lwn.net/Articles/641220/ A look at OpenELEC 5 &amp;#91;LWN.net&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|OpenELEC has done a good job of making setup and configuration painless, which is certainly critical. But its primary competition these days is the array of cheap, streaming-only set-top boxes from Roku, Amazon, and the like, all of which deliver on ease-of-use and on ease-of-finding content. For an open-source project like Kodi to compete with the commercial products, it will probably have to simplify the process of finding and setting up add-ons. OpenELEC 5 brings Kodi closer than ever to being a plug-and-play product, but it is not quite foolproof yet.}}
One of [[DistroWatch]] Weekly editors, Jesse Smith, wrote in review of OpenELEC 5.0.8:&lt;ref&gt;[https://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20150831#openelec DistroWatch Weekly, Issue 625, 31 August 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Simply put, OpenELEC makes for a very good appliance-style operating system. It turns the host computer into an easy to use multimedia centre, the interface is easy to navigate and yet the distribution remains fairly flexible in both its appearance and function. If you're looking for an inexpensive media centre that is easier than the typical Linux distribution set up, then OpenELEC is definitely an option I would recommend trying.}}

The '''Social Democratic Party''' ({{lang-ca|Partit Socialdemòcrata}}, PS) is a [[social-democratic]]&lt;ref name="Nordsieck"/&gt; [[list of political parties in Andorra|political party]] in [[Andorra]].

==History==
The party was established in the run-up to the [[Andorran parliamentary election, 2001|March 2001 parliamentary elections]] when the [[National Democratic Group]] split in two, with the [[Democratic Party (Andorra)|Democratic Party]] also being formed.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen D]] &amp; Stöver P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p162 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new party received 28.7% of the vote and won six seats.&lt;ref name="Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p164"&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p164&lt;/ref&gt;

In the buildup to the [[Andorran parliamentary election, 2005|April 2005 parliamentary elections]] the party formed an alliance named '''L'Alternativa''' with the [[Parochial Union of Independents Group]] (GUPI) and [[Democratic Renewal (Andorra)|Democratic Renewal]] to contest parish-level seats.&lt;ref name="Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p164"/&gt; The party won six seats at the national level, whilst the alliance won six seats at the parish level. With a total of twelve seats, the party remained in opposition.

The [[Andorran parliamentary election, 2009|April 2009 parliamentary elections]] saw the party renew its alliance with GUPI and some independents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2005_09.htm Elections in 2009] IPU&lt;/ref&gt; The alliance won 14 of the 28 seats and PS leader [[Jaume Bartumeu]] became Prime Minister, with the [[Andorra for Change]] party supporting the government.&lt;ref name=IPU2/&gt;

In 2010 the APC withdrew its support for the PS-led government, and in 2011 the [[General Council (Andorra)|General Council]] rejected the government's budget, forcing early elections.&lt;ref name=IPU2&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2005_E.htm Latest elections] IPU&lt;/ref&gt; The  [[Andorran parliamentary election, 2011|April 2011 parliamentary elections]] saw the PS receive 34.8% of the vote, reducing its representation to six seats.&lt;ref name=IPU2/&gt;

In the [[Andorran parliamentary election, 2015|March 2015 parliamentary elections]], the party ran in alliance with the [[Greens of Andorra]], [[Citizens' Initiative (Andorra)|Citizens' Initiative]] and independent candidates. The alliance's vote share fell to 24%, winning only three seats.

'''Talnet''' is a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[Gifted education|educational project]] that focuses on the development of gifted and motivated children. The mentioned project was established under aegis of [[Charles University in Prague|Charles University Prague]] and aims to educate extraordinary gifted children in natural sciences. The theory is that talented children need individual treatment to identify themselves and develop their gifts. A program that would deal these goals was needed. That's why the program Talnet creates a space in the online platform, where its students could meet, discuss the topics they've found interesting ones. In addition, such possibility is there not only with the other Talnet students - with the experts as well. TalnetSpace – online platform of Talnet communication – lets connect students and pupils according to their goals and interests.

Talnet develops also network among partners abroad and seeks the other groups in the world which aims are similar to the Talnet's one - the education of extraordinary gifted students. The main effort is given to the students' meeting across boardings. Thus the meeting has two stages: at first students explore online activities and learn the communication, secondly they meet each other at interesting places of the connected countries.

Talnet aims also pupils', parents and teachers' education. This way, Talnet helps them to find out the gift among all the pupils in the class and support them sufficiently. The organisation uses international knowledge and continues in well-known contests and activities special prepared for students with natural science interests. Talnet cooperates with a group of psychologists, who at the beginning and during the pupils' online study watch the gifted young persons in their developing and consulate their personal problems with them.

== What Talnet offers ==

    &lt;blockquote&gt;"Talnet offers the whole structure of educational and exploring activities to children who are recommended by their teachers or psychologists. Activities differ in topic, forms (face to face, blended, online) teaching approach, work load, complexity and applicability. We prefer active participation of children and youth in rich learning environment according to the results of psycho-diagnostics tests.

Since the beginning of the project we have confirmed that many gifted children need more and more challenging, e.g. demanding and complex, activities. The level of challenge may be perceived in many different aspects such as subject, problem solving, creativity, production and social aspects etc. The main purpose of international activities is offering gifted youth further opportunities for development of their competencies and extending the offer of authentic educational and social activities."&lt;ref&gt;[http://talnet.cz/lang/en/about_talnet.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12259">A '''tax exile''' is a person who leaves a country to avoid the payment of [[income tax]] or other taxes. It is a person who already owes money to the tax authorities or wishes to avoid being liable in the future to taxation at what they consider high tax rates, instead choosing to reside in a foreign country or jurisdiction which has no taxes or lower tax rates. In general, there is no [[extradition]] agreement between countries which covers extradition for outstanding tax liabilities. Going into tax exile is a form of [[tax avoidance|tax mitigation or avoidance]]. A tax exile normally cannot return to their home country without being subject to outstanding tax liabilities, which may prevent them from leaving the country until they have been paid.

Most countries tax individuals who are resident in their jurisdiction. Though residency rules vary, most commonly individuals are resident in a country for taxation purposes if they spend at least six months (or some other period) in any one tax year in the country, and/or have an abiding attachment to the country, such as owning a fixed property.

==National rules==
===United Kingdom===
A very simplified 'rule of thumb' is that under [[UK law]] a person is "[[tax residence|tax resident]]" if that person meets any of the residency tests set out under the Statutory Residency Test introduced on 6 April 2014. The reality of the matter is far more complex and unclear.

===United States===
[[File:Form 1040, 2005.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. citizens are required to file U.S. tax returns, even if they do not live in the U.S.]]
Under the [[Internal Revenue Code]], a [[Citizenship of the United States|United States citizen]] is taxed on his or her worldwide income, regardless to their place of residence. United States citizens can avoid tax liability only by both moving abroad and [[Citizenship of the United States#Renunciation of citizenship|renouncing citizenship]], but if they continue to earn money inside the United States, they will still be liable for taxes as if they were [[guest worker program|guest worker]]s{{Citation needed|reason=presumed counterfactual|date=February 2017}}. However, United States citizens living abroad are entitled to substantial tax savings through the [[foreign earned income exclusion]].

A permanent resident in the United States is generally treated as a citizen for tax purposes unless his or her residency lapses. An immigrant not legally admitted for permanent residence (such as a [[guest worker]]) becomes liable for United States taxes if they spend more than 122 days in the tax year in the United States.

Abu Yaqub '''Yusuf Hamdani''' (born 1062 /440 H - died March 1141 /Rajab 535 H) is the first of the group of Central Asian [[Sufi]] teachers known simply as ''[[Khwajagan]]'' (the Masters) of the [[Naqshbandi]] order. His shrine is at [[Merv]] (Turkmenistan).

==Life==
{{Sunni Islam}}
Born in Buzanjird near [[Hamadan]] in 1062, he moved from Hamadan to Baghdad when he was eighteen years of age. He studied the Shafi'i school of fiqh under the supervision of the master of his time, Shaykh Ibrahim ibn Ali ibn Yusuf al-Fairuzabadi. He kept association in Baghdad with the great scholar, Abu Ishaq ash-Shirazi, who gave him greater deference than to any of his other students although he was the youngest. But he adhered to the [[Hanafi school]] unlike his teachers.

According to Ibn Khallikan, he began his religious career with the cultivation of the religious sciences, becoming both a respected scholar of [[hadith]] and [[fiqh]] and a popular preacher in [[Baghdad]]. He was so brilliant a jurisprudent that he became the [[Marja'|Marja]] of his time for all scholars in that field. He was known in Baghdad, the center of Islamic knowledge, in Isfahan, Bukhara, Samarqand, Khwarazm, and throughout Central Asia.

Later he abandoned these pursuits, adopting an intensely ascetic way of life and travelled east, first settling in [[Herat]] and later in [[Merv]], where his tomb is still reputed to exist. He became an ascetic and engaged in constant worship and mujahada (spiritual struggle), instructed by Shaykh Abu 'Ali al-Farmadhi. He associated with Shaykh Abdullah Ghuwayni and Shaykh Hasan Simnani. He named four khalifas or successors, a pattern that repeated itself for several succeeding generations of the Khwajagan, including [[Ahmed Yesevi]] and Khwaja [[Abdul Khaliq Gajadwani]], the next link in the Naqshbandi [[silsila]].
