'''Amy M. Homes''' (pen name '''A. M. Homes'''; born December 18, 1961,&lt;ref&gt;[[Library of Congress]] [[authority control|authority record]]. Retrieved on November 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Washington, D.C.) is an American writer best known for her controversial novels and unusual short stories, which feature extreme situations and characters. Notably, her novel ''[[The End of Alice]]'' (1996) depicts a convicted [[child sexual abuse|child molester]] and murderer.

Homes, who was adopted at birth, met her biological parents for the first time when she was 31, and published a memoir, ''The Mistress's Daughter'' (2007) about her exploration of her expanded "family". {{As of|2018|alt=Her most recent novel|post=,}} ''[[May We Be Forgiven]],'' was published by [[Viking Books]] on September 27, 2012. The first chapter of the novel was published in the 100th issue of ''[[Granta]]'' (in 2008; edited by [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]]), and was selected by [[Salman Rushdie]] for ''[[The Best American Short Stories 2008]]''. The novel won the [[Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction|Women's Prize for Fiction]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="prize" /&gt;

==Early life==
Homes was born in 1961 in Washington, DC to a single woman who got pregnant during an affair with her older, married boss. Homes was put up for adoption immediately after birth and reared by her adoptive parents in the Washington metropolitan area. She did not meet her biological parents until she was 31, when her mother first tracked her down.

Homes received her Bachelor of Arts in 1985 from [[Sarah Lawrence College]],&lt;ref&gt;Weich, Dave, "A. M. Homes Is a Big Fat Liar," Powells.com, May 24, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; where she studied with the author [[Grace Paley]]. She earned her [[Master of Fine Arts]] from the [[Iowa Writers Workshop|University of Iowa Writers' Workshop]].&lt;ref&gt;https://writersworkshop.uiowa.edu/resources/news/am-homes-wins-womens-prize-fiction&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Fiction===
Homes has written both short stories and novels; the former published in leading magazines such as ''Granta,'' ''The New Yorker'', ''[[Timothy McSweeney's Quarterly Concern|McSweeney's]],'' and ''[[BOMB Magazine]]''.

She wrote her first novel, ''[[Jack (A.M. Homes novel)|Jack]]'', when she was 19; it was published in 1989 when she was 28, after she had published some short stories. An exploration of family life and sexuality, it features a boy with divorced parents who learns that his father is gay. The book was critically praised and is still featured in school and college reading lists.&lt;ref name="adams"&gt;[http://www.barcelonareview.com/eng/eng4b4.htm Jill Adams, "An Interview with A.M. Homes"], ''The Barcelona Review'', Jun/July 2007, #58/59, accessed 31 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Homes wrote a screenplay to adapt it as a film by the same name, produced in 2004 for the cable network [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]].

A year later, her first short-story collection, ''[[The Safety of Objects]]'' (1990), was published. This was adapted as an independent [[The Safety of Objects|feature film]] of the same name, released in 2001 and starring [[Glenn Close]] among others. Homes co-wrote the screenplay together with the director, [[Rose Troche]].

Her second novel was ''In a Country of Mothers'' (1993). It centered around a therapist and a girl patient who was adopted; the therapist begins to think the girl might be her own daughter, whom she had given up at birth.&lt;ref name="adams"/&gt; (Homes was writing this novel and it was in production before her own birth mother tracked her down in 1992.)

Homes' 1996 novel, ''[[The End of Alice]],'' is narrated mostly by a convicted [[child sexual abuse|child molester]] and murderer imprisoned in the West Block of [[Sing Sing]]. The [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning author [[Michael Cunningham]] described this work as 
&lt;blockquote&gt;dark and treacherous as ice on a highway. It establishes A. M. Homes as one of the bravest, most terrifying writers working today. She never plays it safe, and it begins to look as if she can do almost anything.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
It aroused considerable controversy and received mixed reviews because of its subject matter and objectionable protagonists; in the UK, bookseller [[W.H. Smith]] refused to carry it.&lt;ref name="krist"/&gt;

Homes published the first chapter of her 1999 novel ''[[Music for Torching]]'' as a short story in ''The New Yorker.'' The novel features characters who appeared in the short stories of her first collection, ''The Safety of Objects.'' It features a suburban couple who deliberately burn their house down. Jill Adams in ''The Barcelona Review'' described it as having Homes' "trademark style of wry humor applied to the uncanny dissection of suburbia’s facade."&lt;ref name="adams"/&gt; Britain's ''[[The Observer]]'' found it "immensely disturbing".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Alex. "Book Burns Night", ''The Observer,'' 22 August 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine called the novel "haunting,",&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, Kim, People, "Music For Torching", June 28, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gary Krist (writer)|Gary Krist]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as a 
&lt;blockquote&gt;nasty and willfully grotesque novel. The fact is, I was at times appalled by the book, annoyed by it, angered by it. Its ending struck me as cynical and manipulative. But even so, I found myself rapt from beginning to end, fascinated by Homes's single-minded talent for provocation."&lt;ref name="krist"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/30/books/burning-down-the-house.html Krist, Gary, "Burning Down The House"], ''The New York Times'', May 30, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He concluded with a caveat: "In her last two novels, the desire to outrage is so conspicuous that it risks obscuring her powerful gifts as a novelist."&lt;ref name="krist"/&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2003, the writer [[Ali Smith]] described Homes' second short story collection, ''[[Things You Should Know]],'' as "funny and glinting and masterful, light as air, strange as a dream, monstrous as truth: the real and classic thing."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Ali, ''The Guardian,'' "Fertile Ground: Ali Smith revels in A. M. Homes' Masterful Short Stories", May 21, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her novel, ''This Book Will Save Your Life'' (2006), was set in Los Angeles; it satirized upper-class residents and the city's culture. It featured "a rich, isolated man who suffers a physical crisis and goes on a wild compassion spree."&lt;ref name="tait"/&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' said that "it was kitschy and bordered on the inane, but there was something appealing about its mixture of the apocalyptic and the perkily upbeat, caught nicely by [[John Waters]] when he said: 'If Oprah went insane, this might be her favourite book.'"&lt;ref name="tait"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/19/may-we-be-forgiven-am-homes-review Theo Tait, "'May We Be Forgiven' by AM Homes - review"], ''The Guardian,'' 19 October 2012, accessed 1 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

With ''[[May We Be Forgiven]]'' (2012), Homes returned to a setting in [[Westchester County, New York]], the region described in several of her novels. Packed with violent, emotional incident in the first chapter, it won the [[Women's Prize for Fiction]] (formerly the Orange Prize), awarded in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="prize"/&gt;''The Guardian'' review described it as "a novel about forgiveness, family, intimacy, consumerism and the myth of success."&lt;ref name="groskop"/&gt; The reviewer said, "AM Homes can't really be compared to any other writer; no one else is quite as dark and funny and elegant all at the same time."&lt;ref name="groskop"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/14/am-homes-be-forgiven-review Viv Groskop, "'May We Be Forgiven' by AM Homes-review"], ''The Guardian'', 14 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Journalism===
Homes' articles and essays are published in magazines such as ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Artforum]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', and ''[[Timothy McSweeney's Quarterly Concern|McSweeney's]]'', among others. She has also been a contributing editor to ''[[BOMB Magazine]]'' since 1995, where she has published articles and interviews with various artists and writers, including [[Eric Fischl]], [[Tobias Wolff]], and [[Adam Bartos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bombsite.com/articles/search?search=a.m.+homes Bombsite.com A. M. Holmes articles] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502074720/http://bombsite.com/articles/search?search=a.m.+homes |date=May 2, 2011 }}, at [[BOMB (magazine)|BOMB]], Retrieved June 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' published "The Mistress's Daughter", her essay about meeting her biological parents for the first time at age 31; unmarried when she was born, they had immediately put her up for [[adoption]]. She expanded the essay about exploration of her "family" members and published her memoir in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.msn.com/news/article.aspx?news=224351|date=May 28, 2006|accessdate=March 8, 2007|title=A. M. Homes Throws Readers a Life Preserver|work=[[MSN]] Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
Homes wrote for season two of the television drama series, ''[[The L Word]],'' and produced season three. She developed an [[HBO]] series, ''The Hamptons'' about the resort towns along the ocean on eastern Long Island, which she described as "a cross between ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' and ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|Grapes of Wrath]]''."{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Since 2010, Homes has been developing television pilots for CBS with Timberman/Beverly Productions. In 2013 she was developing [[Koethi Zan]]'s best-selling novel, ''The Never List,'' as a dramatic series for CBS television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|title=OCT 17 6 DAYS CBS Adapting Koethi Zan's Best-Seller 'The Never List'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cbs-adapting-koethi-zans-best-649145|work=10/17/2013|publisher=''Hollywood Reporter''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homes was a writer and Co-Executive Producer on the 2017 USA Series Falling Water, and also a writer and Co-Executive Producer on the David Kelly Stephen King Series, Mr. Mercedes.&lt;ref&gt;IMDB https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0392977/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Homes lives in New York City with her daughter, Juliet, born in 2003. She has taught in the writing programs at [[Columbia University]], [[The New School]], and [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyceum Speakers Agency, [http://www.lyceumagency.com/a_m_+homes.aspx "A.M. Homes"], Lyceum Agency website, retrieved 3-20-2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 she was teaching in the Creative Writing Program at [[Princeton University]].

In her memoir ''The Mistress's Daughter'', Homes describes meeting her birth parents for the first time when she was 31. They were unmarried when she was born and put her up for adoption. Her birth mother Ellen Ballman was having an affair with her much older, married boss Norman Hecht when she became pregnant. Ballman initiated contact with Homes in hopes that her daughter might donate a kidney to her. Homes also met the members of her father's "legal" family.

Asked about her sexuality, Homes said in an April 2007 interview in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', "I've dated men and I've dated women and there's no more or less to it than that."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afterellen.com/people/2007/5/amhomes "Catching up with A. M. Homes"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012065607/http://www.afterellen.com/people/2007/5/amhomes |date=October 12, 2012 }}, Afterellen.com.

Homes – Author Interviews |publisher=Amhomesbooks.com |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''Diva'' magazine, she said, "I am bisexual, but I wouldn't necessarily define myself that way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.divamag.co.uk/diva/features.asp?PID=37647 "Interview with A.M. Homes"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226073037/http://www.divamag.co.uk/diva/features.asp?PID=37647 |date=February 26, 2011 }}, ''Diva'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a guest artist at the artists' collective [[Yaddo]], Homes was named as its co-chairwoman with [[Susan Unterberg]] in 2013. On this, she stated, "Without Yaddo, I wouldn't exist as a writer. Yaddo gives artists the increasingly rare gift of a time and place to do one's work, suspended from the intrusive buzz of the every day. I am forever indebted."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.saratogian.com/article/ST/20130909/NEWS/309099983|title=Yaddo board elects two artists to share chairmanship|last=|first=|date=2013-09-09|work=Saratogian News|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Homes has received numerous awards, including a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], a [[National Endowment for the Arts]] Fellowship, a Cullman Center Fellowship from the [[New York Public Library]], a [[Center for Scholars and Writers]] Fellowship, [[National Foundation for the Arts]] and [[New York Foundation for the Arts]] fellowships, and the [[Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis]]. Her work has been translated into 22 languages.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In June 2013, she won the prestigious [[Women's Prize for Fiction]]Women's Prize for Fiction&lt;ref name="prize"&gt;{{cite web|title=Winner – Women's Prize for Fiction|url=http://www.womensprizeforfiction.co.uk/2013-prize/2013-winner|access-date=June 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621054106/http://www.womensprizeforfiction.co.uk/2013-prize/2013-winner|archive-date=June 21, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly named the Orange Prize for Fiction) for her novel ''[[May We Be Forgiven]]'' (2012).

'''Asian-German Sports Exchange Program''' (AGSEP), is a [[non-governmental organisation]] operating in the development sector in [[Sri Lanka]] with a partner office in [[Essen]], [[Germany]]. AGSEP describes itself as Government Associated Organisation because of its consultancy status to the Sri Lankan Ministry of Disaster Relief Services and the Ministry for Rehabilitation &amp; District Development.

==Profile==
AGSEP works with volunteers; mainly with students from leading German universities doing undergraduate and postgraduate studies in the fields of [[economics]], [[political science]], [[social science]], [[engineering]], [[sport]] and other disciplines. The Asian German Sports Exchange Programme (A.G.S.E.P.)has been conducting sport events and international exchanges between Sri Lankan and European sport teams since 1989. The organisation is based in Marawila, in rural
western Sri Lanka, and was founded by the current CEO of the programme, Dr. Dietmar Döring, who at that time was the national coach of the table tennis team. Dr. Döring saw an opportunity to use sport events as an avenue to enhance tourism and
the relationships between estranged ethnic communities in Sri Lanka. The philosophy of A.G.S.E.P. is that sport is an ideal way of connecting people and transcending social, cultural, ethnic and religious cleavages. Sport provides a neutral platform for all participants, who are able to experience and learn from each other in a playful and open atmosphere.

AGSEP's mission it to assist the divided ethnic groups of Sri Lanka to find peace by exposing the children of the island to children of other ethnic groups as part of sporting events.&lt;ref name=PeaceFed&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peacefederation.org/news/field/asia/2006/index.php?report_id=817&amp;event_id=169 |title=Sri Lanka, gets an Inter-Cultural Peace Sports Centre |accessdate=2007-03-10 |last=Senaratne |first=Chula |date=August 9, 2006 |publisher=UPF/IIFWP }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Praktikum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.praktikum.info/arbeitgeber/1639/Asien_German_Sports_Exchange_Programme_(A.G.S.E.P.).html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517084031/http://www.praktikum.info/arbeitgeber/1639/Asien_German_Sports_Exchange_Programme_(A.G.S.E.P.).html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-05-17 |title=Asien German Sports Exchange Programme (A.G.S.E.P.) |accessdate=2007-03-10 |publisher=praktikum.info |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The German social education worker Dietmar Doering founded AGSEP while he was a national coach for the table tennis team of Sri Lanka.

Since 1989, against the background of a long-lasting civil war, AGSEP has promoted integrative sport events as peaceful intergroup sport encounters that popularise social values such as intercultural togetherness, respect, courage, commitment, and appreciation through active participation and exchange. Integrative sport events are planned, organised, implemented and staged in co-operation with the three major ethnic groups on the island, [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]], [[Tamil people|Tamil]]s and [[Muslim]]s.

[[Image:AMEB logo.png|right|125px]]
The '''Australian Music Examinations Board''' ('''AMEB''') is a federated, privately funded corporation which provides a program of examinations for music, speech and drama in Australia. 
The organisation had its beginnings at the Universities of Melbourne and Adelaide in 1887 and now has six state offices as well as a Federal Office in Melbourne. The Federal Board consists of representatives of educational institutions that are signatories to the AMEB constitution. These are the Universities of Melbourne, Adelaide and Western Australia, the Minister for Education and Training, New South Wales, the Minister for Education, Training and Employment, Queensland and the Minister for Education and Skills, Tasmania through the University of Tasmania.

AMEB examinations are based on syllabuses set by the Federal Board in conjunction with the music and speech and drama community. AMEB produces a range of publications which support students and teachers preparing for exams.

AMEB offers syllabuses and examinations in a broad range of subjects including:

* Music Teaching
* Music Theory (Theory of Music, Musicianship, Music Craft)
* Keyboard (Piano, Piano for Leisure, P Plate Piano, Organ, Electronic Organ)
* Strings (Violin, Viola, Cello, Double Bass, Classical Guitar, Harp)
* Woodwind (Recorder, Flute, Oboe, Clarinet, Bassoon, Saxophone, Saxophone for Leisure)
* Brass (Horn, Trumpet, Trombone, Bass Trombone, Tuba, Euphonium)
* Brass Band Instruments (Instruments in B flat, E flat and C)
* Percussion
* Voice (Singing, Singing for Leisure)
* Contemporary Popular Music (Keyboard, Vocal, Drum Kit, Guitar, Bass)
* Musical Ensembles (Brass, Mixed, Percussion, Strings, Woodwind)
* Speech and Drama

AMEB examinations cover a large range of skill levels; from a "Preliminary" grade suitable for very young children through to [[academic degree]]-level diplomas, including the ''[[Associate in Music, Australia|Associate in Music]]'' (AMusA), the ''[[Licentiate in Music, Australia|Licentiate in Music]]'' (LMusA), and ultimately the ''[[Fellowship in Music, Australia|Fellowship in Music]]'' (FMusA), a diploma that is often conferred on an honorary basis to musical luminaries.

AMEB has recently introduced online examinations for music theory and online courses for Theory of Music.

In addition to the standard syllabuses, AMEB has a series of "for leisure" syllabuses for the piano, saxophone and voice which contain a repertoire of modern music. AMEB also has a Contemporary Popular Music (CPM) offering for Keyboard, Drum Kit, Guitar, Bass and Voice.

'''Hanmun gyoyukyong gicho Hanja''' (lit. "basic [[Hanja]] for educational use") are a subset of Hanja defined in 1972 by a South Korean standard for educational use. 900 characters are expected to be learnt by middle school students and a further 900 at high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=CJKV Information Processing |authorlink=Ken Lunde |last=Lunde |first=Ken |page=84 |year=2008 |publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]] |isbn=978-0-596-51447-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of characters==
*Each [[hanja]] is sorted by the alphabetical order of the Sino-Korean reading.
*The "Grades" column indicates whether the character is taught in Middle School (grades 7–9) or High School (grades 10–12).
*For brevity, only one English translation is given per [[hanja]].
*The "Readings" column shows the Native Korean reading of the character first, followed by the Sino-Korean reading. Underneath the [[hangul]] forms are the Latin renditions according to the [[Revised_Romanization_of_Korean|Revised Romanization]], followed by a [[Hangul_consonant_and_vowel_tables|jamo]]-by-jamo transliteration without special provisions made for more accurate representation of phonology, but rather of spelling.
*This list is currently incomplete.

'''Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao''' ''(translation: ''Save girl child, educate a girl child'')'' is a personal campaign of the [[Government of India]] that aims to generate awareness and improve the efficiency of welfare services intended for girls. The scheme was launched with an initial funding of {{INRConvert|100|c}}.&lt;ref name="Beti_bachao_beti_padhao_campaign_24072014"/&gt; It mainly targets the clusters in [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Haryana]], [[Uttarakhand]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Bihar]] and [[Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-govt-sounds-alert-over-beti-bachao-beti-padhao-scheme-fraud/story-Qmns8pm4xqBtFyWNGMuyoI.html|title=UP govt sounds alert over Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme fraud|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|author=K Sandeep Kumar, Rajeev Mullick|date=19 May 2017|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/haryana-govt-cautions-people-against-frauds-under-beti-bachao-beti-padhao-scheme-4589990/|title=Haryana govt cautions people against frauds under Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao scheme|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=28 March 2017|author=[[Press Trust of India]]|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to census data, the [[child gender ratio]] (0–6 years) in India was 927 girls per 1,000 boys in 2001, which dropped to 918&lt;ref name="Beti_bachao_beti_padhao_campaign_24072014"/&gt; girls for every 1,000 boys in 2011. A 2012 [[UNICEF]] report ranked India 41st among 195 countries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} In the Population Census of 2011 it was revealed that the population ratio of India 2011 is 943 females per 1000 of males. The Sex Ratio 2011 shows an upward trend from the census 2001 data.

Speaking on the occasion of [International Day of the Girl Child] in 2015, the [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]], [[Narendra Modi]] had called for the eradication of [[female foeticide]] and invited suggestions from the citizens of India via the [[MyGov.in]] portal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-pm-narendra-modi-invites-ideas-on-beti-bachao-beti-padhao-2025163|title=PM Narendra Modi invites ideas on "Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao"|date=11 October 2014|work=DNA India |accessdate=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao (BBBP) [https://pradhanmantriyuvayojna.in/beti-bachao-beti-padhao-yojana/] scheme was launched on 22 January 2015 by Modi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/PM-to-Taunch-Beti-Bachao-Beti-Padhao-Programme-from-Haryana/2014/12/31/article2597270.ece|title=PM to Launch 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' Programme from Haryana|website=Newindianexpress.com|accessdate=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pm-narendra-modi-to-launch-beti-bachao-beti-padhao-programme-from-haryana/articleshow/45707186.cms|title=PM Narendra Modi to launch 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' programme from Haryana|work=The Economic Times|accessdate=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to address the issue of the declining child sex ratio image (CSR) and is a national initiative jointly run by the [[Ministry of Women and Child Development]], the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare]] and the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development]]. It initially focused multi-sector action in 100 districts throughout the country where there was a low CSR.

On 26 August 2016, Olympics 2016 bronze medallist [[Sakshi Malik]] was made brand ambassador for BBBP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sportscafe.in/articles/wrestling/2016/aug/24/sakshi-malik-to-be-brand-ambassador-of-beti-bachao-beti-padhao-campaign-in-haryana|title=Sakshi Malik to be brand ambassador of 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' campaign in Haryana|date=2016-08-24|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hashtag #SelfieWithDaughter was promoted on social media in June 2015, which started when Sunil Jaglan the [[sarpanch]] of the village Bibipur, [[Jind district|Jind]] in [[Haryana]] took a [[selfie]] with his daughter Nandini  and posted on Facebook on 9 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/how-pm-modis-beti-bachao-selfie-banao-campaign-became-a-rage-to-rewrite-gender-skewed-script-in-haryana/articleshow/47873120.cms |title=How PM Modi's Beti Bachao, Selfie Banao campaign became a rage to rewrite gender-skewed script in Haryana |publisher=''Economic Times'' |date=30 June 2015 |accessdate=1 July 2015 |author=Mohan, Rohini}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hashtag garnered worldwide fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/selfiewithdaughter-trends-worldwide-after-pm-modis-mann-ki-appeal-776114 |title=#SelfieWithDaughter Trends Worldwide After PM Modi's Mann ki Baat |author=Sanyal, Anindita |publisher=''NDTV'' |date=28 June 2015 |accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for this initiative==
{{further|Female foeticide in India}}
[[Sex-selective abortion]] or female foeticide has led to a sharp drop in the ratio of girls born in contrast to boy infants in some states in India. Ultrasound technology has made it possible for pregnant women and their families to learn the gender of a foetus early in a pregnancy. Discrimination against girl infants, for several reasons, has combined with the technology to result in a rise in abortions of foetuses identified as female during ultrasonic testing.

The trend was first noticed when results of the 1991 national census were released, and it was confirmed to be a worsening problem when results of the 2001 national census were released. The reduction in the female population of certain Indian states continues to worsen, as results of the 2011 national census have shown. It has been observed that the trend is most pronounced in relatively prosperous regions of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Selections from regional press, V|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[dowry system in India]] is often blamed; the expectation that a large [[dowry]] must be provided for daughters in order for them to marry is frequently cited as a major cause for the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Panwar|first=Preeti|title=Female foeticide: Death before birth|url=http://bankersadda.me/sukanya-thev-yojna-at-11-14-rate-of-interest/|publisher=Bankersadda|accessdate=September 27, 2012|date=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pressure for parents to provide large dowries for their daughters is most intense in prosperous states where high standards of living, and modern consumerism, are more prevalent in Indian society.

Rates of [[female foeticide]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]] are increasing; the rate of live births was 932 girls per 1000 boys in 2001, which dropped to 918 by 2011. It is expected that if this trend continues, by 2021 the number of girls will drop below 900 per 1000 boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gupta|first=Suchandana|title=Skewed sex ratio: MP launches 'Beti Bachao Abhiyan'|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Skewed-sex-ratio-MP-launches-Beti-Bachao-Abhiyan/articleshow/10212751.cms|accessdate=September 27, 2012|newspaper=Times of India|date=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategies used==
Strategies employed to successfully carry out the scheme are:
*Implement a sustained social mobilization and communication campaign to create equal value for the girl child and promote her education.
*Place the issue of decline in child sex ratio/sex ratio at birth in public discourse, improvement of which would be an indicator for good governance.
*Focus on gender critical districts and cities.

==Support==
The [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] has formed a National Executive Committee to promote Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) across the country. The committee is organising a number of programs to promote "Save Girl Child" and "to Educate Girl Child" since January 2015.  Dr. Rajendra Phadke is the National Convener of BBBP Abhiyan.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} 

The Beti Bachao campaign is also supported by the [[Indian Medical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Indian Medical Association|year=2007|volume=105|issue=7-12|page=711|title=Indian Medical Association|publisher=Indian Medical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bompeh Senior High Technical School''' is a senior high school located in [[Sekondi-Takoradi]] in the [[Western Region (Ghana)|Western Region]] of [[Ghana]].

==History==
The school used to be one of the Axim Road Middle Schools. It was selected, expanded and developed into a [[Middle school|junior high school]] by the [[Ministry of Education (Ghana)|Ghana Education Service]] in September 1976 and was named '''Axim Road Experimental Junior High School'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.modernghana.com/news/287189/bompeh-senior-high-technical-school-celebrates-silver-jubile.html|title=Bompeh Senior High Technical School celebrates silver jubilee|website=Modern Ghana|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1985, upon the request of the Regional Directorate, the Director General of Education service upgraded the school to a [[Secondary school|senior high school]] level and the school was christened '''Bompeh Day Secondary School''' after the deceased Sekondi chief who showed much interest in education matters during his reign. It was not, however, until 1989 that the first batch of O/L{{clarify|date=May 2016|reason= what is this}} students were presented. Former students of the school are popularly known as Young Royals, and students in the school are called Bompehrian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghanavisions.com/articles/6329-takoradi.html|title=Takoradi|website=ghanavisions.com|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chemicus: Journey to the Other Side''''' is a 2001 educational adventure game by HEUREKA-Klett Softwareverlag as part of Tivola's "Quest for Knowledge" series. A sequel named '''''Chemicus II: Die versunkene Stadt''''' was released in 2002. The game was originally released in Germany.

== Gameplay ==
The first-person game has gameplay similar to ''Myst'' and ''Riven.''

== Plot ==
The player is a friend of Richard, a chemistry lover who is falsely accused of stealing a treaured item from the land of Chemicus after he arrives there in a portal. It is the player's job to rescue him.

The game has no death states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407092141/http://www.uhs-hints.com/articles/reviews/chemicus.php|title=UHS: Chemicus Review|date=2016-04-07|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
Eblong likened the game's puzzle design to games such as ''Zork Grand Inquisitor'', ''Myst'', and ''Traitors Gate'' though noted that puzzles are completed by doing chemistry experiments rather than using spells, in-universe mythology or technological gizmos respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eblong.com/zarf/gamerev/chemicus.html|title=Review: Chemicus|website=www.eblong.com|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metzomagic praised the game's graphics and musical score, and deemed it harder than its sister games [[Physicus]] and [[Bioscopia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metzomagic.com/showArticle.php?index=520|title=Chemicus Review by metzomagic.com|website=www.metzomagic.com|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adventure Gamers thought the concept was admirable and was interesting in playing the sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041104191958/http://www.adventuregamers.com:80/display.php?id=224|title=Chemicus {{!}} Adventure Gamers|date=2004-11-04|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adventure Archiv thought the puzzles were fastidiously designed and that chemistry concepts were seamlessly integrated into the gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311070649/http://adventurearchiv.de/c/chemicusreviewen.htm|title=Chemicus - Review english|date=2016-03-11|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gameboomers gave the game very high praise and was excited to try the other two games in the series,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330111618/http://www.gameboomers.com/reviews/Cc/Chemicusbysyd.htm|title=Chemicus review by syd|date=2016-03-30|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mr Bills Adventure Land went away with a similar impression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322024130/http://mrbillsadventureland.com/reviews/c-d/chemicusR/chemicusR.htm|title=Chemicus Review - Mr. Bill's Adventureland|date=2016-03-22|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tap Repeatedly highly recommended the game as a chemistry learning tool for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tap-repeatedly.com/Reviews/Chemicus/Chemicus.shtml|title=Four Fat Chicks -- Chemicus Review|website=www.tap-repeatedly.com|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AV Vault gave the game high praise, and noted that it managed to overcome the negative stigma around educational games as having "terrible graphics, shallow stories, little replay value, and shoddy production values".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504114127/http://avault.com:80/reviews/review_temp.asp?game=chemi|title=AVault {{!}} PC {{!}} Chemicus: Journey to the Other Side Review|date=2006-05-04|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528021804/http://avault.com:80/reviews/review_temp.asp?game=chemi&amp;page=2|title=AVault {{!}} PC {{!}} Chemicus: Journey to the Other Side Review|date=2006-05-28|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041121141525/http://www.avault.com:80/reviews/review_temp.asp?game=chemi&amp;page=3|title=AVault {{!}} PC {{!}} Chemicus: Journey to the Other Side Review|date=2004-11-21|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just Adventure noted that while there was an overarching goal, there was no plot-related logical reasoning given for the player to complete each individual puzzle, beside the fact that they can't progress to different areas until they do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://justadventure.com/2013-05-20-21-09-14/1099-chemicus|title=Throwback Thursday: Chemicus|last=Tait|first=Alexander|website=justadventure.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Adventure Gamers thought the game could have been served better by having a juicier story that matched its intriguing world and puzzles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://adventuregamers.com/articles/view/17597|title=Chemicus Review|website=Adventure Gamers|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; GameSpy offered a mixed review, but ultimately gave it a 1 star rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908080721/http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/chemicus/5669p1.html|title=GameSpy: Chemicus - Page 1|date=2015-09-08|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mystery Manor wrote that the addition of a narrator would have sharply improved the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805000429/http://mysterymanor.net/reviewchemicus.htm|title=Mystery Manor Chemicus Review|date=2016-08-05|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more citations needed|date=September 2013}}
}}

The '''Chinese university ranking''' is a ranking of universities in mainland China by Netbig, an internet company focused on higher education, founded by Jiang Jining, who graduated from University of Science and Technology of China. The ranking is conducted annually since 1999, and is generally released in July, around the time of college entrance examination. This ranking, however, has ceased to publish newer versions since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netbig.com/ Official site displaying only the 2013 version]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ranking methods ==
There are seven different ranking systems in Chinese university ranking (Netbig).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title      = 2013中国大学排名,2013大学排名,中国大学排行榜,综合指标排行 网大,网大-教育机构的价值发现者netbig.com！
|url=http://rank2013.netbig.com
| accessdate = {{date|23 mar 2013}}
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ranking system is "comprehensive(overall) ranking", which is based on 2~7th ranking system.

The second ranking system is based on "reputation".

The third ranking system is based on “academic resources”.

The fourth ranking system is based on "academic achievement".

The fifth ranking system is based on "student ability".

The sixth ranking system is based on "professor honor"

The seventh ranking system is based on "reserve fund".

==Criticism==
After its first release Netbig was sued by a [[Renmin University of China]] alumnus for committing libel to his Alma mater, by ranking the school 25th when it has the best law school in China. An official from the Chinese Ministry of Education commented on the ranking as being "baseless" and "completely without scientific studies."&lt;ref name="高校排行榜又引风波 人大毕业生状告网大"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://edu.sina.com.cn/edu/2000-08-17/10240.shtml | title=高校排行榜又引风波 人大毕业生状告网大 | accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="不满母校排名低 人大学子告“网大”"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tech.sina.com.cn/internet/china/2000-07-10/30271.shtml | title=不满母校排名低 人大学子告"网大" | accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some also argued that Netbig did not but should have considered employment data in ranking the universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edu.sina.com.cn/gaokao/2011-06-07/2056299478.shtml 为什么网大不把就业率作为指标]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cognitive academic language proficiency''' ('''CALP''') is a language-related term developed by [[Jim Cummins (professor)|Jim Cummins]] which refers to formal [[academic]] learning, as opposed to [[Basic interpersonal communicative skills|BICS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cummins|first1=James|title=Cognitive/academic language proficiency, linguistic  interdependence, the optimum age question and some other matters.|journal=Working  Papers on Bilingualism|date=1979|volume=19|pages=121–129|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED184334|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In schools today, the terms BICS and CALP are most frequently used to discuss the [[language proficiency]] levels of students who are in the process of acquiring a new language. These students typically develop proficiency in BICS well before they acquire a strong grasp of CALP or academic language. As a result, students may initially appear fully proficient and fluent, while still struggling with significant language gaps. 

In a 1996 ethnographic study of Salvadorean students in [[Washington, D.C.]], Carolyn Vincent found that the students' language attainments were "largely deceptive".&lt;ref&gt;Paulston, Christine Bratt and G. Richard Tucker, eds. ''Sociolinguistics:The Essential Readings.'' Malden, Ma.: Wiley-Blackwell, 2003, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; Students were less proficient than they appeared because they were able "to converse on a few everyday, frequently discussed subjects" but often lacked proficiency in academic language.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Paulston. p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; Carolyn Edelsky was an early critic of the BICS/CALP distinction, arguing that academic language is measured inaccurately through a reliance on "test-wiseness".&lt;ref&gt;Paulston, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; Cummins countered this by noting that academic language proficiency does not rely "on test scores as support for either its construct validity or relevance to education".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Further, it is tempting for teachers and administrators to move students with a high BICS (Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills/Social Language Proficiency) level into a 'mainstream' class because they 'sound' like the other kids on the playground.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Although the terms BICS and CALP are still widely used, Cummins has more recently used the terms ''conversational language'' and ''academic language''.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarria, Jana. (2007). Sheltered Content Instruction: Teaching English Language Learners with Diverse Abilities. Special Edition, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Instructors of [[bilingual education]]al environments, Cummins tells us, should be mindful that a student's apparent ability to interact at a high cognitive level on the 'street' does not necessarily imply the same cognitive or communications ability in the 'class'.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Cummins insists that a more thorough [[Test (student assessment)|assessment]] of the student's academic language abilities be performed before moving the student out of a 'sheltered' language development environment.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

'''Digital civics''' refers a range of [[Ethics|ethical]] and responsible civic behaviours, [[citizenship]], or democratic engagement in the [[Internet|digital realm]]. The term itself is still establishing currency.

== Context ==

Digital civics has arisen from concerns regarding the challenges faced by individuals and society in the digital age. As science and technology have advanced, so too has human understanding of their place in the world. This has altered the way people interact with one another and the broader context in which they exist. Digital civics respond to these challenges by formulating a robust foundation upon which initiatives into digital citizenship and digital citizen engagement can be developed.

== Definitions ==

Researcher Estelle Clements defines digital civics as “the study of the rights and responsibilities of citizens who inhabit the infosphere and access the world digitally.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Clements, who was a doctoral researcher at the [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] at the time, first put forward this definition in 2010 as part of an educational project done in conjunction with the [[Dublin City Public Libraries and Archive]]. The goal of their project was to teach about life in the online world.

According to Clements this definition meets three objectives:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

# It promotes an understanding of the environment where civic actions take place;
# It acknowledges the information philosophy that underpins this environment;
# It endorses the policy discourse that addresses the basic rights and ethical responsibilities of citizens.

Other conceptions of digital civics are still emerging. [[Newcastle University]] has suggested that Digital Civics is about “Digital technologies and citizen-driven design”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcivics.io/about/|title=About|website=digitalcivics.io|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy of information ==

Numerous scholars have suggested that the [[Philosophy of Information]] is the most logical course to underpin policy and project work for life in the digital age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Media Ethics.|last=Ess|first=Charles|publisher=Polity Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Floridi|first=Luciano|date=2009|title=The Information Society and its Philosophy|url=|journal=The Information Society|volume=25(3)|pages=153–158.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Information Philosopher [[Luciano Floridi]] has played a critical role in the success of such work, particularly in exploration of [[Information society|Information Society]], European Policy, and [[European Commission]]’s Onlife initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9783319040929|title=The Onlife Manifesto - Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era {{!}} Luciano Floridi|publisher=Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

Clements identifies four underlying pillars that contribute to a robust digital civics as well as four key concepts in which digital civics is grounded.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Estelle|first=Clements,|date=2017|title=Digital Civics in Pedagogy: A Response to the Challenges of Digital Convergence in the Educational Environment|url=https://arrow.dit.ie/appadoc/88/|journal=ARROW@DIT|language=en|doi=10.21427/D7J45F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcivics.org/about/|title=What is Digital Civics|last=|first=|date=2018|website=digitalcivics.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Underlying pillars of Digital Civics   ===

Philosophy (specifically the [[Philosophy of information|Philosophy of Information]] as described by Luciano Floridi&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luciano|first=Floridi|date=2002|title=What is the philosophy of information|url=|journal=Metaphilosophy|volume=33|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  
 
History (drawing from [[Media ecology|Media Ecology]] and [[Classics|Classical scholarship]]),

Ethics (particularly [[Virtue ethics|Virtue Ethics]])

Civics (including the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], as well as a conjoining of the public and private personas called Hybrid selves&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ess|first=Charles|date=2010|title=The Embodied Self in a Digital Age: Possibilities, Risks, and Prospects for a Pluralistic (democratic/liberal) Future?|url=|journal=Nordicom Information|volume=32(2)|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Key concepts for Digital Civics ===
- It acknowledges the transformations in human life and our world brought about by new scientific breakthroughs and technological developments, and the impact these changes have on how we behave.

- It recognises the importance of responding to these changes in ethical and intellectually rigorous ways.

- And it appreciates that we have a long historical tradition from which to draw when addressing these challenges.

- Fundamental to Digital Civics is an appreciation of the informational nature of reality.

== Contention of digital civics and virtue ethics ==

In considering the ethical issues that arise from digital age civic issues, numerous scholars have suggested that such ethical initiatives should use [[virtue ethics]] as a basis for a shared global [[information ethics]]: namely, Charles Ess,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charles|first=Ess|date=2010|title=Trust and New Communications Technologies: Vicious Circles, Virtuous Circles, Possible Futures.|url=|journal=Knowledge, Technology &amp; Policy|volume=23(3-4)|pages=287–305|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Shannon Vallor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology and the Virtues: A philosophical guide to a future worth wanting.|last=Vallor|first=Shannon|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Richard Volkman&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Volkman|first=Richard|date=2010|title=Why Information Ethics must begin with Virtue Ethics|url=|journal=Metaphilosophy|volume=41|pages=380–401|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2010). In her doctoral work on digital civics pedagogy, Clements suggests that her findings were compatible with a framework of virtue ethics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the Information philosopher [[Luciano Floridi]] asserts that a global information ethics cannot be built upon virtue ethics because virtue ethics is “intrinsically egopoeitic”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ethics of Information|last=Floridi|first=Luciano|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Oxford, UK|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus does not take into account responsibilities owed to the surrounding community or environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge handbook of information and computer ethics|last=Floridi|first=Luciano|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, this matter is still contested.

== Educational programs ==

In 2010, the first pedagogical program for digital civics was started by the Oscar Wilde Facebook Laboratory. It was a collaboration between [[Dublin City Public Libraries and Archive]] and the [[Dublin Institute of Technology]]'s, Estelle Clements. A global team of researchers and educators created a multi-platform (online and offline) learning environment to teach students and the public about digital civics. The project formed the basis of Clements’ doctoral work which formulated a Model for Digital Civics in [[Pedagogy]]. At the time, Clements was particularly concerned that new digital citizenship initiatives were not considering the necessary underlying philosophical and ethical issues raised by the digital age and sought to provide a robust foundation to solve this problem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2014 Newcastle University, launched a program to teach digital civics to postgraduate students at their Open Lab . The program research concentrates on “exploring how digital technologies can empower citizens and communities”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcivics.io/|title=Digital Civics at Open Lab|website=digitalcivics.io|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and “trains doctoral students in the design, deployment and evaluation of community-driven digital technologies and services.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcivics.io/apply/|title=Centre for Doctoral Training in Digital Civics|website=digitalcivics.io|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[The MacArthur Research Network on Youth and Participatory Politics (YPP) released a digital civics toolkit described as: “a collection of resources for educators to support youth to explore, recognize, and take seriously the civic potentials of digital life.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitalcivicstoolkit.org/|title=Digital Civics Toolkit|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The toolkit draws heavily from digital media literacy, focusing on 5 modules: Exploring Community Issues, Investigation, Dialogue, Voice, and Action”.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3395">'''Francis Aupiais''' (11 August 1877 – 14 December 1945) was a French [[Roman Catholic]] missionary, anthropologist, and writer.

He was born in [[Saint-Père-en-Retz]] and studied at the Missions Africains de Lyon seminary. He was ordained a priest in 1902.&lt;ref name=dacb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dacb.org/stories/benin/aupiais-francis.html |title=Francis Aupiais|work=Dictionary of African Christian Biography |publisher=Dacb.org |date=1 April 2007 |accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He briefly worked in Senegal before being sent to [[Dahomey]]. In 1903, he was named vicar of [[Abomey]], and soon took on several other administrative roles in [[Porto-Novo]].&lt;ref name=Benin67/&gt; Aupiais was reassigned to [[Dakar]] from 1915 to 1918. At the end of World War I, he returned to Dahomey and served as director of mission schools.&lt;ref name=dacb/&gt; Aupiais was an important religious figure and helped advance the careers of [[Paul Hazoumé]] and [[Sourou-Migan Apithy]].&lt;ref name=Benin67&gt;Houngnikpo &amp; Decalo 2013, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1925, Aupiais founded the journal ''La Reconnaissance Africaine'', striving to publish ethnographic studies by Dahomeyans and popularize African culture abroad. He was a strident admirer of the indigenous culture and integrated traditional music, costumes and dances into religious celebrations.&lt;ref name=dacb/&gt;

In 1926, he returned to Paris and sought to end forced labor in the colonies and joined the executive committee of the annual Louvain Missiology Week. Aupiais studied at the newly opened [[Institute of Ethnology]] in Paris from 1926 to 1928. That year, he became Provincial of the [[Lyon Province]] SMA, serving until 1931. Between 1929-1930 he produced two films, one a documentary on Catholic mission efforts in Dahomey, ''Le Dahomey Chrétien'', the other an ethnographic film of traditional religious ceremonies, ''Le Dahomey religieux'', which was censored in 1931. In 1938, he published ''Le Missionnaire'', an overview of his colonial life and work in Africa.&lt;ref name=dacb/&gt; The following year, his ethnological work led to him being admitted to the Academy of Colonial Sciences. Although he lived in France during this period, he frequently travelled to [[Porto-Novo]]. On 18 October 1945, he was elected to serve as the first representative from Dahomey in the [[National Assembly of France|French Assembly]]. However, he fell ill and died on 14 December 1945 in France. His protege Apithy succeeded him.&lt;ref name=Benin67/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15953">'''Free education''' is [[education]] funded through taxation or charitable organizations rather than tuition funding. Many models of free higher education have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/01/20/should-college-be-free/public-higher-education-should-be-universal-and-free|title=Public Higher Education Should Be Universal and Free}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Primary school]] and other [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]] or [[compulsory education]] is free in many countries, for example, and all education is mostly free (often not including books (from primary) and a number of administrative and sundry fees in university) including [[post-graduate studies]] in the [[Nordic countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.skolverket.se/om-skolverket/andra-sprak/in-english/the-swedish-education-system/an-overview-of-the-swedish-education-system-1.72184 The Swedish School System] Retrieved 20 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The Article 13 of [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] ensures the right to free education at primary education and progressive introduction of it at [[secondary education|secondary]] and [[higher education]] as the [[right to education]].&lt;ref&gt;[[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], Article 13, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In University of Oslo, there is no tuition fee except small semester fee of NOK(600) (74 USD). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Scholarships for International Students|url=http://uscollegeinternational.com/2017/08/18/university-oslo-free-tuition/|website=uscollegeinternational.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2013 in [[Northern Europe]], [[Estonia]] started providing free higher education as well. [[Sweden]], until the early 21st century, provided free education to foreign students but changes have been introduced to charge fees to foreign students from outside the [[European community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsv.se/lawsandregulations/theswedishhighereducationact.4.5161b99123700c42b07ffe3956.html#svid4|title=UKÄ och UHR|author=|date=|website=www.hsv.se|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denmark]] also has universal free education, and provides a monthly stipend, the "Statens Uddannelsesstøtte" or "SU",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.su.dk/|title=Forside|publisher=su.dk|access-date=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to students over 18 years of age or students who are under 18 and attending a [[higher education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.su.dk/Nyheder/Sider/Nuogs%C3%A5SUtilungeunder18.aspx|title=404 - side ikke fundet - su.dk|author=|date=|website=www.SU.dk|access-date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachelor and master's degree programmes in Denmark are offered in either Danish or English depending on the programme or university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdu.dk/en/Uddannelse/Bachelor|title=Bachelor – Syddansk Universitet|publisher=Sdu.dk|date=18 April 2016|access-date=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Education in Cuba|Cuba]], [[Education in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Education in the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]], [[Education in Greece|Greece]], [[Education in Turkey|Turkey]] and [[Education in Argentina|Argentina]] provide free education at all levels, including college and university for its citizens.

==Countries==
In [[Brazil]], free education is offered by the Ministry of Education, which offers scholarships for graduate degrees, masters, doctoral and post-doctoral for Brazilians and immigrants who have Brazilian citizenship. The best universities and research centers are public institutions, financed by either the local state (state universities) or the federal government (federal universities). Graduate students can get paid if they qualify for the incentive but competition is extremely fierce. There has been a proliferation in the last 10 years of private universities which are interested in providing professional training to their undergraduates. These private colleges are not interested in nurturing research centers, since it is not part of their business model to get involved with research.

In [[Iran]], most prestigious universities are called governmental universities which offer free education for students who pass a very competitive entrance exam with high scores. Graduates from these universities are obliged to serve the country for as many years as they studied for their degree, in order to get their diploma. 

[[Uruguay]] adopted free, compulsory, and secular education in 1876, after a reform led by [[José Pedro Varela]] during the [[Lorenzo Latorre]] dictatorship. The [[University of the Republic (Uruguay)|University of the Republic]] follows the same principles, although graduates must pay a yearly contribution.

In [[Fiji]] the government announced in 2013 it would cover the costs of primary and secondary school education, equivalent to 250 Fiji dollars per year per student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/227158/free-education-for-primary-and-secondary-school-students-in-fiji|title=Free education for primary and secondary school students in Fiji |publisher=Radio NZ |date=8 November 2013|access-date=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sri Lanka]], free education is provided by the government at different levels. Government funded schools such as [[National school (Sri Lanka)|national schools]], provincial schools and [[Pirivena|piriven]] provided primary and secondary education free, while assisted schools and semi-governmental schools provided the same at subsidized rates. At the university level, the  universities provide undergraduate courses free, however, this totals only about 10% for those qualified for university entrance. Grants and scholarships are provided for a limited number of study allowances. Hon.C.W.W.Kannangara who was the Minister of Education made education free for all Sri Lankan students in 1940 s. Kannangara's significant achievements in areas of education have led him to being commonly referred to as the Father of Free Education in Sri Lanka. Health services of Sri Lanka are also free.

Elsewhere, free education usually comes to students in the form of scholarships and grants, if they cover all or most of students' expenses. Individuals, institutions, and advocacy initiatives are examples of providers of grants and scholarships. They may have economic (e.g. tax-deductibility), humanitarian, charitable or religious motivations.

There are examples of steps towards free education being taken across the world primarily in those nations developing rapidly, such as [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6174847.stm|title=China ends school fees for 150m|publisher=BBC news|date=2006-12-13|access-date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Philippines]], free public tertiary education has been [[Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act|enacted in 2017]].

In [[Mauritius]], the government provides free education to its citizens from pre-primary to secondary levels. Since July 2005, the government also introduced free transport for all students.

In [[New Zealand]], the Labour government will introduce three years of free post-school study or training. In 2018 new students will have one year free for entering study or training from January 1 2018. From 2021 those starting tertiary education would get two years free, and from 2024 three years. The overall cost of the package is $6 billion. Labour has also pledged to increase student allowances by $50 a week, and to restore post-graduate students' eligibility for student allowances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11935250|title=Free university study just months away|publisher=NZ Herald |date=21 October 2017|access-date=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In European countries such as [[France]] and [[Malta]], tuition is usually free for European students, and in [[Germany]], tuition is free for all European and international students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/22/world/europe/want-education-cant-pay-germany/ |title=World-class education that costs nothing |publisher=CNN.com |date= |access-date=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scotland]] University tuition is free for all Scottish nationals and is discounted for all European students, except from students coming from other parts of the [[United Kingdom]].

In Russia, prior to the destruction of the USSR, tuition was free for everyone obtaining sufficient grades. Since 1991, if a student obtains sufficient grades, he or she is still eligible for a free education (on a competitive basis) in state or private universities, but he/she can also pay for studying if grades are above minimal threshold, but not enough to be enrolled into desired university for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zakon-ob-obrazovanii.ru/100.html|title=Закон об образовании Статья 100.

[[Trinidad and Tobago]] offers free tertiary education to its citizens up to the undergraduate level at accredited public and select private institutions. Postgraduate degrees are paid up to 50% by the government at accredited institutions. This benefit is given to the citizens under a programme called Government Assisted Tuition Expenses Programme and it is managed by the Funding and Grants Administration Division of the Ministry of Tertiary Education and Skills Training&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Willies|first1=Egberto|title=These countries give free college education to their citizens|url=https://factualinfo.com/2016/02/23/these-countries-give-free-college-education-to-their-citizens/|website=Factualinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], students pay tuition to attend Community Colleges, with many taking on debt in the form of Federal Loans i.e. "Student Loans".

==History==
Free education has long been identified with "sponsored education". This may now evoke images of advertising campaigns, but in the past, especially during the [[Renaissance]], it was common practice among rich dignitaries to sponsor the education of a young man as his patron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404900332.html|title=Education – FREE Education information {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: Find Education research|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Jefferson proposed, "establishing free schools to teach reading, writing, and arithmetic, and from these schools those of intellectual ability, regardless of background or economic status, would receive a college education paid for by the state."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/civic-education/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Crittenden|first=Jack|last2=Levine|first2=Peter|date=1 January 2013|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the first free public institution of higher education, the Free Academy of the City of New York (today the [[City College of New York]]), was founded in 1847 with the aim of providing free education to the urban poor, immigrants and their children. Its graduates went on to receive 10 Nobel Prizes, more than at any other public university.&lt;ref&gt;"... the founding, in 1847, of the Free Academy, the very first free public institution of higher education in the nation.", Baruch College history website. [http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/about/glance.html]&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 19th century, the government's [[compulsory education]] was introduced as free or universal education, and extended across the country by the 1920s. 

Compulsory education is typically funded through taxes. Aggravated [[truancy]] can be prosecuted. Homeschooling, private or parochial schooling is usually a legal alternative. 

As of the start of many free internet-based learning institutions such as [[edX]] and [[mitX]], education is now free to anyone in the world with internet access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MITx|url=https://www.edx.org/school/mitx|website=edx.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, the policy for the [[merit system]] has not yet caught up with these recent advances in education technology.

==On the Internet==
Online education has become an option in recent years, particularly with the development of free [[MOOC]]s (massive open online courses) from providers such as [[Khan Academy]] (High School) and Higher Education, through providers such as [[Udacity]], [[Alison (company)|Alison]], World Education University (WEU) and [[Coursera]]. Free education has become available through several websites with some resembling the courses of study of accredited universities. Online education faces barriers such as institutional adoption, license or copyright restrictions, incompatibility and educator awareness of available resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capetowndeclaration.org/read-the-declaration|title=The Cape Town Open Education Declaration|publisher=Capetowndeclaration.org|access-date=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the extensive requirements of resources for online education, many open community projects have been initiated. Specifically, the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] has developed a project devoted to [[open access|free online]] educational resources, [[Wikiversity]], and recently, several other sites for specific topics have developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikimedia Foundation|url=https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home|website=Wikimediafoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Leaders Institute]] offers tuition free college level ministry education. Students can take any classes free of charge, but are encouraged to help support the mission of the institution by making donations to this [[501(c) organization|501 (c)3]]  United States Charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.christianleadersinstitute.org/online-ministry-training-admission|title=Online Ministry Training Admission - Free Training|language=en-US|access-date=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other examples==
Free education does not only take the form of publicly funded institutions like state universities.

In France, philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] created the first non-governmental free education university since [[Ancient history|antiquity]], in 2002, with his [[Université populaire de Caen]] in [[Normandy]]. His decision was triggered by the accession of far-right party [[Front National]] to the second round of the [[French presidential election (2002)|2002 French presidential elections]]. Onfray stated that people need more political, historical and philosophical background education to be more conscious citizens. His university is run by an [[Voluntary association#France|association loi 1901]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.portail-de-la-gratuite.com/culture-education/philosophie/l-universit%C3%A9-populaire-de-caen/|title=La Contre-Histoire de la philosophie : l'Université Populaire de Caen enfin disponible en podcasts|trans-title=The Contra-History of Philosophy: the Popular University of Caen finally available on podcasts|language=fr|date=3 November 2009|access-date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intuition''' is the ability to acquire knowledge without [[proof (truth)|proof]], [[evidence]], or conscious [[reason]]ing, or without understanding how the knowledge was acquired.&lt;ref name="Webster dictionary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxford dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |title=intuition|url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/intuition |accessdate= 22 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Different writers give the word "intuition" a great variety of different meanings, ranging from direct access to unconscious knowledge, unconscious cognition, inner sensing, inner insight to unconscious pattern-recognition and the ability to understand something instinctively, without the need for conscious reasoning.&lt;ref name="AurobindoDef"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Aurobindo |first1=  Sri  |title=The synthesis of yoga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ex6cSqqBSwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=479–480|publisher=Sri Aurobindo ashram trust |location=Pondicherry |isbn= 978-0-9415-2465-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenblatt&gt;Intuition and consciousness – Rosenblatt AD, Thickstun JT.

The word ''intuition'' comes from the Latin verb ''intueri'' translated as "consider" or from the [[Late Middle Ages|late middle English]] word ''intuit'', "to contemplate".&lt;ref name="Webster dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |title=intuition|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intuition |access-date= 22 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Both [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern]] and [[Western philosophy|Western]] philosophers have studied the concept in great detail. [[Philosophy of mind]] deals with the concept of intuition.

===Eastern philosophy===
In the East intuition is mostly intertwined with [[religion]] and [[spirituality]], and various meanings exist from different religious texts.&lt;ref name="eastern"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leaman |first1=Oliver   |title=Eastern Philosophy: Key Readings |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=FLuEAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 December 2014 |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn= 0-415-17357-4 |pages=5–40 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
In Hinduism various attempts have been made to interpret the [[Vedas|Vedic]] and other esoteric texts.

For [[Sri Aurobindo]]  intuition comes under the realms of knowledge by identity, he describes the psychological plane in human (often referred to as mana in [[sanskrit]]) has two arbitrary nature, the first being imprinting of psychological experiences which is constructed through sensory information (mind seeking to become aware of external world). The second nature being the action when it seeks to be aware of itself, resulting in humans being aware of their existence or aware of being angry &amp; aware of other emotions, he terms this second nature is knowledge by identity.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=68|ps=}}
He finds that at present as the result of evolution the mind has accustomed itself to depend upon certain physiological functioning and their reactions as its normal means of entering into relation with outer material world, as a result when we seek to know about external world the dominant habit is through arriving at truth about things via as much as senses convey to us.  However, with  knowledge by identity which we currently only gives the awareness of human beings existence can be extended further to outside of ourselves resulting in intuitive knowledge.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|pp=69-71|ps=}}

He finds this intuitive knowledge was common to older humans ([[Vedic]]) and later was taken over by [[reason]] which currently organises our perception, thoughts and actions resulting in from Vedic to metaphysical philosophy and later to experimental science. he finds that this process which seems to be a decent, is actual a circle of progress.  As a lower faculty is being pushed to take up as much from a higher way of working.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=75|ps=}} He finds when self-awareness in mind is applied to own-self and the outer (other-Self), results in luminous self-manifest identity, the reason also converts itself into the form of the self-luminous intuitional knowledge.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=72|ps=}}&lt;ref name="Integral yoga"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Aurobindo |first1=  Sri  |title=The synthesis of yoga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ex6cSqqBSwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=799–800|publisher=Sri Aurobindo ashram trust |location=Pondicherry |isbn= 978-0-9415-2465-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=7|ps=}}

[[Rajneesh|Osho]] believed consciousness of human beings to be in increasing order from basic animal [[instinct]]s to intelligence and intuition, and humans being constantly living in that conscious state often moving between these states depending on their affinity and he also suggests living in the state of intuition is one of the ultimate aims of humanity.&lt;ref name="osho"&gt;{{cite book |last1= osho |first1=  Bhagwan  |title=Intuition: Knowing Beyond Logic |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=zyBfk5V5HRkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=osho+on+intuition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y8maVNOMEInzPJHLgbgN&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=24 December 2014 |pages=10–20|publisher=osho international foundation |location=New York |isbn= 0-312-27567-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Advaita]] vedanta (a school of thought) takes intuition to be an experience through which one can come in contact with and experience [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name="advaita"&gt;{{cite book |last1= M. Indich |first1=  William   |title=Consciousness in Advaita Vedanta|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=7ykZjWOiBMoC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=advaitha+on+intuition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=49CaVPG_HIHlOJOygfAP&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=advaitha%20on%20intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=24 December 2014 |pages=8–10|publisher=Motilal banarisdas |location=varanasi |isbn= 81-208-1251-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddhism====
Buddhism finds intuition being a faculty in the mind of immediate knowledge and puts the term intuition beyond mental process of conscious [[thinking]], as the conscious intellect cannot necessarily access subconscious information, or render such information into a communicable form.&lt;ref name="Sumedho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buddhismnow.com/2013/08/07/buddha-by-ajahn-sumedho/|title=Buddha, by  Ajahn Sumedho|work=Buddhism now}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Zen Buddhism]] various techniques have been developed to help develop ones intuitive capability, such as [[koans]] – the resolving of which leads to states of minor enlightenment ([[satori]]). In parts of Zen Buddhism intuition is deemed a mental state between the Universal mind and one's individual, discriminating mind.&lt;ref name="Bdictionary"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Humphreys |first1= Christmas |title=A Popular Dictionary of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TlWRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT406&amp;dq=intuition+in+buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=enmZVNyjLs32O8vlgdAM&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition%20in%20buddhism&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 December 2014 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn= 0-203-98616-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zen Buddhism"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Conners |first1=  Shawn  |title=Zen Buddhism – The Path to Enlightenment |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zVPUsSW-by0C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=intuition+in+buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iXeZVLu3LsjDOZjFgfgD&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition%20in%20buddhism&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 December 2014 |page=81|publisher=El paso trust |location=Texas |isbn= 1-934255-97-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
In Islam there are various scholars with varied interpretation of intuition (often termed as hads ([[Arabic]]: حدس), hitting correctly on a mark), sometimes relating the ability of having intuitive knowledge to [[prophet]]hood. 
[[Shahab al-Din Yahya ibn Habash Suhrawardi|Siháb al Din-al Suhrawadi]], in his book ''Philosophy Of Illumination'' (ishraq) finds that intuition is a knowledge acquired through illumination and is mystical in nature and also suggests mystical contemplation ([[mushahada]]) on this to bring about correct judgments.&lt;ref name="Islam1"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Lawson |first1=  Todd  |title=Reason and Inspiration in Islam: Theology, Philosophy and Mysticism in Muslim Thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bq9zSbNr8gIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=210–225|publisher=I.B touris co ltd |location=London |isbn=1-85043-470-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Ibn Sīnā]] finds the ability of having intuition as a "prophetic capacity" and terms it as a knowledge obtained without intentionally acquiring it. He finds that regular knowledge is based on imitation while intuitive knowledge as based on intellectual certitude.&lt;ref name="Islam2"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Kalin |first1=  Ibrahim  |title=Knowledge in Later Islamic Philosophy: Mulla Sadra on Existence, Intellect, and Intuition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H6EGwDLio0QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=155–160|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western philosophy===
In the West, intuition does not appear as a separate field of study, and early mention and definition can be traced back to [[Plato]]. In his book ''[[Plato Republic|Republic]]'' he tries to define intuition as a fundamental capacity of human [[reason]] to comprehend the true nature of [[reality]].&lt;ref name="Plato"&gt;{{cite web |title=Plato: Education and the Value of Justice |url=http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/2h.htm |accessdate= |last = Kemerling|first = Garth|date = 12 November 2011|website = Philosophy Pages }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his works ''[[Meno (Plato)|Meno]]'' and ''[[Phaedo (Plato)|Phaedo]]'', he describes intuition as a pre-existing knowledge residing in the "soul of eternity," and a phenomenon by which one becomes conscious of pre-existing knowledge. He provides an example of mathematical truths, and posits that they are not arrived at by reason. He argues that these truths are accessed using a knowledge already present in a dormant form and accessible to our intuitive capacity. This concept by Plato is also sometimes referred to as [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]. The study was later continued by his [[Neo-platonism|followers]].&lt;ref name="Meno"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klein |first1= Jacob |title=A Commentary on Plato's Meno|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Commentary_on_Plato_s_Meno.html?id=HXI2lcrSsxIC&amp;redir_esc=y |accessdate=22 December 2014 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-43959-3 |pages=103–127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', [[René Descartes|Descartes]] refers to an intuition as a pre-existing knowledge gained through rational reasoning or discovering truth through contemplation. This definition is commonly referred to as [[logical intuition|rational intuition]].&lt;ref name="Descartes"&gt;{{cite book |last1= L. Mursell |first1=James |title=The Philosophical Review  |series=4 |volume=28 |publisher= Duke University Press |location=USA |pages=391–401 |chapter=The Function of Intuition in Descartes' Philosophy of Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later philosophers, such as [[David Hume|Hume]], have more ambiguous interpretations of intuition. Hume claims intuition is a recognition of relationships (relation of time, place, and causation) while he states that "the resemblance" (recognition of relations) "will strike the eye" (which would not require further examination) but goes on to state, "or rather in mind" – attributing intuition to power of mind, contradicting the theory of [[empiricism]].&lt;ref name="hume"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hume|first1=David |title=A Treatise of Human Nature: Being an Attempt to introduce the experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3RIusIRd2q8C|accessdate=23 December 2014  |publisher=The Floating Press  |isbn= 9781775410676|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;{{cite book |last1=  A. Johnson|first1= Oliver|title=The Mind of David Hume: A Companion to Book I of A Treatise of Human Nature |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=fMjhcXhrv48C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=david+hume+on+intuition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lDorBgwuhQ&amp;sig=4X0cOWxYQunqi8k_8rb5R5W8lbA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ai-ZVJy8HcWHPbeQgYAB&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 December 2014  |publisher=The Floating Press |isbn= 0-252-02156-8|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]] finds intuition is thought of as basic sensory information provided by the [[cognitive]] faculty of sensibility (equivalent to what might loosely be called [[perception]]). Kant held that our [[mind]] casts all of our external intuitions in the form of [[space]], and all of our internal intuitions ([[memory]], thought) in the form of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|url= https://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=5144&amp;pageno=35|title= Critique of Pure Reason|publisher= gutenberg.org|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intuitionism]] is a position advanced by [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer]] in [[philosophy of mathematics]] derived from Kant's claim that all [[mathematics|mathematical knowledge]] is knowledge of the pure forms of the intuition – that is, intuition that is not empirical. [[Intuitionistic logic]] was devised by [[Arend Heyting]] to accommodate this position (and has been adopted by other forms of [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]] in general). It is characterized by rejecting the [[law of excluded middle]]: as a consequence it does not in general accept rules such as [[double negation elimination]] and the use of [[reductio ad absurdum]] to prove the existence of something.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Intuitions are customarily appealed to independently of any particular theory of how intuitions provide evidence for claims, and there are divergent accounts of what sort of mental state intuitions are, ranging from mere spontaneous judgment to a special presentation of a necessary truth.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lynch "Trusting Intuitions", in P. Greenough and M. Lynch (ed) ''Truth and Realism'', pp. 227-38.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in recent years a number of philosophers, especially [[George Bealer]] have tried to defend appeals to intuition against [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quinean]] doubts about [[conceptual analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Bealer "Intuition and The Autonomy of Philosophy" in M. Depaul and W. Ramsey (eds) ''Rethinking Intuition: The Psychology of Intuition and Its Role In Philosophical Inquiry'' 1998, pp. 201-239.&lt;/ref&gt; A different challenge to appeals to intuition has recently come from [[experimental philosophy|experimental philosophers]], who argue that appeals to intuition must be informed by the methods of social science.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The [[metaphilosophy|metaphilosophical]] assumption that philosophy depends on intuitions has recently been challenged by some philosophers. [[Timothy Williamson]] has argued that intuition plays no special role in philosophy practice, and that skepticism about intuition cannot be meaningfully separated from a general [[skepticism]] about judgment. On this view, there are no qualitative differences between the methods of philosophy and common sense, the sciences or mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Timothy (2008) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=YN2KGBgKwOcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false The Philosophy of Philosophy]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==

===Freud===
According to Sigmund [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], knowledge could only be attained through the intellectual manipulation of carefully made observations and rejected any other means of acquiring knowledge such as intuition, and his findings could have been an analytic turn of his mind towards the subject.&lt;ref name="Freud"&gt;{{cite book |last1=  Walker Punerr|first1= Helen |title=Sigmund Freud: His Life and Mind |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=386tCTzeb28C&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=intuition+sigmund+freud&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1DqgVLCrJcvfPYeWgLAK&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=28 December 2014  |publisher=Transaction Publishers |pages=197–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jung===
In [[Carl Jung]]'s theory of the [[Human ego|ego]], described in 1916 in ''[[Psychological Types]]'', intuition is an "irrational function", opposed most directly by sensation, and opposed less strongly by the "rational functions" of thinking and feeling. Jung defined intuition as "perception via the unconscious": using sense-perception only as a starting point, to bring forth ideas, images, possibilities, ways out of a blocked situation, by a process that is mostly unconscious.&lt;ref name=ptypes /&gt;

Jung said that a person in whom intuition is dominant, an "intuitive type", acts not on the basis of rational judgment but on sheer intensity of perception. An extraverted intuitive type, "the natural champion of all minorities with a future", orients to new and promising but unproven possibilities, often leaving to chase after a new possibility before old ventures have borne fruit, oblivious to his or her own welfare in the constant pursuit of change. An introverted intuitive type orients by images from the unconscious, ever exploring the psychic world of the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]], seeking to perceive the meaning of events, but often having no interest in playing a role in those events and not seeing any connection between the contents of the psychic world and him- or herself. Jung thought that extraverted intuitive types were likely entrepreneurs, speculators, cultural revolutionaries, often undone by a desire to escape every situation before it becomes settled and constraining—even repeatedly leaving lovers for the sake of new romantic possibilities. His introverted intuitive types were likely mystics, prophets, or cranks, struggling with a tension between protecting their visions from influence by others and making their ideas comprehensible and reasonably persuasive to others—a necessity for those visions to bear real fruit.&lt;ref name=ptypes&gt;C.G. Jung. ''Psychological Types''. Bollingen Series XX, Volume 6, Princeton University Press, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern psychology===
In more-recent psychology, intuition can encompass the ability to know valid solutions to problems and [[decision making]]. For example, the [[recognition primed decision]] (RPD) model explains how people can make relatively fast decisions without having to compare options. [[Gary A. Klein|Gary Klein]] found that under time pressure, high stakes, and changing parameters, experts used their base of experience to identify similar situations and intuitively choose feasible solutions. Thus, the RPD model is a blend of intuition and analysis. The intuition is the pattern-matching process that quickly suggests feasible courses of action. The [[analysis]] is the mental simulation, a conscious and deliberate review of the courses of action.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Gary. ''Intuition At Work''. Random House, NY, NY. January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Instinct]] is often misinterpreted as intuition and its reliability considered to be dependent on past knowledge and occurrences in a specific area. For example, someone who has had more experiences with children will tend to have a better instinct about what they should do in certain situations with them. This is not to say that one with a great amount of experience is always going to have an accurate intuition.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Sadler-Smith. Inside Intuition. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intuitive abilities were quantitatively tested at Yale University in the 1970s. While studying [[nonverbal communication]], researchers noted that some subjects were able to read nonverbal facial cues before reinforcement occurred.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini, J Daood, MC Giannini, R Boniface, PG Rhodes. Intellect versus intuition--dichotomy in the reception of nonverbal communication.Journal of General Psychology. 99:19-24,1978.&lt;/ref&gt; In employing a similar design, they noted that highly intuitive subjects made decisions quickly but could not identify their rationale. Their level of accuracy, however, did not differ from that of non intuitive subjects.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini, ME Barringer, MC Giannini, RH Loiselle. Lack of relationship between handedness and intuitive and intellectual (rationalistic) modes of information processing. Journal of General Psychology. 111:31-37 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intuition, as a gut feeling based on experience, has been found to be useful for business leaders for making judgement about people, culture and strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epubs.scu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&amp;context=gcm_pubs|title=Australian Elite Leaders, Intuition and Effectiveness |publisher=epubs.scu.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement officers often claim to observe suspects and immediately "know" that they possess a weapon or illicit narcotic substances, which could also be action of [[instinct]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/concept-creep/477939/|title=Why Americans Are So Sensitive to Harm|first=Conor|last=Friedersdorf|date=|website=theatlantic.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often unable to articulate why they reacted or what prompted them at the time of the event, they sometimes retrospectively can plot their actions based upon what had been clear and present danger signals. Such examples liken intuition to "[[Feeling#Stomach feeling|gut feelings]]" and when viable illustrate [[preconscious]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. Pinizzotto, PhD, Edward F. Davis, MA, and Charles E. Miller III [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Emotional%2Frational+decision+making+in+law+enforcement-a0114370262 Emotional/rational decision making in law enforcement] (Federal Bureau of Investigation), ''Free Online Library'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==

===JEA.org===
JEA.org was established April 19, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/jea.org Traffic Details from Alexa] at [[Alexa.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===JEADigitalmedia.org===
This website is a source of information, tips and teaching insights for online, multimedia and broadcast journalism.  It is a branch of the Digital Media committee that was formed to address the growing need to support "convergence" of multiple forms of journalism, particularly the move toward online publications.

==Study==
In 1987, the Journalism Education Association's "Committee on the Role of Journalism in Secondary Education" published "High School Journalism Confronts Critical Deadline,"  a 138-page journalism research report.  The research indicated that recipients of secondary [[journalism education]] are more academically successful.  The article cites high school grades, college grades, and [[American College Testing]] scores as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/1c/76/e2.pdf High School Journalism Confronts Critical Deadline]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at [[Education Resources Information Center|ERIC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Amendment advocacy==
The Journalism Education Association released an official statement regarding the practice of [[prior review]] of a school publication on April 16, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jea.org/home/about-jea/statements/ Statements] at JEA.org&lt;/ref&gt;  The statement says: "Prior review by administrators undermines critical thinking, encourages students to dismiss the role of a [[Freedom of the press|free press]] in society and provides no greater likelihood of increased quality of [[student newspaper|student media]]."

'''Julie Velten Favre''' (November 15, 1833 – c. 1896), sometimes called '''Madame Jules Favre''', was a [[France|French]] philosopher and educator. She is known for her work educating young women and for advancing a moral philosophy that advocated living a virtuous life, rather than one based on rules and punishment.&lt;ref name="waithe"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4eHUBgAAQBAJ |title=A History of Women Philosophers: Modern Women Philosophers, 1600–1900 |publisher=Springer |year=2012 |isbn=9789401137904 |editor-last=Waithe |editor-first=M.E. |editor-link=Mary Ellen Waithe |volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bales"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PbyDl_k7x7AC |title=Philosophy in the West: Men, Women, Religion, Science |last=Bales |first=Eugene F. |publisher=Xlibris |year=2008 |isbn=9781462805235 |pages=495–496}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Favre was born '''Caroline Julie Émilie Velten''' in [[Wissembourg]] in the north-eastern part of France to Michel Velten and Caroline Louise Weber. Her father was a [[Lutheran]] minister.&lt;ref name="Bas-Rhin"&gt;Archives du Bas-Rhin, État-civil de Wissembourg&lt;/ref&gt; As a child she disagreed with the imposition of religious practices and was greatly affected by the [[French Revolution of 1848]], which happened when she was thirteen years old. Velten grew to believe strongly in freedom and self-determination.&lt;ref name="waithe" /&gt;

==Professional life==
Not long after completing her teaching degree in Wissembourg, Velten became head assistant of a boarding school in [[Paris]]. Run by a Mme. Frèrejean, this [[Protestant]] school emphasized the personal will and good mental habits over strict punishment or rigid oversight. Velten was highly influenced by this educational approach.&lt;ref name="waithe" /&gt; After Frèrejean's death in 1860, Velten became director of the school.&lt;ref name="waithe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="margadant"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Madame le professeur: Women Educators in the Third Republic |last=Margadant |first=Jo Burr |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1990 |isbn=9780691008646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, the [[Franco-Prussian War]] broke out and northeastern France was occupied by German forces. Velten stayed at the school with students who were unable to leave.&lt;ref name="waithe" /&gt;

[[Image:Jules Favre.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Portrait of Jules Favre.]]
Velten married [[Jules Favre]], a public official who was active in the [[French Third Republic]], in 1871. The couple traveled often, and Velten Favre used this time to translate various German and Swiss books into French.&lt;ref name="waithe" /&gt; She also was an intellectual equal of her husband and contributed to his works. In the preface of one of his books, he said of her, "Her name ought to be beside mine on all the works to which over the last four years she has so faithfully contributed and for which I found, in her mind and heart, the surest guide."&lt;ref name="margadant" /&gt;

Jules Favre died in January 1880, and in the following years she compiled, edited and completed his works into several volumes.&lt;ref name="waithe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="margadant" /&gt; In 1883 she wrote a defense of her husband's career, which some at the time viewed in a negative light.&lt;ref name="Wetzel"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e601yCfJvo0C |title=A Duel of Nations: Germany, France, and the Diplomacy of the War of 1870-1871 |last=Wetzel |first=David |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |year=2012 |isbn=9780299291334 |pages=286 |author-link=David Wetzel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881, [[Jules Ferry]], the French [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Minister of National Education]], named Velten Favre director of the [[École normale supérieure de jeunes filles|Ècole Normale Supérieure de Sèvres]].&lt;ref name="Long"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1APAE0XKGYwC |title=Religious Differences in France: Past and Present |publisher=Truman State University Press |year=2006 |isbn=9781931112574 |editor-last=Long |editor-first=Kathleen P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferry was a champion of secular public education, and Velten Favre was well suited to lead the movement for French women to receive secondary education, despite a skeptical public.&lt;ref name="waithe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bales" /&gt; Velten Favre continued to teach at the school until she died in 1896.&lt;ref name="waithe" /&gt;

==Philosophy==
As an educator, Velten Favre frequently pulled excerpts from classical and modern philosophers such as [[Aristotle]], the [[Stoics]], [[Plato]], [[Socrates]], [[Molière]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] for her students to read and discuss.&lt;ref name="waithe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bales" /&gt; Her own works grew from this educational background and were mainly written in the 1880s. She believed in [[moral universalism|universal morality]], encouraging her students to live educated, moral lives. Personally she considered moral law to have foundations in the [[Christianity|Christian]] perspective, but she also wrote that moral truth could be found outside of Christianity.&lt;ref name="Bales" /&gt;

In particular, Velten Favre wrote that one is first a moral citizen, and only secondarily is a member of a country or family. This places men and women as equals. Velten Favre believed that women had a particular vocation to teach morality, which necessitates that women receive a broad and complete education.&lt;ref name="Bales" /&gt;

== Career ==
Taylor attended college at a small Jesuit school in Wisconsin, during which she spent a year as an [[National Basketball Association Cheerleading|NBA dancer]] with the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] which went to the [[2000–01_Milwaukee_Bucks_season|East conference finals]].&lt;ref name="business insider" /&gt;&lt;ref name="journal star" /&gt; She then transferred to [[Arizona State University]] to study journalism, during which she covered football games for ''[[The Arizona Republic]]''. She graduated from Arizona State in 2005 with a Bachelor of Arts,&lt;ref name="linkedin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="geekwire" /&gt; and continued working with ''The Arizona Republic''.&lt;ref name="business insider" /&gt;

In 2008, she was working with an online publisher in Chicago but started having interests in online education.&lt;ref name="business insider" /&gt;  In 2012, she joined the cast of entrepreneurs in the reality television series ''[[Start-Ups: Silicon Valley]]'' where she worked as an account manager and head of sales for Ampush Media. &lt;ref name="ampush" /&gt;  During the series, she quit Ampush and created a startup business called Shonova which focused on the fashion industry.&lt;ref name="mercury" /&gt; However, Shonova lasted a few weeks before she gave that up.&lt;ref name="business insider" /&gt;

In June 2013, Taylor joined Kaplan EdTech Accelerator, a partnership between [[Kaplan, Inc.]] and [[Techstars]] which hosts, mentors, and funds startup companies in education technology and product innovation for a three-month program in New York City.&lt;ref name="techstars"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/kim-taylor-in-techstars-education-class-2013-6 |title=Reality TV Star Kim Taylor Has A New Startup, And It Got Her Into A Top-Notch Accelerator Program |last=Dickey |first=Megan Rose |date=June 18, 2013 |website=[[Business Insider]] |access-date=October 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crains"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.crainsnewyork.com/assets/pdf/CN9346438.PDF | format=PDF | journal=[[Crain's New York Business]] | volume=30 | number=10 | title=Accelerator's Equity Grab &amp;ndash; Pick the Right Platform | first=Judith | last=Messina | publication-date=March 10, 2014 | page=16 }} &lt;/ref&gt; As part of joining EdTech, she co-founded with childhood friend Cecilia Retelle the online degree company Ranku and served as the Chief Executive Officer.&lt;ref name="ftc ranku" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes staid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="business insider june 2013" /&gt; She named it after the Japanese rending of the phrase rank.

'''Kitchener School of Medicine,''' located in [[Khartoum]], [[Sudan]], was opened in the year 1924 by Sir [[Lee Stack]], Governor General of Sudan and [[Sirdar]] (General) of the Egyptian army in memory of [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord H. Kitchener]], the Governor General of [[Sudan]] from the year 1898 to 1900.&lt;ref Name =meduofk.net&gt;[http://www.meduofk.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=2 Faculty History] Faculty of Medicine University of Khartoum, Retrieved 21 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  It was founded with funds raised from the public, mostly from the United Kingdom.  Yearly running costs were financed by endowments and by Sudan government subsidies.
&lt;ref name = Almanac1949&gt;{{cite book |title=Sudan Almanac 1949|year=1949|publisher=Sudan Government and McCorquodale &amp; Co. (Sudan) Ltd.|location= Khartoum, Sudan|others=Compiled in the Public Relations Office, Civil Secretary's Department, Khartoum.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The initial intake of students in 1924 was seven.&lt;ref name = Almanac1949/&gt;

Students transferred from the [[Gordon Memorial College]] School of Science to the Kitchener School and studied for six years (after 1939 - before that it had been four years&lt;ref name = meduofk.net/&gt;) before taking their final examinations.  The school's diploma was recognised by the [[Royal College of Physicians]] of London, UK and the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] of England, UK.&lt;ref name = Almanac1949/&gt;

Kitchener School of Medicine joined Khartoum University College in September of the year 1951. After the Independence in 1956, the University College became the [[University of Khartoum]], the Kitchener School of Medicine became the Faculty of Medicine and students started graduating with an [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|M.B.B.S.]] degree. In 2012 the annual intake of new students into the Faculty of Medicine was about 350 and there were about 201 full-time staff plus many part-time staff.&lt;ref name = Almanac1949/&gt;

The Faculty of Medicine offers both post-graduate and under-graduate studies.

'''Little Angels' School''' is a private school system based in Hattiban, [[Lalitpur District, Nepal|Lalitpur District]] of [[Nepal]], [[Kathmandu]]. The school offers A-Levels and +2 facilities and education up to the SEE. The school's motto is "One goal, one mission. Our children, our nation."

==Description and history==
Little Angels' School (LAS) has a primary wing at Jhamsikhel. The main Hattiban campus offers education up to high school but also includes post-secondary levels. In 2066 BS, LAS began offering the internationally recognized [[General Certificate of Education]] classes - Cambridge A Level. Thus, LAS allows the students to compete with international educational standards. It is strictly English medium and is considered one of the best and most elite schools of Nepal, including the most beautiful campus. The school teaches more than 4,600 students. Including [[GCE Advanced Level|A-Level]] students, Little Angels College, and Little Angels College of Management, total enrollment is about 6,400 students and just above 700 teachers/lecturers are employed.&lt;ref name="KAN"&gt;[http://www.kantipuronline.com/kolnews.php?&amp;nid=103430 Kantipur Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424055426/http://www.kantipuronline.com/kolnews.php?&amp;nid=103430|date=24 April 2008}}. Kantipuronline.com. Retrieved on 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Little Angels School was started in 1981 with the aim of "providing good quality education to the students". Both the founder principals were in the field of education long before LAS was born—one in administration, the other in teaching. The founders - Mrs. Bidhya Limbu and Mr. Umesh Shrestha now act as founder directors while responsibilities of a principal are handled by Mr. Mukunda Raj Sharma. Umesh Shrestha holds an M.A. in School Management.&lt;ref name="nepalnews1"&gt;[http://www.nepalnews.com/contents/2008/englishmonthly/businessage/sep/personality.php Nepal News Interview]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school uses about 120 buses to transport almost 8,000 students each school day.
The school premise includes four basketball courts, a football ground, two lawn tennis courts, two volleyball courts and spacious playground in each block.

Little Angels' School is a member of the Private and Boarding Schools Organization of Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepal-schools.com/pabson.htm PABSON]. Nepal-schools.com. Retrieved on 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Section divisions===
In 2016, Little Angels' School adapted a new policy for section division. Previously, the school had section names of an alphabet (A,B,C, and so on) followed by a number (1,2; and 3 for hostel students up to Grade 8). An example would be 9 A2, 9 being the grade and A2 the section name. The 'A' alphabet denotes the elite students of the school, and other sections follow suit as B1/B2, C1/C2 and so on.

From 2016 henceforth, the 10th grade students are categorized randomly into sections instead of on merit basis. The section numbers are up to 4 instead of 2 (e.g. 10 A4). Similarly, in lower classes, the sections have been expanded up to the number

'''Florian Max Hardberger''' (born November 19, 1948)&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2424117/bio ''Internet Movie Database'' – Max Hardberger]&lt;/ref&gt; is an American adventurer, [[Captain (nautical)|ship captain]], [[aviator]], ship recovery specialist, [[admiralty law]]yer and author of [[Sea story|maritime fiction]] and non-fiction adventures.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

== Education ==
Hardberger received his high school degree in 1966 from the [[Castle Heights Military Academy]] in Lebanon, Tennessee.  He became a [[Private Pilot License|licensed aircraft pilot]] at the age of 16 while at Castle Heights.&lt;ref name="UNO"&gt;Rivault, Mike, [http://www.maxhardberger.com/pdf/UNO_Alumni_Magazine_Fall_2007.pdf "Freighter Repo Man"], ''University of New Orleans Alumni Magazine'', Fall 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Hardberger attended college at [[Nicholls State|Nicholls State University]] in Thibodaux, Louisiana then transferred to the [[University of New Orleans]] for another two years of study.&lt;ref name="UNO"/&gt; In 1969 he graduated early with a BA in English.&lt;ref name="UNO"/&gt; During college, Hardberger became a [[Scuba diving|SCUBA diver]], skilled sailor and [[Navigation|navigator]].  After college, Hardberger attended the Program in Creative Writing at the [[University of Iowa]] (commonly known as the "[[Iowa Writer's Workshop|Iowa Writers' Workshop]]"), where in 1972 he received a [[Master of Fine Arts]] degree in Fiction and Poetry.&lt;ref name="Iowa"&gt;Schoon, Amy, [http://www.maxhardberger.com/pdf/Iowa_Alumni_Magazine_Feb_2008.pdf "The Good Pirate"], ''University of Iowa Alumni Magazine'', February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1998, Hardberger earned a ''Juris Doctor'' degree from [[Northwestern California University School of Law]] in Sacramento, California, and was admitted to the [[State Bar of California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwculaw.edu/cgi-bin/nwcu/notable_alumni.html ''Northwestern California University School of Law'' – Notable Alumni] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507113710/http://www.nwculaw.edu/cgi-bin/nwcu/notable_alumni.html |date=2010-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary career ==
Hardberger's first book was ''Deadweight: Owning the Ocean Freighter'' (1994),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikireadia.org/search-books-by-isbn.php?searchstr=0964043300&amp;searchby=ISBN&amp;action=Search WikiReadia – ''Deadweight:  Owning the Ocean Freighter'']&lt;/ref&gt; a textbook on ship ownership.  He followed ''Deadweight'' with his first novel, ''Freighter Captain'' (1998),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikireadia.org/search-books-by-isbn.php?searchstr=0964043378&amp;searchby=ISBN&amp;action=Search WikiReadia – ''Freighter Captain'']&lt;/ref&gt; a semi-autobiographical account of his adventures as a ship captain in the Caribbean. Hardberger then moved from maritime subjects to a [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]] with his 1999 novel, ''The Jumping-Off Place,''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikireadia.org/search-books-by-isbn.php?searchstr=096404336X&amp;searchby=ISBN&amp;action=Search WikiReadia – ''The Jumping-Off Place'']&lt;/ref&gt; which was a tribute to the [[hardboiled]] detective novels of [[Raymond Chandler]] and [[Dashiell Hammett]]. On April 6, 2010, Hardberger's auto-biography about his ship recovery adventures was published by the [[Broadway Books]] imprint of [[Random House]], entitled ''SEIZED! A Sea Captain's Adventures Battling Scoundrels and Pirates While Recovering Stolen Ships in the World's Most Troubled Waters.''&lt;ref name="Seized"&gt;Hardberger, Max, [http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780767931380&amp;ref=rec&amp;name=search ''Seized:  A Sea Captain's Adventures Battling Scoundrels and Pirates While Recovering Stolen Ships in the World's Most Troubled Waters''], Broadway Books, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  A paperback edition of SEIZED for the [[British Commonwealth]] market will be released by Nicholas Brealey Publishing on June 24, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nicholasbrealey.com/uk/pc/viewPrd.asp?idcategory=93&amp;idproduct=278 Nicholas Brealey Publishing Website – ''Seized'' Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a devotee of the [[hardboiled]] school of fiction, Hardberger's writing style offers gritty realism. Like his life, many of Hardberger's books are set in the seedy world of international business. His protagonists are often like himself, savvy, sardonic, and capable of violent action, and his villains are drawn from the panoply of miscreants he's met as a ship captain and maritime lawyer. Hardberger's stories are fact-based, real-world adventures from the underbelly of world commerce.

==Professional career==

===Teaching English and playing music – 1969 to 1976===
After college, Hardberger started his professional career with a short stint teaching English at [[Mandeville High School]] in Louisiana.&lt;ref name="UNO"/&gt;  Hardberger then worked as a newspaper reporter for the Houma Daily Guide in [[Houma, Louisiana]].  He left the newspaper to explore Mexico in an old school bus before returning to the United States to attend graduate school.  After he received his [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA degree]] in 1972, Hardberger taught English at All Saints Episcopal School in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]].  He left teaching to work as a drummer in various [[blues]] bands on the [[Chitlin Circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;''Seized'' (2010), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oilfield worker and pilot – 1977 to 1985===

In 1977, Hardberger returned home to Louisiana to work as a deckhand and then as a mate on the [[Platform supply vessel|oilfield supply vessel]] ''Magcobar Mercury'' in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref name="Seized"/&gt;  After he earned a captain's license, Hardberger's employer sent him to the Dresser-Magcobar Drilling Fluids School in Houston to learn how to become a [[Mud engineer|drilling fluids engineer]], also known as a "mud man."  Hardberger initially worked in oilfields off the Louisiana and Mississippi [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] and then worked as a [[Mud engineer|drilling fluids consultant]] in Guatemala during the [[Guatemalan Civil War]].  Between oilfield hitches, Hardberger continued his flying lessons, earning [[Commercial Pilot License|commercial]] and [[flight instructor]] licenses, and took a wide variety of flying jobs, including towing banners, [[crop dusting|dusting crops]], doing nightly check runs for banks and transporting dead bodies for mortuaries.&lt;ref name="UNO"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Seized'' (2010), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  Hardberger also delivered aircraft to Central America.  
Hardberger returned to the classroom for the 1984–85 school year, when he taught English and world history at [[Pope John Paul II High School (Slidell, Louisiana)]].&lt;ref&gt;''Seized'' (2010), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;  Hardberger briefly returned to the oilfields of Guatemala in 1985, then began [[crop dusting]] on a full-time basis in [[Breaux Bridge]], Louisiana.  At the end of the 1986 [[crop dusting]] season, Hardberger traveled to Miami, Florida to search for new work.&lt;ref name="UNO"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Seized'' (2010), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ship captain – 1986 to 1990===

When [[Jean-Claude Duvalier|Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier]] was overthrown as the ruler of Haiti in 1986, trade opened up between the United States and Haiti.&lt;ref name="UNO"/&gt;  The [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]] was the loading port for many small freighters in the Haitian trade.  After Hardberger left [[crop dusting]], he searched for and soon found work on the [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]] as the captain of a small freighter engaged in that trade.&lt;ref name="UNO"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Seized'' (2010), p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his commands was the ''Erika'', a small freighter which transported cargoes throughout the Caribbean.  Hardberger's voyages on the ''Erika'' were the basis of his 1998 semi-autobiographical novel, ''Freighter Captain''.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;Weikel, Dan, [http://www.maxhardberger.com/pdf/Los_Angeles_Times_March_1_2007.pdf "He's His Own Port Authority"], ''Los Angeles Times'', March 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recovering vessels – 1990 to present===

Hardberger left the ''Erika'' to work for a Miami-based ship owner, MorganPrice &amp; Co.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morganpriceco.com/HomeEnglish.htm MorganPrice &amp; Co. Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309013333/http://www.morganpriceco.com/HomeEnglish.htm |date=2010-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as port captain responsible for overseeing port calls by the company's ships.&lt;ref name="UNO"/&gt;  During this period, a MorganPrice freighter, the ''Patric M'', was seized by a shipper in [[Puerto Cabello]], Venezuela.  This action required Hardberger to sail the vessel out of port under the cover of night and without a clearance, in violation of Venezuelan law.&lt;ref&gt;Author Unknown, [http://www.maxhardberger.com/pdf/Florida_Shipper_Magazine_July_1990.pdf "Commando Action Saves Ship"], ''Florida Shipper Magazine'', July 16, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  This operation was Hardberger's first vessel "extraction" and is detailed in his autobiography, ''Seized''.&lt;ref&gt;''Seized'' (2010), pp. 15–61&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardberger left MorganPrice in 1990 to form his own marine consultancy business in Louisiana.  He was periodically retained by shipowners to extract their vessels from lawless ports without a clearance from local authorities.  In 1998, following his admission to the California Bar, Hardberger began to practice maritime law alongside his marine consultancy and vessel extraction business.  In 2002, Hardberger formed the ship repossession company Vessel Extractions, LLC ("VessEx") to extract vessels that have been illegitimately detained or seized in foreign countries.  In 2004, Hardberger was featured in [[The Learning Channel]] series, ''Repo Men:  Stealing for a Living'', in a segment entitled "Repo Adventurer,"documenting his extraction of a 10,000-ton freighter from Haiti during the [[2004 Haiti rebellion|2004 rebellion]] and his delivery of the vessel to her mortgagee in the Bahamas.&lt;ref name="Fairplay"&gt;Watson, Will, [http://www.maxhardberger.com/pdf/Fairplay_Magazine_April_26_2007.pdf "Just What the Witch Doctor Ordered"], ''Fairplay International Shipping Weekly'', April 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Medieval Chronicle Society''' is an international and interdisciplinary organization founded to facilitate the work of scholars interested in medieval [[annals]] and [[chronicle]]s, or more generally medieval [[historiography]].&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht Classen, ''Handbook of Medieval Studies'', 2010, p.1719.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For press reports on the Society see for example ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagzeitung'', 22 May 2011, p.63.&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1999 and in February 2011 had 380 members.

==Aims and history==
Annals and chronicles were the main genres of historical writing in the [[Middle Ages]]. Consequently, they have always been of great importance to [[historians]].  The extent to which they are also of interest to students of [[medieval literature]] or of [[historical linguistics]] was only fully realised in the latter part of the 20th century.  Since many chronicles are illustrated, they are also a fruitful object of study for [[art history|art historians]].  It was the desire for a forum in which these disciplines could operate together that led to the foundation of the society.

The history of the society began with a series of triennial conferences initially in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], but later moving from place to place.  These early conferences were hosted by Erik Kooper (English studies, Utrecht).  It was at the second of these conferences, in 1999, that the society was formally founded.

The society maintains a website financed by the University of Liverpool, and publishes a regular newsletter with information on recent publications in the chronicles field.

==Journal ''The Medieval Chronicle''==
[[File:MedievalChronicle4.jpg|150px|right|The journal ''The Medieval Chronicle'']]
Volumes of proceedings of the first three conferences were published by Rodopi.&lt;ref&gt;''The Medieval Chronicle'' volumes 1–3, [[Rodopi (publisher)|Rodopi]], 1999–2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the society was founded, this triennial publication was transformed into a yearbook, now the peer-reviewed journal ''The Medieval Chronicle''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Medieval Chronicle'' volumes 4– , [[Rodopi (publisher)|Rodopi]], 2006– , ISSN 1567-2336.&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal is trilingual, with articles in English, French and German. As well as the proceedings of the society's conferences, and also of the Cambridge Chronicle Symposium, the journal includes research submitted independently of the conferences. A number of text editions of chronicles have also been published here.

The ''EMC'' contains around 2500 usually quite short articles on individual authors or on anonymous works. A majority of these are from Western Christendom, but there are also entries on Slavic, Byzantine, Syriac, Islamic and Jewish chronicles. These give information on the date, language, form and manuscript tradition, and discuss issues which have been highlighted in recent scholarship. There are also about 60 longer "thematic" articles on particular aspects of chronicles. The two-volume paper edition appeared in 2010 and runs to around 1830 pages, with about 60 black-and-white full-page illustrations. About 450 scholars collaborated in writing it. An electronic edition with additional articles appeared in 2012; an update with significant expansions appeared in 2016.

'''Marie-Antoinette Willemsen''' called '''Meyrianne Héglon''' (21 June 1867 – 11 January 1942) was a Belgian lyric artist of Danish origin. After her marriage to the composer [[Xavier Leroux]], she was known as Madame '''Héglon-Leroux'''.

== Life ==
Born in Brussels, Héglon studied with [[Marie Sax]] and Barthot, Tequi and [[Louis-Henri Obin]] and continued her studies with [[Rosine Laborde]].&lt;ref name="SOPER"&gt;{{en icon}} Richard T. Soper, ''Belgian Opera Houses and Singers'' (Reprint Company 1999), p.265-266. {{ISBN|9780871525161}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made her debut at the [[Paris Opera]] in November 1890, as Maddalena in ''[[Rigoletto]]''.

She sang at [[La Monnaie]] in 1894-1895 and later in 1901-1902. She performed as a guest artist in [[Ghent]] in 1898-1899.

Héglon, frequently appeared at the [[Paris Opera]] from 1897 to 1907. On April 7, 1898 at the Paris Opera, she sang at the world premiere of ''[[Quattro pezzi sacri|Tre pezzi sacri]]''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;at the time composed of three parts&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Verdi]], with her and [[Marie Delna]] as [[mezzo-soprano]]s and Aino Acté and [[Louise Grandjean]] as [[soprano]]s, as part of the concerts of the [[Orchestre de la Société des concerts du Conservatoire]], conducted by [[Paul Taffanel]]. She sang the role of Omphale in the première of Leroux's ''[[Astarté (opera)|Astarté]]'' in 1901&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|language= fr|author1=[[Paul Milliet]]|title=Première représentation d'Astarté|journal=Le Monde artiste|volume=|issue=7|date=17 February 1901|pages=2|issn=|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5454043b/f10.image|accessdate= 16 November 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Louise Grandjean]], Albert Alvarez, [[Francisque Delmas]].&lt;ref name="LYRICA"&gt;{{Cite news|language= fr|author1=Szifer|title=La mort de Mlle Louise Grandjean|journal=Lyrica|volume=|issue=2540|date= May 1934|pages=|issn=|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5410879c/f4.item.r=%22Louise%20Grandjean%22|accessdate= 16 November 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Héglon spent a large part of her career at the [[Opéra de Monte-Carlo]]. On October 4, 1898, she signed a contract for three performances of ''Amneris'', in Italian and four for the premiere of the title role of Isidore de Lara's ''[[Messaline]]''. Héglon received considerable support from [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] and sang in his ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Delilah]]'' in 1904.&lt;ref name="SOPER"/&gt;

She appeared in 1898 in the role of Anne Boleyn in ''[[Henry VIII (opera)|Henry VIII]]'' at [[Covent Garden]] where she performed on July 13, 1899 in the title role of ''Messaline'' with Albert Alvarez in the role of Helion and [[Maurice Renaud]] in that of Harès. She also sang in the main operas of Belgium, ''[[Rigoletto (opera)|Rigoletto]]'' in 1904 at the Théâtre Royal [[Antwerp]]. At the [[Opéra-Comique]], she created the role of La Vougne in [[Alexandre Georges]]' ''Miarka'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.bnf.fr/14817098/alexandre_georges_miarka/ ''Miarka''] on [[BnF]]&lt;/ref&gt; on November 7, 1905 and also did this premiere in London.

After her retirement from the stage, she taught singing and among her most notable students was the French soprano [[Ninon Vallin]].

On April 8, 1917, her husband Xavier Leroux directed his work ''[[Les cadeaux de Noël]]''. The participating artists, Monin, Stura, Vellini and Coste, were all students of Héglon. On April 6, 1918, another work by her husband was performed, ''1814''. For this performance, she came out of retirement to sing the role of The Mother.&lt;ref name="SOPER"/&gt;

She has made four rare recordings fo [[Gramophone Company]] in 1904. Her voice can be heard on the anthology album 
''[[The Record of Singing#The Record of Singing Volume 1 (1899–1919)|The Record of Singing Volume I (1899-1919)]]''.

The '''New Partnership for Africa's Development E-School Programme''' run by [[NEPAD]] aims to provide computers and internet access to all schools in [[Africa]] within 10 years, and also to set up health points to tie in with Nepad's [[E-Health]] program. 

The project was launched in 2003 at the [[African Economic Summit]] in [[Durban]]. The aim is to cover all high schools within 5 years of the start of implementation and all primary schools within 10 years, a total of some 600,000 schools. 

In June, 2005, at the [[World Economic Forum|World Economic Forum Africa Summit]] in [[Cape Town]], it was announced that the first school to benefit from the program would be [[Bugulumbya Secondary School]] in the village of [[Busobya]], [[Uganda]]. A consortium of companies led by [[Hewlett Packard]] is to equip the school in collaboration with the Ugandan government. 

A demonstration project involving various private companies is planned to take place over 12-18 months in 16 countries including: [[Algeria]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Cameroon]], [[Egypt]], [[Gabon]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Lesotho]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritius]], [[Mozambique]], [[Nigeria]], [[Rwanda]], [[Senegal]], [[South Africa]] and Uganda.

"William Rankin," ''[[Public Understanding of Science]]'' reviewer Patrick Fullick confirms, "sets out to illuminate the man whose work laid the foundations of the physics of the last 350 years, and to place him and his work in the context of the times in which he lived."&lt;ref name="PUS01"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fullick |first=Patrick |date=1995 |title=Educating the new Aristotelians |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1088/0963-6625/4/1/006 |journal=[[Public Understanding of Science]] |volume=4 |issue= |pages=77-84 |doi= |access-date=2017-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New Scientist]]'' reviewer Roy Herbert adds that, "alongside theories of the Universe from ancient times, the book explains those originating since Isaac Newton, so placing him deftly in his scientific context."&lt;ref name="NS01"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Herbert |first=Roy |date=24 July 1993 |title=Paperbacks – Roy Herbert weighs up the lives of Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Isaac Newton, looks at left-handedness, sheep slayers and near death experiences, and ponders the mystery of speech |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13918835-100/ |journal=[[New Scientist]] |volume= |issue=1883 |pages= |doi= |access-date=2017-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
"This book shares the general characteristics of the ''Beginners'' series with a large number of line drawings and cartoons with associated text and many asides," states Patrick Fullick, writing in ''[[Public Understanding of Science]]'', "for some readers the asides may seem idiosyncratic or even annoying." "Some may dislike the humour and bad puns that abound in this work," confirms Bill Palmer, writing in the ''Journal of the Science Teacher Association of the Northern Territory'', "but I suspect that those starting the study of Newton's life and work will appreciate this attempt to facilitate reading."&lt;ref name="STANT01"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Palmer |first=Bill |date=1997 |title=Book review ''Newton for Beginners'' |url= |journal=Journal of the Science Teacher Association of the Northern Territory |volume=16 |issue=160-161 |pages= |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

"The book is well-grounded in recent historiography," and, "Rankin is clearly sympathetic towards his subject," states Fullick, "but inevitably Newton still comes over as one whose intellectual vanity was at times apt to overcome his self-control."&lt;ref name="PUS01" /&gt; Roy Herbert, writing in ''[[New Scientist]]'', confirms that despite being a colossus, "Many of his contemporaries saw him as something else and these bit players provide a background of 17th-century backbiting and squabbling (Newton took part) that is always fascinating."&lt;ref name="NS01" /&gt; 

"Newton's story is told accurately and entertainingly,"&lt;ref name="STANT01" /&gt; concludes Palmer. "It combines drawings with text and pulls off the difficult trick of imparting serious information while keeping the reader amused with jokes and irreverent asides," adds Herbert, "it is a technique that has strong appeal and so, even if you have misgivings about it, you are lured along the trail."&lt;ref name="NS01" /&gt; "The communication of the idea that the great scientists of the past had their hopes and fears and that they had concerns other than the purely academic or professional is probably done as well pictorially as by other means,"&lt;ref name="PUS01" /&gt; confirms Fullick. "Easily swallowed and," concludes Herbert, "retainable."&lt;ref name="NS01" /&gt;

'''''Our Rural Magazine''''' was a monthly magazine produced between 1926 and 1946 by the [[Schools of Isolated and Distance Education|WA Correspondence School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.side.wa.edu.au/about/welcome/side-heritage.html|title=Heritage, The SIDE Story|publisher=Schools of Isolated and Distance Education WA|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Education Department of Western Australia]] for school children who were located in isolated circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Western Australia. Education Dept.  1926  Our rural magazine. Vol. 1, no. 1 (1926) - v. 14, no. 11 (1939) for National Library of Australia holdings - [[Battye Library]] has minimal description and claims 1946 as final year http://henrietta.liswa.wa.gov.au/record=b1845381~S2&lt;/ref&gt;  In the inter-war period, many isolated rural localities did not have primary schools, and the students were required to have their education by correspondence.

The magazine was based in Perth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our rural magazine|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/12937894?selectedversion=NBD5433786|work=National Library of Australia|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was operated by the Education Department, with writers such as James Pollard&lt;ref&gt;Pollard also was writing school texts in the same era - see - Pollard, James (1936).  In Nature's story book : nature stories at school, in town, and in bushland : a reader for classes III &amp; IV.  E.B. Bayliss Print, Perth, W.A&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John K. Ewers]].&lt;ref&gt;"OUR RURAL MAGAZINE.". (25 March 1931). The West Australian (Perth, WA : 1879-1954), p. 13. Retrieved 16 July 2011, from http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32507277&lt;/ref&gt; Also heads of various institutions wrote on topics related to their position - in the September 1933 edition - the Government Botanist [[C.A.Gardner]] writes, as well as the curator of the Museum [[Ludwig Glauert]] conducts a correspondence column.&lt;ref&gt;"OUR RURAL MAGAZINE.". (2 October 1933). The West Australian (Perth, WA : 1879-1954), p. 14. Retrieved 16 July 2011, from http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article33327846&lt;/ref&gt;

Also senior community leaders made encouraging messages to the isolated students like Field Marshal [[Sir William Birdwood]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt; I earnestly advise you to take full advantage of the educational correspondence classes that are open to you and by which my two grand-daughters have started their education.  Be guided by the help and valuable instruction to be derived from 'Our Rural Magazine' and do not forget that the country districts, handicapped as their people may be in many respects, have been responsible for many of the most able leaders in the public life of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;"OUR RURAL MAGAZINE.". (18 October 1934). The West Australian (Perth, WA : 1879-1954), p. 14. Retrieved 16 July 2011, from http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32812573&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4518">The '''Polytechnic''' ([[Greek language|Greek:]] Πολυτεχνείο) is the traditional name for institutions of higher [[education in Greece]], dealing with [[engineering]] at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. There are currently two polytechnics that operate as independent (public) [[universities]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://web.uni-marburg.de/eurostudies/studienreform/eaie_cd/ACE_CoE_CD_2005/acebook/NARIC_guide.pdf NARIC guide on Higher Education Systems in the European Union,Edition of 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209072945/http://web.uni-marburg.de/eurostudies/studienreform/eaie_cd/ACE_CoE_CD_2005/acebook/NARIC_guide.pdf |date=2008-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and five polytechnic schools that belong to universities. They consist mainly of [[Engineering]] [[Academic department|department]]s and their undergraduate programs have a duration of 5 years (full-time). The legal framework of their operation is the same as the one of the universities, and their graduates have equal rights with the graduates of public Greek universities{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}&lt;br /&gt; Greek polytechnics are also referred to as ''Technical Universities''.

==History==
PrepClass was founded on May 1, 2013 in Lagos, Nigeria by two friends, namely Chukwuwezam Obanor and Olumide Ogunlana both graduates of the [[University of Lagos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Atoke | first = | title =BN Making It!: ‘Wezam &amp; Olumide of PrepClass Are Changing the Face of Nigerian Education as You Know It| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''bellanaija.com''| date =31 May 2016 | url =https://www.bellanaija.com/2016/05/bn-making-it-wezam-olumide-of-prepclass-are-changing-the-face-of-nigerian-education-as-you-know-it/ | accessdate =15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was developed when the [[Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board]] (JAMB) in [[Nigeria]] announced the birth of computer-based tests. The two friends  saw an avenue to help students and learners prepare for tests and examinations online and thus, created a ‘test prep’ platform to help change, shape and improve the educational system in the country. This attempt later developed  and led the creation of PrepClass&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Julia | first =Reynolds-Cuellar | title =Successful MIT Global Startup Labs alum visits campus| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''news.mit.edu''| date =29 August 2014 | url =http://news.mit.edu/2014/mit-global-startup-labs-invites-back-alum/ | accessdate =15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, an App called ''Prep-test'' was developed by the PrepClass team. It provides tutors with a platform where they are able to create and upload contents as text, image, audio-visuals (videos).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Ifeanyi | first =Ndiomewese | title =PrepClass is addressing Nigeria’s educational issues one student-tutor relationship at a time| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''techpoint.ng''| date =19 June 2017 | url =https://techpoint.ng/2017/06/19/prepclass-solve-nigeria-education/ | accessdate =15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
In February 2014, the co-founders of Prepclass entered and won their first competition which was the ''Techcabal Battlefield''. The company received a $20,000 cash prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =7 TechCabal Battlefield Finalists Emerge to Contest For $20,000| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''bellanaija.com''| date =17 February 2014 | url =https://www.bellanaija.com/2014/02/seven-techcabal-battlefield-finalists-emerge-to-contest-for-20000-finale-holds-on-friday-21st-february-2014/ | accessdate =15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Startup Prepclass Emerges Winner Of Techcabal Battlefield $20,000| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''thebusinessaim.com.ng''| date =29 May 2017| url =http://thebusinessaim.com.ng/startup-prepclass-emerges-winner-of-techcabal-battlefield-20000/ | accessdate =15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The innovation of the firm was also able to attract another $12,500 of equity free funding for emerging as the overall grand prize winner from [[Africa]] in the Indian-Africa competition which held later in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Odunayo | first =Eweniyi | title =PrepClass: Life After The Battlefield | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''techcabal.com''| date =2 July 2014| url =https://techcabal.com/2014/07/02/prepclass-life-after-battlefield/ | accessdate =15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, PrepClass was selected for the GSMA Ecosystem Accelerator Innovation Fund where they were awarded $322,000 grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Winning!

The '''United States Presidential Scholars Program''' is a program of the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]]. It is described as "one of the Nation's highest honors for students" in the [[United States|United States of America]] and the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ed.gov/programs/psp|title=U.S, Presidential Scholars Program.|publisher=U.S. Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was established in 1964 by Executive Order of the [[President of the United States]] to recognize the most distinguished graduating seniors for their accomplishments in many areas: academic success, leadership, and service to school and community. In 1979, it was expanded to recognize students who demonstrate exceptional scholarship and talent in the visual, creative, and performing arts. In 2015, the program was expanded once again to recognize students who demonstrate ability and accomplishment in career and technical fields. In the recent past, the organization has welcomed nominations from individual recommenders of the students' own choosing regardless of whether these students' academic results or achievements otherwise qualified them for recognition; however, per the organization's website, at present, "application for the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program is by invitation only. Students may not apply individually to the program or be nominated (outside of the above process)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/programs/psp/eligibility.html|title=Eligibility.|publisher=U.S. Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annually, the presidentially-appointed White House Commission on Presidential Scholars chooses up to 161 U.S. Presidential Scholars from among that year's senior class. All Scholars are invited to Washington, DC in June for the National Recognition Program, featuring various events and enrichment activities and culminating in the presentation of the Presidential Scholars Medallion during a White House-sponsored ceremony.

To commemorate their achievements, the scholars are individually awarded the Presidential Medallion in a ceremony sponsored by the [[White House]].

==Selection process==

All candidates are invited to apply to the program in January of their graduation year. Applications are due in February. Semifinalists are announced in Mid-April and all Scholars are announced the first week of May. The National Recognition Program in Washington, DC usually occurs in June.

===General===
All graduating high school seniors who are citizens of the United States or legal permanent residents around the globe, enrolled in either private or public high schools, and who have scored exceptionally well on either the [[SAT]] of the [[College Board]] or the [[ACT (examination)|ACT Assessment]] of the [[American College Testing Program]] on or before October of each year are automatically considered for participation. 

The [[United States Department of Education]] then examines the test records for the top 30 males and top 30 females in each state/jurisdiction. The combined file of scores from the top male examinees and top female examinees are then ranked from high to low in each state. The scores associated with the top 20 male examinees and top 20 female examinees are used to identify the candidates in each state. When ties occur in the threshold score, more than 20 persons of that gender are invited in that state. In addition, each Chief State School Officer (CSSO) may nominate up to ten male and ten female candidates, residing in the CSSO's jurisdiction, based on their outstanding scholarship. Additionally, the program is partnering with several recognition organizations that will each nominate up to 10 candidates from their individual programs. Each year approximately 4,000 students are invited to apply to the program.

Candidates then go through a rigorous application process where they must submit candidacy materials, including essays, self-assessments, secondary school reports, and transcripts. Candidates are evaluated on their academic achievement, personal characteristics, leadership, service, and other extracurricular activities, and an analysis of their essays.

In mid-April approximately 800 Semifinalists are chosen by a review committee of qualified individuals experienced in secondary and post-secondary education. Six to twenty Semifinalists are identified for each state/jurisdiction. The number of Semifinalists identified per state/jurisdiction is proportionate to the number of candidates for that state.

In May, the White House Commission on Presidential Scholars makes the final selection of up to 161 Presidential Scholars. One male student and one female Scholar are chosen from the world, the [[District of Columbia]], the [[Commonwealth of Puerto Rico]], and from families of U.S. citizens and from citizens living abroad. In addition, up to fifteen Scholars are chosen [[at-large]].

===Arts===

====Overview====
The [[YoungArts|National YoungArts Foundation]] reviews approximately 12,000 candidates annually of 15- to 18-year-old artists in the fields of visual, literary, performing and design arts.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} From these they select (through a blind adjudication process) the top 600-700 artists in the nation as National Winners. 171 of these Winners travel to [[Miami, Florida]] for National YoungArts Week, where they are further adjudicated by panelists and can win up to $10,000 to help them pursue a career in the arts. These 171 Winners are then narrowed down to 60 nominees that are recommended to the White House Commission on Presidential Scholars. These 60 candidates are invited to apply, and the Commission, in turn, selects the 20 U.S. Presidential Scholars in the Arts.

====Selection====
Students must register and participate in YoungArts, a national program of the National Young Arts Foundation designed to identify, recognize and encourage talented high school seniors who demonstrate excellence in cinematic arts, dance, design, jazz, music, photography, theater, vocal performance, visual arts or writing.

Based on the discipline entered, registrants must submit audiotapes, videotapes, slides or manuscripts demonstrating artistic accomplishment. One panel for each arts discipline evaluates applicants in a two-step blind adjudication process. The judges review material submitted by the applicants and select up to 20 award candidates in each of the ten disciplines for live adjudications in Miami (YoungArts also has National Merit and Honorable Mention Winners that can attend one of three Regional Programs in Los Angeles, New York City and Miami, Florida, as well). All applicants are judged against a standard of excellence within each artistic discipline, not against each other.

The final judging from the National YoungArts Week results in the recognition of excellence in five different award categories. Upon completion of the YoungArts program, YoungArts will nominate up to sixty students who meet the eligibility requirements for the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program. These students will be mailed candidacy materials and invited to apply to the program.

To be considered further, candidates must submit candidacy materials, including essays, self-assessments, secondary school reports, and transcripts. Candidates are evaluated on their academic achievement, personal characteristics, leadership, service, and extracurricular activities, and an analysis of their essays.

Arts candidates enter the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program selection process at the semifinalist level. In April the White House Commission on Presidential Scholars makes the final selection of up to twenty U.S. Presidential Scholars in the Arts.
==Career and technical education==
In 2015, the program was again extended to recognize students who demonstrate ability and accomplishment in career and technical education fields. Students are nominated through their Chief State School Officer (CSSO). Each CSSO can nominate up to five candidates who meet the U.S. Presidential Scholars candidacy requirements for the 2016 program. Candidacy materials are mailed to the selected students, and they are invited to apply to the program. To be considered further, candidates must submit candidacy materials, including essays, self-assessments, secondary school reports, and transcripts. Candidates are evaluated on their academic achievement, personal characteristics, leadership, service, and extracurricular activities, and an analysis of their essays. Career and Technical Education candidates enter the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program selection process at the semifinalist level. In April the White House Commission on Presidential Scholars makes the final selection of up to twenty U.S. Presidential Scholars in Career and Technical Education.

A '''pushout''' is a student that leaves their [[school]] before graduation, through the encouragement of the school.  A student who leaves of their own accord (e.g., to work or care for a child), rather than through the action of the school, is considered a school [[Dropping out|dropout]].  In typical use, the category of pushouts excludes students who have been formally [[Expulsion (academia)|expelled]] from school for violating rules (e.g., for being violent).

Students may be pushed out of school because their presence in the school creates difficulty in meeting some goal of the school. For example, in the case where funding for the school is dependent upon scholastic achievement of the students, if the school can get rid of low-performing students, average test scores on academic performance tests will go up, thus increasing funding.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/31/nyregion/to-cut-failure-rate-schools-shed-students.html "To Cut Failure Rate, Schools Shed Students"] by Tamar Lewin and Jennifer Medina, ''New York Times''. July 31, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Schools may pushout [[truant]] students, who formally enroll in classes, but then refuse to attend.

In some low-performing schools in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] combined dropout/pushout rates have exceeded 25% in one year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030924235824/http://www.catalyst-chicago.org/06-99/069midyearchart.htm "Enrollment drops point to pushout effect", ''Catalyst, Voices of Chicago Educational Reform.'' June, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

Children are also pushed from schools because they present [[School discipline|discipline]] problems. Within youth advocacy and activist communities, pushout is a term that recognizes the intersecting forces of oppression most commonly responsible for high school "drop outs" within marginalized communities of color, allowing for the responsibility to be placed on those forces, rather than the youth impacted by unequal education, economics, disciplinary actions, and racism.

'''''Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action''''', 572 U.S. ___ (2014), was a case before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] questioning whether a [[U.S. state|state]] violates the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] by enshrining a ban on race- and sex-based discrimination on public university [[University and college admission#United States|admissions]] in its [[State constitution (United States)|state constitution]].&lt;ref name="Opinion"&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-682_8759.pdf Schuette v.

Coalition to Defend, et al.: Question Presented]&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was argued on October 15, 2013, on appeal from the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] which had ruled in 2012 that the [[Michigan]] ban, approved by the state's voters in 2006, was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewin|first=Tamar|title=Affirmative Action Ban in Michigan Is Rejected|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/education/michigans-affirmative-action-ban-is-ruled-unconstitutional.html|accessdate=April 22, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/12a0386p-06.pdf Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v. Regents of the University of Michigan, et al. (6th Cir. 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Sixth Circuit was reversed and the state ban upheld.

The case did not result in a majority opinion; [[Anthony Kennedy|Justice Kennedy]] wrote a plurality opinion. [[Elena Kagan|Justice Kagan]] took no part in the consideration or decision of the case, presumably because she had worked on the case during her time as [[United States Solicitor General]].&lt;ref name=NYT_Upheld /&gt;

==Background==
In 1961, President [[John F. Kennedy]] issued an [[executive order]] establishing the concept of affirmative action and mandating that federally financed projects ensure that their hiring and employment practices are free of racial bias. With the enactment of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin was prohibited.

In the first case involving affirmative action in higher education, the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Regents of the University of California v. Bakke]]'' (1978) that the [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] medical school admissions program violated the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] with the institution of quotas for underrepresented minorities. It did not, however, eliminate race as a factor in university admissions, calling diversity a "compelling interest."

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled in ''[[Hopwood v. Texas]]'' (5th Cir.1996) that the University of Texas School of Law could not use race as a factor in admissions. This was the first successful legal challenge to racial preferences since ''Bakke''.

Two cases in 2003 involving the [[University of Michigan]] found that the university's policy of granting extra points to minorities for undergraduate admissions was unconstitutional (''[[Gratz v. Bollinger]]'') but that a program which gave holistic consideration for being a certain racial minority, though not an automatic boost, in admissions to the law school was constitutional (''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'').

Michigan voters approved [[Michigan Civil Rights Initiative|Proposal 2]] in 2006 which amended the state's constitution to make affirmative action illegal in public employment, public education or public contracting purposes, except for actions mandated by federal law or that are necessary in order for an institution to receive federal funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(v01nqy55evrlgm45yajg5xj1))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&amp;objectName=mcl-Article-I-26 Mich. Const., Art. I, sec. 26]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court==
{{Expand section|date=April 2014}}
The Court heard oral argument on October 15, 2013. [[John J. Bursch]], then the [[Michigan Solicitor General]], argued for the petitioner, [[Michigan Attorney General]] [[Bill Schuette]]. Mark D. Rosenbaum argued for the Cantrell respondents, and Shanta Driver argued for the [[BAMN|Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action]]. Justice Elena Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/12-682 |title=Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action|last= Bensur |first=Gabriella |date=October 15, 2013 |publisher=Cornell University Law School |accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opinion and concurrences===
On April 22, 2014, the Court ruled for the petitioner that the ban on affirmative action in the [[Michigan Constitution]] is constitutional. [[Anthony Kennedy|Justice Kennedy]], writing the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140611060434/http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-682_j4ek.pdf plurality opinion] joined by [[John Roberts|Chief Justice Roberts]] and [[Samuel Alito|Justice Alito]], wrote that "[t]here is no authority in the [[Constitution of the United States]] or in this Court's precedents for the Judiciary to set aside Michigan laws that commit this policy determination to the voters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/04/opinion-analysis-affirmative-action-up-to-the-voters/|title=Opinion analysis: Affirmative action — up to the voters|last=Denniston|first=Lyle|date=April 22, 2014|publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]]|accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito joined in the plurality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howe|first=Amy|title=Divided Court upholds Michigan’s ban on affirmative action: In Plain English|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/04/divided-court-upholds-michigans-ban-on-affirmative-action-in-plain-english/|publisher=SCOTUSblog|accessdate=April 23, 2014|date=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief Justice Roberts also filed a concurring opinion, arguing that the dissent contains a paradox: the governing board banning affirmative action is an exercise of policymaking authority, but others who reach that conclusion (presumed to mean the supporters of Proposal 2) do not take race seriously. He continues that racial preferences may actually do more harm than good, as they reinforce doubt about whether or not minorities belong.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]] filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, joined by [[Clarence Thomas|Justice Thomas]]. He examines what he calls a "frighteningly bizarre question": Whether the [[Equal Protection Clause]] forbids what its text requires. He answers this by quoting his concurrence/dissent in ''Grutter'': that "the Constitution [forbids] government discrimination on the basis of race, and state-provided education is no exception." He asserts that the people of Michigan adopted that understanding of the clause as their fundamental law, and that by adopting it, "they did not simultaneously offend it."{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[Stephen Breyer|Justice Breyer]] filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, arguing that the case has nothing to do with reordering the political process, nor moving decision-making power from one level to another, but rather that university boards delegated admissions-related authority to unelected faculty and administration. He further argues that the same principle which supports the right of the people or their representatives to adopt affirmative action policies for the sake of inclusion also gives them the right to vote not to do so, as Michigan did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/572/12-682/concur5.html|title=Schuette v. Coal. Defend Affirmative Action, Integration &amp; Immigration Rights, 572 U.S. ___ (2014)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissent===
[[Sonia Sotomayor|Justice Sotomayor]] filed a dissent, joined by [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Justice Ginsburg]], outlining what she called the nation's "long and lamentable record of stymieing the right of racial minorities to participate in the political process." She charges that "[a] majority of the Michigan electorate changed the basic rules of the political process in that State in a manner that uniquely disadvantaged racial minorities." Sotomayor contended that those opposed to affirmative action policies could have either lobbied the boards of the state's universities to change their policies or, through the electoral process, changed the membership of the boards. She invokes the political-process doctrine, recognized in ''[[Hunter v. Erickson]]'' (1969) and ''[[Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1]]'' (2007), whereby "[w]hen the majority reconfigures the political process in a manner that burdens only a racial minority, that alteration triggers strict judicial scrutiny."  Sotomayor had previously credited her own admission to college to affirmative action, stating "I am the perfect affirmative action baby," and that without affirmative action "it would have been highly questionable if I would have been accepted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mears|first=Bill|title=Sotomayor says she was 'perfect affirmative action baby'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/06/11/sotomayor.affirmative.action/index.html|accessdate=2014-04-22|newspaper=CNN|date=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is based on the [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch]] programming language developed by the [[MIT Media Lab]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-06/14/open-university-coding-hardware&lt;/ref&gt; and uses .sb files&lt;ref&gt;http://labspace.open.ac.uk/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=454004&amp;section=2&lt;/ref&gt; like Scratch but the two pieces of software cannot use each other's files.&lt;ref&gt;http://labspace.open.ac.uk/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=454004&amp;section=2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sense programming environment is designed to work in conjunction with the SenseBoard, a specialised piece of hardware which connects to a user's computer via a [[USB]] connection.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-06/14/open-university-coding-hardware&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://labspace.open.ac.uk/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=439696&amp;section=3&lt;/ref&gt; The SenseBoard has different input types such as sensors for infrared, light, sound (microphone), and temperature (thermometer), and outputs such as a [[motor]] and [[light emitting diode]]s (LEDs).&lt;ref&gt;http://labspace.open.ac.uk/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=439696&lt;/ref&gt;

Sense and the SenseBoard are primarily used as part of the OU's ''My Digital Life (TU100)'' module,&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/course/tu100.htm&lt;/ref&gt; but is also used to a lesser degree on other modules. Sense was trialed in London schools in late 2012.

The '''Simplified Instructional Computer''' (also abbreviated SIC) is a hypothetical [[computer]] system introduced in ''System Software: An Introduction to Systems Programming'', by Leland Beck. Due to the fact that most modern microprocessors include subtle, complex functions for the purposes of efficiency, it can be difficult to learn systems programming using a real-world system. The Simplified Instructional Computer solves this by abstracting away these complex behaviors in favor of an architecture that is clear and accessible for those wanting to learn systems programming.

== SIC Architecture ==
The SIC machine has basic addressing, storing most memory addresses hexadecimal integer format. Similar to most modern computing systems, the SIC architecture stores all data in binary and uses the [[two's complement]] to represent negative values at the machine level. Memory storage in SIC consists of 8-bit bytes, and all memory addresses in SIC are byte addresses. Any three consecutive bytes form a 24-bit 'word' value, addressed by the location of the lowest numbered byte in the word value. Numeric values are stored as word values, and character values use the 8-bit [[ASCII]] system. The SIC machine does not support floating-point hardware and have at most 32,768 bytes of memory. There is also a more complicated machine built on top of SIC called the Simplified Instruction Computer with Extra Equipment (SIC/XE). The XE expansion of SIC adds a 48-bit floating point data type, an additional memory addressing mode, and extra memory (1 megabyte instead of 32,768 bytes) to the original machine. All SIC assembly code is upwards compatible with SIC/XE.

SIC machines have several registers, each 24 bits long and having both a numeric and character representation:
:* '''A (0)''': Used for basic arithmetic operations; known as the accumulator register.
:* '''X (1)''': Stores and calculates addresses; known as the index register.
:* '''L (2)''': Used for jumping to specific memory addresses and storing return addresses; known as the linkage register.
:* '''PC (8)''': Contains the address of the next instruction to execute; known as the program counter register.
:* '''SW (9)''': Contains a variety of information, such as carry or overflow flags; known as the status word register.

In addition to the standard SIC registers, there are also four additional general-purpose registers specific to the SIC/XE machine:
:* '''B (3)''': Used for addressing; known as the base register.
:* '''S (4)''': No special use, general purpose register.
:* '''T (5)''': No special use, general purpose register.
:* '''F (6)''': Floating point accumulator register (This register is 48-bits instead of 24).

These five/nine registers allow the SIC or SIC/XE machine to perform most simple tasks in a customized assembly language. In the System Software book, this is used with a theoretical series of operation codes to aid in the understanding of assemblers and linker-loaders required for the execution of [[assembly language]] code.

==Addressing Modes for SIC and SIC/XE==
The Simplified Instruction Computer has three instruction formats, and the Extra Equipment add-on includes a fourth. The instruction formats provide a model for memory and data management. Each format has a different representation in memory:
:*'''Format 1''': Consists of 8 bits of allocated memory to store instructions.
:*'''Format 2''': Consists of 16 bits of allocated memory to store 8 bits of instructions and two 4-bits segments to store operands.
:*'''Format 3''': Consists of 6 bits to store an instruction, 6 bits of flag values, and 12 bits of displacement.
:*'''Format 4''': Only valid on SIC/XE machines, consists of the same elements as format 3, but instead of a 12-bit displacement, stores a 20-bit address.

Both format 3 and format 4 have six-bit flag values in them, consisting of the following flag bits:
:*'''n''': Indirect addressing flag
:*'''i''': Immediate addressing flag
:*'''x''': Indexed addressing flag
:*'''b''': Base address-relative flag
:*'''p''': Program counter-relative flag
:*'''e''': Format 4 instruction flag

==Addressing Modes for SIC/XE==
* Rule 1:
*: e = 0 : format 3
*: e = 1 : format 4
** format 3:
**: b = 1, p = 0    (base relative)
**: b = 0, p = 1    (pc relative)
**: b = 0, p = 0    (direct addressing)
** format 4:
**: b = 0, p = 0    (direct addressing)
**: x = 1    (index)
**: i = 1, n = 0    (immediate)
**: i = 0, n = 1    (indirect)
**: i = 0, n = 0    (SIC)
**: i = 1, n = 1    (SIC/XE for SIC compatible)
* Rule 2:
*: i = 0, n =0	(SIC)
*: b, p, e is part of the address.

== SIC Assembly Syntax ==
SIC uses a special assembly language with its own operation codes that hold the hex values needed to assemble and execute programs. A sample program is provided below to get an idea of what a SIC program might look like. In the code below, there are three columns. The first column represents a forwarded symbol that will store its location in memory. The second column denotes either a SIC instruction (opcode) or a constant value (BYTE or WORD). The third column takes the symbol value obtained by going through the first column and uses it to run the operation specified in the second column. This process creates an object code, and all the object codes are put into an object file to be run by the SIC machine.

If you were to assemble this program, you would get the object code depicted below. The beginning of each line consists of a record type and hex values for memory locations. For example, the top line is an 'H' record, the first 6 hex digits signify its relative starting location, and the last 6 hex digits represent the program's size. The lines throughout are similar, with each 'T' record consisting of 6 hex digits to signify that line's starting location, 2 hex digits to indicate the size (in bytes) of the line, and the object codes that were created during the assembly process.

== Emulating the SIC System ==
Since the SIC and SIC/XE machines are not real machines, the task of actually constructing a SIC emulator is often part of coursework in a systems programming class. The purpose of SIC is to teach introductory-level systems programmers or collegiate students how to write and assemble code below higher-level languages like C and C++. With that being said, there are some sources of SIC-emulating programs across the web, however infrequent they may be.

'''Southeastern Louisiana University''' ('''Southeastern''') is a state-funded public [[university]] in [[Hammond, Louisiana]], United States. It was founded in 1925 by [[Linus A. Sims]], the [[Principal (school)|principal]] of [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]] [[High school (North America)|High School]], as [[Hammond Junior College]], located in a wing of the high school building. Sims succeeded in getting the campus moved to north Hammond in 1928, when it became known as Southeastern Louisiana College. It achieved university status in 1970.

==Description==
Enrolled are 14,594 students representing 43 states and 66 countries. During the 1990s, Southeastern was one of the fastest-growing colleges in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.southeastern.edu/orgs/NCATE/ncate/InstitutionalReport/OverviewIR.htm|title=Southeastern Louisiana University - SACS Reaffirmation of Accreditation|website=www2.southeastern.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The university is the third largest in Louisiana, trailing only [[Louisiana State University|LSU]] and the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/southeastern-louisiana-2024|title=Southeastern Louisiana University|work=US News Best Colleges}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Southeastern's colors are [[Green (color)|green]] and [[Gold (color)|gold]], and the mascot is the ''[[Lions]]''. Southeastern's sports teams participate in NCAA Division I (FCS for [[College football|football]]) in the [[Southland Conference]].

The Hammond campus is located {{convert|45|mi|km}} east of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] and {{convert|60|mi|km}} northwest of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].

==History==
[[File:Southeastern Louisiana University Student Union.jpg|thumb|left|Commons Area in Southeastern's War Memorial Student Union]]
What began as a junior college supported by local taxes developed into a major university as Southeastern has grown to meet the evolving needs of southeast Louisiana and the [[Florida parishes]].&lt;ref&gt;Southeastern Louisiana University. (2006).
[http://www.selu.edu/about/overview/history/index.html A Brief History of Southeastern] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905010953/http://www.selu.edu/about/overview/history/index.html |date=2006-09-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fayard Hall from the east 2010-10-05.JPG|right|thumb|Fayard Hall, completed in 2001, makes practical use of brick, glass, light, and open space.]]

On July 7, 1925, the voters overwhelmingly approved a bond issue that created Hammond Junior College. Operated under the auspices of the [[Tangipahoa Parish School Board]], Sims opened the doors on September 13, 1925, with a faculty of three women and two men and 40 students. The two-year coeducational institution offered basic undergraduate work in arts and sciences that culminated in a teaching certificate.

Rapidly increasing enrollments quickly forced the college out of its two rooms in Hammond High School. In 1927, voters supported the purchase of the Hunter Leake estate on Hammond's north end. In 1928, Hammond Junior College became Southeastern Louisiana College, formally adopted into the state educational system under the control of the State Board of Education. The purchase of {{convert|60|acre|m2}} adjoining the original {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} plot provided the space to develop a suitable campus. In 1934, a state bond issue provided for the construction of McGehee Hall and a gymnasium.

Lucius McGehee Hall was built in 1935. {{as of|2009}} it is the oldest building constructed by the University. McGehee Hall is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

In 1937, the State Board of Education authorized curricula for four-year programs in liberal arts, teacher education, business administration, music, social sciences, and physical education. The first baccalaureate degrees were conferred in May 1939.

Sims Memorial Library (right). Zachary Taylor Hall is the only academic building in Louisiana named for the sole [[President of the United States|President]] to come from Louisiana.]]
Voter approval of Act 388 in 1938, an amendment to the 1920 Louisiana Constitution, granted Southeastern Louisiana College the same legal status as other four-year colleges. The amendment did not, however, require the state to fund Southeastern at the level of other institutions of higher education, despite strong local support.

On January 18, 1946, the State Board made available funds to purchase seven city blocks east and west of the campus, and {{convert|275|acre|km2}} of land north and northwest of the campus, increasing Southeastern's total area to approximately {{convert|365|acre|km2}}.

On March 3, 1946, Southeastern was formally approved and accepted into full membership in the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), as a four-year degree-granting institution.

After World War II, returning G.I.s caused exponential growth of the college, necessitating construction of classrooms, a student union, a cafeteria, a health center, dormitories, apartments for married students, and many surplus temporary buildings donated by the federal government. In 1948, the U.S. Navy contributed two steel barracks for use as dormitories including McNeely Hall (which was demolished in 2007).

In 1960, the State Board authorized Southeastern to offer master's degrees through the newly formed Division of Graduate Studies. Southeastern began awarding the Education Specialist degree in 1967. The War Memorial Student Union, constructed in the mid-1960s, is the only student union building in the United States dedicated to alumni who died in World War II. 
In 1969, the college awarded its first Distinguished Alumnus Award to jazz pianist [[Bill Evans]].
[[governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[John McKeithen]] on June 16, 1970, signed into law the legislative act turning Southeastern Louisiana College into Southeastern Louisiana University. Early 1970s also saw the construction of D Vickers, the Athletics Building, and the C.E. Cate Teacher Education Building.

After years of planning and fundraising, the [[Southeastern Louisiana University Center]] was constructed. An 8000-seat (more if the floor level is used) arena, the University Center hosts all home basketball games and a variety of civic, cultural, and big-name entertainment events.

In October 1986, a group of faculty members launched Fanfare, a festival celebrating the arts, humanities and sciences. Since then, Fanfare has become an acclaimed month-long event, drawing nationally and internationally recognized artists and providing recognition for those closer to home. In addition to providing entertainment for [[Lake Pontchartrain]]'s Northshore Area, Fanfare has an educational-outreach program that works closely with local schools. In October 2005, Fanfare proudly celebrated its 20th anniversary.

Southeastern's enrollment, continually increasing since its inception, reached an important milestone in 1997, registering over 15 thousand students for the fall semester. Pervasive professional accreditations, such as accreditation of the College of Business by [[AACSB]], and excellent egress from/to [[I-55]] and [[Interstate 12|I-12]] figure significantly in the increase. From its founding in 1925 until 2009,  Southeastern has conferred more than 50,000 degrees.

As Southeastern celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2000, the fall semester marked an exciting change as Southeastern implemented screened admissions standards for the first time. Also during the 2000–2001 academic year, the Village, Fayard Hall, and the Claude B. Pennington, Jr., Student Activity Center were completed.

In May 2001, Southeastern received full approval from the Board of Regents for its first new graduate degree program in more than a decade, an MS in Integrated Science and Technology. Since then, Southeastern received approval for seven additional programs: MA in Organizational Communications, MS in Applied Sociology, BS in Athletic Training, BS in Health Education &amp; Promotion, BS in Health Studies, BS in Occupational Health, Safety &amp; Environment, and Master of Arts in Teaching.

In 2001 Southeastern took ownership of the historic [[Columbia Theatre for the Performing Arts]] in downtown Hammond. The theater is operated by a separate foundation and presents a variety of theatrical works, concerts, and dance performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://columbiatheatre.org/#/about-us|title=About Us|work=Columbia Theatre for the Performing Arts|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Fall 2003, Southeastern hit a record enrollment of 15,662 students. Fall 2003 also saw the return of football to Strawberry Stadium, after an 18-year hiatus. The Lions completed the season 5–7.

In the fall of 2004, Southeastern began implementing portions of the Board of Regents Master Plan admissions criteria, a full year ahead of schedule and before any other schools in the state.

In Fall 2005, Southeastern began its first year under the full Board of Regents Master Plan admissions criterion. In the same semester Southeastern, which was virtually undamaged by [[Hurricane Katrina]], absorbed some two thousand students whom the storm had displaced from institutions in [[New Orleans]]. North of the War Memorial Student Union is a large fountain constructed and dedicated in 2007 to the victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita]]; {{as of|2009|lc=y}} it is the only such memorial fountain in existence.

Southeastern owns the [[Columbia Theatre for the Performing Arts]] in Hammond's Historic District. First opened in 1928, the Columbia was acquired by the university in the 1990s and renovated in the amount of $5.6 million. The large foyer is dedicated to the late State Senator [[John Hainkel]], who was instrumental in obtaining the funding for the renovation.

Southeastern has several state-of-the-art athletic facilities, including an eight-lane [[all-weather running track]] completed in 2011 (see inset).

== Media ==
Southeastern's major campus media and publications are the ''Lion's Roar'' (newspaper), [[KSLU]] (FM radio station), ''ByLion'' (weekly online publication), the Southeastern Channel ([[Public-access television|public access]] [[cable television]] channel), and ''Le Souvenir'' (official yearbook).

=== ''The Lion's Roar'' ===
''The Lion's Roar'' is the official newspaper of the students of Southeastern Louisiana University. Distributed on Tuesdays, it is published weekly during regular semesters and monthly during the summer semester. ''The Lion's Roar'' is planned, written, designed, created, and published by the students of Southeastern Louisiana University working in the Office of Student Publications, a part of the Division of Student Affairs. ''The Lion's Roar'' has been in continuous publication since 1937.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.selu.edu/admin/lionsroar/ The Lion's Roar Newspaper].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== KSLU radio station ===
Southeastern's [[KSLU]]-[[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] station began operation on November 11, 1974, as a radio club at the university, operating at 10 watts of power. Initially the station was on the air a few hours a day during the week; the transmitter was turned off during weekends and holidays. Thanks to support from the Student Government Association and self-assessed fees of the student body, in 1983 the station qualified for membership in the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]]. Since that time the station has grown to 3,000 watts, the maximum allowed because of the crowded 88–92&amp;nbsp;MHz band and the university's proximity to Baton Rouge and New Orleans.

In 1988, KSLU became the first radio station in [[Southern United States|the South]] to install a digital touchscreen operating system. The installation was featured in ''[[Broadcast Engineering (magazine)|Broadcast Engineering]]'' magazine and visited by radio personnel from across the world.

Background: Part of the multimillion-dollar Pennington Student Activity Center, a full-service health and exercise club for students. The view is from the north.]]
The broadcast schedule offers non-commercial programs, with offerings including local talk shows, entertainment and sports news, campus and community activities.

In 1993, an emergency-situation room was added using [[amateur radio]] equipment purchased with grants from [[State Farm Insurance]] and Louisiana Power &amp; Light (a subsidiary of [[Entergy]]). During critical times, this room is staffed by local ham operators, members of the Amateur Radio Emergency Service in the [[Florida Parishes]] area.

In the past, the station produced several political forums which were fed to all public radio stations in Louisiana and to commercial stations via the Louisiana News Network.

The year 1996 brought another phase as [[KSLU]] began broadcasting globally via the [[internet]], enabling families of international and out-of-state students to hear live university events.&lt;ref&gt;Southeastern Louisiana University. (2006). [http://www.kslu.org/history.php 90.9 KSLU History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019004538/http://kslu.org/history.php |date=2006-10-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''ByLion'' ===
''ByLion'' is published weekly online (bi-weekly during the summer session) for the faculty and staff of Southeastern Louisiana University. This newspaper is very popular among freshman students.&lt;ref&gt;Southeastern Louisiana University. (2007). [http://www.selu.edu/news_media/bylion/ ByLion].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cable TV Channel ===
The Southeastern Channel officially began July 9, 2002.
[[File:Southeastern Oaks residences 2010-01-03.JPG|thumb|left|Many Southeastern Louisiana University students reside in the fenced and gated on-campus community known as Southeastern Oaks. The gate is about 200 yards or 180 meters north of the [[LA 3234]] pedestrian underpass.]]

The Southeastern Channel won four Telly Awards in 2007. Staff member Steve Zaffuto won two Bronze Tellys for animation of "Native Sounds" and "Current Events" promotions, and Josh Kapusinski won a first-place Silver Telly for animation and a Bronze Telly for editing the "Florida Parish Chronicles" promo. Josh Kapusinski's "Florida Parish Chronicles" promo won a 2006 Emmy Award in the Suncoast Region.&lt;ref&gt;Southeastern Louisiana University. (2007). [http://www.selu.edu/news_media/news_releases/2007/aug/tellys.html Southeastern Channel wins four Telly awards].&lt;/ref&gt;

Alumni of the public-access TV channel include Randi Rousseau, Christopher Guagliardo, Chris Lecoq, Matt Milton, Nick Brilleaux, Robbie Rhodes, Travis Connelley, Tim Tregle, Tim Tully, John Reis, Allen Waddell, Whitney Magee, and Chris Coleman.&lt;ref&gt;Southeastern Louisiana University.

''Le Souvenir'' is the official student yearbook of Southeastern. It is published annually and distributed to the student body in the fall semester. ''Le Souvenir'' is planned, written, designed, created, and published by the students of Southeastern working in the Office of Student Publications, a part of the Division of Student Affairs.

'''Theodore Ryland Sizer''' (June 23, 1932 – October 21, 2009) was a leader of [[educational reform]] in the [[United States]], the founder (and eventually President Emeritus) of the [[Coalition of Essential Schools|Essential school]] movement and was known for challenging longstanding practices and assumptions about the functioning of American secondary schools. Beginning in the late 1970s, he had worked with hundreds of [[High school (North America)|high schools]], studying the development and design of the [[American educational system]], leading to his major work ''Horace's Compromise'' in 1984.  In the same year, he founded the [[Coalition of Essential Schools]] based on the principles espoused in ''Horace's Compromise''.&lt;ref name="ted1"&gt;{{cite web   | title = Theodore R. Sizer   | url = http://www.essentialschools.org/pub/ces_docs/about/org/execboard/ted_page.html   | deadurl = yes   | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060930011247/http://www.essentialschools.org/pub/ces_docs/about/org/execboard/ted_page.html   | archivedate = 2006-09-30   | df =    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sizer was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] to [[Theodore Sizer (art historian)|Theodore Sizer, Sr.]] (1892–1967), an art history professor at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name="HGSE"&gt;{{cite web |title=Theodore Ryland Sizer, born 1932 |website=Harvard Graduate School of Education |publisher=Harvard University |url=http://www.gse.harvard.edu/about/history/deans/sizer/ |accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his B.A. in English from Yale in 1953 and subsequently served in the [[United States Army|Army]] as an artillery officer.  He later described his experience leading soldiers in a democratic and egalitarian fashion as a formative influence on his ideas about education.  After  teaching in high schools, he earned his masters and doctorate in education from [[Harvard University]] in 1957 and 1961, respectively.  He was a faculty member and later dean of the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]], a position he held during the 1969 Harvard student strike. While dean, he reorganized the school into seven departments, expanding the resources available for research (particularly in the area of urban education), while expanding minority enrollment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Theodore Ryland Sizer, born 1932. Dean, 1964-1972 | url = http://www.gse.harvard.edu/about/history/deans/sizer/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, he received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]  for Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theodore R.Sizer|url=http://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/theodore-r-sizer//|publisher=[[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sizer left Harvard to serve as headmaster of [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]] from 1972 to 1981, to lead a study of American high schools sponsored by the National Association of Secondary School Principals and the [[National Association of Independent Schools]]. From 1983 to 1997, he worked at [[Brown University]] as a professor and chair of the education department,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | title = Ted Sizer: A Vision for Education   | url = http://www.andover.edu/publications/1999winter_bulletin/sizer/sizer.htm   | deadurl = yes   | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060904200633/http://www.andover.edu/publications/1999winter_bulletin/sizer/sizer.htm   | archivedate = 2006-09-04   | df =    }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1993, he became the Founding Director of the Annenberg Institute for School Reform.&lt;ref name="ted1" /&gt;

During his years at Brown, he produced most of his books, including  ''Horace's Compromise.''  In it, he examined&lt;ref name="Ted2"&gt;{{cite web   | title = Who the Heck is Ted Sizer   | url = http://gothamschools.org/2009/10/23/who-the-hell-is-ted-szer/   | deadurl = yes   | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101218071803/http://gothamschools.org/2009/10/23/who-the-hell-is-ted-szer/   | archivedate = 2010-12-18   | df =    }}&lt;/ref&gt; the fundamental compromise at the heart of allegedly successful American high schools. He suggested that the students agree to generally behave in exchange for the schools agreeing not to push them too hard or challenge them too severely. Thus, he widened the scope of schools that were failing to do their best to educate children far beyond the traditionally criticized poor and urban schools and challenged the conceptions of what could be considered a successful school. The ideas explored in his ''Horace Trilogy'' supply much of the foundation of the [[Coalition of Essential Schools]].

After retiring from Brown, Sizer took a one-year position during the 1998–99 school year as co-principal (with his wife Nancy Faust Sizer) of the [[Francis W. Parker Charter Essential School]], of which he was a Trustee Emeritus and helped to found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Profile of the Parker School | url = http://www.parker.org/PrintedResources/AnnualReport00-01/profile_of_the_parker_school.htm | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060821192102/http://www.parker.org/PrintedResources/AnnualReport00-01/profile_of_the_parker_school.htm | archivedate = 2006-08-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their book, ''Keeping School'' (coauthored with [[Deborah Meier]] and Nancy Faust Sizer), drew from this experience. From 1997 through 2006, Sizer returned to the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]] as a visiting professor, co-teaching a course on redesigning the American secondary school with his wife,&lt;ref name="Ted3"&gt;{{cite web | title = Harvard Graduate School of Education Obituary | url =http://www.gse.harvard.edu/blog/news_features_releases/2009/10/dean-theodore-r-sizer-1932-2009.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he continued to work on the issues of integrating the multiple services that low [[socio-economic status]] families need in poor communities.

His wife, Nancy Faust Sizer, whom he married in 1955, was also an educator, and they had four children.  He died at age 77 on October 21, 2009 at his home in [[Harvard, Massachusetts]] due to [[colon cancer]].

'''The Fullbridge Program''' is a learning curriculum held by [[educational technology]] company Fullbridge, Inc. which teaches basic business techniques.&lt;ref name=denver&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.denverpost.com/2013/06/23/fullbridge-program-gives-colorado-undergrads-crash-course-in-business/| publisher=The Denver Post| title=Fullbridge Program gives Colorado undergrads crash course in business| author=Adrian D. Garcia| date=June 23, 2013| access-date=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Fullbridge Inc. was founding by former [[Random house]] chairman Peter Olson and his wife, [[iVillage]] founder [[Candice Carpenter Olson]], in 2010.&lt;ref name=ed&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.edsurge.com/news/fullbridge-5-5-million| publisher=EdSurge| title=Fullbridge $5.5 Million| date=May 30, 2012| access-date=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=denver/&gt;

In January 2012, Fullbridge launched a pilot program aimed at college students and recent graduates, and subsequently focused on larger programs that summer. Then Fullbridge established a suite of vertical business-to-business programs for law firms, consulting firms, financial firms, service organizations, universities, and corporations.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In September 2012, Fullbridge partnered with Andrews Kurth to expand the law firm's attorney professional development program. Andrews Kurth was the third law firm in the United States to partner with Fullbridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.andrewskurth.com/news-371.html| publisher=Andrews Kurth| title=Andrews Kurth Collaborates with The Fullbridge Program to Help Prepare New Associates for the Practice of Law| date=September 6, 2012| access-date=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fullbridge has worked in the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]] helping young women prepare for new vocational opportunities and offered a four-week Business Fundamentals Program at [[Prince Sultan University]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Fullbridge started out in [[Harvard Square|Harvard Square, Cambridge, MA]], and later moved to [[Downtown Crossing, Boston, Massachusetts|Downtown Boston, MA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ed Tech Company Fullbridge Looks to Expand With $5M in New Funding|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/10/14/ed-tech-company-fullbridge-looks-to-expand-with-5m-in-new-funding/|website=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Fullbridge received $5.5 million in funding from GSV Capital Corp., Tomorrow Ventures, and Harris Preston.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt;

In summer 2013, The Fullbridge Program was presented at Red Rocks Community College in Arvada, Colorado.&lt;ref name=denver/&gt;

[[Image:T2G.jpg|right|Train to Gain logo]]

'''Train to Gain''' ('''T2G'''), was a [[UK government]] funded initiative to deliver [[vocational training|vocational]] [[training]] to employed adults. It was discontinued in 2010.

Train to Gain was designed to deliver [[vocational training|vocational]] [[training]] to employed individuals in the UK, primarily those in the 25+ age band who did not already have a [[NQF|Full Level 2 Qualification]], via the Skills Funding Agency, formerly the [[Learning and Skills Council]] (LSC). The initiative was rolled out nationally in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bytestart.co.uk/content/legal/35_1/Train-to-Gain-scheme.shtml 'Train to Gain' roll-out to boost UK business skills], Bytestart Limited, 2006-09-20&lt;/ref&gt; Train to Gain formed a part of the [[Employer Responsive]] training model. On 24 May 2010 the UK government announced a £200 million reduction in this programme as part of its planned £6.2 billion reduction in expenditure in the 2010-11 government financial year. The Train to Gain brand was scrapped in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://feweek.co.uk/2011/10/28/adult-apprenticeships-benefit-from-train-to-gain-funding/ FEWeek: Adult apprenticeships benefit from Train to Gain funding]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Train to Gain was designed to ameliorate the skills deficiency in the UK identified by the [[Leitch review]].&lt;ref&gt;Leitch Review&lt;/ref&gt;  The purported idea of the service is to offer skills advice and match business needs with [[Further Education]] and training providers. The service will also identify any funding or grants that can be used to offset the investment in training. The support and advice offered by Train to Gain is claimed to be flexible, responsive and offered at a time and place to suit businesses.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The supposed appeal to employers is that they receive targeted, quality approved training to upskill their staff in line with their individual and business related needs. The appeal to employees is allegedly that they are invested in, given training to help them in their role and the opportunity to certify their existing skills. In addition to this there is funding available to improve their overall skills and levels of literacy and numeracy. A NAO report published in July 2009 queried whether the tax payer was receiving good value for money from this programme.

== The Skills Brokerage service ==

Train to Gain is designed to maximise on the effectiveness of the Skills Brokerage — Skills Brokers liaise with employers to identify their skill needs and then provide a matching service with appropriate training providers.  Thus Train to Gain can also reference the entirety of employer training and liaison.

== Learner eligibility ==

The fundamental criteria for eligibility for Train to Gain core funding are:

*No Full Level 2 or higher (equivalent to 5 GCSEs at A*-C)
*25 and over
*EU resident for the last 3 years
*Employed (by an English employer)

Learners in the 19–25 age band are eligible for funding through Train to Gain where an [[apprenticeship]] would not be considered appropriate, for example where the learner is on a temporary contract.  Apprenticeships are the UK government's preferred route for vocational training in this age group.  Learners below the age of 19 cannot be funded through Train to Gain.

== Qualification eligibility ==

Qualifications that are eligible for funding via Train to Gain are identified as such in the LSC's [https://web.archive.org/web/20080517052603/http://providers.lsc.gov.uk/LAD/ Learning Aims Database] (LAD).  These are primarily NVQs at level 2 or level 3 alongside [[Skills for Life]] at levels 1 &amp; 2.

== Flexibilities ==

During the course of the 07/08 [[Academic year#United Kingdom|contract year]] the LSC released several additional "flexibilities" applying to learner eligibility.  These allowed [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s to access the Train to Gain service, as well as [[Self-employment|self-employed]] learners.  A further flexibility allows exemption from the criteria concerning prior attainment (i.e. no full level 2), for learners coming through the [[Jobcentre Plus|local employment partnership]] (LEP) route.  That is to say, those learners who find work through Jobcentre Plus and subsequently come on to Train to Gain.

The LSC has outlined further enhancements to the Train to Gain service in a [http://www.traintogainprovidersse.org.uk/uploads/Mark%20Hayson%20Letter%20re%20new%20flexibilities%20June%2008.pdf recent letter]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} to training providers.  These include additional level 2s and level 3s for those who already have them (under specific circumstances), accessibility to Skills for life for those ineligible due to prior attainment and funding for Skills for life at levels other than 1 and 2.

'''Trudl Dubsky Zipper''' (31 January 1913 – 3 July 1976) was an Austrian-American innovative [[dancer]], [[choreographer]] and [[dance teacher|teacher]].

Born in [[Vienna]], she trained and performed with the [[Gertrud Bodenwieser|Bodenwieser School]] and was renowned for her dynamic modern dancing and high leaps.

She co-founded the Rutherston-Dubsky School in [[London]] and later performed and taught in the [[Philippines]]. Dubsky was also an accomplished visual artist and her paintings of [[Manila]] during the Japanese occupation were published in ''[[Life Magazine]]''.

Dubsky continued as a teacher and choreography throughout her life, including at the [[Chicago Conservatory of Music]], and later at the [[University of Southern California]]. The Colburn Dance Institute was renamed the Trudl Zipper Dance Institute in 2008 to honor this woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geni.com/people/Trudl-Zipper/6000000025518938415 |title=Trudl Dubsky |date=2015 |access-date=2016-01-30 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was married to the composer [[Herbert Zipper]], whom she married in the Philippines in 1939. She died in Los Angeles in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;''California, Death Index, 1940-1997

The word is a [[neologism]] that results from the [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] of a [[word play]] on "intellectual" ("Tellekt-Ual-In").&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn and Constantine (2004, xix, 251).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mark Clark:&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, M. W. (July 2006). ''Hero or Villain? Bertolt Brecht and the Crisis Surrounding June 1953''. Journal of Contemporary History. vol. 41 no. 3. pp. 451–475.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|... the critique of intellectuals which Brecht developed... around the notion of ‘Tuismus’ engages a model of the public intellectual in which the self-image of the artist and thinker as a socially and politically engaged person corresponded to the expectations of the public. Partisan without being bound to a party, independent of official institutions yet experienced in surviving within institutions, prepared to entertain risks and undertake unconventional experiments: this was how Brecht accommodated a world which he envisioned as changeable. His antagonistic worldview fed on crisis and found its most productive, creative impulse in the escalation of contradictions.}}

Brecht routinely referred to the members of the [[Frankfurt School]], particularly [[Theodor Adorno]], as "Tuis".&lt;ref&gt;Jay (1996, 201–202).&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding term "Tuism" describes the theory and practice of the Tui-intellectual.&lt;ref&gt;Leming (2005, 43–45).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
UCSA's governing body is its [[board of directors]], which is chartered to be made up of the external vice presidents of all UC [[student governments in the United States|student governments]]. However, UCSA generally requires each student government to pay dues to maintain voting rights on the board.&lt;ref name=charter/&gt; Thus, student governments may effectively "withdraw" from UCSA by refusing to pay dues. 

In May 2017, the UCSA board of directors included voting members from 18 student governments.  That number dropped to 11 in 2018 because a number of professional and graduate student governments withdrew from UCSA and formed a separate organization named "University of California Graduate and Professional Council".&lt;ref&gt;Website of the [https://www.ucgpc.org University of California Graduate and Professional Council.]&lt;/ref&gt;  

{{As of|2018|November}}, the UCSA board of directors included voting members from the following student governments:&lt;ref name="Board"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ucsa.org/about/student-board/|title=Student Board|publisher=University of California Student Association|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These semifinalists are then interviewed by the UCSA board of directors. The board chooses three applicants, who are then interviewed by a special Regents' committee. The committee then recommends a nominee to the full board of [[University of California Regents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/about/members-and-advisors/app17_final.pdf|title=2017-2018 Student Regent of The University of California Application Form|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Policy"/&gt;

Baird was born in Indiana on June 16, 1862. He was educated at [[Hanover College]] (Bachelor's degree in 1885, PhD in 1903, and Doctor of Divinity in 1913) and [[McCormick Theological Seminary]] (graduated 1888). Baird sailed to Korea to do missionary work, arriving in 1891, less than two months after marrying Annie Adams (December 18, 1890).  His first missionizing was in [[Busan]] in September of the same year.&lt;ref name="Ja-young 2021, p. 20"&gt;Yi Ja-young, "Founder of SSU, William M. Baird," ''The Soongsil Times XXIX (137):2021, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with a "Sarangbang" class in [[Pyeongyang]] in 1897, Baird's efforts grew into the Soongsil School in 1900 and eventually into an institution of higher education, graduating its first students in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Yi Ja-young, "Founder of SSU, William M. Baird," ''The Soongsil Times XXIX (137):2021, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1931. Baird Hall on the Soongsil campus is named after him, and there is a bronze bust of him there as well.&lt;ref name="Ja-young 2021, p. 20"/&gt; &lt;!-- DIED 1937? --&gt;
