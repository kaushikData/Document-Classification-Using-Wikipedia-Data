== Accessibility ==
ATutor is the first LCMS to comply completely with the accessibility specifications of [[W3C]] [[WCAG]] 1.0 at the AA+ level, allowing the access to all the included content of the system at all levels of user-privilege, including administrator accounts.&lt;ref&gt;For details on the WCAG specification, see: [http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/ Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0].&lt;/ref&gt; Its conformity with [[XHTML]] 1.0 is intended to ensure that ATutor is presented and displayed consistently in any compatible technology.

ATutor's developers assert that it is the only fully accessible LCMS software on the market, including for-fee and closed source software. This aspect of ATutor has been affirmed in at least one University-published review of the software.&lt;ref name="Clark000" /&gt; ATutor is also cited in numerous technical reviews and scholarly articles; and many [[Software extension|third-party extensions]] have been developed and distributed for use with the software.&lt;ref name="Clark000" /&gt;

== Background ==
ATutor was first released in late 2002. It came in response to two studies conducted by the developer in the years prior that looked at the accessibility of online learning systems to people with disabilities. Results of the studies showed none of the popular Learning Management Systems at the time even provided minimal conformance with accessibility guidelines. At the time a blind person for instance, could not participate fully in online courses.&lt;ref&gt;For related details, consult: ''Technical Evaluation Report 37. Assistive Software for Disabled Learners.'' (referenced ''supra'').&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accessibility features ===
Two, of many, accessibility features in the system are text alternatives for all visual elements, and keyboard access to all elements of the program. With these features, a blind person can listen to the entire interface of the system with the help of a screen reader, and he or she can access the system without needing a mouse. These features also allow ATutor to adapt to a wide variety of technologies including cell phones, personal data assistants (PDAs), and text-based Web browsers, to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;A full list of accessibility features can be found on the ATutor Web site. (https://atutor.github.io)&lt;/ref&gt;

ATutor includes a content authoring tool that prompts content developers to create accessible learning materials. Such prompts encourage authors to add a text alternatives if they forget to include one when adding an image, for instance. The authoring tool also includes a Web service that evaluates the accessibility of authored content against various international standards. In addition to creating accessible content, the tool is itself accessible, allowing a blind user to create content themselves.

=== Adaptability features ===
ATutor is also designed for adaptability to any of several teaching and learning scenarios. There are four main areas that reflect this design principle: themes, privileges, tool modules, and groups.&lt;ref&gt;For additional details, consult ''Virtual Highschool Based on LMS open source and learning objects.'', ''Constructivist Learning: An Operational Approach for Designing Adaptive Learning Environments Supporting Cognitive Flexibility'' (referenced ''supra'').&lt;/ref&gt;

The ATutor theme system allows administrators to easily customize the look and layout of the system to their particular needs.&lt;ref&gt;The theme system was introduced in mid-2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Themes are used to give ATutor a new look, to give categories of courses their own look, or to provide multiple versions of ATutor on a single system, from which users could choose one as a preference setting.

The privilege system allows instructors to assign tool management privileges to particular members of a course. Instructors may create assistants or course tutors that had limited control over any of the authoring or management tools.&lt;ref&gt;The privilege system was introduced early 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--
Later in 2005 tool modules were introduced into the system. Essentially, the learning tools that already existed in ATutor were separated from the core system. This allowed ATutor administrators to customize the system, deciding which learning tools would be available on the system, and which default tools would be available in a newly created course. It also allowed instructors to choose from the available tools only those that might be used in a particular course. Perhaps the most important aspect of the modules system was to allow developers to easily extend ATutor with new features. Third party programs could be integrated into the system. New tools could be created by any developer to customize the system to their particular needs. And,  ultimately,  spread the development of ATutor as a whole from its central core of developers during its early years, out into its community of users.

Groups were introduced in early 2006. Groups essentially allowed instructors to create sub-courses within a course, where he or she maintains control over the management of the larger course, but can assign course members to groups that have their own group specific versions of many of the tools available to the instructor or to the course as a whole.

== E-learning patent dispute ==
ATutor is one of three [[Open-source software|open source]] learning management systems named in a formal challenge to an e-learning patent issued to [[Blackboard Inc.]] in July 2006. The [[Software Freedom Law Center]] filed a re-examination request on behalf of ATutor, and two other clients in late 2006. In early 2007 the re-examination request was granted by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO). If successful, the request will ultimately lead to the cancellation of all 44 claims of the Blackboard patent.&lt;ref name="FreedomLaw000"&gt;For full details, see the Press Releases from The Software Freedom Law Center. [http://www.softwarefreedom.org/news/2006/nov/30/blackboard-patent-reexam-filed/] [http://www.softwarefreedom.org/news/2007/jan/25/blackboard-reexam-ordered/].&lt;/ref&gt;

In support of the challenge to the Blackboard patent, volunteers across the Internet found examples of older programs that used ideas claimed by the patent. These volunteers collaborated to make a Wikipedia article on the [[History of virtual learning environments]], which documents several examples of prior art.&lt;ref name="FreedomLaw000" /&gt;

Additionally, Greg Gay, project lead of ATutor asserted in support of the re-examination request: "A patent on an educational concept -- namely the relationship among students, instructors, and administrators -- makes no sense. Such ideas are public and have been practiced for centuries; they are not the result of research and development."&lt;ref name="FreedomLaw000" /&gt;

'''Activism''' consists of efforts to promote, impede, direct, or intervene in [[Social change|social]], [[Political campaign|political]], [[Economics|economic]], or [[Natural environment|environmental]] reform with the desire to make [[Social change|changes in society]]. Forms of activism range from writing letters to newspapers, petitioning [[elected officials]], running or contributing to a political campaign, preferential patronage (or [[boycott]]) of businesses, and demonstrative forms of activism like [[Demonstration (protest)|rallies]], [[Demonstration (people)|street marches]], [[Strike action|strikes]], [[sit-in]]s, or [[hunger strike]]s.

Activism may be performed on a day-to-day basis in a wide variety of ways, including through the creation of art ([[artivism]]), computer hacking ([[hacktivism]]), or simply in how one chooses to spend their money ([[economic activism]]). For example, the refusal to buy clothes or other merchandise from a company as a [[protest]] against the [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] by that company could be considered an expression of activism. However, the most highly visible and impactful activism often comes in the form of [[collective action]], in which numerous individuals coordinate an act of protest together in order to make a bigger impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Power in Movement: Social Movements and Contentious Politics|last=Tarrow|first=Sidney|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139076807|edition= 2nd|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=|oclc=727948411}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collective action that is purposeful, organized, and sustained over a period of time becomes known as a [[social movement]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Movements Reader: Cases and Concepts|last=Goodwin|first=Jeff|last2=Jasper|first2=James|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2009|isbn=9781405187640|edition= 2nd|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, activists have used literature, including [[pamphlet]]s, tracts, and books to disseminate their messages and attempt to persuade their readers of the [[Social justice|justice]] of their cause. Research has now begun to explore how contemporary activist groups use [[social media]] to facilitate [[civic engagement]] and collective action combining [[Politics and technology|politics with technology]].&lt;ref name="Advocacy 2.0"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Obar|first= Jonathan|title= Advocacy 2.0: An Analysis of How Advocacy Groups in the United States Perceive and Use Social Media as Tools for Facilitating Civic Engagement and Collective Action|journal= Journal of Information Policy|year= 2012|ssrn= 1956352|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Obar"&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Obar|first= Jonathan|title= Canadian Advocacy 2.0: A Study of Social Media Use by Social Movement Groups and Activists in Canada|journal= Canadian Journal of Communication|year= 2014|ssrn= 2254742}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'' records the English words "activism" and "activist" as in use in the political sense from the year 1920&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD| activism| accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1915&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD| activist| accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

==Definitions of activism==
The history of the word ''activism'' traces back to earlier understandings of [[collective behavior]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to the Science of Sociology|last=Park|first=Robert|last2=Burgess|first2=Ernest|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1921|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Theory and Social Structure|last=Merton|first=Robert|publisher=Free Press|year=1945|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The True Believer|last=Hoffer|first=Eric|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|year=1951|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Social action theory|social action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Structure of Social Action|last=Parsons|first=Talcott|publisher=Free Press|year=1937|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1969 ''activism was'' defined as "the policy or practice of doing things with decision and energy", without regard to a political signification, whereas ''social action was'' defined as "organized action taken by a group to improve social conditions", without regard to normative status. Following the surge of so-called "new social movements" in the United States in the 1960's, a new understanding of activism emerged as a rational and acceptable [[Democracy|democratic]] option of [[protest]] or appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups|last=Olson|first=Mancur|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1965|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Strategy of Social Protest|last=Gamson|first=William|publisher=Dorsey Press|year=1975|isbn=|location=Homewood, IL|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Mobilization to Revolution|last=Tilly|first=Charles|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1978|isbn=|location=Reading, Mass.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the history of the existence of revolt through organized or unified protest in recorded history dates back to the [[Slave rebellion|slave revolts]] of the 1st century BC(E) in the [[Roman Empire]], where under the leadership of former gladiator [[Spartacus]] 6,000 slaves rebelled and were crucified from Capua to [[Rome]] in what became known as the [[Third Servile War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/spartacus.htm|title=Ancient History: Spartacus and the Slave Rebellion|last=Czech|first=Kenneth P.|date=Apr 1994|website=HistoryNet|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English history, the [[Peasants' Revolt|Peasant's Revolt]] erupted in response to the imposition of a [[Poll tax riots|poll tax]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Peasants-Revolt|title=Peasants' Revolt|last=Encyclopaedia Britannica|first=Editors of|date=|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been paralleled by other rebellions and revolutions in Hungary, Russia, and more recently, for example, [[Umbrella Revolution|Hong Kong]]. In 1930 under the leadership of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] thousands of protesting Indians participated in the [[Salt March]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/event/Salt-March Salt March]. Britannica.com&lt;/ref&gt; as a protest against the oppressive taxes of their government, resulting in the imprisonment of 60,000 people and eventual independence for their nation. In nations throughout Asia, Africa and South America, the prominence of activism organized by [[social movement]]s and especially under the leadership of [[Civil and political rights|civil activists]] or social revolutionaries has pushed for increasing national self-reliance or, in some parts of the developing world, collectivist communist or socialist organization and affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991|last=Goodwin|first=Jeff|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activism has had major impacts on Western societies as well, particularly over the past century through social movements such as the [[Labour movement]], the [[Women's rights|Women's Rights movement]], and the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Movement Society: Contentious Politics for a New Century|last=Meyer|first=David|last2=Tarrow|first2=Sidney|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of activism==
Activists can function in a number of roles, including judicial, environmental, internet (technological) and design. Historically, most activism has focused on creating substantive changes in the policy or practice of a government or industry. Some activists try to persuade people to change their behavior directly (see also [[direct action]]), rather than to persuade governments to change laws. For example, the [[cooperative movement]] seeks to build new institutions which conform to cooperative principles, and generally does not lobby or protest politically. Other activists try to persuade people or government policy to remain the same, in an effort to [[Countermovement|counter change]].

Activism is not always an activity performed by those who profess activism as a profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.permanentculturenow.com/what-is-activism/|title=Introduction to Activism|work=Permanent Culture Now|publisher=Permanent Culture Now|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term activist may apply broadly to anyone who engages in activism, or be more narrowly limited to those who choose political or social activism as a vocation or characteristic practice.

=== Judicial and citizen activism ===
[[Judicial activism]] involves the efforts of public officials. [[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]] - American [[historian]], [[public intellectual]], and [[Social criticism|social critic]] - introduced the term "judicial activism" in a January 1946 [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'' magazine]] article titled "The Supreme Court: 1947".&lt;ref&gt;Keenan Kmiec in a 2004 ''California Law Review'' article&lt;/ref&gt; Activists can also be public [[Consumer organization|watchdogs]] and [[whistle blower]]s, attempting to understand all the actions of every form of government that acts in the name of the people and hold it accountable to oversight and transparency. Activism involves an engaged citizenry.&lt;ref name="pat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://health.usnews.com/health-care/for-better/articles/2017-02-27/politically-active-4-tips-for-incorporating-self-care |title=Politically Active? 4 Tips for Incorporating Self-Care, US News |date=27 February 2017 |work=US News |accessdate=5 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental activism ===
{{See also|Environmentalism|List of environmental activists assassinated}}

Environmental activism describes the actions of those who believe in protecting the Earth's natural environment. This can include a wide range of approaches.

===Internet activism===
{{Further|Internet activism|Hacktivism|Online social movement|Anonymous (group)|Digital rights|Category:Internet activism}}
The power of [[Internet Activism|Internet activism]] came into a global lens with the [[Arab Spring]] protests starting in late 2010. People living in the Middle East and North African countries that were experiencing revolutions used social networking to communicate information about protests, including videos recorded on smart phones, which put the issues in front of an international audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the one of the first occasions in which social networking technology was used by citizen-activists to circumvent state-controlled media and communicate directly with the rest of the world. These types of practices of Internet activism were later picked up and used by other activists in subsequent mass mobilizations, such as the [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15-M Movement]] in Spain in 2011, [[Gezi Park protests|Occupy Gezi]] in Turkey in 2013, and more.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest|last=Zeynep|first=Tufekci|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780300215120|location=New Haven|pages=|oclc=961312425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet activism may also refer to activism which focuses on protecting or changing the Internet itself, also known as [[digital rights]]. The Digital Rights movement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The digital rights movement : the role of technology in subverting digital copyright|last=Hector|first=Postigo|date=2012|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262305334|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=|oclc=812346336}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of activists and organizations, such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], who work to protect the rights of people in relation to new technologies, particularly concerning the Internet and other [[Information and communications technology|information and communications technologies]].

=== Activism in literature ===
Activism in literature (not to be confused with [[literary activism]]) includes the expression of intended or advocated reforms, realized or unachieved, through published, written or verbally promoted or communicated forms.

=== Economic activism ===
[[Economic activism]] involves using economic power for change. Both conservative and liberal groups use economic activism to as a form of pressure to influence companies and organizations to oppose or support particular political, religious, or social values and behaviors. This is typically done either through preferential [[patronage]] to reinforce "good" behavior and support companies one would like to succeed, or through [[boycott]] or [[divestment]] to penalize "bad" behavior and pressure companies to change or go out of business.

[[Consumer activism]] consists of activism carried out on behalf of [[consumer]]s for [[consumer protection]] or by consumers themselves. For example, activists in the [[free produce movement]] of the late 1700s protested against [[slavery]] by boycotting goods produced with slave labor. Today, [[vegetarianism]], [[veganism]], and [[freeganism]] are all forms of consumer activism which boycott certain types of products. Other examples of consumer activism include [[simple living]], a minimalist lifestyle intended to reduce [[Economic materialism|materialism]] and [[conspicuous consumption]], and [[tax resistance]], a form of [[direct action]] and [[civil disobedience]] in opposition to the government that is imposing the tax, to government policy, or as [[Taxation as theft|opposition to taxation in itself]].

[[Activist shareholder|Shareholder activism]] involves [[shareholder]]s using an [[Equity (finance)|equity]] stake in a [[corporation]] to put pressure on its [[management]].&lt;ref&gt;Reasonable Investor(s), Boston University Law Review, available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2579510&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of activist shareholders range from financial (increase of [[shareholder value]] through changes in corporate policy, financing structure, cost cutting, etc.) to non-financial ([[disinvestment]] from particular countries, adoption of [[environmentalism|environmentally friendly]] policies, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Carried Interest: "Activist Investor Definition" [https://www.carriedin.com/activist-investor/]. Retrieved 17 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PeacePark.jpg|thumb|right|The longest running [[White House Peace Vigil|peace vigil]] in U.S. history, started by activist [[Thomas (activist)|Thomas]] in 1981.]]

Activists employ many different methods, or tactics, in pursuit of their goals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Decisions over what tactics to use or not may be planned carefully in advance, result from negotiations with law enforcement such as when and where to hold a rally, or be made in the heat of the moment. The tactics chosen are significant because they can determine how activists are perceived and what they are capable of accomplishing. For example, nonviolent tactics generally tend to garner more public sympathy than violent ones&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nonviolent Social Movements: A Geographical Perspective|last=Zunes|first=Stephen|last2=Asher|first2=Sarah Beth|last3=Kurtz|first3=Lester|date=1999|publisher=Blackwell|others=|isbn=978-1577180753|location=Malden, Mass.|pages=|oclc=40753886}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are more than twice as effective in achieving stated goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict|last=Chenoweth|first=Erica|last2=Stephan|first2=Maria J.|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780231156837|edition= |location=New York|pages=|oclc=810145714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Tilly]] developed the concept of a “[[repertoire of contention]],” which describes the full range of tactics available to activists at a given time and place.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contentious Politics|last=Tilly|first=Charles|last2=Tarrow|first2=Sidney|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=|year=2015|isbn=9780190255053|edition= Second revised |location=New York, NY|pages=|oclc=909883395}}&lt;/ref&gt; This repertoire consists of all of the tactics which have been proven to be successful by activists in the past, such as boycotts, petitions, marches, and sit-ins, and can be drawn upon by any new activists and social movements. Activists may also innovate new tactics of protest. These may be entirely novel, such as Douglas Schuler's idea of an "activist road trip",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Liberating Voices: A Pattern Language for Communication Revolution|last1=Schuler|first1=Douglas|date=2008|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262693660|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicsphereproject.org/content/activist-road-trip|title=Activist Road Trip|date=2008|website=Public Sphere Project|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or may occur in response to police [[oppression]] or [[countermovement]] resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McAdam|first=Doug|date=1983|title=Tactical Innovation and the Pace of Insurgency|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=48|issue=6|pages=735–754|doi=10.2307/2095322|jstor=2095322}}&lt;/ref&gt; New tactics then spread to others through a social process known as [[Diffusion of innovations|diffusion]], and if successful, may become new additions to the activist repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ayres|first=Jeffrey M.|date=1999|title=From the Streets to the Internet: The Cyber-Diffusion of Contention|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|language=|volume=566|issue=1|pages=132–143|doi=10.1177/000271629956600111|issn=0002-7162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many contemporary activists now utilize new tactics through the [[Internet]] and other [[Information and communication technologies for development|information and communication technologies (ICTs)]], also known as [[Internet activism]] or cyber-activism. Some scholars argue that many of these new tactics are digitally analogous to the traditional offline tools of contention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Future Active: Media Activism and the Internet|last=Meikle|first=Graham|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1864031485|location=Annandale, N.S.W.|pages=|oclc=50165391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other digital tactics may be entire new and unique, such as certain types of [[hacktivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hacktivism and the Future of Political Participation|last=Samuel|first=Alexandra|publisher=Doctoral Dissertation|year=2004|isbn=|location=Harvard University|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Together they form a new "digital repertoire of contention" alongside the existing offline one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digitally Enabled Social Change: Activism in the Internet Age|last=Earl|first=Jennifer|last2=Kimport|first2=Katrina|publisher=MIT Press|others=|year=2011|isbn=9780262295352|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=|oclc=727948420}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rising use of digital tools and platforms by activists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rolfe|first=Brett|date=2005|title=Building an Electronic Repertoire of Contention|journal=Social Movement Studies|language=|volume=4|issue=1|pages=65–74|doi=10.1080/14742830500051945|issn=1474-2837|citeseerx=10.1.1.457.9077}}&lt;/ref&gt; has also increasingly led to the creation of decentralized networks of activists that are self-organized&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuchs|first=Christian|date=2006|title=The Self-Organization of Social Movements|journal=Systemic Practice and Action Research|language=|volume=19|issue=1|pages=101–137|doi=10.1007/s11213-005-9006-0|issn=1094-429X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing without Organizations|last=Clay|first=Shirky|publisher=Penguin Press|year=2008|isbn=9781594201530|location=New York|pages=|oclc=168716646}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Networks of Outrage and Hope: Social Movements in the Internet Age|last=Castells|first=Manuel|publisher=Polity|year=2015|isbn=9780745695754|edition= 2nd|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=|oclc=896126968}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Leaderless resistance|leaderless]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Leaderless Revolution: How Ordinary People will Take Power and Change Politics in the 21st Century|last=Carne|first=Ross|publisher=Plume|year=2013|isbn=9780452298941|location=New York|pages=|oclc=795168105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; or what is known as [[franchise activism]].

==Activism industry==
Some groups and organizations participate in activism to such an extent that it can be considered as an industry. In these cases, activism is often done full-time, as part of an organization's [[core business]]. Many organizations in the activism industry are either [[non profit|non-profit organizations]] or [[non-governmental organization]]s with specific aims and objectives in mind. Most activist organizations do not manufacture goods,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} but rather mobilized personnel to recruit funds and gain media coverage.

The term ''activism industry'' has often been used to refer to outsourced [[fundraising]] operations. However, activist organizations engage in other activities as well.&lt;ref&gt;Dana R. Fisher, "[http://prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=11993 The Activism Industry: The Problem with the Left's Model of Outsourced Grassroots Canvassing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205162211/http://prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=11993 |date=5 December 2010 }}", ''[[The American Prospect]]'', 14 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lobbying]], or the influencing of decisions made by government, is another activist tactic. Many groups, including law firms, have designated staff assigned specifically for lobbying purposes. In the United States, lobbying is regulated by the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110711095632/http://www.gklaw.com/publication.cfm?publication_id=724 New Federal Lobbying Law Reporting Periods Begin]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many government systems encourage public support of non-profit organizations by granting various forms of [[income tax|tax]] relief for donations to [[charitable organization]]s. Governments may attempt to deny these benefits to activists by restricting the political activity of tax-exempt organizations.

'''Albert Ellis''' (September 27, 1913 – July 24, 2007) was an American [[psychologist]] who in 1955 developed [[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]] (REBT). He held MA and PhD degrees in [[clinical psychology]] from [[Columbia University]] and the [[American Board of Professional Psychology]] (ABPP). He also founded and was the President of the New York City-based Albert Ellis Institute for decades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albertellisinstitute.org/ Albert Ellis Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; He is generally considered to be one of the originators of the [[cognitive revolution]]ary paradigm shift in [[psychotherapy]] and one of the founders of [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral therapies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knapp|first=Paulo|last2=Beck|first2=Aaron T.|date=2008|title=Cognitive therapy: foundations, conceptual models, applications and research|url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rbp/v30s2/en_a02v30s2.pdf|journal=[[Revista Brasileira de Psiquiatria]]|volume=30(Suppl II)|pages=54–64|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Based on a 1982 professional survey of US and Canadian psychologists, he was considered as the second most influential psychotherapist in history ([[Carl Rogers]] ranked first in the survey; [[Sigmund Freud]] was ranked third).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/nyregion/10ellis.html New York Times: Despite Illness and Lawsuits, a Famed Psychotherapist Is Temporarily Back in Session] December 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = D. | title = Trends in counseling and psychotherapy | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.37.7.802 | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 37 | issue = 7 | pages = 802–809 | year = 1982 | pmid =  7137698| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Psychology Today]]'' noted, "No individual—not even Freud himself—has had a greater impact on modern psychotherapy."&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, R. (2001). "The Prince of Reason".  Psychology Today.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ellis was born to a Jewish family in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, US, in 1913. He was the eldest of three children. Ellis' father was a businessman, often away from home on business trips, who reportedly showed only a modicum of affection to his children.

In his autobiography, Ellis characterized his mother as a self-absorbed woman with a [[bipolar disorder]]. At times, according to Ellis, she was a "bustling chatterbox who never listened." She would expound on her strong opinions on most subjects, but rarely provided a factual basis for these views. Like his father, Ellis' mother was emotionally distant from her children. Ellis recounted that she was often sleeping when he left for school and usually not home when he returned. Instead of reporting feeling bitter, he took on the responsibility of caring for his siblings. He purchased an alarm clock with his own money and woke and dressed his younger brother and sister. When the [[Great Depression]] struck, all three children sought work to assist the family. Ellis was sickly as a child and suffered numerous health problems throughout his youth. At the age of five he was hospitalized with a [[kidney disease]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;New York Times: [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/25/nyregion/25ellis.html Albert Ellis, Influential Psychotherapist, Dies at 93]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also hospitalized with [[tonsillitis]], which led to a severe [[Group A streptococcal infection|streptococcal infection]] requiring emergency surgery. He reported that he had eight hospitalizations between the ages of five and seven, one of which lasted nearly a year. His parents provided little emotional support for him during these years, rarely visiting or consoling him. Ellis stated that he learned to confront his adversities as he had "developed a growing indifference to that dereliction". Illness was to follow Ellis throughout his life; at age 40 he developed [[diabetes]].&lt;ref name="REBT Interview"&gt;psychotherapy.net: [http://www.psychotherapy.net/interview/Albert_Ellis An Interview with Albert Ellis, PhD Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225020622/http://www.psychotherapy.net/interview/Albert_Ellis |date=December 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis had exaggerated fears of speaking in public and during his adolescence, he was extremely shy around women. At age 19, already showing signs of thinking like a cognitive-behavioral therapist, he forced himself to talk to 100 women in the [[Bronx Botanical Gardens]] over a period of a month. Even though he did not get a date, he reported that he desensitized himself to his fear of rejection by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Control-Your-Anxiety-Before-Controls/dp/0806521368|title=How To Control Your Anxiety Before It Controls You|first=Albert|last=Ellis|date=August 1, 2000|publisher=Citadel|accessdate=April 4, 2018|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and early career==
Ellis entered the field of [[clinical psychology]] after first earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in business from what was then known as the [[Baruch College|City College of New York Downtown]] in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/magazine/documents/Baruch-Winter07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He began a brief career in business, followed by one as a writer. These endeavors took place during the [[Great Depression]] that began in 1929, and Ellis found that business was poor and had no success in publishing his fiction. Finding that he could write non-fiction well, Ellis researched and wrote on [[human sexuality]]. His lay counseling in this subject convinced him to seek a new career in [[clinical psychology]].

In 1942, Ellis began his studies for a PhD in clinical psychology at [[Teachers College, Columbia University]], which trained psychologists mostly in [[psychoanalysis]]. He completed his Master of Arts in clinical psychology from Teachers College in June 1943, and started a part-time private practice while still working on his PhD degree—possibly because there was no licensing of psychologists in New York at that time. Ellis began publishing articles even before receiving his PhD; in 1946 he wrote a critique of many widely used pencil-and-paper [[personality test]]s. He concluded that only the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] met the standards of a research-based instrument.

In 1947, he was awarded a PhD in Clinical Psychology at Columbia, and at that time Ellis had come to believe that psychoanalysis was the deepest and most effective form of therapy. Like most psychologists of that time, he was interested in the theories of [[Sigmund Freud]]. He sought additional training in psychoanalysis and then began to practice classical psychoanalysis. Shortly after receiving his PhD in 1947, Ellis began a Jungian analysis and program of supervision with [[Richard Hulbeck]], a leading analyst at the Karen Horney Institute (whose own analyst had been [[Hermann Rorschach]], the developer of the [[Rorschach inkblot test]]). At that time he taught at [[New York University]], [[Rutgers University]], and [[Pittsburg State University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.newpaltz.edu/news/2002/04/founder-of-rational-emotive-behavioral-therapy-to-speak-about-coping-with-disasters-at-suny-new-paltz/|title=Founder of rational emotive behavioral therapy to speak about coping with disasters at SUNY New Paltz – SUNY New Paltz News|author=|date=|website=sites.newpaltz.edu|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and held a couple of leading staff positions. At this time, Ellis' faith in psychoanalysis was gradually crumbling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rebt.ws/albertellisbiography.html|title=Albert Ellis Biography by Dr. Mike and Dr. Lidia Abrams|author=|date=|website=www.rebt.ws|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early theoretical contributions to psychotherapy==
The writings of [[Karen Horney]], [[Alfred Adler]], [[Erich Fromm]] and [[Harry Stack Sullivan]] would be some of the influences in Ellis's thinking and played a role in shaping his psychological models. Ellis credits [[Alfred Korzybski]],&lt;ref&gt;Ellis A. (1991). General semantics and rational-emotive therapy: 1991 Alfred Korzybski Memorial Lecture. Institute of General Semantics&lt;/ref&gt; his book, ''Science and Sanity'',&lt;ref&gt;Korzybski A. (1933). Science and Sanity. Institute of General Semantics, 1994, {{ISBN|0-937298-01-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[general semantics]] for starting him on the philosophical path for founding rational therapy. In addition, modern and ancient philosophy (particularly [[stoicism]]), and his own experiences heavily influenced his new theoretical developments to psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="A Sketch of Albert Ellis"&gt;Albert Ellis institute: [http://albertellis.org/about-albert-ellis-phd/ A Sketch of Albert Ellis]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430221521/http://www.albertellisinstitute.org/aei/albert_ellis_bio.html |date=April 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis acknowledged that his therapy was "by no means entirely new", as in particular [[Paul Charles Dubois]]'s "rational persuasion" had prefigured some of its main principals; Ellis stated he had read him some years after inventing his therapy, but had studied [[Émile Coué]] since a young age.&lt;ref name="Robertson_2010"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Robertson, D | title=The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy: Stoicism as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy| page=19| year=2010| publisher=Karnac| location=London| isbn=978-1-85575-756-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsOFyJaR5vEC&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1940s onwards, Ellis worked on [[Rational emotive behavior therapy|rational emotive behavioral therapy]] (REBT), and by January 1953 his break with psychoanalysis was complete, and he began calling himself a rational therapist. Ellis was now advocating a new more active and directive type of psychotherapy. In 1955, he presented rational therapy (RT). In RT, the therapist sought to help the client understand—and act on the understanding—that his personal philosophy contained beliefs that contributed to his own emotional pain. This new approach stressed actively working to change a client's self-defeating beliefs and behaviours by demonstrating their irrationality, self-defeatism and rigidity. Ellis believed that through [[Rationality|rational analysis]] and [[cognitive]] reconstruction, people could understand their self-defeatingness in light of their core irrational beliefs and then develop more rational constructs.

In 1954, Ellis began teaching his new techniques to other therapists, and by 1957, he formally set forth the first [[cognitive behavior therapy]] by proposing that therapists help people adjust their thinking and behavior as the treatment for emotional and behavioral problems. Two years later, Ellis published ''How to Live with a Neurotic'', which elaborated on his new method. In 1960, Ellis presented a paper on his new approach at the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) convention in Chicago. There was mild interest, but few recognized that the paradigm set forth would become the [[zeitgeist]] within a generation. At that time, the prevailing interest in experimental psychology was [[behaviorism]], while in [[clinical psychology]] it was the psychoanalytic schools of notables such as Freud, [[Carl Jung|Jung]], Adler, and [[Fritz Perls|Perls]]. Despite the fact that Ellis' approach emphasized cognitive, emotive, and behavioral methods, his strong cognitive emphasis provoked the psychotherapeutic establishment with the possible exception of the followers of Adler. Consequently, he was often received with significant hostility at professional conferences and in print.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Mike and Dr. Lidia Abrams: [http://www.rebt.ws/albertellisbiography.html A Brief Biography of Dr. Albert Ellis 1913–2007]&lt;/ref&gt; He regularly held seminars where he would bring a participant up on stage and treat them. His own therapeutical style was famed for often being delivered in a rough, confrontational style; however, it should not be confused with his rational-emotive and cognitive-behavioral therapy school that is practiced by his students and followers in a large variety of therapeutic styles (e.g., often depending on client's personality, client's clinical problem, and evidence-based information regarding the appropriate intervention, but also including therapist's own preference).

Despite the relative slow adoption of his approach in the beginning, Ellis founded his own institute. The Institute for Rational Living was founded as a non-profit organization in 1959. By 1968, it was chartered by the New York State [[Board of Regents]] as a training institute and psychological clinic.

==Rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT)==
Ellis published his first major book on [[Rational emotive behavior therapy|Rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT)]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Ellis, A. | title=Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy| year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; REBT is an active-directive, [[philosophy|philosophically]] and [[empirical]]ly based [[psychotherapy]], the aim of which is to resolve [[emotion]]al and [[behavior]]al problems and disturbances and to help people to lead happier and more fulfilling lives.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, A.

Sarasota, FL: Professional Resource Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integrity assessment studies ==
In 1979 and during the next two decades Ellis focuses part of his research on behavioral integrity through applied experimental psychology, focusing on [[Human reliability|reliability]], [[honesty]] and [[loyalty]] as psychosocial behavior. [[Organizational commitment]] as a cognitive norm, evaluating concretely through images developed in his Institute.

In his book ''Personality Theories''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality Theories|last=Ellis|first=Albert|publisher=SAGE|year=2009|isbn=9781412914222|location=United States of America|pages=Cap 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed with [[Mike Abrams (psychologist)|Mike Abrams]] and [https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/author/lidia-dengelegi-abrams Lidia Dengelegi Abrams] establish the opinions of evaluation of integrity understanding the reason of each personality can have a change in their attitude, reliability is the common factor of their samples taken and of the which great advances were obtained to look for a tool to work with the human mind.

==Work as sexologist and sex and love researcher==
By the 1960s, Ellis had come to be seen as one of the founders of the [[Sexual revolution in 1960s America|American sexual revolution]]. Especially in his earlier career, he was well known for his work as a sexologist and for his liberal [[Humanism|humanistic]], and in some camps controversial&lt;ref&gt;Elis A. (2009) Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy: It Works for Me - It Can Work for You, 2009, {{ISBN|1-59102-184-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; opinions on human sexuality. He also worked with noted [[zoologist]] and sex researcher [[Alfred Kinsey]] and explored in a number of books and articles the topic of human sexuality and love. Sex and love relations were his professional interests even from the beginning of his career. [[Norman Haire]], in his preface to Ellis' 1952 book ''Sex Beliefs and Customs'', applauded the work of the Society for the Prevention of Venereal Disease while he ridiculed its rival, the National Council for Combating Venereal Disease, who argued that preventive measures such as [[condoms]] would encourage vice: Haire called them "the Society for the Prevention of the Prevention of Venereal Disease".&lt;ref&gt;Diana Wyndham. (2012){{cite web|url= http://purl.library.usyd.edu.au/sup/9781743320068|title='Norman Haire and the Study of Sex'}} Foreword by the Hon. [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Michael Kirby]] AC CMG. (Sydney: {{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/sup/|title=Sydney University Press}}, p.395&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Ellis published his classic work ''Sex Without Guilt'' which came to be known for its advocacy of a liberal attitude towards sex. He contributed to [[Paul Krassner]]'s magazine ''[[The Realist]]''; among its articles, in 1964 he wrote ''if this be heresy... Is pornography harmful to children?''&lt;ref&gt;Albert Ellis, Ph.D. (1964) [http://www.ep.tc/realist/47/17.html ''if this be heresy... Is pornography harmful to children?''], in ''[[The Realist]]'' No.47 pp.17-8, 23&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, Ellis published a book entitled ''Homosexuality: Its Causes and Cure'', which partly saw [[homosexuality]] as a pathology and therefore a condition to be cured. In 1973, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] reversed its position on homosexuality by declaring that it was not a mental disorder and thus not properly subject to cure, and in 1976, Ellis clarified his earlier views in ''Sex and the Liberated Man'', expounding that some homosexual disturbed behaviors may be subject to treatment but, in most cases, that should not be attempted as homosexuality is not inherently good or evil, except from a religious viewpoint (See "Ellis and religion", below). Near the end of his life, he finally updated and re-wrote ''Sex Without Guilt'' in 2001 and released as ''Sex Without Guilt in the Twenty-First Century''. In this book, he expounded and enhanced his humanistic view on sexual ethics and morality and dedicated a chapter on homosexuality to giving homosexuals advice and suggestion on how to more greatly enjoy and enhance their sexual love lives. While preserving some of the ideas about human sexuality from the original, the revision described his later humanistic opinions and ethical ideals as they had evolved in his academic work and practice.

==Ellis and religion==
In his original version of his book ''Sex Without Guilt'', Ellis expressed the opinion that religious restrictions on sexual expression are often needless and harmful to emotional health. He also famously debated religious psychologists, including [[Orval Hobart Mowrer]] and [[Allen Bergin]], over the proposition that religion often contributed to psychological distress. Because of his forthright espousal of a nontheistic humanism, he was recognized in 1971 as Humanist of the Year by the [[American Humanist Association]]. By 2003, he was one of the signers of the [[Humanism and Its Aspirations|Humanist Manifesto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers |title=Notable Signers |publisher=American Humanist Association |work=Humanism and Its Aspirations |accessdate=September 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005105825/http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers |archivedate=October 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis most recently described himself as a [[Spectrum of theistic probability|probabilistic]] [[atheist]], meaning that while he acknowledged that he could not be completely certain there is no god, he believed the probability a god exists was so small that it was not worth his or anyone else's attention.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Stevan Lars &amp; Ellis, Albert. (1994). A discussion with Albert Ellis: Reason, emotion and religion, ''Journal of Psychology and Christianity'', ''13''(4), Win 1994. pp. 327–341&lt;/ref&gt;

While Ellis' personal atheism and humanism remained consistent, his views about the role of religion in mental health changed over time. In early comments delivered at conventions and at his institute in New York City, Ellis overtly and often with characteristically acerbic delivery stated that devout religious beliefs and practices were harmful to mental health. In "The Case Against Religiosity", a 1980 pamphlet published by his New York institute, he offered an idiosyncratic definition of religiosity as any devout, dogmatic and demanding belief. He noted that religious codes and religious individuals often manifest religiosity, but added that devout, demanding religiosity is also obvious among many orthodox psychotherapists and psychoanalysts, devout political believers and aggressive atheists.

Ellis was careful to state that REBT was independent of his atheism, noting that many skilled REBT practitioners are religious, including some who are ordained ministers. In his later days, he significantly toned down his opposition to religion. While Ellis maintained his firm atheistic stance, proposing that thoughtful, probabilistic atheism was likely the most emotionally healthy approach to life, he acknowledged and agreed with survey evidence suggesting that belief in a loving God can also be psychologically healthy.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis A. (2000). Can rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) be effectively used with people who have devout beliefs in God and religion?. ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, 31(1)'', Feb 2000. pp. 29–33&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this later approach to religion, he reformulated his professional and personal view in one of his last books ''The Road to Tolerance'', and he also co-authored a book, ''Counseling and Psychotherapy with Religious Persons: A Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy Approach,'' with two religious psychologists, Stevan Lars Nielsen and W. Brad Johnson, describing principles for integrating religious material and beliefs with REBT during treatment of religious clients.

Ellis was a lifelong advocate for peace and an opponent of militarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.uci.edu/quest/index.php?page=ellis|title=Page No Longer Available - UC Irvine Libraries|author=|date=|website=www.lib.uci.edu|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peace.maripo.com/p_peacemakers.htm|title=1,493 Notable Peacemakers Throughout History|author=|date=|website=peace.maripo.com|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://albert-ellis-friends.net/|title=Index|author=|date=|website=albert-ellis-friends.net|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

===Professional contributions===
While many of his ideas were criticized during the 1950s and '60s by the psychotherapeutic establishment, his reputation grew immensely in the subsequent decades. From the 1960s on, his prominence was steadily growing as the [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavioral therapies]] (CBT) were gaining further theoretical and scientific ground.&lt;ref name="yankura"&gt;Yankura J. &amp; Dryden W. (1994). ''Albert Ellis''. SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt; From then, CBT gradually became one of the most popular systems of psychotherapy in many countries, mainly due to the large body of rigorously conducted research that underpinned the work of the [[cognitive therapy]] school (a key part of the CBT family) founded by [[Aaron T. Beck]]. In the late 1960s, his institute launched a professional journal, and in the early 70s established "The Living School" for children between 6 and 13. The school provided a curriculum that incorporated the principles of RE(B)T. Despite its relative short life, interest groups generally expressed satisfaction with its programmer.&lt;ref name="yankura" /&gt; Many schools of psychological thought became influenced by Albert Ellis, including [[Rational Behavior Therapy]] created by a student of his, [[Maxie Clarence Maultsby, Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maultsby, M.C. Jr. |author2=Ellis, A. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Techniques for Using Rational-Emotive Imagery (REI)|year=1974|publisher=New York: Institute for Rational Living|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ellis had such an impact that in a 1982 [[statistical survey|survey]], American and Canadian clinical psychologists and counsellors ranked him ahead of Freud when asked to name the figure who had exerted the average influence on their field. Also in 1982, in an analysis of psychology journals published in the US it was found that Ellis was the most cited author after 1957.&lt;ref name="yankura" /&gt; In 1985, the APA presented Dr. Ellis with its award for "distinguished professional contributions".

He held many important positions in many professional societies including the Division of Consulting Psychology of the APA, Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality, American Association of Marital and Family Therapy, the American Academy of Psychotherapists and the American Association of Sex Educators, Counsellors, and Therapists. In addition Ellis also served as consulting or associate editor of many [[scientific journal]]s. Many professional societies gave Ellis their highest professional and clinical awards.

In the mid-1990s, he renamed his psychotherapy and behavior change system rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT). (It was originally known as rational therapy and then rational-emotive therapy.)  This he did to stress the interrelated importance of cognition, emotion and behaviour in his therapeutic approach. In 1994, he also updated and revised his original, 1962 classic book, ''Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy''.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis A. Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy, Revised Edition, 1994, {{ISBN|1559722487}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the remainder of his life, he continued developing the theory that cognition, emotion and behaviour are intertwined, and that a system for psychotherapy and behaviour change must involve all three.

===Public appearance===
Ellis's work extended into areas other than psychology, including education, politics, business and philosophy. He eventually became a prominent and confrontational social commenter and public speaker on a wide array of issues. During his career he publicly debated a vast number of people who represented opposing views to his; this included for example debates with psychologist [[Nathaniel Branden]] on [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]] on the topic of [[mental illness]]. On numerous occasions he critiqued opposing psychotherapeutic approaches, and questioned some of the doctrines in certain dogmatic religious systems, i.e.:[[spiritualism]] and [[mysticism]].

From 1965 until the end of his life he led his famous Friday Night Workshops, in which he conducted therapy sessions with volunteers from the audience. The 1970s found him introducing his popular "rational humorous songs" which combined humorous lyrics with a rational self-help message set to a popular tune. Ellis also held workshops and seminars on mental health and psychotherapy all over the world until his 90s.

===Final years===
Until he fell ill at the age of 92 in 2006, Ellis typically worked at least 16 hours a day, writing books in longhand on legal tablets, visiting with clients, and teaching. On his 90th birthday in 2003, he received congratulatory messages from well-known public figures such as then-President [[George W. Bush]], New York senators [[Charles Schumer]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], former President [[Bill Clinton]], New York City Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]], and the [[Dalai Lama]], who sent a silk scarf blessed for the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Recollection of Stevan Lars Nielsen, Ph.D. who was present at the 90th birthday party&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New Yorker: [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/10/13/031013ta_talk_green The Human Condition – Ageless, Guiltless]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Ellis was taken ill with serious intestinal problems, which led to hospitalization and the removal of his [[large intestine]]. He returned to work after a few months of supportive care.

In 2005, he was removed from all professional duties and from the board of his own institute after a dispute over the management policies of the institute. Ellis was reinstated to the board in January 2006 after winning civil proceedings against the board members who removed him.&lt;ref&gt;NY Courts: [http://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2006/2006_26023.htm Ellis v Broder (2006 NY Slip Op 26023)]&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, 2007, lawyers acting for Albert Ellis filed a suit against the Albert Ellis Institute in New York state court. The suit alleges a breach of a long-term contract with the AEI and sought recovery of the 45 East 65th Street property through the imposition of a constructive trust.&lt;ref&gt;William Knaus, Jon Geis, Ed Garcia.  [http://www.rebtnetwork.org/aei/documents/dot.html A Message in Support of Dr. Albert Ellis from Three Former Directors of Training of the Albert Ellis Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328081350/http://www.rebtnetwork.org/aei/documents/dot.html |date=March 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his series of health issues and profound hearing loss, Ellis never stopped working with the assistance of his wife, Australian psychologist Debbie Joffe Ellis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debbiejoffeellis.com|title=Home - Dr. Debbie Joffe Ellis|author=|date=|website=www.debbiejoffeellis.com|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2006, Ellis was hospitalized with [[pneumonia]], and spent more than a year shuttling between hospital and a rehabilitation facility. He eventually returned to his residence on the top floor of the Albert Ellis Institute where he died on July 24, 2007 in his wife's arms. Ellis had authored and co-authored more than 80 books and 1200 articles (including eight hundred scientific papers) during his lifetime. He died aged 93.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;

During his final years he worked on his only college textbook with longtime collaborator [[Mike Abrams (psychologist)|Mike Abrams]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychology.ws/|title=Psychologists NJ - Dr. Mike Abrams and Dr. Lidia D. Abrams - New Jersey Psychologists in Psychology for NJ, LLC|first=Dr.|last=Abrams|date=|website=www.psychology.ws|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he co-authored 3 books along with several research articles and chapters, including the textbook ''Personality Theories: Critical Perspectives''.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, A. &amp; Abrams, M. (2008) presented a completed Rational Emotive theory of personality. Personality Theories: Critical Perspectives. Thousand Oaks, Ca.:Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis' penultimate book was an autobiography entitled "''All Out!''" published by [[Prometheus Books]] in June 2010.  The book was dedicated to and included contributions by his wife, Dr Debbie Joffe Ellis, to whom he entrusted the legacy of REBT. In early 2011, the book ''Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy'' by Albert and Debbie Joffe Ellis was released by the American Psychological Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Albert|title=Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy|year=2011|publisher=American Psychological Association|isbn=1433809613|author2=Debbie Joffe Ellis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book explains the essentials of the theory of REBT for students and practitioners of psychology as well as for the general public.

In eulogy of Albert Ellis, APA past president [[Frank Farley (psychologist)|Frank Farley]] states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Psychology has had only of a handful of legendary figures who not only command attention across much of the discipline but also receive high recognition from the public for their work. Albert Ellis was such a figure, known inside and outside of psychology for his astounding originality, his provocative ideas, and his provocative personality. He bestrode the practice of psychotherapy like a colossus…&lt;ref&gt;Farley, F. (2009).  Albert Ellis (1913–2007). American Psychologist, Vol 64(3), pp. 215–216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the opening ceremony of the 2013 American Psychological Association Convention, Ellis was posthumously awarded the APA Award For Outstanding Lifetime Contributions to Psychology. It highlights the profound and historic role played in the life and evolution of the fields of psychology and psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;September 2013 edition of the American Psychological Association's "Monitor on Psychology" journal, Volume 44, No. 8, Page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Fellow psychologists often criticized Ellis for his weak tone and for not offering any evidence to back his views on psychotherapy.&lt;ref name=opplll&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/aug/11/guardianobituaries.usa|title=Obituary: Albert Ellis|first=Oliver|last=Burkeman|date=August 10, 2007|website=the Guardian|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his obituary in the British newspaper ''The Guardian'', it was noted that others, such as [[Aaron T. Beck]], had conducted more rigorous testing than what Ellis was willing to undertake and were able to better advance [[cognitive therapy]].&lt;ref name=opplll /&gt; His approach to treatment of severe depression was also criticized as suggesting simplistic things like "pull your socks up."&lt;ref name=opplll /&gt;

==Philosophical works==
''The Road To Tolerance'' (Prometheus Books, 2004) explains the philosophies underlying REBT - particularly an attitude of tolerance - and relates it to many religious, philosophical and social movements.

==Autobiographical works==
Most of the books Ellis wrote after inventing REBT had a strong autobiographical element. He used anecdotes from his personal life to explain how the insights of REBT occurred to him and how they helped him cope with personal problems such as shyness, anger and chronic illness.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, A. (2003) Ask Albert Ellis. Atascadero, CA: Impact Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis, A. 1994"&gt;Ellis, A. (1994) Reason and Emotion is Psychotherapy. New York, NY: Citadel Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, A. (1998)Optimal Aging: Get Over Getting Older. Chicago, IL: Open Court Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt; He also used anecdotes from client sessions to illustrate how his therapy worked.&lt;ref name="Ellis, A. 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, A. (1980) Growth Through Reason. Chatsworth CA: Wilshire Book Company&lt;/ref&gt; Two of Ellis last books were explicitly autobiographical. ''Rational-Emotive Behavior Therapy: It Works for Me -- It Can Work for You'' (Prometheus Books, 2004) recounts his early life and crises in an unusually candid way. It illustrates the way he handled his problems, at first through philosophy, and later through the application of his emerging therapeutic skills and insights. ''All Out!: An Autobiography'' (Prometheus Books, 2009) —published after his death—is a more traditional narrative of his life and work (though it also meant to be an inspirational story of the use of rational thinking in self-help).

'''Australian Bibliographic Network''' is a national shared library cataloguing network that commenced in 1981 in Australia.

==Early stage==
The [[National Library of Australia]] began investigating the potential for a national shared cataloguing network in the 1970s.  In August 1978, following a feasibility study,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=National Library of Australia | title=Bibdata network : draft proposal for an Australian national shared cataloguing system | publication-date=1976 | publisher=National Library of Australia | isbn=978-0-642-99077-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the library announced a pilot project.&lt;ref name="LA our history"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/librariesaustralia/about/history/|website=Libraries Australia|publisher=National Library of Australia|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Australian Bibliographic Network (ABN) commenced operations in November 1981.&lt;ref name="LA our history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=National Library of Australia | author2=Australian Bibliographic Network | title=Draft proposal for the development of an Australian Bibliographic Network | publication-date=1981 | publisher=National Library of Australia | isbn=978-0-642-99217-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cathro91&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cathro|first1=Warwick S|title=The Australian Bibliographic Network: A Survey of its First Decade|journal=Australian Academic &amp; Research Libraries|date=January 1991|volume=22|issue=4|pages=37–52|doi=10.1080/00048623.1991.10754736}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Bryan, Harrison | title=The development of the Australian Bibliographical Network. -Mollie Thomson Memorial Lecture, 9 October 1981- | journal=Cataloguing Australia | publication-date=1982 | volume=8 | issue=Mar 1982 | pages=2–18 | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/39211803 | accessdate=11 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ABN system was as a multi-sector network, including university, state, public and special libraries.&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au"&gt;http://www.nla.gov.au/librariesaustralia/about/history/  Development of ABN&lt;/ref&gt; Services to school libraries were provided under a separate national service, the [[Schools Catalogue Information Service|Schools Catalogue Information Service (SCIS)]], first developed in 1984 as ASCIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spence-Richards|first1=Pamela|last2=Wiegand|first2=Wayne|last3=Dalbello|first3=Marija|title=A History of Modern Librarianship: Constructing the Heritage of Western Cultures|date=2015|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=9781440834738|pages=191–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various state library systems joined the network within the next few years &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article126905722 |title=Victoria joins library network. |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=28 June 1982 |accessdate=8 December 2014 |page=12 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article136916731 |title=Library network progresses rapidly. |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=17 September 1984 |accessdate=8 December 2014 |page=14 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Conference==
The first ABN conference was conducted in 1983 &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | authors=ABN Conference (1st : 1983 : Melbourne, Vic.), National Library of Australia | title=First ABN conference, 12-14 July 1983, Melbourne | publication-date=1983 | publisher=National Library of Australia | isbn=978-0-642-99302-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Library==
The [[National Library of Australia]] established an advisory body, the ''ABN Network Committee'' (now ''Libraries Australia Advisory Committee'') to advise the Library on the operation and development of the service.&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au"/&gt;

==Database==
The database for the service is known as the ''Australian National Bibliographic Database'' (ANBD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=National Library of Australia | author2=Australian Library Collections Task Force | title=National Bibliographic Database survey July 1999 | publication-date=1999 | publisher=National Library of Australia | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/32764687 | accessdate=8 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Rajapatirana, Bemal | author2=Missingham, Roxanne | title=The Australian National Bibliographic Database and the Functional Requirements for the Bibliographic Database (FRBR) | journal=The Australian Library Journal | publication-date=2005-02-01 | publisher=Australian Library and Information Association | volume=54 | issue=1 | pages=31(12) | issn=0004-9670 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The database is still an essential element of the Australian national library networks, and the largest database in Australia of its kind &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nla.gov.au/librariesaustralia/about/anbd/ Australian National Bibliographic Database&lt;/ref&gt;

==National standards==
Training for the network,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Australian Bibliographic Network | author2=Gerrie, Brenda | author3=National Library of Australia | title=Australian Bibliographic Network : a review of training | publication-date=1984 | publisher=National Library of Australia | isbn=978-0-642-99329-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the subject catalogue of the network underwent a range of changes in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Australian Bibliographic Network | author2=Hall, Elaine | author3=National Library of Australia | title=ABN subject cataloguing manual | publication-date=1985 | publisher=National Library of Australia | isbn=978-0-642-99334-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Australian Bibliographic Network | author2=National Library of Australia | title=ABN subject cataloguing manual | publication-date=1989 | publisher=National Library of Australia | edition=2nd | isbn=978-0-642-10476-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ABN Standards Committee met for the first time on 14 May 1981.&lt;ref name=Cathro91/&gt; The issues dealt with in the first four meetings included:
* minimum level of detail in contributed records
* allowable and mandatory changes to bibliographic and authority records
* priorities for authority control
* detailed examination of AACR2 rule interpretations
* standards for geographic names
* extension of [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]] to allow additional 'approved' subject headings
* use of MESH and 'Participant' subject headings
* the subject heading for Australian Aborigines
* policy on duplicate records
* the hierarchy for 'bumping' (record replacement) among different sources
* standards for a 'high level record' that would be immune from bumping
* extension of the Input/Edit system to cater for music, maps and manuscripts &lt;ref name=Cathro91/&gt;

==Publications==
Once established a range of guidelines and publications ensued &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Australian Bibliographic Network | author2=ABN Office | title=ABN news | publication-date=1981 | publisher=ABN Office, National Library of Australia | issn=0726-0644 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Australian Bibliographic Network | title=ABN general news circular | publication-date=1983 | publisher=National Library of Australia | issn=0726-0679 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Australian Bibliographic Network | title=ABN technical bulletin | publication-date=1979 | publisher=ABN Office, National Library of Australia | issn=0726-0660 }} – this particular publication preceded implementation, and continues to date...&lt;/ref&gt;

==Successor==
From 1981 to 1999 this service was  called the Australian Bibliographic Network (ABN) and from 1999 to 2005 the name changed to Kinetica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boston|first1=Tony|last2=Wilson|first2=Fran|title=Libraries Australia and PictureAustralia: Innovation in access at the National Library of Australia|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/openpublish/index.php/nlasp/article/viewFile/1101/1365|publisher=National LIbrary of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elements of the network still exist, but the main public access is by the [[Trove]] website.

'''Carmo Planetarium''' ({{lang-pt|Planetário do Carmo}}) is a [[planetarium]] in [[Parque do Carmo]], eastern [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name="Zeiss" /&gt; It is part of the [[Open University of the Environment and Culture of Peace]] (UMAPAZ), and opened on 30 November 2005.&lt;ref name="prefeitura" /&gt; It is one of three planetaria in São Paulo, the others being [[Professor Aristóteles Orsini Planetarium]]&lt;ref name="Globo_24Jan16" /&gt; and the Johannes Kepler Planetarium at [[Sabina Escola Parque do Conhecimento]].

==Description==
[[File:Planetário do Carmo (386051573).jpg|thumb|right|A view of the planetarium]]
The {{convert|1750|sqm|sqft}} building has a projection dome that is {{convert|10|m|ft}} high and {{convert|20|m|ft}} diameter, with 230 reclining seats, and projection by a [[Carl Zeiss AG]] Universarium VIII, which uses 9,000 optical fibres and 109 lenses to portray the night sky.&lt;ref name="prefeitura" /&gt; There is also a 70-seat classroom, reading space, and a lobby with exhibitions. Two telescopes are located on a terrace behind the planetarium.&lt;ref name="prefeitura" /&gt; The planetarium building cost [[Brazilian real|R$]]11 million to construct, and the projector cost R$5 million to purchase.&lt;ref name="globo_6Jan17" /&gt;

The planetarium is located at 137 John Speers Street. Several bus routes pass near to the planetarium.&lt;ref name="prefeitura" /&gt; It hosts pre-booked school visits on weekdays, and is open to the public on weekends and some weekdays during school holidays.&lt;ref name="prefeitura" /&gt;

==Closures==
The planetarium closed in 2007&lt;ref name="Globo_24Jan16" /&gt; due to structural problems&lt;ref name="folha_22Jan16" /&gt; arising from [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]],&lt;ref name="Gobo_9May16" /&gt; and [[fungi]] was discovered on the lens of the projector in 2010.&lt;ref name="globo_6Jan17" /&gt; The observation area reopened in 2012, before closing again in January 2013 due to a water leak.&lt;ref name="estadao_8May16" /&gt; The planetarium reopened on 8 May 2016,&lt;ref name="carta" /&gt; after repairs costing R$1.2 million.&lt;ref name="Gobo_9May16" /&gt; It reopened with revised management, and a branch of the astrophysics school (which is primarily located at the other planetarium in São Paulo).&lt;ref name="folha_22Jan16" /&gt;

'''Chris Gainor''' is a [[historian]] of [[History of technology|technology]] specializing in [[space exploration]] and [[aeronautics]].  He has written five books on the history of space exploration and on the [[Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow]], a jet interceptor aircraft canceled by the Canadian government in 1959.

Gainor is currently writing a history of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] as part of a contract with the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prlog.org/12423338-nasa-awards-hubble-history-contract.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timescolonist.com/life/islander/nasa-asks-sidney-author-to-write-the-hubble-telescope-story-1.1827793&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Gainor became President of the [[Royal Astronomical Society of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rasc.ca/board-directors&lt;/ref&gt; He is also editor of [[Quest: The History of Spaceflight]] Quarterly,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spacehistory101.com/category_s/1819.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and is a fellow of the [[British Interplanetary Society]].

Gainor holds a Ph.D. in the history of technology from the [[University of Alberta]], and has worked as a history instructor in the [[University of Victoria]]'s history department and as an Assistant Professor for the [[Royal Military College of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;http://chrisgainor.ca&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in his career, Gainor worked as a reporter for the [[Vancouver Sun]], where he won a National Newspaper Award &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nna-ccj.ca/wordpress_dev/wordpress/?page_id=64&amp;lang=en#4&lt;/ref&gt; for a series on Canadian cancer activist [[Terry Fox]]. He also has worked and written for several other publications, and worked for governmental and non-governmental organizations.

His first book, ''Arrows to the Moon,'' tells the story of the 32 British and Canadian aerospace engineers who went to work for the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] in 1959 after losing their jobs when the Canadian government cancelled the [[Avro Arrow]]. Many of these engineers went on to hold top positions in NASA, including [[Jim Chamberlin]], [[John Hodge (engineer)|John Hodge]], [[Owen Maynard]], and [[Tecwyn Roberts]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apogeespacebooks.com/Books/Arrows.html&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the history of the [[Avro Arrow]] with his book ''Who Killed the Avro Arrow?''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lonepinepublishing.com/cat/9781894864688&lt;/ref&gt;

Gainor's more recent academic work has concentrated on the history of missile and space programs in the first years after World War II, including his book ''To A Distant Day: The Rocket Pioneers''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/product/To-a-Distant-Day,673379.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Bomb and America's Missile Age,'' which discusses how the [[U.S. Air Force]] decided to build its first [[intercontinental ballistic missile]], the [[Atlas missile]].&lt;ref&gt;https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/content/bomb-and-americas-missile-age&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written about the history of the Canadian space program, including his book ''Canada in Space.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lonepinepublishing.com/cat/1-894864-59-X&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''citation index''' is a kind of [[bibliographic index]], an index of [[citation]]s between publications, allowing the user to easily establish which later documents cite which earlier documents. A form of citation index is first found in 12th-century Hebrew religious literature. Legal citation indexes are found in the 18th century and were made popular by [[citator]]s such as [[Shepard's Citations]] (1873). In 1960, [[Eugene Garfield]]'s [[Institute for Scientific Information]] (ISI) introduced the first citation index for papers published in [[academic journal]]s, first the ''[[Science Citation Index]]'' (SCI), and later the ''[[Social Sciences Citation Index]]'' (SSCI) and the ''[[Arts and Humanities Citation Index]]'' (AHCI). The first automated citation indexing was done by [[CiteSeer]] in 1997. Other sources for such data include [[Google Scholar]] and Elsevier's [[Scopus]].

==History==
The earliest known citation index is an index of biblical citations in [[rabbinic literature]], the ''Mafteah ha-Derashot'', attributed to [[Maimonides]] and probably dating to the 12th century. It is organized alphabetically by biblical phrase. Later biblical citation indexes are in the order of the canonical text. These citation indices were used both for general and for legal study. The Talmudic citation index ''En Mishpat'' (1714) even included a symbol to indicate whether a Talmudic decision had been overridden, just as in the 19th-century ''Shepard's Citations''.&lt;ref&gt;Bella Hass Weinberg, "The Earliest Hebrew Citation Indexes" in Trudi Bellardo Hahn, Michael Keeble Buckland, eds., ''Historical Studies in Information Science'', 1998, p. 51''ff''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bella Hass Weinberg, "Predecessors of Scientific Indexing Structures in the Domain of Religion" in W. Boyden Rayward, Mary Ellen Bowden, ''The History and Heritage of Scientific and Technological Information Systems'', Proceedings of the 2002 Conference, 2004, p. 126''ff''&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike modern scholarly citation indexes, only references to one work, the Bible, were indexed.

In English legal literature, volumes of judicial reports included lists of cases cited in that volume starting with ''Raymond's Reports'' (1743) and followed by ''Douglas's Reports'' (1783). Simon Greenleaf (1821) published an alphabetical list of cases with notes on later decisions affecting the precedential authority of the original decision.&lt;ref name='shapiro'/&gt;

The first true citation index dates to the 1860 publication of Labatt's ''Table of Cases...California...'', followed in 1872 by Wait's ''Table of Cases...New York...''. But the most important and best-known citation index came with the 1873 publication of [[Shepard's Citations]].&lt;ref name='shapiro'&gt;Fred R. Shapiro, "Origins of Bibliometrics, Citation Indexing, and Citation Analysis: The Neglected Legal Literature" ''Journal of the American Society of Information Science'' '''43''':5:337-339 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major citation indexing services==
{{main article|Indexing and abstracting service}}
{{main cat|Citation indices}}
General-purpose, subscription-based academic citation indexes include:
*[[Web of Science]] by [[Clarivate Analytics]] (previously the Intellectual Property and Science business of [[Thomson Reuters]])
*[[Scopus]] by [[Elsevier]], available online only, which similarly combines subject searching with citation browsing and tracking in the sciences and [[social sciences]].
Each of these offer an index of citations between publications and a mechanism to establish which documents cite which other documents. They are not open-access and differ widely in cost: Web of Science and Scopus are available by subscription (generally to libraries).

In addition, [[CiteSeer]] and [[Google Scholar]] are freely available online. 

Several open-access, subject-specific citation indexing services also exist, such as:
*[[INSPIRE-HEP]] which covers high energy physics,   
*[[PubMed]], which covers life sciences and biomedical topics, and 
*[[Astrophysics Data System]] which covers astronomy and physics.

'''Comboni College for Science and Technology (CCST)''', originally Comboni College for Computer Science, is a private college in Khartoum, [[Sudan]] established since 2001.

==Founding==
Comboni College Khartoum was founded in 1930 by the Italian [[Saint Daniele Comboni|Verona Fathers]]. The boys school had an international intake, but was primarily for Sudanese children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comboni College Khartoum 1955|url=http://www-3.unipv.it/webarchaf/Comboniani/college/rules/comboni_college_khartoum_1955.htm|work=L'Archivio Fotografico dei Missionari Comboniani|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The followers of Comboni founded a Religious Institute made up of Priests and consecrated Brothers who arrived in Sudan to continue Comboni´s work whom education became their main commitment in the country. In 1929 they founded a school called Comboni College Khartoum (CCK). 
In 1999, some parents of the primary section of Comboni College Khartoum asked the Comboni Priests and Brothers to develop a post-secondary section. That initiative then gave place in 2001 to Comboni College of Science and Technology (CCST) as a separate institution from the Primary and the Secondary sections of Comboni College Khartoum.

{{Update|date=July 2013}}
'''Education in Colombia''' includes [[nursery school]], [[elementary school]], [[high school]], technical instruction and [[List of universities in Colombia|university]] education.

== Nursery school in Colombia ==
{{main|Nursery school in Colombia}}
Most of the children over one year old are provided with daycare and nursery school in "Hogares Comunitarios" (community homes) sponsored by the National Institute for Family Welfare (ICBF acronym in Spanish), where mothers from the community take care of their own children, as well as the children from the immediate neighborhood.  When children of Colombia learn how to read and write, they are usually transferred to the elementary school.  There are also a large number of private [[kindergarten]] facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icbf.gov.co Instituto''' Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elementary school ==
{{main|Elementary school in Colombia}}
Elementary school comprises 5 years of formal education. Children usually enroll into grade 1, at age five.  The net primary enrollment (percentage of relevant age-group) attending elementary school (primaria) in 2001 totaled 89.5 percent. In some rural areas, teachers are poorly qualified and drop rates are high. In urban areas, on the other hand, teachers are generally well prepared and knowledgeable of their profession. {{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Colombia developed the method of teaching known as [[Escuela Nueva]] or “New School.” The method transforms the conventional learning paradigm where the teacher is the only one talking and conveying information in a classroom. The idea is that students are placed in the center of the learning process in rural communities. Decades after the model was first developed in 1975, Escuela Nueva has received support — including financial — from the Colombian government, Unesco, and The World Bank, and was implemented into a national educational policy in Colombia in the late 1980s. By 1988, Unesco declared that Colombia was the only country in Latin America and the Caribbean where rural schools outperformed urban schools because of the Escuela Nueva method. Between 2007 and 2009, the program taught 700,000 children in Colombia, and the model is now implemented in 20,000 schools across the country. Escuela Nueva has now expanded internationally to 17 countries, including Brazil, the Philippines and India, benefiting more than five million children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/world/americas/children-thrive-in-rural-colombias-flexible-schools.html|title= Children Thrive in Rural Colombia's Flexible Schools |publisher= nytimes.com|accessdate= 10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secondary school ==
{{see also|List of schools in Colombia}}
Secondary and fourth education is divided in basic secondary (grades 6 to 9) and mid secondary (grades 10 and 11). The mid-secondary education (usually beginning at the age of 15 or 16) offers many different "tracks", which all lead to their own "Bachiller" after a curriculum of two years. Out of the usual academic curriculum (Bachillerato Académico), the students can follow one of the following technical tracks(Bachillerato en Tecnología o Aplicado): Industrial track (Bachillerato Industrial), Commercial track (Bachillerato Comercial), Pedagogical Track (Bachillerato Pedagógico), Agricultural Track (Bachillerato Agropecuario), social promotion track (Bachillerato de Promoción Social).&lt;ref name="UNEVOC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/worldtvetdatabase1.php?ct=COL | title=Vocational Education in Colombia | date=2013-07-05 | accessdate=12 May 2014 | author=UNESCO-UNEVOC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Bachiller" is required to continue into academic or professional higher Education. Nonetheless, technical and professional institutions of higher Education can also welcome students with a "qualification in Arts and business". This qualification is granted by the SENA after a two years curriculum.&lt;ref name="UNEVOC"/&gt;

== University education ==
{{see also|List of universities in Colombia}}
{{See also|Academic ranks in Colombia}}
[[Image:Plaza Che, Bogotá.jpg|thumb|right|'''[[Che Guevara|Che]] Square''' or '''Santander Square''', [[Universidad Nacional de Colombia]], [[Bogotá]]]]
University education is divided into under-graduate degrees and post-graduate degrees and is regulated by the 30th law of 1992.  Most of the university degrees are 5 years long.  Technical formation usually lasts 3 years. Post-graduate education includes specializations, masters and PhD programs.

== Education for Employment and Human Development ==
Education for Employment and Human Development is regulated by law 1064 of 2006 and the 2888 decree of 2007. It provides a degree of technical education: skills and talents to improve the level of subsistence. Education for employment involves technical skills for work through the formation of "labor competences", which is a Colombian strategy to standardize and certify human resource, expanding and diversify the formation and training of human resources. It includes the education provided by the enterprises to their employees. The Colombian government promotes this kind of education as an alternative to university education, which is not accessible for the majority. Some institutions that provide this services are SENA (national service of learning), CESDE, ANDAP, and INCAP among others.

== Challenges ==
Two issues are identified among the main challenges of the public education in the country. On the one hand, 55% of children attending rural schools drop out before concluding their studies. Rural education represents 80% of the educational offer, with many isolated schools and some of them lacking electric energy. A high rate of rural illiteracy is observed (average urban rate was 5,4% and rural 18,6%). On the other hand, the quality of education is a great concern. According to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], the result from the PISA’s test for Colombia in 2006 in Mathematics is below the ones obtained by 61 countries and similar to the countries that obtained the three lowest results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002440/244084e.pdf|title=Comparative review of National Mobile Learning Initiatives in Latin America: The cases of Costa Rica, Colombia, Peru and Uruguay.

The '''Faculty of Political Sciences at Sakarya University''' ({{lang-tr|Siyasal Bilgiler Fakültesi}}, also known as '''SAU SBF''') is one of the sixteen faculties that comprise [[Sakarya University]]. Originally established as Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences in 1992, it was named as the '''Faculty of Political Sciences''' by decree no. 28988 on 2 May 2014.
The faculty spans a range of "discipline areas" and includes Political Science and Public Administration, International Relations, Economics, Labor Economics and Industrial Relations, Public Finance, and Financial Econometrics. The SAU SBF has more than 80 full-time faculty and more than 40 research assistants.&lt;ref&gt;http://sbf.sakarya.edu.tr/en/3107/akademik_kadro&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
The '''Faculty of Political Sciences''' at Sakarya University was originally established as Faculty of Economic and Administrative Sciences by decree no. 3837 on 11 July 1992.

During 1993-1996, [[Sabahattin Zaim]] (1926-2007) served as the first and founding dean of the faculty. As an active member of religious-conservative Society to Disseminate Science (Ilim Yayma Cemiyeti), Zaim put his stamp on the faculty. Some academics served in the faculty during Zaim's period would become the leading figures of conservative/Islamic parties in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;See, Doğan Gürpınar, Türkiye'de Aydının Kısa Tarihi, Istanbul: Etkilesim, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is believed that Zaim invited [[Abdullah Gül]], the 11th President of Turkey, to the faculty,&lt;ref&gt;http://sbf.sakarya.edu.tr/tr/icerik/8809/6905/gecmisteki-degerli-hocalarimiz&lt;/ref&gt; official documents of Sakarya University proves it wrong. Gül actually served in Sakarya University between 1977 and 1983, long before the establishment of the faculty.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sakaryayenihaber.com/10503-gul-un-adapazari-gunleri-haberi.html&lt;/ref&gt; Although Gül was assistant of Sabahattin Zaim, it seems that he has never been in the Faculty of Economic and Administrative Sciences. On the other hand, Zaim's another assistant [[Sami Güçlü]] took an active role in the development of the faculty. Güçlü would be the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in religious-conservative Justice and Development Party government. However, Zaim's influence on the faculty ended after [[1997 Turkish military memorandum]] in Turkey and many professors, who were close to Zaim, left from the faculty.&lt;ref&gt;Necati Mert, Memleket Kitabevi, Istanbul: Iletisim, 2003, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Siyasalfakultesi.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Building of Faculty of Political Sciences]]
The current building of the faculty was constructed in 1998&lt;ref&gt;"Sakarya, Para Arıyor", Milliyet, 14 July 1998, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; but it was devastatingly affected by the [[1999 İzmit earthquake]]. One of its staff, Seydi Önder, lost his life during earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/yokten-5-trilyon-39099047&lt;/ref&gt; Although the faculty moved to prefabs for a while, consecutive earthquakes interrupted education. During the winter semester of 1999-2000 academic year, the faculty suspended its education.&lt;ref&gt;"Sakarya'da Yaz Mesaisi", Milliyet, 22 November 1999, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The faculty restarted its regular education on 28 February 2000.

== Departments ==
When Faculty of Economic and Administrative Sciences inaugurated its education in 1992, it was hosting two departments, Economics, and Management. The department of Labor Economics and Industrial Relations, the department of Public Administration (later Political Science and Public Administration), and the department of International Relations were established between 1994 and 1996. While the department of Public Finance was established in 2002, the department of Financial Econometrics inaugurated its education in 2008. In November 2010, three departments, Management, Tourism Management, and Human Resources Management left from the faculty and they were transferred to the newly established Faculty of Management.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.finansal.sakarya.edu.tr/tr/icerik/6023/8076/tarihce&lt;/ref&gt; Under the SAU SBF, the existing departments are as the followings:

* Political Science and Public Administration
* [[Department of International Relations, Sakarya University|International Relations]]
* Economics
* Labor Economics and Industrial Relations
* Public Finance
* Financial Econometrics

==Research Centers==
The SAU SBF hosted a variety of research centers but some of them were either closed or restructured as institutes. For example, the Center for Middle Eastern Studies was established by the faculty's professors but later it was restructured as an institute under the name [[Sakarya University Middle East Institute]]. The SAU SBF currently hosts three research centers.

* Center for European Union Research and Documentation, ({{lang-tr|Avrupa Birliği Araştırma Dokümantasyon Birimi}}), provides independent, and balanced analysis to help policymakers and researchers navigate the complex politics and economy of the European Union.
* Sakarya Economic and Social Research Center, ({{lang-tr|Sakarya Ekonomik ve Sosyal Araştırmalar Merkezi}})
* Research and Practice Center for Diaspora Studies, ({{lang-tr|Diaspora Çalışmaları Uygulama ve Araştırma Merkezi}})&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haber7.com/sakarya/1737445-sauden-almanya-hak-ve-ozgurlukler-raporu-2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Global Development And Environment Institute''' ('''GDAE''', pronounced “gee-day”) is a research center at [[Tufts University]] founded in 1993. GDAE works to promote a better understanding of how societies can pursue their economic and community goals in an environmentally and socially [[sustainable]] manner. GDAE pursues its mission through original research, policy work, publication projects, curriculum development, conferences and other activities
{{toc right|width=19em}}

==Personnel and programs==
[[Neva Goodwin]]&lt;ref name=rock /&gt; and [[William Moomaw]] are co-directors of GDAE.  The ''Theory and Education'' program, headed by [[Jonathan Harris (economist)|Jonathan Harris]] is developing an economic theory that aims to better serve human needs and address ecological issues. The program explores alternatives to the standard economic paradigm, using new theories and producing educational material.  The ''Research and Policy'' program, led by [[Timothy Wise]], carries out applied research on the effects of economic policies using an analytical framework that assesses the limitations of market-mechanisms for addressing social and environmental issues. Research priorities include [[globalization]], [[food policy]], [[Foreign Direct Investment]], energy and [[climate change]], [[recycling]] and materials use, and sustainable economic integration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Research==
GDAE researchers emphasize ecological health and the correlation between social and economic well-being. They view [[economic system]]s in physical contexts of technology and the natural world, as well as in the social/psychological contexts of history, politics, ethics, culture, institutions, and human motivations.

==Publications==
Between 1995 and 2001 GDAE produced the six-volume series, ''Frontier Issues in Economic Thought'', which was published by [[Island Press]]. The articles that GDAE researchers selected and summarized for this project focus on the limitations of the mainstream economic paradigm and a wide range of creative efforts that have been and are being made to extend economic understanding.&lt;ref name=island /&gt;

===Social Science Library: Frontier Thinking in Sustainable Development and Human Well-being===
GDAE is in the process of distributing an electronic collection of publications for free to universities in 138 nations,&lt;ref name=ssl1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strupp|first1=Julie|title=Africa: American University Distributes Free Social Sciences Library Across Africa|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201309051484.html?aa_source=sptlgt-grid|accessdate=13 January 2016|work=All Africa|date=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with special attention to those institutions that are most in need of library resources. The collection, or the Social Science Library (SSL), contains over 3,400 full-text journal articles, book chapters, reports, and working papers in anthropology, economics, history, philosophy, social psychology, sociology and political science.&lt;ref name=ssl2 /&gt; It also includes full bibliographic references (including abstracts) to more than 6,000 additional articles. The SSL is being distributed to these countries with the assistance of various partner organizations.&lt;ref name=ssl3 /&gt; For people who are not in the recipient countries, a web-based version, with the 10,000+ bibliographic entries, but without the full text PDFs, can be accessed.&lt;ref name=ssl4 /&gt;

==Leontief Prize==
In 2000, GDAE established the Leontief Prize.  Named in honor [[Wassily Leontief]], Nobel laureate and member of the GDAE advisory board, the annual award recognizes outstanding contributions to economic theory that address contemporary realities and support just and sustainable societies.&lt;ref name="Tufts Now"&gt;{{cite news|title=Macroeconomics in the Age of Climate Change|url=http://now.tufts.edu/articles/macroeconomics-age-climate-change|accessdate=13 January 2016|publisher=Tufts Now|date=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Goddard College Campus 2012.jpg|thumbnail|right|Goddard College's Historic Greatwood Campus in [[Plainfield, Vermont]]]]
'''Goddard College''' is a [[Low-residency program|low-residency]] college with three locations in the United States: [[Plainfield, Vermont|Plainfield]], [[Vermont]]; [[Port Townsend, Washington]]; and [[Seattle, Washington]]. The college offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs. With predecessor institutions dating to 1863, Goddard College was founded in 1938 as an experimental and non-traditional educational institution based on the ideas of [[John Dewey]]: that experience and education are intricately linked.&lt;ref name=Carlson-Chronicle-A6&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carlson|first=Scott|title=Goddard College Takes a Highly Unconventional Path to Survival|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=Sep 9, 2011|volume=LVIII|issue=3|page=A6|url=http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/128876/|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goddard College operates on an intensive low-residency model. Each student designs his or her own curriculum and the college uses a student self-directed, mentored system in which faculty issue narrative evaluations of student's progress instead of grades. The intensive low-residency model requires students to come to campus every six months for approximately eight days when students engage in a variety of activities and lectures from early morning until late in the evening and create detailed study plans. During the semester, students study independently, sending in "packets" to their faculty mentors every few weeks. When low-residency education began at Goddard, packets were actual packets of paper sent via the mail, but with the advancement of the internet, most packets are sent electronically and may contain artwork, audio files, photography, video and web pages in addition to writing. The schedule and format of these packets differ from program to program, and content varies with each student-faculty correspondence, but almost always focuses on research, writing, and reflection related to each student's individualized study plan.

Goddard offers a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA), [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] (BFA), [[Master of Arts]] (MA), [[Master of Fine Arts]] (MFA), along with several concentrations and Licensures. It enrolls approximately 700 students, 30% of whom are undergraduates. It employs 110 faculty and 90 staff.

==History==
Goddard College began in 1863 in [[Barre (city), Vermont|Barre, Vermont]], as the '''Green Mountain Central Institute'''.  In 1870, it was renamed as '''Goddard Seminary''' in honor of Thomas A. Goddard (1811-1868) and his wife Mary (1816-1889).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Huff |first=Mel |date=November 2, 2007 |title=Goddard Goes Global |url=https://www.timesargus.com/articles/goddard-goes-global/ |work=Barre Montpelier Times Argus |location=Barre, VT |ref={{sfnRef|"Goddard Goes Global"}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Goddard was a prominent merchant in [[Boston]], and was one of the school's earliest and most generous benefactors.{{sfn|"Goddard Goes Global"}} Founded by [[Christian Universalism|Universalists]], Goddard Seminary was a four-year preparatory [[high school]], primarily for [[Tufts College]]. For many years the Seminary prospered. But the opening of many good public high schools in the 20th century made many of the [[New England]] academies obsolete. To attempt a rescue, the trustees added a [[Junior college|Junior College]] to the Seminary in 1935, with a Seminary graduate, [[Royce S. "Tim" Pitkin]], as President.&lt;ref name=TKFR&gt;{{cite book|last=Benson, Ann Giles &amp;|first=Frank Adams|title=To Know For Real: Royce S. Pitkin and Goddard College|year=1999|publisher=Adamant Press|location=Adamant, Vt|isbn=0912362200|pages=5–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Royce S. "Tim" Pitkin.jpg|thumb|Royce S. "Tim" Pitkin, President of Goddard College for 31 years.]]
Royce S. "Tim" Pitkin was a [[Progressive education|progressive educator]] and follower of [[John Dewey]], [[William Heard Kilpatrick]] and other, similar proponents of educational democracy. In 1936, under his leadership, the Seminary concluded that in order for Goddard to survive, an entirely new institution would need to be created. A number of prominent educators and laymen agreed with him. Pitkin was supported by [[Stanley C. Wilson]], ex-[[List of Governors of Vermont|governor of Vermont]] and chairman of the Goddard Seminary Board of Trustees; [[United States Senate|Senators]] [[George Aiken]] and [[Ralph Flanders]] and [[Dorothy Canfield Fisher]].&lt;ref name="Archer-Town Meeting"&gt;{{cite news|last=Archer|first=Leonard B|title=College Governed Town Meeting Style, Its Buildings a Vermont Farm|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=Jan 13, 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitkin was able to persuade the Board of Trustees to embrace a new style of education, one that substituted individual attention, democracy, and informality for the traditionally austere and autocratic educational model. On March 13, 1938, Goddard College was chartered. In July 1938 the newly formed Goddard College moved to Greatwood Farm in Plainfield, Vermont.

The new Goddard was an experimental and progressive college. For its first 21 years of operation, Goddard was unaccredited and small, but built a reputation as one of the most innovative colleges in the country.&lt;ref name=Carlson-Chronicle-A1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carlson|first=Scott|title=Goddard College Takes a Highly Unconventional Path to Survival|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=Sep 9, 2011|volume=LVIII|issue=3|page=A1|url=http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/128876/|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially noted were Goddard's use of discussion as the basic method in classroom teaching; its emphasis on the whole lives of students in determining personal curricula; its incorporation of practical work into the life of every student; and its development of the college as a self-governing learning community in which everyone had a voice.&lt;ref name=Kiester-Unusual&gt;{{cite news|last=Kiester|first=Ed|title=The Most Unusual College in the U.S.|newspaper=Parade Magazine|date=Jan 30, 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1959 Goddard College was accredited. As of 2015 it is accredited by the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goddard.edu/policies/accreditation Goddard accreditation statement] Retrieved 15 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the founding principles upon which Goddard was founded was that the College should provide educational opportunities for adults.&lt;ref name="Davis-Royces Day-115"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Forest K.|title=Things Were Different in Royce’s Day: Royce S. Pitkin as Progressive Educator: A Perspective from Goddard College, 1950-1967|year=1996|publisher=Adamant Press|location=Adamant, Vermont|isbn=0912362170|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became clear that there was a great need for a program through which adults who had not completed college could obtain degrees without disrupting their family lives or careers. The Adult Degree Program (ADP), created by [[Evalyn Bates]], was established in 1963. It was the first low-residency adult education program in the country.&lt;ref name=Carlson-Chronicle-A6 /&gt;

Over the years many experimental programs were designed at Goddard. These programs included the Goddard Experimental Program for Further Education, Design Build Program, Goddard Cambridge Program for Social Change, Third World Studies Program, [[Institute for Social Ecology]], Single Parent Program and many others.

Having narrative transcripts instead of traditional letter grades, as well as learner-designed curricula, Goddard was one of the founding members of the [[Union for Experimenting Colleges and Universities]], which also included Franconia, Nasson, Antioch, and others.

In 2002, after 54 years, the college terminated its traditional age residential undergraduate degree program and became an exclusively low-residency college.  Three years later, the college expanded to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and established a residency site in [[Port Townsend, Washington]]. In July 2011 Goddard began to offer their education program (non-licensure only) in [[Seattle, Washington]].

===Main campus, Greatwood: Plainfield, Vermont===
The campus in Plainfield was founded in 1938 on the grounds of a late 19th-century model farm: The Greatwood Farm &amp; Estate consists of shingle style buildings and gardens designed by [[Arthur Shurcliff]]. The Village of Learning, consisting of eleven dormitory buildings, was constructed adjacent to the ensemble of renovated farm buildings in 1963 to accommodate an increasing student population. The Pratt Center &amp; Library, sited to be at the heart of a larger campus, was constructed in 1968. No other significant new construction has been added to the campus since that time. On March 7, 1996 the Greatwood campus was recognized for its historic and architectural significance with its inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref name="nom"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=96000253}}| title = National Register of Historic Places Registration Form:Goddard College Greatwood Campus|author=Hal Hutchinson|accessdate = 2015-07-29|format = PDF|date=May 1995|publisher=[[National Park Service]]}} {{NRHP url|id=95000702|title=12 Photos (1995)|photos=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fort Worden State Park, Port Townsend, Washington campus===
A [[United States Army|US Army]] post from 1902 to 1953,&lt;ref&gt;[[Fort Worden]]&lt;/ref&gt; much of the fort has been renovated and turned into a year-round, multi-use facility dedicated to lifelong learning which houses several organizations that comprise  [[Fort Worden State Park]]. The fort sits on a bluff overlooking the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Admiralty Inlet near [[Port Townsend, Washington]].

===Columbia City, Seattle campus===
The MA in Education program, originally held in the Plainfield-based low-residency program, expanded into [[Columbia City, Seattle|Columbia City]], one of Seattle's most ethnically and racially diverse neighborhoods, in 2011.

The program is unique in that it trains students in bilingual preschool education. Students can focus on such areas as intercultural studies, dual language, early childhood, cultural arts, and community education, and then create their plan of studies for each semester. The program is also different in that it is designed to serve students who cannot leave their families and communities for the residency. The “community campus” is housed in different buildings in the area.

==The Eliot D. Pratt Center and Library==
The Eliot D. Pratt Center and Library, located in Plainfield, Vermont serves the entire Goddard College community, and is open to the public. Its holdings contain over 70,000 physical items and access to over 20 electronic databases. The building also houses several administrative offices, an Archives room with artifacts from the 1800s to present, an Art Gallery, and WGDR (91.1 FM), a college/community radio station serving Central Vermont since 1973.

==Goddard College Community Radio (WGDR and WGDH)==
Goddard is home to Goddard College Community Radio, a community-based, non-commercial, listener-supported educational radio station with nearly 70 volunteer programmers who live and work in central and northern Vermont and who range in age from 12 to 78 years. [[WGDR]], 91.1 FM, is licensed to Plainfield, Vermont. Its sister station, [[WGDH]], 91.7 FM, is licensed to Hardwick, Vermont. Goddard College Community Radio is the largest non-commercial community radio station in Vermont and is the only non-commercial station in the state other than the statewide Vermont Public Radio network that receives funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

==Haybarn Theatre==
The Haybarn Theatre was built in 1868 by the Martin Family and was one of the largest barns in Central Vermont. The Haybarn was originally used to store hay, grain and livestock. In 1938 when Goddard College purchased Greatwood Farm they began the process of turning the farm buildings into academic and student spaces. The Haybarn was renovated in order to provide a space for the performing arts.

For almost 75 years the Haybarn Theatre has been a place where the local community and the College come together to enjoy and appreciate the arts. This long tradition continues to this day as the Haybarn hosts educational conferences, student and community performances and the ongoing Goddard College Concert Series.

The '''Goulstonian Lectures''' are an annual lecture series given on behalf of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] in London. They began in 1639. The lectures are named for [[Theodore Goulston]] (or Gulston, died 1632), who founded them with a bequest. By his will, dated 26 April 1632, he left £200 to the College of Physicians of London to found a lectureship, to be held in each year by one of the four youngest doctors of the college. These lectures were annually delivered from 1639, and have continued for more than three centuries.&lt;ref name = DNB&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Goulston, Theodore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to the end of the 19th century, the spelling ''Gulstonian'' was often used. In many cases the lectures have been published.

Gulston's widow bequeathed{{clarify|date=July 2014}} the annual donation to the College of Physicians for them to arrange for one of the four youngest doctors to "read the lecture on some dead body (if it could be procured), to be dissected as the President and Elects should think necessary for the diseases to be treated of ; the lecture to be read yearly, between Christmas and Easter, on three days together ; and the reader to treat of three or more diseases, as the seniors of the College should direct ; ten pounds to be paid to the doctor who should read, and two pounds to the dissector and for burying the body".

'''Jeanne Clemson''' (1922 – September 12, 2009) was an [[Americans|American]] [[artistic director]], [[theater director]], [[actress]], [[educator]] and [[Historic preservation|preservationist]]. Clemson was considered  instrumental in the efforts to save the [[Fulton Opera House]], located in [[downtown]] [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], from demolition during the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name=ij&gt;{{cite news|first=Jane|last=Holahan|title=Jeanne Clemson dies at 87|url=http://articles.lancasteronline.com/local/4/242238|work=[[Intelligencer Journal]]|publisher=|date=2009-09-15|accessdate=2009-10-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924030130/http://articles.lancasteronline.com/local/4/242238|archivedate=2009-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also credited with restoring live theater productions to the Fulton.&lt;ref name=ij3/&gt;

The Fulton Opera House is now a [[National Historic Landmark]], designated in 1964.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Clemson was born '''Jeanne Hershberger''' in 1922 in [[Bedford County, Pennsylvania]]&lt;ref name=ij/&gt; to parents, Fred L. and Olive Bussard Hershberger.&lt;ref name=ij2&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |title=Obituary of Jeanne Clemson |url=http://obits.lancasteronline.com/index.php?p=2389894 |work=[[Intelligencer Journal]] |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2009-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713183332/http://obits.lancasteronline.com/index.php?p=2389894 |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was raised in [[Everett, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=ij2/&gt;

She received her [[bachelor's degree]] in [[drama]], with a minor in applied music, from [[Penn State University]].&lt;ref name=ij2/&gt; She also obtained her [[teaching certification]] from Penn State.&lt;ref name=ij2/&gt; Clemson further earned her [[master's degree]] from the School of Speech at [[Northwestern University]] on a [[scholarship]].&lt;ref name=ij2/&gt;

She met her future husband, Charles R. Clemson, during her freshman year at Penn State University.&lt;ref name=ij2/&gt; The couple married in 1945.&lt;ref name=ij2/&gt; They had two children, Cheryl Jeanne and John Alfred.&lt;ref name=ij2/&gt;

===Career===
[[File:Fulton Opera House.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Clemson is credited with saving the [[Fulton Opera House]].]]
Clemson began her career by teaching music at the [[National Cathedral School]] in [[Washington D.C.]]&lt;ref name=ij2/&gt; The family next relocated to [[Western Pennsylvania]]&lt;ref name=ij2/&gt; before permanently moving to [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], during the mid-1950s.&lt;ref name=ij2/&gt;

Clemson, who was a fan of theater, quickly became involved in the local Lancaster theater community and appeared at the Green Room Theatre, which was affiliated with [[Franklin and Marshall College]].&lt;ref name=ij/&gt; Until Clemson joined, the Green Room Theatre had been a male-only theater school.&lt;ref name=ij2/&gt; Local theater companies launched one or two theater productions a year at the time.&lt;ref name=ij/&gt;

In the late 1950s, local [[activists]], including Clemson, began to work for the [[Historic preservation|preservation]] of the Fulton Opera House, a Lancaster Victorian structure constructed in 1870.&lt;ref name=ij/&gt; The Fulton Opera House was in danger of [[demolition]] at the time.&lt;ref name=ij/&gt; Clemson and others advocated not just preserving the Fulton Opera House, but also restoring it into a full-time theater again.&lt;ref name=ij/&gt;

Efforts to save the Fulton Opera House and stage productions began to pay off.  The 1959 production of ''[[Our Town]]'', starring Jeanne Clemson, marked that first time that a live theater production had been staged at the Fulton Opera House in thirty years.&lt;ref name=ij/&gt; In 1964, the Fulton Opera House was added to the list of [[National Historic Landmark]]s and further placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1969.&lt;ref name=ij/&gt; Much of the credit in preserving the opera house went to Clemson. In a 2009 interview with the ''[[Intelligencer Journal]]'', Rob Brock, head of the Lancaster Hole-in-the-Wall Puppet Theatre, noted, "I think there is a very good chance the Fulton would not be here without her involvement."&lt;ref name=ij/&gt;

In 1968, Jeanne Clemson and Emily Pat Hoffman founded the [[Actors Company of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=ij/&gt; The Actors Company grew considerable over the next three decades, further fueling local theater in Lancaster and other parts of [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=ij/&gt; The company expanded the local audience for local theater, as well as the pool of actors and other talent.&lt;ref name=ij/&gt; Clemson, who served as the company's [[artistic director]] until 1996,&lt;ref name=ij2/&gt; carried out many of the tasks needed for the Actors Company's productions, including local [[casting]], [[Theatre director|directing]] and [[costume design]].&lt;ref name=ij/&gt; Clemson's establishment of the Actors Company is also credited with laying the foundation for the establishment of other [[theater companies]] within [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]], including the [[Ephrata Performing Arts Center]], Theater of the Seventh Sister and the Independent Eye.&lt;ref name=ij/&gt;

Clemson negotiated and oversaw the [[merger]] of the Actors Company of Pennsylvania and the Fulton Theatre Company in 1996.&lt;ref name=ij/&gt; Following the merger, she continued to work with the Fulton Academy, which worked to introduce children to theater and [[acting]].&lt;ref name=ij/&gt; She remained on the Fulton Opera House's board of directors until her death in 2009.&lt;ref name=ij3/&gt;

Additionally, Clemson taught and headed the [[drama department]] at [[Lancaster Country Day School]].  She joined the faculty of Lancaster Country Day in 1962,&lt;ref name=ij2/&gt; and remained at the school for 29 years, until her retirement from the school in 1991.&lt;ref name=ij/&gt;

===Death===
Jeanne Clemson died from [[Parkinson's disease]] on September 12, 2009, at the Homestead Village retirement community in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, at the age of 87.&lt;ref name=ij/&gt; Her husband, Charles Clemson, died in 2006 after 61 years of marriage.&lt;ref name=ij2/&gt;

A [[funeral|memorial service]] was held for Clemson on September 27, 2009, at the Unitarian Universalist Church, followed by a reception at the Fulton Opera House, the Lancaster landmark in which she is credited with preserving.&lt;ref name=ij3&gt;{{cite news|first=Ad |last=Crable |title=Obituary Saying goodbye to a pillar of local theater |url=http://articles.lancasteronline.com/local/4/242767#|work=[[Intelligencer Journal]]|publisher=|date=2009-09-28 |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julius Benjamin Richmond''' (September 26, 1916 – July 27, 2008) was an American pediatrician and public health administrator. He was a [[Vice Admiral (United States)|vice admiral]] in the [[United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps]] and served as the [[United States Surgeon General]] and the [[United States Assistant Secretary for Health]] during the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter Administration]], from 1977 to 1981. Richmond is noted for his role in the creation of the [[Head Start (program)|Head Start]] program for disadvantaged children, serving as its first national director.

==Biography==

=== Early years ===
Richmond was born in [[Chicago]] He was educated during the [[Great Depression]], earning his B.S. at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], followed by an M.S. in physiology and his M.D. from the [[University of Illinois College of Medicine]] in 1939. After completing an 18-month rotating internship at [[John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County|Cook County Hospital]] in Chicago, Richmond entered two [[pediatrics]] residencies, the first at Chicago's Municipal Contagious Disease Hospital (1941&amp;ndash;1942) and the second at Cook. The United States’ entry into [[World War II]] interrupted Richmond's postgraduate training, as he volunteered and was inducted into the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] in February 1942. Through 1946 Richmond worked as a flight [[surgery|surgeon]] with the Air Force's Flying Training Command.

===Career===
After demobilization, Richmond completed his residency and began what would be a distinguished [[academic]] career in which public service was an integral part of scholarly [[research]]. He began as a professor in Pediatrics at his alma mater (1946&amp;ndash;53) and a Markle Foundation scholar in medical science (1948&amp;ndash;53), and was active both in nonprofit children's welfare organizations and Chicago's Institute for Psychoanalysis. During 1953 he moved to the State University of New York at Syracuse College of Medicine (now known as the Upstate Medical Center). The Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) inspired Richmond and his colleague, [[Betty Caldwell]], to turn their interdisciplinary research, integrating elements of [[psychiatry]] into [[pediatrics]], toward policy ends as they documented how poverty threatened the psychosocial development of young children. They focused on cognitive abilities developed during a child's first years, where functional deficits linked to [[poverty]], for example, those caused by [[malnutrition]], could make learning more difficult and as a result, put the children of the poor at risk of failing both at school and later on, in attempts to advance economically.

Richmond's work at Syracuse caught the eye of [[Sargent Shriver]], head of the [[Kennedy Foundation]]. After President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] tapped Shriver to head a new independent agency, the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] (OEO) (1964), Shriver convinced Richmond to take a leave of absence and join him. At OEO Richmond would use a demonstration grants mechanism to create two important new public health programs that incorporated OEO's mandate to aid local groups directly, rather than channeling resources through state health departments, the traditional partners of the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]]'s [[United States Public Health Service|Public Health Service]]. During 1965, Richmond implemented Project [[Head Start (program)|Head Start]], an enrichment program for disadvantaged pre-school age children that was greeted eagerly by community groups. Building on health-related proposals submitted in response to Head Start, in 1966 Richmond sponsored a series of Neighborhood Health Centers that united economic development and local oversight of, and participation in, health services delivery.

In 1967, Richmond left OEO to return to Syracuse, to serve as Dean of the medical faculty. During 1971 he moved to [[Harvard Medical School]], where he held professorships in two departments, Child Psychiatry and Human Development (1971&amp;ndash;73) and Preventive &amp; Social Medicine (1971&amp;ndash;79), directed the Judge Baker Guidance Center in Boston (1971&amp;ndash;77), a nonprofit mental health organization that works with Boston's juvenile courts, and also served as Chief of Psychiatry at the [[Children's Hospital Boston]].

===Surgeon General===
Nearly a decade later after Richmond stepped down from OEO, former OEO official [[Joseph Califano]], now President [[Jimmy Carter]]’s Secretary of DHEW, asked him to return to Federal service as Assistant Secretary for Health (July 1977). Richmond accepted, on condition that his position as Assistant Secretary, with its line authority over PHS, be combined with that of Surgeon General, widely recognized as a spokesperson for public health. Califano obliged with a December 1977 inhouse reorganization that boosted and streamlined PHS's management capabilities through its Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH).

Richmond brought a commitment to access and equity that reflected his earlier work implementing President Johnson's [[Great Society]]. In national health affairs, however, the latter half of the 1970s was a period of retrenchment and effort to curb health-related expenditures. Economic downturns challenged the country's willingness to support a continued expansion of health care programs and after 1974, the removal of wage and price controls on health care providers meant dramatic cost increases for the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] programs. Many believed that controls were a necessary prerequisite to any form of [[national health insurance]], and the type of controls became a point of contention, for example, with the Congress opposing the Carter Administration's decision to focus on [[hospital]] expenditures.

Despite the times, Richmond's neighborhood health centers remained, championed by Congress and reinforced by an assortment of PHS programs to improve access to care. Transferred to PHS jurisdiction in the early 1970s, neighborhood health centers were renamed [[Community health centers in the United States|Community Health Centers]], authorized under 1975 legislation, scaled down and revamped to focus on rural (1975) and urban (1977) areas, spread thin to include new constituencies like residents of [[Appalachia]] and [[migrant worker]]s and those served by PHS's National Health Service Corps. During Richmond's tenure, Congress would pass the [[Health Services and Centers Act of 1978]] (PL95-626), which reauthorized a broad array of public health services, community and migrant health centers, grants for primary care projects, and grants-in-aid to support public health programs and authorized $2.9 billion in expenditures. The health of children also remained a top priority. The Communicable Disease Center (CDC) carried out a successful [[immunization]] campaign that focused on [[measles]] and other childhood diseases that disproportionately affected the poor, meeting an initial goal of immunizing at least 90 percent of eligible children by October 1979. In addition, there were efforts to establish a Child Health Assurance Program to improve prevention by broadening eligibility for the existing Medicaid Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment Program.

At PHS Richmond remains best known for his leadership in devising and implementing quantitative goals for public health, first published in 1979 as ''Healthy People: The Surgeon General’s Report on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention''. ''Healthy People'' moved PHS beyond its limited capabilities to lessen disparities in health services provision, to spur change by getting information out to journalists, health departments, and others about gains already made in reduced mortality from noninfectious causes. Richmond and Secretary Califano drew on the precedent of former Surgeon General [[Luther Terry]]'s [[1964 Report on Smoking and Health]] to build professional and public consensus toward making prevention key to PHS's efforts.

A new [[Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion]] (1979) under Assistant Surgeon General [[J. Michael McGinnis|Michael McGinnis]] prepared the formal publication, setting forth ambitious health goals to be achieved by 1990, and the Institute of Medicine drafted an accompanying volume, ''Promoting Health/Preventing Disease: Objectives For The Nation'' (1980), which included a series of specific targets within set categories for each age-group. One of the major goals of this effort was to educate people on how they could take more personal responsibility for their health through wise lifestyle choices. Richmond's Healthy People campaign was a remarkable success, especially in light of the political firestorm in Congress and by the tobacco industry when Secretary Califano became an outspoken critic of [[cigarette]] smoking as a major contributor to preventable disease.

===Later years===
After the [[Reagan Administration]] assumed power in January 1981, Richmond stepped down from his dual post and returned to academe.

At Harvard, Richmond would serve as a Professor of Health Policy (1981&amp;ndash;1988) and as the John D. MacArthur Professor of Management and Director of the [[Division of Health Policy Research and Education]] (1987 onward) and as well chair the steering committee of the [[National Academy of Science]]’s Forum on the Future of Children and Families (NAS). From 1988 he was [[Emeritus]] at [[Harvard Medical School]] in the Department of Social Medicine (DSM), now the [http://GHSM.HMS.Harvard.edu Department of Global Health and Social Medicine], which he had founded under HMS Dean Robert Ebert.

Richmond died of cancer at age 91 at his home in [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts]], near Boston, on July 27, 2008.

A collection of his papers is held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/richmond383|title=Julius B. Richmond Papers 1941-2004; bulk 1968-1997|publisher=National Library of Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kenny Ray Carter''' (born February 13, 1959) is an American business owner, education activist and former high school basketball coach. Carter attended college at [[San Francisco State]], then [[Contra Costa College]], and finally [[George Fox University]], where he played basketball.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page3/story?page=merron/coachcarter ESPN.com: Page 3 – How real is the reel 'Coach Carter?']&lt;/ref&gt; He was portrayed by [[Samuel L. Jackson]] in the 2005 film, ''[[Coach Carter]]''.

==Biography==
Coming from an abusive family, Carter was raised strictly on academics, but found a liking in sports. As a basketball coach, he maintained that his athletes must take their studies seriously, as good academic performance would give them access to college and other opportunities in life.

This belief was put to the test when, as a high school basketball coach at [[Richmond High School (Richmond, California)|Richmond High School]], he locked out his undefeated team for not honoring academic and behavioral contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Richmond Rebound / High school basketball players hit books, coach lifts his lockout |url=https://www.sfgate.com/education/article/Richmond-Rebound-High-school-basketball-players-2952622.php |website=SFGate.com |date=January 12, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the community was outraged at first, public opinion eventually changed, and Carter was praised for his determined emphasis on prioritizing good values for his team. His approach also bore results: every one of his players at Richmond, where he coached from 1997 to 2002, graduated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgefox.edu/journalonline/winter05/lockout.html Coach Ken Carter: From Lockout to Open Doors] George Fox Journal&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the 1999 season is the basis for the [[2005 in film|2005 film]] ''[[Coach Carter]]'', with Carter played by [[Samuel L. Jackson]].

Carter continues to coach sports teams, except basketball. He coached the [[Slamball]] team [[Rumble (slamball team)|Rumble]]. He led Rumble to their first-ever Slamball Cup victory in 2001/2002. Carter has said that the greatest moment in his life was when he carried the [[Olympic Torch]] for the [[2002 Winter Olympics]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Carter has a son named Damien (who played for his father at Richmond, and was portrayed by [[Robert Ri'chard]] in the movie) and currently resides in San Antonio, TX.

In the fall of 2005, Carter proposed opening a boarding school called the Coach Carter Impact Academy in the town of [[Marlin, Texas]].  The school never opened and by 2012, the project had been abandoned.

== Life and work ==
Hein was born in [[Forest Park, Illinois]] to Harry Christian and Clara A. (Klein) Hein. He received his BSc magna cum laude at the [[Loyola University Chicago]] in 1952, and his PhD at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1954 with the thesis entitled "The Impact of the British Companies Acts Upon the Major Areas of the Practice of Accountancy in the British Isles." In 1955 he obtained his [[Certified Public Accountant]] certificate in the state of Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Catt Armstrong (1976). ''Who's who in California,'' p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hein started his academic career as instructor at the [[DePaul University]]. He jointed the Los Angeles State College, now California State University, Los Angeles, in 1956. There he was promoted Assistant Professor of accounting in 1957,&lt;ref&gt;''The American economic review,'' Vol. 47, Nr 1-2 (1957), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Associate Professor of Business Administration in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;''The Accounting review,'' Vol. 34.

The first '''libraries in China''' came into being during the time of the Shang dynasty (the sixteenth to eleventh centuries B.C.) as intellectuals known as the Shi (historians) and Wu (diviners) emerged from manual labor to special occupations for the creation and spread of culture. Among the documents that these occupations managed were "the country's statute books, genealogies of imperial kinsmen, issued notices and orders, and recorded important events and natural phenomena. For future verification and reference, they built storehouses to keep records in different media. To meet the needs of more and more complicated affairs and to ensure easy use, they began to collect and sort out those records according to chronological order and category. Thus, the earliest library in China came into being. The numerous kinds of media loaded with information and knowledge emerged in human society, resulting in the concepts of preservation and collection. Accordingly, the earliest libraries and archives were the result of conscious collection, process, coalition, and utilization."&lt;ref&gt;Hua, Xie Zhuo (1996). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25548455 Libraries and the development of culture in China.] "Libraries &amp; Culture", No. 3/4, pp. 533.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the [[history of China]], scholars had extensive private libraries, and all of the imperial [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasties]] constructed [[library|libraries]] and [[archive]]s to house literary treasures and official records. The first modern libraries, however, did not appear in China until the late nineteenth century; even then, library service grew slowly and sporadically. In 1949 there were only fifty-five public libraries at the county level and above, most concentrated in major coastal commercial centers.

Following the founding of the People's Republic, government and education leaders strove to develop library services and make them available throughout the country. The National Book Coordination Act of 1957 authorized the establishment of two national library centers, one in [[Beijing]] ([[National Library of China]]) and the other in [[Shanghai]] ([[Shanghai Library]]), and nine regional library networks. Even so, libraries still were scarce, and those facilities that were available were cramped and offered only rudimentary services. Seeing the lack of libraries as a major impediment to [[modernization]] efforts, government leaders in the early 1980s took special interest in the development of library services. The special concentration of funds and talent began to produce significant results. More than forty Chinese institutions of [[higher education|higher learning]] also had established [[library science]] or [[information science]] departments. There were more than 2,300 public libraries at the county level and above, containing nearly 256 million volumes, and below the county level some 53,000 cultural centers included a small library or reading room.

At the end of 2004, China had 2,710 public libraries with a collection of over 400 million copies. There were 2,925 [[public libraries]] in China in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/newsandcomingevents/t20120222_402786587.htm |title=Statistical Communiqué on the 2011 National Economic and Social Development |date=22 February 2012 |accessdate=5 September 2012 |work=stats.gov.cn |publisher=[[National Bureau of Statistics of China]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806094456/http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/newsandcomingevents/t20120222_402786587.htm |archivedate=6 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the [[university]] or [[college]] libraries, the collections of [[Peking University]] and [[Zhejiang University]] libraries lead the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.pku.edu.cn/portal/index.jsp PKU Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424034408/http://www.lib.pku.edu.cn/portal/index.jsp |date=24 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uri.edu/artsci/lsc/web/Academics/Courses/travelchina/Zhejiang%20Univ.%20Library.htm ZJU Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913184820/http://www.uri.edu/artsci/lsc/web/Academics/Courses/travelchina/Zhejiang%20Univ.%20Library.htm |date=13 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The national library network also includes scientific research institution libraries, trade union libraries, plus libraries and reading rooms attached to government institutions, army units, primary and secondary schools, townships, enterprises and local communities.

==National Library==

The country's main library, the [[National Library of China]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19981206041110/http://www.nlc.gov.cn/ Official site of the National Library of China.] Users can search database of books, periodicals, and statistical yearbooks.&lt;/ref&gt; housed a rich collection of books, periodicals, newspapers, maps, prints, photographs, manuscripts, microforms, tape recordings, and inscriptions on bronze, stone, bones, and tortoiseshells.

The National Library of China, with a collection of over 26 million volumes, is the largest library in [[Asia]], housing the largest collection of Chinese books in the world. In the library's collection are over 35,000 [[oracle bone]]s and [[turtle shell|tortoise shell]]s carved with [[ancient Chinese characters]], 1.6 million volumes of traditional thread-bound books, over 16,000 volumes of documents from [[Dunhuang Grottoes]], 12 million volumes of [[foreign-language]] books, and dozens of [[electronic database]]s.

The library started to accept the submissions of official national publications in 1916, becoming the main national database; and began to accept submissions of domestic electronic publications in 1987. It is also the country's ISSN ([[International Standard Serial Number]]) Center and Network Information Center. At present, the National Library of China has formed a [[digital library]] alliance with some 90 other libraries around the country, making joint efforts in promoting the development and application of China's digital public information service. The second phase of the National Library – China Digital Library, whose foundation was laid at the end of 2004, is planned to be completed and commissioned in October 2007. The expanded library will be able to meet book storage demand for the next 30 years. The Digital Library will make it the world's biggest [[Chinese literature]] collection center and digital resources base, as well as the most advanced network service base in China.

== Other Libraries ==
The [[Shanghai Municipal Library]], one of the largest public libraries in the country, contained over 7 million volumes, nearly 1 million of which were in foreign languages. The Shanghai Library, well known at home and abroad, is China's largest provincial-level library. Of its collection, the over 1.7 million volumes of ancient documents are the most valuable and representative, including 25,000 titles of rare ancient books in 178,000 volumes, many being the only copies extant in the world. The oldest document dates back nearly 1,500 years.

The [[Peking University]] Library took over the collections of the [[Yanjing University]] Library in 1950 and by the mid-1980s – with more than 3 million volumes, one-fourth of them in [[foreign language]]s – was one of the best university libraries in the country. It is one of the earliest modern new libraries in China. Approved by the State Council as the first batch of national key ancient books protection unit, has developed into a resource rich, modern, comprehensive, open research library.&lt;ref&gt;Lib.pku.edu.cn.

The '''MSC Student Conference on National Affairs (MSC SCONA)''' is an annual conference where military and civilian students across Texas, the United States, and the world to exchange ideas and discuss the role of the United States in the global community.

MSC SCONA was founded in 1955 by John Jenkins '56 and Bud Whitney '56, senior students in the [[Texas A&amp;M University Corps of Cadets]], after they had attended the 6th Student Conference on United States Affairs (SCUSA) at the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point. Jenkins and Whitney sought to bring in students from across the South to a similar conference held at Texas A&amp;M to allow those students to engage in an experience just as valuable as West Point's but closer to home.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Building Leaders, Living Traditions: The Memorial Student Center at Texas A&amp;M|last=Bacon|first=Amy|publisher=TAMU Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-60344-095-0|location=College Station, Texas|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/43468321/|title=The Eagle from Bryan, Texas on November 28, 1962 &amp;middot; Page 10|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2017-05-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/43468192/|title=The Eagle from Bryan, Texas on November 28, 1962 &amp;middot; Page 1|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2017-05-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MSC SCONA 1's keynote speaker was [[United States Army]] Major General [[William J. Donovan]], founder of the WWII-era [[Office of Strategic Services]] that later became the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The highest ranking military officer to speak at an MSC SCONA conference was in 2015 with then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff GEN [[Martin Dempsey]], [[United States Army]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/Former-Joint-Chiefs-chair-No-magic-bullet-7083421.php|title=Former Joint Chiefs chairman: ‘No magic bullet’ in war on ISIS|work=San Antonio Express-News|access-date=2017-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/604134/dempsey-russia-terrorists-cyber-among-top-threats/|title=Dempsey: Russia, Terrorists, Cyber Among Top Threats|work=U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE|access-date=2017-08-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/604128/great-leadership-is-a-constant-dempsey-tells-texas-am-cadets/|title=Great Leadership is a Constant, Dempsey Tells Texas A&amp;M Cadets|work=U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE|access-date=2017-08-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prestigious civilian was then-[[Vice President of the United States]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] of Texas for SCONA 8. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Organization and Partnerships==
===Structure===

Every year, MSC SCONA develops a relevant topic to guide discussions, anchor policy proposals, and provide inspiration for the conference speakers and facilitators. The approximately 150 delegates represent universities across the United States and commonly include all Federal Service Academies, the seven [[United States Senior Military College]]s, and top schools from across the [[Southeastern Conference]], among other prestigious institutions. 

Although MSC SCONA once included delegates from local high schools as well as from as far away as Mexico and Canada, both practices have since been discontinued due to decreases of funding in the 1990s and a focus on a more rigorous standard of discussions. Since at least as far back as the time of SCONA Finance Chairman [[Henry Cisneros]], later the Secretary of [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]], members of the committee have traveled to major cities across Texas to raise private funds from businesses and individuals in order to operate the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11549323|title=Cisneros: Portrait of a New American|last=Kemper|first=Diehl|publisher=Corona Publishing Company|others=|year=1985|isbn=0931722373|location=San Antonio, Texas|pages=|oclc=11549323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference is organized and run by a committee of [[Texas A&amp;M University]] students. These students, many of them from the [[Texas A&amp;M University Corps of Cadets]] and the Texas A&amp;M [[Bush School of Government and Public Service]], serve as delegates, roundtable hosts, and conference staff members as well as the executive leadership. MSC SCONA became racially integrated fully in 1961, several years before the University as a whole, and partially at the behest of a famous speaker, then-[[Vice President of the United States]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1085&amp;context=daily_lobo_1961|title=The New Mexico Lobo|last=Curtis|first=Gerald|date=Dec 15, 1961|work=The New Mexico Lobo|access-date=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategic Partnerships===

MSC SCONA has an enduring partnership with the now 70th Student Conference on U.S. Affairs (SCUSA) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usma.edu/scusa/SitePages/Home.aspx|title=Student Conference on US Affairs - Home|website=www.usma.edu|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point as well as the now 55th [[Naval Academy Foreign Affairs Conference]] at the [[United States Naval Academy]] at Annapolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/43489525/|title=The Eagle from Bryan, Texas on October 29, 1971 &amp;middot; Page 12|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2017-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://docslide.net/documents/msc-extra-spring-2015.html|title=MSC Extra!

Since 2011, MSC SCONA has partnered with the [[United States Army War College]] to hold a pre-conference exercise called the International Strategic Crisis Negotiation Exercise (ISCNE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://csl.armywarcollege.edu/usacsl/publications/IP8_11_ISCNEProgram.pdf|title=ISCNE Program|last=|first=|date=May 2011|website=Center for Strategic Leadership, US Army War College|access-date=5/26/17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://media-newswire.com/release_1143665.html|title=Media-Newswire.com - Press Release Distribution - PR Agency|last=Distribution|first=Media-Newswire.com - Press Release|website=media-newswire.com|access-date=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In previous years, this experience has focused on international conflicts like that of the Nagorno-Karabakh region (2018) and the island of Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a544357.pdf|title=Developing a Diplomatic Corps that is Second-to-None|last=White|first=Samuel|date=05/01/2011|website=Center for Strategic Leadership|publisher=U.S. Army War College|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=9/11/2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theeagle.com/news/a_m/winnefeld-to-speak-at-a-m-conference/article_8d4594e5-532e-545a-8560-214204fcd57b.html|title=Winnefeld to speak at A&amp;M conference|work=The Eagle|access-date=2017-09-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exercise is also held at approximately a dozen graduate schools of government and public service nationwide. MSC SCONA remains the only student-led and organized version of the ISCNE program.  

The Texas A&amp;M [[Bush School of Government and Public Service]] and MSC SCONA have a long standing relationship beyond student leadership to include speakers such as former Dean Amb. [[Ryan Crocker]], speaking at SCONA 56 in 2011 and 61 in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://today.tamu.edu/2016/02/11/national-student-conference-to-focus-on-crucial-problems-facing-u-s/|title=National Student Conference To Focus On Crucial Problems Facing U.

In 2017, [[United States Army]] officers and civilian staff modified the exercise, then renamed as the Domestic Crisis Strategic Response Exercise (DCSRE), in order to better complement SCONA 62's topic of homeland security. Speakers at the latest conference include Commandant of the [[United States Marine Corps]] General [[Robert Neller]], Director of the [[National Security Agency]] Admiral [[Michael S. Rogers]], USN, Director of Los Alamos National Laboratory [[Charles F. McMillan]], and Islamic reformer Dr. [[Tawfik Hamid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theeagle.com/news/local/students-exchange-ideas-at-the-student-conference-on-national-affairs/article_90e5fb8e-c5c4-537d-bf0e-69c68074ff07.html|title=Students Exchange ideas at the Student Conference on National Affairs at Texas A&amp;M|last=Fiedler|first=Rebecca|date=|work=The Eagle|access-date=2017-08-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thebatt.com/life-arts/scona-hosts-delegates-from-universities-in-annual-conference/article_2060ac66-f70f-11e6-95c1-f37200559a3b.html|title=SCONA hosts delegates from 22 universities in annual conference|last=Handel|first=Jonathan|work=The Battalion|access-date=2017-08-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meister Cody''' is an [[Online game|online training game]] with an integrated diagnostic screening test for children with [[dyscalculia]] and math weakness, the [[CODY Assessment]]. It was developed as a part of the CODY Project,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.meistercody.com/en/page/science/ ''CODY Assessment'' Link to scientific based background of the CODY Project. Retrieved 2016-05-09]&lt;/ref&gt; a collaboration with psychologists and neuroscientists at the [[University of Münster]], and technology experts at ''Kaasa health'' (an [[mHealth]] tech company based in [[Düsseldorf]]). The [[educational video game]] is used by parents, teachers and therapists as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool. The scientific research at the [[University of Münster]] drove the development of the computer-based training software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-muenster.de/CODY/training.html ''CODY-Training'' Website of the University of Münster. Retrieved 2016-05-09]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
Before the training begins, children take the [[CODY Assessment]], a voluntary screening test that detects four dyscalculia relevant aspects: core markers (Dot Enumeration (DE), Magnitude Comparison (MCS, MCM)), number processing skills, calculation skills, and working memory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.meistercody.com/en/page/test-and-training/ ''Meister Cody Test'' Link to test and training page. Retrieved 2016-05-09]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, J.-T./ Holling, H.: ''Number sense or working memory? The effect of two computer-based trainings on mathematical skills in elementary school.''  In: Advances in Cognitive Psychology, 2014, vol. 10(2), pp. 59-67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, J.-T.: ''Developmental Dyscalculia. Causes, Characteristics, and Interventions.'' In: Zeitschrift für Psychologie, 2015, vol. 223, pp 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt;
The CODY training targets impaired number skills that could underlie dyscalculia. The focus lies on aspects of number and quantity processing, such as quantity-number-linkage, part-whole relationship, spatial ability, relational number perception, fact retrieval, [[subitizing]], understanding of the positional notation system and [[transcoding]].&lt;ref&gt;Landerl, K./ Kaufmann, L.: ''Dyskalkulie. Modelle, Diagnostik, Intervention'', 2008, pp. 120-122.&lt;/ref&gt; Training includes 19 different tasks. The first version of CODY training, which had four key tasks, was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial, and compared with a computer-based training of inductive reasoning. A meta-analysis by psychologists at the University of Münster about children with mathematical disorders showed: "Computer-based interventions were also effective".&lt;ref&gt;Chodura, S., Kuhn, J.-T., Holling, H.: ''Interventions for Children With Mathematical Difficulties: A Meta-Analysis. Special edited issue on developmental dyscalculia.'' In: Zeitschrift für Psychologie, 2015, vol. 223, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The math training is embedded in an adventure story and incorporates gamification via its reward system. Daily training (3–5 days per week) is recommended for maximum growth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.meistercody.com/en/page/science/ ''CODY Assessment'' Link to scientific based background of the CODY project. Retrieved 2015-08-06]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characters ==
The main character of the educational game is Meister Cody, a traveler, storyteller, scholar and master magician. He receives a call for help through his crystal ball from the Kingdom of Talasia. He asks the game player to assist Princess Namea and Prince Fandales to save Talasia. The epic story has many characters, such as the Genie, Port Master, Oracle, Forest Fairies and Ice Fairies. These characters give the child clues, support and motivation.

== Application ==
The game is aimed at elementary school children from the second to fourth grade, but it also develops basic math skills that could benefit children in kindergarten.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, C./ Petermann, F.:''Rechenstörungen'', 2007, pp. 26-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Meister Cody – Talasia is an adaptive [[Single player video game|single player game]].

'''''Mohini Jain v. State of Karnataka''''', a 1989 Supreme Court of India case, occurred when the [[Government of Karnataka]] issued a notification that permitted the private medical colleges in the State of [[Karnataka]] to charge exorbitant [[tuition fees]] from the students admitted other than the 'Government seat quota'. Miss Mohini Jain, a medical aspirant student filed a petition in Supreme Court challenging this notification. The apex Court raised an important question that 'whether [[right to education]] is guaranteed to the Indian citizen under the [[Constitution of India]]?'

The [[Supreme Court of India]] observed that mention of 'life and personal liberty' in Article 21 of the Constitution&lt;ref name="lawmin.nic.in"&gt;[Constitution Of India. Available on Official Website of Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India.http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;  automatically implies some other rights, those are necessary for the full development of the personality, though they are not enumerated in Part III of the Constitution. [[Education]] is one such factor responsible for overall development of an individual and therefore, right to education is integrated in Article 21 of the Constitution.

== A brief on the Case ==

Miss Mohini Jain, a resident of [[Meerut]] (in the State of [[Uttar Pradesh|UP]]), applied for admission to the [[MBBS]] course in the session commencing February/March, 1991, to a private [[medical college]] located in the State of Karnataka. The college management asked her to deposit a sum of Rs. 60,000/- as the tuition fee for the first year and also to show a bank guarantee of the amount equal to the fee for the remaining years. When Miss Jain's father intimated the management that the asked amount was beyond his reach, the management denied Ms. Jain's admission to the medical college. Miss Jain informed the court that the management demanded an additional amount of Rs. four and a half [[lakh]]s, however, the management denied the allegation (?).&lt;ref name="scoi"&gt;[Official Website of Supreme Court of India. Available online at http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in]&lt;/ref&gt;

As per the notification, the denial of admission of Miss Jain due to her failure to submit the yearly tuition fee of Rs. 60,000/- was a valid step taken by the college management. In this situation, Miss Jain filed a [[petition]] (Writ petition (Civil) No. 456 of 1991) under Article 32 (1) ("The right to move the Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part (Part III: Fundamental Rights) is guaranteed")&lt;ref name="lawmin.nic.in"/&gt; of the Constitution of India challenging the notification issued by the Government of Karnataka.&lt;ref name="scoi"/&gt;

A two-member bench consisting Justice Kuldip Singh and Justice R. M. Sahai gave the judgment of the case on 30 July 1992 (1992 AIR 1858).&lt;ref name="scoi"/&gt; For the first time in the post independent India, right to education of the Indian citizens and the State obligation to secure the right came under scrutiny at the premises of the [[apex court]]. It is important to note that this was the time when [[neo-liberal]] [[economic policy]] were knocking at the door of India.

== The notification ==

It is relevant to know in this context that what was the notification issued by the Government of Karnataka. The Government of Karnataka issued a notification dated 5 June 1989 under section 5(1) of the Karnataka Educational Institutions (Prohibition of capitation fee) Act, 1984, which fixed the tuition and other fees to be charged from the students by the private medical colleges in the state. As per the notification, the tuition fee for the candidates admitted against:&lt;ref name="scoi"/&gt;

1. "Government seat" was Rs. 2,000 per year, 

2. For the students from Karnataka but not falling under "Government seat" was not to be exceeding Rs. 25,000/- per year, and

3. For the Indian students not residing in Karnataka was not to be exceeding Rs. 60,000/- per year.

== Responses from the respondents ==

First [[respondent]] was the State of Karnataka. The second (the intervener) and the third respondent were the Karnataka Private Medical Colleges Association and the private medical college respectively. According to the third respondent, the private medical college, those students who were admitted under "Government seat quota" were meritorious and those who were admitted under the "Management quota" (other than "Government seat") were not meritorious; the classification was valid and hence, in such situation, the college-management had the right to charge more fee from non-meritorious students to meet the expenses in order to provide [[medical education]] to the students.&lt;ref name="scoi"/&gt;

According to the intervener, Karnataka Private Medical Colleges Association, the private medical colleges in the state of Karnataka received no financial aid either from the State or Central Government. The expenditure per student for 5-year MBBS course in private medical colleges was about 5 lakhs and forty percent of the seats were filled by the "Government Quota" under which students paid only Rs. 2,000/- per year, therefore, students admitted under "Management quota" had to share the burden. Hence, the tuition fee was not excessive and there was no question of [[Profit (economics)|profit]] making by the private medical colleges in the State of Karnataka.&lt;ref name="scoi"/&gt;

Moreover, both the intervener and the third respondent mentioned that there were no provision either in the constitution of India or under any other law which prevented the charging of [[capitation fee]].&lt;ref name="scoi"/&gt;

== Issues before the Court ==

In the lieu of above situation several crucial questions appeared before the court. Now, the court had to answer the following major questions:

a) Was there a 'right to education' guaranteed to the people of India under the Constitution?

b) If the right is guaranteed to the people then, does applying capitation fee violate the guaranteed right to education?

c) Whether charging capitation fee in educational institutions is arbitrary, unjust, unfair and violated Article 14 ("The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India" ) of the constitution?&lt;ref name="scoi"/&gt;

== Responses from the Court ==

The court said that the dignity of human can not be violated under any situation and it is the responsibility of the state to respect and protect the dignity of her citizens. An individual cannot be assured [[human dignity]] unless his/her personality is developed and the only way to do that is to educate the individual. When the Constitution was framed (the Constitution was adopted in 1950), 70 percent of the citizens of the country were [[illiterate]]. The framers of the constitution hoped to achieve 100 percent [[literacy]] within a time period of 10 years. Guided by this hope, Article 41 ("The State shall, within the limits of its economic capacity and development, make effective provision for securing the right to work, to education and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement, and in other cases of underserved want") and Article 45 ("The State shall endeavour to provide, within a period of ten years from the commencement of this Constitution, for free and [[compulsory education]] for all children until they complete the age of fourteen years") were included in the Chapter IV of the constitution.&lt;ref name="scoi"/&gt;

The court referred to the various provisions in the Constitution of India and reminded that the 'Preamble' has promised to secure to all citizens of India "Justice, social, economic and political", "Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship". It further provided "Equality of status and of opportunity" and assured dignity of the individual. The objectives flowing from the 'Preamble' cannot be achieved and shall remain on paper unless the people in this country were educated.&lt;ref name="scoi"/&gt;

The Court said that although 'right to education' had not been guaranteed as a [[Fundamental rights|fundamental right]] under Part III of the constitution, the Articles 21 (in Part III of the Constitution of India), Article 38, 39(a), (f), 41 and 45 (in Part IV of the Constitution of India) together makes it clear that the framers of the constitution made it obligatory for the State to provide education for its citizens. Article 21 says "No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law". The [[right to life]] under Article 21 and the dignity of an individual cannot be assured unless it is accompanied by right to education. Therefore, every citizen had a 'right to education' under the constitution and thus, the state had an obligation to provide [[educational institution]]s at all levels for the benefit of all the citizens. All educational institutions whether it was state owned or state recognized were obliged to secure the 'right to education'.&lt;ref name="scoi"/&gt;

In Part IV, the directive principles of the state policy, the Constitution asks the State to secure [[social order]] and minimize inequalities for the promotion of welfare of citizens (Article 38). Article 39 of Part IV talks about directing the state policies to secure adequate means of livelihood of citizen and offer opportunities to children to facilitate their healthy al-round development. Reality of the fundamental rights under chapter III will not be realized by illiterate citizens unless "right to education" under Article 41 was ensured to the individual citizen. Therefore, "right to education" was concomitant to the fundamental rights provided under Part III of the constitution.&lt;ref name="scoi"/&gt;

The fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the constitution of India including the right to [[freedom of speech]] and expression and other rights under Article 19 cannot be appreciated and fully enjoyed unless a citizen is educated and is conscious of his individual dignity. Education is instrumental to reduce the [[Social inequality|inequality]], and ensuring adequate livelihood. Illiterate people is vulnerable to [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]]. Without education the vision expressed in the said articles of the Constitution can not be realized. The court said that the 'Directive Principles', which were fundamental in the governance of the country, cannot be isolated from the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III. They were supplementary to each other and have to be read into the fundamental rights.&lt;ref name="scoi"/&gt;

== Court's responses on charging capitation fee ==

Charging capitation fee limits the access to the education only to the richer section of the people. Poorer person with better merit can not get admission due to inability to pay money and as a consequence in educational institution a citizen's 'right to education' gets denied. Further, allowing charging capitation fee violates Article 14 of the constitution of India. The only method of admission to the medical colleges should be by [[:wikt:merit|merit]] and merit alone. The court further stated that the capitation fee was simply a price for selling education. The concept of "teaching shops" was not at par with the constitutional scheme and was entirely opposing character to the Indian culture and heritage.&lt;ref name="scoi"/&gt;

Court made one significant remark in stating that if government recognises or approve a professional institution to run a professional course, it is State responsibility to ensure that the Institute should charge the government rates only and right to education is preserved.&lt;ref name="scoi"/&gt;

== Significance of the Case ==

The judgment is historic in its own accord. The judgment of the Supreme Court has huge significance in a context of state's failure to maintain the endeavor set by article 45 of the Constitution even after 40 years of independence.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;[Tilak, J. B. (1998). Available online athttp://www.doccentre.org/docsweb/Education/Scanned_material/New-Folder/fre2.seminar98.646.pdf accessed on 11 September 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the judgment of the court resulted mixed reaction. While, some critic the court's judgment as impractical and court's role as unnecessarily proactive,&lt;ref&gt;[Sathe, S. P. (1992). Supreme Court on Right to Education . Economic and Political Weekly; 27 (35); 1847–1848.]&lt;/ref&gt; others welcomed the court's decision as logical&lt;ref name="ND &amp; SV"&gt;[Nagasaila, D and Suresh, V (1992). Can Right to Education be a Fundamental Right? Economic and Political Weekly; 27 (45); 2442–2443.]&lt;/ref&gt; and response to the call of hour.&lt;ref&gt;[Anand, A. S. (1997). Justice N.D. Krishna Rao Memorial Lecture Protection of Human Rights — Judicial Obligation or Judicial Activism. Online available athttp://www.ebc-india.com/lawyer/articles/97v7a2.htm accessed on 10 September 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; Others noted the judgment as the expression of judicial activism due to the fact that only a two judge bench made a substantial change in constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[Suchindran, B. N. (2011). An injudicious fraud. Blog post available athttp://lawandotherthings.blogspot.com/2011/02/injudicious-fraud.html accessed on 11 September 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohini Jain judgment of the Supreme Court was appeared at a time when [[liberalisation]] as a government policy was searching Indian soil to sprout. [[Commercialisation]] of education was not as rampant as it is now.&lt;ref&gt;[Times on India. available onlinehttp://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-02-21/india/28130476_1_capitation-fee-private-schools-education accessed on 10 March 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the recent trend of liberalization and [[privatization]], the scourge of commercialization of education looms large. It is a challenge to keep the conformity with the socialist structure of Constitution and the judgment is in the line of retaining the conformity.&lt;ref name="ND &amp; SV"/&gt;

The most notable part of the judgment was its insistence that the right to education be read as an integral part of the right to life guaranteed under Article 21, Part III. The decision of the Court that the fulfillment of the right to life requires a life of dignity and therefore, must be interpreted to include both the economic and social rights. Education is as basic as to ensure rights to food, water, and health. But, question arise whether right to education at all level is essential for citizens for living a descent life? Whether right to education should be limited to only right to primary and basic education? Whether, declaring right to education at higher education level actually increase status quo and unequal distribution of resources results in collapsing the entire education system in India?&lt;ref name="SP 1992"&gt;[Sathe, S. P. (1992). Supreme Court on Right to Education. Economic and Political Weekly; 27 (35); 1847–1848.]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to some critic, the private educational institutions do not get any government grants and therefore should not be interpreted under the purview of article 12 of the Constitution of India.&lt;ref name="SP 1992"/&gt; Later Supreme court had to modify its judgment and limits the right to free and compulsory education up to 14 years of age.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"/&gt;

== Conclusion ==
The most important thing is, there was a traditional look towards Directive Principle as idealistic preaching of the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[Times on India. available online at http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Schools-cant-be-allowed-to-fix-exorbitant-fees/articleshow/5600370.cms accessed on 10 March 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; This case, revisited the traditional ritualistic approach towards Directive Principles and provides a solid base of pragmatism.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

The [[Eighty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution of India|86th Amendment of the Constitution]], passed by Parliament in 2002, and which came into force on 1 April 2010, the same date as its enabling legislation (''[[Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act]], 2009''), made the Right to Education a Fundamental Right.

The '''Montessori Method of education''', developed by [[Maria Montessori]], is a child-centered educational approach based on scientific observations of children. Montessori's method has been used for over 100 years in many parts of the world.&lt;ref name="intro-to-montessori"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Montessori Method|website=American Montessori Society|url=https://amshq.org/Montessori-Education/Introduction-to-Montessori}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Montessori method views the child as one who is naturally eager for knowledge and capable of initiating learning in a supportive, thoughtfully prepared learning environment. It attempts to develop children physically, socially, emotionally and cognitively.&lt;ref name="intro-to-montessori"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Montessori Method|website=American Montessori Society|url=https://amshq.org/Montessori-Education/Introduction-to-Montessori}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a range of practices exist under the name "Montessori", the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) and the [[American Montessori Society]] (AMS) cite these elements as essential:&lt;ref name=AMI-USA&gt;{{cite web|title=AMI School Standards|url=http://amiusa.org/ami-schools/ami-school-standards|accessdate=2011-04-22|publisher=Association Montessori Internationale-USA (AMI-USA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intro-to-montessori" /&gt;
*Mixed age classrooms; classrooms for children ages 2½ or 3 to 6&amp;nbsp;years old are by far the most common, but 0–3, 3-6, 6–9, 9–12, 12–15, and 15–18 year-old classrooms exist as well.
*Student choice of activity from within a prescribed range of options. 
*Uninterrupted blocks of work time, ideally three hours.
*A [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] or "discovery" model, where students learn concepts from working with materials, rather than by direct instruction.
*Specialized educational materials developed by Montessori and her collaborators often made out of natural, aesthetic materials such as wood, rather than plastic.
* A thoughtfully prepared environment where materials are organized by subject area, within reach of the child, and are appropriate in size.
*Freedom of movement within the classroom.
*A trained Montessori teacher who follows the child and is highly experienced in observing the individual child's characteristics, tendencies, innate talents and abilities.

==History==
[[File:Edward Harden Mansion, Sleepy Hollow, NY.jpg|thumb|The [[Scarborough School]] at the [[Edward Harden Mansion]] in [[Sleepy Hollow, NY]], listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the site of the first American Montessori school in 1911|alt=A wide brick building with dormer windows projecting from its roof and a white wooden wing on the left, seen from slightly downhill]]
Following her medical training, Maria Montessori began to develop her educational philosophy and methods in 1897, attending courses in [[pedagogy]] at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] and reading the educational theory of the previous two hundred years.&lt;ref name=Kramer&gt;{{cite book|last=Kramer |first=Rita|title=Maria Montessori|year=1976|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-201-09227-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|60}} While visiting an [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]], during her schooling with a teacher, she used her observations of mistreatment of the kids there, especially those with [[autism]], to create her new form of education. In 1907, she opened her first classroom, the Casa dei Bambini, or Children's House, in a tenement building in Rome.&lt;ref name=Kramer/&gt;{{rp|112}} From the beginning, Montessori based her work on her observations of children and experimentation with the environment, materials, and lessons available to them. She frequently referred to her work as "[[Maria Montessori#Scientific pedagogy|scientific pedagogy]]".

In 1901, Maria Montessori met Alice and [[Leopoldo Franchetti]] (Baroness &amp; Baron) of [[Città di Castello]]. They found many matching points between their work. Maria Montessori was invited to hold her first course for teachers and to set up a "Casa dei Bambini" at Villa Montesca, the home of the Franchettis in Città di Castello. Maria Montessori decided to move to Città di Castello where she lived for 2 years and where she refined her methodology together with Alice Franchetti. In that period, she published her book in Città di Castello. The Franchetti Barons financed the publication of the book and the methodology had the name "Method Franchetti-Montessori". Alice Franchetti died in 1911 at the age of 37 years old.

Montessori education had spread to the United States by 1912 and became widely known in educational and popular publications. However, conflict arose between Montessori and the American educational establishment. The 1914 critical booklet ''The Montessori System Examined,'' by influential education teacher [[William Heard Kilpatrick]], limited the spread of her ideas, and they languished after 1914. Montessori education returned to the United States in 1960 and has since spread to thousands of schools there. Montessori continued to extend her work during her lifetime, developing a comprehensive model of psychological development from birth to age 24, as well as educational approaches for children ages 0 to 3, 3 to 6, and 6 to 12.

Montessori education also spread throughout the world, including Southeast Asia and [[India]], where Maria Montessori [[Montessori in India|was interned during World War II]].

==Montessori education theory==
[[File:Montessori Classroom.jpg|thumb|A Montessori classroom in the United States.]]
Montessori education is fundamentally a model of [[Developmental psychology|human development]], and an educational approach based on that model. The model has two basic principles. First, children and developing adults engage in psychological self-construction by means of interaction with their environments. Second, children, especially under the age of six, have an innate path of psychological development. Based on her observations, Montessori believed that children who are at liberty to choose and act freely within an environment prepared according to her model would act spontaneously for optimal development.

Montessori saw universal, innate characteristics in human psychology which her son and collaborator Mario Montessori identified as "human tendencies" in 1957. There is some debate about the exact list, but the following are clearly identified:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Montessori|first=Mario|title=The Human Tendencies and Montessori Education|year=1966|publisher=Association Montessori Internationale|location= Amsterdam|url=http://amiusa.org/shop/the-human-tendencies-and-montessori-education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{columns-list|colwidth=26em|
* [[Abstraction#Abstraction in psychology|Abstraction]]
* Activity
* Communication
* Exactness
* Exploration
* Manipulation (of the environment)
* Order
* Orientation
* Repetition
* Self-Perfection
* Work (also described as "purposeful activity")
}}

In the Montessori approach, these human tendencies are seen as driving behavior in every stage of development, and education should respond to and facilitate their expression.

Montessori education involves free activity within a "prepared environment", meaning an educational environment tailored to basic human characteristics, to the specific characteristics of children at different ages, and to the individual personalities of each child.&lt;ref name="Lillard2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paula Polk Lillard|title=Montessori Today: A Comprehensive Approach to Education from Birth to Adulthood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WHo6zlV1j8MC|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=7 September 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-76132-3|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The function of the environment is to help and allow the child to develop independence in all areas according to his or her inner psychological directives. In addition to offering access to the Montessori materials appropriate to the age of the children, the environment should exhibit the following characteristics:&lt;ref name=Standing&gt;{{cite book|last=Standing|first=E. M.|title=Maria Montessori: Her Life and Work|year=1957|publisher=Plume|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|263–280}}

{{columns-list|colwidth=28em|
* An arrangement that facilitates movement and activity
* Beauty and harmony, cleanliness of environment
* Construction in proportion to the child and her/his needs
* Limitation of materials, so that only material that supports the child's development is included
* Order
* Nature in the classroom and outside of the classroom
}}

===Planes of development===
Montessori observed four distinct periods, or "planes", in human development, extending from birth to 6 years, from 6 to 12, from 12 to 18, and from 18 to 24. She saw different characteristics, learning modes, and developmental imperatives active in each of these planes, and called for educational approaches specific to each period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Montessori|first=Maria|title=The Four Planes of Development|journal=AMI Communications|year=1969|issue=2/3|pages=4–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grazzini|first=Camillo|title=The Four Planes of Development: A Constructive Rhythm of Life|journal=Montessori Today|date=Jan–Feb 1988|volume=1|issue=1|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first plane extends from birth to around six years of age. During this period, Montessori observed that the child undergoes striking physical and psychological development. The first-plane child is seen as a concrete, sensorial explorer and learner engaged in the developmental work of psychological self-construction and building functional independence. Montessori introduced several concepts to explain this work, including the absorbent mind, sensitive periods, and normalization.

Montessori described the young child's behavior of effortlessly assimilating the sensorial stimuli of his or her environment, including information from the senses, language, culture, and the development of concepts with the term "absorbent mind". She believed that this is a power unique to the first plane, and that it fades as the child approached age six.&lt;ref name=Montessori1967&gt;{{cite book|last=Montessori|first=Maria|title=The Absorbent Mind|year=1967|publisher=Delta|location=New York|isbn=0-440-55056-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montessori also observed and discovered periods of special sensitivity to particular stimuli during this time which she called the "sensitive periods". In Montessori education, the classroom environment responds to these periods by making appropriate materials and activities available while the periods are active in each individual young child. She identified the following periods and their durations:&lt;ref name=Standing/&gt;{{rp|118–140}}

* [[Language acquisition|Acquisition of language]]—from birth to around 6 years old
* Interest in small objects—from around 18&amp;nbsp;months to 3 years old
* Order—from around 1 to 3 years old
* Sensory refinement—from birth to around 4 years old
* [[Social behavior]]—from around 2½ to 4 years old

Finally, Montessori observed in children from three to six years old a psychological state she termed "normalization".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.montessori-namta.org/The-Process-of-Normalization The Process of Normalization]." ''North American Montessori Teacher's Association.''&lt;/ref&gt; Normalization arises from concentration and focus on activity which serves the child's developmental needs, and is characterized by the ability to concentrate as well as "spontaneous discipline, continuous and happy work, social sentiments of help and sympathy for others."&lt;ref name=Montessori1967/&gt;{{rp|207}}

The second plane of development extends from around six years to twelve years old. During this period, Montessori observed physical and psychological changes in children, and developed a classroom environment, lessons, and materials, to respond to these new characteristics. Physically, she observed the loss of baby teeth and the lengthening of the legs and torso at the beginning of the plane, and a period of uniform growth following. Psychologically, she observed the "herd instinct", or the tendency to work and socialize in groups, as well as the powers of reason and imagination. Developmentally, she believed the work of the second plane child is the formation of intellectual independence, of moral sense, and of social organization.&lt;ref name=Montessori1994&gt;{{cite book|last=Montessori|first=Maria|title=From Childhood to Adolescence|year=1994|publisher=ABC-Clio|location=Oxford, England|isbn=1-85109-185-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–16}}

The third plane of development extends from around twelve years to around eighteen years of age, encompassing the period of [[adolescence]]. Montessori characterized the third plane by the physical changes of [[puberty]] and adolescence, but also psychological changes. She emphasized the psychological instability and difficulties in concentration of this age, as well as the creative tendencies and the development of "a sense of justice and a sense of personal dignity." She used the term "valorization" to describe the adolescents' drive for an externally derived evaluation of their worth. Developmentally, Montessori believed that the work of the third plane child is the construction of the adult self in society.&lt;ref name=Montessori1994/&gt;{{rp|59–81}}

The fourth plane of development extends from around eighteen years to around twenty-four years old. Montessori wrote comparatively little about this period and did not develop an educational program for the age. She envisioned young adults prepared by their experiences in Montessori education at the lower levels ready to fully embrace the study of culture and the sciences in order to influence and lead civilization. She believed that economic independence in the form of work for money was critical for this age, and felt that an arbitrary limit to the number of years in university level study was unnecessary, as the study of culture could go on throughout a person's life.&lt;ref name=Montessori1994/&gt;{{rp|82–93}}

In short, four core aspects of montessori school include, practical life, sensorial, math, and language arts. Some smaller aspects that could be integrated into montessori schools include geography, art, and gardening.

===Education and peace===
As Montessori developed her theory and practice, she came to believe that education had a role to play in the development of world peace.&lt;ref name=Standing/&gt;{{rp|80}} She felt that children allowed to develop according to their inner laws of development would give rise to a more peaceful and enduring civilization. From the 1930s to the end of her life, she gave a number of lectures and addresses on the subject saying in 1936,

{{quotation |Preventing conflicts is the work of politics; establishing peace is the work of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Montessori|first=Maria|title=Education and Peace|year=1992|publisher=ANC-Clio|location=Oxford|isbn=1-85109-168-8|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

She received a total of six nominations for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in a three-year period: 1949, 1950, and 1951.&lt;ref name=Kramer/&gt;{{rp|360}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/nomination/nomination.php?string=Montessori&amp;action=simplesearch |title=Nomination Database – Peace |publisher=Nobelprize.org|year= |accessdate=2011-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elementary Montessori peace curriculum starts with Five Great Lessons that give a big picture of the world and life. They are educational stories that also spark the imagination of the students. The Five Great Lessons are - The Beginning of the Universe and Earth, Life Comes to Earth, Human Come to Earth, How Writing Began, and How Numbers Began. It is important to not rush through them and give time for research in between. It is also important to share these lessons as early in the year as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://montessoritraining.blogspot.com/2009/09/introducing-and-exploring-five-great.html |title=The Five Great Lessons for Montessori Elementary: An Introduction and Lesson Idea List |publisher= North American Montessori Center |year= 2009|accessdate=2018-02-01}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Education practices==
[[File:White Pine Montessori School.jpg|thumb|300px|White Pine Montessori School in [[Moscow, Idaho]], US]]

===Infant and toddler programs===
Montessori classrooms for children under three fall into several categories, with a number of terms being used. A ''{{lang|it|nido}}'', Italian for "nest", serves a small number of children from around two months to around fourteen months, or when the child is confidently walking. A "Young Child Community" serves a larger number of children from around one year to 2½ or 3 years old. Both environments emphasize materials and activities scaled to the children's size and abilities, opportunities to develop movement, and activities to develop independence. Development of independence in toileting is typically emphasized as well. Some schools also offer "Parent-Infant" classes, in which parents participate with their very young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Montessori Infant-Toddler Program |url=http://www.montessori-namta.org/Index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=85|publisher=North American Montessori Teachers Association|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preschool and kindergarten===
Montessori classrooms for children from 2½ or 3 to 6 years old are often called Children's Houses, after Montessori's first school, the Casa dei Bambini in Rome in 1906. This level is also called "Primary". A typical classroom serves 20 to 30 children in mixed-age groups, staffed by fully trained teachers and assistants. Classrooms are usually outfitted with child-sized tables and chairs arranged singly or in small clusters, with classroom materials on child-height shelves throughout the room. Activities are for the most part initially presented by the teacher, after which they may be chosen more or less freely by the children as interest dictates. Classroom materials usually include activities for engaging in practical skills such as pouring and spooning, washing up, scrubbing tables and sweeping. Also materials for the development of the senses, mathematical materials, language materials, music, art and cultural materials, including more science based activities like 'sink and float', Magnetic and Non magnetic and candle and air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Montessori Preschool Program|url=http://www.montessori-namta.org/Index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=86|publisher=North American Montessori Teachers Association|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activities in Children's Houses are typically hands on, tactile materials to teach concepts. For example, to teach writing, students use sandpaper letters. These are letters created by cutting letters out of sandpaper and placing them on wooden blocks. The children then trace these letters with their fingers to learn the shape and sound of each letter. Another example is the use of bead chains to teach math concepts, specifically multiplication. Specifically for multiples of 10, there is one bead that represents one unit, a bar of ten beads put together that represents 1×10, then a flat shape created by fitting 10 of the bars together to represent 10×10, and a cube created by fitting 10 of the flats together to represent 10×10×10. These materials help build a concrete understanding of basic concepts upon which much is built in the later years.

===Elementary classrooms===
Elementary school classrooms usually serve mixed-age 6- to 9-year-old and 9- to 12-year-old groupings; 6- to 12-year-old groups are also used. Lessons are typically presented to small groups of children, who are then free to follow up with independent work of their own as interest and personal responsibility dictate. Montessori educators give interdisciplinary lessons examining subjects ranging from biology and history to theology, which they refer to as "great lessons." These are typically given near the beginning of the school term and provide the basis for learning throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourkids.net/montessori-schools.php Guide to Montessori Education].&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessons include work in language, mathematics, history, the sciences, the arts, etc. Student-directed explorations of resources outside the classroom are integral to the education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Montessori Elementary Program|url=http://www.montessori-namta.org/Index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=87|publisher=North American Montessori Teachers Association|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montessori used the term "cosmic education" to indicate both the universal scope of lessons to be presented, and the idea that education should help children realize the human role in the interdependent functioning of the universe.

===Middle and high school===
Montessori education for this level is less well-developed than programs for younger children. Montessori did not establish a teacher training program or a detailed plan of education for adolescents during her lifetime. However, a number of schools have extended their programs for younger children to the middle school and high school levels. In addition, several Montessori organizations have developed teacher training or orientation courses and a loose consensus on the plan of study is emerging. Montessori wrote that, "The essential reform of our plan from this point of view may be defined as follows: during the difficult time of adolescence it is helpful to leave the accustomed environment of the family in town and to go to quiet surroundings in the country, close to nature".&lt;ref&gt;Montessori, 1989, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Montessori schools for adolescents 12–18 are set in rural locations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Lillard (2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lillard|first=Angeline|title=Montessori: The Science Behind the Genius|year=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-19-998152-6|pages=351–376}}&lt;/ref&gt; reviews recent research on the outcomes of Montessori education. A 2006 study published in [[Science (journal)|''Science'' magazine]] found that "when strictly implemented, Montessori education fosters social and academic skills that are equal or superior to those fostered by a pool of other types of schools."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lillard|first1=Angeline|last2=Else-Quest|first2=Nicole|title=Evaluating Montessori Education|journal=Science|date=29 September 2006|volume=313|page=1894|url=http://www.montessori-science.org/Science_Evaluating_Montessori_Education_Lillard.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study had a relatively small sample size and was severely criticized&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindenfors|first=Patrik|date=2007-02-02|title=Studying Students in Montessori Schools|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/315/5812/596.2|journal=Science|language=en|volume=315|issue=5812|pages=596–597|doi=10.1126/science.315.5812.596b|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17272701}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Another study in the Milwaukee Public Schools found that children who had attended Montessori from ages 3–11 outperformed their high school classmates several years later on mathematics and science;&lt;ref&gt;Dohrmann KR, Nishida TK, Gartner A, Lipsky DK, Grimm KJ (2007). "High school outcomes for students previously in a public Montessori program", ''Journal of Research in Childhood Education'' 22/2, pp. 205–217&lt;/ref&gt; another found that Montessori had some of the largest positive effects on achievement of all programs evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;Borman,2003, ''Review of Education Research''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have not found positive outcomes for children in Montessori classrooms, but this might be due to the implementation of Montessori. For example, a 2005 study in a Buffalo public Montessori magnet school "...failed to support the hypothesis that enrollment in a Montessori school was associated with higher academic achievement."&lt;ref&gt;Lopata, Christopher; Wallace, Nancy V; Finn, Kristin V (2005). "Comparison of Academic Achievement Between Montessori and Traditional Education Programs", ''Journal of Research in Childhood Education'' 20/1, pp. 5–13&lt;/ref&gt; Explicitly comparing outcomes of Montessori classrooms in which children spent a lot of time with Montessori materials, less time with the Montessori materials, or no time at all with the materials (because they were in conventional classrooms), Lillard&lt;ref&gt;Lillard, A. S. (2012) Preschool children's development in classic Montessori, supplemented Montessori, and conventional programs, "Journal of School Psychology", 50/3, pp. 379–401&lt;/ref&gt; found the best outcomes for children in classic Montessori. Further research should take care to determine the fidelity of the program.

The review on evaluations of Montessori education studies, that was published in 2017, states that wide evidence exist that certain elements of the Montessori method (e.g. teaching early literacy through a phonic approach embedded in a rich language context, and providing a sensorial foundation for mathematics education) are effective. At the same time it was concluded that while some evidence exist that children may benefit cognitively and socially from Montessori education which sticks to original principles, it is less clear whether modern adapted forms of Montessori education are as effective.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Chloë; [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-017-0012-7 Montessori education: a review of the evidence base], "npj Science of Learning", Volume 2, id. 11 (10/2017) &lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of terminology==
In 1967, the US Patent Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ruled that "the term 'Montessori' has a generic and/or descriptive significance."&lt;ref&gt;American Montessori Society, Inc. v. Association Montessori Internationale, 155 U.S.P.Q. 591, 592 (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in the United States and most other countries, the term can be used freely without giving any guarantee of how closely, if at all, a program applies Montessori's work. The ruling has led to "tremendous variation in schools claiming to use Maria Montessori's methods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://humboldt.edu/cdblog/CD356-Hansen/montessori/|title=CD356-Hansen, Curriculum Development for Early Childhood-Montessori|author=(Staff writer(s); no by-line.)|publisher=Humboldt State University|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
With the development of mobile touchscreen devices, several Montessori activities were made into mobile apps for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2012/08/dev-lescapadou/|title=On Making Montessori Apps for the iPhone|author=Daniel Donahod|work=Wired|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2012/06/lettersounds/|title=Montessori Letter Sounds:Another Winning App from Les Trois Elles|author=Kristen Rutherford|work=Wired|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Dinosaur Museum''' is Australia's largest permanent display of prehistoric  specimens, located in Gold Creek Village near [[Canberra]], [[Australian Capital Territory]], [[Australia]]. The museum's exhibition follows the [[evolution]] of  life, with a particular focus on [[dinosaur]]s.

With an annual patronage of 100,000  visitors, the museum is one of the most popular attractions in the Australian Capital Territory. The gift shop stocks a range of natural history books, dinosaur replicas, toys, fossils, crystals, minerals and meteorites. 

Established in 1993, the museum has been steadily improved and updated since its conception. It offers earth science dinosaur oriented  displays that keep up with most recent discoveries  in the geological sciences. New directors have been appointed in September 2011 including local and  international scientists and geologists. Major upgrades have 
taken place in April and May 2012 with the addition of twelve [[animatronic]] dinosaurs as well as an extensive collection of life size models displayed both within and outside the museum.
The museum caters for guided tours for school groups of all ages by appointment, as well as hosting birthday parties, dance with dinosaurs events for young children, private parties, corporate functions and dinosaur sleep overs during school holiday periods. 
New displays of Australian dinosaurs,  earth sciences including meteorites, [[fluorescent mineral]] displays are planned for late 2012 and 2013.

Opening hours are 10am to 5 pm  seven days a week including public holidays, but are closed Christmas Day. After hours visits are available by appointment only .

A '''national trust''' is an organisation dedicated to preserving the [[cultural heritage]] of a particular geographic region. Although the focus of a national trust may vary by region, the principal role is to ensure the preservation of historically significant items, and to conserve areas of natural beauty. National trusts generally operate as private non-profit organizations. The first such trust organisation, [[The Trustees of Reservations]], originated in 1890 as a regional group serving the state of [[Massachusetts]], USA.&lt;ref name="INTOmovement"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.internationaltrusts.org/5366 | title=The National Trust Movement | publisher=International National Trusts Organisation | date=23 May 2014 | accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first national trust, the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]], was founded in England in 1895 and operates as a [[charitable organisation]] serving England, [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] (it is commonly known in the UK as the National Trust). Other national trusts have since been set up around the world.&lt;ref name="INTOmovement" /&gt;&lt;ref name=colwell&gt;Max Colwell, David Colwell, ''Heritage Preserved with the National Trust of South Australia'' (1985), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=movement&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ntlc.ca/?page_id=470 | title=The National Trust Movement | publisher=National Trust for Land &amp; Culture | accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the [[International National Trusts Organisation]] (INTO) was established at a gathering in [[New Delhi]], India, with a mandate to support collaboration and [[best practices]] among national trusts and similar associations. It has member organisations from over 50 countries.&lt;ref name=movement /&gt;&lt;ref name=into-about&gt;{{cite web | url=http://internationaltrusts.org/about-into | title=About INTO| publisher=International National Trusts Organisation | accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=into-members&gt;{{cite web | url=http://internationaltrusts.org/into-members | title=INTO Members | publisher=International National Trusts Organisation | accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Outcome-based education''' (OBE) is an educational theory that bases each part of an educational system around goals (outcomes). By the end of the educational experience, each student should have achieved the goal. There is no single specified style of teaching or assessment in OBE; instead, classes, opportunities, and assessments should all help students achieve the specified outcomes.&lt;ref name=Spady&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spady|first1=William|title=Outcome-Based Education: Critical Issues and Answers|date=1994|publisher=American Association of School Administrators|location=Arlington Virginia|isbn=0876521839|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED380910.pdf|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the faculty adapts into instructor, trainer, facilitator, and/or mentor based on the outcomes targeted.

Outcome-based methods have been adopted in education systems around the world, at multiple levels. 
Australia and South Africa adopted OBE policies in the early 1990s but have since been phased out.&lt;ref name=Donnelly /&gt;&lt;ref name=Allais /&gt; The United States has had an OBE program in place since 1994 that has been adapted over the years.&lt;ref name=Austin /&gt;&lt;ref name=USDE /&gt; In 2005, Hong Kong adopted an outcome-based approach for its universities.&lt;ref name=Kennedy /&gt; Malaysia implemented OBE in all of their public schools systems in 2008.&lt;ref name=Mohayidin /&gt; The European Union has proposed an education shift to focus on outcomes, across the EU.&lt;ref name="EUComm_pressrelease_dec2012" /&gt; In an international effort to accept OBE, The [[Washington Accord]] was created in 1989; it is an agreement to accept undergraduate engineering degrees that were obtained using OBE methods. As of 2017, the full signatories are Australia, Canada, Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, China and the United States.&lt;ref name=Signatories&gt;{{cite web|title=Washington Accord|url=http://www.washingtonaccord.org/Washington-Accord/signatories.cfm|work=International Engineering Alliance|publisher=International Engineering Alliance|accessdate=2 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126021804/http://www.washingtonaccord.org/Washington-Accord/signatories.cfm|archivedate=26 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from traditional education methods==
In a regional/local/foundational/electrical education system, students are given grades and rankings compared to each other. Content and performance expectations are based primarily on what was taught in the past to students of a given age of 12-18. The goal of this education was to present the knowledge and skills of an older generation to the new generation of students, and to provide students with an environment in which to learn. The process paid little attention (beyond the classroom teacher) to whether or not students learn any of the material.&lt;ref&gt;"The Harmful Effects of Algorithms in Grades 1--4", by Constance Kamii &amp; Ann Dominique in The Teaching and Learning of Asymptote in School Mathematics (NCTM Yearbook, 1998):"The teaching of algorithms is based on the erroneous assumption that mathematics is a cultural heritage that must be transmitted to the next generation." (p.132)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits of OBE==

===Clarity===
The focus on outcomes creates a clear expectation of what needs to be accomplished by the end of the course. Students will understand what is expected of them and teachers will know what they need to teach during the course. Clarity is important over years of schooling and when team teaching is involved. Each team member, or year in school, will have a clear understanding of what needs to be accomplished in each class, or at each level, allowing students to progress.&lt;ref name=Tam&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tam|first1=Maureen|title=Outcomes-based approach to quality assessment and curriculum improvement in higher education.|journal=Quality Assurance In Education|date=2014|volume=22|issue=2|pages=158–168|doi=10.1108/QAE-09-2011-0059}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those designing and planning the curriculum are expected to work backwards once an outcome has been decided upon; they must determine what knowledge and skills will be required to reach the outcome.&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Mollie|title=OUTCOMES BASED/ OUTCOMES FOCUSED EDUCATION OVERVIEW|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flexibility===
With a clear sense of what needs to be accomplished, instructors will be able to structure their lessons around the student’s needs. OBE does not specify a specific method of instruction, leaving instructors free to teach their students using any method. Instructors will also be able to recognize diversity among students by using various teaching and assessment techniques during their class.&lt;ref name=Tam /&gt; OBE is meant to be a [[Student-centred learning|student-centered learning]] model. Teachers are meant to guide and help the students understand the material in any way necessary, study guides, and group work are some of the methods instructors can use to facilitate students learning.&lt;ref name=Malan&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malan|first1=SPT|title=The 'new paradigm' of outcomes-based education in perspective|journal=Tydskrif vir Gesinsekologie en Verbruikerswetenskappe|date=2000|volume=28|url=http://reforma.fen.uchile.cl/Papers/The%20new%20paradigm%20of%20outcomes-based%20education%20in%20perspective%20-%20SPT%20Malan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison===
OBE can be compared across different institutions. On an individual level, institutions can look at what outcomes a student has achieved to decide what level the student would be at within a new institution. On an institutional level, institutions can compare themselves, by checking to see what outcomes they have in common, and find places where they may need improvement, based on the achievement of outcomes at other institutions.&lt;ref name=Tam /&gt; The ability to compare easily across institutions allows students to move between institutions with relative ease. The institutions can compare outcomes to determine what credits to award the student. The clearly articulated outcomes should allow institutions to assess the student’s achievements rapidly, leading to increased movement of students. These outcomes also work for school to work transitions. A potential employer can look at records of the potential employee to determine what outcomes they have achieved. They can then determine if the potential employee has the skills necessary for the job.&lt;ref name=Tam /&gt;

===Involvement===
Student involvement in the classroom is a key part of OBE. Students are expected to do their own learning, so that they gain a full understanding of the material. Increased student involvement allows students to feel responsible for their own learning, and they should learn more through this individual learning.&lt;ref name=Malan /&gt; Other aspects of involvement are parental and community, through developing curriculum, or making changes to it. OBE outcomes are meant to be decided upon within a school system, or at a local level. Parents and community members are asked to give input in order to uphold the standards of education within a community and to ensure that students will be prepared for life after school.&lt;ref name=Malan /&gt;

==Drawbacks of OBE==

===Definition===
The definitions of the outcomes decided upon are subject to interpretation by those implementing them. Across different programs or even different instructors outcomes could be interpreted differently, leading to a difference in education, even though the same outcomes were said to be achieved.&lt;ref name=Tam /&gt; By outlining specific outcomes, a holistic approach to learning is lost. Learning can find itself reduced to something that is specific, measurable, and observable. As a result, outcomes are not yet widely recognized as a valid way of conceptualizing what learning is about.&lt;ref name=Tam /&gt;

===Assessment problems===
When determining if an outcome has been achieved, assessments may become too mechanical, looking only to see if the student has acquired the knowledge. The ability to use and apply the knowledge in different ways may not be the focus of the assessment. The focus on determining if the outcome has been achieved leads to a loss of understanding and learning for students, who may never be shown how to use the knowledge they have gained.&lt;ref name=Tam /&gt; Instructors are faced with a challenge: they must learn to manage an environment that can become fundamentally different from what they are accustomed to. In regards to giving assessments, they must be willing to put in the time required to create a valid, reliable assessment that ideally would allow students to demonstrate their understanding of the information, while remaining objective.&lt;ref name=Malan /&gt;

=== Generality ===
Education outcomes can lead to a constrained nature of teaching and assessment. Assessing liberal outcomes such as creativity, respect for self and others, responsibility, and self-sufficiency, can become problematic. There is not a measurable, observable, or specific way to determine if a student has achieved these outcomes. Due to the nature of specific outcomes, OBE may actually work against its ideals of serving and creating individuals that have achieved many outcomes.&lt;ref name=Tam /&gt;

===Involvement===
Parental involvement, as discussed in the benefits section can also be a drawback, if parents and community members are not willing to express their opinions on the quality of the education system, the system may not see a need for improvement, and not change to meet student’s needs. Parents may also become too involved, requesting too many changes, so that important improvements get lost with other changes that are being suggested.&lt;ref name=Malan /&gt; Instructors will also find that their work is increased; they must work to first understand the outcome, then build a curriculum around each outcome they are required to meet. Instructors have found that implementing multiple outcomes is difficult to do equally, especially in primary school. Instructors will also find their work load increased if they chose to use an assessment method that evaluates students holistically.&lt;ref name=Donnelly /&gt;

==Adoption and removal==

===Australia===
In the early 1990s, all states and territories in Australia developed intended curriculum documents largely based on OBE for their primary and secondary schools. Criticism arose shortly after implementation.&lt;ref name=Donnelly /&gt; Critics argued that no evidence existed that OBE could be implemented successfully on a large scale, in either the United States or Australia. An evaluation of Australian schools found that implementing OBE was difficult. Teachers felt overwhelmed by the amount of expected achievement outcomes. Educators believed that the curriculum outcomes did not attend to the needs of the students or teachers. Critics felt that too many expected outcomes left students with shallow understanding of the material. Many of Australia’s current education policies have moved away from OBE and towards a focus on fully understanding the essential content, rather than learning more content with less understanding.&lt;ref name=Donnelly&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Donnelly|first1=Kevin|title=Australia’s adoption of outcomes based education – a critique|journal=Issues in Educational Research|date=2007|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED501707.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Western Australia ====
Officially, an agenda to implement Outcomes Based Education took place between 1992 and 2008 in Western Australia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news.com.au/news/wa-dumps-controversial-obe/news-story/a0d09002d5a188e1cdf5c58e321d13ac|title=WA dumps Outcomes Based Education (OBE)|last=AAP|first=|date=20 October 2009|work=News.com.au|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dissatisfaction with OBE escalated from 2004 when the government proposed the implementation of an alternative assessment system using OBE 'levels' for years 11 and 12. With government school teachers not permitted to publicly express dissatisfaction with the new system, a community lobby group called [[PLATO WA|PLATO]] as formed in June 2004 by high school science teacher Marko Vojkavi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://platowa.com/documents/History.html|title=A Short History of PLATO|last=|first=|date=|work=PLATO WA|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026185807/http://platowa.com/documents/History.html|archive-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers anonymously expressed their views through the website and online forums, with the website quickly became one of the most widely read educational websites in Australia with more 180,000 hits per month and contained an archive of more than 10,000 articles on the subject of OBE implementation. In 2008 it was officially abandoned by the state government with Minister for Education [[Mark McGowan]] remarking that the 1990s fad "to dispense with syllabus" was over.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===European Union===
In December 2012, the [[European Commission]] presented a new strategy to decrease youth unemployment rate, which at the time was close to 23% across the European Union [http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:Unemployment_rate_EU-28_2007-2016,_%25.PNG]. The [[European Qualifications Framework]] calls for a shift towards learning outcomes in primary and secondary schools throughout the EU. Students are expected to learn skills that they will need when they complete their education. It also calls for lessons to have a stronger link to employment through [[work-based learning]] (WBL). Work-based learning for students should also lead to recognition of [[Vocational education|vocational training]] for these students. The program also sets goals for learning foreign languages, and for teachers continued education. It also highlights the importance of using technology, especially the internet, in learning to make it relevant to students.&lt;ref name="EUComm_pressrelease_dec2012" /&gt;

===Hong Kong===
[[University Grants Committee (Hong Kong)|Hong Kong’s University Grants Committee]] adopted an outcomes-based approach to teaching and learning in 2005. No specific approach was created leaving universities to design the approach themselves. Universities were also left with a goal of ensuring an education for their students that will contribute to social and economic development, as defined by the community in which the university resides. With little to no direction or feedback from the outside universities will have to determine if their approach is achieving its goals on their own.&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kennedy|first1=Kerry|title=Conceptualising quality improvement in higher education: policy, theory and practice for outcomes based learning in Hong Kong.|journal=Journal of Higher Education Policy &amp; Management|date=2011|volume=33|issue=3|pages=205–218|doi=10.1080/1360080X.2011.564995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaysia===
OBE has been practiced in Malaysia since the 1950s; however, as of 2008, OBE is being implemented at all levels of education, especially tertiary education. This change is a result of the belief that the education system used prior to OBE inadequately prepared graduates for life outside of school.&lt;ref name=Mohayidin&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mohayidin|first1=Mohd Ghazali|title=Implementation of Outcome-Based Education in Universiti Putra Malaysia:  A Focus on Students’ Learning Outcomes|journal=International Education Studies|date=2008|volume=1|issue=4|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:-VZLe4fUpsAJ:www.researchgate.net/publication/42386062_Implementation_of_Outcome-Based_Education_in_Universiti_Putra_Malaysia_A_Focus_on_Students_Learning_Outcomes/links/02e7e51c9628d395e0000000+&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ministry of Higher Education (Malaysia)|The Ministry of Higher Education]] has pushed for this change because of the number of unemployed graduates. Findings in 2006 state that nearly 70% of graduates from public universities were considered unemployed. A further study of those graduates found that they felt they lacked, job experience, communication skills, and qualifications relevant to the current job market. The [[Malaysian Qualifications Agency]] (MQA) was created to oversee quality of education and to ensure outcomes were being reached.&lt;ref name=Kaliannan&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaliannan|first1=Maniam|last2=Chandran|first2=Suseela Devi|title=Empowering Students through Outcome-Based Education (OBE)|journal=Research In Education|date=2012|volume=87|issue=1|pages=50–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MQA created a [[Malaysian Qualifications Framework|framework]] that includes eight levels of qualification within higher education, covering three sectors; skills, vocational and technical, and academic.&lt;ref name=MQA&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaysian Qualifications Framework|url=http://www.mqa.gov.my/|website=Malaysian Qualifications Agency|accessdate=23 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011033622/http://www.mqa.gov.my/|archivedate=11 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with meeting the standards set by the MQA, universities set and monitor their own outcome expectations for students &lt;ref name=Kaliannan /&gt;

=== South Africa ===
OBE was introduced to [[South Africa]] in the late 1990s by the post-[[apartheid]] government as part of its Curriculum 2005 program. [http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/article536849.ece/A-brief-history-of-a-system], Initial support for the program derived from anti-apartheid education policies. The policy also gained support from the labor movements that borrowed ideas about [[Competency-based learning|competency-based education]], and [[Vocational education]] from New Zealand and Australia, as well as the labor movement that critiqued the apartheid education system. With no strong alternative proposals, the idea of outcome-based education, and a national qualification framework, became the policy of the [[African National Congress]] government. This policy was believed to be a democratization of education, people would have a say in what they wanted the outcomes of education to be. It was also believed to be a way to increase education standards and increase the availability of education. The National Qualifications Framework (NQF) went into effect in 1997. In 2001 people realized that the intended effects were not being seen. By 2006 no proposals to change the system had been accepted by the government, causing a hiatus of the program.&lt;ref name=Allais&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allais|first1=Stephanie|title=Education service delivery: the disastrous case of outcomes-based qualifications frameworks.|journal=Progress in Development Studies|date=2007|volume=7|issue=1|pages=65–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program came to be viewed as a failure and a new curriculum improvement process was announced in 2010, slated to be implemented between 2012 and 2014.&lt;ref name=Mouton&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mouton|first1=M|last2=Louw|first2=G.P.|last3=Strydom|first3=G.L.|title=A Historical Analysis of the Post-Apartheid Dispensation Education in South Africa (1994-2011)|journal=International Business &amp; Economics Research Journal|date=2012|volume=11|issue=11|url=http://www.nwu.ac.za/sites/www.nwu.ac.za/files/files/p-fasrek/pdf/2012/MOUTON%20et%20al%20%282012%29%20A%20Historical%20Analysis%20Of%20The%20Post-Apartheid%20Dispensation%20Education%20In%20South%20Africa%20%281994-2011%29.pdf|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 1983, a report from the National Commission on Excellence in Education declared that American education standards were eroding, that young people in the United States were not learning enough. In 1989, [[George H. W. Bush|President Bush]] and the nation’s governors set national goals to be achieved by the year 2000.&lt;ref name=Manno&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manno|first1=Bruno|title=Outcome-Based Education: Has It Become More Affliction Than Cure?|journal=Center of the American Experiment|date=1994|url=http://www.americanexperiment.org/publications/reports/outcome-based-education-has-it-become-more-affliction-than-cure|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Goals 2000|GOALS 2000]]: Educate America Act was signed in March 1994.&lt;ref name=Austin&gt;{{cite web|last1=Austin|first1=Tammy|title=GOALS 2000--THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION EDUCATION PROGRAM|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~rbarger/www7/goals200.html|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this new reform was to show that results were being achieved in schools. In 2001, the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] took the place of [[Goals 2000]]. It mandated certain measurements as a condition of receiving federal education funds. States are free to set their own standards, but the federal law mandates public reporting of math and reading test scores for disadvantaged demographic subgroups, including racial minorities, low-income students, and special education students. Various consequences for schools that do not make "adequate yearly progress" are included in the law. In 2010, President Obama proposed improvements for the program. In 2012, the U.S. Department of Education invited states to request flexibility waivers in exchange for rigorous plans designed to improve students' education in the state.&lt;ref name=USDE&gt;{{cite web|title=NCLB ESEA Flexibility|url=http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/guid/esea-flexibility/index.html|website=U.S. Department of Education|publisher=U.S. Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
[[India]] has become the permanent signatory member of the [[Washington Accord]] on 13 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbaind.org/En/1033-washington-accord.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206071035/http://nbaind.org/En/1033-washington-accord.aspx |archivedate=2015-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]] has started implementing OBE in higher technical education like diploma and undergraduate programmes. [[National Board of Accreditation|The National Board of Accreditation]], a body for promoting international quality standards for technical education in [[India]] has started accrediting only the programmes running with OBE from 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nbaind.org/En/1055-learning-resources.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307172644/http://nbaind.org/En/1055-learning-resources.aspx |archivedate=2016-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Board of Accreditation|The National Board of Accreditation]] mandates establishing a culture of outcomes-based education in institutions that offer Engineering, Pharmacy, Management programs. Outcomes analysis and using the analytical reports to find gaps and carry out continuous improvement is essential cultural shift from how the above programs are run when OBE culture is not embraced. Outcomes analysis requires huge amount of data to be churned and made available at anytime, anywhere. Such an access to scalable, accurate, automated and real-time data analysis is possible only if the institute adopts either excelsheet based measurement system or some kind of home-grown or commercial software system. It is observed that excelsheet based measurement and analysis system doesn't scale when the stakeholders want to analyse longitudinal data. There are products like [http://www.inpods.com/ inpods] which are available in India for implementing a culture of outcomes based education for Engineering, Pharmacy, Management programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15032">{{short description|The act of rehearsing a behavior repeatedly; sessions scheduled for the purpose of rehearsing and performance improvement}}
'''Practice''' or '''practise''' is the act of rehearsing a behavior over and over, or engaging in an activity again and again, for the purpose of improving or mastering it, as in the phrase "practise makes perfect". Sports teams practise to prepare for actual games. Playing a musical instrument well takes a lot of practise. It is a method of learning and of acquiring experience. The word derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "πρακτική" (''praktike''), feminine of "πρακτικός" (''praktikos''), "fit for or concerned with action, practical",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpraktiko%2Fs πρακτικός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; and that from the verb "πράσσω" (''prasso''), "to achieve, bring about, effect, accomplish".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpra%2Fssw πράσσω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; In [[American English]], ''practise'' is used as both a [[noun]] and a [[verb]], but in [[British English]], there is a distinction between ''practice'', used as a noun, and ''practise'', used as a verb (see [[American and British English spelling differences#-ce.2C -se|spelling differences]]).

Sessions scheduled for the purpose of rehearsing and performance improvement are called '''practises'''. They are engaged in by sports teams, bands, individuals, etc. "He went to football practise every day after school", for example

==Common types==
[[File:Bio2.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[musician]] practicing his instrument.]]
[[File:ANCOP officers.jpg|thumb|300px|ANCOP officer cadets practice detaining an armed insurgent at the Mazar-e Sharif Regional Training Center on December 12, 2010.]]
Some common ways practise is applied:
*To learn how to play a [[musical instrument]] ([[musical technique]])
*To improve athletic or team performance
*To prepare for a public performance within the performing arts
*To improve [[Reading (activity)|reading]], [[writing]], [[interpersonal communication]], [[typing]], [[grammar]], and [[spelling]]
*To enhance or refine a newly acquired skill
*To maintain skill
*To learn martial arts; [[kata]] and [[sparring]] are common forms of practice
*To master tasks associated with one's occupation (e.g. a cashier using a [[Point of sale system|POS system]])
{{Refimprove section|July 2011|date=July 2011}}

How well one improves with practice depends on several factors, such as the frequency it is engaged in, and the type of feedback that is available for improvement. If feedback is not appropriate (either from an instructor or from self-reference to an information source), then the practice tends to be ineffective or even detrimental to learning. If a student does not practise often enough, reinforcement fades, and he or she is likely to forget what was learned. Therefore, practice is often scheduled, to ensure enough of it is performed to reach one's training objectives. How much practice is required depends upon the nature of the activity, and upon each individual. Some people improve on a particular activity faster than others. Practice in an instructional setting may be effective if repeated only 1 time (for some simple verbal information) or 3 times (for concepts), or it may be practised many times before evaluation (a dance movement).

==Deliberate practice ==
Psychologist [[K. Anders Ericsson]], a professor of Psychology at [[Florida State University]], has been a pioneer in researching deliberate practice and what it means. According to Ericsson:

&lt;blockquote&gt;People believe that because expert performance is qualitatively different from a normal performance the expert performer must be endowed with characteristics qualitatively different from those of normal adults. [...] We agree that expert performance is qualitatively different from normal performance and even that expert performers have characteristics and abilities that are qualitatively different from or at least outside the range of those of normal adults. However, we deny that these differences are immutable, that is, due to innate talent. Only a few exceptions, most notably height, are genetically prescribed. Instead, we argue that the differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;K. Anders Ericsson, Ralf Th. Krampe, and Clemens Tesch-Romer. ''The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance.'' Psychological Review 1993, Vol. 100. No. 3, 363-406 [http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/DeliberatePractice(PsychologicalReview).pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of Ericsson's core findings is that how expert one becomes at a skill has more to do with how one practices than with merely performing a skill a large number of times. An expert breaks down the skills that are required to be expert and focuses on improving those skill chunks during practice or day-to-day activities, often paired with immediate coaching feedback. Another important feature of deliberate practice lies in continually practicing a skill at more challenging levels with the intention of mastering it.&lt;ref name="Mayer, R. E. 2008"&gt;Mayer, R. E. (2008). ''Learning and Instruction.''  Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Deliberate practice is also discussed in the books ''Talent is Overrated'' by [[Geoff Colvin]]&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Colvin, ''Talent is Overrated: What Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else''&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Talent Code'' by Daniel Coyle,&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Coyle, ''The Talent Code: Greatness Isn't Born. It's Grown. Here's How''&lt;/ref&gt; among others. This includes, ''Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance,'' by [[Angela Duckworth]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/953827740|title=Grit : the power of passion and perseverance|last=Angela|first=Duckworth,|isbn=1501111108|oclc=953827740}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Outliers: The Story of Success,'' by [[Malcolm Gladwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/605428328|title=Featured book review : Outliers.|last=1963-|first=Gladwell, Malcolm,|last2=Summaries.|first2=Soundview Executive Book|date=2009-01-01|publisher=[Soundview Executive Book Summaries]|isbn=0316017922|oclc=605428328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duckworth describes how deliberate practice affects education, motivation, and learning outcomes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a presentation she gave at the American Educational Research Conference in 2014,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aera.net/Events-Meetings/Annual-Meeting/Previous-Annual-Meetings/2014-Annual-Meeting/2014-Annual-Meeting-Webcasts/-Noncognitive-Factors-Affecting-Student-Success|title=Noncognitive Factors Affecting Student Success:|website=www.aera.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; she spoke about the importance of grit – of student's focusing on material with which they struggle.  In her view, grit allows a student to persevere and succeed in the face of adversity. Duckworth says that if a student can apply grit in their academic work, their effort will increase. Duckworth says that effort is equally important as talent in achieving academic goals. In a study she conducted at the National Spelling Bee in Washington, D.C, she found that the students who used the grit tactic tended to advance to the finals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

Two recent articles in ''[[Current Directions in Psychological Science]]'' criticize deliberate practice and argue that, while it is necessary for reaching high levels of performance, it is not sufficient, with other factors such as talent being important as well.&lt;ref&gt;Guillermo Campitelli &amp; [[Fernand Gobet]] (2011), ''Deliberate practice: Necessary but not sufficient.'' ''Current Directions in Psychological Science'', 20, 280-285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Zachary Hambrick &amp; Elizabeth Meinz (2011), ''Limits on the predictive power of domain-specific experience and knowledge in skilled performance.'' ''Current Directions in Psychological Science'', 20, 275-279.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Malcolm Gladwell's point-of-view about deliberate practice is different from Ericsson's view.  Gladwell, staff writer at ''The New Yorker'' magazine and author of five books on The New York Times Best Seller list including ''Outliers: The Story of Success'' said in a May 2016 Freakonomics podcast interview that, "He's [Ericsson] a hard practice guy, and I'm a soft practice guy." Gladwell claims that talent is important with an intentional dedication to practice and having a support system is vital to produce superior outcomes. It is not all about methodical effort as Ericsson claims.

==Behavioral versus cognitive theories of deliberate practice==
Behavioral theory would argue that deliberate practice is facilitated by feedback from an expert that allows for successful approximation of the target performance. Feedback from an expert allows the learner to minimize errors and frustration that results from trial-and-error attempts. Behavioral theory does not require delivery of rewards for accurate performance; the expert feedback in combination with the accurate performance serve as the consequences that establish and maintain the new performance.

In cognitive theory, excellent performance results from practising complex tasks that produce errors. Such errors provide the learner with rich feedback that results in scaffolding for future performance. Cognitive theory explains how a learner can become an expert (or someone who has mastered a domain).&lt;ref name="Mayer, R. E. 2008"/&gt;

==Motivation==
Learning is closely linked to practice and [[motivation]]. [[Cultural-historical psychology|Sociocultural theory]] applied to motivation of practice suggests that motivation resides not within the individual, but within the domain of social and cultural contexts united by shared action and activity.  Thus, motivation to practice is not simply within the locus of the individual (see [[Motivation#Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation]]), but rather the locus is the activity and its specific contexts of which the individual is a participant. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rueda, Robert|author2=Moll, Luis C.|editor1-last=O'Neil, Jr|editor1-first=Harold F.|editor2-last=Drillings|editor2-first=Michael|title=Motivation: Theory and Research|date=1994|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Hillsdale, NJ|chapter=Chapter 7 A sociocultural perspective on motivation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[K. Anders Ericsson]] writes about motivation to practice.  He creates a theoretical framework for acquisition of expert performance that discusses the issue of a lack of motivation to practice.  He writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;Engagement in deliberate practice is not inherently motivating. Performers consider it instrumental in achieving further improvements in performance (the motivational constraint). The lack of inherent reward or enjoyment in practice as distinct from the enjoyment of the result (improvement) is consistent with the fact that individuals in a domain rarely initiate practice spontaneously.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The motivational constraint, mentioned above, is important to consider as it is an important premise of Ericsson's theoretical framework for deliberate practice.  He finds that because participating in deliberate practice is not motivating that individuals must be engaged and motivated to take part in improvement before deliberate practice can even take place.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He talks about the success of children who were simply exposed to an activity for months by their parents in a fun way.  These children displayed immense interest in continuing the activity, so the parents then began implanting deliberate practice.  This came to be extremely successful, which Ericsson cites as proof that his theory works when put into action.  He finds that children must have the passion to improve their skills before deliberate practice begins in order to really be successful.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Deliberate practice in medical education==
Duvivier et al. reconstructed the concept of deliberate practice into practical principles to describe the process as it relates to clinical skill acquisition. They defined deliberate practice as:
#repetitive performance of intended cognitive or psychomotor skills.
#rigorous skills assessment
#specific information feedback
#better skills performance''&lt;ref name="Duvivier_2011"&gt;Duvivier, R. J., van Dalen, J., Muijtjens, A. M., Moulaert, V., Van der Vleuten, C., Scherpbier, A. (2011). The role of deliberate practice in the acquisition of clinical skills. ''BMC Medical Education, 11'': 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

They further described the personal skills learners need to exhibit at various stages of skill development in order to be successful in developing their clinical skills. This includes:
#planning (organize work in a structured way).
#concentration/dedication (higher attention span)
#repetition/revision (strong tendency to practice)
#study style/self reflection (tendency to self-regulate learning)''&lt;ref name="Duvivier_2011"/&gt;

While the study only included medical students, the authors found that repetitious practice may only help the novice learner (year 1) because as expertise is developed, the learner must focus and plan their learning around specific deficiencies. Curriculum must be designed to develop students' ability to plan their learning as they progress in their careers.

Finally, the findings in the study also have implications for developing self-regulated behaviors in students. Initially, a medical student may need focused feedback from instructors; however, as they progress, they must develop the ability to self-assess.

==As maintenance==
Skills fade with non-use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wranx.com/what-is-skill-fade-and-how-to-combat-it/|title=SKILL FADE|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon is often referred to as being "out of practice". Practice is therefore performed (on a regular basis) to keep skills and abilities honed.

==History==
Prempeh College was founded through a collaboration between the [[Kumasi]] Traditional Council, the Presbyterian and Methodist churches in the then Gold Coast and the [[British]] Colonial Government. Until 1949, there was no government-assisted secondary school in Ashanti region and the northern sector of Ghana. Most students had to travel to the coastal areas of Ghana to attend established schools such as [[Achimota School]], [[Mfantsipim School|Mfantsipim school]] and others.

In the early 1940s, the British Colonial Government invited the Presbyterian and Methodist Churches, which had already established institutions such as [[Wesley Girls' Senior High School|Wesley Girls High School]] and the [[Presbyterian Boys' Senior High School|Presbyterian Boys Secondary school]] in Krobo Odumase based on their experience, to help set up a school in the middle belt of Ghana to serve the northern sector of the country. Although there were some delays due to the second world war, in 1948 Prempeh College was designed by renowned British modernist Architect [[Maxwell Fry]] and his wife [[Jane Drew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuq_CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=prempeh+college&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzqpOnq_fUAhUhAcAKHesxCfIQ6AEIPzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=prempeh+college&amp;f=false|title=The Architecture of Edwin Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew: Twentieth Century Architecture, Pioneer Modernism and the Tropics|last1=Jackson|first1=Iain|last2=Holland|first2=Jessica|date=16 March 2016|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''There is a great and growing need for training men to take up posts of responsibility not just as clerks in offices but in Agricultural Education, Mining, Forestry, Architecture,Engineering and Building in the many other technical posts on the fulling of which by Africans the future development of Ashanti and the Gold Coast as a whole largely depends … We British from overseas are here to help you ultimately to administer the country yourselves … until you yourselves can provide the agriculturalists, engineers, the technicians and the tradesmen who can develop the natural resources''
of your country.''&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Ashanti Pioneer, 8 February 1949&lt;/ref&gt; In summary the college was expected to produce scientists and technocrats who could play vital roles in the economy of the Gold Coast.At the same opening ceremony, Prempeh II outlined his expectation for Prempeh College: ‘the''
hope that the students of the College would shine not only in the intellectual field but also in the moral fermament'.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; The Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei-Agyemang Prempeh II, took personal interest in the establishment of the school and donated the land for the development of the college. Due to this royal connection the colours of the Ashanti national flag green and yellow (gold) were adopted as the school's official colours. The Ashanti golden stool was added to the school's crest. The [[Golden Stool]] represents the Ashanti symbol of unity which is believed to possess the [[sunsum]] (soul) of the Ashanti people. To this day, a replica of the stool is carried out by the college's prefects during official functions and during academic processions to symbolise the role and influence of the Asantehene in the affairs of the college.[[File:Flag of Ashanti.svg|thumb|left|The Ashanti National Flag]]

Today Prempeh College is the academic home of more than 2,000 young men, of whom the majority reside in the school's 9 boarding houses. The college has a parent body (PTA) and a vibrant Old Boy's Association (AMANFOUR).

The school is headed by a chairman and board of governors, who appoint the headmaster. Prempeh College has nine boys' houses, each headed by a housemaster, selected from the more senior members of the teaching staff.

As of 2012, the headmaster was E. K. Yeboah, a member of CHASS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphic.com.gh/news/education/5329-chass-surprised-at-ges-action-to-suspend-headmaster.html |title=CHASS surprised at GES action to suspend headmaster  |author=Severious Kale-Dery|publisher=Prempeh College Old Students Portal Amanfuo |date=26 November 2013 |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prempeh has grown over time. In 1949, there were 50 boys. In the late 1990s there were about 800, later increasing to over 1,600. Currently, since the inception of the free SHS, population is around 3000. 

==Uniform==
The school uniform includes a green shirt with the college crest. Students wear this to class on a daily basis. For ceremonial purposes students wear a green jacket with an embroidery of the college crest.The college blazer (suit) was in use from the beginning in 1949, was dropped in the 1980s, then revived in 2003. Students wear the college suit for ceremonial purposes, such as speech days and graduation ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amanfoonorthamerica.org/history.html|title=History|website=Prempeh College OLD Students of North America}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students also wear the college wear for ceremonial purposes. All students wear white shirt for evening studies and white shirt with white trousers for Saturday afternoon inspection and also outdoor activities. There are some variations in the school dress worn by boys in authority. The academic staff wear black gowns with kente at the beginning of each terms academic procession and at the speech and at graduation ceremonies.

==School magazine==
The magazine of Prempeh College has long been called ''The Stool''. It is a 100-page document which gives annual reports of the school. With a patron, an editorial board and the SRC, they deliver to the student body the all-formidable magazine. What has always been featured, for example, are perceptions about the school outside, short messages from students of the college to other schools, interviews with alumni and many interesting features.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9384">{{About||the journal called "Public Health"|Public Health (journal)|the journal formerly known as "Public Health Journal"|Canadian Journal of Public Health}}

A '''public health journal''' is a [[scientific journal]] devoted to the field of [[public health]], including [[epidemiology]], [[biostatistics]], and [[health care]] (including [[medicine]], [[nursing]] and related fields). Public health journals, like most scientific journals, are [[peer review|peer-reviewed]]. Public health journals are commonly published by health organizations and societies, such as the ''[[Bulletin of the World Health Organization]]'' or the ''[[Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health]]'' (published by the [[British Medical Association]]). Many others are published by a handful of large publishing corporations that includes [[Elsevier]], [[Wolters Kluwer]], [[Wiley-Blackwell]], [[Springer Science+Business Media]], and [[Informa]], each of which has many [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]]s (which are [[brand]]s named after former independent publishers that were [[mergers and acquisitions|merged or acquired]]). Many societies partner with such corporations to handle the work of producing their journals.

The increase in public health research in recent decades has seen a rapid increase in the number of articles and journals. As such, many public health journals have emerged with a specialized focus, such as in the area of policy (e.g. ''[[Journal of Public Health Policy]]''), a specific region or country of the world (e.g. ''[[Asia-Pacific Journal of Public Health]]'', ''[[Pan American Journal of Public Health]]'' or ''[[Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal]]''), a specific intervention/practice area (e.g. ''[[Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention]]''), or other particular focus (e.g. ''[[Human Resources for Health]]'').

== Scope ==
Public health journals often indicate their target audience as being interdisciplinary, including [[health care provider#Practitioners and professionals|health care professionals]], public health decision-makers and researchers. A main objective is to support [[evidence-based policy]] and [[evidence-based practice]] in public health.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/bulletin/en/ ''Bulletin of the World Health Organization'': Read the ''Bulletin''.] Accessed 21 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Society for Equity in Health. [http://www.equityhealthj.com/about About ''International Journal for Equity in Health''.] Accessed 21 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BioMed Central. [http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcpublichealth/about/ About ''BMC Public Health''.] Accessed 21 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Medical literature#Medical journal|medical journals]] (e.g. ''[[The Lancet]]'') typically focus on reaching medical professionals as their main audience, although the boundaries between these two categories are increasingly blurry.

It has been argued that some medical and public health journals are "filled with increasingly complex science" which depends upon advanced statistics and research methods that health care providers may have difficulty understanding. In response they have turned towards publishing "articles that are more journalism than science" such as reviews, news, and educational material.&lt;ref name=Smith2006/&gt; However, science is what attracts major attention and leads institutions and libraries to purchase subscriptions.&lt;ref name=Smith2006/&gt;

== Review process ==
{{Main|Peer review}}
For an article to be accepted for publication in a public health or medical journal it must typically undergo a review process. Each journal creates its own process, but they have certain common characteristics in general. There are various general "levels" of scrutiny, which have some effect on the respect given to articles published in the journals. Some broad categories might be ''editorial review'', ''peer review'', and ''blind peer review''. [[Richard Smith (editor)|Richard Smith]], former [[editor-in-chief|editor]] of the ''[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'', stated in 2006 that studies had found peer review to be ineffective and prone to abuse, but noted that editors consider it invaluable.&lt;ref name=Smith2006&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith R |title=The trouble with medical journals |journal=J. R. Soc. Med. |volume=99 |issue=3 |pages=115–119 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16508048 |pmc=1383755 |doi=10.1258/jrsm.99.3.115 |url=http://jrsm.rsmjournals.com/cgi/content/full/99/3/115 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902124436/http://jrsm.rsmjournals.com/cgi/content/full/99/3/115 |archivedate=2009-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Editorial review ===
In this process, articles which meet the minimum requirements for submission (such as including the necessary descriptions of funding, privacy and publication releases, ethics/institutional review board approval, statements of original work, signatures of authors, and so on,) are first looked over by a managing editor or a member of an [[editorial board]]. They may be referred back to the authors for revision and resubmission, rejected, or presented to the editorial board for final approval.

=== Peer review ===
A more stringent review process includes a full peer review. After first review by a managing editor or member of an editorial board, an article which has good possibilities will be sent out for review by two or more researchers in the specific area. If these reviews are positive the article may be referred back to the authors to address any comments by the reviewers, or (rarely) may be accepted immediately by the editorial board.

==== Blind peer review ====
One common review process is the same as the peer review above, except all references to the authors are removed from the article before review by the researchers.

==Content==
Most public health journals include various types of content, such as:
* [[Editorial]]
* [[Letter to the Editor]]
* Original [[research]] 
* [[Literature review]], [[systematic review]] and [[meta-analysis]]
* [[Abstract (summary)|Abstract]]s from [[scientific meeting]]s or other journals
* Technical notes

Medical journals may also include, for example, [[case report]]s and [[clinical significance|clinical]] images of interest. Some online journals are also moving to publishing video content (e.g. ''[[Journal of Visualized Experiments]]'').

==Internet and open access==
{{Main|Open access (publishing)|Electronic publishing}}
By the early 21st century, most public health and medical journals were available online, thus increasing their accessibility worldwide. There is a general move from print as primary medium to electronic publication, an example being the online journals published by [[BioMed Central]].

With the advent of online publication, some health journals are transforming from traditional subscription-based and pay-per-view access to [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] for some or all of their content.

==Impact factor==
{{Main|Impact factor}}
Like other scientific journals, many public health journals are ranked with an [[impact factor]], linked to the probability of an article published in that journal being cited. It is currently accepted that a higher impact factor indicates a better journal quality, at least in some health disciplines.&lt;ref name="impact"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-5-24 |pmc=555948|year=2005|last1=López-Abente|first1=Gonzalo|last2=Muñoz-Tinoco|first2=Concha|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=5|pages=24|pmid=15777471|title=Time trends in the impact factor of Public Health journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journals with high impact factors according to the [[Journal Citation Reports]] in the category "Public, Environmental and Occupational Health" include: ''[[Environmental Health Perspectives]]'', ''[[American Journal of Epidemiology]]'', ''[[Annual Review of Public Health]]'', ''Genetic Epidemiology'', ''Epidemiologic Reviews'', ''[[Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention]]'', ''[[International Journal of Epidemiology]]'', [[Epidemiology (journal)|''Epidemiology'']], ''[[Bulletin of the World Health Organization]]'' and ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]''.&lt;ref&gt;University of Massachusetts Medical School. [http://library.umassmed.edu/ebpph/top25.pdf Top 25 Public Health Journals by Impact Factor.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006041704/http://library.umassmed.edu/ebpph/top25.pdf |date=2011-10-06 }} Evidence-Based Practice for Public Health Project, citing ''2005 Journal Citation Reports'' (JCR) Science and Social Science Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;University of Massachusetts Medical School.  [http://library.umassmed.edu/ebpph/top25.cfm Top 25 Public Health Journals.] Evidence-Based Practice for Public Health, citing ''2009 Journal Citation Reports'' (JCR) Science and Social Science Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, given their interdisciplinary nature, some journals with a public health focus may be found in other categories. For example, ''[[Human Resources for Health]]'' is placed in the category "industrial relations and labor", where it was ranked 1st in 2012.

==Early history==
The doors of the library officially opened to the public on February 4, 1986. It opened with a significant donation from the collections of David Irwin but afterwards received donations from individuals across the country. Quatrefoil Library shared space with the Minnesota Civil Liberties Union at 1021 West Broadway in Minneapolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Twin Cities Gaze|last=|first=|date= February 1986|work=Twin Cities Gaze|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen months after its opening, the library moved to a bigger building in [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] to accommodate the growing collection.{{sfn|Keim|2008|p=18}} Early volunteers and supporters include Jean-Nickolaus Tretter of the [[Jean-Nickolaus Tretter Collection in Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Studies|Tretter Collection]], Tim Campbell who provided ad space in his publication and George Holdgrafer of [[Lavender (magazine)|Lavender magazine]]. The library published a newsletter, ''The Gay Bookworm'', which was later christened ''Quatrefolio''.

The library took its name from the novel ''[[Quatrefoil: A Modern Novel]]'' by [[James Fugaté|James Barr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Quatrefoil|last=Barr|first=James|publisher=Greenberg Press|year=1950|isbn=|location=1950|pages=|oclc=542667}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founding member David Irwin had been so impressed with the positive portrayal of homosexuality, that he insisted on naming their collection the Quatrefoil Library.{{sfn|Keim|2008|p=7}}

In 2013, the library moved to its present site in Minneapolis with twice as much space as it had in St. Paul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.qlibrary.org/about-the-library/history/ |title=History |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=Quatrefoil Library |access-date=October 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission statement==
The mission of the Quatrefoil Library is to collect, maintain, document and circulate gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer materials and information in a safe and accessible space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.qlibrary.org/|title=Quatrefoil website|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, the volume of the collection included more 14,000 books, 1,040 DVDs, 2,123 VHS videotapes, 500 periodicals and 1,550 pulp novels.{{sfn|Keim|2008|p=18}} The library also houses a collection of rare and out-of-print books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2016/07/14/books-quatrefoil-library |title=From private collection to lending library: Quatrefoil grows as resource for LGBT community |author=Marianne Combs |date=July 14, 2016 |publisher=[[Minnesota Public Radio|MPR News]] |accessdate=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5874">'''Rappahannock Industrial Academy''' was a school for African American children that operated between 1902 and 1948 near [[Dunnsville, Virginia|Dunnsville]] in [[Essex County, Virginia]]. 

==History==
After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], Virginia's Constitution adopted in 1868 provided for public education, but that for African Americans did not extend beyond seventh grade.

In 1897, the Southside Rappahannock Baptist Association (which consisted of 38 churches, all but two in [[Essex County, Virginia|Essex]], [[King and Queen County|King and Queen]] or [[Middlesex County, Virginia|Middlesex Counties]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southsideassociation.org/|title=SRBA &amp; Allied Bodies|work=southsideassociation.org|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; decided to establish an institution to provide Christian education and stress character development for African American children.&lt;ref name="thehouseandhomemagazine.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rappahannock Industrial Academy|url=http://thehouseandhomemagazine.com/Articles/JanFeb16/RappahannockIndustrialAcademy/tabid/879/Default.aspx|website=thehouseandhomemagazine.com|publisher=The House and Home Magazine|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennie Dean]] had established the [[Manassas Industrial Academy]] a few years earlier, which provided higher education (and boarding opportunities) for African American children, but which was too far for most students from the [[Middle Peninsula]].

By 1900, the Site Committee had raised enough money to purchase a 159 acre farm for $1,200, some of which was provided by the Women's Baptist District Missionary Convention, which received 25 acres to establish a home for the aged.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Eubank Gray, Reflections: Windows on the Past (Lawrenceville: Brunswick Publishing Corporation 1995) p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; For its first year, which began in January 1902, the school used the pre-existing farmhouse, but the following year erected a three story dormitory to accommodate 45 girls and two teachers, as well as a dining hall, chapel and administrative offices. Soon, a second building could house 30 male students, 2 teachers, 3 classrooms, a library and laboratory. The dormitory (and other use) buildings were named for two of the founding pastors, Reverend C. R. Towles and Dr. R. E. Berkley.
&lt;ref name="thehouseandhomemagazine.com"/&gt; An additional 129 acres were purchased in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southsideassociation.org/RIA.html|title=Rappahannock Industrial Academy|work=southsideassociation.org|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903 (after several short-term principals), Professor W. Edward Robinson, a Middlesex County native who had graduated from [[Howard University]] became the academy's principal, a post he would hold for 29 years (until retiring in 1933). His daughter Edwardine Robinson graduated from the Academy, then attended Hartshorn Memorial College (to obtain a high school diploma) and [[Virginia Union  University]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], and returned to teach. Despite its name, the academy offered a college preparatory curriculum, including algebra, geometry, Latin, English and history. A devotional assembly began the students' day, followed by classes beginning at 9 am and ending at 3pm, after which the students could study or engage in recreational activities, including athletics, debating and choral activities.&lt;ref&gt;Gray at 84-86&lt;/ref&gt; The course was initially 2 years, then expanded to 3 years and received state accreditation in 1934. The school's total operational budget from 1902 – 1948 was $107,000, of which students' tuition and fees contributed $53,965, with the rest contributed by the Southside Rappahannock Baptist Association or products sold by the school.&lt;ref name="thehouseandhomemagazine.com"/&gt;

==Today==
The school closed in 1948, after Howard University Law School graduate [[Oliver Hill]] secured a decision of the Virginia Supreme Court requiring free transportation to high schools for students of all races. [[Essex High School (Virginia)|Essex High School]] in [[Tappahannock, Virginia]] acquired the Academy's records. In 1992, graduates raised funds to erect a granite historical marker surrounded by a ring of boxwood by the remaining two gateposts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.dailypress.com/1992-08-05/news/9208050062_1_two-teachers-fee-public-education|title=Gateposts Mark Spot Where Academy Stood|work=dailypress.com|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalmarkerproject.com/markers/HM12ZI_site-of-rappahannock-industrial-academy_Dunnsville-VA.html|title=Site of Rappahannock Industrial Academy - Dunnsville|work=historicalmarkerproject.com|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alumni association also funds one scholarship each year for a student from each of the three original counties, to honor their alma mater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcfrichmond.org/Our-Impact/Impact-Stories/Continuing-a-Legacy-of-Educational-Success|title=Rappahannock Industrial Academy Scholarship|work=tcfrichmond.org|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable alumni of the school include civic activist [[Pauline C. Morton]].&lt;ref name="thehistorymakers.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistorymakers.org/biography/pauline-c-morton-39|title=Pauline C.

'''''The School Magazine''''' is a literary magazine for children which has been published continuously by the [[New South Wales Department of Education and Communities]] in its many incarnations since its first issue in 1916. It was originally subtitled 'A Magazine of Literature for Our Boys and Girls'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The School Magazine of literature for our boys and girls|last = the Department of Education, New South Wales|first = |date = 1 February 1916|journal = The School Magazine of literature for our boys and girls|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Established during World War One, the magazine was intended to expand the range of reading material available to New South Wales primary school students. Stephen Henry Smith was the magazine's first editor, followed by Doris Chadwick, who held the position of editor from 1922 to 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://theschoolmagazine.com.au/about/history|title = History - The School Magazine - going strong since 1916|date = |access-date = 18 January 2016|website = The School Magazine official website|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over its 100-year history, its editors have included some of the best known names of Australian children’s literature: [[Noreen Shelley]], [[Patricia Wrightson]], [[Lilith Norman]], [[Duncan Ball]], [[Anna Fienberg]], Jonathan Shaw and [[Tohby Riddle]]. The list of past and present editorial staff features many authors who have been recognised by awards or by popular acclaim: these include [[Joanne Horniman]], [[Dianne Bates]], [[Cassandra Golds]], [[Margrete Lamond]], [[Geoffrey McSkimming]], [[Ursula Dubosarsky]] and Sue Murray. Some of the many illustrators are Kim Gamble, [[Tohby Riddle]], [[Aaron Blabey]], Stephen Axelsen, Noela Young, Craig Phillips, Sarah Davis] and David Legge. 
The ''School Magazine'' publishes four literary magazines for children: ''Countdown'' ({{issn|1440-4907}}), ''Blast Off'' ({{issn|1440-4885}}), ''Orbit'' ({{issn|1440-4893}}) and ''Touchdown'' ({{issn|1440-4877}}. Each 36-page full-colour magazine contains a mix of stories, plays, poetry, nonfiction articles, book reviews, puzzles, comic serials and other texts.

Published continually since February 1916, the ''School Magazine'' is the oldest magazine in Australia and the longest running literary magazine for children in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/the-school-magazine-turns-100-and-becomes-the-longest-continually-published-childrens-literary-publication-in-the-world-20150216-13fsvp.html|title=The School Magazine turns 100 and becomes the longest continually published children's literary publication in the world|last=Smith|first=Alexandra|date=17 February 2015|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date = 18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine has thrived as a showpiece of original writing for children from authors in Australia, New Zealand, the US, India, the UK, and a number of Asian, Pacific and African nations.

The magazine has played and continues to play a role in fostering new talent in writing for children. In particular, it is the largest publisher of poetry for children in Australia. A number of children’s writers and illustrators who are now justly celebrated were first published by The School Magazine, which still accepts unsolicited manuscripts.

To foster literacy skills, the ''School Magazine'' also publishes Teaching Units, which offer lesson plans and worksheets to assist teachers in maximising the use of the literary material with their students.

It is intended as an adjunct to the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]], which legislated to prevent the unfair treatment of individuals, in the provision of [[goods and services]], unless [[Theory of justification|justification]] could be proved. This legislation was deemed necessary as the previous Act did not encompass educational organisations. This was further replaced by the [[Disability Discrimination Act 2005]].

The act required [[schools]], [[colleges]], [[universities]], [[adult education]] providers, statutory [[youth service]] and [[local education authority|local education authorities]] to make 'reasonable provisions' to ensure people with [[disabilities]] or [[special needs]] were provided with the same opportunities as those who were not disabled.&lt;ref name="aboutld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutlearningdisabilities.co.uk/special-educational-needs-disability-act.html|title=The Special Educational Needs and Disability Act|last=Debenham|first=Lucy|date=31 October 2008|publisher=About Learning Disabilities|accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act stated that [[discrimination]] occurred when the educational establishment/body either fails to make reasonable adjustments to accommodate individuals with special needs or a disability, or when they give them less favourable treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hw.ac.uk/welfare/docs/senda_guidelines.pdf|title=SENDA brief guidelines for lecturers and teachers|publisher=[[Heriot-Watt University]]|location=Edinburgh|accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Temwa''' is a registered UK charity. Operating in [[Malawi]], central [[Africa]], Temwa works mainly in one region known as Usisya on a number of different community driven projects including Education, Health, Skills Development and Agriculture.

==Short history==

Temwa dates back to 2003 when it was founded by two [[Bristol]] girls, Jo Hook and Sophie Elson. The idea was initially conceived three years before while Jo and Sophie were working in Malawi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://temwa.org/about-us.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208003447/http://www.temwa.org/about-us.html |archivedate=2008-12-08 |df= }} Temwa's about page&lt;/ref&gt; After three years of fund raising they returned to Malawi and started to build a community center.

==Current projects==

'''Education''' and '''Schools''' are one of the areas Temwa continue to work in, providing library services and schools support throughout the region of Usisya &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://temwa.org/projects/schools-support.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208003959/http://www.temwa.org/projects/schools-support.html |archivedate=2008-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Health Education''' projects run by Temwa include AIDS Action Clubs and mobile HIV/AIDS testing clinics as well as awareness raising through mobile video shows. Temwa has established HIV &amp; AIDS Action Clubs (AACs) in all 32 primary schools and 6 secondary schools in the Nkhata Bay North region. These provide health education, income-generating activities for orphans and vulnerable children, sport/gaming activities, advocacy and support for youth. Mobile video shows are also run regularly to educate the children. The objective of AACs is to help adolescents prepare to take responsibility for their own sexual and reproductive health in the fight against HIV &amp; AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://temwa.org/projects/health-education.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419015959/http://www.temwa.org/projects/health-education.html |archivedate=2013-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  '''HIV/AIDs''' awareness group Purple Field productions worked with Temwa &lt;ref&gt;http://www.purplefieldproductions.org/?page_id=13#PeopleLikeUs Purple Field Production's project page&lt;/ref&gt; on a project to raise AIDs awareness throughout the region through film.'''HIV/AIDs''' awareness group Purple Field productions worked with Temwa &lt;ref&gt;http://www.purplefieldproductions.org/?page_id=13#PeopleLikeUs Purple Field Production's project page&lt;/ref&gt; on a project to raise AIDs awareness throughout the region.

'''Agriculture''' is encouraged through a range of projects, including a demonstration garden &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://temwa.org/projects/agriculture-and-irrigation.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208003931/http://www.temwa.org/projects/agriculture-and-irrigation.html |archivedate=2008-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an ongoing project with the [[International Tree Foundation]] to plant many fruit and other trees throughout the region.

==Fundraising==

Temwa has a strong association with the [[Bristol]] music scene and gigs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/clubs/2003/04/full_circle_malawi/orphanage.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112235849/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/clubs/2003/04/full_circle_malawi/orphanage.shtml |archivedate=2012-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by many local bands including Babyhead and The Zen Hussies &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bristol.indymedia.org/article/688686 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917123842/http://bristol.indymedia.org/article/688686 |archivedate=2008-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; along with club nights &lt;ref&gt;http://saldsrhench.blogspot.com/2008/07/run-and-temwa.html&lt;/ref&gt; have all helped raise funds for this charity.

Temwa also has raised money through corporate sponsors Commercial Vehicle Solutions &lt;ref&gt;http://www.uk-cvs.com/charity.php&lt;/ref&gt; and the fashionable fundraisers Bottle Top.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bottletop.org/beneficiaries/?/48/Temwa {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411185835/http://www.bottletop.org/beneficiaries/?%2F48%2FTemwa |date=2008-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theos Casimir Bernard''' (1908–1947)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hackett|first=Paul|title=Barbarian Lands: Theos Bernard, Tibet, and the American Religious Life|publisher=Ph.D. dissertation, Columbia University, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[explorer]], and [[author]], known for his work on [[yoga]] and religious studies, particularly in [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theos Casimir Bernard|author=Paul G. Hackett |publisher=[[Columbia University]]|url=http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/theos_casimir_bernard.html|date=15 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the nephew of [[Pierre Bernard (yogi)|Pierre Arnold Bernard]].

==Biography==

Bernard first trained in law, obtaining a [[bachelor's degree]] in 1931 and embarking on an internship in 1932, but decided instead to pursue an advanced degree at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;Hackett, 196–197&lt;/ref&gt; There, according to 2010's ''The Madman's Middle Way'', Bernard, who described himself as "the first white [[lama]]", became the first American to write a dissertation on the subject of Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;ref name=Lopez&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald S. Lopez Jr.|author-link=Donald S. Lopez Jr.|title=The Madman's Middle Way: Reflections on Reality of the Tibetan Monk Gendun Chopel|date=15 May 2007|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=978-0-226-49317-6|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, he toured India and Tibet with his wife, Viola Wertheim Bernard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=http://omnipotentoom.com/archives/119|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (half-sister of [[Maurice Wertheim]]), studying [[Tantric Yoga]] in an effort to master its fundamental principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Syman|first=Stefanie|title=The Subtle Body: The Story of Yoga in America|date=22 June 2010|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-374-23676-2|pages= 119–120, 122.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return to the United States in 1937, his experiences were published across the country over several weeks by the [[North American Newspaper Alliance]] and [[Bell Syndicate]].&lt;ref&gt;Syman, 123.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a series of lectures and radio appearances in 1939 and by the publication of the [[memoir]] ''Penthouse of the Gods''.&lt;ref&gt;Hackett, 687-690.&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard was also featured in popular magazines, including a cover story in ''[[Family Circle]]'' in 1939, followed shortly by his second book, ''Heaven Lies Within Us'', which explored [[Hatha Yoga]] under the guise of an auto-biography.&lt;ref&gt;Hackett, 695-701&lt;/ref&gt; According to 2008's ''Barbarian Lands'', many of the experiences Bernard describes in his books have recently been discovered to have been fabricated, based on the experiences of his father.&lt;ref&gt;Hackett, 694-702.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, Bernard opened the American Institute of Yoga and Pierre Health Studios.&lt;ref&gt;Hackett, 726-730&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Syman, 132&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1940s Bernard completed his [[Ph.D.]] at [[Columbia University]] under the supervision of [[Herbert Schneider (philosopher)|Herbert Schneider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Life and Works of Theos Bernard|url=http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/theos_bernard_scholar.html|website=columbia.edu|publisher=[[Columbia University]]|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1947, he again visited northern India, on an expedition to the [[Ki monastery]] in Tibet in an attempt to discover special manuscripts. In October,  while in an area  of Pakistan, Inter-communal violence broke out in the section of the hills that he and his Tibetan companion were travelling. It was reported that both were shot and their bodies thrown in a river.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;This account of the death of Theos Bernard was related by G.A. Bernard, Theos' father&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernard|first1=Theos|title=Hatha yoga|date=1982|publisher=Rider|isbn=0091500516|page=vi|edition=Fourth impression of the revised edition (1968)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was declared dead several months later, though his body was never found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Love|first=Robert|title=The Great Oom: The Improbable Birth of Yoga in America|year= 2010|publisher=Viking Adult|isbn=|page= 315}}&lt;/ref&gt;
